The wrench slipped, a metallic shriek echoing in the cavernous space, followed by the satisfying *thunk* of it landing in a puddle of surprisingly clean, surprisingly lukewarm sewage.  Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, licensed plumber extraordinaire (or at least, that's what his battered van claimed), swore under his breath, the words muffled by the thick grime coating his already soot-stained overalls.  He was knee-deep in the labyrinthine bowels of the Blackwood Manor, a Gothic monstrosity clinging precariously to the cliffside overlooking the churning grey expanse of the North Sea.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth, decaying wood, and something vaguely floral, but undeniably sinister.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful dirge, rattling the ancient stained-glass windows high above.  Barty shivered, but not entirely from the cold.  This job was already giving him the creeps, and he hadn't even located the source of the blockage yet.
