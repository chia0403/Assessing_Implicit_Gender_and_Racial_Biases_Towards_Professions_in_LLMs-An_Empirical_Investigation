The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Amy” Hawthorne’s perfectly coiffed auburn bob across her face as she wrestled the battered sample case onto the porch of the Blackwood Manor.  Rain, a relentless, sideways drizzle, plastered her tailored wool coat to her frame.  Blackwood Manor, perched precariously on a cliff overlooking the churning grey expanse of the Atlantic, was the kind of place that inspired both awe and a profound sense of unease.  Ivy, thick as pythons, clawed at the crumbling stone façade, hinting at secrets buried deep within the decaying grandeur. Amy adjusted her grip on the case, its contents – a dazzling array of handcrafted, exorbitantly priced kitchen knives – feeling strangely insignificant against the brooding weight of the ancient house.  This wasn't your average suburban kitchen knife demonstration; this was a challenge, a high-stakes sales call that could make or break her commission for the year.  And frankly, Amy Hawthorne wasn't one for losing.
