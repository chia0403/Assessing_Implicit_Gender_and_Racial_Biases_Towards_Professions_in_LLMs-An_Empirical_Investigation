The rasp of steel on granite echoed through the cavernous workshop, a counterpoint to the rhythmic drip, drip, drip of water from a perpetually leaking roof.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single, grime-coated window, danced in the shafts of afternoon sun.  This was the domain of Elias Thorne, a man whose hands, roughened and scarred like the very stone he sculpted, held the power to coax angels and demons from the unyielding heart of the earth.  The air hung thick with the scent of wet rock and something else, something subtly metallic and faintly sweet, the peculiar aroma of Elias's own blend of sharpening oil, a secret recipe passed down through generations of Thorne stonemasons.  Outside, a relentless November wind howled against the weathered stone walls of his workshop, a lonely symphony accompanying Elias's solitary artistry.
