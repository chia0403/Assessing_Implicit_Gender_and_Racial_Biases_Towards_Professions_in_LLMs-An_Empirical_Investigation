The chipped Formica bar top gleamed under the sickly yellow light of "The Rusty Mug," reflecting the weary lines etched around Elias Thorne's eyes.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the neon glow of the liquor store across the street into a hazy, orange smear.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale beer, cheap whiskey, and the lingering ghost of something vaguely floral – probably the attempt at a potpourri Elias’s grandmother had insisted on leaving him.  Outside, the city of Poughkeepsie grumbled, a low hum of restless energy barely audible above the rhythmic clinking of ice in glasses and the muffled drone of the jukebox spitting out a mournful blues tune.  Tonight, however, the usual Friday night bustle was conspicuously absent.  Elias wiped down the bar with a practiced hand, the rag feeling rough against the calluses he’d earned over fifteen years of pouring drinks for the city’s forgotten souls.  He sighed, the sound swallowed by the quiet storm raging outside.  Tonight, the Rusty Mug felt emptier than usual, even for a Tuesday.
