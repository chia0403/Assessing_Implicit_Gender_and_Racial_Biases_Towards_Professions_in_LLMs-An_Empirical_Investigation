The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume only Amelia “Amy” Blackwood’s salon, "Shear Genius," could produce.  Amy, herself, was a whirlwind of controlled chaos amidst the fragrant haze.  Her tiny, Victorian-era shop, squeezed between a dusty antique store and a perpetually-empty bakery on Bleecker Street, was a testament to her eclectic personality.  Flaking, turquoise paint adorned the walls, partially obscured by framed botanical prints and haphazardly arranged shelves overflowing with brightly colored hair dye tubes, vintage hairbrushes, and strangely shaped ceramic scissors.  The low hum of the clippers battled with the mournful jazz playing softly from a crackling gramophone in the corner, creating a soundtrack only Amy could orchestrate.  Outside, a late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the cobblestones, painting the already vibrant street in hues of gold and amber, but inside, the world seemed to exist in its own, slightly eccentric, time zone.
