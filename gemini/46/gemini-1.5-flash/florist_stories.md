The scent of lilies, heady and almost cloying, hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the crisp autumn morning outside.  Sunlight, fractured by the stained-glass window depicting a riotous bouquet of sunflowers, dappled the worn wooden floorboards of "Petals & Promises," Amelia Grace Hawthorne's flower shop.  Amelia, herself, was a whirlwind of auburn curls and floral-print aprons, humming a jaunty tune as she meticulously arranged a cascade of burgundy dahlias into a breathtaking funeral wreath.  Outside, the grey London sky threatened rain, but inside, amongst the vibrant blooms, a different kind of storm was brewing â€“ one far more personal than the impending downpour.
