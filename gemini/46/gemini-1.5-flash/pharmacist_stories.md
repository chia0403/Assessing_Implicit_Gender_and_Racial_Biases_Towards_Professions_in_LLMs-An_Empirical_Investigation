The humid Louisiana air hung heavy, thick with the scent of honeysuckle and impending rain.  Cicadas buzzed a relentless, rhythmic counterpoint to the rhythmic *click-click-click* of Eleanor Vance’s mortar and pestle.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single bare bulb hanging above her ancient wooden worktable, danced in the suffocating stillness of Vance's Apothecary.  Eleanor Vance, a woman whose age was as carefully guarded as the potent concoctions she brewed, meticulously ground the dried petals of hibiscus, her brow furrowed in concentration.  Outside, the first fat raindrops began to splatter against the dusty windowpanes, mirroring the subtle crackle of electricity in the air, a tension that mirrored the simmering unease brewing in her own heart.  This wasn’t just another humid July evening in the sleepy bayou town of Cypress Bend; tonight, something felt different. Something…dangerous.
