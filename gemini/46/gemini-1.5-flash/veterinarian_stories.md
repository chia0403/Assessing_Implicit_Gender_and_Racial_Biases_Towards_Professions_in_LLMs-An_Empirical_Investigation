The salt spray stung Dr. Eleanor Vance's face as she wrestled the recalcitrant outboard motor into life.  The dawn sky over the Outer Banks was a bruised purple, bleeding into a hesitant orange at the horizon.  Around her, the small fishing boat, *The Wandering Gull*, bucked gently against the restless Atlantic, the rhythmic slap of waves against its hull a counterpoint to the sputtering engine.  The air smelled of brine, seaweed, and something faintly…fishy.  Not unpleasant, exactly, just…present.  Eleanor squinted, her gaze sweeping across the churning grey water towards the distant, hazy silhouette of Hatteras Island.  Another day, another emergency call. This one, however, felt different, heavier than the usual tangled fishing line or injured pelican.  A sense of foreboding, as thick and cloying as the morning mist, clung to the air.
