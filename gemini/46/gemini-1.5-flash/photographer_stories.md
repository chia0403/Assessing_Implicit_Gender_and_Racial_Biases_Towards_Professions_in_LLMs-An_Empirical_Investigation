The salt spray stung Amelia Stoneâ€™s face, a familiar kiss from the unforgiving Atlantic.  She braced herself against the relentless wind, the biting chill seeping through the thick layers of wool she wore.  The lighthouse, a stoic sentinel against the churning grey sea, loomed before her, its whitewashed walls scarred by decades of brutal storms.  Amelia adjusted the worn leather strap of her vintage Hasselblad, the familiar weight grounding her amidst the chaotic beauty of the storm-wracked coastline of Cornwall.  The air thrummed with the raw power of the ocean, a symphony of crashing waves and screaming gulls, a perfect backdrop for the project that had brought her to this remote, windswept corner of the world.  This was more than just a photo shoot; it was a pilgrimage.
