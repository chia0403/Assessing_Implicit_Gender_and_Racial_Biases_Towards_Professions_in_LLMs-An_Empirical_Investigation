The rain hammered against the towering glass facade of the Zenith Hotel, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic thrumming in  Alistair Finch's chest.  Alistair, a man whose tailored suit usually projected an image of effortless calm, felt anything but.

Tonight, however, felt less like a well-oiled machine and more like a runaway train hurtling towards a very unpleasant derailment. The scent of expensive lilies and damp wool hung heavy in the air of the concierge desk, a stark contrast to the electric tension coiled around him like a venomous snake.  He glanced at the almost comically oversized clock above the reception area â€“ 11:57 PM.  Two minutes until midnight. Two minutes until everything changed.
