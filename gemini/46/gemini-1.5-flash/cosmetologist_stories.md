The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a strangely comforting perfume unique to Serenity & Scissors, the salon Isabella “Izzy” Rodriguez had poured her heart and soul into for the past five years.  Rain lashed against the oversized windows of the quaint, Victorian-era building nestled on a quiet, cobbled street in the heart of Savannah, Georgia.  The rhythmic drumming on the glass was a counterpoint to the low hum of the hair dryers and the gentle chatter of Izzy’s two stylists,  a soothing soundtrack to the chaos that always seemed to simmer just beneath the surface of a busy Friday afternoon.  Izzy, her own dark curls pulled back in a practical knot, was currently battling a particularly stubborn tangle of platinum blonde, muttering under her breath as she worked.  Outside, the Spanish moss draped from ancient oaks like mournful ghosts, swaying in the tempest.  Inside, the warmth of the salon, the comforting familiarity of the tools in her hands, and the promise of transformation offered a temporary refuge from the storm, both inside and out.
