The stale scent of sawdust and mothballs hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Isadora “Izzy” Bellweather.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single bare bulb swinging precariously above, danced in the gloom of the abandoned theatre.  Crimson velvet, once opulent, now clung to the crumbling seats like a shroud.  The stage, a vast, echoing emptiness, was littered with the debris of forgotten productions: a tarnished crown lay beside a chipped porcelain doll, a rusting sword leaning against a stack of moth-eaten playbills advertising long-dead melodramas.  Izzy, her practical tweed jacket pulled tight against the autumn chill seeping through the cracked windows, ran a gloved hand along the dusty proscenium arch. This wasn't just any derelict theatre; this was the Grand Majestic, a legendary venue that had fallen silent decades ago, a silent testament to a golden age of theatre that Izzy, with her audacious ambition, was determined to resurrect.
