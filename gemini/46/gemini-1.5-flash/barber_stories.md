The rusty swing sign creaked a mournful tune in the humid Louisiana air, the faded lettering barely whispering "Armand Joseph Thibodeaux, Barber."  Armand, a man whose life was as meticulously groomed as the sideburns he sculpted daily, sat perched on a worn leather stool behind his solitary barber chair.  The air in his shop, nestled on the edge of Bayou Teche, hung thick with the scent of Bay Rum and the lingering sweetness of sugarcane from the nearby fields.  Dust motes danced in the slivers of sunlight that pierced the gloom filtering through the grimy windowpanes, illuminating the chipped porcelain sink and the collection of chipped, dusty trophies lining the walls – remnants of Armand’s glory days as a state wrestling champion, a secret only a handful of his most loyal customers knew.  Outside, the bayou whispered its secrets, the rhythmic lapping of water a counterpoint to the incessant chirping of cicadas, a soundtrack to Armand’s quiet, solitary existence.
