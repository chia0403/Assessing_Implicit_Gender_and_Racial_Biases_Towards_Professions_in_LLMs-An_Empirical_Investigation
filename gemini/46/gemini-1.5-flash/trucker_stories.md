The biting Montana wind howled a mournful tune around Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins' rig, a symphony of icy grit against the polished chrome of his eighteen-wheeler.  The cab, a well-worn but lovingly maintained Kenworth W900, smelled of stale coffee, diesel fumes, and the faint, lingering scent of pine from a recent load of lumber.  Outside, the vast, snow-dusted plains stretched to the horizon, the only landmarks the skeletal silhouettes of distant buttes, black against the bruised purple of the twilight sky.  Bart, his face weathered like the leather of his worn driving gloves, squinted at the swirling snow, a fresh layer already coating the windshield.  He was stranded, miles from the nearest town, his trusty CB radio spitting only static.  The emergency lights pulsed weakly, tiny beacons against the encroaching darkness.  Tonight, the unforgiving beauty of the Montana winter held him captive.
