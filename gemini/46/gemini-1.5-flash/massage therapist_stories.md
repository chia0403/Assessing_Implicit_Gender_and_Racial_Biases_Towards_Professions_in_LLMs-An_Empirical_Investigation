The scent of sandalwood and eucalyptus hung heavy in the air, a fragrant counterpoint to the low hum of the air purifier and the rhythmic ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner.  Rain lashed against the leaded-glass windows of Serenity Spa, a relentless drumming that mirrored the nervous flutter in Amelia Katherine Holloway's chest.  Amelia, a massage therapist with hands as deft as a surgeon's and a heart as soft as the warmed lavender oil she used, wasn't nervous about the technicalities of her upcoming appointment.  She’d massaged stressed CEOs, Olympic athletes, and even a grumpy badger once (don't ask).  No, this apprehension stemmed from the client's identity:  renowned mystery novelist, and rumored recluse, Silas Blackwood.  His reputation preceded him – a man of shadows and secrets, who allegedly hadn't stepped foot in a public space in five years.  And yet, here he was, booked for a ninety-minute deep tissue massage, supposedly recommended by his equally enigmatic doctor. Amelia adjusted the fluffy white towels on the massage table, her fingers tracing the embroidered Serenity Spa logo.  Tonight, she wasn't just working muscles; she was entering a world beyond the gentle kneading and soothing strokes.
