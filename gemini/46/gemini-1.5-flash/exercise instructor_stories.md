Outside, the pre-dawn sky bled from bruised purple to hesitant rose, a silent promise of a beautiful day, a stark contrast to the slightly grim reality of another Zumba class about to descend upon her.  The rhythmic thump of bass from the studio next door already hinted at the impending cacophony, a sound that simultaneously thrilled and slightly terrified her.
