The chipped porcelain teacup warmed Dr. Eleanor Vance’s fingers, a stark contrast to the icy November rain lashing against the mullioned windows of her office.  Her practice, nestled in a converted Victorian townhouse on the edge of Ashwood’s cobbled market square, was usually a haven of calm, a sanctuary from the city’s frenetic energy.
