The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorne’s worn work boots, stinging his exposed cheeks despite the thick woolen scarf pulled high.  Dust, the gritty residue of a demolished warehouse, swirled in the air like a phantom snowstorm.  The skeletal remains of the building – jagged concrete teeth against the bruised purple sky – loomed over him, a monument to demolition and the quiet, methodical work of Elias and his crew.  The air hung heavy with the smell of pulverized brick, diesel fumes, and something else, something subtly metallic and sharp that Elias couldn't quite place, a scent clinging to the damp earth like a lingering fear.  He adjusted his hard hat, the familiar weight a comforting anchor against the chaotic symphony of jackhammers, earthmovers, and the distant wail of a siren, a sound that, in this part of the city, was as commonplace as the rising sun.
