The air in “Sweet Surrender,” Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s cake decorating studio, hung thick with the scent of vanilla bean and impending doom.  Not the doom of a collapsing soufflé, mind you, but the doom of a deadline.  Specifically, the deadline for Lord Ashworth's extravagant 60th birthday cake, a three-tiered monstrosity depicting a meticulously detailed miniature replica of Ashworth Manor, complete with edible ivy and tiny, painstakingly piped figurines of his prize-winning hunting hounds.  Amelia, surrounded by a chaotic landscape of buttercream roses, fondant swans, and a rogue dusting of sugar pearls, surveyed the scene with a sigh that seemed to wilt even the sturdy sugar orchids on her work table.  Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the cobblestone street of quaint, seaside  Port Blossom, but inside Sweet Surrender, the only light came from the harsh glare of her work lamps, highlighting every imperfection in her masterpiece – or rather, her near-disaster.
