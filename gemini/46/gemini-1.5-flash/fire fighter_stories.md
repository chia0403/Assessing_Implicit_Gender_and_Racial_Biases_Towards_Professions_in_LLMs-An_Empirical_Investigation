The acrid bite of woodsmoke stung Captain Elias Thorne’s nostrils, a familiar companion in his thirty-year career with the Redwood Creek Fire Department.  Crimson and gold flames, like hungry beasts, gnawed at the ancient redwood’s base, their crackling a morbid symphony against the backdrop of the howling wind.  The air itself vibrated with the intensity of the blaze, a heat so fierce it shimmered above the burning timber.  Elias, sweat plastering his already soot-stained uniform to his back, squinted through the smoke, his gaze searching for a break in the inferno – a place to strategically deploy his crew, a sliver of hope in the face of a conflagration that threatened to consume the entire Redwood National Park. The scent of pine and burning earth filled his lungs, a bitter tang that promised a long, arduous night.
