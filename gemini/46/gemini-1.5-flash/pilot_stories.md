The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful song around Captain Evelyn "Evie"  Montgomery's battered Cessna 185, whipping snow into a frenzy that obscured the already fading light.  Below, the Chugach Mountains clawed at the bruised purple sky, their snow-laden peaks jagged teeth against the encroaching darkness.  Evie shivered, not entirely from the cold.  Her knuckles were white as she gripped the yoke, her breath misting in the frigid cockpit. The radio crackled with static, a mocking counterpoint to the rhythmic thump of the engine, the only reliable sound in this desolate wilderness. Tonight, the unforgiving Alaskan landscape wasn't just a backdrop to her flight; it felt like a malevolent entity, determined to swallow her whole.  Her mission: a desperate medical evacuation from a remote logging camp, shrouded in a blizzard that had already claimed one life.  The fate of another hung precariously in the balance, and Evie, alone in the unforgiving expanse, was their only hope.
