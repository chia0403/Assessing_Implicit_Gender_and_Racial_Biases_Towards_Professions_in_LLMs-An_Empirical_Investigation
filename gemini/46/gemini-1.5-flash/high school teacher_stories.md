The biting November wind whipped Amelia Jean Hawthorne’s auburn hair across her face as she hurried across the deserted school parking lot.  Dead leaves, the color of dried blood, skittered across the asphalt, mimicking the frantic rhythm of her own heart.  Northwood High, usually a vibrant hive of teenage energy, was eerily silent under the bruised purple sky.

The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying vegetation, held a chill that went deeper than the bone-penetrating wind.  Inside, the echoing silence of the mostly empty building promised nothing but the quiet dread of grading papers and facing another Monday morning.  Amelia shivered, not entirely from the cold.
