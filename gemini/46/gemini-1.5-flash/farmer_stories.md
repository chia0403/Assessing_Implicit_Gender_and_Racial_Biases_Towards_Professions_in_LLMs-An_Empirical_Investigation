The rasping cough that wracked Elias Thorne's body echoed through the pre-dawn stillness of the valley, a sound as familiar as the crowing of the roosters that usually heralded the start of his day. But this wasn't a usual day.  A thick, unnatural fog, the colour of bruised plums, clung to the slopes of the Whisperwind Mountains, obscuring even the familiar silhouette of Widow’s Peak.  It hadn’t rained in weeks, yet the air hung heavy with a dampness that chilled Elias to the bone, a dampness that smelled not of earth and rain, but of something… else. Something ancient, and unsettlingly still.  His small farm, nestled amongst the rolling hills of Oakhaven Valley, usually bustled with the rhythm of his work, but today, an unnerving quiet reigned, broken only by the rasping of his lungs and the low moan of the wind whispering secrets through the parched corn stalks.
