The chipped teal paint of the "Mani-Cure Me" salon door peeled back like sunburnt skin, revealing faded wood underneath.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of acetone and a faint, almost imperceptible, undercurrent of desperation.  Dust motes danced in the weak afternoon sun filtering through the grimy window, illuminating the chipped porcelain sink and the peeling floral wallpaper.  This was not the glamorous nail salon experience advertised in glossy magazines; this was reality, and reality, for thirty-two-year-old Esmeralda "Esme" Rodriguez, was a battlefield fought one chipped polish job at a time.  Esme, perched on her worn stool, stared at the cracked screen of her ancient smart phone, her perfectly manicured – albeit slightly smudged –  nails drumming a restless rhythm against the worn Formica tabletop.  Another slow Tuesday. Another mountain of bills looming larger than the towering stack of nail polish bottles behind her.
