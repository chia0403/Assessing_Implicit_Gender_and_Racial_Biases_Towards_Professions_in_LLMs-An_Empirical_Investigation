The whirring of the suction contraption, a constant, low hum that had become the soundtrack to Amelia Grace Hawthorne's life, was almost drowned out by the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the relentless July rain against the window of Dr. Albright's practice.

The scent of peppermint fluoride mingled with the damp, earthy smell of the storm drifting in through the slightly ajar window, creating an oddly comforting aroma in the sterile environment of the dental surgery.  This wasn't her favourite kind of day, the kind where the relentless rain seemed to seep into your bones and mirror the pervasive weariness clinging to her.  But it was a Tuesday, and Tuesdays meant Mr. Henderson and his surprisingly strong jaw.
