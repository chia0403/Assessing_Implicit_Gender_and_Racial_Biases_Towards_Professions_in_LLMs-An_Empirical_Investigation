The greasy scent of motor oil clung to Amelia Hernandez like a second skin, a familiar perfume that spoke of long hours spent wrestling with temperamental engines.  Her small, cluttered garage, tucked away on a forgotten corner of Sycamore Street, hummed with a low, rhythmic thrum – the comforting drone of a dozen aging vehicles awaiting resurrection.  Sunlight, fractured by the grimy windows, illuminated dust motes dancing in the air, each one a tiny speck of forgotten time, mirroring the layers of grime that coated every surface, from the workbench overflowing with tools to the faded ‘Hernandez Auto Repair’ sign hanging askew above the door.  Outside, the humid Louisiana air hung heavy and still, promising another sweltering afternoon, but Amelia, already knee-deep in the disassembled engine of a vintage Mustang, barely noticed.  The world outside faded; only the metallic symphony of her work held her attention.
