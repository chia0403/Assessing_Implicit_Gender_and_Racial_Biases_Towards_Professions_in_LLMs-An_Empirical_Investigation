The chipped paint of the "Welcome to Ms. Eleanor Vance's Sunflower Room!" sign flaked onto the worn linoleum floor, mirroring the slow disintegration of Eleanor's meticulously planned schedule.  It was 7:45 AM, a time normally filled with the cheerful chaos of tiny humans clamoring for glitter glue and building blocks, but today, a thick, unnatural silence hung over Sunflower Room 2B at Oakwood Elementary.  Outside, the usually vibrant October morning was muted by a relentless drizzle, the grey sky mirroring the leaden weight in Eleanor's chest.  The air, usually thick with the scent of crayons and slightly-too-sweet juice boxes, held only the faint, almost imperceptible, aroma of damp wool and somethingâ€¦ else.  Something vaguely metallic and unsettling.
