The static crackled, a familiar, almost comforting hiss in the otherwise silent shack perched precariously on the edge of the Whispering Pines cliff.  Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless drumming that mirrored the frantic thump-thump-thump of Elias Thorne’s heart.  Elias, a man whose life revolved around the precise tuning of frequencies and the delicate balance of vacuum tubes, found himself hopelessly out of tune with the erratic signal currently assaulting his ears.  The small, cluttered room, smelling of ozone and damp earth, was his sanctuary, his workshop, a refuge from the tempest outside – but tonight, even this haven felt threatened.  His workbench, a chaotic landscape of soldering irons, spare parts, and half-finished projects, was illuminated by a single bare bulb swinging gently from a frayed wire, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to mock his efforts.  The radio, a behemoth of gleaming brass and Bakelite, sputtered and wheezed, its dial stubbornly refusing to settle on anything but a symphony of white noise punctuated by bursts of unintelligible, panicked shouting.  This wasn't just static; this was a cry for help.
