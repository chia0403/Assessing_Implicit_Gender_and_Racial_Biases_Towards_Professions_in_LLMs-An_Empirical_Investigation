The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Isabella “Izzy” Diaz’s office, a relentless percussion accompanying the equally relentless drip, drip, drip from a leak somewhere near the ceiling.  The single bare bulb hanging precariously above her desk cast long, wavering shadows across the cramped space, illuminating dust motes dancing in the gloom.

The air hung thick with the smell of stale cigarettes and desperation – a familiar aroma in her corner of the city, a gritty, rain-slicked pocket of San Francisco known as the Tenderloin.  Outside, the sirens wailed a mournful symphony, a constant backdrop to the lives lived – and often lost – within these shadowed streets.
