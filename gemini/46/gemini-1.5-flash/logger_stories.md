The biting wind howled a mournful song through the skeletal branches of the ancient Douglas firs, whistling a tune only Elias Thorne understood.  Elias, a man carved from the same rugged granite as the Cascade Mountains that surrounded him, gripped the worn handle of his axe with calloused hands.  The air, thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, tasted of coming snow.  He stood at the edge of the Widow's Woods, a tract of timber so dense and unforgiving it earned its name not from a tragic event, but from the sheer difficulty of wresting its bounty from the unforgiving slopes.  The sun, a weak, watery disc sinking below the jagged peaks, cast long, skeletal shadows that danced with the swirling snow, promising a harsh winter ahead.  This was his livelihood, his lifeblood, his curse and his solace all rolled into one: the relentless, unforgiving embrace of the forest.
