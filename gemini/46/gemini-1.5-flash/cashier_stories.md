The fluorescent hum of the "Quick Stop Mart" lights buzzed a monotonous rhythm against the relentless patter of rain lashing against the corrugated iron roof.  Water streamed down the grimy windows, blurring the already indistinct view of the deserted highway beyond.  Inside, the air hung thick with the cloying sweetness of stale donuts and the faint, metallic tang of old coffee.  Behind the chipped Formica counter, Amelia Grace Hawthorne, a young woman whose auburn braid was perpetually escaping its haphazard bun, stared blankly at the flickering digital clock.  It read 2:17 AM. Another hour until her shift ended. Another hour of listening to the rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* of her own heart echoing the drumming rain.  Another hour of waiting for something – anything – to happen.
