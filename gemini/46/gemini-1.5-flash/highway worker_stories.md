The rasping shriek of metal on metal sliced through the pre-dawn quiet, a sound Elias Thorne, Jr. knew intimately.  He'd heard it a thousand times, each screech a prelude to another day spent battling the relentless onslaught of impatient drivers and unforgiving asphalt on Highway 17.  The air, thick with the smell of diesel fumes and freshly cut grass, hung heavy and still over the shoulder of the road, where the skeletal remains of a demolished guardrail lay scattered like fallen teeth.  The rising sun, a bruised plum bleeding across the eastern sky, cast long shadows across the freshly poured concrete, still slick and gleaming under the weak light.  Elias, his hands already stained ochre from the day's first shovelful of gravel, adjusted the worn brim of his hard hat and sighed.  Another day, another patch, another near-miss with death.  Today's project:  Mile Marker 42, where the pavement had buckled and threatened to swallow a passing vehicle whole.
