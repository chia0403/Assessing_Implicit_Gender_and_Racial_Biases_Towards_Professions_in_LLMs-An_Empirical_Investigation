The salt spray stung Detective Inspector Alistair Finch’s face as the November wind howled a mournful dirge across the desolate Cornish coastline.  Rain lashed down, blurring the already indistinct cliffs into grey, dripping monoliths.  Below, the churning Atlantic roared its displeasure, the waves crashing against the jagged rocks with a violence that mirrored the turmoil in Alistair’s gut.  He gripped his worn leather jacket tighter, the collar pulled high against the biting wind, his gaze fixed on the small, isolated cove where the body had been found – a crumpled, lifeless shape amongst the seaweed and scattered debris. The air, thick with the scent of brine and something else… something metallic and sickeningly sweet, promised a grim investigation. This wasn't the picturesque postcard Cornwall; this was a place where secrets were buried as deep as the ocean floor.
