The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face as he hauled the last of the day's catch – a glistening, silver-scaled mackerel – onto the slick deck of the *Sea Serpent*.  The air hung thick with the smell of brine, seaweed, and something faintly acrid, a reminder of the recent storm that had battered the craggy coast of Cornwall.  Below, nestled between the towering cliffs and the restless Atlantic, the tiny fishing village of Portwenn huddled like a collection of weathered, grey stones, its thatched roofs barely visible through the swirling mist.  Elias, his hands roughened by years of wrestling with fish and fire, wiped his brow with the back of his hand, the salty moisture leaving a white crust.  He wasn’t a fisherman, not anymore.  He was a cook, and tonight, he had a reputation to uphold.  The annual Portwenn Seafood Festival was just hours away, and his legendary fisherman’s stew was the main event.
