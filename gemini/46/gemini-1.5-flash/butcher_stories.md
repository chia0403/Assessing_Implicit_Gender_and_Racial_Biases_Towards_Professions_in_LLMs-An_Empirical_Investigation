The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of blood and iron, a perfume Archibald "Archie" Bartholomew had come to find comforting, even familiar.  It clung to him, this scent of the abattoir, a second skin woven from the sinew and sweat of his thirty years as a butcher at Bartholomew's, a shop his grandfather had founded, a legacy carved in bone and gristle.  The shop itself, a squat, brick building wedged between a bustling bakery and a perpetually gloomy pawnbroker's, sat on the edge of Grimsboroughâ€™s old market square.  Cobblestones, worn smooth by centuries of footfall and the rumble of carts, formed the uneven pavement outside.  A flickering gas lamp cast long, dancing shadows across the rows of hanging sausages, their plump skins glistening under the weak light, a stark contrast to the deep crimson of the beef hanging in the window.  Inside, the air was cooler, the chill of the meat lockers a welcome relief from the humid summer evening.
