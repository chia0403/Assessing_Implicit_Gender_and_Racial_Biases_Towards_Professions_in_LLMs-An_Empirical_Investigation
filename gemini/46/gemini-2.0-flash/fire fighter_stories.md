## The Opening:

The alarm shrieked, a high-pitched, insistent wail that sliced through the pre-dawn quiet of the firehouse like a hot knife through butter. It vibrated through every bone in Firefighter Ava Rosalie Dubois' body, yanking her from a restless sleep plagued by the smoky ghosts of yesterday's three-alarm blaze. She swore under her breath, a silent prayer for the residents caught in whatever nightmare awaited them, and threw back the covers. The familiar adrenaline surged through her veins, banishing the lingering fatigue. This was it. This was why she was here.

## The Setting:

**Fire Station 17, "The Steel Serpents," nestled in the heart of the industrial district of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.** The station was a squat, brick building, its facade stained with years of soot and grime â€“ a testament to its dedication. A towering steel sculpture of intertwined serpents, hence the nickname, guarded the entrance, a symbol of the station's strength and resilience. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of diesel, coffee, and the faint, ever-present aroma of burned rubber and ash. The station was a chaotic symphony of functional spaces: a large, open bay housing two gleaming red engines and a ladder truck, a communal kitchen perpetually brewing strong, dark coffee, a weight room where firefighters honed their physical strength, and a dorm-like sleeping area with rows of metal-framed beds. Maps of the city, crisscrossed with colored pins denoting hydrant locations and hazardous zones, adorned the walls, a constant reminder of the lives depending on them. It was a haven of controlled chaos, a brotherhood forged in flames, and Ava Dubois' home away from home.
