Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a story with an author as the main character:

**Setting:** A sprawling, rambling Victorian house nestled on the windswept coast of Cornwall, England. It's late October. The sky is a perpetual bruised gray, and the air smells of salt and damp earth. Inside, the house is a warren of cluttered rooms, overflowing bookshelves, and the faint, lingering scent of pipe tobacco and old paper.

**Opening:**

The skeletal fingers of the late afternoon sun clawed through the grimy windows of the study, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air like tiny, restless spirits. Eleanor Ainsworth, perched precariously on a worn leather armchair that had seen better days, chewed on the end of her pen, her brow furrowed in concentration. The rhythmic crash of the waves against the jagged cliffs below was a constant, almost hypnotic drone, yet it did little to soothe the writer's block that had been plaguing her for weeks.

Eleanor sighed, the sound lost in the cacophony of the wind howling outside. Another page, blank except for the title scrawled at the top: "The Serpent's Kiss." A promising title, she thought grimly, but promises, like the Cornish weather, were often broken. She had a deadline looming, a publisher breathing down her neck, and a story that refused to be written. Perhaps the sea would offer some inspiration, or perhaps it would merely mock her with its vast indifference. Only time, she supposed, would tell.
