The morning dew clung to the emerald blades of Kentucky bluegrass, beading like a thousand tiny jewels. It was a perfect, crisp October morning – the kind where the air smelled of damp earth and the promise of pumpkin spice lattes. A single robin, plump and proud, hopped across the immaculately manicured lawn, its beak twitching as it hunted for an early worm. This was, undoubtedly, Mrs. Abernathy's favorite view, and thus, the pressure was on.

This was the setting: the sprawling, perfectly maintained gardens of the Abernathy estate in the affluent suburb of Oakwood Heights, Connecticut. The house, a behemoth of gray stone and sprawling gables, stood sentinel on a small hill, overlooking a meticulously sculpted landscape. Rose bushes, pruned to the nth degree, lined the driveway. Japanese maples, ablaze with fiery color, guarded the patio. And sculpted hedges, resembling everything from whimsical animals to geometric shapes, dotted the landscape.

And this was where Ferdinand Bartholomew "Bart" Finch, landscaper extraordinaire, found himself, perched precariously on a ladder with a pair of specialized topiary shears. Sweat beaded on his brow despite the chill in the air. He was wrestling with Mrs. Abernathy's prize-winning poodle hedge, specifically the poodle's rather disproportionate rear end. Today was the day of the Oakwood Heights Garden Club’s annual fall tour, and Bart was determined to ensure every blade of grass, every leaf, and every poodle's behind was in perfect order. He just hoped he could finish before Mrs. Abernathy, notorious for her exacting standards and hawk-like vision, spotted the minuscule imperfection he was currently battling.
