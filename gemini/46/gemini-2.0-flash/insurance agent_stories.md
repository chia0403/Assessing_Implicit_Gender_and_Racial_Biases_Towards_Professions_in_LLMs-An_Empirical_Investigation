The rain lashed against the windows of his dented Ford Taurus, mimicking the relentless drumming in Edgar Alistair Finch's temples. He wasn't built for this kind of weather, this kind of job, or frankly, this kind of town. Quinton’s Crossing, nestled deep within the Appalachian Mountains, was the kind of place where gossip travelled faster than electricity, and suspicion clung to outsiders like the damp mist swirling through the hollows.

Edgar, a man more comfortable crunching numbers in a sterile office environment, found himself parked on a muddy verge outside a ramshackle farmhouse. The paint was peeling, revealing patches of grey wood beneath, and the porch sagged precariously. A rusted swing set creaked rhythmically in the wind, a lonely, dissonant chime against the storm's fury. He was here to assess the damage caused by a rogue pine tree that had, according to the claim form, decided to "take a notion" and fall directly onto Mrs. Elvira Peabody's roof. Edgar suspected the "notion" had more to do with years of neglect and a hefty dose of rot, but he’d learned long ago to keep his opinions to himself, especially when dealing with the residents of Quinton’s Crossing. He took a deep breath, adjusted his tie (a vibrant paisley print that felt particularly out of place), and braced himself. This was going to be a long day.
