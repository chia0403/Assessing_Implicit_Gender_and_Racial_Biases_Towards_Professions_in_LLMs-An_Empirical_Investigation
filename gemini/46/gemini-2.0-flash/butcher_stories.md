## Story Opening:

The smell of sawdust, blood, and rosemary hung heavy in the air, clinging to everything in the shop like a stubborn lover. Bartholomew "Bart" Finnigan inhaled deeply, the familiar aroma a comfort against the gnawing anxiety that had taken root in his belly since sunrise. Sunlight, thin and watery like weak broth, slanted through the window, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the air and the faint, spiderweb cracks etched into the enamel of the scales. He sharpened his cleaver, the rhythmic *shing, shing, shing* a counterpoint to the early morning silence. It was just past six, and the pre-dawn stillness of Market Street was about to be shattered. Bart knew it. He could feel it in the tremor of his hand as he tested the cleaver's edge against his thumb. Today was different. Today, something was coming.

## Setting:

Finnigan's Fine Meats stood on a corner of Market Street in the small, coastal town of Havenwood, Maine. The building itself was a squat, two-story structure, painted a faded, almost sickly green. The paint peeled in ragged strips, revealing patches of weathered grey wood beneath. Above the door, a hand-painted sign, almost obscured by years of salty air and coastal fog, proclaimed the shop's name in elegant, albeit slightly chipped, lettering. Inside, the shop was a testament to tradition. Whitewashed walls showcased rows of gleaming stainless steel hooks, usually laden with cuts of beef, pork, and lamb. A long, sturdy butcher's block dominated the center of the room, scarred and stained with generations of work. The floor was covered in a thick layer of sawdust, meticulously swept each evening but quickly accumulating anew each morning. Behind the counter, a refrigerated display case hummed with a low, constant thrum, preserving the day's selections. The air was always cool, bordering on frigid, a necessary evil to maintain the freshness of the meat. In the back room, a larger, walk-in freezer provided refuge for the larger cuts and the day's deliveries. The entire space, while functional and well-maintained, possessed a certain old-world charm, a tangible link to the generations of Finnigans who had stood behind that block, wielding cleavers and serving the community of Havenwood.
