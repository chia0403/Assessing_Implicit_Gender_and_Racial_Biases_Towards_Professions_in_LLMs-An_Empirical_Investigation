## Story Opening:

The rain was a cold, insistent drumbeat against the corrugated iron roof of my office, a rhythm that perfectly mirrored the relentless ache behind my eyes. My phone, a vintage rotary model that was more reliable than any of these newfangled contraptions, buzzed for the fifth time in as many minutes. I ignored it. The damn thing sounded like a trapped hornet desperate to escape.

I took another long pull from my lukewarm coffee, the bitter taste doing little to clear the fog in my brain. The case I’d just wrapped up had left a bad taste in my mouth, not to mention a bruise on my ribs courtesy of a disgruntled bookie named “Lefty.” Business had been slow lately, the kind of slow that gnawed at your gut and made you consider taking on cases you normally wouldn't touch.

Finally, with a sigh that seemed to carry the weight of the city itself, I picked up the receiver. “Okay, okay. This is a bad time, but I’m here. Speak.”

A hesitant voice, laced with an almost theatrical nervousness, crackled through the line. “Mr. Beaumont? Is this Mr. Ezekiel Beaumont?”

I leaned back in my creaky chair, the leather sighing in protest. "You found the right place. What can I do for you, friend?”

## Setting:

Ezekiel Beaumont’s office was a dimly lit, cramped affair located on the third floor of a pre-war building in the less-than-glamorous district of Old Harbor, Boston. The building itself was a testament to a bygone era of industry and grit, with peeling paint, exposed brick, and the lingering scent of stale beer and forgotten dreams.

Inside, Ezekiel’s space was a reflection of his own weary but enduring spirit. The room was dominated by a heavy oak desk, scarred and worn from years of use. Piles of files, newspapers, and half-eaten sandwiches threatened to spill onto the floor. A single, bare bulb cast harsh shadows, highlighting the dust motes dancing in the air.

On the walls hung a haphazard collection of framed photographs: shots of crime scenes, faded portraits of past clients, and a single, carefully preserved image of Ezekiel in his younger days, before the city’s darkness had begun to etch itself onto his face. A half-empty bottle of rye whiskey sat on a shelf alongside a collection of well-worn paperbacks, mostly hard-boiled detective stories, providing a meager attempt at distraction from the grim realities he faced day in and day out. The overall effect was one of comfortable chaos, a haven for a man who had seen too much and knew better than to expect too much.
