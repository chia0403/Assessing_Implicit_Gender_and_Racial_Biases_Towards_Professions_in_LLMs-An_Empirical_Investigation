Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a highway worker:

**Setting:**

The Nevada sun beat down mercilessly on the cracked asphalt of State Route 375, a stretch of highway better known as the Extraterrestrial Highway. Mirages shimmered in the distance, blurring the already desolate landscape of scrub brush and jagged, rust-colored mountains. The air, usually still as death, was today disrupted by a swirling dust devil that danced across the desert floor, spitting grit against the reflective safety vests of the road crew. The time was almost 2:00 PM, peak heat for a job no one in their right mind would call comfortable. Patches of freshly laid tarmac steamed, adding a tarry tang to the already oppressive air.  A single beat-up Ford F-250, its paint faded to a ghostly white, sat parked on the shoulder, radio playing a static-laced country song.

**Opening:**

The rhythmic thwack of a sledgehammer against a metal stake was the only real music out there.  “Damn you, stubborn thing,” grumbled Franklin Delano Roosevelt Johnson, wiping a sheen of sweat from his brow with the back of a calloused hand.  His namesake was a far cry from a man slinging a ten-pound hammer in hundred-degree heat, but Franklin, or Frank as everyone called him, took a certain pride in his work.  Straight lines, perfectly angled signs, a job done right – that was his mantra, the tiny drop of order he could inject into this chaotic, unforgiving desert.  He adjusted his faded baseball cap, emblazoned with a faded "Nevada DOT" logo, and swung the hammer again.  *Thwack*.  He eyed the new "Caution: Unmarked Crossing" sign, positioned to warn drivers of the frequent (and often delusional) sightings of otherworldly creatures in the area. It still leaned a fraction too far to the right.  "Nope," he muttered, reaching for the hammer again. "Not good enough."

**A Few notes about the choices:**

*   **Setting Focus:** Emphasizes the harshness and isolation of the location. The "Extraterrestrial Highway" adds a layer of potential weirdness.
*   **Character Details:** Frank's full name creates immediate contrast and a bit of humor. His pride in doing a good job, even in a seemingly mundane task, reveals his character.
*   **Opening Action:** Starts with action and immerses the reader in Frank's work. The dialogue and internal monologue help establish his voice and perspective.
*   **Potential Conflict:** Hints at potential conflict, whether it's internal (his struggle for perfection) or external (the harsh environment, potential encounters with the strange).
