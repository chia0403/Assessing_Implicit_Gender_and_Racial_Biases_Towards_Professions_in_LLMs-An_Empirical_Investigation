**Opening:**

The insistent buzzing of her alarm pulled Amelia Grace Hawthorne from a restless dream populated by Pantone swatches and rogue leading. She slapped at the snooze button, a groan escaping her lips as the harsh morning light sliced through the gap in her blackout curtains. Another Monday. Another week of battling corporate logos and trying to inject creativity into quarterly reports. Amelia hated Mondays. She especially hated Monday when she knew her creative director, the perpetually-tanned and impossibly-named, Blaise Devereux, would demand she justify the “earthy yet contemporary” color palette she'd proposed for the new health food line.

**Setting:**

Amelia's studio apartment, perched above a bustling bakery in the heart of Philadelphia's Fishtown neighborhood, was a carefully curated haven of creative chaos. Exposed brick walls, whitewashed and adorned with framed prints by her artistic heroes – Saul Bass, Milton Glaser, Paula Scher – contrasted with the sleek, minimalist design of her workspace. A sprawling oak desk, salvaged from an old printing press, was littered with sketchbooks, half-empty coffee cups, and a chaotic jumble of colored pencils and markers. Sunlight streamed in through the large, industrial-style windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and casting a warm glow on the vibrant tapestry of her life. Despite the inherent disorder, there was a definite method to the madness, a visual language that spoke volumes about Amelia's artistic soul. Below, the enticing aroma of sourdough and cinnamon rolls wafted up from the bakery, a constant reminder of the tempting treats she really shouldn't indulge in before noon.
