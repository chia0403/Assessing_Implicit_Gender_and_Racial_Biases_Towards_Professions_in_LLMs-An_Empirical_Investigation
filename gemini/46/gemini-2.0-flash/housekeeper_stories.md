**Opening:**

The insistent shrill of the antique telephone shattered the morning stillness, jolting Eleanor Maeve Harrington from a dream where dust bunnies danced the tango. She groaned, pulling the floral-printed quilt tighter around her shoulders. Seven AM. Too early for anything good, especially on a Saturday. The phone, a relic from a bygone era installed by her eccentric employer, continued its relentless summons. With a sigh, Eleanor threw back the covers, the cool air prickling her skin. Whoever was on the other end of that line had better have a very good reason for disturbing her hard-earned rest.

**Setting:**

Eleanor Maeve Harrington lived in a small, surprisingly cozy cottage nestled at the edge of the sprawling estate belonging to Mr. Thaddeus Blackwood. The estate, named Blackwood Manor, was a gothic behemoth overlooking the choppy waters of the Atlantic Ocean in coastal Maine. The cottage, a far cry from the Manor's grandeur, was a welcome haven. It was crammed with her own mismatched furniture, hand-stitched embroidery, and overflowing bookshelves. A perpetually brewing pot of strong, dark coffee perfumed the air, battling with the faint scent of lavender from the sachets tucked into every drawer. The walls were painted a cheerful, albeit slightly faded, yellow, providing a stark contrast to the often-gloomy atmosphere of the Manor itself. Just outside her door, a small garden, bursting with unruly roses and fragrant herbs, provided a splash of color against the backdrop of the imposing forest that separated her from the main house. While she was employed as Mr. Blackwood's housekeeper, Eleanor often felt more like a reluctant guardian, tasked with keeping both the Manor and its owner from falling into irreversible disrepair.
