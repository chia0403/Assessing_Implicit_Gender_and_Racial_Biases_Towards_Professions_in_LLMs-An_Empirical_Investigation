## Opening and Setting:

The air hung thick and heavy, a damp, pre-storm miasma that made the sweat cling to Joseph “Joey” Mancini’s skin like a second, uncomfortable shirt. He wiped a forearm across his brow, smearing a line of grime across his forehead. The roar of the crane was momentarily drowned out by a thunderclap that rattled the corrugated iron of the temporary site office. Joey squinted up at the darkening sky. Not good. Not good at all.

The skyline of Providence, Rhode Island, was a jagged silhouette against the bruised purple of the approaching storm. Cranes like this one, towering steel sentinels, punctuated the cityscape, marking progress – or at least, the promise of it. Joey, a construction worker with calloused hands and a heart tougher than the rebar he routinely bent into place, felt the familiar rumble of anxiety in his gut. He’d seen storms like this one rip through the city before, leaving a trail of chaos and debris in their wake.

Joey stood on the skeletal frame of what would eventually be the new Providence Innovation Center, a gleaming glass and steel structure designed to revitalize the city’s tech sector. Right now, however, it was just a web of interconnected steel beams, open to the elements and potentially lethal in high winds. His crew, a motley collection of guys he’d known for years, was scrambling to secure loose materials, tying down tarps, and generally battening down the hatches. Joey scanned the site, his gaze lingering on the unfinished west wing, where a section of freshly poured concrete was still curing. He hoped to hell the rain held off long enough. A setback now could cost them weeks.

Another flash of lightning illuminated the site, painting the steel in stark, fleeting relief. Joey sighed, a puff of gritty air escaping his lips. This wasn’t just a job, it was his livelihood, his family’s future, and a piece of the city he loved. He had to make sure everything was secure. He had to make sure everyone was safe. He turned back to the task at hand, the rumble of thunder a constant reminder of the impending onslaught.
