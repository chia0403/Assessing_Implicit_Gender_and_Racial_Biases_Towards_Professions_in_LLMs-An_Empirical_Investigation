## Story Opening & Setting:

**Opening:**

The scent of ammonia and hairspray, a familiar and comforting cocktail to Eleanor Mae Davies, hung thick in the air. It was a scent she associated with possibility, with transformation, with the little jolts of joy she felt watching a client's face light up as they gazed at their new reflection. But today, the cocktail tasted bitter. Today, even the hum of the old-fashioned dryer and the chatter of the local radio station couldn't drown out the nagging throb in her temples. It was Tuesday, usually her busiest day, but the salon felt…hollow. Empty, save for Eleanor, stubbornly sweeping up a stray auburn curl that stubbornly clung to the linoleum like a desperate memory.

She sighed, the sound lost in the rustle of her floral-print smock. Maybe it was the weather. A sullen, slate-grey sky had been threatening rain all morning, mirroring the storm brewing inside her. Or maybe, just maybe, it was that cryptic postcard that had arrived yesterday, postmarked from a place she’d vowed to forget, a place that whispered secrets she’d rather keep buried.

**Setting:**

Eleanor Mae Davies owned and operated "The Curl Up and Dye," a small but well-loved hair salon nestled in the heart of Havenwood, a quaint coastal town in Maine. Havenwood was the kind of place where everyone knew everyone, where the lobster was always fresh, and where the rhythm of life was dictated by the tides. The salon itself was a cozy, slightly cluttered space, decorated with vintage posters of classic hairstyles and the occasional seashell art piece gifted by a grateful (and slightly eccentric) client. The walls were painted a cheerful robin's egg blue, and the worn wooden floorboards creaked a comforting tune underfoot. Three well-worn styling chairs faced large, ornate mirrors, each framed by strings of fairy lights that Eleanor had strung up years ago, adding a touch of whimsy to the otherwise practical space. Outside, a small hand-painted sign swung gently in the breeze, its cheerful lettering a beacon of hope for anyone seeking a little bit of beauty and a lot of friendly conversation.
