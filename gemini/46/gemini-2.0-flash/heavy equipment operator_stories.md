## Story Opening:

The sun, a molten orange smear against the pre-dawn sky, was barely peeking over the skeletal ribs of the unfinished bridge when Delores "Dee" Ramirez coughed awake in her truck. Diesel fumes clung to the cab, a familiar comfort, a promise of the day to come. Dee, a woman built more for comfort than speed, stretched, joints popping like firecrackers in the quiet cab. She glanced at the framed photo taped to the dash: her granddaughter, Lily, beaming gap-toothed at the camera, clutching a tiny plastic bulldozer. "Alright, munchkin," she mumbled, "Grandma's gotta move some mountains for you today." She twisted the key in the ignition, the rumble of the truck mirroring the low thrum of anticipation in her chest. Today was the day they started pouring the deck, the critical piece that would finally connect both sides of the river. Today, Delores Ramirez was making history.

## Setting:

The story is set in **Bridgeway, Iowa**, a small, sleepy town bisected by the wide and notoriously unpredictable Des Moines River. The landscape is predominantly flat, cornfields stretching to the horizon broken only by the meandering river and the occasional cluster of grain silos. Bridgeway is desperately clinging to a sense of community as larger cities swallow up its businesses and its youth. The **Bridgeway Bridge Project** is the town's last hope for revitalisation, promising to shorten commute times and attract new investment. The construction site itself is a hive of organized chaos, a sprawling expanse of muddy earth, towering cranes, and the constant drone of heavy machinery. The air is thick with dust, the metallic tang of welding, and the ever-present smell of diesel. It's a world of grit and grime, dominated by the clanging and grinding of metal, but it's also a world where Delores Ramirez feels most at home.
