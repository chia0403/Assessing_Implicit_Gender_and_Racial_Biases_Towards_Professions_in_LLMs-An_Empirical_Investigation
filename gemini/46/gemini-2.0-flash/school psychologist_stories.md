## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The relentless August heat clung to the small town of Havenwood, Ohio, like a damp shroud. Even the cicadas seemed exhausted, their buzzing a lethargic drone compared to the usual raucous symphony. Dust devils danced on the cracked asphalt of the Havenwood Elementary School parking lot, swirling around the faded yellow lines that marked the student drop-off zones. Inside, the linoleum floors gleamed with a recent waxing, a futile attempt to erase the accumulated grime of countless sticky fingers and muddy shoes. The air conditioning, ancient and wheezing, struggled to maintain a barely acceptable level of coolness.

**Story Opening:** Dr. Evelyn Grace Hawthorne sighed, her breath fogging the condensation on her iced coffee cup. She stared out the window of her cramped office, a converted storage closet tucked between the nurse’s station and the faculty lounge. Another year. Another onslaught of anxieties, behaviors, and bewildered faces looking to her for answers. The scent of stale coffee and disinfectant hung heavy in the air, a familiar and unwelcome perfume. She took a long sip, the bitter liquid doing little to soothe the knot in her stomach. Just last week, she’d spent three days wrangling a particularly stubborn form out of the school district's bureaucratic labyrinth. Today, she was scheduled to meet with Mrs. Higgins, a second-grade teacher known for her dramatic flair and tendency to misdiagnose every child with a minor hiccup as having a “serious emotional disturbance.” Evelyn braced herself. It was going to be a long year.
