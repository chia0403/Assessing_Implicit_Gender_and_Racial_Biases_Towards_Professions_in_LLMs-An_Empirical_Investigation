Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a nutritionist named Annelise Dubois:

**Setting:** A bustling, sun-drenched farmers market in the heart of Santa Monica, California. Stands overflow with vibrant produce: ruby-red tomatoes, emerald green kale, sunshine-yellow corn, and a kaleidoscope of berries. The air is thick with the mingled scents of freshly baked bread, brewing coffee, and the earthy aroma of just-harvested vegetables. Seagulls cry overhead, their calls almost drowned out by the cheerful chatter of shoppers and vendors.

**Opening:**

Annelise Dubois, her dark hair pulled back in a practical ponytail and her eyes crinkling at the corners from the relentless California sun, sighed with satisfaction as she surveyed the scene. The Santa Monica Farmers Market, her happy place, was in full swing. As a nutritionist with her own private practice, "Nourish Within," Annelise found inspiration and a profound sense of connection here. She loved the energy, the vibrant colors, and most of all, the tangible evidence of healthy, sustainable living.

This morning, however, her tranquility was about to be disrupted. A frantic call from a new client, a notoriously picky celebrity chef named Julian Thorne, had pulled her away from her usual Saturday morning ritual of scouting for the week's best ingredients. Heâ€™d screamed, she distinctly recalled, something about a disastrous catering event and a near-riot fueled by under-ripe avocados. Annelise gripped her reusable tote bag a little tighter, bracing herself for the culinary chaos to come. She just hoped she could salvage the chef's reputation, and maybe, just maybe, instill a bit of common sense along the way.
