## Story Opening:

The scent of antiseptic hung thick in the air, a familiar perfume to Eleanor Mae Bellweather. She scrubbed her hands one final time, the rough paper towel momentarily catching on the dry patch beside her wedding ring. Outside, the November rain lashed against the grimy windows of the Urgent Care, mirroring the grey anxiety that had settled in her chest. Tonight was going to be one of those nights. She could feel it. The kind where the waiting room filled with coughing children, stressed-out parents, and the lingering fear of something worse than the flu.

## Setting:

The story takes place in the **"St. Jude's Urgent Care,"** a perpetually understaffed and slightly dilapidated clinic located in the working-class neighborhood of **Millwood, a suburb just outside of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.** The lighting is fluorescent and harsh, casting a sickly pallor on the waiting room filled with mismatched plastic chairs. The walls are a pale, institutional green, decorated with outdated posters on hand-washing techniques and the importance of regular check-ups. The examination rooms are cramped and smell faintly of stale coffee and fear. Outside, the perpetually overcast sky adds to the feeling of dreariness and urban decay that permeates Millwood. The year is 2023.
