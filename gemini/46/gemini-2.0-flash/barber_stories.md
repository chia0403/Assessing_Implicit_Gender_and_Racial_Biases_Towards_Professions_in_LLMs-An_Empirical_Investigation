## Story Opening:

The humid Charleston air hung thick and sweet, a cloying perfume of jasmine and pluff mud that clung to everything, including the crisp white coat of Bartholomew "Bart" Finch. He sighed, wiping a bead of sweat from his brow with the back of his hand. Outside, the rhythmic clip-clop of horse-drawn carriages blended with the cacophony of gulls crying overhead, a familiar soundtrack to his morning ritual. Bart watched, a flicker of worry etching itself onto his already deeply lined face, as a gathering crowd began to form across the cobblestone street. A shiver traced its way down his spine, a primal unease he couldn't shake. Heâ€™d seen crowds like this before, always heralding trouble, and trouble was the last thing Bartholomew "Bart" Finch needed.

## Setting:

**Bart's Barbery, 1857 Charleston, South Carolina.**

The shop was a small, meticulously kept space nestled on a side street just off King Street. The air inside, though still warm, was slightly cooler than the oppressive heat outside, thanks to the thick stone walls of the building. A single oscillating fan, powered by a complicated system of pulleys connected to a water wheel in the back, churned the air lazily.

Sunlight streamed through the large, paned window at the front, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the air. The window display, carefully arranged by Bart himself, featured gleaming shaving mugs, polished straight razors, and a colourful array of imported hair tonics.

Inside, two worn leather barber chairs faced large, ornate mirrors that reflected the room back on itself, creating an illusion of greater space. A collection of well-thumbed newspapers, dog-eared books, and political pamphlets were stacked neatly on a small table near the waiting area. The walls were painted a soothing shade of pale blue, and a framed print of a clipper ship slicing through rough seas hung above the washbasin.

The shop smelled strongly of lavender shaving soap, bay rum aftershave, and the faint, comforting aroma of wood polish. It was a sanctuary, a place of quiet conversation and careful craftsmanship, a refuge from the bustling, and often turbulent, world outside. A refuge that Bart feared was about to be shattered.
