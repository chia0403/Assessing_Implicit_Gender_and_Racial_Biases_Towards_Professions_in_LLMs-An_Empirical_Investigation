## Story Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

The air inside the interrogation room hung thick and stale, a miasma of cheap coffee, desperation, and the faint, lingering scent of fear. Dr. Eleanor Vivian Blake adjusted the lapel of her tweed jacket, a small, almost unconscious act of defiance against the unsettling quiet radiating from the man across the table. He hadn't spoken a word in the two hours she'd been observing him, hadn't even shifted in his seat. Just stared, unblinking, at the cold, grey wall opposite him. This was a new level of stonewalling, even for someone who'd spent a decade navigating the murky depths of the criminal mind. Eleanor took a slow, deliberate sip of her lukewarm coffee, the metallic tang doing little to cut through the tension. It was time to break the silence.

**Setting:**

The story is set in the bleak, industrial city of **Greyhaven, Washington**, known more for its logging industry and persistent drizzle than its vibrant culture. The specific scene in this opening takes place in a nondescript interrogation room within the **Greyhaven Police Department's Criminal Investigations Division**, located in a sprawling, concrete complex on the outskirts of the city. The room itself is spartan and utilitarian: a steel table bolted to the floor, two uncomfortable-looking chairs, a one-way mirror concealing the observation room beyond, and a single, harsh fluorescent light buzzing overhead. The walls are painted a drab, institutional grey, devoid of any decoration or personal touch. The overall atmosphere is one of calculated intimidation and sterile detachment, reflecting the grim realities of the crimes investigated within its walls.
