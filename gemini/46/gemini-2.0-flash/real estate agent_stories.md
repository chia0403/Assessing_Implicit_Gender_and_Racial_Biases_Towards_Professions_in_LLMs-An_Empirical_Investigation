The persistent hum of the air conditioner did little to combat the August heat radiating off the asphalt of Coral Gables. Penelope "Penny" Ainsworth wiped a bead of sweat from her brow, the Florida humidity already attacking her perfectly coiffed blonde bob. She smoothed down the lapel of her crisp, cream-colored blazer, hoping she still looked professional despite the weather’s best efforts.

Penny adjusted the 'For Sale' sign in front of the Mediterranean-style villa, making sure it was perfectly aligned. This was 78 Ocean Breeze Drive, and it was going to be hers. Not literally, of course. Penelope Ainsworth, top-producing real estate agent for "Sunshine State Properties," was determined to sell this particular slice of paradise and add another dazzling commission to her growing bank account.

The property itself was stunning: terracotta roof tiles, a bougainvillea-draped courtyard, and a promised ocean view from the master suite balcony. Inside, the house boasted high ceilings, marble floors, and a chef's kitchen worthy of its own reality show. The former owners, a retired couple who had moved back north to be closer to their grandchildren, had meticulously maintained the property, leaving Penny with a practically turn-key sale.

The only problem? The persistent, unnerving feeling that something was… off. A subtle unease that prickled at the back of Penny’s neck, a feeling she couldn't quite shake. Maybe it was just the summer heat playing tricks on her. Or maybe, just maybe, this dream house had a secret it wasn't willing to give up easily.
