The rain was coming down sideways, propelled by a gust of wind that rattled the plate-glass window of "Wanderlust & Wayfarer Travel," and Penelope Aurora Dubois sighed dramatically, blowing a stray auburn curl off her forehead. Not exactly the kind of weather that inspired spontaneous trips to sunny beaches. But then again, business had been slow for Penelope since the advent of those infernal "do-it-yourself" travel websites. People seemed to think they could orchestrate a five-star vacation with nothing but a credit card and a dodgy internet connection. Penelope knew better. She'd spent the last fifteen years rescuing honeymooners stranded in flea-bitten motels and diverting cruise ships from impending hurricanes. She was a travel architect, a vacation virtuoso, and damn it, people should respect her expertise!

The setting: Wanderlust & Wayfarer Travel, a small, slightly dusty storefront squeezed between a perpetually boarded-up tattoo parlor and a bakery that smelled overwhelmingly of day-old donuts, was Penelope's domain. Located in the slightly-down-on-its-luck neighborhood of South Riverdale in the city of Ashwood, it was a kaleidoscope of faded travel posters: the Eiffel Tower shimmering under a romantic sunset, the turquoise waters of Bora Bora beckoning, a majestic lion roaming the Serengeti. These were relics of a bygone era, when travel was an adventure, not a commodity. Penelope's desk, a behemoth of mahogany and organized chaos, was littered with brochures, half-eaten granola bars, and sticky notes reminding her to "Book Mrs. Henderson's cat-sitter" and "Find a good llama trek for the Peterson twins." The air hung thick with the scent of old paper and a faint, lingering fragrance of sunscreen â€“ a subconscious attempt, Penelope admitted, to will herself onto a beach somewhere far, far away.
