Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a physical therapist as the main character:

**Opening and Setting:**

The biting wind, smelling of salt and decay, whipped off the choppy waters of the Atlantic, stinging Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Ainsworth's cheeks. She huddled deeper into her worn, navy blue peacoat, pulling the collar higher around her neck. The parking lot of the Sea Breeze Rehabilitation Clinic, a faded turquoise building perched precariously on the edge of Port Blossom, Maine, was almost deserted. It was a Tuesday evening in late November, the kind of night where the only sane people were huddled around crackling fireplaces, not navigating icy sidewalks.

Ellie glanced at the neon sign above the clinic's entrance, the "R" in "Rehabilitation" flickering erratically. She'd been the sole physical therapist here for the last five years, inheriting the practice from old Dr. Peabody when he finally succumbed to a lifetime of fried clams and stubborn optimism. Port Blossom was a town clinging to the past, its economy dependent on the dwindling lobster population and the occasional influx of summer tourists who were long gone now. The locals were a hardy bunch, stubborn and suspicious of outsiders, but once you earned their trust, they were fiercely loyal. And Ellie had earned their trust, one agonizing muscle strain and post-surgical limp at a time. She straightened her shoulders, a wave of exhaustion momentarily eclipsing her determination. Tonight, she was staying late to prepare for a new patient, a young woman with a story as stormy as the sea churning just beyond the clinic walls. The thought sent a familiar knot of anxiety twisting in her stomach. Some stories were harder to heal than others.
