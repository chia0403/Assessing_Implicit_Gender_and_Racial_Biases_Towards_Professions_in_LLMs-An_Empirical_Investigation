The late afternoon sun, thick and orange like overripe apricots, painted Silas Bartholomew’s weathered face a similar hue. He squinted, pushing his calloused fingers deeper into the dry, cracked earth of his potato field. The air hung heavy, thick with the scent of dust and the faint, lingering aroma of diesel from his aging tractor.

Silas’s farm, affectionately (and ironically) nicknamed "Prosperity Acres" by his long-departed grandfather, was a patchwork of struggling fields tucked into the lee of the whispering hills that marked the edge of the Appalachian Mountains. For generations, the Bartholomews had eked out a living here, battling fickle weather, hungry pests, and the slow, inexorable creep of urban sprawl that was swallowing the surrounding farmland whole.

But this year felt different. This year felt… ominous.
