## Story Opening and Setting:

**Story Opening:**

Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Ainsworth stared at the skeletal hand hovering precariously over the plate of glazed donuts, its phalanges practically radiating an aura of sugary desperation. She knew she shouldnâ€™t interfere, but the twitch in the metatarsals practically screamed for intervention. "Gerald, are you *sure* you want to do that?" she asked, her voice laced with a mixture of amusement and professional concern. Gerald, her receptionist, shot her a look that could curdle milk.

"It's Friday, Ellie! Donut Friday! Live a little!" He snatched the Boston cream and practically inhaled it, chocolate glazing smeared around his mouth. Ellie sighed. She really needed to get better at compartmentalizing her professional diagnosis and her personal life. Even when that life involved a sugar-crazed receptionist threatening to develop a severe case of bursitis in his shoulder.

**Setting:**

The "Ainsworth Chiropractic & Wellness Center" was tucked away on the second floor of a refurbished brick building in the heart of the historic district of Harmony Creek, Pennsylvania. The practice boasted exposed brick walls softened by woven tapestries in earthy tones, and sunlight streamed through large, arched windows, illuminating the meticulously arranged succulents scattered throughout the waiting area. Instead of the sterile scent of rubbing alcohol, the air carried a subtle aroma of lavender and eucalyptus, intended to soothe the nervous system upon entry. The reception area was small, dominated by a sleek, modern desk made of reclaimed wood where Gerald, a whirlwind of energy and mismatched socks, usually held court. Beyond the reception, the clinic consisted of three treatment rooms, each designed to promote relaxation and healing, featuring comfortable adjusting tables, soft lighting, and calming artwork. A small, brightly lit consultation room at the end of the hall served as Ellie's sanctuary, filled with anatomical charts, motivational quotes, and an overflowing collection of books on holistic health.
