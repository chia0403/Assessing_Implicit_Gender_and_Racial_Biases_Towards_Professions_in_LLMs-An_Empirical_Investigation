The clatter of ice against glass was the only sound Clara Beatrice O’Connell found solace in anymore. It was a precise sound, a rhythmic counterpoint to the cacophony of woes she’d absorbed over the past decade slinging drinks at The Rusty Mug. The bar itself, nestled in the heart of the gritty port city of Port Blossom, was a veteran itself, a weathered brick building draped with string lights that offered a warm, if slightly deceitful, welcome to anyone brave enough to push through its heavy oak doors.

Port Blossom, a place perpetually clinging to the edge of oblivion, was a canvas painted with the hues of salty air, diesel fumes, and the faint, sickly sweet scent of the fish processing plant on the south docks. The Rusty Mug, with its peeling paint, sticky floors, and clientele who looked like they'd aged a century in a decade, was a microcosm of the city's decay and resilience. It was a place where sailors, dockworkers, and the occasional lost soul came to drown their sorrows, celebrate fleeting victories, or simply escape the relentless grip of the ocean and the city’s harsh realities.

Clara, with her perpetually tired eyes and the permanent ghost of a smile playing on her lips, knew every crack in the bar’s counter, every stain on the stained-glass windows. She knew the regulars' names, their drinks, and their sad, predictable stories. And tonight, as the fog rolled in thick and the wind howled like a banshee outside, she braced herself for another night of pouring solace into empty glasses and listening to the lamentations of the lost. The door creaked open, letting in a blast of frigid air and a figure cloaked in shadow, and Clara’s hand instinctively reached for the well-worn bottle of Jameson. Another night in Port Blossom was just beginning.
