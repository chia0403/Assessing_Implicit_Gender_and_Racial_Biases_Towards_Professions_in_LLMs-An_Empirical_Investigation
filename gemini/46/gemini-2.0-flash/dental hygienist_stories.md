Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a dental hygienist named Eleanor Rose Abernathy:

**Story Opening:**

The high-pitched whine of the Cavitron filled the tiny operatory, competing with the jaunty polka music leaking from Dr. Petrov's antiquated radio in the next room. Eleanor Rose Abernathy, meticulously scraping away a stubborn patch of calculus behind Mrs. Higgins’ lower left molars, barely registered either sound. She was a conductor in her own small orchestra of gleaming metal instruments, her focus narrowed to the battlefield of the human mouth.

"Nearly there, Mrs. Higgins," Eleanor murmured through her mask, the words muffled but reassuring. "Just a little more scaling, and we'll have these pearly whites sparkling."

Mrs. Higgins, a woman whose dentures often seemed to possess more personality than she did, mumbled something back that sounded suspiciously like, "Wonderful, dear. Just hurry."

Eleanor chuckled silently. Some days, she felt like she was extracting secrets from patients more than plaque. And today, the secrets were apparently in a rush to escape. As she flicked the water spray off and prepared to polish, the building seemed to rumble. The light fixture above swayed slightly.

"Earthquake?" Mrs. Higgins squeaked, her eyes widening behind her thick lenses.

Eleanor paused, her hand hovering over the polishing cup. She felt a familiar tightening in her chest. Not an earthquake. The building was too quiet, too subtle. Something felt…off.

"Stay right there, Mrs. Higgins," Eleanor said, her voice steady despite the sudden prickle of unease. "I'll just check."

She turned off the Cavitron, the sudden silence amplifying the polka music and the pounding of her own heart, and cautiously stepped out of the operatory.

**Setting:**

The story is set in a small, independently owned dental practice called "Petrov & Abernathy Dental" located in a slightly rundown, but charming, Victorian building in the historic district of Portland, Oregon. The office itself is a mix of old-world charm and necessary modern equipment. The waiting room features mismatched antique furniture, a slightly threadbare Persian rug, and walls painted a calming, albeit slightly faded, shade of sage green. Dr. Petrov, the owner, is a kind but eccentric elderly dentist who has been practicing for over fifty years. The practice is frequented by a diverse clientele, ranging from blue-collar workers to eccentric artists and wealthy retirees. The building has a slightly creaky and lived-in feel, adding to the overall atmosphere of cozy familiarity, which is about to be shattered.
