Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a dentist as the main character:

**Story Opening:**

The pre-dawn gloom of the dental practice was thick and still, broken only by the rhythmic *thwump* of Horace Abernathy's stress ball against the back of his hand. He sat hunched over his desk, the fluorescent lights casting a sickly, jaundiced glow across the meticulously organized rows of appointment cards. A half-eaten box of donuts sat forlornly beside a stack of research papers on the efficacy of various fluoride treatments. Horace hadn't touched one in hours. Not since he’d reread Mrs. Higgins’ note. "Root canal scheduled, 9 AM. Please be gentle, Dr. Abernathy. It's for the best *and last.*" The last part was underlined three times, in what looked suspiciously like lipstick. A shiver ran down Horace's spine that had nothing to do with the early morning chill and everything to do with the unshakeable feeling that today was not going to be a good day for teeth – or for him.

**Setting:**

Dr. Horace Abernathy’s dental practice, "Abernathy Dental Excellence," is located in the somewhat sleepy, definitely eccentric seaside town of Port Blossom, Maine.

*   **Exterior:** The practice is housed in a quaint, two-story Victorian building painted a cheerful (perhaps overly cheerful) shade of robin’s egg blue. A white picket fence surrounds a small, impeccably manicured garden filled with roses and hydrangeas. A slightly crooked sign swings gently in the breeze, proclaiming "Abernathy Dental Excellence - Your Smile, Our Passion!"
*   **Interior:** The waiting room attempts to be soothing with pastel walls, plush armchairs, and a bubbling fish tank containing a single, perpetually bored-looking goldfish. The air is heavily scented with a vaguely medicinal lavender air freshener. The dental operating rooms are, by contrast, meticulously sterile, filled with gleaming chrome instruments and the ever-present hum of dental machinery. A large window in each room overlooks the harbor, offering patients a scenic (though often anxiety-inducing) view of the bobbing fishing boats.
*   **Overall Atmosphere:** Port Blossom itself is a town clinging to its maritime past. It’s filled with antique shops, seafood restaurants, and a healthy dose of small-town gossip. The Abernathy Dental Excellence practice is seen as a fixture in the community, and Horace himself, despite his quiet demeanor, is a well-respected (and occasionally feared) figure in the local social landscape. The town is charming and, generally, uneventful... until now.
