## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The harsh, biting wind whipped across the plains of Antelope Creek, Montana, a town clinging to the edge of the Little Rocky Mountains. Winter had arrived with a vengeance, blanketing the landscape in a thick, unforgiving layer of snow. The stark white was only broken by the occasional skeletal tree, stubbornly resisting the elements, and the muted browns of the weathered clapboard houses huddled together like shivering sheep. Inside the Antelope Creek Medical Clinic, the air was thick with the comforting scent of antiseptic and stale coffee, a desperate attempt to ward off the chill seeping in from the poorly insulated walls.

**Opening:**

Dr. Miller's gruff voice boomed from his office, rattling the already precarious stack of patient files on the counter. "Eliza! Eliza Jane O'Connell, where in the blazes are those lab results?"

Eliza stifled a groan and pushed a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. "Coming, Doctor," she called back, her voice laced with the patient weariness that only a small-town physician's assistant could truly understand. She carefully navigated the narrow hallway, dodging a precariously balanced blood pressure cuff stand and a stack of pamphlets on flu prevention. The clinic was a chaotic haven, a testament to the fact that in Antelope Creek, the human body rarely waited for convenience. She just hoped old Mrs. Henderson's glucose levels were better than the last time. Another diabetic emergency was the last thing Eliza needed on a day like today, when even breathing felt like an Olympic sport against the Montana wind.
