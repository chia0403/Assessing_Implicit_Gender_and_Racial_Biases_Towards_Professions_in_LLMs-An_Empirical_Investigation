## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, stinging Amelia Stone's cheeks as she hurried across the cobblestone plaza in Chicago's River North neighborhood. It was late November, the city already cloaked in a pre-Christmas chill and the threat of early snow. Wrought iron sculptures, slick with moisture, cast long, distorted shadows under the gas lamps. The cacophony of traffic, a symphony of horns and rumbling engines, echoed off the brick facades of the converted warehouses that now housed art galleries, swanky restaurants, and, Amelia's own modestly sized law firm.

**Opening:** Amelia Stone fumbled for her keys, her gloved fingers clumsy with cold. The lock to Stone & Davies, Attorneys at Law, stuck as usual, forcing her to jiggle the brass until she heard the satisfying click. She pushed the heavy oak door open, the scent of old paper, beeswax polish, and simmering resentment - courtesy of her partner, Robert Davies - washing over her. Inside, the single reception desk stood empty, a testament to her late arrival and the general state of understaffing. A single, flickering halogen lamp cast a pool of yellow light on the dusty Persian rug, doing little to alleviate the encroaching gloom. Amelia slammed the door shut against the wind, already anticipating the mountain of paperwork that awaited her, the ceaseless ringing of the phone, and the gnawing feeling that she was fighting a losing battle, one client, one billable hour at a time. Tonight, however, felt different. Tonight, the familiar anxieties were overshadowed by a prickling unease, a whisper in the back of her mind that told her something was terribly, irrevocably wrong.
