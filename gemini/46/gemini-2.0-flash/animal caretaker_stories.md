## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The air in the Prickly Pear Wildlife Sanctuary hung thick and heavy with the scent of sun-baked earth, creosote bush, and something vaguely unsettlingly like rotting meat. This wasnâ€™t unusual. The Sanctuary, nestled deep in the heart of the Arizona Sonoran Desert, was home to a diverse and often demanding collection of injured and rescued creatures. Scorpions scuttled beneath cracked rocks, Gila monsters sunned themselves on dusty trails, and the mournful cry of a coyote echoed across the desolate landscape, a constant reminder of the wildness contained within its barbed-wire perimeter.

**Story Opening:**

Cecilia "Cece" Rodriguez, a tangle of sun-bleached brown hair escaping her sweat-stained bandana, grunted as she wrestled a fifty-pound bag of kibble off the back of her battered pickup. Dust devils danced around her ankles, miniature tornadoes of red earth that seemed to mock her efforts. She hated kibble. Hated the way it smelled, hated the way it felt on her calloused hands. But the coyotes, the few that were too damaged to release back into the wild, needed to eat. And Cece, no matter how much she complained, was the one who fed them. Today, however, the weight felt heavier than usual, the air hotter, and the silence of the desert more oppressive. Cece glanced towards the dilapidated ramada, a rickety structure offering minimal shade, where Mrs. Henderson, the Sanctuary's elderly owner, usually sat monitoring the radio. But Mrs. Henderson wasn't there. And something about the unnatural stillness of the morning prickled the back of Cece's neck. This was the desert. Things were always happening, always struggling, always surviving. This...this felt wrong.
