## Story Opening:

The scent of burnt coffee mingled with the faintest whisper of lavender essential oil – a signature blend Agnes Beatrice Plumtree concocted to soothe the frayed nerves of both herself and her increasingly demanding clientele. Agnes pressed her fingers to her throbbing temples, the rhythmic pulse a counterpoint to the cacophony outside. Sirens wailed in the distance, a common serenade in this corner of Brooklyn, competing with the jackhammers assaulting the pavement a few blocks over. Agnes sighed, taking a shaky sip from her lukewarm mug. "Right," she murmured to the empty studio, "Time to wrangle some mid-century modern madness." Today's project: a bachelor pad for a tech mogul whose only design aesthetic seemed to be "expensive."

## Setting:

Agnes Beatrice Plumtree's studio, "Plumtree Interiors," was nestled on the ground floor of a renovated brownstone in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn. The space was a curated chaos, a testament to her eclectic style and slightly overwhelmed nature. Walls were painted a calming shade of dusty rose, but were almost completely obscured by mood boards overflowing with fabric swatches, paint chips, and magazine clippings. Shelves groaned under the weight of antique vases, vintage textiles, and meticulously categorized design books. A drafting table, usually covered in blueprints and renderings, was currently hosting a small mountain of paperwork – invoices, contracts, and increasingly aggressive emails from the aforementioned tech mogul's personal assistant. The air was thick with the aroma of lavender and the lingering ghost of that burnt coffee, a comforting, albeit slightly frantic, atmosphere that Agnes had painstakingly crafted over the past five years. Beyond the large, paned windows, the hustle and bustle of Smith Street offered a constant reminder of the relentless pace of city life, a pace Agnes was increasingly struggling to keep up with.
