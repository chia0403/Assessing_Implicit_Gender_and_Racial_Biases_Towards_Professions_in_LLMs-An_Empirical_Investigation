## Story Opening:

The relentless Memphis sun, a molten hammer beating against the tin roof, was enough to make even a seasoned roofer question his life choices. Especially a seasoned roofer like Arthur 'Art' Quentin Fitzwilliam, who, at 47, was starting to feel every single one of those years. He squinted, wiping a bead of sweat from his brow, the grit of the asphalt shingles sticking to his skin. Art cursed under his breath, the word lost in the rhythmic thump-thump-thumping of his hammer. Today, the heat wasn't just oppressive, it was mocking. It seemed to be personally challenging Art's ability to get the job done, taunting him with the shimmering heat haze that danced just above the horizon. He just needed to finish this last patch, secure the flashing around the chimney, and he could climb down, guzzle a gallon of sweet tea, and maybe, just maybe, convince Agnes to give him one of her famous back rubs.

## Setting:

The story takes place in the late summer heat of **Memphis, Tennessee**. Specifically, Art is working on the roof of a small, single-story bungalow in the **Cooper-Young Historic District**. The house is painted a faded shade of turquoise, with peeling white trim and a porch swing hanging crookedly. The neighborhood is a mix of renovated beauties and houses that are slowly surrendering to the ravages of time and neglect. The air is thick with the sounds of car horns, distant blues music drifting from a nearby record store, and the incessant buzzing of cicadas. The smell of honeysuckle and exhaust fumes hangs heavy in the humid air, a distinctly Southern cocktail. The houses are crammed close together, their tiny yards overflowing with mismatched furniture, rusty bicycles, and the occasional, stubbornly blooming hibiscus bush.
