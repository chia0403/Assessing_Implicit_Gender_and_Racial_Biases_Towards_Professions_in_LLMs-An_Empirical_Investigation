## Story Opening & Setting:

**Story Opening:**

Eleanor Vance tapped her stylus against the holographic blueprint projected above her desk, the rhythmic click echoing in the cavernous studio. Outside, Neo-Manhattan hummed with the frenetic energy of a million hovercars, a symphony of electric zips and automated announcements. But in here, in the sanctuary of Vance Architects, a controlled chaos reigned, fueled by caffeine, creativity, and the persistent hum of server blades running complex simulations. Eleanor sighed, pushing a stray strand of silver-streaked auburn hair behind her ear. This damn spire. It was meant to be her masterpiece, her legacy carved into the skyline, but it stubbornly refused to surrender to her vision. The client wanted audacious, the city demanded resilient, and Eleanor, driven by a lifetime of meticulous planning and a yearning for something truly beautiful, craved something more – something human.

**Setting:**

The year is 2077. Neo-Manhattan rises like a glittering, steel-and-glass leviathan from the reclaimed lands of what was once Lower Manhattan. Towering megastructures, interconnected by sky bridges and aerial tramways, pierce the perpetually overcast sky. Below, the grimy streets of the Lower Levels pulse with a different kind of life – a chaotic blend of humanity, technology, and desperation. Vance Architects, a prestigious firm, occupies the top ten floors of the "Elysium Tower" in Midtown. Their studios are a blend of sleek minimalism and advanced technology. Holographic projections dance in the air, robotic arms assist with model construction, and every surface gleams with polished chrome. The view from the panoramic windows offers a breathtaking, albeit slightly sterile, panorama of the futuristic cityscape.
