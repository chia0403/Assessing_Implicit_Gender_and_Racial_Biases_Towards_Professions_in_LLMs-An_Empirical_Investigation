The flickering fluorescent lights of "Stop & Shop" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the late-night shuffle of weary shoppers and the rhythmic beep-beep-beep of scanners. It was a Thursday night, nearly 11 PM, and the air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and wilting produce. Behind register number seven, Evelyn Magnolia Rose tapped a manicured nail against the Formica countertop, her gaze fixed on the digital clock. Just one more hour, she thought, just one more hour until she could peel off her sensible shoes, change out of her powder-blue uniform, and melt into the solace of her tiny apartment. Evelyn hated the late shift. It always attracted the dregs: bleary-eyed college students stocking up on ramen, disgruntled husbands sent on last-minute beer runs, and the occasional truly bizarre individual who insisted on paying for a single banana with a fistful of pennies. She sighed, a small, almost inaudible sound lost in the low thrum of the refrigerators. Tonight felt particularly long, drawn out like a slow-motion nightmare. The clock ticked forward another minute. Evelyn Magnolia Rose braced herself for whatever the next hour might bring.
