Okay, here's a story opening and setting, focusing on the tailor:

**Setting:**

The year is 1888. London is a city choked with coal smoke and teeming with life, a place where fortunes are made and lost with equal ferocity. Our focus is the East End, a warren of narrow, cobbled streets and grimy brick tenements. Here, amidst the clamor of costermongers hawking their wares, the rumble of horse-drawn carts, and the melancholic strains of a lone street musician's violin, sits "Stitch in Time," a small, unassuming tailor shop. Its window display is a modest affair: a perfectly tailored tweed jacket hangs alongside a bolt of rich, dark blue velvet. Inside, the air is thick with the comforting scent of beeswax, pressed cloth, and the faintest hint of lavender from a sachet tucked amongst the fabrics.

**Story Opening:**

The bell above the door of "Stitch in Time" jingled, its delicate chime swallowed almost immediately by the cacophony of Whitechapel High Street.  Augustus Finch, his thimble glinting under the gaslight, barely looked up from the intricate embroidery he was painstakingly applying to a duchess's riding habit. Duchess or no duchess, he wasn't about to risk pricking himself and ruining the delicate silk thread.  At forty-two, Augustus had spent the better part of his life coaxing elegance from cloth, and he approached each stitch with a meticulousness bordering on obsession.

"Just a moment," he called out, his voice a low rumble that still managed to cut through the street noise.  He completed the final tendril of the embroidered rose, clipped the thread with his miniature silver scissors, and finally raised his head. A figure stood silhouetted in the doorway, blocking the already meager light filtering in from the street. It was a man, tall and cloaked, and something about his posture sent a prickle of unease down Augustus's spine. Not the kind he felt when a client tried to haggle over the price of a bespoke suit, but something colder, deeper... more unsettling.

"Mr. Finch, I presume?" the man's voice was a low, gravelly whisper, like stones grinding together. "I believe you come highly recommended."
