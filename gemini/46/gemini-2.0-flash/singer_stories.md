Okay, here's a story opening and setting, with a main character who is a singer:

**Story Opening:**

The stale air of the Blue Moon Bar hung thick with the ghosts of cigarettes smoked and dreams deferred.  Dust motes danced in the lone spotlight illuminating the small, rickety stage.  It was nearly empty, save for a lone microphone stand and a worn, plush stool that had seen better decades.  Serenity threatened to turn into crippling nervousness as the seconds ticked by.  She adjusted the strap of her worn Gibson acoustic, its wood familiar and comforting beneath her fingers, and took a deep breath.  Tonight, it was just her and the echoes of a life she desperately wanted to change.

**Setting:**

The Blue Moon Bar was located on the outskirts of Ashwood, a small, forgotten town nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains.  The town itself was clinging to life, its main street a tapestry of boarded-up storefronts and faded paint. The Blue Moon was a relic of Ashwood's brief heyday, a once-bustling establishment that had slowly withered as the factories closed and the young people moved away.  Inside, the decor was a mix of vintage charm and neglect.  Faded velvet wallpaper peeled in the corners, revealing layers of past lives.  Old photographs of local musicians and forgotten celebrities adorned the walls, their smiles frozen in time.  The bar itself was a dark, varnished mahogany, scarred with rings from countless spilled drinks and etched with the initials of long-gone patrons.  The air perpetually smelled of stale beer and lost hope, a scent that clung to everything, from the threadbare carpet to the cracked vinyl booths. It was a place where secrets were whispered, dreams were drowned, and occasionally, if you were lucky, music was made.

**Main Character:**

**Eleanor Mae Harding**, a singer-songwriter with a voice that could both soothe and shatter.
