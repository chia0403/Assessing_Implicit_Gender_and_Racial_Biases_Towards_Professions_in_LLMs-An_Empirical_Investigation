The flickering fluorescent lights of Mrs. Eleanor Rose Hawthorne's kindergarten classroom buzzed with the frantic energy of twenty-three five-year-olds. Outside, the November wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the windows of Bright Beginnings Learning Center. Eleanor, her auburn hair pulled back into a practical bun, surveyed the scene with a practiced calm that belied the whirlwind inside her own head. Glitter, construction paper scraps, and the faint aroma of grape juice and Play-Doh hung heavy in the air. On the whiteboard, a lopsided turkey, lovingly crafted by little Timmy Miller, was barely clinging on, threatening to plummet into the chaos below. Today was the day before Thanksgiving break, and the excitement level had reached critical mass. Eleanor just hoped she could make it through the afternoon without someone accidentally gluing themselves to the floor.
