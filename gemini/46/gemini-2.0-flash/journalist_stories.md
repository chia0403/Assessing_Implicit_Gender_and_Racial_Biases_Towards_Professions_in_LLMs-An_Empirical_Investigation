The aroma of burnt coffee clung to the air, a familiar perfume in Beatrice Eleanor Davies' cramped office. Rain lashed against the windowpanes, blurring the neon glow of the "OPEN ALL NIGHT" diner across the street. Outside, Chicago was drowning. Inside, Beatrice was drowning in unanswered emails and half-eaten takeout containers.

It was 3:17 AM. The kind of hour where shadows lengthened and regrets sharpened. Beatrice, a tenacious investigative journalist for the Chicago Chronicle, hadn't slept a proper night in days. She was chasing a ghost, a rumor whispered in back alleys and coded emails: something about corrupt union officials siphoning millions from the city's infrastructure projects. A story that could make her career, or break it. The only lead she had worth a damn was a cryptic voicemail sheâ€™d received that evening, a muffled voice saying, "The lake remembers, Beatrice. Seek the Blue Heron. But beware, they feed on silence."
