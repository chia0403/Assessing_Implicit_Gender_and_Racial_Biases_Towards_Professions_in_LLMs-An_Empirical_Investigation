Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a flight attendant named Amelia Beatrice Thorne:

**Setting:** The galley of a Boeing 777, somewhere over the vast, inky expanse of the Atlantic Ocean. Fluorescent lights hum a monotonous drone, a counterpoint to the gentle rumble of the engines. Aluminum carts laden with duty-free liquor and snacks are neatly arranged. The air smells faintly of reheated chicken and industrial cleaner. A small window reveals only a star-dusted void.

**Opening:**

"Turbulence ahead," the captain's voice crackled over the intercom, barely audible above the drone of the engines. Amelia Beatrice Thorne sighed, pushing a stray auburn curl behind her ear. Turbulence. Just what she needed. She had finally managed to convince Mrs. Abernathy in 32B that the miniature bottle of Bailey's was *not* "expired," even though the date was smudged, and she was precariously close to a full bladder.

The warning light blinked on above the seatbelt sign, a sharp red eye in the sterile environment of the galley. Amelia glanced at her reflection in the polished metal of the coffee maker. Another ten hours to go on this London to Miami flight. Ten more hours of smiles, soothing words, and the increasingly desperate hope that she wouldn't have to deal with another "emotional support" peacock. Tonight, though, the thought wasn't a grim mantra. It was a shield, barely holding back the creeping unease that had been plaguing her since the moment the plane had lifted off the tarmac. It wasn't the turbulence; it was the feeling that something, somewhere on this metal tube hurtling through the darkness, was profoundlyâ€¦ off.
