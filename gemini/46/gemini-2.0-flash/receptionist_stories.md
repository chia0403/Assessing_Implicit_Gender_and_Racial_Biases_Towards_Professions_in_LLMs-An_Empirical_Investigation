The fluorescent lights hummed a relentless tune, a song Amelia Beatrice Higgins knew by heart. It was the anthem of the Sterling & Finch lobby, a space as meticulously curated as the orchids that graced the polished mahogany reception desk. Every morning, at precisely 8:15 AM, Amelia would take her seat, a perfect posture honed by years of ballet lessons that now seemed like a lifetime ago.

Sterling & Finch, Attorneys at Law, occupied the entire 47th floor of the Zenith Tower, a glass and steel monument to corporate power. The view, on a clear day, stretched all the way to the distant, hazy coastline, a shimmering promise of escape. But Amelia rarely looked. Her world was the lobby: the constant stream of impeccably dressed lawyers, the anxious clients clutching briefcases, the harried delivery drivers navigating the labyrinth of expensive furniture. This was her domain, and she ruled it with a quiet, almost imperceptible authority.
