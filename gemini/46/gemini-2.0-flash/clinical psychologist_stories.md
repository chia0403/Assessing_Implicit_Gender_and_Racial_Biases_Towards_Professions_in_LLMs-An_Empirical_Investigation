The incessant ticking of the grandfather clock in the waiting room was the only sound that seemed to cut through the stifling August humidity. Dr. Eleanor Vivian Holloway pressed a cool compress to the back of her neck, the scent of lavender and bergamot clinging faintly to the linen. Outside, the cicadas buzzed with a frenetic energy that mirrored the anxiety she often felt before a new patient.

Eleanor’s practice, “Holloway Psychological Services,” was housed in a converted Victorian house in the heart of Willow Creek, a quaint, postcard-perfect town nestled in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia. The house, a vibrant shade of periwinkle with crisp white trim, had been her grandmother’s, and Eleanor had meticulously restored it, hoping its inherent charm would ease the anxieties of those who walked through its doors. The waiting room was furnished with plush velvet armchairs in calming shades of teal and sage, arranged around a low coffee table laden with artfully arranged magazines and a bowl of polished river stones. Sunlight streamed through the stained-glass window depicting a bluebird in flight, casting kaleidoscopic patterns on the hardwood floor. It was an oasis of tranquility, designed to be the antithesis of the turmoil so many carried within.

Eleanor glanced at the clock again. 2:58 PM. Her first appointment with Mr. Silas Blackwood was in two minutes. She closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and mentally reviewed the brief intake notes she'd received. Silas Blackwood. Forty-two years old. Referred by his primary care physician for "persistent insomnia and generalized anxiety." That was all. The blank canvas of a new mind, waiting to be explored. Eleanor straightened her shoulders, adjusted her tortoiseshell glasses, and prepared to face the unknown.
