Okay, here's a story opening and setting, incorporating your request for a main character named as a hair cutter:

**Story Opening:**

The bell above the door of "Shear Delight" tinkled a cheerful, albeit slightly rusty, melody as Elara Finch, a woman whose own asymmetrical bob was a testament to her rebellious spirit, entered. Arthur Frederick Blackwood, the owner and sole proprietor of the establishment, barely glanced up from the ancient paperback copy of "Moby Dick" he was absorbed in. He knew the sound. Knew every sound, every creak and groan of the building like it was an extension of his own bones. He knew Elara came every three weeks, precisely, for a trim to keep her bold, fire-engine red hair from looking, as she so eloquently put it, "like a bloody bird's nest."

Arthur sighed, marking his page with a faded postcard of a clipper ship battling a monstrous wave. He loved the solitude and the slow rhythm of the salon, a sanctuary in the frenetic chaos of the city outside. But Elara was good for business, and he needed to replenish his dwindling supply of violet-scented hair tonic.

"Arthur," Elara chirped, draping herself dramatically onto the worn velvet chair in front of his station. "Darling, I swear, another week and I'd have to start wearing a net."

Arthur Frederick Blackwood managed a small smile. "Always a pleasure, Elara. Same as usual?"

**Setting:**

"Shear Delight" was a relic, a time capsule clinging to the fringes of a rapidly gentrifying Brooklyn neighborhood. Nestled between a trendy vegan bakery and a minimalist art gallery, its faded teal facade stood out like a defiant splash of color. Inside, the air was thick with the comforting aroma of lavender, rosewater, and a faint undercurrent of dust and antique wood.

The salon was small, dominated by two vintage barber chairs upholstered in cracked leather. Sunlight streamed through the grimy, lace-curtained windows, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the air. The walls were a gallery of decades past, plastered with yellowed posters of glamorous women sporting elaborate hairstyles, alongside framed certificates of Arthur's long-ago apprenticeship at a prestigious barber college. An ornate, mirrored back bar held an eclectic collection of hair products, antique shaving mugs, and curiosities â€“ a tarnished silver locket, a collection of smooth river stones, and a half-finished ship in a bottle. A chipped porcelain sink gurgled menacingly in the corner, and a skeletal rotary telephone, long disconnected, sat perched on a small, mahogany table laden with outdated magazines. The whole space had a feeling of well-loved neglect, a charmingly chaotic sanctuary from the outside world.
