Okay, here's a story opening and setting focusing on a drafting worker:

**Setting:**

The year is 1952. The air in the sprawling offices of "American Aeronautics & Engineering," in Wichita, Kansas, hums with the low thrum of ambition and the clatter of machinery. Rows of desks, each meticulously organized with T-squares, triangles, compasses, and blueprints rolled tight as cigars, stretch across the cavernous room. Natural light struggles to penetrate the grime-coated windows, supplemented by harsh, buzzing fluorescent tubes that cast long shadows across the drafting tables. The smell of ink, lead, and stale coffee permeates everything. This is the heart of the post-war dream, where men (and a handful of determined women) are designing the future of flight, one meticulously drawn line at a time.

**Story Opening:**

Mildred "Millie" Eleanor Carmichael adjusted her spectacles, the wire frames pinching the bridge of her nose. She’d been staring at the same damn wing strut schematic for the better part of three hours. The meticulous detail was almost hypnotic, the endless crosshatching a dizzying exercise in precision. Her wrist ached, the fine hairs on her forearm dusted with graphite.

A sharp cough shattered the silence. Millie glanced up to see Mr. Abernathy, her supervisor, a thin, perpetually anxious man with a comb-over that defied gravity and common sense, hovering near her desk.

"Carmichael," he said, his voice tight, "Are you *certain* these calculations are correct? We can't afford another... incident." He gestured vaguely, as if referring to some unspeakable horror committed by a previous drafting error.

Millie straightened her back, resisting the urge to roll her eyes. "Positive, Mr. Abernathy. I've checked them three times, and ran the calculations through the analog computer again this morning. These wing struts are designed to withstand a maximum stress load of…" She paused, remembering the exact figure. “…5,800 pounds per square inch, with a safety factor of 1.7.  Unless we’re planning on having the B-52 fly into the sun, they should hold just fine."

Abernathy didn't look entirely convinced, but he retreated with a nervous cough, leaving Millie to return to the intricate world of lines and angles. She loved the precision, the order, the quiet hum of creation. But sometimes, she couldn't help but wonder if there was more to life than just blueprints and calculations.  Especially when rumours started swirling about a secret new project, something that promised to break the sound barrier… and maybe even change the world.
