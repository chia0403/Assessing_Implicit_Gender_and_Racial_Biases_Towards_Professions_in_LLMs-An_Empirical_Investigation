## Story Opening:

The fluorescent hum above Theodore "Teddy" Bartholomew's head vibrated in time with the frantic hammering in his chest. He gripped the handle of his overflowing mop bucket a little tighter, its plastic rim digging into his calloused palm. The smell of industrial cleaner, usually a comfortingly mundane scent, now seemed to cling to the air like a suffocating shroud. He peered around the corner of the science wing, the squeak of his rubber-soled shoes a deafening proclamation in the otherwise silent hallway. Had he imagined it? A flickering light, a shadow that stretched too long, too thin? He swallowed, the lump in his throat tasting like fear. He was a janitor, not a ghost hunter. But damn it, Mrs. Hawthorneâ€™s prize-winning geraniums weren't being knocked over by rogue drafts. 

## Setting:

The story is set in **Hollow Creek High School**, a sprawling, brick-faced building nestled amongst the rolling hills of rural Pennsylvania. The school itself is a mix of antiquated architecture and modern additions. The original section, dating back to the 1930s, boasts ornate window frames, dark oak paneling, and echoing hallways that feel eerily quiet even during school hours. In stark contrast, the newer science wing, built in the late 90s, is all sterile white walls, glaring fluorescent lights, and the lingering odor of formaldehyde. 

Hollow Creek is a small, tight-knit community where everyone knows everyone else's business. The high school is the heart of the town, the venue for everything from Friday night football games to pancake breakfasts organized by the Future Farmers of America. It's a place steeped in history, both good and bad, a place where legends whisper in the shadows and the past has a habit of refusing to stay buried.
