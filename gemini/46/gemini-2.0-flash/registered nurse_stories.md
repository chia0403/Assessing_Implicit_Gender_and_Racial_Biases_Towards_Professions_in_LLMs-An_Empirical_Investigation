## Story Opening & Setting:

**Opening:**

The rhythmic beeping of the heart monitor was a lullaby, a stark counterpoint to the silent screaming in Evelyn Grace Mallory's head. Sheâ€™d heard that sound for so long, it was almost woven into the fabric of her being. Tonight, however, it felt like a ticking clock, counting down to something inevitable, something she desperately didn't want to witness again. She tightened her grip on the flimsy chart in her hand, the crisp paper crinkling in protest. *Mrs. Henderson, Room 312... DNR. End-stage renal failure.* Another one. Another soul about to slip away on her watch.

**Setting:**

The year is 2042. Evelyn Grace Mallory works as a registered nurse at **St. Jude's Memorial Hospital**, a sprawling, multi-storied complex that dominates the skyline of Neo-Baltimore. The city, once a bustling port, is now a patchwork of sleek, chrome towers and crumbling pre-Collapse infrastructure, reflecting the stark inequality that plagues the nation. St. Jude's itself attempts to bridge that divide, a publicly funded hospital striving to provide care for everyone from the cybernetically enhanced elite to the struggling inhabitants of the flooded lower wards. The ward where Evelyn works, **Geriatrics Intensive Care**, is a brightly lit, sterile environment filled with the latest medical technology, juxtaposed against the frail, aging bodies clinging to life within its walls. The air hums with the low thrum of ventilators and the constant murmur of weary nurses battling to keep the relentless tide of mortality at bay. Outside, the rain, a common occurrence in the perpetually overcast city, lashes against the panoramic windows, a somber soundtrack to the quiet drama unfolding within.
