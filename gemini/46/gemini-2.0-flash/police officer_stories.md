The acrid smell of burnt sugar hung thick in the air, a sickly-sweet counterpoint to the bitter coffee sloshing in Detective Sergeant Amelia Rose Holloway’s travel mug. She squinted, the pre-dawn light glinting off the grime-covered windows of the Blue Moon Diner. Rain, more sleet than rain, lashed against the glass, making the already blurry landscape outside even more indistinct.

Amelia hated stakeouts, especially stakeouts at the Blue Moon. The food was atrocious, the coffee even worse, and the pervasive smell clung to your clothes for days, a fragrant reminder of wasted hours spent watching nothing but the endless parade of trucks rumbling past on Highway 17.

Highway 17 was the artery that fed and bled the town of Havenwood, Georgia. Located nestled deep in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, Havenwood was a forgotten place, a town where time moved slower and secrets ran deeper than the mountain streams that crisscrossed the valley. It was the kind of place where everyone knew everyone, or at least thought they did, and where a new face raised immediate suspicion. It was also the kind of place where someone could disappear without a trace, swallowed whole by the dense forests and the tight-lipped community. And that was exactly what had happened to fifteen-year-old Lily Mae Abernathy two weeks ago.

Amelia Rose Holloway had been born and raised in Havenwood. She’d left, chased dreams of a bigger life in Atlanta, but like a homing pigeon, she’d eventually found her way back. Maybe it was the pull of family, maybe it was the familiarity, or maybe it was just the quiet comfort of knowing the rhythm of the seasons. Whatever the reason, she was back, a cop in the same town she’d vowed to escape, and now she was sitting in a greasy spoon diner, waiting for a ghost to appear.
