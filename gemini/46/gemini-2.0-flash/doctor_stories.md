## Story Opening:

The rhythmic pulse of the heart monitor was the only sound competing with the torrential downpour battering the corrugated iron roof of the clinic. Dr. Eleanor Vance, her face illuminated by the sickly green glow of the monitor and the dim kerosene lamp on her desk, rubbed the bridge of her nose. Sleep had been a luxury she hadn't indulged in for nearly 36 hours, not since the outbreak had taken hold. Outside, the humid air hung thick and heavy, pregnant with the stench of sickness and fear. She knew, with a certainty that settled like lead in her gut, that the worst was yet to come. The steady beep, beep, beep offered a small, fragile hope in the face of overwhelming despair. She just prayed it didn't stop.

## Setting:

The setting is a small, dilapidated clinic in the heart of the Amazon rainforest, specifically located in a remote, Indigenous community near the border of Brazil and Peru. The clinic is a single-room structure built primarily of salvaged wood and corrugated iron, offering minimal protection from the elements. The floor is packed earth, often damp and muddy. Medical supplies are scarce, and electricity is non-existent, relying instead on kerosene lamps for light. The surrounding jungle is lush and vibrant, yet teeming with unseen dangers - both natural and, increasingly, man-made, as encroaching logging and mining operations threaten the delicate balance of the ecosystem and the health of the community. The air is perpetually thick with humidity and the sounds of the jungle: the cries of exotic birds, the rustle of unseen creatures, and the ever-present drone of insects.
