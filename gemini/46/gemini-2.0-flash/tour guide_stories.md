The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of jasmine and diesel exhaust, a quintessential Bangkok cocktail that only the seasoned could truly appreciate. This was Suphaporn "Porn" Chaiyarat's Bangkok, a vibrant, chaotic, and utterly captivating metropolis she knew like the back of her hand. She leaned against the scarred fender of her brightly decorated tuk-tuk, "The Golden Gecko," watching as a knot of tourists, fresh off their long-haul flights, nervously surveyed the swirling chaos of Thanon Khao San Road.

Porn adjusted the flower garland adorning her neck, a splash of pink against the bright yellow of her "Amazing Thailand" tour guide polo shirt. She took a deep breath, the humidity clinging to her skin like a second layer of clothing. Another day, another gaggle of wide-eyed foreigners ready to be initiated into the secrets, tastes, and dizzying energy of the City of Angels. Today, she was determined to show them something beyond the well-trodden tourist traps. She was going to show them the *real* Bangkok, the one she loved.
