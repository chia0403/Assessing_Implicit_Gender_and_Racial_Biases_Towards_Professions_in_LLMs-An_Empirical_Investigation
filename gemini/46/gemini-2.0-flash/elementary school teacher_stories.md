The aroma of stale disinfectant and glitter glue hung heavy in the air, a scent Beatrice Eleanor Plum adored almost as much as the eager buzz of her third-grade class on a Monday morning. Room 2B, at Sunny Meadow Elementary, was a kaleidoscope of primary colours and slightly-off-kilter construction paper creations. Sunlight streamed through the large, south-facing windows, illuminating a mobile of paper mache planets hanging precariously above Beatrice’s head. Alphabet letters, each adorned with a child's drawing of an object starting with that letter (A for Apple, B for Bumblebee, C for Cat that looked suspiciously like a dog), snaked around the top of the whiteboard. It was a haven of organized chaos, a small kingdom ruled by imagination and the strict but loving hand of Miss Plum. And this morning, Beatrice Eleanor Plum was armed with a brand new book about a talking squirrel and a heart full of optimism, ready to tackle another week. Little did she know, the biggest lesson she’d be teaching wouldn’t come from any textbook.
