The scent of lavender and old paper hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma that belied the knot of anxiety tightening in Dr. Evelyn Ainsworth's stomach. She adjusted her reading glasses, the gold rims reflecting the pale morning light filtering through the dusty stained-glass window.

The setting was the "Ainsworth Institute for Nutritional Harmony," a sprawling Victorian manor perched on the windswept cliffs of Cornwall, England. It had been in her family for generations, initially a seaside sanatorium for the wealthy suffering from "nervous exhaustion," and later, under Evelyn’s grandfather, transformed into a pioneering research center focused on the connection between diet and mental wellbeing. Now, Evelyn, carrying on the family legacy, ran it as a retreat for individuals seeking a holistic approach to health.

The grand hall, where Evelyn now sat reviewing the latest research grant applications, was a testament to the Institute’s history. Dark wood panelling lined the walls, adorned with portraits of stern-faced Ainsworths who all seemed to glare down at her, silently judging her every decision. A massive fireplace, thankfully cold in the early June chill, dominated one wall, and opposite it, a winding staircase disappeared into the upper floors, rumored to be home to drafts, creaks, and perhaps, the lingering ghosts of past patients.

Evelyn sighed, pushing a stray strand of her auburn hair behind her ear. She loved the Institute, its history, and the work they did here, but today, the weight of maintaining her family's reputation, coupled with the ever-increasing financial pressures, felt particularly heavy. Just then, a loud knock echoed through the hall, shattering the quiet contemplation and signaling the start of another hectic day.
