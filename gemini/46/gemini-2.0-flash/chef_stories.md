The clatter of copper pots, usually a symphony in Antoine Dubois’s kitchen, sounded cacophonous and mocking this morning. Antoine, all six-foot-four of him crammed into the minuscule pantry, cursed softly under his breath. Flour dusted his already flour-covered apron, clinging to the perpetually damp curls that escaped his meticulously tied chef’s hat. He was out of truffle oil. *Again*.

Antoine, Executive Chef Antoine Dubois of "Le Coeur Volant," a tiny, fiercely authentic French bistro tucked away on a cobblestone alley in Montreal's Old Port, considered his options. He could send Pierre, his perpetually harried sous chef, on a frantic dash to the nearest specialty food store, but that would inevitably result in a panicked phone call an hour later about the cost and questionable provenance of said oil. Or he could improvise. *Sacré bleu,* he hated improvising with his signature truffle risotto. It had been his grandmother’s recipe, passed down through generations of Dubois chefs, and the idea of deviating from it felt like sacrilege.

Le Coeur Volant, nestled between a dusty antique shop and a boisterous pub, was a sliver of France stubbornly clinging to life in the heart of Canada. The restaurant itself was a study in controlled chaos. Its fifteen tables, draped in crisp white linen, were always full. The walls, painted a warm, buttery yellow, were adorned with vintage posters of the French Riviera. Sunlight streamed through the lace-curtained windows, illuminating the swirling steam rising from bubbling pots on the antique stove. The air, thick with the aroma of garlic, thyme, and melting butter, promised a taste of Parisian romance, even on a dreary Montreal morning. But right now, all Antoine could smell was the impending disaster of a truffle-less risotto. He emerged from the pantry, his face a thundercloud, ready to unleash his frustration on Pierre, when the bell above the door jingled, announcing the arrival of his first customer.
