## Story Opening & Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The ringing phone sliced through Thomas Ashton’s morning like a serrated knife. He knew before he answered, before the caller ID flashed on the screen, that it wouldn't be good news. Bad news always smelled like burnt toast and desperation, and hung heavy in the air of his corner office, even before the phone’s shrill cry ratified his premonition. Taking a deep breath, he picked up the receiver, pasting on a practiced, slightly too-bright smile that no one could see. “Ashton Capital, Thomas Ashton speaking. How can I help you?”

**Setting:**

Thomas Ashton's office, high on the 47th floor of the Sterling Building in downtown Manhattan. The view was breathtaking, a panoramic spread of the city that never slept, a concrete jungle teeming with ambition and broken dreams. On a clear day, you could almost see the Statue of Liberty, a distant green beacon of hope. But today, the sky was a dull, oppressive grey, mirroring the steel and glass that dominated the landscape. Inside, the office was a study in calculated success. Rich mahogany furniture, meticulously arranged, spoke of power and stability. Framed degrees from Wharton and Yale hung discreetly on the wall, whispering of academic prowess. The only real pops of color came from a vibrant abstract painting above the sleek, modern sofa, a bold statement piece that hinted at the maverick lurking beneath Thomas’s polished exterior. Despite the opulence, the air felt sterile, almost antiseptic. It was a place designed to impress, not to comfort, a reflection of the cutthroat world that Thomas navigated daily. The constant hum of the city, usually a comforting background noise, vibrated with an unsettling energy this morning. Something was about to break.
