The wind howled a mournful dirge against the corrugated iron of the hangar, mimicking the ache in Amelia "Amy" Beatrice Hawthorneâ€™s chest. Dawn was a smudge of bruised purple and grey on the horizon, barely illuminating the dusty expanse of the airfield. The air, thick with the smell of kerosene and damp earth, clung to her like a shroud.

The setting was the forgotten airstrip of Dust Devil Acres, nestled deep in the Oklahoma panhandle. It wasn't much, just a single gravel runway choked with weeds, a dilapidated hangar threatening to collapse under its own weight, and a weathered windsock that spun erratically in the relentless wind. It was the kind of place you went to disappear, a place where the silence was broken only by the rustle of the wind and the lonely cry of a hawk circling overhead. Amy had come here six months ago, running from the wreckage of her life and hoping to find some semblance of peace amongst the vast, empty plains. This place, and her vintage Stearman biplane, the "Prairie Rose," were all she had left.
