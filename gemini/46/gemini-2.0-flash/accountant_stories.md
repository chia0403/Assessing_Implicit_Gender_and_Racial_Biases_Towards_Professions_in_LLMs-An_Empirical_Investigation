## The Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights of the office hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to another Tuesday afternoon for Bartholomew "Barry" Finch. He stared at the spreadsheet on his monitor, the rows of numbers blurring together like a Jackson Pollock painting rendered in shades of grey. He'd been staring at it for three hours, trying to reconcile a discrepancy of precisely $17.43. Seventeen dollars and forty-three cents. It might as well have been seventeen million, the way it was currently plaguing his existence.

Barry sighed, the sound lost in the sterile air. He leaned back in his ergonomic chair, the mesh digging slightly into his already aching back. Outside, the Seattle rain was doing its best impression of a melancholic symphony, pattering against the windowpane. It was a city that thrived on coffee and introspection, and Barry, unfortunately, was currently overdosing on both.

He knew he should get up, stretch, maybe grab another cup of the lukewarm, vaguely metallic coffee that perpetually brewed in the breakroom. But the thought of leaving the relative safety of his cubicle, of facing the bustling energy of the accounting firm, felt like an insurmountable task. He was, in that moment, the embodiment of numerical inertia.

He was about to succumb to the siren call of a cat video on YouTube when his phone buzzed, the ringtone - a chirpy little rendition of "Money, Money, Money" by ABBA - cutting through the quiet despair of his office. He knew, instinctively, that whatever was on the other end of that line was not going to be good news. Especially considering who the caller ID identified: "Mrs. Eleanor Vanderslice, CEO."

## The Setting:

Barry Finch works at *Vanderslice & Partners*, a moderately successful accounting firm located in downtown Seattle. The office itself is on the 14th floor of a modern glass skyscraper, offering a panoramic view of Elliott Bay... a view that Barry rarely appreciated, too busy focusing on the minutiae of financial ledgers to notice the majesty of the Puget Sound.

The interior design is classic corporate: muted greys and blues, punctuated by the occasional potted plant struggling to survive under the fluorescent glow. The air conditioning is permanently set to "arctic," forcing most employees to wear sweaters or jackets year-round. The breakroom is small and utilitarian, equipped with a coffee maker that seems to be perpetually malfunctioning, a water cooler that sputters and gurgles, and a sad selection of stale vending machine snacks.

Barry's cubicle is a microcosm of his life: meticulously organized but undeniably beige. He has a picture of his cat, Mr. Whiskers, taped to the divider, a small potted succulent on his desk, and a collection of colorful Post-it notes covered in numbers and cryptic abbreviations. It's a safe, predictable space, a refuge from the complexities of the world - a world that is about to crash down around him with the force of a Seattle rainstorm.
