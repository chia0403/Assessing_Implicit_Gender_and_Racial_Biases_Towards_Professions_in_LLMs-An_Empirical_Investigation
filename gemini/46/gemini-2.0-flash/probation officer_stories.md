**Setting:** The crisp October air nipped at the corners of Sarah’s face as she stood outside the crumbling brick building that housed the Jackson County Probation Department. Sunlight, weak and watery, struggled to penetrate the grime clinging to the windows. The scent of stale coffee and disappointment hung heavy in the air, a perfume Sarah had become intimately familiar with over the past seven years. Across the street, a pawn shop blinked neon signs promising quick cash and escape, a siren song for many of the souls Sarah tried to guide back to shore. Inside, the fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the weary sighs and shuffling feet that characterized a typical Monday morning.

**Opening:** Sarah Michelle Walker, a probation officer with a soul perpetually teetering between optimism and despair, pulled the collar of her worn trench coat tighter against the morning chill. The weight of the case files in her oversized canvas bag felt heavier than usual, a physical manifestation of the struggles she knew awaited her within those grimy walls. Today was parole hearing day for Anthony “Razor” Rizzo, a hardened kid who’d gotten caught up in a drug trafficking ring far too young. Sarah had poured everything she had into him, trying to chip away at the hardened exterior and expose the vulnerable boy hidden underneath. But Rizzo, like so many others, was a puzzle with missing pieces, a life shattered before it even truly began. She just hoped she had enough glue to hold him together, or at least enough to convince the parole board he deserved another chance.
