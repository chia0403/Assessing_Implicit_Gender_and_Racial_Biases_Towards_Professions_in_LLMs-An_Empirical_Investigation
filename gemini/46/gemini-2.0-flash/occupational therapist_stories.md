The oppressive humidity clung to everything, a damp shroud that made even breathing feel like a chore. Sweat prickled under Dr. Eleanor Vivian Bellweather's hairline as she navigated the crowded parking lot of the Meadowbrook Rehabilitation Center, the Florida sun beating down on her with the force of a malevolent spotlight. Meadowbrook, a sprawling complex of pale yellow buildings connected by labyrinthine corridors, was nestled amongst palm trees and manicured lawns that did little to alleviate the sterile, institutional feel. It was a place of hope and heartbreak, of slow victories and crushing defeats.

Eleanor adjusted the strap of her well-worn tote bag, its overflowing contents threatening to spill at any moment - a half-eaten apple, a dog-eared copy of "The Body Keeps the Score," a tangle of resistance bands, and a kaleidoscope of brightly colored sensory balls. She took a deep breath, the scent of chlorine from the nearby therapy pool mixing with the faint, lingering odor of antiseptic. Another day, another chance to help someone reclaim a piece of their life. Today, that someone was Mr. Henderson, and Eleanor was determined to make it a good day for him, despite the relentless Florida heat and the inherent challenges that awaited them both within the walls of Meadowbrook.
