## The Opening

The scent of lilies and desperation clung to the lobby of the Grand Meridian Hotel like a persistent cough. Arthur Quentin Bellweather, his back aching a familiar protest from a long shift, surveyed the arriving horde with a weary resignation. It was Friday night, the apex of the weekend rush, and the Grand Meridian had become a temporary haven for a kaleidoscope of humanity: honeymooners giddy with champagne dreams, businessmen barking orders into their phones, and socialites dripping in jewels, all converging under its gilded dome. Tonight, Arthur wasn't just a bellhop; he was a gatekeeper, a silent observer to the fleeting dramas unfolding within the hotel's opulent walls. He straightened his crisp uniform, adjusting the perpetually slipping epaulettes, and forced a polite smile, even as Mrs. Vandergelt, dripping in enough diamonds to sink a small boat, summoned him with a shrill whistle and a wave that threatened to dislodge a chihuahua from its bejeweled carrier. "Bellweather! My Louis Vuitton collection needsâ€¦attention." Arthur sighed inwardly. This was going to be a long night.

## The Setting

The Grand Meridian Hotel stood as a monument to forgotten glamour in the heart of New Haven, Connecticut. Built in the roaring twenties, its Art Deco facade still shimmered with an almost defiant brilliance, a stark contrast to the modern glass and steel structures that sprouted around it. The lobby was a symphony of polished marble, plush velvet seating, and crystal chandeliers that cast a warm, inviting glow. A grand staircase swept upwards to the mezzanine, lined with framed portraits of dignitaries and socialites who had graced its halls over the decades. Hidden corridors snaked behind the scenes, leading to bustling kitchens, linen closets, and the cramped, utilitarian staff areas where Arthur and his colleagues found momentary respite. The air was thick with the murmur of conversations, the clinking of glasses, and the faint strains of jazz drifting from the hotel's renowned cocktail lounge, a constant reminder of the escapism and indulgence that the Grand Meridian promised its guests.
