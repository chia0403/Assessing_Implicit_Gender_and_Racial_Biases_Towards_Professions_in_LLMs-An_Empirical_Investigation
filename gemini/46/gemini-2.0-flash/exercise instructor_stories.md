Okay, here's a story opening, including the setting and the full name of the main character, who is an exercise instructor:

**Setting:** The humid, pre-dawn air of Miami Beach clings to everything, thick and salty. Palm trees rustle in the light breeze, their fronds silhouetted against the slowly lightening sky. The rhythmic crash of waves provides a constant, calming soundtrack. The Lummus Park Fitness Zone, a collection of outdoor exercise equipment scattered along Ocean Drive, is just starting to stir with life.

**Opening:**

"Alright, people, let's *move*!" called out Genevieve "Gigi" Rodriguez, her voice amplified by the small, portable microphone clipped to her waistband. The pink and orange hues of sunrise were just beginning to paint the sky as she bounced on the balls of her feet, her energy practically radiating off her like heat from the asphalt. A cluster of bleary-eyed tourists and determined locals, ranging from retirees to twenty-somethings in designer workout gear, shuffled into position before her, groaning softly. This was Gigi's domain – the 6 AM Body Blitz, a sunrise workout designed to shock the system and start the day with a jolt. She grinned, a flash of perfect white teeth against her sun-kissed skin. "Five more minutes of excuses and ten extra burpees! I’m watching you, Mr. Henderson!" She winked at a businessman in a ill-fitting tracksuit, causing him to sigh dramatically but straighten his back nonetheless. Today, like every day, Gigi was ready to sculpt some bodies and chase away the Miami malaise, one squat, one lunge, and one perfectly timed motivational yell at a time.
