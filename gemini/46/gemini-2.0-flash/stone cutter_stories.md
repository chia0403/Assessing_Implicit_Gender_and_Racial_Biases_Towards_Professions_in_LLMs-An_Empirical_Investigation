## Story Opening:

The rasp of steel against granite was the only sound louder than the relentless wind that clawed at the exposed crag. Elias Thorne, his face etched with the same lines and crevices that adorned the mountain itself, spat a wad of dust into the biting air. He paused, his gloved hand resting on the heavy chisel, and squinted at the block of stone before him. It was a stubborn piece, riddled with unforeseen faults that threatened to split under the slightest pressure.

Elias sighed, the sound lost in the windâ€™s howl. He'd been wrestling with this particular block for weeks, commissioned by the Baron himself for a gargoyle destined to perch atop the newly constructed north tower of Castle Ravenwood. The Baron expected perfection, as always. And Elias, as always, would deliver. Failure was not an option. Not when his family, nestled in the shadow of the mountain in the tiny village of Oakhaven, depended on his craft.

He readjusted his grip, feeling the familiar ache in his shoulders and the grit beneath his fingernails. This stone, this arduous process, this was his life. Carving beauty from the unyielding earth, breathing life into inanimate rock. But today, as the wind whipped around him, he felt a tremor in the earth that had nothing to do with his hammer and chisel. A primal fear, ancient and unsettling, settled in the pit of his stomach. Something was coming. Something that even the mountains couldn't stand against.

## Setting:

The story is set in the rugged, mountainous region bordering the kingdom of Alderbrook. Specifically, Elias Thorne's workplace is a windswept, exposed crag high on the slopes of Mount Cinderfang, overlooking the small village of Oakhaven nestled in the valley below. Oakhaven itself is a humble village, populated mainly by farmers and shepherds, its houses built from the grey stone hewn from the mountain. In the distance, on a higher peak overlooking Oakhaven, looms the imposing Castle Ravenwood, a relatively new construction boasting formidable defenses and a constant reminder of the Baron's power. The surrounding landscape is dominated by jagged peaks, dense forests clinging to the lower slopes, and deep, shadowed valleys. The weather is harsh and unpredictable, often shifting from clear skies to fierce blizzards in a matter of hours. The entire region feels ancient and untamed, holding a history and secrets buried deep within its stony heart.
