The wind howled like a banshee, clawing at the chrome of Abigail Mae "Abby" Callahan's Kenworth. Inside, the cab was a cocoon of warm vinyl and the low thrum of the engine, a stark contrast to the blizzard raging outside. Abby gripped the wheel, her knuckles white, squinting against the blinding snow that whipped across the I-80 in Wyoming. The GPS glowed a cold, indifferent blue, promising another three hundred miles to Cheyenne.

Abby, 42, with her salt-and-pepper braids tucked under a worn baseball cap emblazoned with "Callahan & Daughter Trucking - We Haul It All," hadn't signed up for this. This was supposed to be a routine run of frozen beef ribs from Omaha to a processing plant in Cheyenne. A simple milk run. But Mother Nature, as she often did, had other plans.

The radio crackled to life, a garbled voice fighting through the static. "...visibility near zero...advise all truckers to seek shelter..." Abby grimaced. Sheltering wasn't in the cards. Her schedule was tight, the company depending on her. Besides, Abby Callahan didn't back down from a little snow. Or a lot, for that matter. Her daddy, a trucker himself, had taught her to respect the road, not fear it. Still, a prickle of unease ran down her spine. This felt different. This felt *wrong*.
