The opulent lobby of the Grand Majestic Hotel hummed with a low, luxurious thrum. Sunlight, filtered through stained-glass depictions of fantastical griffins, painted the marble floor in kaleidoscopic hues.  A tinkling melody, played on a grand piano tucked discreetly behind a towering fern, filled the air. It was the kind of place where hushed whispers spoke of fortunes made and secrets kept.  This was Beatrice Clementine Moreauâ€™s domain, and she ruled it with the effortless grace of a seasoned conductor leading a world-class orchestra.  Dressed impeccably in a midnight blue suit, a single pearl gleaming at her throat, Beatrice surveyed the scene with a practiced, yet genuinely warm smile.  Outside, the Parisian rain hammered against the large arched windows, but within these hallowed walls, all was calm, controlled, and exquisitely catered.  This Tuesday, however, Beatrice had a feeling that the calm was about to be shattered.
