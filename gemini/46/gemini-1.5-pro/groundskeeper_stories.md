Wysteria Hall's gardens, normally a riot of color, were now a muted tapestry of browns and greys, punctuated by the skeletal silhouettes of rose bushes. Frost crunched beneath his worn boots as he walked the familiar path towards the greenhouse, its mismatched panes glowing a warm amber in the pre-dawn gloom. Elias, his breath clouding in the frigid air, adjusted the brim of his cap.  The Hall itself loomed behind him, a gothic monstrosity of stone and shadow, its many windows like vacant eyes staring out at the encroaching winter. It was a grand, if slightly unsettling, place to work, and Elias, despite the chill seeping into his bones, felt a strange sense of belonging within its sprawling, slightly overgrown embrace.
