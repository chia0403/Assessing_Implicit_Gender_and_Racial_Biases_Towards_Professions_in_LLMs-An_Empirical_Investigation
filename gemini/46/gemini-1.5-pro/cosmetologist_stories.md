The pungent aroma of perm solution mingled with the sweet scent of hairspray, a familiar cocktail that hung heavy in the air of Shear Perfection.  Rain lashed against the large front windows of the salon, blurring the neon glow of the "Open" sign.  Tuesday afternoons were usually slow, but today was exceptionally quiet.  Elara Jane Holloway, perched on a rolling stool behind the reception desk, idly flipped through a dog-eared copy of "Cosmopolitan," the rhythmic snip-snip of her own scissors punctuating the silence as she meticulously trimmed a stray thread from her meticulously manicured nails. The only other sound was the gentle hum of the dryers from beneath the plastic hoods of two elderly ladies, their wrinkled faces obscured by magazines, lost in the tranquil world of weekly gossip.  Shear Perfection, nestled between a laundromat and a dilapidated pizza parlor on Elm Street, was Elara Jane's kingdom, a haven of hairspray and high drama in the otherwise unremarkable town of Harmony Glade, Pennsylvania.  And today, Elara Jane had a feeling that the quiet before the storm was about to break.
