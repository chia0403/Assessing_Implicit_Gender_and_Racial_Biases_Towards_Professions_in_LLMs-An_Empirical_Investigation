The rhythmic clatter of typewriter keys filled the small, stuffy office, punctuated by the occasional *ding* of the bell signifying the end of a line.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight struggling to pierce the grime on the windowpane, illuminating Beatrice Amelia Hawthorne's perfectly coiffed auburn hair. It was a Tuesday in late August, 1957, and the air in Zenith City, Missouri, hung heavy and humid, promising a thunderstorm later in the day. Beatrice, perched on her secretarial chair – its faded green vinyl clinging uncomfortably to her nylon stockings – adjusted her cat-eye glasses and sighed. Another letter dictated, another perfectly typed missive signed by the unseen hand of Mr. Henderson, the elusive president of Henderson's Haberdashery.  Beatrice had been his secretary for five years, yet she’d never actually met the man. All communication was conducted through a small brass speaking tube that snaked its way from his office, high on the third floor, down to her desk on the first. Today's correspondence concerned a particularly contentious shipment of felt bowler hats, and Beatrice could practically hear the beads of sweat forming on Mr. Henderson’s brow through the tinny distortion of the voice tube.  Little did Beatrice know, this seemingly ordinary Tuesday was about to become anything but.
