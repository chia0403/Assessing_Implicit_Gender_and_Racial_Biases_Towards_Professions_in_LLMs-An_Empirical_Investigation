The flickering neon sign of the Starlight Motel cast a lurid, green glow on the rain-slicked asphalt.  Raindrops, fat and cold, hammered against the dented hood of Amelia Grace Holloway's 1998 Ford Taurus, a rhythmic counterpoint to the growl of her rumbling stomach.  Amelia, a cosmetics salesperson for "Beaut√© Toujours," tapped her perfectly manicured fingernails against the steering wheel, her ruby-red lipstick a stark contrast to the grimness of her surroundings. Winslow, Arizona, population 3,842 (or so the faded welcome sign claimed), wasn't exactly a booming metropolis. In fact, it looked like the kind of town where tumbleweeds might spontaneously combust from sheer boredom.  It was the last stop on Amelia's sales route, a place she'd dreaded since seeing it pinned, a lonely red thumbtack, on her territory map.  She needed this sale, though.  Needed it bad.  The regional manager had made it clear: hit her quota or hit the highway. And the desert highway, stretching out into the ink-black night, seemed less daunting than the prospect of unemployment.
