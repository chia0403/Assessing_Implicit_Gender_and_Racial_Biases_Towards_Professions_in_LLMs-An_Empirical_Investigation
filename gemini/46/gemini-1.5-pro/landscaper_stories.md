The biting wind whipped across the desolate expanse of Mrs. Periwinkle's estate, sending fallen oak leaves skittering across the frost-kissed lawn like frightened mice. Elias Thorne, his breath puffing out in white clouds, surveyed the scene with a practiced eye.  He tugged the brim of his worn tweed cap lower, shielding his face from the early November chill that clung to the air like a damp shroud.

The formal gardens, once a riot of color and fragrant blooms, now lay dormant and skeletal, awaiting his touch to coax them back to life.  A thin layer of frost dusted the intricate boxwood hedges, transforming them into shimmering emerald sculptures.  This was Elias's canvas, his domain. And winter, despite its harsh beauty, was always his greatest challenge.
