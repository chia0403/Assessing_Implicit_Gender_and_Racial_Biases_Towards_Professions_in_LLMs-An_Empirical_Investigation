The biting wind whipped Amelia "Mia" Rodriguez's auburn hair across her face as she stared up at the skeletal remains of the Ferris wheel. Rust gnawed at its metal bones, and the chipped paint peeled away like sunburnt skin.  Coney Island in February wasn't the bustling, vibrant spectacle it was in the summer.  Instead, a desolate, grey quiet had settled over the amusement park, the salty tang of the ocean air carrying a melancholic undercurrent. Mia, bundled in a thick, navy wool coat, pulled her scarf tighter and jotted down a few observations in her worn leather notebook.  This wasn't the story she'd been sent to cover - a puff piece on the planned renovations for the upcoming season - but the eerily empty park held a different story, one whispering beneath the creak of the rusted swings and the mournful cries of the gulls overhead. A story she couldn't ignore.
