The insistent Florida sun, already a brutal force at 8:00 am, beat down on the pastel pink stucco of the "Smile Bright Dental Clinic." Inside, where the air conditioning hummed a constant, reassuring drone, Amelia Rose Hernandez meticulously polished the stainless steel instruments she'd need for her first patient.  Palm trees swayed rhythmically outside the window, offering a tantalizing glimpse of the sparkling turquoise ocean just beyond the bustling highway.  But Amelia barely noticed. Her mind was already running through Mrs. Periwinkle's chart, mentally preparing for the delicate task of scaling around the elderly woman's notoriously sensitive gums. The scent of antiseptic mingled with the sickly sweet aroma of artificial pineapple air freshener, a signature combination that permeated every corner of the clinic. It was a smell Amelia had initially found repulsive, but after five years, it had become the oddly comforting aroma of home.
