The biting November wind howled down Sycamore Street, rattling the antique apothecary jars in the window of Elderflower & Thyme.  Inside, amidst the comforting scent of cinnamon and clove, Elara Juniper Hawthorne, PharmD, meticulously counted out metformin tablets, her brow furrowed in concentration. The late afternoon sun, a pale, watery disc behind the scudding clouds, cast long shadows across the polished wooden floorboards.  Elderflower & Thyme was more than just a pharmacy; it was a haven, a relic of a gentler time, nestled in the heart of the bustling, often indifferent city of Portland, Oregon.  Elara had inherited it from her grandmother, a woman whose wisdom extended far beyond the pharmacopoeia, and she felt the weight of that legacy in every creak of the floorboards, every clink of glass.  But today, the usual comforting rhythm of the shop was disrupted by a gnawing unease.  Something felt different, wrong, like a discordant note in a familiar melody.
