The rhythmic *snick-snack* of shears slicing through heavy wool echoed in the small, cluttered workshop, punctuated by the occasional sigh of the old treadle sewing machine. Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of afternoon sun that pierced the grime-streaked windowpane, illuminating the meticulously organized chaos of Elias Thorne's world.  Elias, his silver-rimmed spectacles perched precariously on his nose, meticulously pinned a length of deep crimson velvet to a dress form.  His shop, Thorne's Tailor Shop and Haberdashery, nestled between a boisterous pub and a perpetually shuttered apothecary in the cobbled alleyways of Lower Blackwood, was a sanctuary of quiet industry in the otherwise bustling port city.  The air, thick with the scent of beeswax, pipe tobacco, and aged cloth, hummed with a palpable sense of history, woven into every thread and button that lined the shop's walls.  Outside, the cries of gulls mingled with the distant clang of ship bells, a constant reminder of Blackwoodâ€™s restless spirit, a spirit that rarely touched the hushed reverence of Elias's craft.
