The flickering gaslight cast elongated shadows across the rain-slicked cobblestones of Back Alley Way, illuminating a chipped enamel sign that read "The Nightingale's Perch." Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of stale beer and cheap perfume, a haze of cigarette smoke clinging to the velvet curtains like a shroud.  A single spotlight, more yellow than white, shone down on the small, elevated stage.  Eleanor Ainsworth, her throat coated in a soothing honey and lemon concoction, adjusted the worn silk shawl around her shoulders, her heart hammering against her ribs a frantic rhythm that rivaled the ragtime piano tinkling from the corner. Tonight, she was determined to make them listen. Tonight, she was going to sing her heart out, not for the paltry tips tossed her way or the watered-down whiskey offered by the barkeep, but for the sliver of hope that resided within her, the dream that one day, her voice would carry her beyond the dimly lit confines of The Nightingale's Perch and into the glittering world beyond.
