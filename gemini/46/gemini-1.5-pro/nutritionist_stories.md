The biting November wind whipped Eleanor Vance's auburn braid across her face as she hurried down Bleecker Street, the scent of roasting chestnuts battling the pervasive aroma of diesel fumes.  Eleanor, a registered dietitian with a penchant for cashmere sweaters and a deep-seated distrust of fad diets, clutched a battered leather satchel overflowing with client files. Her destination: Number 17, a pre-war brownstone sandwiched between a trendy vegan cafe and a suspiciously empty storefront that promised, in peeling gold lettering, "Authentic Neapolitan Pizza, Coming Soon." The brownstone housed "Flourish," Eleanor's nutrition practice, a haven of whole grains, sensible portions, and unwavering support – or at least, that’s what she strived for.  This particular Tuesday, however, a sense of unease prickled at the edges of her usually unflappable demeanor.  The appointment waiting for her inside was with a new client, a Mr. Silas Blackwood, who had insisted on complete confidentiality, paying for six months of consultations in advance and refusing to disclose anything about his dietary concerns.  Eleanor, ever the pragmatist, had initially dismissed her apprehension as simple curiosity, but the insistent, almost frantic tone of Mr. Blackwood's voice on the phone had lingered, a dissonant note in the otherwise harmonious hum of her day.
