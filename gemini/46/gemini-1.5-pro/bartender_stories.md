Rain lashed against the stained-glass window depicting St. Jude, patron saint of lost causes, a fitting emblem for The Rusty Mug.  Inside, the air hung thick with the mingled scents of stale beer, damp wool, and desperation.  A single, flickering gas lamp cast long shadows across the dusty mahogany bar, illuminating the chipped ceramic mugs hanging upside down behind it.  Eleanor Vance, her fiery red hair pulled back in a tight bun, wiped down the sticky surface with a practiced hand, her emerald green eyes reflecting the flickering light. It was a Tuesday night in Port Blossom, Oregon, a town where the fog rolled in thicker than the tourists, and tonight, the only company Eleanor had was the mournful wail of the foghorn and the rhythmic drip, drip, drip of a leaky faucet.  She knew, with a certainty that settled deep in her bones, that tonight was going to be a long one.
