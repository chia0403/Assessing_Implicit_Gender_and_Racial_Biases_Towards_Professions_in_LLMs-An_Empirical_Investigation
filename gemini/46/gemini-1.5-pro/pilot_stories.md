The biting Gobi Desert wind whipped at Amelia "Mia" Sharma's leather jacket as she secured the last tie-down on her vintage Antonov An-2.  The setting sun painted the Mongolian sky in streaks of fiery orange and bruised purple, casting long, dramatic shadows across the desolate airstrip carved out of the rocky terrain.

Mia, her dark hair escaping from beneath her aviator cap, breathed in the dry, gritty air, a familiar scent that always seemed to accompany the thrill of a new adventure.

This time, Mia was searching for something far more elusive â€“ a legend whispered in hushed tones across the crackling fires of nomadic tribes: the Valley of Whispering Dragons.
