The Nevada sun, a malevolent eye in the vast, bleached sky, beat down on the cab of the Peterbilt 389.  Dust devils danced across the cracked asphalt of Highway 50, swirling like restless spirits. Inside, the air conditioning battled the oppressive heat with a low, determined hum. Delilah "Dee" Jones gripped the steering wheel, her knuckles white against the worn leather.  Her CB handle, “Desert Fox,” crackled to life, a lone voice breaking the monotony of the endless highway.  Miles of scrub brush and desolate landscape stretched out before her, punctuated only by the occasional skeletal remains of a long-forgotten gas station. This desolate stretch of road, aptly nicknamed "The Loneliest Road in America," was Dee’s domain, her office, her kingdom, and sometimes, her prison.  She was hauling a load of electronics from Reno to Ely, a run she'd made countless times, but this time, something felt different. A prickle of unease ran down her spine, a feeling as dry and brittle as the desert itself.
