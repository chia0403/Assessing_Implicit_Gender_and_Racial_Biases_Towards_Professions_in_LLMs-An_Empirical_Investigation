The scent of sawdust and pine sap hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Elias Thorne.  He adjusted the thick leather apron over his worn overalls, the morning sun, still low in the sky, casting long shadows across the cluttered floor of his workshop.  Nestled on the outskirts of Oakhaven, a small town tucked away in the Appalachian foothills, the workshop was a testament to Elias's life's work.  Every inch of the rough-hewn timber walls was adorned with tools â€“ chisels, planes, saws, and mallets, each gleaming softly in the burgeoning light.  Outside, the crisp October air nipped at the edges of the vibrant autumn leaves, the sound of a nearby stream gurgling a gentle counterpoint to the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Elias's hammer as he began his day.
