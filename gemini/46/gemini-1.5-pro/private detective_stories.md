Rain lashed against the grimy window of Elias Thorne's office, a staccato rhythm against the low hum of a barely functioning radiator.  Neon light from a flickering sign across the street painted the room in alternating washes of emerald and shadow, highlighting the dust motes dancing in the weak beams. The office, nestled above a laundromat on Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village, wasn't much to look at: a cramped space dominated by a battered oak desk, two mismatched chairs, and overflowing filing cabinets that threatened to collapse under the weight of unsolved cases and unpaid bills. Elias Thorne, his trench coat still dripping onto the threadbare rug, rubbed the sleep from his eyes and poured himself a generous measure of bourbon from a bottle hidden beneath a stack of old newspapers.  It was 3:17 am, and the city that never sleeps was whispering a particularly unsettling lullaby. The insistent jangle of the telephone cut through the night's symphony, a jarring counterpoint to the rhythmic drumming of the rain.
