Rain lashed against the gothic arch windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside him.  The room, nestled high in a converted Victorian mansion overlooking the fog-choked streets of Edinburgh, usually offered him a sense of calm. Tonight, the usually comforting scent of old books and pipe tobacco did little to soothe the gnawing anxiety that tightened his chest.  Elias paced the Persian rug, the rhythmic creak of his worn leather shoes a counterpoint to the relentless drumming of the rain. He ran a hand through his already disheveled dark hair, his piercing blue eyes fixed on the flickering gaslight illuminating the half-finished psychological profile spread across his mahogany desk. The case – the brutal and baffling murder of a renowned historian in the shadowed closes of Old Town – was proving more complex than he'd initially anticipated.  The killer had left no physical trace, only a cryptic symbol etched into the victim's desk, a symbol that haunted Elias's dreams and hinted at a darkness that ran far deeper than the city's already murky history.
