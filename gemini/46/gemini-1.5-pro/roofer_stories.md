The rusty tang of dawn hung heavy in the air, mingling with the scent of asphalt shingles and freshly brewed coffee.  Atop the gambrel roof of the old Victorian on Sycamore Street, Elias Thorne, his calloused hands already stained black from tar, surveyed the sleepy town of Havenwood, Illinois.  Below him, nestled amongst the maples and oaks, the houses resembled a child's haphazardly placed building blocks, their chimneys puffing lazy wisps of smoke into the still morning air. The sun, a hazy orange orb, was just beginning its ascent, casting long, skeletal shadows across the dew-kissed lawns. Elias took a long pull from his thermos, the hot coffee a welcome balm against the early autumn chill that promised a colder day to come.  This was his ritual, this quiet communion with the rising sun before the hammers started their rhythmic pounding and the world below woke to another day.  But today, perched precariously on the edge of Mrs. Gableâ€™s steeply pitched roof, Elias felt a prickle of unease, a sense that this day would be anything but ordinary.
