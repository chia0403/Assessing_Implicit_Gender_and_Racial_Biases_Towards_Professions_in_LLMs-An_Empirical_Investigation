The bell above the door of "Nailed It," a tiny salon squeezed between a laundromat and a suspiciously permanent "Grand Opening" bannered discount furniture store, jingled merrily. Rain lashed against the window, blurring the neon "OPEN" sign into a hazy pink smear.  Inside, Eliza June Hawthorne, her fiery red hair pulled back into a practical bun, sighed, wiping down the already spotless chrome of her manicure station. The relentless downpour of a typical Seattle November had kept clients away all afternoon, leaving Eliza with nothing but the rhythmic drumming of the rain and the hum of the UV lamp for company.  The air hung heavy with the scent of acetone and a faint, lingering aroma of the gingerbread latte she’d treated herself to earlier – a small indulgence against the creeping grayness of the day.  Outside, the streetlights flickered on, casting a sickly yellow glow on the deserted sidewalk. Eliza glanced at the clock: 5:17 pm. Another slow day drawing to a close. Little did she know, a knock at the door in just a few minutes would change everything.
