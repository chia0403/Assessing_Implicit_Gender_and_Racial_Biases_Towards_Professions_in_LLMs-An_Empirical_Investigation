The revolving doors of the Grand Majestic Hotel sighed open, admitting a gust of frigid Chicago air and a flurry of fat snowflakes that immediately began to melt on the plush crimson carpet.  Bartholomew "Barty" Higgins, his pillbox hat perched precariously atop his head, shivered despite the thick wool of his uniform.  The lobby, a cavernous space dripping with crystal chandeliers and gilded everything, hummed with the low murmur of affluent conversations and the clinking of ice in expensive cocktails.  January in the Windy City meant a lull in tourism, but the Grand Majestic, a bastion of old-money elegance, always maintained a steady clientele, even when the lakefront froze solid.  Barty, a wiry young man with a quick smile and an even quicker wit, straightened his uniform and prepared for the evening rush, praying it wouldn't be as slow as the previous night.  He'd wagered a week's tips with Millie from the coat check that tonight would be busy, and he couldn't afford to lose. Not with his grandmother's birthday coming up.
