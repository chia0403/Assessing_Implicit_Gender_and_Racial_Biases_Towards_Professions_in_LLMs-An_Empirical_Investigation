The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Grimshaw & Sons General Store, a relentless rhythm that mirrored the throbbing headache pounding behind Amelia Grace Hawthorne's eyes. Dust motes danced in the weak, flickering fluorescent light that illuminated her cramped office, a space carved out between sacks of fertilizer and stacks of canned peaches.  Aibonito, Puerto Rico, usually vibrated with the buzz of coquí frogs and the scent of blooming jasmine, but tonight, the only aroma was the damp earth and the faint metallic tang of the approaching storm.  Amelia, hunched over her ledger, meticulously entered the day's transactions, each careful stroke of her pen a small act of defiance against the chaos brewing both inside and outside the store.  Mr. Grimshaw, a man whose jowls wobbled like a nervous chihuahua's, had warned her about hurricane season, but nothing could have prepared her for this.  The wind howled like a banshee, rattling the windows and threatening to rip the flimsy structure from its foundations.  Suddenly, a flash of lightning illuminated the store, followed by a deafening crack of thunder that sent a stack of seed packets tumbling to the floor.  And that's when Amelia noticed it – a discrepancy in the accounts, a missing sum of $5,000 that simply shouldn't be there.
