The frosted breath of Elias Thorne, Head Librarian of the Whispering Pines Public Library, plumed before him as he unlocked the heavy oak doors.  The pre-dawn sky above the small Oregon town was a bruised purple, the evergreens lining Main Street still cloaked in shadow.  Inside, the library held a hush deeper than the sleeping town outside, a stillness punctuated only by the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the reading room. Dust motes danced in the slivers of light filtering through the tall, arched windows, illuminating rows upon rows of silent, watchful books.  This quiet sanctuary, smelling of old paper and beeswax, was Elias's domain, a place where he felt more at home than anywhere else in the world.  But this morning, something felt different.  A faint, unsettling tremor vibrated in the air, a discordant note in the usual symphony of stillness.
