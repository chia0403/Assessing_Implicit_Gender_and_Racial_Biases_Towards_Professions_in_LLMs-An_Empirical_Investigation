The rusty bell above the door of "Finnegan's Fine Cuts" jangled a mournful tune as it announced the arrival of Mrs. Henderson, her perm a towering testament to the staying power of Aqua Net.  The late afternoon sun, filtered through the dusty panes of the barbershop window, painted stripes across the worn checkerboard floor.  Bartholomew "Barty" Finch, the proprietor and sole barber, sighed and laid down the sports section of the Gazette.  Dust motes danced in the golden light, illuminating the faded photographs of prize-winning hairstyles that adorned the wood-panelled walls, relics of a time when Barty's scissors had a little more spring in them and his clientele a little less grey.  Finnegan's Fine Cuts sat nestled between a laundromat with a perpetually broken dryer and a bakery that specialized in day-old donuts on the quiet, almost forgotten end of Harmony Street, a place where the rhythm of life was slow and predictable, just the way Barty liked it.
