The fluorescent lights of the Zenith Bio-Research building hummed a monotonous B-flat, the only sound in the deserted lobby besides the squeak of Elias Thorne's mop against the polished marble floor.  Outside, the Chicago wind howled, rattling the glass doors and spitting icy rain against the windows. It was 2:17 am, the deepest part of the night, a time when the city held its breath and the secrets it kept settled like dust in the corners. Elias, a man built of solid angles and quiet dignity, pushed his mop methodically, his face etched with a weariness that went deeper than the long shift. Zenith Bio-Research, with its gleaming chrome and hushed laboratories, was a temple of science, a place where miracles were supposedly manufactured. But to Elias, it was just another mess waiting to be cleaned up, another expanse of human imperfection swept under the rug of progress. Tonight, however, the air felt different, charged with a strange energy that prickled his skin.  The usual sterile scent of disinfectant was overlaid with something else, something...metallic.
