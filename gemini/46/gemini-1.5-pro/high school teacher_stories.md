The biting November wind whipped around Eleanor Vance’s ankles as she hurried across the faculty parking lot, clutching a stack of graded essays to her chest.  Grey clouds, heavy with the promise of snow, pressed low over the squat brick building of Northwood High.  Fluorescent lights buzzed in the windows, casting a sickly yellow glow onto the already-depressing landscape of cracked asphalt and scraggly, frost-bitten bushes.  Eleanor shivered, pulling her threadbare coat tighter. It was only 4:30 pm, but already dusk had settled, swallowing the last vestiges of daylight and casting long, skeletal shadows from the bare branches of the oak trees lining the perimeter fence.  Inside, the clamor of the final bell still echoed faintly, a receding tide of adolescent energy leaving behind a strange, almost unsettling quiet.  This was Eleanor's least favorite time of day – the in-between, the moment of transition when the frenetic energy of the school day gave way to the lonely stillness of the approaching night.  Tonight, however, the quiet felt particularly ominous.
