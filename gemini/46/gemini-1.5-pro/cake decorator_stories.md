The scent of caramelizing sugar hung heavy in the air, mingling with the fainter notes of almond and vanilla.  Rain lashed against the large windows of "The Gilded Lily," blurring the neon glow of the "Open" sign reflecting on the wet pavement outside.

The Gilded Lily, nestled between a dusty antique shop and a perpetually overflowing laundromat on Bleecker Street, was Eliza Jane's pride and joy, a testament to her unwavering passion for transforming flour, sugar, and butter into edible works of art.  Tonight, however, a sense of unease prickled at the edges of her usually unflappable demeanor.  The wedding was tomorrow, and the forecast called for a blizzard.
