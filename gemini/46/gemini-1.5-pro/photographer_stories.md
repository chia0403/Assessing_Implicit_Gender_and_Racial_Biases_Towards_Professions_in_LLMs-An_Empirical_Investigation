The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, stinging Elias Thorne's cheeks and rattling the tripod legs of his battered Hasselblad.  Grey cliffs, streaked with rust-coloured lichen, plunged dramatically into the churning, iron-grey water below.  Seabirds wheeled overhead, their cries lost in the roar of the wind. Elias, perched precariously on a sliver of rock jutting out over the abyss, tightened his grip on the camera, ignoring the tremor of fear that always accompanied these perilous shoots. This was the northernmost point of the Shetland Islands, Muckle Flugga, a desolate, windswept outpost where the Atlantic Ocean clashed with the North Sea.  Heâ€™d travelled for three days, enduring a ferry crossing so rough that even the seasoned sailors looked green, to capture this desolate beauty, this raw, untamed edge of the world.  He was here to photograph the light, that ethereal, ever-shifting light that painted the sky in hues unseen anywhere else on earth.  And today, with the storm clouds gathering and the sun struggling to break through, he knew he was about to witness something truly extraordinary.
