The flickering fluorescent lights of the D&M Architectural firm buzzed in Amelia Reyes's ears, a constant, irritating hum that mirrored the anxiety thrumming in her chest. It was 5:58 pm on a Friday, and the air in the drafting room, usually thick with the scent of pencil shavings and stale coffee, was tinged with the sweet relief of impending freedom.

Outside, the Chicago wind howled against the glass windows of the high-rise, a chilling reminder of the November gloom descending on the city. The rhythmic tap-tap-tap of her mechanical pencil against the vellum was the only sound breaking the tense silence, a counterpoint to the city's restless symphony just beyond the pane.  The deadline for the Henderson project, a sprawling luxury condominium complex destined to pierce the already crowded skyline, was looming, and Amelia was the only one left standing between a finished blueprint and utter chaos.
