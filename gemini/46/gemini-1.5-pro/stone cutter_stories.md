The biting wind whipped across the desolate expanse of the Whispering Plateau, carrying with it the fine dust of pulverized granite and the mournful cry of some unseen bird of prey.  Here, where the sky bled into a bruised purple each evening, Elias Thorne, a man whose hands were rougher than the stone he shaped, had carved out a solitary existence.  His workshop, little more than a windbreak built from stacked slate slabs and salvaged timber, clung precariously to the edge of the plateau, overlooking a dizzying drop to the valley below.  Inside, the air, thick with the scent of stone dust and lamp oil, glowed warmly in the flickering light of a single lantern. Elias, his face etched with the same lines and crevices as the rock face he'd spent his life studying, ran a calloused thumb over the smooth surface of a half-finished gargoyle, its granite wings still folded against its back.  The coming storm promised to be a brutal one, and he had little time left to finish before the first flakes of snow began to fall.
