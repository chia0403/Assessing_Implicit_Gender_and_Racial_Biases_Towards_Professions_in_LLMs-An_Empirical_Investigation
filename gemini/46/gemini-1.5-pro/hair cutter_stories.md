The rusty bell above the door of "Shear Delights" jingled merrily, announcing the arrival of Mrs. Periwinkle, a woman whose blue rinse was so vibrant it practically hummed. Elias Thorne, the proprietor and sole stylist, sighed inwardly.  Mrs. Periwinkle was notorious for her lengthy, detailed critiques of every curl and quiff.  The late afternoon sun, filtered through the grime-streaked window of his tiny barbershop, cast long shadows across the worn checkerboard floor.  Shear Delights sat nestled between a dilapidated laundromat and a perpetually closed fortune teller's parlor on Bleaker Street, a narrow, forgotten lane in the heart of a bustling, otherwise modern metropolis.  The air inside, thick with the scent of hairspray and bay rum, hung heavy and still, a stark contrast to the frenetic energy that thrummed just a block away.  Elias, wiping his hands on his already threadbare apron, plastered a professional smile on his face and greeted Mrs. Periwinkle with a forced cheerfulness that belied the sinking feeling in his gut. This was going to be a long one.
