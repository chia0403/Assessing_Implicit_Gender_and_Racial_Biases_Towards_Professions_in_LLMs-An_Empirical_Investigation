Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the Kressler Building, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Amelia Hayes.  She tapped a chipped, burgundy nail against the peeling Formica of her desk, watching the city lights blur through the streaks of water.

The air hung thick with the stale scent of instant coffee and desperation, a familiar aroma in this corner of the legal world. Tonightâ€™s desperation belonged solely to Amelia, though.  Mr. Jacoby, a portly man whose face seemed perpetually etched with a mixture of indigestion and disdain, had left hours ago, leaving her to wrestle with the mountain of documents related to the Peterson vs. City of Chicago case, a seemingly endless labyrinth of permits, bylaws, and sworn affidavits.
