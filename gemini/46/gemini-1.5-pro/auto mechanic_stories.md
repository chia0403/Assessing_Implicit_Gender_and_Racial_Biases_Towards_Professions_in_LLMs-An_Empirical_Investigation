The biting wind whipped across the cracked asphalt of the Harmony Creek junkyard, sending a flurry of rusted flakes spiraling into the air.  Eleanor "Ellie" Vance, her hands blackened with grease and her knuckles raw from the cold, hunched deeper under the hood of a cherry-red 1967 Mustang Fastback.  Harmony Creek, population 842 (and dwindling), wasn't exactly a hotbed of classic car restoration, but this Mustang, abandoned for years in the shadow of a collapsed barn, had whispered a siren song to Ellie since she was a kid. Now, with the junkyard owner finally agreeing to sell it for a song, Ellie was determined to coax the sleeping beauty back to life.  The air smelled of motor oil, rust, and the faint, sweet decay of fallen leaves, a scent Ellie found oddly comforting.  A pale winter sun struggled to break through the iron-grey clouds, casting long, skeletal shadows across the rows of decaying vehicles â€“ a graveyard of forgotten dreams that Ellie, with her wrench and her unwavering optimism, aimed to resurrect, one car at a time.
