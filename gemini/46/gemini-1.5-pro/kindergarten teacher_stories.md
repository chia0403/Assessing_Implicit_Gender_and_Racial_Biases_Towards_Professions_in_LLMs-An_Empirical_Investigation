The aroma of stale apple juice and dried Play-Doh hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume Miss Amelia Thistlewick had come to associate with Monday mornings.  Sunlight, filtered through the large, rainbow-splattered windows of Room 3, cast dust motes dancing in the air, illuminating tiny handprints smeared across the glass. Outside, the crisp October air rustled the leaves of the giant oak that dominated the playground of Maplewood Elementary, its branches scraping against the brick wall like skeletal fingers.  Amelia, her curly brown hair pulled back in a messy bun, surveyed the colorful chaos of her classroom. Tiny chairs were overturned, blocks lay scattered like a miniature cityscape after an earthquake, and a single, glittery purple crayon lay abandoned beneath the easel, a testament to Friday’s enthusiastic art session.  This was her domain, her kingdom of glitter glue, misspelled words, and boundless, untamed energy. And, despite the looming mountain of tidying, a smile played on Amelia's lips.  This week promised to be an interesting one – she could feel it in her bones.
