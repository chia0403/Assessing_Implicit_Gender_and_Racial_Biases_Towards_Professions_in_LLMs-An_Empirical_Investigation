The biting Antarctic wind whipped Dr. Aris Thorne's auburn braid across her face as she wrestled the heavy steel door closed against the gale. Ice crystals, fine as diamond dust, swirled around her insulated boots, clinging to the bright orange of her parka.  The Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, a cluster of interconnected modular buildings perched precariously on stilts above the shifting ice, hummed with a low, constant thrum – a symphony of generators, ventilation systems, and the ceaseless whisper of scientific equipment. Inside the confines of her specialized lab, designated Lab 42 – ironically, given her decidedly un-humorous nature – Aris exhaled, a plume of condensation fogging her goggles.  She was alone, save for the blinking lights of the neutrino detector and the faint green glow of the aurora australis filtering through the frosted windowpane. Tonight, Aris was on the cusp of something extraordinary. Something that could redefine our understanding of the universe, or shatter it entirely.
