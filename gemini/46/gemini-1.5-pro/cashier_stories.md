The fluorescent lights of the Quick Stop, a 24-hour convenience store nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed-down video rental store, hummed a monotonous B flat.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the already faded "Hot Pizza" sign. Inside, the air hung thick with the mingled scent of stale coffee, artificially buttered popcorn, and a faint, underlying tang of despair.  Elara Jane Peterson, her nametag slightly askew on her faded blue polo shirt, chewed on the end of a ballpoint pen, watching the second hand on the wall clock tick with agonizing slowness.  It was 3:17 AM, the deadest part of the graveyard shift, and her only company was the rhythmic drip of a leaky faucet in the back and the flickering neon glow of the lottery ticket dispenser.  Tonight, even the usual stray cats that prowled the dumpster out back seemed to have sought better shelter.  Elara sighed, the sound swallowed by the pervasive hum, and idly rearranged the dusty rack of beef jerky.  Something told her tonight was going to be different.
