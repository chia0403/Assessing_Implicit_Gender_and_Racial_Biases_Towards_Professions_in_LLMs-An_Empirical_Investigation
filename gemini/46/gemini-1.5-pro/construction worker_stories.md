The pre-dawn sky over Cleveland was a bruised purple, streaked with the oily orange of encroaching sunrise.  A damp chill hung in the air, clinging to the steel skeleton of the half-finished skyscraper that dominated the cityscape.  Twenty stories up, clinging to a girder with the practiced ease of a mountain goat,  Elijah "Eli"  McCoy wrestled a stubborn section of scaffolding into place.  The wind whipped around him, biting through his worn denim jacket, but Eli barely noticed. He was focused on the task at hand, the rhythmic clang of metal against metal a familiar percussion against the backdrop of the awakening city. Below, the streets were still mostly deserted, save for the occasional delivery truck rumbling past and the distant wail of a siren.  Eli preferred it this way â€“ the quiet before the chaos, the solitude before the symphony of construction noise that would soon erupt around him.  He liked the feeling of being suspended above the world, a solitary figure against the vast canvas of the sky, building something tangible, something that would endure.
