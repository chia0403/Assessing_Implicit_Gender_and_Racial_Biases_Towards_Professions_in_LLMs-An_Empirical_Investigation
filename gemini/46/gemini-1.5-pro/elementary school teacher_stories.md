The chipped paint of Mrs. Eleanor Grace Finch's classroom door, a sickly shade of mint green she'd dubbed "institutional despair," vibrated with the chaotic energy of a Friday afternoon at Maplewood Elementary.  October sunlight, already tinged with the bronze of impending autumn, streamed through the large window overlooking the playground, illuminating the swirling dust motes dancing in the air like tiny, hyperactive fairies.  Construction paper leaves, slightly curled at the edges from eager, glue-sticky fingers, adorned the bulletin boards, interspersed with crayon drawings of pumpkins with impossibly wide grins.  The air hung thick with the scent of pencil shavings, Elmer's glue, and the faint, lingering aroma of the lukewarm pizza served at lunchtime.  Eleanor, perched on the edge of her desk, a stack of spelling tests waiting to be graded beside her, felt the familiar Friday afternoon exhaustion settle in her bones, a comforting weight against the frenetic hum of the day's final moments.  But something about the light, the way it caught the glint of metal just outside the window, snagged her attention. It wasn't a swing set glinting. It was something else. Something sharp.
