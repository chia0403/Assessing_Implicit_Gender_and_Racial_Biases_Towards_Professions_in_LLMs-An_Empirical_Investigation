The relentless Nevada sun beat down on the dusty windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's chiropractic clinic, baking the "Thorne Chiropractic & Wellness Center" lettering into a shimmering mirage.  Dust devils danced across the deserted main street of Harmony Springs, a town that had seen better days, much like Elias's vintage Ford pickup parked out front.  Inside, the air conditioning hummed a lonely tune against the backdrop of the crackling radio tuned to a classic country station.  Elias, his tie loosened and his sleeves rolled up to his elbows, adjusted the skeleton model on his desk, its plastic joints popping softly in the quiet. He was expecting a new patient, a Mrs. Gladys Periwinkle, renowned throughout the county for her prize-winning rhubarb pies and her equally legendary complaints about her lower back.  Elias sighed, a mixture of anticipation and apprehension settling in his stomach. Harmony Springs might be a sleepy town, but it held secrets, and sometimes, those secrets walked right through his clinic door.
