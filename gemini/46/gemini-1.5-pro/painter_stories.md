The salt-laced wind whipped at Isolde Aurelia Moreau's easel, threatening to tear the canvas from its moorings and send it spiralling into the churning turquoise waters below.  Isolde, perched precariously on a rocky outcrop overlooking the Bay of Biscay, anchored the easel with one foot while the other dangled over the sheer drop.  Far below, the tiny fishing village of Port-Louis clung to the cliffs like a barnacle, its whitewashed houses gleaming against the dark, brooding granite. The air was thick with the scent of brine and the cries of gulls, a symphony of the wild Atlantic that Isolde found endlessly inspiring.  October in Brittany was a volatile mistress, offering moments of breathtaking beauty interspersed with sudden squalls and tempestuous skies. Today, she was in a particularly dramatic mood, and Isolde, ever eager to capture the raw power of nature, had braved the elements to immortalize the scene on canvas.
