The bell above the door of "Petal & Stem" jingled merrily, a counterpoint to the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of Eliza Jane Hawthorne's shears.  Outside, the Charleston, South Carolina air hung thick and humid, shimmering with the promise of an afternoon thunderstorm.  Inside, the small shop was a cool oasis bursting with colour and fragrance. Buckets overflowing with hydrangeas, roses, and lilies lined the walls, their perfume mingling with the earthy scent of damp moss and freshly cut stems. Eliza Jane, her auburn braid draped over one shoulder, hummed along to the Billie Holiday record playing softly on the vintage gramophone, her nimble fingers weaving together a cascade of ivory orchids and deep purple lisianthus. Sunlight, fractured by the prisms hanging in the window, danced across the polished wooden floor, casting rainbows on the bouquets awaiting delivery.  Today, however, the usual tranquility of Petal & Stem held a subtle undercurrent of anticipation.  Eliza Jane was expecting a visitor, one who carried with him the scent of jasmine and the promise of something unexpected.
