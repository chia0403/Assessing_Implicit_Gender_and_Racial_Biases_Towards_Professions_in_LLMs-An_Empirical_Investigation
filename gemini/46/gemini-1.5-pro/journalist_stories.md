Rain lashed against the grimy windows of The Daily Clarion, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Amelia “Mia” Catherine Reyes.  The flickering fluorescent lights of the newsroom cast a sickly yellow glow over scattered desks piled high with discarded drafts and half-empty coffee cups.  It was 2:17 am in the decaying port town of Port Blossom, Maine, a place where the salty air hung thick with the scent of fish and forgotten dreams. Mia, clad in a worn-out cardigan and jeans stained with ink, hunched over her laptop, the glow illuminating the determined set of her jaw.  The cursor on her screen blinked mockingly, a stark white against the blank document.  She was supposed to be writing a fluff piece about the annual Founder's Day clam bake, but a cryptic, anonymous tip about a string of disappearances among the local fishermen had hooked her attention like a barbed line.  Port Blossom might have been a backwater town, but Mia had a nose for stories, and this one smelled of something far more sinister than spoiled seafood.
