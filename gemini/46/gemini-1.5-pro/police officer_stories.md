The flashing blue and red lights reflected off the icy pavement, momentarily illuminating a scene of urban decay â€“ overflowing trash cans, a stray dog foraging for scraps, and a lone figure slumped against the alley wall, a dark stain spreading across the worn concrete beneath them.  Izzy's hand instinctively went to her holster as she stepped out of the car, the crunch of her boots on the frozen ground the only sound louder than the relentless howl of the wind.  Tonight, she knew, was going to be a long one.
