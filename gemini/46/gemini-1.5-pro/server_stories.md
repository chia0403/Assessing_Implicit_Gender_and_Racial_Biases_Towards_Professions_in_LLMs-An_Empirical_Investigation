The chipped Formica tabletop, sticky with the residue of a thousand spilled sodas and forgotten ketchup packets, reflected the flickering neon sign of the Stardust Diner.  Rain lashed against the large front window, blurring the already hazy view of the desolate highway stretching through Harmony Springs, Nevada.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of frying onions and stale coffee.  Elara Jane McMillan, her name tag slightly askew on her faded turquoise uniform, sighed and wiped down the counter with a practiced hand, her thoughts far from the greasy spoon and the handful of regulars huddled inside, seeking refuge from the storm.  She glanced at the clock â€“ 11:47 pm.  Three more tables to wipe down, the coffee machine to clean, and then she could finally escape the fluorescent-lit purgatory and head home to her tiny trailer on the edge of town.  Tonight, however, something felt different.  The wind howled with unusual ferocity, and the neon sign flickered more erratically than usual, casting long, dancing shadows across the deserted booths.  A shiver ran down Elara's spine, a prickle of unease that had nothing to do with the cold.
