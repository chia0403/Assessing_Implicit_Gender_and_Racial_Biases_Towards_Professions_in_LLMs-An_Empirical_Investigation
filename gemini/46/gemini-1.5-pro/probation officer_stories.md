The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Amy” Reyes’s dark hair across her face as she climbed the crumbling concrete steps of the tenement building.  Number 37B, her case file stated, third floor, rear apartment.  Pigeon droppings speckled the chipped paint of the railing, and a faint, acrid smell of stale urine permeated the air.  This was the kind of place that bred despair, the kind of place Amy knew all too well.  The sky above the Bronx was a bruised purple, mirroring the shadows gathering in the alleys below.  It was just past 5pm, the hour when the city seemed to hold its breath, bracing itself for the long, cold night ahead.  Amy adjusted her practical, navy-blue coat and knocked firmly on the peeling wooden door.  This was her third visit to Hector Medina, and he hadn't answered a single time.  This time, she wasn't leaving without a conversation.
