The biting wind, scented with woodsmoke and the faint metallic tang of the nearby abattoir, whipped around Elias Thorne's thick wool coat.  Frost crunched under his heavy boots as he crossed the cobbled lane separating his shop, "Thorne's Fine Meats," from the icy gloom of Winterhaven's market square.  It was barely dawn, the sky a bruised purple bleeding into orange above the snow-dusted peaks of the Irontooth Mountains. Elias, his breath puffing out in white clouds, unlocked the heavy oak door, the familiar jingle of the bell above announcing the start of another day.  Inside, the shop was a haven of warmth, the air thick with the rich, earthy aroma of hanging sausages and curing hams.  The cleavers, honed to razor sharpness, gleamed in the flickering gaslight, waiting patiently for Elias's expert touch. Winterhaven, nestled deep within the frost-kissed valley, was a town that appreciated a good cut of meat, and Elias Thorne was the man to provide it.
