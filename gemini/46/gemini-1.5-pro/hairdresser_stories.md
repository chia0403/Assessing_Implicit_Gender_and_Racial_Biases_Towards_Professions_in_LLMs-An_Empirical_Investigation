The insistent Glasgow rain lashed against the large single-pane window of "Curl Up & Dye," blurring the neon pink script into a shimmering, watery mess.  Inside, the salon was a vibrant contrast to the dreary November day.  Tangerine walls buzzed under the fluorescent lights, while the rhythmic snip of scissors and the whir of hairdryers created a comforting, familiar symphony.  Amelia "Amy" McGregor, a woman whose own hair was a kaleidoscope of ever-changing colours, surveyed her domain with a practiced eye.  A half-finished perm sat under a dryer, emitting a faint chemical aroma that mingled with the sweet scent of coconut shampoo.  Two elderly ladies gossiped under their respective hooded dryers, their voices a low hum against the backdrop of Radio Clyde.  It was a typical Tuesday afternoon, and Amy, despite the damp chill seeping in from the ill-fitting door, felt a contented warmth spread through her. Until, that is, the bell above the door chimed, announcing a new arrival, and a gust of wind swept in a woman unlike any Amy had ever seen.
