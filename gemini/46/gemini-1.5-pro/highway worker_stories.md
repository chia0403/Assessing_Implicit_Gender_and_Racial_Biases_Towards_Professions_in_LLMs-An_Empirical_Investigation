The biting wind whipped across the desolate stretch of Interstate 80, carrying the mournful whistle of a distant train.  Dust devils danced across the cracked asphalt, swirling grit against the bright orange cones that marked Amelia “Millie” Rodriguez’s temporary domain.  The Nevada sun, high and merciless, beat down on her fluorescent vest, baking her already sweat-soaked skin.

Millie, perched precariously on the back of a pothole patcher truck, squinted at the ragged fissure in the road, a dark, gaping maw threatening to swallow a tire whole. This was her life: patching the broken skin of America, one pothole at a time. Today, however, felt different. The air was thick with a static charge, and a strange hum resonated from deep within the earth, making the hairs on her arms stand on end.
