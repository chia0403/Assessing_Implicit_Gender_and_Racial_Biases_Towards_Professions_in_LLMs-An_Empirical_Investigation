Rain lashed against the mullioned windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's office, mimicking the relentless drumming in his own head.  He sat hunched over a half-eaten sandwich, the rye bread soggy, the pastrami curling at the edges, mirroring his own weary slump.  His office, usually a sanctuary of calm, felt oppressive tonight. The Persian rug, normally vibrant with colour, seemed muted in the gloom. The shelves, overflowing with volumes on psychology and philosophy, offered no solace.  Outside, the gothic spires of St. Jude's Hospital, where Elias worked, pierced the bruised London sky, grim sentinels against the encroaching darkness.  It was late November, the air thick with a damp chill that seeped into the very bones, and Elias had a gnawing feeling this particular Tuesday evening was about to get a lot worse.
