The biting November wind whipped at Amelia “Ace” Hernandez’s turnout gear as she stood on the precipice of Widow’s Peak.  Below, nestled in the valley, the sleepy town of Ashbrook glimmered with a deceptive tranquility.  String lights twinkled around the base of the colossal sequoia that gave the town its name, preparing for the annual Winter Festival, oblivious to the inferno brewing on the ridge above.  Dry leaves skittered across the parched earth, whispering warnings that only Ace seemed to hear.  The air crackled with unseen energy, a prelude to the devastation that was about to descend.  Smoke, thick and acrid, began to curl from the dense pine forest just beyond the peak, staining the twilight sky a sickly orange.  Ace gripped her Pulaski axe, the metal cold against her gloved hand.  This wasn't going to be just another brush fire. This one felt…different.
