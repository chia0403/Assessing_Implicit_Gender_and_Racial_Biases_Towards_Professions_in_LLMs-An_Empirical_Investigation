The biting November wind whipped around Eleanor Iris Thorne, plastering stray strands of her auburn hair across her already smudged lipstick.  The skeletal trees lining the cobbled lane rattled like anxious bones, their bare branches scratching against the darkening sky above the dilapidated Grand Guignol Theatre.  Built in 1888, the theatre, tucked away in a forgotten corner of Montmartre, Paris,  had seen better days.  Its once vibrant fa√ßade, depicting scenes of commedia dell'arte, was now chipped and faded, the joyous masks seeming to weep with neglect.  Yet, within its crumbling walls, Eleanor saw not decay, but potential.  This was where she, a director known for her avant-garde interpretations of classic plays, would stage her most ambitious production yet: a reimagining of Oscar Wilde's "Salome," set not in biblical Judea, but in the decadent underworld of 1920s Berlin.
