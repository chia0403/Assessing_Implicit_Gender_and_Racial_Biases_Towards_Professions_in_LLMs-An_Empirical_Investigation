The humid air hung thick and heavy, clinging to Elina Flores’s linen shirt like a second skin. Around her, the vibrant chaos of the Mercado Central in Antigua, Guatemala, swirled in a kaleidoscope of color and sound. Vendors hawked handwoven textiles and jade jewelry, their voices a rhythmic counterpoint to the marimba music drifting from a nearby cafe. The scent of roasting coffee beans mingled with the sweet perfume of exotic fruits, creating a heady aroma that Elina, despite having lived here all her life, never quite got used to.  A worn leather-bound notebook, crammed with handwritten facts and anecdotes, rested in her hand, her thumb tracing the embossed title: "Antigua: A Guide to the City of Eternal Spring." This morning's tour group, a motley collection of sunburnt tourists clutching cameras and water bottles, were due to arrive any minute. Elina adjusted the brim of her straw hat, a flicker of anticipation – and a touch of the usual pre-tour jitters – dancing in her dark eyes. This was her city, her passion, and she was ready to share its magic.
