The biting November wind whipped around Eliza Jane Thistlewick as she trudged across the frozen mud of the Yorkshire Wildlife Sanctuary.  Dawn hadn't yet cracked the sky, and the only illumination came from the swinging beam of her headlamp and the faint, ethereal glow of the approaching winter solstice.  The sanctuary, nestled in a secluded valley carved by the River Esk, was home to a motley crew of rescued creatures â€“ badgers with missing limbs, owls with damaged wings, foxes orphaned too young, and a particularly cantankerous three-legged deer named Colin.  Eliza Jane, bundled in layers of wool and waterproofs, inhaled the crisp air, the scent of pine and damp earth mingling with the faint, wild musk of her charges.  Today, her primary concern was Boris, the Eurasian lynx, who had been refusing food for two days, a worrying sign in the run-up to winter.
