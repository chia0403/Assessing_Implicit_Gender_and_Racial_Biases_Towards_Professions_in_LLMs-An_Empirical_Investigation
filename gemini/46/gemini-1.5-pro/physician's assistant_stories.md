The biting November wind whipped off Lake Superior, rattling the frosted panes of Dr. Elias Thorne's clinic and stinging Amelia Reyes’s cheeks.  The small town of Port Blossom, Minnesota, huddled against the coming winter, its brightly painted Victorian houses appearing even more vibrant against the steel-grey sky.  Inside, the waiting room was a haven of warmth, smelling faintly of antiseptic and the cinnamon-apple cider Amelia had brewed that morning.  She glanced at the clock – 4:55 pm. Five more minutes until the end of another long day, and Elias still hadn't emerged from his examination with Mrs. Henderson. Amelia, whose full name was Amelia Sofia Reyes, adjusted the stethoscope slung around her neck, a small knot of anxiety tightening in her stomach. Mrs. Henderson had been complaining of persistent chest pains, and Amelia's preliminary examination had revealed a concerning irregularity in her heartbeat. She hoped Elias was taking it seriously.  The clinic, the only one for miles, was their shared responsibility, a beacon of hope in this remote, windswept corner of the world. And today, that hope rested heavily on Amelia's shoulders.
