The fluorescent lights of Northwood High buzzed overhead, a monotonous soundtrack to Eleanor Vance’s Tuesday morning. Rain lashed against the window of her small, cluttered office, mirroring the tempest brewing in Eleanor’s stomach.  The aroma of stale coffee and the faint, lingering scent of teenage desperation clung to the air, a familiar blend she’d come to associate with the start of each week. Stacks of college applications threatened to avalanche from her desk, interspersed with brightly coloured pamphlets promising bright futures and lucrative careers.  Northwood, nestled in the heart of the economically depressed town of Havenwood, Oregon, wasn’t exactly a breeding ground for Ivy League dreams.  Most of Eleanor’s students hoped for a scholarship to the local community college, a pathway to a steady job at the lumber mill or the cannery, the twin pillars of Havenwood’s fragile economy. Today, however, Eleanor sensed something different, a shift in the stagnant air of predictability.  A scheduled meeting with a new student, a transfer from some undisclosed location, promised a disruption to the usual rhythm of academic anxieties and teenage melodrama.  And Eleanor, despite her churning stomach, found herself anticipating it.
