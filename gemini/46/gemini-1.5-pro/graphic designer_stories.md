Rain lashed against the oversized window of Amelia "Amy" Reyes's studio apartment, blurring the already fading neon glow of the Seattle skyline.  The rhythmic tap-tap-tap against the glass was a counterpoint to the frantic click-clack of her keyboard, a frantic race against a deadline she swore she'd meet with hours to spare.  Empty takeout containers littered her tiny workspace, a testament to three days fueled by lukewarm coffee and questionable pad thai. Amy, her usually vibrant magenta hair pulled back in a messy bun, squinted at the glowing screen, pushing stray curls from her tired eyes. Her apartment, perched above a bustling all-night laundromat in the vibrant, yet gritty, Ballard neighborhood, was usually a haven of organized chaos, a carefully curated blend of vintage finds and her own bold graphic designs. Tonight, however, it resembled a colorful, caffeine-fueled disaster zone. The air hung thick with the scent of printer ink and desperation.  This logo redesign for "Seattle Suds," a craft brewery opening just down the street, had to be perfect.  It was her biggest client yet, the one that could finally launch her from freelance obscurity to genuine design stardom.
