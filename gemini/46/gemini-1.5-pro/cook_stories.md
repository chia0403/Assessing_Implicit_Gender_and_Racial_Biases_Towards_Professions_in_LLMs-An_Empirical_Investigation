The clatter of pots and pans was a familiar lullaby to Elias Thorne.  He hummed along to the rhythmic clang, a counterpoint to the sizzling garlic and onions sweating in the cast iron pan before him.

Outside, the sky bled into shades of bruised purple and molten gold as the sun began its slow descent, painting the horizon in hues Elias often tried to capture in his curries.  Tonight's special was a Rendang Sapi, a slow-cooked beef stew simmering patiently on the back burner, a dish as complex and layered as the man who created it.
