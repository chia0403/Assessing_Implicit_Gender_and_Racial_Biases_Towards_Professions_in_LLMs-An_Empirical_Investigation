The mirrored wall of Studio Thrive shimmered, reflecting the pre-dawn glow filtering through the floor-to-ceiling windows.  A fine layer of condensation clung to the glass, a testament to the humid Miami morning. Inside, the air thrummed with anticipation, a low buzz of energy that preceded every 6:00 AM Spin & Sculpt class.  Eleanor Vance, her blonde ponytail swinging like a metronome, surveyed the room, her sharp blue eyes scanning the faces of her early-bird disciples.  Each spin bike was claimed, clip-in shoes clicking into pedals, water bottles sweating on the handlebars. The scent of coconut water and dry shampoo hung heavy in the air, a strangely comforting aroma that Eleanor had come to associate with the start of her day. Outside, the city was still waking, the rumble of delivery trucks a low murmur against the backdrop of the crashing waves just a few blocks away.  But here, in her sanctuary of sweat and self-improvement, Eleanorâ€™s day was already in full swing.
