The rain hammered against the bay window of Dr. Eleanor Vance’s office, blurring the already fading November light into a grey, watery mess.  Located on the third floor of a converted Victorian townhouse on Beacon Hill in Boston, the room was a comforting blend of professional and personal.  Deep crimson walls held diplomas and framed prints of calming landscapes, while a plush, teal velvet chaise lounge sat across from Eleanor’s worn leather wingback chair.  A small, crackling fire in the hearth fought back the encroaching chill, casting flickering shadows that danced across the intricate Persian rug.  Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, rattling the windowpanes and mirroring the growing unease that tightened in Eleanor’s chest.  She had a feeling this new patient, the one whose file currently lay open on her polished mahogany desk, was going to be…complicated.
