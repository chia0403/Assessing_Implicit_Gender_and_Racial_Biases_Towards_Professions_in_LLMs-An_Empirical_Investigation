The fluorescent lights of Dr. Anya Sharma's office hummed, a monotonous counterpoint to the rhythmic click-clack of her drill.  Dust motes danced in the pale beams, illuminating the sterile white walls and the chipped enamel of a particularly stubborn molar.  Outside, the city of Aethelgard bustled with the chaotic symphony of car horns and hurried footsteps, a stark contrast to the quiet, almost meditative, atmosphere of the dental chair.  Anya, a woman of thirty-two with eyes the color of warm honey and a smile that could charm a cavity, concentrated on the delicate work before her.  Her name, a blend of ancient Sanskrit and a nod to the strength of goddesses, felt almost too ornate for the mundane task of dentistry.  But then again, the mundane was where Anya excelled, where she found a peculiar kind of peace in the intricate details of a decaying tooth. The scent of antiseptic mingled with the faint perfume of jasmine she always carried.  Her small office, nestled in the heart of the city's historic district, felt like a haven, a refuge from the relentless pulse of the urban world.
