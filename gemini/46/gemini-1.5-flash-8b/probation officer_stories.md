Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the Probation Department, a relentless drumming that mirrored the relentless rhythm of Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's thoughts.  The chipped paint on the walls seemed to absorb the sound, as if the building itself was trying to swallow the anxieties swirling inside her.  The air in the small, cramped office hung thick with the smell of stale coffee and desperation.  A single fluorescent light buzzed overhead, casting an eerie, flickering glow on the overflowing file cabinet and the half-eaten granola bar nestled beside a stack of paperwork.  Amy, a probation officer with a worn leather briefcase and eyes that had seen too much, stared at the latest case file.  Her name, printed prominently in bold, was almost a mockery of the control she craved in her life.  The file detailed the repeated offences of her latest charge, a young man named Leo Vance, and the gnawing doubt began to creep into her resolve.  The setting was the grey, overcast metropolis of Ashwood, a city where the rain seemed to fall in sheets of despair, reflecting the melancholy that clung to its concrete canyons and shadowed alleyways.
