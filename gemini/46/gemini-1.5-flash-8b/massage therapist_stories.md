The humid air hung thick and heavy in the tiny, sun-drenched room, a fragrant tapestry woven from the scent of jasmine and sandalwood.  Sunlight, fractured by the patterned blinds, painted shifting, kaleidoscopic designs across the polished wooden floor.  Amelia Josephine Blackwood, her name a whispered secret amongst the hushed clientele of "Tranquil Tides Massage," adjusted the position of a plump, lavender-scented bolster.  A low hum of conversation, barely audible through the rhythmic whoosh of the air conditioner, drifted from the waiting area beyond the doorway.  Her hands, surprisingly still, despite the nervous tremor that danced beneath the surface, moved with practiced ease over the smooth, almost porcelain skin of her client.  Today, her client was a whirlwind of hushed expectations and barely-contained anxiety, a woman whose face, usually radiant, now bore the imprint of a recent sorrow.  The subtle shift in the womanâ€™s breath, the way her shoulders tightened ever so slightly, was the intricate language that Amelia, a skilled interpreter of unspoken tensions, was dedicated to deciphering.  The air in the room thrummed with a quiet anticipation.
