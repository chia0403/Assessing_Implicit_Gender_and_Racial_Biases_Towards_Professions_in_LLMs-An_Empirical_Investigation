The fluorescent hum of the server room vibrated through Amelia Rodriguez's shoes, a constant, low thrumming that felt almost like a heartbeat.  Rows upon rows of gleaming metal cabinets housed the nervous systems of the entire city â€“  financial transactions, traffic signals, power grids.  Amelia, a systems analyst with the Metropolitan Data Consortium, traced a finger along the cool, smooth surface of a rack, a small frown etching itself onto her brow.  The city's central hub, "Nexus," was showing inexplicable fluctuations in data throughput.  Tonight, the patterns were erratic, almost chaotic.  A single, almost imperceptible, spike in the graph for the south district's power grid had sparked a cascade of minor errors throughout the system. Small glitches were cascading, and if they weren't contained, they could ripple outwards, affecting everything from the city's subway system to the automated mail delivery network.

Setting: The cavernous server room of the Metropolitan Data Consortium, a sprawling complex nestled beneath the heart of Metro City.  Vast, echoing spaces filled with towering racks of servers, each a miniature universe of silicon and light.  The air was thick with the smell of ozone and the faint, metallic tang of old machinery.  A network of tangled cables, like a spider's web, crisscrossed the room, connecting the intricate network of the city's lifeblood.  Towering monitors, each a portal to the city's many systems, illuminated the space in a pulsating dance of data, with blinking lights, scrolling text, and jagged graphs.
