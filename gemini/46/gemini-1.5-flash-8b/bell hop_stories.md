The brass bell jingled a discordant, almost mournful, tune as Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield pushed it across the polished mahogany counter.  Dust motes, illuminated by the afternoon sun filtering through the stained-glass windows, danced in the air.  The Grand Imperial Hotel, a sprawling edifice of Victorian grandeur, breathed a quiet sigh of expectancy, the air thick with the scent of lilies and old leather.  Barty, a bell hop with eyes the colour of faded emerald green, adjusted his starched white uniform, a stark contrast to the shadowy corners of the hotel's vast lobby.  He'd been polishing brass doorknobs for hours, the rhythmic squeak a counterpoint to the distant rumble of carriages on the cobbled streets outside.  Today, however, the usual hum of activity seemed muted, a pre-storm stillness that prickled the hairs on his neck.  A single, rather large, travelling trunk sat in the corner, its leather embossed with a crest of intertwined serpents, the only sign of any significant arrival.
