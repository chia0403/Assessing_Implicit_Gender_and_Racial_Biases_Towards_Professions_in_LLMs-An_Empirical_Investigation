Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the dilapidated bodega, a relentless percussion that echoed the frantic rhythm in Amelia “Em” Kensington’s chest.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and something faintly chemical, clung to her like a second skin.  Outside, the city of Veridian, nestled in the foothills of the jagged Sierra Nevadas, hunkered down, its lights twinkling like scattered jewels in a turbulent sea.  This wasn't the glamorous, sun-drenched listings Em was accustomed to.  This was a fixer-upper of a different kind, a property whispered about in hushed tones by the locals, a property that whispered back.

Em, a real estate agent with a meticulously-maintained portfolio of high-end homes, found herself staring into the gloom of the bodega's single, flickering bulb.  The listing had promised "rustic charm," but the "charm" felt more like a lurking threat.  The property, a sprawling ranch house just outside Veridian’s tourist district, was infamous. Locals spoke of strange occurrences, of unexplained noises, of a past that clung to the stone walls like ivy. Em, the pragmatist, the one who always had a plan, found herself suddenly unnerved. Her tailored suit, usually a beacon of confidence, felt oddly ill-fitting in this atmosphere of unease.  She squinted, tracing the fading lines on the weathered map tacked to the wall.  The map showed a labyrinth of trails and hidden paths, leading deeper into the wilderness than she ever thought she'd venture.  This wasn't about a leaky roof or a crooked chimney; this was about uncovering a truth buried beneath the dust and decay.
