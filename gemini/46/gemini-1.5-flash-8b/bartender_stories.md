The flickering neon sign of the "Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow over Amelia Nightingale's shoulders.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of moonlight piercing the grime-coated window, illuminating the chipped paint and faded floral wallpaper of the back room.

Tonight, as usual, the only other patrons were a lone, perpetually scowling man nursing a whiskey, and a pair of gossiping women whose laughter echoed like wind chimes in a graveyard. Amelia, a wisp of a woman with eyes that held the melancholic depth of a forgotten well, expertly wiped down the sticky mahogany bar.  The year was 1929, and the city, though humming with a feverish energy, held a quiet unease that settled like a shroud around the small, dimly lit establishment.
