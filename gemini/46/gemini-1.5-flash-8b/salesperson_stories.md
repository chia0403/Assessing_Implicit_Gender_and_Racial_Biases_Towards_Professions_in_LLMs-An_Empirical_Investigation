The fluorescent lights of the "Gearhead Emporium" buzzed, a monotonous hum that vibrated through Elara Vance's weary bones.  Dust motes danced in the sickly yellow light, mirroring the swirling confusion in her head.  Another Tuesday, another graveyard shift, another mountain of unsold, overpriced gadgets.  The Emporium, a sprawling warehouse filled with gleaming chrome and blinking lights, was supposed to be a beacon of cutting-edge technology;  in Elara's experience, it was more akin to a gilded cage of disappointment.

Elara Vance, twenty-eight, a sales associate with a penchant for dystopian novels and a soul made of polished granite, stared at the latest iteration of the "Chronosyncro" wristwatch.  Its sleek titanium band,  etched with intricate, almost alien patterns, felt strangely cold against her palm.  The Chronosyncro, according to the brochure, was the ultimate time-management tool, a device that could reorder your schedule to eliminate wasted minutes and maximize productivity.  But Elara had seen countless disappointed customers leave the Emporium, wallets heavier with debt and spirits lighter with skepticism.  This week, a particularly pungent aroma of burnt coffee hovered in the air, the result of another frustrated customer who was convinced their broken time-travel backpack was covered by warranty.

The setting:  A vast, cavernous warehouse in the forgotten industrial district of Neo-Veridia.  Steel girders crisscrossed the ceiling, casting long shadows.  Stacks of cardboard boxes overflowed with technology, ranging from esoteric gadgets to mundane appliances.  A rhythmic clatter of machinery emanated from the back, lost in the drone of the fluorescent lights.   The air, though thick with the scent of unidentifiable plastics, was subtly perfumed with an overly-sweet, artificial "future-tech" fragrance.
