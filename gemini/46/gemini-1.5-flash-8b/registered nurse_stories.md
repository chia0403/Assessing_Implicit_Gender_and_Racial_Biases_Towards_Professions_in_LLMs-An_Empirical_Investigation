The fluorescent lights of the emergency room hummed, a relentless, almost sentient drone that seemed to vibrate through Amelia "Amy" Carterâ€™s very bones.  The sterile, antiseptic smell clung to the air, a suffocating blanket woven from disinfectant and the faint, metallic tang of blood.  Outside, the city thrummed with a restless energy that mirrored the chaotic symphony unfolding within the walls of St. Jude's Hospital.  Amy, a registered nurse with ten years of experience, stood at the head of a gurney, her hands hovering over the lifeless form of a young man.  His eyes, wide and vacant, stared blankly at the ceiling, mirroring the terrifying emptiness that gnawed at her.  The room, usually a flurry of activity, was momentarily still, a hushed anticipation hanging heavy in the air as the team waited for the arrival of the attending physician.  The beeping of heart monitors and the rhythmic thump-thump of the defibrillator were the only sounds that broke the silence.  This was just another night in the emergency room, another life hanging precariously in the balance.
