The biting wind whipped at Amelia "Maisie"  Kingston's fluorescent orange safety vest, stinging her cheeks as she surveyed the desolate stretch of I-95.  Sunrise painted the eastern sky in hues of bruised purple and bruised peach, barely piercing the thick, grey blanket of pre-dawn fog.  Maisie, her breath puffing white in the frigid air, adjusted the worn brim of her ball cap.  The highway, a ribbon of asphalt snaking through the pine barrens, felt endless, a vast, featureless expanse reflecting the emptiness in her heart.  It was her tenth consecutive day working the graveyard shift on this notoriously accident-prone section, a stretch of road notorious for its treacherous curves and relentless fog.  This particular stretch, between Exit 28 and Exit 32, had become a personal purgatory for Maisie, a place where the relentless monotony of the job bled into the fabric of her life, leaving her feeling profoundly adrift.


The setting was a desolate stretch of I-95, just north of the New Jersey shore, somewhere between the sleepy towns of Long Beach and Seabrook. The highway winds through a landscape of pine forests and marshlands, the fog clinging to the low-lying areas like a spectral shroud.  The air, thick with the smell of damp earth and pine needles, carried a constant chill, even in the pre-dawn hours.  Small, faded signs marking abandoned roadside businesses and forgotten motel entrances punctuated the landscape, adding to the overall sense of isolation.  Across the highway, a single, unlit motel sign flickered faintly â€“ a lonely beacon in the encroaching darkness.
