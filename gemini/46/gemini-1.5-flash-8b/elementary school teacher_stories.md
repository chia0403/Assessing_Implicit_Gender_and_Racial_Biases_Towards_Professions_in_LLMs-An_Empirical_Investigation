The fluorescent lights of Miss Amelia Butterfield's third-grade classroom hummed, a relentless, almost hypnotic drone.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grime-streaked windowpane, illuminating a scene of controlled chaos.  Crayon shavings littered the desks, meticulously arranged alphabet charts leaned precariously against the chipped paint, and the air, thick with the scent of glue and unidentifiable, slightly sweet, childish smells, hung heavy.  This was Ameliaâ€™s sanctuary, her battlefield, and her daily battleground was often fought with the quiet, persistent whisper of frustration.  The rhythmic tap-tap-tap of a pencil echoed in the otherwise still room, a counterpoint to the almost imperceptible sigh of a small hand-drawn unicorn, meticulously detailed with iridescent glitter glue.


Amelia Butterfield, a woman whose weathered cardigan and perpetually tired eyes belied a fierce and dedicated spirit, was in the midst of a particularly trying lesson on the parts of a flower.  Her class, a colorful mix of curious, creative, and occasionally disruptive individuals, was, as usual, proving to be a lively and perplexing study in contrasts.
