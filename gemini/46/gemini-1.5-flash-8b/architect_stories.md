The biting wind, a relentless sculptor, whipped Amelia Nightingale's hair across her face as she stared up at the skeletal framework of the abandoned lighthouse.  Sea spray, thick with salt and the ghosts of forgotten storms, stung her cheeks.  Below, the churning grey waters of the North Sea crashed against the jagged rocks, a symphony of relentless fury.

Amelia Nightingale, architect extraordinary, stood on the precipice of a new project, a new challenge that promised to be both exhilarating and terrifying.
