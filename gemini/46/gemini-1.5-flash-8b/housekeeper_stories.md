The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual dull grey, reflected the pale light filtering through the grime-coated windowpanes of Number 17 Plum Street.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of sunlight, illuminating a faint, almost imperceptible layer of spiderwebs clinging to the faded floral wallpaper.  This was the world of Agnes Periwinkle, housekeeper extraordinaire, or at least that's what the residents of Number 17 claimed, their voices echoing through the narrow, echoing hallway as they scurried to their morning meetings.  Agnes, a woman whose hands, despite their tireless work, held a quiet grace, meticulously scrubbed at the stubborn grime, a silent symphony of squeaks and creaks her only company.  The rhythmic clatter of her mop echoing through the empty rooms spoke volumes, not of chaos, but of meticulous order.  Today, however, the rhythm was disturbed. A faint, metallic tang lingered in the air, a strange scent unfamiliar to the usually predictable aroma of stale coffee and old books. This morning, something was amiss.
