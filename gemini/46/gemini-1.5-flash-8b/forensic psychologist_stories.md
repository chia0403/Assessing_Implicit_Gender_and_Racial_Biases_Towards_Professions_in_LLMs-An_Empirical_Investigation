Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the abandoned warehouse, a relentless tattoo echoing the frantic rhythm in Dr. Eleanor Vance's head.  The air, thick with the scent of mildew and something vaguely metallic, clung to her like a shroud.  This wasn't the sterile, antiseptic environment of the university's forensic psychology lab; this was the scene of a crime, a crime shrouded in an unnerving silence, a silence punctuated only by the drumming rain.  Dr. Eleanor Vance, a forensic psychologist specializing in trauma-induced behavioral shifts, crouched beside a pool of dried blood that stained the concrete floor a disturbing shade of crimson.  The smell of bleach, starkly contrasting with the putrid air, was strangely comforting.


Setting:

The abandoned warehouse, nestled on the outskirts of the industrial district of Blackwood, was a testament to forgotten dreams and broken promises.  Once a bustling hub for manufacturing, it now stood as a decaying husk, its rusted machinery and shattered windows reflecting the encroaching darkness of a post-industrial landscape.  Broken pallets littered the floor, their splintered wood offering a skeletal landscape of past activity.  The smell of decay and the echoing rain underscored the bleakness of the scene, a fitting backdrop for the disturbing truth hidden within its decaying walls.  The overall environment spoke to a sense of isolation and abandonment, a feeling that amplified the eerie calm that settled over Dr. Vance.
