The fluorescent lights of the "Corner Grocer" hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic clatter of Amelia Rose Thornton's fingers against the worn plastic of the cash register.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grime-coated window, illuminating a scattering of half-eaten pastries and forgotten shopping baskets.  Amelia, a lanky woman with perpetually tired eyes and a smile that seemed permanently etched in a weary frown, stared at the flickering digital display.  Another Tuesday, another tedious loop of transactions.  Today's soundtrack was the same old, same old â€“ the frustrated sigh of an elderly woman returning a bruised avocado, the impatient tap-tap-tap of a teenager's phone, the murmured complaints about the price of organic kale.


Amelia was a cashier.  More accurately, Amelia was a Corner Grocer cashier.  The only difference, she often mused, between this space and the inside of a cold, sterile supermarket was the distinct aroma of stale coffee, decaying fruit, and the faint, sweet scent of old sugar.  Every Monday through Saturday, Amelia traded the quiet solitude of her tiny apartment for this quiet cacophony, for this small, contained world where the only drama was the daily struggle against the relentless march of the clock and the unyielding predictability of grocery shopping.
