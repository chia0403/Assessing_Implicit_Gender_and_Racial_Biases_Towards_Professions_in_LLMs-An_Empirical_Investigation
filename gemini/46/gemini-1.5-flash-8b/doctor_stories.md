The biting November wind whipped through the gaps in the crumbling stone walls of the Blackwood Manor, carrying with it the scent of pine and something acrid, something almost metallic.  Dr. Alistair Finch, a man whose face, etched with the lines of countless sleepless nights and the weight of too many whispered secrets, shivered despite his thick woolen coat.  He adjusted the worn leather satchel on his shoulder, its contents a jumble of instruments and vials, each one a silent promise of healing, or at least, temporary reprieve.  The manor itself, looming darkly against the bruised twilight sky, seemed to exhale a silent threat, its overgrown gardens choked with shadows and whispered rumours.  Alistair, though, knew better than to let fear dictate his actions. He was a man of science, a man of medicine, and he was here to confront whatever darkness resided within its walls.

The setting: Blackwood Manor, a sprawling gothic estate perched atop a windswept hill overlooking a valley shrouded in mist.  The manor itself was a monument to decaying grandeur, its stonework scarred by time and neglect.  Thickets of gnarled trees clawed at the oppressive grey sky. Inside, the air hung heavy with the scent of dust and forgotten things.  The entire atmosphere felt thick with unspoken history and the weight of secrets.
