The fluorescent lights of the "Tax-Free Zone" hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia Blackwood's life.  Dust motes danced in the pale glow, mirroring the swirling thoughts in her head.  Amelia, a meticulous income tax preparer with a penchant for perfectly organized folders and even more perfectly sharpened pencils, stared at the mountain of paperwork on her desk.  It wasn't the sheer volume that stressed her, but the sheer *mess*.  A chaotic jumble of receipts, W-2s, 1099s, and questionable expense reports.  This was Tuesday, the busiest day of the tax season, and already the whispers of impending doom, the whispers of late filings and irate clients, echoed in her ears.  The Tax-Free Zone was located in a nondescript office park on the outskirts of Anytown, a place where the only excitement came from the occasional delivery truck and the predictable rhythm of the town's daily grind.  The park itself was a testament to the quiet efficiency that had become Ameliaâ€™s life.  Rows of identical, beige buildings with indistinguishable windows stretched as far as the eye could see, each likely housing businesses that churned out the very numbers Amelia was desperately trying to decipher.   This Tuesday, though, seemed unusually fraught with anxiety.
