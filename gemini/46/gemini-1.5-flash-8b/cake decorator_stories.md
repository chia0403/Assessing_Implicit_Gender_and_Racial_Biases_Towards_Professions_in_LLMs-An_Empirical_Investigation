The air hung thick with the scent of buttercream and sugared almonds, a heady perfume that swirled around Amelia Rose Hawthorne like a protective, sugary fog.  Her workshop, tucked away on a cobbled lane just off the bustling market square of Alderbrook, was a haven of pastel hues and intricate designs.  Sunlight, filtered through stained-glass windows depicting fantastical creatures, painted rainbows across the tiered cake stands, illuminating the tiny, almost invisible details Amelia was painstakingly crafting.  Today's commission was particularly daunting: a life-sized replica of the Alderbrook Cathedral spire, its intricate stonework painstakingly rendered in marzipan, meant to celebrate the annual Ascension Festival.  Amelia, a woman with hands that seemed to possess an almost magical understanding of sugar and icing, felt a knot of anxiety tighten in her chest.  This cake wasn't just another commission; it was a test.  A test of her skill, her patience, and perhaps, her very sanity.
