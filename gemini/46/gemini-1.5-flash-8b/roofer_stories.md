Below, the sprawling Victorian mansions of Blackwood Manor lined the cobbled street, their opulent facades a stark contrast to the grime clinging to the rooftops Elias painstakingly repaired.  Each slate, chipped and worn, seemed to whisper tales of Blackwood's illustrious past, tales Elias, in his own quiet way, was preserving.  He was a roofer, not a historian, but the weight of the past seemed to settle on the aged timbers of the houses as much as the heavy slates.  He adjusted his worn tool belt, the familiar clink of the copper nails against the iron work a comforting rhythm in the relentless wind. Blackwood Manor, the largest and most ornate of the properties, loomed over him, a gothic silhouette against the bruised sky.  A single, almost defiant, crow perched precariously on the highest point of the steep gable end, its beady eye fixed on Elias.
