The biting November wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks like shards of ice.  Below, the cobbled streets of Prague shimmered under a bruised sky, the colours muted by the approaching dusk.  Towering above, the spires of St. Vitus Cathedral, normally majestic, seemed to press down, heavy with the imminence of the storm.  Amelia, her chestnut hair pulled back from her face, adjusted her worn leather satchel and scanned the small group of tourists huddled around her.  They were a disparate collection: a gaggle of giggling teenagers from Japan, a middle-aged couple from Arizona with sun-kissed skin and weary eyes, a lone, bookish teenager from London with a worn copy of "The Prague Cemetery" clutched in his hand.

Amelia, a self-proclaimed "Prague Whisperer," was in her element.  The city, with its centuries of history whispering from every stone, felt like a living organism.  Tonight, she was leading her group on a "Secrets of the Old Town" tour, a journey through hidden alleys and forgotten courtyards. Her job was to weave together the dry facts of the past with the palpable essence of the present.  The stories, like the city's architecture, were meant to be explored, not simply heard.  Tonight, however, a particular story felt unusually resonant, resonating with an unspoken urgency in the quiet hush that had fallen over the group.
