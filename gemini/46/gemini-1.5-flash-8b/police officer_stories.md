Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the precinct, mimicking the relentless drumming in Detective Isabella "Izzy" Diaz's head.  The flickering fluorescent lights of the small town of Havenwood, nestled deep within the Appalachian foothills, cast long, distorted shadows across the cramped interrogation room.  The air hung thick with the smell of pine needles and something faintly metallic, a lingering scent that clung to the damp walls like a shroud.  Izzy, her trench coat soaked and clinging to her, stared at the suspect, a gaunt man named Silas Blackwood, whose haunted eyes reflected the stormy night outside.  Havenwood, usually a picture of quiet rural serenity, was tonight a stage for a drama of violence and fear, a drama that Izzy felt she was desperately failing to unravel.  The case, a brutal stabbing that left a local farmer, Mr. Harmon, dead, was more than just another file; it was a knot tightening around the already strained fabric of the town's peace, and Izzy was the only one who seemed to feel the pressure, the unseen weight of its consequences.
