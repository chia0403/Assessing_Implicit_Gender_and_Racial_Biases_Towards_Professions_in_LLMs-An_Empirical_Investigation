The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual, faded rose, reflected Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's weary face.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight piercing the gloom of his tiny shop, "The Clipper's Edge."  Cobwebs, thick as spun sugar, draped themselves across the dusty mirrors, catching the amber light like spectral lace.  A faint aroma of lavender and something vaguely metallic – perhaps old blood – hung heavy in the air, a familiar companion to the rhythmic snip-snip of Barty's shears.  He was a barber in the fading heart of Oakhaven, a town nestled amongst ancient, whispering pines, where time seemed to have lost its brisk pace and settled into a slumberous sigh.  The chipped paint of the shop's facade, once a cheerful cream, was now a patchwork of faded colour, mirroring the chipped hope within Barty's own heart.
