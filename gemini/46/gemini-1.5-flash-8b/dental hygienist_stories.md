The fluorescent lights of Dr. Aris Thorne's office hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Elara Nightingale's afternoon.  Elara, a dental hygienist with a perpetually tired smile and eyes that held the glint of hidden stories, meticulously polished a patient's teeth.  The antiseptic smell of chlorhexidine hung heavy in the air, punctuated by the rhythmic click-click-click of her instruments.  Outside, the bustling city of Newhaven thrummed with life, a stark contrast to the sterile, quiet sanctuary of the dental practice nestled in a quiet side street.  This particular afternoon, though, a different kind of energy vibrated within Elara – an unsettling, almost palpable unease that had nothing to do with the usual dental anxieties.  It was the kind of unease that crept in the spaces between thoughts, a whisper of something out of place.

Elara’s office, a small but perfectly organized space, was a testament to her meticulous nature.  A pristine white countertop held rows of gleaming instruments.  Framed posters of healthy smiles and dental health tips lined the walls, but they felt somehow…unreal today.  The faint scent of lavender-scented hand soap, normally soothing, was a grating reminder of the sterile environment.  The worn, slightly faded floral wallpaper, a relic from the office's previous occupant, offered a touch of the past, a gentle reminder of a time when the office felt less…strangely expectant. This, she thought, couldn't be good.
