The greasy haze clung to the air in "Rusty Wrench," a cramped auto repair shop tucked beneath the shadow of the towering, rust-eaten Skybridge.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight slicing through the grimy window, illuminating a tangle of wrenches, spark plugs, and half-dismantled engines.  Elias Thorne, a lanky mechanic with calloused hands and eyes that held the wisdom of a thousand broken transmissions, leaned over a sputtering, vintage Mustang.  The car, nicknamed "Eleanor" by its previous owner, sat on a wobbly lift, its once-vibrant crimson paint now dulled and faded.  Elias traced a finger along a chipped paint-flecked fender, a faint frown etching itself onto his brow.  The engine's relentless cough was the only sound in the cavernous space, punctuated occasionally by the rhythmic clang of a hammer against metal. Outside, the city throbbed with the relentless hum of traffic, a symphony Elias knew intimately. He was an architect of silent power, a sorcerer of metal and fire.  But this particular engine, this stubborn Eleanor, was defying him.  Today, even the city's relentless energy couldn't mask the whisper of something amiss beneath the hood.
