The fluorescent lights of the truck stop hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic thump-thump of Jasper "Jax" Blackwood's heart.  He hadn't felt this unsettled since the night heâ€™d pulled over in Dustbowl, Arizona, a decade ago, and found his best friend,  Dusty, slumped against a broken beer keg.  Now, parked in the sterile, beige expanse of the "Highway Haven" truck stop, the air thick with the smell of stale coffee and diesel fumes, Jax felt the familiar knot tighten in his stomach.  The shimmering heat haze rising from the asphalt outside mirrored the shimmering uncertainty within him.  

**Setting:**

The year is 2024.  Highway Haven Truck Stop, situated smack-dab in the middle of the endless, sun-baked expanse of Interstate 40, somewhere between Amarillo and Oklahoma City.  The stop itself is a monument to fleeting moments and weary souls.  Checkered floors, stained with years of spilled coffee and greasy takeout, reflect the worn-out existence of the long-haul truckers who call it home, at least for a few hours.  Empty trucker hats, forgotten mugs, and half-eaten diner plates litter the surfaces.  Outside, the highway stretches out like a concrete ribbon, swallowing the passing trucks into its endless journey.
