The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Numbers & Nuggets" accounting firm hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Amelia Peabody's fingers on her keyboard.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grimy window, illuminating a swirling vortex of receipts, invoices, and crumpled paperclips on her desk.  Amelia, a bookkeeper with a penchant for meticulous order and a perpetual frown that hinted at a battle fought and won with a particularly stubborn spreadsheet, stared blankly at the endless columns of figures.  It was a Tuesday, the same as any other, except this Tuesday feltâ€¦ off.  Not wrong, exactly, but weighted, as if a single, unseen object lay heavily in the balance of the ledger she was meticulously scrutinizing.

The office itself was a study in muted beige and industrial practicality.  Filing cabinets, overflowing with decades of paper, lined the walls like silent sentinels.  The air smelled of stale coffee, old paper, and the faint, almost imperceptible scent of lavender from a forgotten floral arrangement that inexplicably graced a corner desk.  A single, enormous potted fern, its leaves drooping slightly, stood guard over the center of the room, a silent witness to countless late nights and early mornings spent wrestling with numbers and deadlines.  Beyond the office walls, the bustling city of Aethelgard whispered its frantic symphony of car horns and construction noises.  Amelia, however, existed in a quiet bubble of numbers, a world detached yet intricately connected to the rhythm of the outside world.
