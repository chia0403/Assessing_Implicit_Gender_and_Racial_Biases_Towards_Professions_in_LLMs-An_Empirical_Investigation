The scent of jasmine, a heady, almost cloying perfume, hung heavy in the air of "Blooms by Beatrice," a small, sun-drenched shop nestled between a bustling bakery and a hushed antique bookstore.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron awning, a relentless drumming that mirrored the frantic rhythm of Beatrice Nightingale's heart.  The year was 1928, and a tremor of uncertainty, palpable in the humid London air, hung like a damp shroud over the city.  Beatrice, a young woman with eyes the colour of a stormy sea and hair the shade of midnight, meticulously arranged a cluster of vibrant tulips â€“ scarlet, orange, and a deep, almost impossible violet.  Each blossom, a small, defiant act of beauty against the encroaching grey.
