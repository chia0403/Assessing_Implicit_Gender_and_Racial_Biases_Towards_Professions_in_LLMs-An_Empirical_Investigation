The fluorescent lights of the Sterling & Stone law firm hummed, a monotonous drone that echoed the rhythm of Amelia Kensington’s life.  Filing cabinets, lined like silent sentinels, stretched into the dim recesses of the reception area.  A single, overly-bright potted fern wilted pathetically in a corner, mirroring the withering hope Amelia felt for her own career path.  Today, the floral arrangement on the mahogany desk was a particularly jarring bouquet of crimson roses—a stark contrast to the muted greys and browns of the office.  Amelia, a slender woman with perpetually tired eyes and a cascade of dark auburn hair usually tied back in a practical bun, stared at the latest stack of legal documents.  Another day, another mountain of paperwork.

The Sterling & Stone firm, a prestigious but surprisingly stuffy law practice located in a neoclassical building on the corner of Elm and Oak Streets, exuded an aura of quiet power.  Sunlight, filtered through the tall, arched windows, painted long shadows across the polished marble floors.  The scent of aged leather and expensive perfume hung heavy in the air, a scent Amelia had come to associate with deadlines, hushed whispers, and the faint, metallic tang of courtroom drama.  Each morning, as she greeted the steady stream of clients and lawyers, a chorus of crisp suits and polished shoes, Amelia felt a sense of detachment, a quiet observer in a world she longed to understand but couldn't quite grasp.
