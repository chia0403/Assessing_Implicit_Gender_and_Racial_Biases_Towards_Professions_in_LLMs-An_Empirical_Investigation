The chipped porcelain sink in Amelia Blackwood's tiny salon, "Scissors & Whispers," reflected the afternoon sun in fractured shards of gold.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom of the dusty, barely-lit space.  The air hung thick with the scent of faded lavender and something vaguely metallic, perhaps old hairspray or the remnants of a forgotten lunch.  Amelia, her name whispered on the soft breeze that slipped through the grimy window, meticulously trimmed a strand of auburn hair, the rhythmic snip-snip echoing in the near-silence.  Her hands, calloused but precise, were the only active elements in the otherwise still room.  Her gaze, focused on the strand, held a depth that belied the mundane task.  Outside, the city roared – a symphony of sirens and distant traffic – but inside "Scissors & Whispers", time seemed to crawl, measured only by the rhythmic fall of the shears.
