The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Apothecary's Corner" hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *click-clack* of Amelia Blackwood's nimble fingers as she sorted vials of potent herbs.  Dust motes danced in the pale glow, illuminating the intricate carvings on the antique mahogany shelves that lined the walls, each a silent testament to generations of healers.  The air, thick with the scent of lavender and sandalwood, mingled with the faint, almost imperceptible aroma of something metallic â€“ something unnatural.  Amelia, her dark hair pulled back in a tight bun, frowned slightly.  It was a scent she hadn't encountered before in the fifteen years she'd tended this small, but revered, apothecary.

Amelia Blackwood, pharmacist extraordinaire and resident enigma of the quiet village of Oakhaven, was a woman sculpted from shadows and starlight.  Her eyes, the color of stormy seas, held a depth that hinted at countless forgotten remedies and whispered secrets.  Oakhaven itself was a picturesque village nestled deep within a valley, shrouded by ancient oak trees that seemed to reach out and touch the sky.  The village, while peaceful, felt perpetually poised on the edge of something extraordinary, something just beyond the veil of everyday life.  The stream that wound its way through the heart of the village, usually babbling merrily, now ran a sluggish, almost ominous, current, its waters stained an unsettling shade of ochre.  The air was unusually still, heavy with the cloying scent of damp earth and a strange, metallic tang. Something was amiss.
