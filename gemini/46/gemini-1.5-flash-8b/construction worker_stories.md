The biting wind whipped across the exposed steel framework of the skyscraper, stinging Elias Thorne's cheeks.  Dust, kicked up by the passing trucks, swirled around him like a miniature tornado, obscuring the already hazy cityscape.  He gripped the scaffolding railing, the cold metal a stark contrast to the sweat clinging to his brow.  Below, the city sprawled out – a tapestry of shimmering glass and steel, a stark reminder of the ambition that drove him, the ambition that had brought him to this perilous height.  

Elias Thorne, a seasoned construction worker with calloused hands and eyes that held the weary wisdom of countless nights spent battling the elements, surveyed the scene.  The skyscraper, christened "The Zenith," was nearing completion.  Almost. Just another week, another batch of pre-cast panels to install, and then… he could finally take a breath.

He was perched high above the bustling construction site of the downtown district of New Zenith City, a gleaming metropolis built on the ruins of what was once a sprawling forest.  The air, thick with the smell of concrete, iron, and distant exhaust, was punctuated by the constant symphony of construction machinery – the rhythmic clang of hammers, the roar of cranes, and the deep hum of generators. Below, the workers moved with the meticulous efficiency of trained ants.
