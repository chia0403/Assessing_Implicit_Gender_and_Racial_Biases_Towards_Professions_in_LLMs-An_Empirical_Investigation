The biting wind whipped Amelia Nightingale's shawl around her as she surveyed the sprawling aviary.  Sunrise painted the frosted panes of the conservatory a bruised purple, a stark contrast to the vibrant hues of the macaws squawking their morning greetings from perches high above.  Amelia, Animal Caretaker at the Whispering Pines Sanctuary, had been working at the sanctuary since she was old enough to lift a bucket of birdseed.  The sanctuary, nestled in the heart of the whispering pines, a dense forest that clung to the jagged mountain peaks of the Whispering Hills, was her life, her sanctuary.  For Amelia, the rustling leaves, the chirping of unseen creatures, and the gentle cooing of the doves were more comforting than the most elaborate symphony. Each creature, from the grumpy tortoises to the mischievous monkeys, held a unique story, and she felt a deep connection to them all. This morning, though, a different sort of silence hung heavy in the air, a stillness that unnerved her more than the usual pre-dawn chaos.  A strange stillness, a disconcerting emptiness.
