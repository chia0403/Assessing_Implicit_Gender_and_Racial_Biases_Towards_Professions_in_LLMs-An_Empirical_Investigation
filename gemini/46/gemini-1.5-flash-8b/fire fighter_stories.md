The air, thick with the metallic tang of ozone and the acrid smell of burning plastic, hung heavy in the narrow alleyway.  Dust motes danced in the flickering light from the emergency lights of the responding fire trucks, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to writhe with the same frenetic energy as the flames devouring the third-floor apartment. Em, her face etched with the grim determination of years spent battling urban infernos, gripped the battered metal of the ladder, her knuckles white.  The brick walls of the alley groaned under the relentless assault of the inferno, and the heat radiated off the buildings like a living entity.

The setting was the sprawling metropolis of New Zenith, a city built on skyscrapers that clawed at the sky and narrow alleys that wound through its concrete canyons.  The incessant rhythm of sirens, punctuated by the sharp crackle of flames and the agonizing screams that echoed from the upper floors, painted the scene.  Tonight, it was the dilapidated apartment complex nestled between the towering financial district and the trendy entertainment sector.  The old buildings, with their peeling paint and broken windows, seemed to absorb the flames, amplifying the intensity of the blaze, a tragic spectacle against the backdrop of a city that never truly slept.
