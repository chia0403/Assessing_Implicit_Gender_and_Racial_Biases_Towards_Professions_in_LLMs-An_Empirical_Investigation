The biting wind, a relentless sculptor itself, whipped across the jagged peaks of the Arkanian Mountains, stinging Elara Stonehand's cheeks.  Dust, fine as powdered amethyst, swirled around her, coating the already grey-blue granite of the quarry with a veil of oblivion.  The air hung thick with the scent of pine needles and the metallic tang of iron, a constant companion to her life in the heart of the K'Tharr Valley.  Elara Stonehand, a stone cutter of renowned skill, but haunted by an unseen force, worked under a sky the colour of bruised plums.

The quarry, a gaping maw in the mountainside, echoed with the rhythmic clang of her hammer against the stone.  Sunlight, fractured and fleeting, illuminated the vast, grey expanse, casting long, dancing shadows that stretched and twisted like the very sinews of the mountains themselves.  Huge blocks of granite, raw and untamed, lay scattered around her, their rough surfaces testament to the relentless work of millennia.  Here, amidst the towering, silent giants, Elara carved her existence, one painstaking chip at a time.
