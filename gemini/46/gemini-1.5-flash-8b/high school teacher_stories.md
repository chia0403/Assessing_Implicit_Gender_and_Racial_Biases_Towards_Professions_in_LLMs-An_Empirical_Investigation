The chipped Formica tabletop of Mrs. Eleanor Vance's classroom buzzed with the low hum of teenage anticipation.  Sunlight, fractured through the grime-coated windows of the dilapidated Southside High, painted shifting patterns on the worn floor.  Dust motes danced in the air, illuminated by the fluorescent lights flickering with the erratic rhythm of the school's aging infrastructure.  This was Mrs. Vance's third year teaching tenth-grade English at Southside, and this particular Monday morning felt like the same old, tired song.  The same whispers about who was dating who, the same sighs of boredom, the same restless shuffling of feet. But this Monday, a single, unexpected bloom of something different stirred in the air, a subtle change in the usual cacophony. A change that resonated deep within Mrs. Vance, too.  She felt it in the way the humid air hung thick and heavy, in the way the smell of old books and stale coffee clung to the space, in the way the familiar faces were suddenly less predictable. This time, it felt different.  This time, something was about to crack open.
