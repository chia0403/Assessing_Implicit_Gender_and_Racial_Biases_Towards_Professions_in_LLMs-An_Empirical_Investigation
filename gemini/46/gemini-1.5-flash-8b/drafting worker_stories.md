The fluorescent lights of the drafting room hummed, a relentless, almost hypnotic drone that echoed the rhythmic scratching of pencils against paper.  Dust motes danced in the solitary shaft of sunlight piercing the grime-coated window, illuminating the intricate lines of blueprints spread across  Elias Thorne's drafting table. Elias Thorne, twenty-seven, a drafting worker at the sprawling, perpetually-grey Atlas Construction Company, felt the familiar weight of responsibility settle on his shoulders.

A complex system of tunnels and arches, it demanded meticulous attention to detail, a level of precision that often felt impossible to maintain in the suffocating atmosphere of the room.  His fingers, stained a dull orange from years of graphite, hovered over the intricate diagram of a keystone, each line a testament to the tireless dedication of countless draughtsmen before him.  The room, perpetually cool and smelling faintly of stale coffee and old paper, felt a pressure, a palpable tension that mirrored the immense weight of the project itself.
