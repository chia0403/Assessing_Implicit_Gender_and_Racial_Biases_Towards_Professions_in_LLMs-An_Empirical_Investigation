The chipped porcelain sink, stained a sickly yellow from decades of lukewarm water and spilled bleach, reflected Bartholomew "Barty" Finch's weary face.  He ran a hand through the unruly wisps of grey hair that escaped his faded green cap, the remnants of a particularly stubborn dandelion clinging to his thumb.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, hung heavy in the little maintenance shed that served as Barty Finch's kingdom – the kingdom of  Evergreen Manor.

Evergreen Manor.  A sprawling, ivy-clad estate perched precariously on a hill overlooking the town of Oakhaven.  Years ago, it had been a vibrant showcase of opulent living, its gardens renowned throughout the county. Now, however, the grandeur was fading, like the paint on the weathered woodwork of the greenhouse windows, and the manicured lawns were showing their age. Barty, the estate's groundskeeper for the past twenty-five years, was the last vestige of that past glory, the quiet guardian of a dying dream.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom, illuminating the half-eaten apple core on the workbench.  A faint, mournful melody drifted from the overgrown rose garden beyond the shed – a sorrowful tune played by an unseen wind instrument, perhaps the last gasp of a forgotten symphony.  Barty sighed, another day, another faded bloom, another whisper of the estate's fading elegance.
