The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the cobblestones of Montmartre, painting the already-dim alleyway in hues of bruised purple and flickering orange.  Rain, a relentless curtain, hammered against the corrugated iron awning of the "Whispering Siren," the only visible sign of life in the otherwise deserted passage.  Inside, huddled around a rickety wooden table, sat Isolde Nightingale, her voice a fragile, almost imperceptible melody echoing in the damp air.  Isolde, with her raven hair escaping from a threadbare shawl, was a wisp of a woman, her eyes, the colour of storm clouds, reflecting the swirling tempest outside.  Her fingers, delicate and nimble, traced the worn ivory keys of a battered piano, coaxing from it a melancholic tune, a lament for a love lost and a future shrouded in uncertainty.  Tonight, the only audience for her performance was the relentless downpour and the silent, shadowed figures lurking in the alley's deepest recesses.
