The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Reliable Reinsurance" office hummed a monotonous tune, punctuated by the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Amelia  "Amy"  Fairweather's fingers on her keyboard.  Rain hammered against the grimy, double-paned windows, mirroring the relentless drumming of deadlines echoing in her head.  Today, October 27th, 2024, felt like an especially punishing downpour.  The air, thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, hung heavy in the small, windowless office tucked away on a side street in the burgeoning, yet perpetually grey, industrial district of  Newhaven.  Amelia, a petite woman with perpetually tired eyes and a will of steel, hunched over her workstation, her brow furrowed in concentration as she reviewed the latest batch of policy applications.  Newhaven, a city built on the back of factories and forgotten promises, felt as if it were holding its breath, awaiting the next storm.
