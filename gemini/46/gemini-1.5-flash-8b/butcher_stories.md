The chill of the pre-dawn air, thick with the scent of damp earth and woodsmoke, clung to Bartholomew "Barty" Grimshaw like a second skin.  He pulled the heavy, leather-bound apron tighter around his waist, the familiar weight grounding him against the approaching gloom.  The cobblestone street of Oakhaven, normally a symphony of early morning noises – the clinking of milk cans, the barking of dogs, the rhythmic thud of a blacksmith's hammer – was eerily silent.  Only the whisper of the wind through the ancient, gnarled oaks lining the lane punctuated the stillness.  Barty, owner of Grimshaw's Butchers, stood before his shop, a looming, dark silhouette against the pale grey sky.  He knew, with a certainty that chilled him more than the air, that today would be different.  Not just another day of meticulously carving joints of lamb and meticulously selecting the finest cuts of pork, but something…more.
