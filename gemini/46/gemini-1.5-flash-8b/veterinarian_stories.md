The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of the High Valleys, stinging Dr. Elara Blackwood's cheeks and rattling the flimsy metal sign that proclaimed "Blackwood's Equine Emporium" in faded, chipped paint.  Dust devils danced across the cracked earth, swirling around the lone, weathered building, its once-vibrant turquoise now a faded, sickly shade.
