The biting wind howled a mournful dirge against the viewport of the Zephyr, a symphony of icy whispers that mirrored the turmoil in Captain Elara Blackwood's heart.  Below, the jagged peaks of the Azure Mountains scraped the bruised twilight sky, their snow-capped summits shimmering like shattered shards of obsidian.  A swirling vortex of cloud obscured the valley where the lost cargo freighter, the "Star Wanderer," was last sighted.  Elara, her breath misting in the frigid air, gripped the controls of the Zephyr, her knuckles white against the polished metal. The Zephyr, a sleek, silver bird of war and trade, was her only connection to the outside world, a lifeline in this unforgiving, wind-lashed wilderness.

The year was 2347.  The remnants of the Great Collapse had fractured the once-unified world into a patchwork of autonomous territories, each clinging to its own desperate dreams of survival.  The Azure Territories, wedged between the hostile northern ice wastes and the volatile volcanic lands to the south, were a particularly treacherous place, their resources scarce and guarded fiercely by rival factions.  Elara, a veteran pilot with eyes that held the secrets of countless storms and the scars of countless near-misses, was tasked with locating the missing freighter and its priceless cargo.  Not only did she need the cargo, but her reputation and her family's meager livelihood depended on her success in this desolate, mountainous region.
