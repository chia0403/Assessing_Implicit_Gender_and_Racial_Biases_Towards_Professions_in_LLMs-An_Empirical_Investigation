Rain hammered against the grimy windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, a relentless drumming that mirrored the anxieties churning within her.  The flickering fluorescent lights cast long, distorted shadows across the cluttered desk, highlighting the half-eaten takeout containers and stacks of clinical files that seemed to grow taller with each passing day.  This small, windowless office, tucked away on the third floor of a dilapidated building in the heart of the city's impoverished Northside, felt like a pressure cooker.  Eleanor, a clinical psychologist with a decade of experience, was perpetually on edge, both professionally and personally.  The city, a sprawling canvas of concrete and despair, seemed to breathe down her neck, its unspoken worries pressed against the dampened glass.  Every creak of the building, every distant siren, seemed to amplify the relentless weight of her patients' stories.
