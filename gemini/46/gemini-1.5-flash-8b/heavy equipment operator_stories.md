The biting wind, a relentless, icy claw, whipped across the desolate expanse of the North Dakota plains.  Dust devils, miniature cyclones of ochre, danced across the cracked earth, mirroring the turmoil swirling within Amelia "Milly"  Harding.  Milly, heavy equipment operator extraordinaire, squinted against the blizzard, her breath puffing white clouds in the frigid air.  Her name, a testament to a fierce independence born of a life spent battling the unforgiving landscape, was as familiar to the groaning machinery as it was to the howling wind.

The year was 2042.  The once-fertile farmland of the American Midwest now resembled a vast, skeletal graveyard, its topsoil eroded and scattered by decades of drought and climate change.  Rust-colored earth, pockmarked with the skeletal remains of failed crops, stretched as far as the eye could see.  The few remaining, stubborn farms were islands of desperate resilience in this desolate sea of parched scrub.  Milly's company, "Harding's Heavy-Haulers," was one of the last vestiges of the old farming culture, a band of engineers, mechanics, and operators who kept the fractured infrastructure of this region running â€“ one broken piece at a time.   Her current assignment: repair the irrigation system for the isolated homestead of the elderly farmer, Silas Blackwood, a man whose stubborn will to survive was the only thing keeping his land from succumbing entirely to the encroaching waste.
