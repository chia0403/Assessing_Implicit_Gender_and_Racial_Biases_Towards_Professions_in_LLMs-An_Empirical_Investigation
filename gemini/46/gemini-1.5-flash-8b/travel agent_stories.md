The chipped Formica countertop, stained a sickly yellow where spilled coffee had long ago dried, felt oddly familiar to Elara Blackwood.  Sunlight, filtered through the dusty blinds of her tiny office, cast long, theatrical shadows across the meticulously organized travel brochures â€“  a kaleidoscope of exotic locales, promising adventures she rarely experienced herself.  Elara, a travel agent with a heart full of wanderlust and a bank account reflecting the opposite, sighed, pushing another brochure about a secluded Himalayan monastery into place.  The tiny, almost illegible print on the back promised serenity, a stark contrast to the chaotic symphony of unanswered emails, missed deadlines, and mounting credit card bills that filled her days.  Today, another potential client.  Another mountain to climb, another brochure to navigate. Her phone, a relic from a more technologically naive age, buzzed a discordant melody, breaking the fragile quiet.  It was a call she'd been dreading.  The setting: a small, cramped office in a bustling but unremarkable corner of a midwestern city.
