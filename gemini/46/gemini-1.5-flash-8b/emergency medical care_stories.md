Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, a relentless drumming that mirrored the frantic rhythm of Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's heart.  The small, perpetually-damp clinic, nestled between a sprawling avocado orchard and a crumbling, centuries-old stone wall, was her world.  A world of splintered bones, choked breaths, and the sterile, faintly metallic tang of antiseptic.  Tonight, however, the air hung thick with something else â€“ fear.  Not the calculated, clinical fear of a suspected heart attack, but the primal, gut-wrenching terror that accompanied a truly catastrophic event. The rhythmic, almost hypnotic, pounding of the rain was punctuated by the rhythmic, chillingly-regular beeping of the emergency monitor in Room 3.  Amy, her worn, beige scrubs damp with sweat, glanced at the digital clock on the wall. 11:57 PM.  The clock ticked inexorably, each second echoing the frantic thoughts racing through her mind.  She had already done the initial checks, the rapid assessment. The patient, a young woman named Isabella, was showing no signs of improvement, the monitor's jagged lines whispering of a struggle against an unseen, merciless foe.  And Amy knew, with a cold certainty that prickled her skin, that tonight, the fight wouldn't be easy.
