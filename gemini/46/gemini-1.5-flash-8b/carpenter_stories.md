The chipped paint of the workshop door, a faded, sickly green, scraped against Elias Thorne's worn leather apron as he pushed it open.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight slicing through the gloom, illuminating splinters of wood and shavings that littered the floor like fallen stars.  Elias, a carpenter with calloused hands and eyes that held the wisdom of weathered oak, sighed.  Another day, another silent workshop, another symphony of saws and hammers waiting to begin.  The scent of pine, freshly cut and tinged with the faint, almost imperceptible aroma of linseed oil, hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the encroaching chill of the coming autumn.  The workshop, a small, cramped space tucked away behind a row of cobblestone buildings in the heart of the old town, was his sanctuary and his prison.  His only companion the steady rhythm of the tools he wielded, the rasp of sandpaper and the satisfying click of a perfectly fitted joint.
