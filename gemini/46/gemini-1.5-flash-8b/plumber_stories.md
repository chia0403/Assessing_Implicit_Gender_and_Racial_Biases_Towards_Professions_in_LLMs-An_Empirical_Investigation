The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Leaky Faucet" plumbing shop hummed, a counterpoint to the rhythmic clang of wrenches and the occasional, frustrated sigh of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield.  Barty, a man whose perpetually damp overalls seemed to absorb the shop's ambient moisture, leaned over a sink overflowing with a particularly stubborn brown sludge.  He traced the jagged lines of the drainpipe with a calloused finger, his brow furrowed in concentration.  The tiny, porcelain figurine of a cherubic cherub, perched precariously on the edge of the sink, seemed to stare at him with judgment.

The shop, nestled in the heart of the grimy, back-alley district of Old Port, was a labyrinth of pipes, tools, and the faintly metallic smell of copper.  Dust motes danced in the weak sunlight filtering through the grime-coated windows.  Posters of cartoonish plumbers with exaggerated muscles and improbable solutions adorned the walls, mocking the reality of leaky pipes and clogged drains.  A tattered copy of "Plumber's Pocket Guide to the Unspeakable" lay open on a workbench, dog-eared and stained with various fluids, a testament to the shop's eclectic clientele.  The air, thick with the smell of mildew and solder, hung heavy, creating a humid microclimate that Barty had come to accept as his domain.
