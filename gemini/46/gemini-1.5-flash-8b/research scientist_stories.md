The fluorescent lights of the bio-research facility hummed, a constant, low thrumming that resonated in Dr. Eleanor Vance's ears.  She adjusted the focus on the microscope, her brow furrowed in concentration.  The specimen – a genetically modified tardigrade, its tiny body illuminated with a mesmerizing green fluorescence – pulsed with an erratic rhythm.  The lab, a sterile white cube bathed in the sterile light, smelled faintly of antiseptic and something subtly metallic, like old machinery.  Rows of identical, glass-fronted incubators lined the walls, each containing a unique experiment, a testament to the countless hours Eleanor had poured into her research.  Dust motes danced in the almost silent air, caught in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom of the adjacent corridor.  It was 3 AM, and the lab was hers alone.  Tonight, however, the pulse was different.  Something was off.
