The chipped paint of the antique dresser, a faded rose-gold that whispered of a bygone era, reflected the flickering candlelight illuminating Amelia Butterfield’s meticulous work.  Dust motes danced in the air, illuminated like tiny, ethereal constellations.  Amelia, a softly-spoken interior decorator with eyes the colour of warm caramel, carefully positioned a single, perfectly formed amethyst geode amongst the floral porcelain figurines.  Her meticulously-arranged workspace, tucked away in a converted attic above the bustling antiques market in the heart of the city, was a sanctuary of calm and controlled chaos.  Antique mirrors reflected rows of carefully curated textiles and paint swatches, scattered around her miniature, meticulously-ordered world.   Today was the pivotal day for the 'Serendipity' project – a bespoke living room for a client who described their tastes as "a symphony of unexpected contrasts." Amelia had poured weeks of her life into this design, a meticulous dance between her creativity and the constraints of their wishes. Outside, the city rumbled with the hypnotic rhythm of urban life – a constant, echoing background score to her focused efforts.
