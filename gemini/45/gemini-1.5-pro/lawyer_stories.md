Rain lashed against the stained-glass window depicting Saint Jude, patron saint of lost causes, a fitting irony given Amelia Hayes’ current predicament.  Her office, usually bathed in the warm glow of late afternoon sun, was now shrouded in a premature twilight, the only illumination coming from the flickering gaslight on her mahogany desk.  Outside, the cobbled streets of 1888 Edinburgh roiled with a tempestuous mix of wind, rain, and the hurried footsteps of those seeking shelter. Inside, Amelia, her full name Amelia Grace Hayes, barrister-at-law, stared at a single, unopened letter, its cream-colored envelope stark against the dark wood. The embossed crest – a raven perched atop a skull – sent a shiver down her spine. It was the sigil of the Blackwood family, a name synonymous with wealth, power, and a darkness that whispered through the city’s closes and wynds.  This was not the kind of client Amelia typically represented. Her usual cases involved petty theft, disputes over property lines, the occasional drunken brawl. This… this felt different.  Dangerously different.
