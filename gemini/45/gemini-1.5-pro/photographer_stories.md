The salt-laced wind whipped Amelia "Mia" Flores's dark hair across her face, stinging her eyes and coating her lips with the taste of the Pacific.  The crumbling cliffs of Big Sur, California, plunged dramatically into the churning turquoise water below, their ochre faces streaked with the deep green of tenacious cypress trees clinging to impossibly steep slopes.  Mia, perched precariously on a rocky outcrop, braced her tripod against a gust, her Canon EOS R5 clutched tight in her gloved hand.  The late afternoon sun, a molten orb dipping towards the horizon, cast long, dramatic shadows across the breathtaking vista, painting the sky in hues of fiery orange, bruised purple, and deep rose.  This was it. This was the shot she'd been chasing for weeks â€“ the perfect blend of light, shadow, and the raw, untamed beauty of the California coast.
