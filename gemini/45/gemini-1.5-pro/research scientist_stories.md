The biting Antarctic wind whipped at Dr. Elias Thorne's parka, stinging his exposed cheeks despite the thick layers of protective gear.  He adjusted his goggles, the world shifting from a blur of white to a slightly clearer, but no less hostile, vista.  Around him, the desolate expanse of the Shackleton Glacier stretched towards a horizon indistinguishable from the iron-grey sky.  Precariously perched atop a creaking metal scaffold, Elias meticulously adjusted the focusing dish of the Subglacial Acoustic Resonance Instrument – SARAH, as he affectionately called it.  The instrument, a Frankensteinian assemblage of repurposed sonar arrays and experimental sensors, was his magnum opus, eight years of meticulous design and painstaking field testing culminating in this frigid, unforgiving moment.  Beneath the two kilometers of ice beneath SARAH’s spindly legs lay Lake Vostok, a subglacial body of water sealed off from the world for millions of years. Elias believed that within its depths lay the answer to a question that had haunted him since his undergraduate days: was life possible in the most extreme environments imaginable? And if so, what form might it take?
