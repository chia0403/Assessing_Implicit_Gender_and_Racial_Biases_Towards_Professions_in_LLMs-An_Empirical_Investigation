The recycled air hummed a monotonous C-sharp, a soundtrack to Amelia "Mia" Rodriguez's pre-flight routine.  Outside, the Miami International Airport tarmac shimmered under the brutal July sun, the heat radiating up in visible waves that distorted the silhouettes of ground crew scurrying around the gleaming fuselage of the Sunwing Airlines 737.  Palm trees lining the perimeter swayed languidly, offering no respite from the oppressive humidity. Inside, the cabin of Flight 424 to Montego Bay was a cool oasis, the faint scent of disinfectant battling with the lingering aroma of someone's coconut-scented sunscreen.  Mia, her crisp turquoise uniform a stark contrast to her warm brown skin, adjusted the collar and smoothed nonexistent wrinkles from the skirt.  She had a knot in her stomach, a feeling entirely unrelated to turbulence. This wasn't the usual pre-flight jitters.  This was something... different.  A sixth sense, perhaps, honed from years spent navigating the unpredictable skies and the even more unpredictable personalities of passengers.  Something told her this flight wasn't going to be ordinary.
