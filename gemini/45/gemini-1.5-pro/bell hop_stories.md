The brass doorknobs gleamed under the opulent chandeliers of the Grand Majestic Hotel, reflecting the bustling lobby like a thousand tiny, distorted mirrors.  A cacophony of sounds – the clinking of champagne flutes, the murmur of polite conversation, the rhythmic click-clack of heels on marble – filled the air.  But amidst this symphony of upper-class leisure, Bartholomew "Barty" Finch, barely five foot four and clad in a slightly-too-large maroon uniform, remained acutely aware of the quiet creak of his own worn leather shoes. He was a shadow flitting between the grandeur, a silent observer of the lives he would likely never lead. Tonight, the Grand Majestic was hosting the annual Diamond Gala, and the air crackled with an electric anticipation Barty could almost taste. It promised to be a night of extravagant gowns, glittering jewels, and secrets whispered behind bejeweled hands.  Barty, however, was more concerned with the growing mountain of luggage piling up beside the grand staircase, a testament to the sheer volume of wealth and vanity that had descended upon the hotel.  He adjusted his cap and sighed, the weight of a hundred suitcases mirroring the weight of his own humble existence.  This was his stage, his world, a world of tips and tattered dreams played out beneath the watchful eyes of gilded cherubs perched atop marble pillars.
