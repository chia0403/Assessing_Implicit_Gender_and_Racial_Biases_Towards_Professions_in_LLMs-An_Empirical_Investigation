The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the Busy Bee Diner, a rhythm that Elias Thorne had come to find both comforting and maddening in his three years working there.  Neon signs flickered through the greasy windows, casting a lurid, otherworldly glow on the red vinyl booths and checkerboard floor.  It was a Tuesday night in October, the kind of night that sucked the warmth out of the bones and brought in only the desperate – truckers fighting deadlines, couples on the verge of a breakup fueled by lukewarm coffee, and Elias, perpetually stuck in the purgatory of his minimum-wage existence in Harmony Creek, Nevada, population 3,412 (and dwindling).  He tugged at the starched collar of his too-tight uniform shirt and sighed, wiping a stray raindrop off his nametag with the corner of a stained dishcloth.  The bell above the door chimed, announcing a new arrival, and Elias plastered on his best customer-service smile, one he’d perfected to mask the creeping despair that threatened to swallow him whole.
