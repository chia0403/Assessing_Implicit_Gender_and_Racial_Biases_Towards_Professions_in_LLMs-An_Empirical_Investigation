Rain lashed against the attic window of Elias Thorne's London flat, mimicking the drumming anxiety in his chest. Loose papers rustled on his desk, stirred by the draft whistling through the ill-fitting pane. Elias, hunched over a manuscript bathed in the warm glow of a desk lamp, chewed on the end of a red pen, his brow furrowed in concentration. Outside, the November wind howled like a banshee, a fitting soundtrack to the gothic horror novella clutched in his ink-stained fingers.  The flat, perched atop a crumbling Victorian building in the less fashionable end of Notting Hill, usually offered a charming view of chimney pots and tangled gardens. Tonight, it felt more like a prison, each gust of wind a whispered threat. The manuscript, titled "The Whispers of Blackthorn Manor," was proving to be more unsettling than Elias had anticipated.
