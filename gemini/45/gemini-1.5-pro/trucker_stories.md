The rusty diner sign, shaped like a coffee pot perpetually pouring, flickered against the bruised purple of the pre-dawn sky.  Rain lashed against the windows of the Big Rig Beanery, blurring the Nevada desert beyond into a watercolour wash of grey and ochre.

Darla Jean "DJ" McCready, her calloused hands wrapped around a steaming mug, watched the storm through the grime-streaked glass.  Her Peterbilt 379, "The Queen of the Road," was parked outside, a chrome and steel behemoth dwarfed by the vastness of the empty highway stretching out before her. DJ had a long haul ahead, a delivery of electronics bound for Chicago, and the gathering storm was just another hurdle in a life paved with them.  This stretch of I-80, notorious for its desolate beauty and sudden, violent weather, was just the beginning.
