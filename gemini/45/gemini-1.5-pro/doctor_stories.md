The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, stinging Dr. Elias Thorne's cheeks as he hurried along the cobbled streets of Wick, a small fishing town perched precariously on the northeastern tip of Scotland.  The sky, a bruised purple streaked with angry orange, promised a storm.  Salt spray hung in the air, mingling with the pungent aroma of fish and coal smoke.  Gas lamps flickered feebly against the encroaching darkness, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to mimic the swaying of the fishing boats in the harbour below.  It was late December, 1923, and a palpable sense of unease hung over the town, heavier than the impending snow.  Elias pulled his thick wool coat tighter around him, the collar scratching against his beard. He was already late, and the flickering lamplight in the window of the old stone cottage ahead, his destination, was a small beacon in the gathering gloom.  He just hoped he wasn't too late.
