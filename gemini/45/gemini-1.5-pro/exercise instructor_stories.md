The air in "Body By Beatrice" hung thick with the scent of sweat, cheap disinfectant, and the faintest whisper of desperation.  Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the scuffed hardwood floor.  Rain lashed against the large, street-facing windows, blurring the neon lights of downtown Burlington, Vermont into shimmering streaks. Beatrice "Bea" Fitzgerald, clad in neon pink leggings and a black tank top that read "Feel the Burn," clapped her hands sharply, her voice cutting through the thumping bass of the 80s workout playlist. "Alright, my beautiful Burners!  Five more squats, let's feel that fire in those glutes!" Her own glutes, sculpted through years of dedication and a diet suspiciously high in protein powder, barely quivered as she demonstrated the perfect form.  Only five people, scattered sparsely across the otherwise empty studio, mirrored her movements with varying degrees of enthusiasm.  The Tuesday night "Booty Blast" class was usually packed, but tonight, the only things booming louder than the music seemed to be the thunderclaps outside.
