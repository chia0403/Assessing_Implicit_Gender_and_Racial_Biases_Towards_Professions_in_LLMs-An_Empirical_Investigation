The biting November wind whipped around Vivian Holloway-Wittgenstein, plastering strands of her fiery red hair across her face as she surveyed the scene. Grey, turbulent waves crashed against the jagged cliffs of the Cornish coastline, sending plumes of salty spray high into the air.  A skeletal shipwreck, half-buried in the sand, lay like a beached leviathan, its ribs reaching towards the perpetually overcast sky.  This desolate stretch of beach, near the isolated village of Poltreath, was far from the sun-drenched glamour of Vivian's usual Hollywood sets, but it held the perfect melancholic beauty she envisioned for her next project, a gothic thriller titled "The Siren's Lament." This was more than just a location; it was a character in itself, a silent testament to the tragic story she was about to bring to life.
