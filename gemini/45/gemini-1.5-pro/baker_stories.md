The aroma of cardamom and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Elara Thistlewick.  Dawn painted the cobbled streets of Oakhaven a soft lavender, the only light besides the warm glow spilling from Thistlewick's Treats, Elara's bakery. Nestled between a dusty antique shop and a perpetually bustling flower market, the tiny storefront was a beacon of warmth in the otherwise sleepy village.  Inside, amidst the copper pots hanging from the ceiling and shelves stacked high with mismatched china, Elara, dusted with flour from her fingertips to her elbows, hummed a lilting tune as she kneaded a particularly stubborn batch of rye dough. The chill of early spring still clung to the air outside, but within the bakery, the heat from the oven radiated a comforting warmth that promised the coming summer.  Oakhaven, with its whispering willows and gossiping townsfolk, held Elara in its gentle embrace, a place where secrets were shared over steaming mugs of tea and life moved at the pace of a rising loaf.
