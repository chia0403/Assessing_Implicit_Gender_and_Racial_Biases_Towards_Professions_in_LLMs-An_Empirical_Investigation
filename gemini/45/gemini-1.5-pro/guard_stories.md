The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of Aerilon, stinging Elias Thorne's exposed cheeks.  He pulled his thick, wolf-fur lined hood tighter around his face, the frost already clinging to his eyelashes. The sky, a bruised purple canvas streaked with angry orange, hinted at the approaching blizzard.  Elias stood atop the crumbling watchtower, the only structure for miles, a solitary sentinel against the encroaching darkness. The tower, built from blackened stones that seemed to absorb the very light around them, was the easternmost guard post of the Citadel of Whispers, a fortress rumored to hold secrets older than the plains themselves. Tonight, Elias was alone, his usual companion called away to attend some obscure ritual within the Citadel walls.  The isolation pressed in on him, a palpable weight in the frigid air, amplifying the unsettling quiet that always preceded a storm on Aerilon. He clutched the hilt of his frost-forged sword, a cold comfort against the creeping unease. Something felt wrong.  The wind carried not just the promise of snow, but a whisper of something else...something sinister.
