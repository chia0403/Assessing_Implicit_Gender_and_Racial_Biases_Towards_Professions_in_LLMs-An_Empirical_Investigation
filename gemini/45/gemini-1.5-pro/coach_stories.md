The biting November wind whipped around Coach Eleanor "Ellie" Vance as she surveyed the muddy, churned-up field.  Floodlights cast long, skeletal shadows from the scraggly oaks lining the perimeter of Finchley Preparatory Academy's notoriously uneven soccer pitch.  Rain, thankfully, had ceased about an hour ago, but the air hung thick with the petrichor scent of damp earth and bruised grass.  Ellie, her breath clouding in the frigid air, tucked a stray strand of her auburn braid behind her ear and adjusted the brim of her Finchley Eagles baseball cap.  It was 7:00 pm, a full two hours past the scheduled end of practice, and only one player remained: fifteen-year-old Leo Maxwell, stubbornly practicing penalty kicks long after his teammates had retreated to the warmth of the locker rooms.
