The sun, a malevolent eye in the bruised purple sky, beat down on Amelia “Amy” Rodriguez’s back.  Heat shimmered off the cracked asphalt of Interstate 17, blurring the saguaro cacti that dotted the Arizona landscape into wavering green ghosts. Amy, her orange vest clinging damply to her skin, wiped the sweat from her brow with the back of her calloused hand.  The air hung thick and heavy with the smell of creosote and diesel.  Miles stretched before her, a ribbon of shimmering black unspooling into the desert, punctuated only by the rhythmic thump of the jackhammer tearing up a section of the road a hundred yards ahead.  It was a Tuesday in July, the kind of day where even the rattlesnakes were seeking shade, and Amy, along with the rest of her crew, was tasked with patching a particularly nasty pothole that threatened to swallow a compact car whole. The wind, hot and dry as a furnace blast, whipped across the desolate landscape, carrying with it the fine dust of the desert and the low rumble of an approaching eighteen-wheeler.  It was going to be a long day.
