The aroma of stale coffee and damp wool clung to the air in Mrs. Eleanor Vance's classroom, a testament to the relentless October rain that had plagued the small town of Havenwood for the past week.  Havenwood Elementary, a squat brick building with a perpetually leaky roof and a playground populated by rusting swing sets, sat perched atop the only hill in town, overlooking a patchwork of farmland slowly surrendering to the encroaching autumn. Inside Room 2B,  sunlight, weak and watery, struggled to penetrate the grime-streaked windows, casting long shadows across the alphabet frieze and the construction paper turkeys clinging precariously to the bulletin board. Mrs. Vance, a woman whose kind face and perpetually frazzled bun belied a fierce dedication to her third-graders, sighed as she surveyed the scene.  Recess had been held indoors due to the weather, resulting in a cacophony of pent-up energy that manifested in a near-constant hum of whispers, giggles, and the rhythmic thump of a rogue soccer ball against the underside of a desk.  This was going to be a long day.
