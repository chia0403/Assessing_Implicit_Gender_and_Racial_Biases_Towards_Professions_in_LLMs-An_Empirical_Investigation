The rasping shriek of Elias Thorne's hand saw sliced through the pre-dawn quiet of Port Blossom, Maine.  A sliver of apricot sunlight, just peeking over the ragged peaks of the Mount Desert range, illuminated the swirling sawdust motes dancing around him. Elias, his breath puffing white clouds in the frigid October air, braced the rough-hewn oak beam against his workhorse of a workbench – a relic passed down from his grandfather, scarred with the ghosts of a thousand projects. His workshop, a converted lobster shack perched precariously on stilts above the churning Atlantic, creaked and groaned in sympathy with every push and pull of the saw. The salty tang of the ocean mingled with the sweet, earthy scent of fresh-cut wood, a familiar perfume that Elias had inhaled since he was a boy, barely tall enough to see over the workbench. Today, however, the familiar comfort of the scent was tinged with a nervous anticipation. This wasn't just another repair job on a lobster boat or a new set of shutters for a seaside cottage. This was the commission, the one that could finally put Port Blossom – and Elias Thorne – on the map.
