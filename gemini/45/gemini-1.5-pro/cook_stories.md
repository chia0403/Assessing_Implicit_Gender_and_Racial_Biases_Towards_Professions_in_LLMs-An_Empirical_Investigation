The clatter of pots and the sizzle of butter in a cast iron skillet were the soundtrack of Elias Thorne's life.  Elias, all elbows and flour-dusted apron, navigated the cramped kitchen of The Salty Spoon like a seasoned sailor in a storm.  The Salty Spoon wasn't much to look at â€“ a tiny, weather-beaten diner clinging to the edge of the Oregon coast in the sleepy town of Port Blossom.  Salt spray perpetually kissed the windows, and the scent of the Pacific mingled with the aroma of frying fish and brewing coffee, creating a unique perfume that clung to everything.  This evening, however, the usual calm was replaced by a nervous energy. A thick fog had rolled in, swallowing the town and the usually bustling highway, leaving The Salty Spoon eerily deserted.  Elias wiped his brow with the back of his hand, a knot of unease tightening in his stomach. This stillness felt different, ominous.  He glanced at the clock above the griddle: 7:53 pm. Almost closing time, but something told him he wouldn't be going home anytime soon.
