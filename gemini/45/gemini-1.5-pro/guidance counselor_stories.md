Rain lashed against the arched windows of Ms. Eleanor Vance's office, blurring the already fading October light into a hazy grey. The rhythmic drumming against the glass mirrored the anxious thrumming in Eleanor's chest.

Yearbooks stacked neatly on her bookshelf, each a testament to graduating classes past, seemed to offer silent judgment on her ability to navigate the delicate and often fraught emotional landscape of the students currently in her care.  A single, flickering fluorescent light buzzed overhead, casting long, skeletal shadows across the worn floral rug and illuminating the faint water stains that stubbornly refused to disappear from the acoustic tiles on the ceiling. The lingering scent of stale coffee and wet wool hung in the air, a melancholic perfume of adolescence and uncertainty.
