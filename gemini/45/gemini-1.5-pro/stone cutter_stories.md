The wind, sharp and smelling of pine needles and thawing earth, whipped through the valley of Aethelgard, tugging at Elias Thornewood's thick woolen tunic.  Grey clouds, heavy with the promise of spring rain, clung to the peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains, their jagged silhouettes looming over the small quarry where Elias worked. Chips of granite, sharp as knives, danced around his feet as his hammer, wielded with the practiced ease of decades, struck the pale stone.  Each blow echoed through the valley, a rhythmic counterpoint to the rush of the nearby river, the Aethel, from which the valley took its name. Elias, his face weathered and lined like the granite he shaped, paused, squinting at the half-formed statue emerging from the rock. It was a commission for Lord Elmsworth, a pompous but wealthy landowner, depicting his prize-winning stallion, aptly named "Thunder." Elias grunted. He preferred working on gargoyles and other fantastical creatures, letting his imagination flow into the stone, but bread and butter were earned through the vanities of men, not the whimsy of myth.
