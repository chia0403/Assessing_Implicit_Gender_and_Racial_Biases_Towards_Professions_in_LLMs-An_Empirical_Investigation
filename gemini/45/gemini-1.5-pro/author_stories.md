The salt-laced wind whipped Amelia Thorne’s auburn braid across her face, stinging her cheeks already raw from the November chill.  Perched precariously on the jagged cliffs of Yaquina Head, Oregon, she braced herself against a gust that threatened to tear the worn leather-bound notebook from her grasp. Below, the Pacific roared, a restless beast gnawing at the rocky shoreline.  Amelia, a celebrated author known for her intricate historical fiction, found the dramatic landscape oddly inspiring, yet simultaneously unnerving.  She’d come to this remote lighthouse keeper’s cottage seeking solitude, a sanctuary where she could wrestle with the crippling writer’s block that had plagued her for months following the unexpected success of her latest novel.  The cottage itself, a compact two-story structure clinging to the cliff face, offered little comfort.  Its whitewashed walls were weathered and peeling, the windows rattling in their frames like chattering teeth. Inside, a single kerosene lamp cast flickering shadows that danced across the dusty, sparsely furnished rooms, hinting at a long-forgotten history.  Amelia, however, had little interest in the past at this moment.  Her present was bleak enough.
