The clatter of aluminum against steel, the hiss of the flat-top, the pungent aroma of caramelizing onions â€“ this was Beatrice "Bea" Flores's symphony.  The cramped kitchen of "Le Papillon Bleu," tucked away on a cobbled side street in the Marais district of Paris, was her kingdom. It was 5:45 am, the sky outside still a bruised purple, but Bea, with her fiery red hair pulled back in a tight bun and a smudge of flour on her cheek, was already a whirlwind of controlled motion.  Rain slicked the cobblestones outside, reflecting the neon glow of the boulangerie across the street, a scene Bea barely registered as she meticulously arranged sprigs of microgreens on a plate of perfectly seared scallops. Le Papillon Bleu, with its faded blue awning and mismatched chairs, was far from the Michelin-starred establishments Bea had trained in, but it was hers.  And tonight, the food critic from Le Figaro was coming.
