The stale air in Evangeline "Eva" Rostova's office tasted of instant coffee and the faint, lingering scent of bleach used to scrub away the graffiti someone had sprayed on the brick wall outside the probation office last week. Rain lashed against the single, grimy window, mirroring the relentless drizzle that had plagued the city of Port Blossom, Oregon for the past month.  Files, thick as bricks and twice as heavy, teetered precariously on her desk, threatening to avalanche onto the threadbare carpet below. Eva, her dark hair pulled back in a tight bun, tapped a chipped crimson nail against a mug stained with the ghost of a thousand more coffees. Outside, the neon sign of the "Mermaid's Kiss" tavern flickered intermittently, a beacon in the damp, grey twilight.  It was 5:57 pm on a Tuesday, and Eva Rostova had exactly three minutes left until she could escape the oppressive humidity of her office and the even more oppressive weight of her caseload.  She just hoped tonight wouldn't bring another surprise visit from one of her moreâ€¦ volatile clients.
