The opulent lobby of the Grand Elysium Hotel shimmered under the weight of a thousand crystal chandeliers.  Rain lashed against the arched windows, blurring the view of the Parisian skyline beyond.  Inside, a fire crackled merrily in the marble fireplace, casting flickering shadows on the plush velvet furnishings.  This was Genevieve Dubois’ domain.  With her impeccably coiffed chestnut bun and a smile as polished as the brass nameplate on her mahogany desk, Genevieve, the hotel’s chief concierge, surveyed her kingdom with a practiced eye.  Nothing escaped her notice, from the slightly askew tassel on a curtain to the faintest tremor of anxiety on a guest's face. Tonight, however, a different kind of tremor was in the air, a subtle shift in the usual rhythm of the Grand Elysium, a premonition of something… unusual.
