The flickering neon sign of "Shear Genius" buzzed erratically, casting a lavender glow across the rain-slicked pavement. Inside, Amelia “Amy” Rodriguez swept up a fine dusting of clipped hair, the scent of coconut shampoo and cheap aftershave hanging heavy in the air.  It was almost 10 pm on a Tuesday in the sleepy town of Oakhaven, Oregon, population barely scraping 3,000. Amy usually closed up shop at 6, but Mrs. Higgins had insisted on a last-minute perm, a ritual she performed religiously before every bingo night at the VFW.  The bell above the door chimed, its cheerful jingle incongruous with the gnawing unease that suddenly settled in Amy’s stomach.  She hadn't expected any more customers, not tonight, not in this weather.
