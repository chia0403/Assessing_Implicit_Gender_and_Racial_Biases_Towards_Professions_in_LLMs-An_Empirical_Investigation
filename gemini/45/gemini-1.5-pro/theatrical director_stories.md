The biting November wind whipped around Esmeralda "Esme" Rodriguez as she navigated the labyrinthine back alleys of the Rialto Theatre, her breath clouding the air.  The Rialto, a grand dame of a building clinging to its faded glory on the edge of Chicago's Theatre District, was a far cry from the Broadway stages Esme dreamed of conquering.  Tonight, however, it was her kingdom.  The scent of dust, stale coffee, and something vaguely floral – probably the ancient velvet curtains – hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume that always preceded opening night.  Tonight, it was the premiere of her daringly reimagined production of  "A Midsummer Night's Dream," set not in a whimsical Athenian forest, but in a gritty, neon-drenched cyberpunk dystopia. Esme, clad in her trademark black turtleneck and combat boots, clutched the worn copy of the script, her fingers tracing the lines of Shakespeare's words as if they were a lifeline.  The weight of the production, the months of rehearsals, the whispers of doubt from the more traditional members of the board, all pressed down on her, a tangible force in the chilly air.  But beneath the pressure, a spark of electric anticipation flickered. Tonight, she would either fly or fall.
