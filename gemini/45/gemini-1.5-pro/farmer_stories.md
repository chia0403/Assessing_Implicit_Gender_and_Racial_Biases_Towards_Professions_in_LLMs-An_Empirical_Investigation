The biting wind, straight off the glacier-capped Mount Cinder, whipped at Elias Thorne's thick woolen coat as he surveyed his fields.  The valley, nestled between the Cinder range and the whispering pines of the Whispering Woods, was usually bathed in the golden light of the twin suns, Solaris and Lunara.  But today, a bruised purple cloud hung heavy in the sky, promising the first snow of the season.  Elias, his calloused hands tucked deep in his pockets, frowned.  The kale, his prized crop, was barely a week from harvest, and a heavy snowfall now could ruin everything.  His farm, Thorneâ€™s Hollow, nestled at the foot of the valley, represented generations of back-breaking work, and Elias, like his father and his father before him, was bound to the land by ties stronger than any rope. This harvest was crucial, not just for his family's survival through the long winter, but for the fragile peace he'd brokered with the nomadic tribes who grazed their frost-grazers on the high plains beyond the Cinder range.  The kale was the cornerstone of that peace, a yearly tribute that held back the tide of conflict.
