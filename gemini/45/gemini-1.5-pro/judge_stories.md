The mahogany desk, polished to a gleam that rivaled the scales of Justice herself, reflected the flickering gaslight back into the face of Judge Elias Thorne.  Rain lashed against the tall windows of his chambers, a mournful counterpoint to the crackling fire in the hearth. Outside, the cobbled streets of New Birmingham, perpetually shrouded in a haze of coal smoke, were slick with a greasy sheen.  It was late, nearing midnight, and the courthouse, a gothic behemoth that loomed over the cityâ€™s industrial heart, was deserted save for Elias and the rustling whispers of the wind that seemed to find their way into every shadowed corner.  Tonight, however, the unsettling emptiness was not what troubled the Judge.  A single, unopened envelope lay on his otherwise pristine blotter, its stark whiteness a jarring intrusion. The elegant script of the address, his full name and title meticulously penned, was instantly recognizable. It belonged to Lord Ashworth, a man whose influence stretched across the city like the dark tendrils of a subterranean vine, and whose summons Elias had always dreaded.
