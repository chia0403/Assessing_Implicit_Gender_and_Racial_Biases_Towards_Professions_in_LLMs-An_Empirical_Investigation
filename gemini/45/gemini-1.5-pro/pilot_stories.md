The biting Alaskan wind whipped at Amelia "Ace" Reyes's flight jacket, tugging at the fur-lined hood as she prepped her De Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver for takeoff.  The sun, a pale ghost hovering just above the sawtooth peaks of the Wrangell Mountains, cast long, ethereal shadows across the frozen expanse of McCarthy Creek.  Ice crystals glittered in the air, a shimmering curtain between Ace and the dilapidated mining town clinging precariously to the mountainside.  It was 5:00 am, and the temperature hovered somewhere around twenty below zero.  A typical Tuesday morning in McCarthy, Alaska, population: 28, give or take a moose or two.  Today's cargo: a crate of medical supplies for the small clinic in Kennecott, a ghost town nestled even further into the wilderness, and a nervous geologist with a penchant for tweed and a terror of small planes.  Ace, however, felt a familiar thrill course through her as she ran her pre-flight checks.  This desolate, unforgiving landscape was her office, and the sky, her domain.
