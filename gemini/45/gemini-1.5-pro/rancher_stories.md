The wind, a relentless sculptor, had carved deep lines into Elias Thorne's face, mirroring the furrows it plowed through the dry, ochre earth of his ranch.  The Rocking T Ranch, nestled in the heart of the Montana badlands, stretched as far as the eye could see, a patchwork of dusty plains and craggy buttes rising like ancient, broken teeth against the vast, cobalt sky.  It was a harsh land, unforgiving, yet Elias, with his calloused hands and sun-squinted eyes, held a deep, abiding love for this place, this unforgiving kingdom he’d inherited from his father, and his father before him. The year was 1933, the dust bowl was choking the life out of the plains, and the whispers of hardship had turned into a chilling roar. This morning, however, the air held a different kind of tension.  A stillness, heavy and ominous, clung to the ranch like a shroud, broken only by the restless whinny of Elias’s prize stallion, a magnificent black Morgan named Midnight.
