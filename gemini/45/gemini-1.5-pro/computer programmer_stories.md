The fluorescent hum of the server room fought a losing battle against the insistent thrum of rain against the corrugated iron roof.  Amelia Grace Holloway, fingers flying across the mechanical keyboard, barely registered either. Her hazel eyes, usually bright and inquisitive, were now dull with exhaustion, fixed on the cascading lines of code scrolling across her monitor.  The air hung thick with the metallic scent of overheated electronics and the faint ghost of stale coffee. Amelia's tiny office, tucked away in a forgotten corner of the vast warehouse that housed "Innovate or Die," a struggling tech startup in the perpetually damp outskirts of Seattle, was a testament to her dedication â€“ and her employer's frugality.  Empty takeout containers littered the small desk, vying for space amongst tangled cables and dog-eared programming manuals.  Outside, the pre-dawn darkness clung to the city, a blanket against the encroaching November chill.  Inside, Amelia waged her own silent war against a particularly vicious bug that threatened to derail the launch of their new app, her only companions the rhythmic click-clack of the keys and the low, insistent hum of the servers, a soundtrack to her sleepless nights.
