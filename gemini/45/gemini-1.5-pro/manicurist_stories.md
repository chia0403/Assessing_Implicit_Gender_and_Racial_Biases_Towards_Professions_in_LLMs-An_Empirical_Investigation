The bell above the door of "Nailed It," a tiny salon squeezed between a laundromat and a perpetually-closed bakery, jingled merrily.  Rain lashed against the window, blurring the neon "OPEN" sign and turning the already-grey streets of Astoria, Queens into a shimmering, impressionistic painting. Elara Sofia Hernandez, her name stitched in elegant cursive on her crisp white uniform, sighed and looked up from the intricate floral design she was painting on Mrs. Dimitriou’s thumb. Outside, the downpour showed no sign of letting up, which meant her walk home tonight would be a soggy one. But at least the rain brought a certain quiet intimacy to the salon, a hush punctuated only by the whir of the nail drill and the soft murmur of Mrs. Dimitriou recounting her daughter’s latest triumph in the spelling bee. Elara smiled politely, her mind already racing with ideas for the upcoming nail art competition, her one shot at escaping the gentle monotony of perfectly polished fingertips and predictable neighbourhood gossip.  This year, she was determined to win.
