The humid Charleston air hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine and impending rain. Inside "Snips & Sass," a brightly painted salon nestled between a used bookstore and a purveyor of artisanal pickles, Amelia Grace Hawthorne meticulously arranged her silver-handled shears on a pristine white towel.  Sunlight, fractured by the stained-glass panels flanking the entrance, dappled the worn wooden floorboards.  Amelia, with her riot of auburn curls pinned back with a tortoiseshell comb, surveyed her domain with a practiced eye.  Tuesday mornings were usually slow, a lull before the rush of ladies prepping for bridge club and dinner dates, leaving Amelia ample time to sharpen her shears and mentally choreograph the intricate updos she envisioned creating.  The tinkling chime above the door, however, signaled an unexpected arrival, breaking the quiet spell of the morning.
