The relentless Oregon rain hammered against the oversized windows of Aspen Dental, blurring the already muted November light. Inside, the air hummed with the low whine of the suction and the rhythmic scrape of a scaler.  Eleanor Vance, a dental hygienist with ten years and countless plaque-ridden molars under her belt, sighed, adjusting the tiny mirror in her gloved hand.

Her current patient, Mr. Henderson, a retired fisherman with a penchant for chewing tobacco and an aversion to flossing, grunted in the chair. Eleanor, her turquoise scrubs a stark contrast to the grey outside, braced herself for another round of tartar combat.  This was her fourth deep cleaning of the day, and the lingering metallic tang of blood and antiseptic was starting to wear on her, even after years of exposure.  Little did she know, the monotony of plaque and gingivitis was about to be shattered.
