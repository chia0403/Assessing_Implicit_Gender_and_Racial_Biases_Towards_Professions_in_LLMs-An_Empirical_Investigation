The flickering fluorescent lights of the D&M Architectural firm buzzed like trapped insects, a soundtrack to Amelia Reyes’ Tuesday morning.  Amelia, her full name Amelia Sofia Reyes, hunched over her drafting table, the cool steel pressing against her forearms.  Outside, the Chicago wind howled, rattling the large plate glass windows that showcased a grey, November sky pregnant with sleet. Inside, the air was stale with the scent of old blueprints, burnt coffee, and the faint metallic tang Amelia associated with the constant, low-grade stress of looming deadlines.  She squinted at the intricate network of lines on the vellum before her – the skeletal framework of what would one day be a thirty-story glass and steel behemoth destined to pierce the already cluttered skyline.  The building, currently known only as Project Chimera, was the biggest project D&M had landed in years, and Amelia, despite being relatively junior, had been entrusted with a significant portion of the technical drawings.  This morning, however, her focus was stubbornly elusive. A knot of anxiety tightened in her chest, a feeling that had been her constant companion ever since the cryptic, anonymous note had appeared on her desk yesterday.
