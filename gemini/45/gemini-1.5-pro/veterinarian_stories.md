The biting wind whipped around Dr. Elspeth "Ellie" Vance, stinging her cheeks and turning the loose strands of her auburn hair into icy whips.  She pulled her thick wool coat tighter around her as she trudged across the frozen yard, the crunch of snow under her heavy boots the only sound besides the mournful lowing of a cow in the distance.

Tonight, however, the romanticism was lost on Ellie.  The emergency call had come in just as she was settling in with a mug of hot chocolate and a well-worn copy of James Herriot, and the prospect of a difficult calving in sub-zero temperatures had extinguished any festive cheer she might have been clinging to.
