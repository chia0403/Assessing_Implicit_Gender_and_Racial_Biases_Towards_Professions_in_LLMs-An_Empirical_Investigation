The insistent London drizzle, a fine mist that seemed to seep into everything, plastered Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's auburn curls to her forehead.  It was a Tuesday in late November, the kind of day where the sky was the colour of wet concrete and the air smelled of damp wool and exhaust fumes. Amy hurried along Brick Lane, clutching her portfolio case close, its sharp corners digging into her side.  She was late, unforgivably late, for her interview at "Inkslingers," the hottest graphic design studio in Shoreditch.  Their minimalist, edgy aesthetic was everything Amy aspired to, and this interview, for a junior designer position, represented the culmination of years spent hunched over her Wacom tablet, fuelled by lukewarm coffee and sheer stubbornness. The studio occupied the top two floors of a converted warehouse, a stark contrast to the curry houses and vintage clothing stores that lined the street below.  Its massive steel and glass facade, illuminated from within by a cool, white light, loomed over Amy like a monolith, a daunting testament to her ambition.
