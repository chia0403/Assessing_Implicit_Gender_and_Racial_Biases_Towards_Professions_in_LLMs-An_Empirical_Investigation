The chipped paint on the "Worldly Adventures Travel Agency" sign mirrored the state of Amelia Pearl Holloway's spirit.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sunbeams that slanted through the grimy window, illuminating brochures promising azure seas and snow-capped peaks – destinations Amelia herself hadn't seen in years. Her office, tucked away in a forgotten corner of a small strip mall in Cedar Creek, Oregon, was a testament to dreams deferred. Outside, the only adventure on offer was the rumble of logging trucks hauling Douglas Fir down Highway 101, their scent a constant reminder of the verdant cage that held Amelia captive. The rhythmic tap-tap-tap of her manicured nails on the worn desk echoed in the otherwise silent space, a counterpoint to the gnawing emptiness in her gut.  This wasn't how she’d envisioned her life.  She'd studied Tourism Management, dreamt of exotic locales and exhilarating experiences. Instead, she was booking honeymoons to Disneyland and cruises to Alaska – perfectly pleasant, but a far cry from the African safaris and Himalayan treks that once danced in her head.  Today, however, something felt different.  A strange energy crackled in the air, a premonition of change – or perhaps just the faulty wiring she’d been meaning to get fixed.
