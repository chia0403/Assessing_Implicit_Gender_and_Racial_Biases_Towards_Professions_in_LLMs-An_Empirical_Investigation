The biting November wind whipped at Amelia "Amy" Reyes's thick ponytail as she wrestled with a frozen padlock securing the gate to the abandoned Grimshaw Cannery. Flakes of rust, dislodged by her efforts, peppered the air like rusty confetti.  The cannery, a hulking brick behemoth on the edge of Port Blossom, Maine, had been shuttered for over a decade, its windows like vacant eyes staring out at the choppy grey waters of the Atlantic. Amy, bundled in her insulated Carhartt coveralls and steel-toed boots, finally freed the lock with a grunt of satisfaction.  The gate creaked open, revealing a courtyard choked with weeds and littered with the ghosts of a bygone industry - rusted machinery, discarded fishing nets, and a pervasive smell of salt and decay.  She was here to rewire the building for its new life as a trendy seafood restaurant, a project that promised to be both challenging and lucrative, but the uneasy atmosphere of the place made her shiver despite her warm clothing.  The wind seemed to whisper secrets through the broken panes of glass, and she couldn't shake the feeling that she wasn't alone in the vast, echoing space.
