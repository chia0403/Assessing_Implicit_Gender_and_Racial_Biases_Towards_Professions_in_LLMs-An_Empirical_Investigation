The salt-laced wind whipped Amelia Iris Moreau's hair across her face, tasting of brine and distant storms.  Her easel, precariously perched on the cliff edge, vibrated with the gusts, mimicking the frantic flutter in her own chest. Below, the churning turquoise waters of the Aegean Sea crashed against the volcanic rock of Santorini, sending plumes of white foam skyward.  The village of Oia, a cascade of whitewashed houses clinging to the caldera's rim, blazed under the relentless midday sun. Amelia, shielded by a wide-brimmed straw hat, squinted, trying to capture the impossible vibrancy of the scene before her â€“ the cobalt dome of a nearby church, the fiery bougainvillea spilling over terracotta rooftops, the deep, almost indigo shadow cast by a solitary cypress tree.  This was her third day attempting to translate this breathtaking landscape onto canvas, and for the third day, she felt the frustrating inadequacy of her skill.  The real thing simply refused to be contained.
