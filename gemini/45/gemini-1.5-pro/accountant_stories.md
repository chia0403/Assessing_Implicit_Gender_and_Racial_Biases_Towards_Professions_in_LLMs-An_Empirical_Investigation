Rain lashed against the window of Amelia Grace Holloway's tiny office, a rhythmic drumming that mirrored the anxiety churning in her stomach.  The air in the cramped space, perched precariously above Mrs. Miggins' bakery on Bleecker Street, was thick with the cloying scent of burnt sugar and Amelia's own rising panic.  Spread across her desk, amidst precarious stacks of invoices and receipts, lay the meticulously organized financial records of "Charming's Curios," a shop specializing in supposedly “authentic” shrunken heads and other oddities.  Amelia, a CPA with a penchant for order and a deep-seated fear of the unknown, had taken on the eccentric Mr. Charming as a client out of sheer desperation three months ago. Now, staring at a glaring discrepancy of $17,342.11, she realized it might have been a mistake.  The rhythmic clang of the shop bell downstairs signaled a customer, followed by Mr. Charming's boisterous greeting, a sound that usually brought a small measure of comfort to Amelia. Tonight, it only deepened the unsettling feeling that something was very, very wrong.
