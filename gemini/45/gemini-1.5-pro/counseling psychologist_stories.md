Rain lashed against the arched windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside his newest patient.  The room, nestled on the third floor of a converted Victorian house in the sleepy town of Oakhaven, Maine, was usually a sanctuary.  Thick Persian rugs softened the polished hardwood floors, a crackling fireplace chased away the lingering chill of the Maine autumn, and the scent of sandalwood incense hung faintly in the air. But tonight, the comforting ambiance seemed to do little to soothe the palpable tension radiating from the woman perched rigidly on the edge of the plush velvet armchair. Elias, his brow furrowed with concern, observed her through the soft lamplight, the rhythmic tick of the grandfather clock in the corner punctuating the silence between them.  Oakhaven, with its picturesque harbor and close-knit community, rarely saw such visible distress.  He waited patiently, allowing the silence to stretch, knowing that sometimes the most potent therapy began in the unspoken words.
