The flickering gaslights of the Moulin Rouge cast an eerie glow on the cobbled streets of Montmartre, Paris, 1899.  A chill wind whipped around the ankles of Antoinette Dubois, sending the hem of her emerald green gown swirling around her like a restless spirit.  Antoinette, her breath misting in the cold air, clutched her worn leather music case tighter, the chill seeping through her thin shawl.  Tonight was the night.  Tonight, she, Antoinette Dubois, the little sparrow from the back alleys of Belleville, would finally sing on the hallowed stage of the Moulin Rouge.  The posters plastered across the city, proclaiming her name in bold, crimson letters, seemed almost surreal.  But the flutter of nervous anticipation in her stomach was very real indeed.  The clatter of a nearby carriage and the raucous laughter spilling out from a nearby bistro did little to calm her trembling hands.  This was her chance, the one she had dreamed of since she was a girl, humming melodies to herself while mending stockings by the dim light of a single candle. Tonight, her voice, her passion, her very soul, would be laid bare beneath the bright lights of the Moulin Rouge.
