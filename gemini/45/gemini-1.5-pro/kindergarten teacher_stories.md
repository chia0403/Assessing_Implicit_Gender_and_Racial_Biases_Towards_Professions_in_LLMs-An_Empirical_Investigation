The insistent chirping of a rogue cricket, somehow trapped inside Ms. Eleanor Vance's classroom, underscored the otherwise peaceful quiet of the Sunday afternoon.  Sunbeams, thick with dust motes, slanted through the large windows of the Rainbow Room at Sunny Meadow Elementary, illuminating the miniature world within. Tiny chairs sat upside down on brightly coloured tables, awaiting the energetic return of their small occupants.  Construction paper creations, vibrant and slightly lopsided, clung to the walls with varying degrees of success.  A faint, sweet smell of dried paint and playdough lingered in the air, a comforting aroma only a kindergarten classroom could truly possess.  Outside, the sleepy town of Havenwood, nestled in the heart of the Vermont countryside, basked in the golden light of an early autumn afternoon.
