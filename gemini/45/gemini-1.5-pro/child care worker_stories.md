The fluorescent lights of the "Little Wonders Daycare" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Reyes's Tuesday morning. Rain lashed against the large, rainbow-painted windows, blurring the view of the usually vibrant playground into a swirling grey canvas. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of disinfectant and the faint, sugary aroma of apple juice. Toys lay scattered across the brightly coloured rug, a testament to the morning's energetic play session.  Amelia, perched on a tiny blue chair amidst the chaos, was patiently mediating a dispute over a particularly coveted red firetruck between four-year-old Leo, whose face was crumpled in a storm of tears, and equally distraught Maya, clutching the truck like a lifeline. Outside, the wind howled, mirroring the miniature tempest brewing within the daycare's pastel-painted walls.
