Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Bartholomew "Barty" Finch's bookkeeping office, a rhythmic drumming that mirrored the dull ache behind his eyes.  The office, tucked between a perpetually closed fortune teller's parlor and a struggling laundromat in the perpetually damp port town of Aethelburg, was small and cluttered.  Ledgers, stacked precariously high, threatened to topple like dominoes with any sudden movement. The air hung thick with the scent of aging paper, cheap ink, and the faintly metallic tang of the nearby sea.  A single, flickering gas lamp cast long, dancing shadows that distorted the already cramped space, making the overflowing filing cabinets look like looming spectres. Barty, a man of meticulous habits and quiet desperation, hunched over his desk, a green visor perched precariously on his nose as he painstakingly recorded the latest shipment of codfish into his ledger. Outside, the wind howled, a mournful cry that echoed the growing unease in Barty’s heart. Something wasn’t adding up, and it wasn't just the numbers.
