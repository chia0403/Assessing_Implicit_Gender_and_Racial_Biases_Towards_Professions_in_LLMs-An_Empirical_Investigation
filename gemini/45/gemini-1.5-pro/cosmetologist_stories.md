The pungent aroma of perm solution mingled with the sweet scent of hairspray, creating a chemical cocktail that hung heavy in the air of "Shear Perfection." Rain lashed against the large front window, blurring the neon "Open" sign and reflecting the fluorescent lights that buzzed overhead.  Tuesday afternoons were usually slow, but today, the salon was deserted.  Elara Josephine Bellweather, a cosmetologist with a flair for the dramatic and a steady hand with a pair of shears, tapped her long, acrylic nails against the worn countertop, gazing out at the downpour. The rhythmic drumming was the only sound besides the murmur of the radio playing softly in the back room.  She was alone, save for the company of a half-finished cup of lukewarm coffee and the mannequin head in the corner, its synthetic hair styled in an elaborate updo Elara had been practicing for the upcoming regional hairdressing competition.  The small town of Harmony Glade, nestled in the heart of the Appalachian Mountains, rarely saw excitement, but Elara was determined to bring home the gold, one perfectly coiffed hair at a time.
