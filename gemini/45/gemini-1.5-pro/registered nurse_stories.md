The relentless Oregon rain hammered against the windows of the St. Jude's Hospital break room, blurring the already fading twilight. Inside, Eleanor Vance, RN, peeled off her latex gloves, the familiar snap echoing the tension thrumming in her temples.  Flu season had hit Astoria hard this year, turning the usually quiet coastal town into a symphony of coughs and wheezes. The break room, normally a haven of shared gossip and lukewarm coffee, now held a heavy silence, punctuated only by the rhythmic beeping of IV monitors filtering in from the hallway.  Eleanor rubbed her tired eyes, the fluorescent lights amplifying the dark circles beneath them.  She had been on her feet for twelve hours, and another double shift loomed ahead.  The scent of antiseptic clung to her skin, a stark reminder of the relentless battle against the invisible enemy ravaging the small community she called home. The relentless rain seemed to mirror the endless tide of patients, each one a fragile vessel battling the storm within.
