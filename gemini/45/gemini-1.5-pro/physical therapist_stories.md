The biting November wind whipped off Lake Michigan, rattling the oversized windows of Rejuvenate Physical Therapy and sending a shiver down Dr. Elias Thorne's spine.  He adjusted the thermostat, wincing at the groan of the ancient heating system, a familiar sound in the otherwise pristine clinic. Located in a converted Victorian house on a quiet, tree-lined street in Evanston, Illinois, the clinic exuded a warmth that belied the icy weather outside.  Elias, his name embroidered in crisp white letters on his navy polo shirt, surveyed the space with a practiced eye.  The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the exercise equipment, the polished wooden floors gleaming under the soft light. He was alone, save for the rhythmic whir of the ultrasound machine in the treatment room and the quiet tapping of his own fingers against his clipboard as he reviewed Mrs. Petrov’s latest progress notes.  The scent of antiseptic wipes mingled with the lingering aroma of cinnamon from the diffuser he’d plugged in earlier, creating a strangely comforting atmosphere. The day had been long, a steady stream of patients with varying ailments, from a high school athlete with a torn rotator cuff to an elderly woman recovering from a hip replacement.  But Elias loved it, the challenge of piecing broken bodies back together, the satisfaction of witnessing the gradual return of strength and mobility.  He was just capping his pen, preparing to lock up for the night, when the front door chimed, its cheerful jingle jarring him from his thoughts.
