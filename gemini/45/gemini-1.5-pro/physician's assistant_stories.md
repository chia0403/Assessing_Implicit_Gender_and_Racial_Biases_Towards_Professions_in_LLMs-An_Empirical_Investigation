Rain lashed against the windows of the small clinic, mirroring the relentless drumming in Elias Thorne's chest.  The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow over the worn examination tables and chipped linoleum floor.  Elias, a physician's assistant with a perpetually rumpled appearance and a tired kindness in his eyes, rubbed a hand down his face, leaving a streak of antiseptic gel across his cheek. He was the only medical professional on duty tonight at the Hopewell Community Clinic, nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, rattling the rusted sign that read "Open Late - We Care." Elias hoped that tonight, "late" wouldn't be *too* late. The last patient, a logger with a nasty splinter, had just left, leaving a lingering scent of pine and damp earth in the air.  The clock ticked past 11 pm, and Elias was just starting to contemplate a lukewarm cup of instant coffee when the clinic door burst open, revealing a figure drenched to the bone and carrying a limp form in their arms.
