The rusty clang of a dropped wrench echoed through the cavernous garage, swallowed up by the symphony of hissing pneumatics and grinding metal. Grease stained the concrete floor a mottled black, reflecting the weak November sun filtering through grimy skylights.  This was the domain of Beatrice "Bea" Rodriguez, a woman whose hands, perpetually smudged with oil and nicked from countless encounters with sharp edges, moved with a surgeon's precision under the hood of a cherry-red '67 Mustang.  Rodriguez's Garage, a ramshackle building tucked away on the outskirts of Dustbowl, Nevada, was more than just a place of business; it was Bea's sanctuary, a testament to her grit and a refuge from the dust devils and secrets that swirled through the desolate town. The air hung heavy with the scent of gasoline, burnt rubber, and the faint, lingering aroma of Bea's perpetually brewing coffee â€“ a potent blend she swore could resurrect even the most stubborn of engines.  This morning, however, the usual hum of activity was absent.  An unsettling quiet had settled over the garage, broken only by the rhythmic tick-tock of the vintage clock hanging above Bea's workbench. It was the quiet before a storm, and Bea, with a wrench still clutched in her hand, had a feeling it was heading straight for her.
