The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Dr. Elias Thorne's chiropractic clinic, a rhythmic drumming that mirrored the throbbing headache building behind his own eyes.  The clinic, nestled between a laundromat with perpetually flashing "Open 24 Hours" signs and a dusty antique shop promising "Treasures Within," sat on the quieter end of Elm Street in the small, perpetually overcast town of Port Blossom, Oregon.  Salt spray hung heavy in the air, clinging to the windowpanes and obscuring the already fading light of the late November afternoon. Inside, the waiting room, usually bustling with the aches and pains of Port Blossom's residents, was eerily silent. Only the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock in the corner and the hiss of the radiator punctuated the downpour's relentless percussion.  Elias, his tie loosened and his white coat slung over the back of his worn leather chair, stared at the appointment book, its blank pages a stark reflection of the unsettling quiet that had fallen over his practice, and indeed, over Port Blossom itself, in the last few weeks.
