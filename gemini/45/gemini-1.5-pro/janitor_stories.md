The flickering fluorescent lights of the Zenith Laboratories sub-basement buzzed like trapped insects, casting long, skeletal shadows from the overflowing bins lining the corridor.  It was 3:17 AM, the witching hour in the otherwise sterile, gleaming world above. Down here, amongst the discarded Petri dishes and expired chemical reagents, time seemed to stagnate, thick and heavy like the cloying scent of disinfectant. Elias Finch, his name tag slightly askew on his faded blue uniform, pushed his mop bucket with a weary sigh. The squeak of its wheels was the only sound besides the hypnotic hum of the lights and the occasional drip from a leaky pipe. Zenith Labs was supposedly the pinnacle of scientific advancement, researching everything from revolutionary cancer treatments to synthetic food sources.  But down here, in the belly of the beast, it felt more like a forgotten crypt, a repository of broken promises and discarded dreams.  Elias, however, knew better than to judge a book by its gleaming, stainless-steel cover.  He'd seen things in this sub-basement, things that shimmered beneath the grime and whispered secrets in the dead of night.  Things the scientists upstairs wouldn't – or couldn't – believe.
