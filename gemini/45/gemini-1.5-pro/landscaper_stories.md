The biting wind whipped Amelia "Mia" Rodriguez's dark braid across her face as she surveyed the overgrown monstrosity that was the Vandergelt estate.  Wrought iron gates, rusted with neglect, hung open like broken teeth, revealing a drive choked with weeds and flanked by gnarled, untamed rhododendrons.  November in the Hudson Valley had stripped the trees bare, leaving their skeletal branches clawing at the grey sky. The grand Victorian house, once the jewel of this sleepy, upscale town of Bellbridge, loomed over the scene like a gothic dowager, its paint peeling and windows dark. Mia pulled her thick knit cap further down over her ears and exhaled, a puff of white against the frigid air.  This was going to be a bigger project than she’d anticipated.  Mr. Vandergelt's email had mentioned "a bit of tidying," but this was a full-blown reclamation project.  Still, the hefty down payment he'd wired practically before she’d finished her initial site visit had been persuasive.  And a challenge, frankly, was exactly what Mia needed.
