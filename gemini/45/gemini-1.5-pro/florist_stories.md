The bell above the door of "Petal & Stem" chimed a melancholic two-note tune as the last customer of the day departed, leaving Elias Thorne alone amongst the buckets of hydrangeas and the heady scent of lilies. Rain lashed against the large storefront window, mirroring the torrent of Elias's thoughts.  Petal & Stem, nestled on a quiet cobbled street in the heart of Victorian-era London, was more than just a flower shop; it was his sanctuary, a vibrant splash of colour in a city often shrouded in fog and soot.  But lately, even the vibrant hues of his blooms couldn't dispel the growing unease that clung to him like the damp London air.  Something was different, a shift in the familiar rhythm of the city, a subtle disquiet that Elias couldn’t quite place. It started with the whispers, hushed conversations he’d overheard in the market, talk of strange occurrences, disappearances, and a darkness blooming in the shadows of the city.
