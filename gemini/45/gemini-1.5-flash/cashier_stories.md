The fluorescent lights of "Quick Stop Mart" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Hernandez's Tuesday night.  Amelia, at twenty-three, already felt the weight of the world pressing down on her shoulders, a weight amplified tenfold by the sticky linoleum floor and the incessant beeping of the scanner.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee, microwave popcorn, and desperation â€“ a familiar aroma for anyone who'd worked the night shift at a convenience store. Outside, the relentless Texas wind howled a mournful counterpoint to the hum of the refrigerators, rattling the already-loose window panes.  Rain lashed against the glass, blurring the neon glow of the nearby motel sign into a hazy, indistinct smear.  Another customer shuffled in, their silhouette a dark smudge against the brightly lit interior, and Amelia braced herself for the next transaction, already anticipating the inevitable crumpled dollar bill and the request for a lottery ticket.
