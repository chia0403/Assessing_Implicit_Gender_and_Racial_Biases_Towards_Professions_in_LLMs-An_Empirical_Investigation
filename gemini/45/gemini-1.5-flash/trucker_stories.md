The diesel engine coughed, a guttural rumble that vibrated through Jedediah "Jed" Stone's worn leather boots.  He gripped the steering wheel of his eighteen-wheeler, "The Wandering Star," its chrome gleaming faintly under the bruised purple of a twilight sky threatening rain.  The air hung heavy and humid, thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, the kind of air that clung to the back roads of the Appalachian Mountains like a shroud.  Jed squinted at the ribbon of asphalt snaking ahead, barely visible in the deepening shadows. He was miles from anywhere, lost somewhere between Asheville and Knoxville, the map in his lap crumpled and useless after a sudden downpour had turned it into a soggy mess.  The only sound besides his truck's engine was the rhythmic whisper of tires on the wet road and the incessant chirping of unseen crickets.  This was his life – solitude, miles of empty highway, and the constant hum of the engine – a life he wouldn’t trade for anything, despite the current predicament.
