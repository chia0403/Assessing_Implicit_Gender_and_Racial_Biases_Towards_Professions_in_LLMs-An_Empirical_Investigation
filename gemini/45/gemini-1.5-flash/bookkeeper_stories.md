The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Katherine Finch's hands, the lukewarm tea doing little to thaw the icy grip of the November wind that howled outside.  Rain lashed against the leaded-glass windows of her office, blurring the already indistinct gaslight glow of the cobbled street below.  Amelia, a bookkeeper of meticulous habit and even more meticulous accounts, sat hunched over her ledger, the faint scent of dried ink and damp wool clinging to the air around her.  Her small, cluttered office, perched atop a crumbling Victorian building in the heart of Grimsborough's less salubrious district, offered little in the way of comfort, but it was hers â€“ a sanctuary of ruled lines and precisely balanced columns, a refuge from the chaos that seemed to perpetually swirl just beyond its threshold.  The only illumination besides the gaslight came from a single, flickering candle illuminating the meticulous script of her entries.  Tonight, however, even the rhythmic scratching of her quill felt discordant, a counterpoint to the unsettling tremor in her hand.  For something was profoundly wrong with Mr. Silas Blackwood's accounts.
