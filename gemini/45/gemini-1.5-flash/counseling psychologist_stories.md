The chipped paint of Dr. Eleanor Vance's waiting room was a testament to its age, a muted teal that had faded to the colour of a bruised plum.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single, slightly askew overhead light, danced in the afternoon sun that slanted through the dusty windowpanes.  The air hung heavy with the scent of old books and something vaguely floral, a perfume clinging tenaciously to the worn velvet armchair where Eleanor herself sat, nursing a lukewarm cup of chamomile tea.  Outside, the relentless rhythm of New York City pulsed – a low thrum of car horns and distant sirens – a stark contrast to the quiet, almost suffocating stillness within her small, cluttered office on the third floor of a brownstone building on West 81st Street.  The silence, however, was about to be broken.  A hesitant knock echoed through the room, a prelude to the anxieties, secrets, and fractured lives that would soon fill her day.
