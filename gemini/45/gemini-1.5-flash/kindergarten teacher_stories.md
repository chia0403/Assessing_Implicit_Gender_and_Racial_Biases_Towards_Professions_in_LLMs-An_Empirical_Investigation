The chipped paint of Ms. Eleanor Vance's classroom smelled faintly of glue, glitter, and the lingering ghost of a thousand spilled juice boxes.  Sunlight, fractured by the rainbow-colored mobiles swaying gently from the ceiling, painted stripes across the miniature tables and chairs.  Outside, the November wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the windows of Sunnyside Kindergarten, a tune that was completely lost on the twenty-five five-year-olds currently engaged in a spirited, if slightly chaotic, construction project involving blocks, blankets, and a surprisingly realistic papier-mâché dinosaur named "Terry."  Eleanor Vance, a woman whose smile lines spoke of years spent navigating the unpredictable currents of childhood, watched them with a fondness that bordered on reverence.  Today, however, a different kind of storm was brewing, a storm far more unsettling than the wind outside.  A storm that wouldn't be appeased with a juice box and a cuddle.
