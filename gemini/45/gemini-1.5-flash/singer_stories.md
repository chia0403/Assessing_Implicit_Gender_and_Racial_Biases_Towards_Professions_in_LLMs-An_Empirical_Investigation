The chipped paint of the backstage door flaked under Seraphina "Sera" Nightingale's fingertips, mirroring the anxieties fluttering in her stomach.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale beer, cheap perfume, and the nervous sweat of a hundred hopefuls crammed into the dimly lit corridor of the "Rusty Mug," a dive bar in the perpetually rain-slicked alleyways of Prague's Žižkov district.  Outside, the relentless drumming of the city – trams screeching, car horns blaring, a distant accordion wailing a melancholic tune – competed with the nervous chatter and amplified thump of the band currently holding court on stage.  Tonight, Sera Nightingale, a singer with a voice that could melt glaciers and a heart full of cracks, would finally get her chance.  This was more than just a gig; it was a lifeline.
