The greasy overalls clung to Amelia "Amy" Hernandez's lean frame like a second skin, the scent of motor oil a familiar perfume that clung to her even after a shower.  Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of Hernandez Auto Repair, a small, family-run business tucked precariously between a laundromat smelling faintly of bleach and a perpetually overflowing dumpster behind a taco stand.  Neon signs flickered intermittently in the downpour, casting long, wavering shadows across the chaotic landscape of discarded tires, rusting mufflers, and half-dismantled engines that littered the yard.  The air hung thick with the metallic tang of oil and the sharp, spicy aroma of al pastor from the taco stand next door – a strangely comforting mix that Amy had come to associate with the rhythm of her life.  Tonight, however, the comforting hum of the usual Friday night chaos was replaced by an unnerving silence, broken only by the relentless drumming of the rain and the occasional crackle of the dying neon.  This wasn't just a quiet night; something felt…wrong.
