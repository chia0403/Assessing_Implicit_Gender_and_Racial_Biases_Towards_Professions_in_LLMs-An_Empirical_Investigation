The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of blood, iron, and sawdust, a perfume as familiar to Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield as the smell of his own skin.  It clung to him, a greasy, crimson shroud, even after the meticulous scrub with lye soap and stiff bristle brush.  Barty stood in his shop, Butterfield's Best, a butcher's establishment that had been a fixture on the cobbled streets of Oakhaven for three generations. Oakhaven itself was a town clinging precariously to the edge of the Whispering Woods, a place where the sun seemed reluctant to fully penetrate the perpetual gloom cast by the ancient, gnarled trees.  The shop, a low-slung building of grey stone, was bathed in the weak, watery light filtering through the single grimy window, illuminating the rows of hanging sausages, the glistening cuts of beef, and the ominous gleam of Barty's cleaver, resting on a blood-stained block.  Tonight, however, even the familiar smells seemed off, subtly tainted by something acrid and unsettling, something that made the hairs on the back of Barty's neck prickle with a premonition he couldn't quite name.
