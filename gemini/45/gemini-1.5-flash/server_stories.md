The chipped Formica tabletop vibrated faintly under the weight of Amelia Hernandez's forearm.  The clatter of cutlery and the low hum of conversation formed a familiar, almost comforting background noise in the perpetually twilight interior of "The Gilded Lily," a diner clinging precariously to life on the wrong side of the tracks in the forgotten corner of Oakhaven.  Rain lashed against the greasy windows, blurring the neon glow of the liquor store across the street into a hazy, psychedelic smear.  The air inside hung heavy with the smells of stale coffee, frying bacon, and the faint, lingering scent of desperation.  Amelia, her name embroidered crookedly on the breast pocket of her stained apron, sighed, a thin wisp of air lost in the general clamor.  Tonight, like every other night, felt like a slow, relentless slide into oblivion.
