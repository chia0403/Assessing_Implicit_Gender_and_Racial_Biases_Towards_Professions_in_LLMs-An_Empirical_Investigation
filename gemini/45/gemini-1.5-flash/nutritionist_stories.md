The chipped paint of the fire escape flaked onto Dr. Eleanor Vance’s sensible brown shoes, each tiny flake a miniature reminder of the crumbling building that housed her practice.  Eleanor Vance, PhD, Registered Dietitian, stared out at the grimy vista of Brooklyn’s Bushwick neighborhood, a tapestry woven from graffiti-covered brick, overflowing dumpsters, and the surprisingly vibrant green shoots pushing through cracks in the pavement.  The air, thick with the scent of frying plantains and exhaust fumes, hummed with the chaotic energy of a thousand lives unfolding below.  Her tiny, sun-drenched office, barely bigger than a walk-in closet, offered a stark contrast to the gritty reality outside.  Inside, the scent of freshly brewed chamomile tea battled valiantly against the pervasive urban aroma, a tiny act of defiance in a city that often felt overwhelming.  This morning, however, even the calming chamomile couldn't quite soothe the knot of anxiety tightening in her stomach.  A new client was arriving, one with a reputation as formidable as the city itself.
