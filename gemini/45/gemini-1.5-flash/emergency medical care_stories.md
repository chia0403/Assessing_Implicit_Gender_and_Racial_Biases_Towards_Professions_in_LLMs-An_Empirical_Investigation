The biting November wind whipped Amelia Hernandez’s dark hair across her face as she wrestled the heavy back door of the ambulance open.  Rain, a relentless, sideways onslaught, plastered her already damp uniform to her skin.  The air tasted of salt, diesel fumes, and something vaguely metallic – a scent she’d come to associate with the unpredictable tapestry of human suffering that unfurled nightly on the rain-slicked streets of San Francisco.  Amelia, a paramedic with three years of experience etched onto her tired but determined face, adjusted her headlamp, its beam cutting a wavering path through the gloom that clung to the narrow alley. The flickering neon sign of a dilapidated liquor store cast an anemic glow on the scene before her: a crumpled figure lying half-submerged in a pool of something suspiciously crimson, the sickly sweet smell of blood heavy in the damp air.  This wasn't her first rodeo, but the raw, visceral energy of this particular emergency pulsed with a chilling familiarity that sent a shiver down her spine.  Tonight, she suspected, would be a long one.
