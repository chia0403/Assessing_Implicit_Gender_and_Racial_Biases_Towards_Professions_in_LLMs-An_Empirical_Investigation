The salt spray stung Amelia Hernandez's face as she hauled the last crate of glistening, ice-packed mackerel onto the rickety dock.  The air, thick with the tang of brine and the distant, sweet scent of frying fish from the nearby taverns, whipped her dark hair across her eyes.  Amelia, her hands raw and chapped despite the thick woolen gloves, straightened, her back protesting with a familiar groan.  The setting sun cast long shadows across the cobbled streets of Port Blossom, a tiny fishing village clinging precariously to the rugged cliffs of the Emerald Coast.  The only sounds louder than the crashing waves were the cries of gulls and the rhythmic clang of hammers from the shipyard, a constant percussion to the symphony of the sea.  Tonight, however, Amelia's symphony wouldn't be dictated by the ocean; it would be orchestrated in her own small, bustling kitchen, where the aroma of her famous seafood stew would soon fill the air, promising warmth and comfort to the weary fishermen returning from the unforgiving sea.
