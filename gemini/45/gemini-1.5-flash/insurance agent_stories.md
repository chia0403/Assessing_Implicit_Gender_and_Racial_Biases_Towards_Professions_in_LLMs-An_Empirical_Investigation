The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Hernandezâ€™s hands, the lukewarm coffee doing little to chase away the pre-dawn chill that clung to the air in her cramped, second-floor office.  Rain lashed against the single, grimy window of her agency, "Hernandez & Hernandez Insurance," a name that once held the weight of familial legacy but now felt more like a tombstone.  The street below, usually a chaotic symphony of honking taxis and chattering vendors in the vibrant heart of Santo Domingo, was hushed and subdued, the city seemingly holding its breath beneath the relentless downpour.  Inside, the only sound besides the drumming rain was the rhythmic ticking of the ancient grandfather clock in the corner, each tick a morbid reminder of the dwindling hours before her crucial meeting with Mr. Rafael Alvarez, a notoriously difficult client whose coffee plantation had suffered a devastating storm.  Amelia swirled the remaining coffee, the dark liquid mirroring the storm clouds gathering outside, and braced herself for another day battling both the elements and the capricious nature of insurance claims.
