The scent of rain-soaked petrichor mingled with the heady perfume of lilies and roses, a strangely intoxicating combination that clung to the air around "Petal Pushers," Amelia Katherine Hawthorne's small but beloved florist shop.  The shop itself was a charmingly chaotic explosion of color nestled on a cobbled side street in the ancient, cliff-hung town of Seabrook.  Rain lashed against the leaded windows, blurring the already hazy gaslight glow spilling from the nearby pub, "The Salty Siren."  Inside, Amelia, her hands stained a vibrant mix of greens and purples from handling vibrant hydrangeas, hummed a jaunty sea shanty as she carefully arranged a cascade of orchids for a wedding later that day.  The shopâ€™s bell, a tarnished brass thing that chimed with a melancholic sigh, announced a new arrival, shattering the peaceful rhythm of her work.
