The chipped paint of Agnes Periwinkle’s desk matched the general air of faded grandeur in the Blackwood & Sons law offices. Dust motes, illuminated by the weak afternoon sun slanting through the grimy windowpanes, danced in the stagnant air, a silent ballet to the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Agnes’s perfectly manicured fingernails on the typewriter keys.  The year was 1953, and the scent of aged paper, stale coffee, and the faint, unsettling perfume of Mrs. Hawthorne, the senior partner’s imperious wife (who never failed to stop by for a "chat" that invariably involved criticizing Agnes's posture), hung heavy in the air.  Outside, the London fog clung to the cobbled streets like a damp shroud, muffling the sounds of the city into a low, persistent hum.  Agnes, however, remained oblivious to the gloomy atmosphere, her concentration fixed on the complex legal document before her, her brow furrowed in concentration.
