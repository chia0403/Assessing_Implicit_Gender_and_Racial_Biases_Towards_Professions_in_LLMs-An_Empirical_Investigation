The brass nameplate on the mahogany desk gleamed under the soft, amber light of the Grand Bellini Hotel lobby:  *Augustus "Gus" Blackwood, Concierge*.  Gus, however, wasn’t admiring his own polished reflection. Instead, he was staring intently at a single, wilting orchid, its purple petals drooping like a forlorn opera singer after a disastrous performance.  The air in the Bellini, usually thick with the scent of expensive perfume and even more expensive cigars, was strangely still, a pre-storm calm that prickled his skin.  Rain lashed against the vast, arched windows overlooking the Piazza San Marco, a relentless drumming that mirrored the frantic beat of his own heart.  This wasn't just another late-night request; this was something… different.  The note clutched in his hand, penned in elegant, spidery script, promised both exquisite reward and terrifying consequences.  Tonight, Gus Blackwood wasn't just fulfilling a guest's whim; he was walking into a mystery far beyond the gilded cages of the Bellini.
