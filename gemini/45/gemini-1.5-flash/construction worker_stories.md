The biting November wind whipped at Elias Thorne's already chapped lips, stinging them like a swarm of angry wasps.  He pulled his threadbare scarf higher, the wool scratchy against his stubbled chin, and surveyed the skeletal frame of the new skyscraper piercing the grey Glasgow sky.  Rain, a constant companion in this city, plastered his dark hair to his forehead, and the steel girders, slick with moisture, gleamed under the bruised light of the late afternoon.  Below, the city hummed â€“ a low, persistent thrum of traffic, distant sirens, and the rhythmic clang of other construction sites mirroring the symphony of steel echoing from his own.  Elias, a veteran of twenty years on the scaffolding, felt the familiar twinge in his back, a testament to a life spent defying gravity and building the city's concrete dreams.
