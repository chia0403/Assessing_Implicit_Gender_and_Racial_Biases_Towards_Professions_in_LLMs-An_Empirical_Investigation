The salt spray stung Amelia Hernandez’s face as she wrestled the stubborn fishing net free from the tangled seaweed.  The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum in the rapidly darkening sky, cast long shadows across the rocky cove of Port Blossom.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and decaying kelp, carried the mournful cry of gulls overhead. Amelia, her hands raw and chapped despite the thick work gloves, finally heaved the net onto the rocks with a grunt.  She wasn’t used to this kind of manual labor, her usual tools being far less…organic.  As a physical therapist with a thriving practice in the quaint coastal town, Amelia’s days were typically filled with the rhythmic clicks of her assessment tools and the encouraging murmurs of patients regaining their mobility.  But today, she’d traded her ergonomic chair for the unforgiving grip of the sea.
