This wasn't the charming, slightly dilapidated elegance she'd anticipated from the photographs; this was something else entirely â€“ something shadowed and unsettling, a house that seemed to hold its breath, waiting.  The grand hall, once undoubtedly breathtaking, now felt oppressive, the grandeur swallowed by decades of neglect and the lingering presence of a past she couldn't quite grasp.
