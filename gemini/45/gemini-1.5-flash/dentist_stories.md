The rhythmic whir of the drill, usually a comforting hum to Dr. Eleanor Vance, felt discordant tonight.  Rain lashed against the windows of her practice, a relentless drumming that mirrored the frantic beat of her own heart.  Eleanor Vance, D.D.S., sat alone in her otherwise spotless office, the sterile scent of antiseptic doing little to mask the metallic tang of blood clinging to the air.  The clock on the wall ticked with agonizing slowness, each second a tiny hammer blow against the silence that followed the storm's fury. Outside, the usually vibrant streets of Oakhaven, Connecticut, were plunged into darkness, the power lines downed by the ferocious wind.  Inside, a single lamp illuminated the stainless steel instruments scattered across her desk, stark reminders of the evening's unsettling events.
