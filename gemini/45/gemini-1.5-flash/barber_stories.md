The air hung thick and sweet with the scent of bay rum and burnt sugar, a familiar perfume to Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, proprietor of Butterfield's Barbershop.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grime-coated window of his tiny shop, illuminating the faded, chipped paint of the walls and the worn leather of his barber's chair.  Outside, the relentless rhythm of the city – the screech of brakes, the blare of horns, the distant wail of a siren – was muted to a dull roar by the thick, sound-absorbing walls of the building, a relic from a bygone era nestled incongruously amongst the sleek glass and steel towers of modern New Birmingham.  Barty hummed a low, mournful tune as he meticulously sharpened his straight razor, the rhythmic scrape a counterpoint to the city's discordant symphony.  His shop, a tiny island of calm in a sea of chaos, was his sanctuary, his kingdom, his battlefield.
