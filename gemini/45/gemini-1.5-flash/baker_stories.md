The pre-dawn chill clung to Amelia Katherine Hawthorne like a damp linen shroud as she unlocked the bakery doors.  Frost, delicate as spun sugar, clung to the windowpanes of "The Gilded Whisk," blurring the already dim streetlights of Oakhaven, a town so quaint it bordered on cliché.  Cobblestone streets, gas lamps casting a sickly yellow glow, and the ever-present scent of woodsmoke and brewing coffee – Oakhaven was a postcard come to life, if that postcard had a slightly melancholic undertone.  Inside, the air was warmer, filled with the comforting aroma of yeast and rising bread, a fragrant counterpoint to the winter's bite.  Amelia, her breath misting in the air, pulled on her apron, the familiar weight a comforting anchor in the quiet before the day's rush.  The rhythmic tick-tock of the old grandfather clock in the corner was the only sound louder than the gentle whoosh of the oven's pilot light.
