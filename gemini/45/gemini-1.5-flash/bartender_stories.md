The chipped Formica countertop felt cold beneath Elias Thorne's elbows.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows of "The Rusty Mug," a dive bar clinging precariously to the edge of the docks in the perpetually twilight city of Porthaven.  The air hung thick with the smell of stale beer, brine, and something indefinably fishy â€“ a scent Elias had come to associate less with the ocean and more with the lingering despair of the city itself.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune, punctuated by the sporadic clang of a ship's bell in the distance. Inside, the only sounds were the rhythmic clinking of ice in glasses and the low hum of conversation, punctuated by the occasional, frustrated sigh escaping the lips of a particularly disgruntled sailor.  Tonight, however, even the usual cacophony of The Rusty Mug felt muted, weighed down by a palpable sense of unease.  Elias wiped down the bar, the rag barely making a dent in the sticky residue left behind by countless pints and questionable spirits.  Another slow night in Porthaven. Or so it seemed.
