The biting November wind whipped Amelia Katherine Finch’s hair across her face, stinging her cheeks a rosy red that clashed spectacularly with the bruised purple of the twilight sky.  Amelia, or Mel as she preferred, hunched deeper into her worn wool coat, the collar scratching against her neck as she navigated the cobbled streets of the ancient port town of Port Blossom.  The air hung thick with the smell of brine and decaying seaweed, a familiar perfume that clung to everything in Port Blossom, from the weathered timbers of the fishing boats bobbing gently in the harbour to the peeling paint of the crooked, centuries-old houses that leaned precariously towards each other like gossiping neighbours.  Tonight, however, the usual salty tang was overlaid with a sharp, metallic scent – the scent of blood.  Amelia shivered, not entirely from the cold.  Her easel, strapped precariously to her back, felt heavy with the weight of unfinished canvases and the unspoken promise of a masterpiece yet to be born, a masterpiece that might never see the light of day if she didn't get back to her studio soon.
