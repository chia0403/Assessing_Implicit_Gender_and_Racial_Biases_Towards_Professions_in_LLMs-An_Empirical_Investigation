The biting November wind whipped Ms. Eleanor Vance's auburn hair across her face as she hurried down Elm Street, the collar of her tweed coat pulled high.  Autumn had surrendered its vibrant hues, leaving behind a landscape of skeletal trees clawing at a bruised grey sky.  Fallen leaves, plastered to the damp pavement like discarded memories, crunched under her worn leather boots.  The scent of woodsmoke, a comforting counterpoint to the chill, drifted from the chimneys of the quaint Victorian houses lining the street, each one a silent witness to generations of Oakhaven Elementary's students and their teachers.  Oakhaven itself, a small town nestled deep in the heart of Vermont, was a picture postcard of New England charm – if that postcard had a slightly faded and slightly melancholic hue, reflecting the long, looming winter ahead.  Tonight, however, Eleanor's thoughts weren't on the beauty of the season, or even the impending blizzard forecast.  They were consumed by the unsettling silence emanating from Room 12 – the room she had spent the last fifteen years transforming from a simple classroom into a haven of learning and laughter. And tonight, it felt anything but haven-like.
