The wind, a relentless sculptor, carved patterns into the snowdrifts that piled high against the weathered fenceposts of the Bar None Ranch.  A biting December wind whistled through the skeletal branches of the cottonwoods, carrying with it the scent of pine and the faint, metallic tang of frozen earth.  The sun, a weak, watery orb barely visible through the swirling grey clouds, offered little warmth.  Elias "Eli"  McClellan, a man etched by the sun and hardened by the unforgiving Wyoming winters, squinted against the glare.  His breath plumed out before him, a fleeting white ghost in the frigid air, as he surveyed his kingdom â€“ a sprawling expanse of land blanketed in snow, punctuated by the dark silhouettes of his hardy Hereford cattle.  The ranch house, a sturdy two-story structure of rough-hewn logs, huddled protectively against the elements, a beacon of warmth and resilience in the desolate landscape.  This was his life, this unforgiving beauty, and Eli wouldn't have it any other way.
