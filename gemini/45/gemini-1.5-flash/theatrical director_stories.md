The stale scent of sawdust and forgotten dreams clung to the air in the dilapidated theatre, a perfume only Isabella “Izzy” Moreau truly appreciated.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single bare bulb hanging precariously above, danced in the sluggish currents of air that snaked through the cavernous space.  Izzy, her sharp chin resting on a hand adorned with rings that clinked softly against the worn velvet of her director's chair, surveyed the scene with a practiced, critical eye.  The Grand Majestic Theatre, once a jewel of the city, now stood as a crumbling testament to a bygone era of glamour – a perfect canvas, she thought, for her ambitious, and perhaps foolhardy, new production of "Macbeth."  The chipped paint of the proscenium arch seemed to mock her, whispering tales of forgotten triumphs and spectacular failures.  Tonight, however, Izzy intended to add a new chapter to the Grand Majestic's history, a chapter written in blood, sweat, and possibly a little bit of theatrical magic.
