The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Amy” Hernandez’s hair across her face as she surveyed the rain-slicked soccer field.  Floodlights cut through the gloom, illuminating the skeletal branches of the ancient oak trees that lined the perimeter of the West Haven High School grounds.  A lone raven perched on one, its obsidian eyes gleaming like polished stones in the artificial light.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and the faint, almost forgotten, sweetness of decaying leaves.  Amy shivered, pulling her worn, navy blue track jacket tighter around her.  This wasn't exactly the idyllic setting she’d envisioned for her final game as head coach of the West Haven Wildcats, but then again, nothing about this season had been idyllic.
