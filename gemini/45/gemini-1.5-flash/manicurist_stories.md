The air in "Nails of Fortune" hung thick with the cloying sweetness of almond cuticle oil and the faint, metallic tang of blood.  Not *actual* blood, thankfully, though Esme Blackwood, manicurist extraordinaire, had seen her share of near-misses over the fifteen years she'd presided over this tiny, glittering salon tucked away on a cobbled side street in the heart of Prague's Old Town.  Outside, the Charles Bridge hummed with the afternoon rush of tourists, their chatter a muffled counterpoint to the whir of the electric file Esme wielded with practiced precision.  The chipped turquoise paint on the windowsill, a testament to a particularly clumsy client's mishap last week, caught the afternoon sun, transforming the tiny flecks into miniature sapphires.  Today, though, Esme wasn't focused on chipped polish. Today, something far more sinister than a rogue nail had caught her attention.
