The fluorescent lights of the Zenith Corporation hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Grace Hawthorne's day. Amelia, a woman whose neatly-pinned auburn bun mirrored the rigid order of her desk, sat perched on a surprisingly uncomfortable ergonomic chair.  The Zenith lobby, a sterile expanse of polished granite and chrome, shimmered under the afternoon sun streaming through the floor-to-ceiling windows.  Outside, the city of Chicago roared with a life Amelia only glimpsed through the glass â€“ a stark contrast to the hushed, almost reverent silence that permeated the reception area. The air conditioner, despite its whirring protest, struggled to combat the lingering scent of expensive leather and something faintly metallic, perhaps the faintest hint of fear. Today, however, the metallic scent was particularly sharp, a subtle undercurrent to the usual corporate aroma.  Amelia straightened her already impeccable posture, her gaze fixed on the swirling patterns of the polished granite floor. Something was different.  Something was about to happen.
