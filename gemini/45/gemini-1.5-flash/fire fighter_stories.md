The acrid bite of woodsmoke stung Lieutenant Evelyn "Evie" Reed's nostrils, a familiar companion on nights like these.  The moon, a sliver of chipped bone in the inky sky, cast long, skeletal shadows across the parched landscape surrounding the Whispering Pines campground.  Dry brush crackled underfoot, a symphony of impending doom, as Evie and her crew, silhouetted against the growing orange inferno that licked at the edge of the campground, fought a losing battle against the relentless flames.  The air throbbed with the roar of the fire, a monstrous beast fueled by weeks of unrelenting drought, its hungry maw consuming everything in its path.  The panicked shouts of campers, carried on the wind, were barely audible above the crackling inferno.  This wasn't just another brush fire; this was a full-blown conflagration, threatening to engulf the entire campground and spill over into the nearby town of Oakhaven.
