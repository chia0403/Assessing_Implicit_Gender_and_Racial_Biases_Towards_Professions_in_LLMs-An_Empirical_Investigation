The salt spray stung Amelia Katherine Blackwood’s face as she wrestled the stubborn fishing net onto the small, rocking boat.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and decaying seaweed, carried the mournful cry of gulls overhead.  Amelia, or Amy as most people – but very few people – called her, squinted at the churning grey expanse of the Atlantic.  The storm, a snarling beast that had ravaged the coast for three days, had finally begun to subside, leaving behind a landscape of splintered wood, tossed fishing gear, and a profound, unsettling stillness. This remote stretch of the Cornish coastline, usually a haven of peace and inspiration for Amy, felt anything but.  The tiny fishing village of Porthcurno, nestled between towering cliffs and a turbulent sea, held its breath, waiting to see what the tempest had left behind – and what it might yet unleash.  Amy, however, was more concerned with the churning chaos inside her own head than the storm outside. Her latest novel, a sprawling epic fantasy she'd foolishly titled "The Obsidian Tide," felt as hopelessly tangled and tempest-tossed as the sea before her.
