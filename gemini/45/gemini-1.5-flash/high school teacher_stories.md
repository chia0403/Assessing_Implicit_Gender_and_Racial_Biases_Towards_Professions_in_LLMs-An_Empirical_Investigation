The chipped paint of the "Welcome to Northwood High" sign flaked onto the already littered asphalt like a dying butterfly.  Rain, the kind that clung to you like a damp shroud, plastered Amelia “Mia” Hawthorne’s already unruly auburn curls to her scalp.  The November air tasted of woodsmoke and impending snow, a chilling prelude to the equally bleak feeling settling in her gut.  Mia, a veteran English teacher at Northwood – veteran in the sense that she’d survived seven years of grading essays fueled by lukewarm coffee and the faint hope of a decent pension – sighed, the sound swallowed by the relentless drumming of rain against her battered Honda Civic.  Inside, her ancient satchel slumped against the passenger seat, a weighty symbol of the looming stack of ungraded papers waiting for her. Northwood High, nestled in the perpetually overcast valley town of Oakhaven, felt more like a prison than a place of learning tonight.
