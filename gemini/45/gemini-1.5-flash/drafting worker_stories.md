The fluorescent lights of the drafting room hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Amelia Katherine Holloway’s pencil on the mylar.  Dust motes danced in the pale light, illuminated like tiny, glittering constellations against the backdrop of towering stacks of blueprints, their edges softened by years of use and countless revisions.  The air smelled faintly of stale coffee and the slightly acrid scent of drafting ink, a familiar fragrance that Amelia, after twenty years at the firm of Peterson & Sons Architectural Design, barely registered anymore.  Outside, the Chicago wind howled a mournful song, rattling the windows of the aging office building, a stark contrast to the quiet concentration Amelia maintained as she meticulously rendered the intricate details of a new high-rise development – a project that, if completed, would forever alter the city’s skyline.
