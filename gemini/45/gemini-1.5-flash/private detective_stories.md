The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Isabella “Izzy” Diaz’s office, a rhythm that mirrored the relentless pounding in her head.  The air hung thick and humid, carrying the scent of jasmine and something far less pleasant – stale cigarettes and desperation. Izzy, a private investigator whose office was less a sophisticated headquarters and more a cramped, cluttered room above a failing bakery in the heart of New Orleans’ French Quarter, rubbed her temples.  The chipped paint on the walls seemed to be mocking her; peeling flakes mirroring the layers of unresolved cases and unanswered questions that clung to her like the clinging Louisiana heat.  Outside, the vibrant chaos of Bourbon Street – a cacophony of jazz, laughter, and the whispered secrets of the night – was a stark contrast to the quiet desperation that filled her cramped sanctuary.  Tonight, however, the usual hum of the Quarter felt muted, subdued by the relentless downpour and the weight of her latest client's plea echoing in her ears.
