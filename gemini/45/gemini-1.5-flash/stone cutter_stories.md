The rasp of chisel on granite echoed through the valley, a lonely counterpoint to the mournful cry of a hawk circling high above.  Dust, the colour of faded ochre, motes in the afternoon sun, clung to everything in Elias Thorne’s workshop – his leathery apron, his calloused hands, the very air itself.  Elias, a man carved by the same relentless forces that shaped the mountains around him, squinted at his work.  The rough-hewn block before him, a behemoth of grey and white veined marble, was destined to become a funerary monument – a stark testament to the transient nature of life in the unforgiving landscape of the Cairngorms.  The wind, biting and sharp as a glacier's edge, whistled through the cracks in the workshop's stone walls, a constant reminder of the harsh beauty that both inspired and challenged him.
