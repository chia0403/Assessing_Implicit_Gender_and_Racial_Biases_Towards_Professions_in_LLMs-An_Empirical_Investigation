The scent of lavender and old silk hung heavy in the air, a comforting perfume that clung to the velvet curtains and the chipped porcelain dolls lining the shelves of Esme Eleanor Hawthorne's atelier. Dust motes danced in the slanted afternoon sunbeams that pierced the grime-coated windowpanes of her tiny shop, nestled on a cobbled side street in the heart of Prague's Old Town.  The street itself, a narrow ribbon winding between towering gothic buildings, hummed with the low thrum of the city â€“ the distant clang of a blacksmith's hammer, the murmur of conversations in Czech, the rhythmic clip-clop of horse-drawn carriages.  But within Esme's workshop, time seemed to slow, measured only by the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of her shears and the soft rustle of fabric as she worked.
