The biting November wind whipped Amelia Hernandez’s auburn hair across her face as she surveyed the desolate, windswept beach.  Grainy sand, the color of old bone, clung to her expensive Italian boots, a stark contrast to the sleek, black leather.  Above, the bruised purple sky threatened further rain, mirroring the storm brewing inside her. Amelia, renowned for her gritty, award-winning independent films, stood on the precipice of her most ambitious project yet – a sweeping epic about the legendary lost city of Eldoria, a tale whispered about in hushed tones by the dwindling fishermen of this remote Cornish coast.  The location, chosen for its raw, untamed beauty, felt more like a curse than a blessing tonight.  The air hung heavy with the salty tang of the sea and the ominous premonition that this film, like the mythical city itself, might remain forever elusive.
