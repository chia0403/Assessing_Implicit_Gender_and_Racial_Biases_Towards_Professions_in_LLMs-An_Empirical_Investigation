The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful song, whipping snow into frenzied dervishes around Captain Evelyn "Evie" Reed's battered Cessna 185.  Below, the Chugach Mountains, cloaked in a pristine, yet unforgiving, blanket of white, clawed at the bruised grey sky.  Visibility was down to near zero â€“ a swirling maelstrom of ice crystals and falling snow that swallowed the already meager light of the late afternoon sun. Evie, her breath misting in the frigid cockpit air, gripped the controls with knuckles bone-white against the worn leather. This wasn't just another flight; this was a lifeline, snaking its way through the treacherous heart of a winter storm towards a remote village clinging precariously to the edge of the world.
