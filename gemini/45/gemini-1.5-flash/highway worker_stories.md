The midday sun beat down on Elias Thorne's neck, baking the sweat already beading on his forehead into a sticky film.  He squinted, the glare reflecting off the endless ribbon of asphalt stretching before him like a shimmering, heat-hazed river.  The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of diesel fumes and hot tar, a familiar perfume to Elias, a perfume that clung to his skin and his clothes like a second shadow.  He was perched precariously on the edge of a freshly-laid patch of road, his orange work vest a vibrant splash of colour against the monotonous grey of the highway.  Around him, the vast, empty expanse of the New Mexico desert sprawled, broken only by the occasional scrubby bush and the distant, hazy outline of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, shimmering like mirages in the heat. This stretch of Interstate 40, miles from anywhere, was his kingdom, his solitary domain for the next eight hours.
