Amelia, her cheeks flushed crimson from the cold and exertion, paused, her breath misting in the frigid air.  The sanctuary, her sanctuary, was a place of both profound beauty and heartbreaking fragility, a constant reminder of the delicate balance between nature and the often-cruel hand of humanity.
