The biting wind whipped through the narrow cobblestone alleyway, tugging at the stained white apron of Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins. He shoved his beefy hands deeper into the pockets of his trousers, the scent of sawdust and raw meat clinging to them like a second skin. It was a particularly bleak November morning in Oldtown, a district clinging to the edge of the sprawling city of Kingshaven. Bart stood before the battered wooden door of "Higgins & Son - Finest Cuts," the brass plaque dull with age and grime. The faded gold lettering was barely visible under the persistent drizzle that seemed to perpetually plague the city.

The shop itself was nestled between a perpetually overflowing fishmonger and a cobbler whose hammers echoed rhythmically, a constant soundtrack to Bart's life. Inside, the air would be only marginally warmer, thick with the mingled aromas of spices, wood smoke from the back room's smoker, and the undeniably primal scent of fresh blood. It wasnâ€™t a pleasant perfume for the faint of heart, but to Bart, it was the smell of home, the smell of legacy, the smell of survival. He pulled the door open, bracing himself for the onslaught of chill air and the day's grim business.
