The fluorescent lights of Northwood High hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to another Tuesday morning that threatened to bleed into the rest of the week like watercolor on damp paper. Outside, the October wind whipped leaves across the cracked asphalt of the student parking lot, a visual representation of the chaos brewing inside. Ms. Evelyn Grace Hawthorne, known to most as "Ms. Hawthorne," but secretly "E.G." to herself when she needed a pep talk, stood at the head of her tenth-grade English classroom, a half-empty mug of lukewarm coffee clutched in her hand like a lifeline.

The classroom itself, Room 212, was a microcosm of Evelyn's personality: organized chaos. Books lined the shelves, some well-loved and dog-eared, others brand new and awaiting exploration. Posters of classic authors shared space with student artwork and motivational quotes, a carefully curated mix of intellectual stimulation and adolescent encouragement. A string of fairy lights, a remnant from a particularly inspired unit on Romantic poetry, twinkled softly in the corner, providing a touch of warmth against the institutional chill of the building. Today, however, even the lights seemed to struggle against the palpable tension that permeated the air, thicker than the stale pizza aroma lingering from Friday's debate club meeting. The bell was about to ring, and the first wave of students, armed with backpacks and apathy, were poised to flood into her sanctuary, ready or not. Evelyn took a deep breath, fortified by the dregs of her coffee, and prepared to face the day.
