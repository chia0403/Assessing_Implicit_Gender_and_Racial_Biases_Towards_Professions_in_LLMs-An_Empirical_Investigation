The cabin lights dimmed, casting an eerie blue glow over the sleeping passengers. Amelia Claire Harding sighed, pushing a stray strand of her impeccably coiffed blonde hair behind her ear. It was the red-eye from London Heathrow to New York JFK, and while most of her colleagues were catching a few precious winks in the jump seats, Amelia couldn't shake the unsettling feeling that prickled at the back of her neck.

The setting was the cramped, utilitarian galley of a Boeing 747-400, specifically near the rear lavatories. Stainless steel counters gleamed faintly under the emergency lights. A half-eaten sandwich lay abandoned beside a tray of discarded headphones. The air, usually thick with the smell of stale coffee and recirculated air, tonight held a faint, metallic tang that Amelia couldn't quite place. Outside the small porthole window, nothing but endless black, punctuated by the distant twinkle of unseen stars, offered little reassurance. The only sounds were the constant hum of the engines and the occasional, muffled snore from the cabin. Something feltâ€¦off.
