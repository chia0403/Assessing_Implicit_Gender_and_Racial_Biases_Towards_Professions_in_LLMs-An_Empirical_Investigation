## The Serpent's Kiss

**Setting:** The village of Aethelred's Hearth clung to the precipice of the Dragon's Teeth mountains like a stubborn limpet to a jagged rock. Wind, laced with the bite of perpetual snow, howled through the narrow, cobbled streets, whistling dirges around the sturdy, grey stone houses. The air, thin and cold, carried the scent of pine, woodsmoke, and the metallic tang of the iron ore that was the village's lifeblood - and its bane.

**Story Opening:**

Elara, a crow's feather caught in the perpetual wind, was the first to see it. A flicker of something unnatural against the already alien grey of the Dragon's Teeth. She shrieked, a thin, terrified sound that was quickly swallowed by the gale, but it was enough to draw the attention of **Bartholomew Silas Stonemason**, who was meticulously carving a gargoyle's wing outside his workshop. Bartholomew, a man weathered by years of relentless sun and biting wind into a stoic visage of deep lines and granite-hard muscle, straightened, his calloused hands still dusted with pale grey dust. He shielded his eyes, squinting against the blinding glare of the snow-dusted peaks. "What is it, Elara? A lost lamb again?" he asked, his voice a low rumble that barely carried over the wind.

Elara shook her head, her wide eyes reflecting the pale sky like polished obsidian. "No, Master Stonemason," she stammered, pointing a trembling finger towards a ridge high above the village. "Something…moved. Something…shining."

Bartholomew followed her gaze, his heart, usually as steady and unyielding as the stone he shaped, suddenly stuttered in his chest. He saw it now, a glint of gold, unnatural and impossibly bright, nestled between the jagged peaks like a serpent's kiss. Something told him, with a chilling certainty that seeped into his bones, that Aethelred's Hearth was about to experience more than just the usual hardship of winter.
