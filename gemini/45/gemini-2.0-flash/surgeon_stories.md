Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a surgeon named Dr. Evelyn Reed:

**Setting:** The relentless rhythm of a heart monitor echoed in the stark, sterile silence of Operating Room Three at St. Jude's Hospital in downtown Chicago. Outside, the early March wind howled off Lake Michigan, a metallic whine that seemed to seep through the triple-paned windows and into the very bones of the building. The air inside, however, was a carefully controlled 70 degrees, arid and devoid of comfort, designed to minimize the risk of infection. Bright, unforgiving surgical lamps blazed down on the open chest cavity before them, reflecting harshly off the array of gleaming instruments meticulously arranged on a draped table.

**Story Opening:**

Dr. Evelyn Reed, her brow furrowed in concentration, meticulously cauterized a small, bleeding vessel. Sweat beaded on her forehead beneath the surgical cap, catching the light and making her appear, for a fleeting moment, almost angelic. But there was nothing celestial about the grim intensity in her eyes. She hadn’t slept properly in 36 hours, fueled by lukewarm coffee and sheer willpower. Another late-night emergency, another life hanging precariously in the balance. She glanced at the anesthesiologist, Dr. Ramirez, who gave a barely perceptible nod. The patient's vitals were stable, for now.

"Suction," Evelyn commanded, her voice crisp and devoid of inflection. Her gloved hand moved with practiced ease, the precision born of years of relentless training and countless hours spent battling against the unforgiving nature of the human body.  Beneath her scalpel, she saw the subtle flicker, the tell-tale sign she’d been dreading – an arrhythmia. Damn it. This wasn't supposed to happen. She had followed protocol to the letter.
