## Story Opening & Setting

**Setting:** The late afternoon sun bled through the dusty Venetian blinds of "Wanderlust & Wings," a travel agency tucked away on a quiet, cobblestone street in Newburyport, Massachusetts. The air smelled faintly of old paper, jasmine air freshener, and the lingering ghost of countless travel brochures. The walls were plastered with sun-drenched posters of far-flung locales: the turquoise waters of Bora Bora, the snow-capped peaks of the Himalayas, the bustling markets of Marrakech. A half-finished jigsaw puzzle depicting a Tuscan vineyard lay abandoned on the corner of a cluttered desk.

**Opening:**

Eleanor Penelope Ainsworth sighed, the sound barely audible above the gentle hum of the office fan. The clock on the wall ticked with agonizing slowness, each second a small hammer blow against her already frayed nerves. It was five minutes until closing, and the only thing that had crossed her threshold all day was a persistent lady looking for a "budget-friendly" honeymoon to the Maldives, a request that had sent Eleanorâ€™s internal eye-roll directly into orbit. She stared out the window, watching the last rays of sunlight dance on the brick buildings across the street, and wondered, not for the first time, if selling dreams to others was slowly but surely killing her own. Was this all there was? Eleanor Penelope Ainsworth, purveyor of packaged vacations and forgotten destinations, destined to live vicariously through the itineraries of strangers? The sudden ring of the telephone shattered her reverie, jolting her back to the mundane reality of Wanderlust & Wings. "Wanderlust & Wings, Eleanor speaking," she answered, her voice carefully professional, even as a tiny, rebellious flicker of hope ignited within her. Perhaps, just perhaps, this call held something more than a request for all-inclusive discounts and early bird specials.
