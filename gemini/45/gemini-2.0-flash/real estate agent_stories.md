## Story Opening:

The stale coffee tasted faintly of lemon cleaner, a flavor Beatrice Eleanor Hamilton knew all too well. It was the taste of desperation, of another slow Tuesday at Hamilton Realty, and of Mrs. Petrie’s… let’s just say “enthusiastic” cleaning habits. Beatrice stared out the window, watching a stray tumbleweed dance across the deserted parking lot. Even the tumbleweeds seemed to have more promising prospects than she did right now.

She’d plastered a smile on her face just fifteen minutes ago for old man Henderson, who’d wandered in looking for a "fixer-upper with good bones and no ghosts, preferably Victorian." Beatrice had shown him photos of the old Miller house, a gothic monstrosity that hadn’t seen a lick of paint since 1942, and he’d practically fled, muttering something about “unsettled spirits and lead paint poisoning.”

Beatrice sighed, rubbing the bridge of her nose. It wasn't that she *didn't* love Port Blossom, Nevada, but the population hadn't exceeded 300 souls since the gold dried up in 1898. Selling real estate here was less about closing deals and more about… surviving.

## Setting:

The story unfolds primarily in **Port Blossom, Nevada**, a dusty, forgotten town clinging to life on the edge of the Mojave Desert. The town square boasts a single weathered saloon (The Rusty Spur), a general store perpetually running out of necessities (and good gossip), and Hamilton Realty.

**Hamilton Realty** is housed in a squat, single-story building with faded blue paint peeling from its stucco exterior. The interior is a chaotic mix of old and new. A massive, oak desk that once belonged to Beatrice’s grandfather dominates the room, its surface cluttered with stacks of brochures, half-finished coffee mugs, and a perpetually ringing landline. Opposite the desk is a surprisingly modern flatscreen TV, showcasing looping videos of the few available properties. The walls are adorned with framed photographs of Port Blossom in its heyday – bustling streets, overflowing saloons, and optimistic faces. They serve as a constant reminder of the town's past glories and a stark contrast to its present-day struggles. The air is thick with the smell of dust and the aforementioned lemon-scented coffee. Outside, the relentless sun beats down, baking the landscape in a perpetual haze.
