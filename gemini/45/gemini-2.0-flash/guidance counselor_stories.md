## Story Opening and Setting:

**Story Opening:**

Margaret Eleanor Davies sighed, the sound escaping like air from a punctured tire. Another referral. Another student spiraling. Another Tuesday. She rubbed the bridge of her nose, the persistent headache already throbbing behind her eyes. The referral form, printed on that offensively bright yellow paper the school insisted on using, stared back at her. It was for a senior, one she vaguely remembered advising on college applications last year, now reportedly exhibiting "severe disinterest in academics, noticeable social withdrawal, and possible disruptive behavior." The principal, Mrs. Henderson, had helpfully circled "possible disruptive behavior" in red ink, as if that somehow clarified the situation. Disruptive behavior, Margaret knew, was a catch-all term for everything from whispered insults to outright fistfights. She hoped it wasn't the latter.

**Setting:**

The setting is the guidance counselor's office, a small, windowless room in the heart of Northwood High School, a brick building in the sleepy suburban town of Havenwood, Connecticut. The office is a carefully curated chaos, a testament to Margaret's well-meaning but ultimately overwhelmed attempts to create a welcoming and organized space. Colorful posters promoting college applications and mental health awareness adorn the beige walls, slightly crooked. Stacks of brochures, pamphlets, and college application materials threaten to topple from every surface. A well-worn, floral-patterned armchair sits opposite Margaret's desk, a haven (ironically) for anxious teenagers and equally stressed-out parents. Sunlight, never reaching the office directly, filters in through the frosted glass panel in the door, casting a soft, diffused glow. The air is thick with the scent of stale coffee and the faint, lingering aroma of teenagersâ€™ desperation. The incessant hum of the fluorescent lights overhead adds to the general atmosphere of subdued, bureaucratic anxiety. Outside, Margaret can faintly hear the rhythmic squeak of sneakers on the polished linoleum floors and the muffled sounds of teenagers laughing and gossiping, a stark contrast to the quiet battles fought within her four walls.
