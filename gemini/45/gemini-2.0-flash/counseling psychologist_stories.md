## Story Opening:

The chipped mug warmed Dr. Eleanor Astrid Vance’s hands as she stared out the window at the relentless drizzle. Seattle had been weeping for weeks, mirroring the emotional downpour she’d been wading through with her clients. Today's first session was scheduled to start in precisely five minutes, and a familiar knot tightened in her stomach. It wasn't that she disliked her work; quite the opposite. She found immense satisfaction in helping people untangle the knots in their own lives. But some days, the weight of their pain felt almost suffocating.

The rhythmic thump of the streetcar rattling past her practice snapped her out of her reverie. She took a long sip of lukewarm chamomile tea, the herbal scent barely cutting through the lingering scent of last night’s burnt popcorn – a failed attempt at movie night with her niece, Lily, who was thankfully still fast asleep upstairs. She really needed to replace that microwave.

Just then, a persistent buzz from the intercom startled her. 

"Dr. Vance?" the slightly distorted voice crackled. "Mr. Silas Blackwood is here for his appointment."

Eleanor sighed, straightened her spine, and plastered on her most empathetic smile. Showtime.

## Setting:

Dr. Eleanor Astrid Vance’s counseling practice, "Beacon Counseling," was located on the second floor of a renovated brick building in the vibrant, slightly bohemian neighborhood of Fremont, Seattle. The building had once housed a shipping supply warehouse, and its exposed brick walls and high ceilings retained a touch of its industrial past. 

Eleanor had deliberately chosen the space for its charm and accessibility. The interior was designed to be warm and inviting, a stark contrast to the sterile environments often associated with medical practices. Soft, muted tones of blues and greens adorned the walls, complemented by carefully curated artwork featuring calming landscapes. A plush, overstuffed sofa dominated the waiting area, flanked by a small table laden with magazines and a bowl of complimentary mints.

Eleanor's office itself was a haven of tranquility. A large, comfortable armchair faced a small, round coffee table, perfect for holding tissues and fostering a sense of connection. A fiddle-leaf fig tree stood sentinel in the corner, its broad leaves a vibrant splash of green against the muted backdrop. Bookshelves lined one wall, overflowing with psychology texts, self-help guides, and the occasional well-loved novel. Sunlight, when it deigned to appear through the Seattle gloom, streamed through the large windows, casting a warm glow on the room.
