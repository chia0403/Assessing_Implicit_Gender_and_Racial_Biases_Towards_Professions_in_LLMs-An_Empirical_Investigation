Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a manicurist:

**Story Opening:**

The neon sign of "Polished Perfection" flickered valiantly against the encroaching twilight, spitting a sickly pink glow onto the rain-slicked sidewalk. Inside, Beatrice Anastasia Bellweather, breathed in the comforting aroma of acetone and possibility. Tonight, however, possibility felt thin, frayed at the edges like a neglected cuticle. Mrs. Higgins, her last client for the evening, was droning on about her poodle's supposed psychic abilities, and Beatrice found her attention drifting, as it often did when the late afternoon slump settled in. She chewed on the inside of her cheek, resisting the urge to tap her brightly painted nails against the countertop. Tap, tap, tap. A rhythm that mirrored the relentless churn of her mind. Tonight, the nails were a vibrant, almost aggressive, scarlet – "Dragon's Breath," the label declared – a stark contrast to the gentle ballet of her hands as she coaxed Mrs. Higgins's stubby fingers into a semblance of elegance. But the red felt like a warning signal, a visual representation of the humming energy that threatened to spill over the edge of her carefully constructed composure.

**Setting:**

The scene is set inside "Polished Perfection," a small, privately owned nail salon located in a slightly-faded commercial district of a mid-sized, Midwestern city called Oakhaven. The building itself is a narrow, brick structure sandwiched between a struggling antique store and a laundromat that always seems to be overflowing with suds.

The interior of Polished Perfection is a carefully curated oasis of calm, designed to evoke a sense of luxury on a shoestring budget. The walls are painted a soothing shade of lavender, accented with gold-framed prints of vintage nail art advertisements. Three manicure stations, each equipped with a comfortable chair and a custom-built, marble-topped table, line one wall. Another wall houses a dizzying array of nail polishes, organized by color and brand in a rainbow-like display. The front of the salon features a small waiting area with plush velvet chairs and a low table littered with outdated magazines.  A single, elaborate chandelier, rescued from a demolition sale and lovingly restored by Beatrice herself, casts a warm, flattering light over the space. Despite the salon's efforts towards elegance, there are small signs of wear and tear: a chipped tile near the entrance, a slightly faded area rug, and the ever-present faint scent of chemicals that clings to the air. The overall feeling is one of determined charm struggling against the relentless march of time and the realities of a small-town economy.
