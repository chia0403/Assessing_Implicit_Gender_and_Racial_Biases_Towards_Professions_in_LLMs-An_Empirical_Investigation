Okay, here's a story opening and setting:

**Setting:**

The air hung thick and sweet with the scent of lavender and perm solution inside "Shear Delights," a small, bustling salon nestled in the heart of Port Blossom, Maine. Sunlight streamed through the large bay window, illuminating the swirling dust motes dancing above the chipped linoleum floor. Vintage floral wallpaper peeled slightly at the seams, a testament to the salon's longevity – and the tight budget of its owner. The rhythmic snip of scissors and the hum of hair dryers created a comforting, familiar symphony, punctuated by the occasional bursts of laughter and gossip that flowed freely between stylists and clients.

**Opening:**

A bead of sweat trickled down Harriet Elizabeth Ainsworth’s temple, despite the salon's air conditioning laboring valiantly. She squinted at the reflection of Mrs. Petunia Buttercup in the large, antique mirror, her tongue peeking out between her teeth in concentration. Mrs. Buttercup, a woman whose love for floral prints rivaled only her dedication to bridge club, wanted "a little something to frame the face." A simple request, perhaps, but for Harriet, it felt like defusing a bomb. One wrong snip, one too-aggressive layering, and Mrs. Buttercup would unleash a torrent of complaints that could curdle milk.

Harriet carefully parted Mrs. Buttercup's shockingly bright pink hair, a color that clashed spectacularly with her floral dress, and took a deep breath. *Okay, Harriet, just like you practiced. Gentle. Even. Frame the face, but don't make her look like she's wearing a helmet.*

She raised her shears, the familiar weight comforting in her hand, and began to cut.
