## Story Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

The acrid smell of perm solution hung heavy in the air, a scent Beatrice "Bea" Eleanor Hawthorne had long since become immune to. Today, however, even Bea's seasoned nostrils twitched. Mrs. Higgins, bless her heart, had insisted on the "Spiral Goddess" perm from the brochure, claiming it would recapture her lost youth. Bea, privately, thought it looked more like a bewildered poodle had taken up residence on Mrs. Higgins' head. As she adjusted the rollers, a low hum vibrated through the floor, growing steadily louder. Bea paused, her brow furrowed. It wasn't the predictable rumble of a delivery truck, nor the clatter of the midday garbage collection. This was different. Deeper. Ominous. Outside, the chirping of sparrows abruptly ceased. Bea glanced at Mrs. Higgins, who remained oblivious, lost in a re-telling of her recent bunion surgery.

"Just a sec, Mrs. Higgins," Bea said, her voice slightly strained, "I think I hear something outside."

She wiped her hands on her pink smock and cautiously peered out the window, expecting perhaps a rogue street sweeper. What she saw, however, made the perm solution seem like the least of her worries.

**Setting:**

"The Curl Up and Dye," a small, independently owned salon in the heart of Willow Creek, Maine. It's a cozy, slightly outdated space with floral wallpaper, mismatched chairs rescued from various yard sales, and a perpetually-running fan that whirs like a contented cat. Sunlight streams through the large front window, illuminating the jars of colorful styling gel and the ever-present stack of dog-eared magazines. The air is a constant blend of hairspray, shampoo, and the lingering aroma of whatever Bea is brewing in the back for her homemade hair masks - usually a concoction involving honey, avocado, and the occasional questionable herb from her grandmother's garden. Outside, Willow Creek is a picturesque town, known for its lobster rolls, quaint antique shops, and a surprising number of tourists during the summer months. The harbor, usually bustling with activity, is strangely still today.
