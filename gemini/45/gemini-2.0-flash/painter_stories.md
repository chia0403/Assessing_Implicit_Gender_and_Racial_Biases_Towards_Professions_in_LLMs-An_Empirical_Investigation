The biting wind, laced with the acrid scent of salt and brine, whipped at Helena Beatrice Dubois’s exposed cheeks as she wrestled with her easel. The canvas, a sturdy, primed thing she'd splurged on at the art supply shop in town, threatened to become a sail and whisk her right off the craggy cliffs of Portreath. She planted her boots, clad in worn leather, more firmly in the damp earth, her gloved fingers tightening their grip on the wind-buffeted frame.

Portreath, Cornwall, in late October, was not for the faint of heart, nor the easily chilled. Most of the tourists had long gone, retreated to the warmth of their centrally-heated homes. But Helena found a raw, invigorating beauty in the tumultuous skies and the unforgiving sea. This was the true Cornwall, stripped bare of its summer finery, a place where the land and the ocean waged a constant, dramatic war. And that drama was precisely what she craved.

She’d rented a small, drafty cottage just outside the village for the winter. It was sparsely furnished, with a perpetually damp smell and a stubborn fireplace that coughed more smoke than heat. But it was hers, a sanctuary where she could lose herself in the rhythm of the waves, the cries of the gulls, and the endless, captivating dance of light on the water. It was here, on this windswept precipice, that Helena hoped to finally capture the essence of the storm, to translate the untamed energy onto canvas and, perhaps, to finally exorcise some of the demons that had haunted her own life.
