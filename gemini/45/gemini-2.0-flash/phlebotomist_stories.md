**Setting:** The stark, fluorescent-lit waiting room of the Northwood Clinic hummed with a nervous energy that Amelia Hayes, a seasoned phlebotomist, had grown accustomed to. Plastic chairs, bolted to the floor, were arranged in neat rows, occupied by a mix of fidgety children, elderly patients clutching worn newspapers, and weary-looking adults staring blankly ahead. A small, artificial ficus plant struggled for survival in the corner, its leaves coated in a thin layer of dust. The air smelled faintly of antiseptic and anxiety. The rhythmic beeping of a heart monitor from a nearby examination room punctuated the quiet murmurs and rustling paper. Outside, the relentless drizzle of an early November morning reflected the somber mood inside.

The rhythmic sigh of the automatic doors heralded the arrival of her next patient. She glanced at the electronic screen displaying the name: Mrs. Eleanor Vance. Amelia took a deep breath, the sterile air doing little to calm the knot that had formed in her stomach. Eleanor Vance. The name was a constant reminder of the line Amelia was constantly toeing, the ethical tightrope she walked every day. Mrs. Vance wasn’t just another patient; she was the mother of David Vance, Amelia’s ex-fiancé, the man who had shattered her heart three years ago.
