The humid Georgia air hung thick and heavy, clinging to everything like a second skin. A chorus of cicadas buzzed a relentless summer song, almost drowning out the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of Edgar Thistlewick’s hedge trimmers. He stood knee-deep in a vibrant sea of hibiscus and hydrangeas, the manicured lawns of the Oglethorpe Manor stretching out before him like a verdant carpet. Oglethorpe Manor, with its imposing columns, sprawling verandahs, and an air of faded grandeur, was Edgar's domain, his responsibility. It wasn't a glamorous life, being the groundskeeper of a crumbling antebellum estate, but it was a quiet one, and Edgar, in his fifty years, had come to appreciate the quiet above all else. He trimmed a stray rose bush, his brow furrowed in concentration, oblivious to the sweat trickling down his face. Today, the air felt heavier than usual, not just with humidity, but with a strange, almost palpable… expectancy.
