The insistent chirp of the telephone dragged Beatrice Abigail Butterworth from her daydreams of Tuscan sunshine and perfectly ripe peaches. Outside the twenty-third floor window of Butterworth & Sons, Steel Fabricators, a dreary London fog clung to the cityscape like a damp, unwanted shawl. The steel skeletons of unfinished skyscrapers poked through the gloom, a constant, grey reminder of the very unglamorous reality of Beatrice's life.

She sighed, reluctantly peeling her gaze away from the dismal view. "Butterworth & Sons, Beatrice speaking," she chirped, forcing an enthusiasm she didn't feel. The faint scent of burnt coffee lingered in the air, a testament to her earlier, failed attempt at a Monday morning pick-me-up. Her desk, a battleship-grey monolith inherited from a previous generation of Butterworth secretaries, was piled high with invoices, memos, and a half-eaten packet of biscuits. The linoleum floor, scuffed and worn from decades of relentless foot traffic, completed the picture of corporate monotony. It was a setting far removed from the sun-drenched hills of Italy that flickered in her imagination. This was Butterworth & Sons, and Beatrice Abigail Butterworth was, sadly, a very permanent fixture in its landscape.
