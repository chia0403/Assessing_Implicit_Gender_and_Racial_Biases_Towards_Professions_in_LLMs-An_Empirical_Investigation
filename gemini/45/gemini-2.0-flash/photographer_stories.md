## Story Opening & Setting:

**Opening:**

The scent of damp earth and decaying leaves hung heavy in the air, clinging to Elias Thorne like a shroud. He pressed his gloved hands deeper into the pockets of his worn Barbour jacket, the familiar weight of his Leica M6 a small comfort against the oppressive silence. A single bead of rain, having evaded the brim of his tweed cap, trickled down his temple. He ignored it, his gaze fixed on the crumbling mausoleum looming before him, a gothic silhouette against the bruised twilight sky. "Alright, old girl," he murmured to the camera, the whisper barely audible over the rustling wind, "let's see if you can still capture a ghost."

**Setting:**

The story is set in **Greywood Cemetery**, a sprawling, Victorian-era burial ground located just outside the small, forgotten town of **Havenwood, Maine**. Greywood is a place of overgrown paths, moss-covered headstones leaning precariously, and ancient oaks that claw at the sky. The air is perpetually damp and carries a scent of both death and ancient secrets. While officially still in operation, Greywood sees very few new burials. Instead, it exists as a forgotten relic, a melancholic testament to generations past. The season is late autumn, bordering on winter, and the landscape is painted in shades of grey, brown, and the occasional stubborn splash of crimson from dying leaves. The sky is perpetually overcast, lending the place a somber and haunting atmosphere.
