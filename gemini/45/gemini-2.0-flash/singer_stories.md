The spotlight wasn't just hot, it was predatory, sucking the air out of Isabella "Izzy" Russo's lungs and amplifying the tremor in her perfectly painted lips. She could feel the weight of five thousand expectant eyes, a sea of faces blurred in the dimness beyond the stage's edge, all waiting for her. Waiting for the voice that had, for the last five years, filled stadiums and topped charts. Waiting for the magic that had propelled her from a Brooklyn diner waitress to a global icon.

But tonight, the magic felt…broken.

The venue, the newly opened Stellaris Arena in Las Vegas, was a testament to excess. Gleaming chrome and swirling neon pulsed in rhythm with the thumping pre-show music that had finally faded into a hush. Towering screens displayed kaleidoscopic images of Izzy herself, her vibrant smile and cascading auburn hair larger than life, a stark contrast to the gnawing anxiety twisting in her gut.

The Stellaris was the crown jewel of Vegas's entertainment scene, a monument to ambition and celebrity, and Izzy, who'd dreamed of singing in dive bars, felt strangely out of place amidst its sterile grandeur. This wasn't the gritty, soulful energy she thrived on. This was…manufactured starlight. And tonight, that starlight felt like a suffocating shroud.
