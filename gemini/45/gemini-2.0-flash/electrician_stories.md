The salt spray stung Theodore Maxwell's face as he wrestled with the generator housing on the lighthouse balcony. The wind, a blustery banshee howling off the North Sea, threatened to rip the wrench right from his gloved hand. Below, the waves crashed against the jagged rocks that ringed Seabrook Island, a relentless rhythm that had both soothed and irritated Theodore for the past thirty years.

Seabrook Island Lighthouse was Theodore's kingdom, his responsibility. He was the sole electrician, the keeper of its electric heart, tasked with ensuring the steady, unwavering beam cut through the fog and guided ships safely past the treacherous coastline. The job was solitary, often monotonous, but Theodore found a certain peace in the solitude, a connection to the wild beauty that surrounded him.

He glanced out at the turbulent grey expanse. Another storm brewing, he guessed. And the lighthouse's primary generator had decided, as if on cue, to throw a temper tantrum. Theodore muttered under his breath, a string of colorful curses only the seagulls could understand. He tightened his grip on the wrench, the metal cold against his skin. Tonight, lives depended on him getting this damn thing running again.
