## Story Opening:

The air hung thick with the scent of petunias and damp earth, a smell Elias Thorne both loved and loathed. It clung to him, a fragrant shroud of his profession, seeping into his clothes, his hair, even his dreams. This morning, though, the usual comforting aroma felt heavy, almost cloying. He stood perched precariously on the edge of a newly laid flagstone patio, his worn leather gloves digging into the cool stone. The rising sun glinted off the dew-kissed lawn, painting the scene in idyllic hues of emerald and gold, but Elias remained unmoved.

He’d finished the job, his most ambitious to date, for Mrs. Van Derlyn, the notoriously demanding dowager of Oakwood Estates. It was a masterpiece, he had to admit, even to himself. An intricate tapestry of color and texture, a harmonious blend of manicured lawns and wild, rambling roses. But even as he admired his handiwork, a gnawing unease settled in his stomach. He felt a sense of…emptiness. Something was missing, something beyond the perfectly placed perennials and the precisely sculpted hedges. And he knew, with a sickening certainty, that it wasn't going to be found within the manicured borders of Mrs. Van Derlyn's prize-winning garden.

## Setting:

The story takes place in the fictional town of **Willow Creek, Connecticut**, nestled in the heart of Fairfield County. Willow Creek is a charming, affluent community characterized by sprawling estates, historical landmarks, and a strong sense of tradition. The town square boasts a quaint bookstore, a popular coffee shop, and a meticulously maintained gazebo that serves as the centerpiece for local events.

The economic backbone of Willow Creek is a mix of white-collar professionals who commute to nearby cities, and service-based businesses catering to the wealthy residents. **Elias Thorne's landscaping business, "Thorne & Bloom,"** is a well-respected fixture in the town, known for its quality craftsmanship and artistic flair.

The story opens in the meticulously landscaped backyard of **Mrs. Eleanor Van Derlyn's estate, "Oakwood Estates,"** on the outskirts of Willow Creek. The estate is a sprawling property boasting rolling lawns, ancient oak trees, and a stately Victorian mansion that overlooks the Long Island Sound. It's a symbol of old money and established wealth, a world far removed from Elias's own humble beginnings. The contrast between the ordered beauty of Oakwood Estates and Elias's own inner turmoil sets the stage for the unfolding narrative.
