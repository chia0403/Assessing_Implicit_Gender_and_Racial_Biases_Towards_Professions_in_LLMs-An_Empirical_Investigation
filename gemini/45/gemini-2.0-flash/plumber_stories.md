The wrench slipped, barking Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez's knuckles against the corroded pipe with a clang that echoed unnervingly in the cavernous, echoing space. She swore under her breath, a sound that mingled with the dripping, groaning complaint of the ancient plumbing. Amy hated this building. Absolutely, unequivocally *hated* it.

The setting was the basement of the Blackwood Manor, a crumbling behemoth of Victorian architecture perched precariously on a cliff overlooking the churning Atlantic. Salt spray licked at the grimy windows, blurring the already dismal view of the raging storm outside. The air was thick with the scent of mildew, damp earth, and something indefinably *wrong*. Exposed brick walls, stained with years of water damage, loomed close, punctuated by patches of peeling, faded wallpaper that hinted at a grandeur long since decayed. Rusted pipes, tangled like metallic vines, snaked across the ceiling, dripping sluggishly into puddles that reflected the single bare bulb swaying precariously overhead. The only other light came from Amy's headlamp, its beam cutting a hesitant swathe through the oppressive darkness, revealing dust motes dancing in the air like mischievous spirits. She was pretty sure she'd seen a rat the size of a small cat scurry across the floor earlier, but she was trying her best not to dwell on it. This plumbing job, fixing a burst pipe that had flooded the library (a library, might she add, filled with first editions that were probably worth more than her entire life), was definitely not worth the creeping feeling of unease that prickled at the back of her neck.
