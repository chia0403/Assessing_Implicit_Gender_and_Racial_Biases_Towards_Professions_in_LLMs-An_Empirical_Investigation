The fluorescent lights of the Piggly Wiggly hummed a monotonous tune, a tune Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne knew by heart. She could probably hum it in her sleep. Another day, another dollar, another avalanche of groceries sliding across her scanner. It was a Tuesday in late October, the air outside smelling of damp leaves and the faint promise of woodsmoke, but inside the Piggly Wiggly, it perpetually smelled of discounted coffee and slightly stale donuts. Amelia’s station, number four, was nestled between a towering display of Halloween candy – miniature Snickers threatening to topple – and a precarious pyramid of pumpkin spice-flavored everything. She wore her usual uniform: the faded green polo shirt emblazoned with the Piggly Wiggly logo, a name tag that read "Amelia H," and a weary smile plastered on her face, ready to greet the next wave of bargain-hunting shoppers.
