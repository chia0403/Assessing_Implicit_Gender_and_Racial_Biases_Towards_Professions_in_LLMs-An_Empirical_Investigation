## Story Opening:

The scent of old money and forced orchids hung thick in the air of The Grand Alexandria, a perfume Mortimer Finch had long grown immune to. He adjusted the epaulettes on his burgundy bellhop uniform, the threadbare gold braid digging slightly into his shoulder, and plastered on his most winning smile. A shiny, silver-haired woman with a poodle the size of a small sheepdog was approaching the revolving doors, her face pinched in a permanent expression of displeasure. Mortimer knew the type. Entitled. Demanding. And a guaranteed non-tipper.

He straightened, ready to offer his most deferential bow, but then a screech of brakes tore through the polished silence. A beat-up, robin’s-egg blue Ford Falcon, sporting more rust than paint, screeched to a halt directly in front of the hotel, practically kissing the manicured hedges. A plume of exhaust, smelling suspiciously of burnt rubber and something vaguely medicinal, billowed around it. Mortimer Finch’s smile faltered. This was definitely *not* the clientele The Grand Alexandria catered to. This was going to be interesting.

## Setting:

The story unfolds primarily within and around **The Grand Alexandria Hotel**, a landmark institution nestled in the heart of **Astoria, Oregon**. Imagine a grand, somewhat faded, Victorian-era building, overlooking the mouth of the Columbia River where it spills into the Pacific Ocean. The salty air mixes with the lingering aroma of pipe tobacco and vintage leather that permeates the hotel's cavernous lobby.

**Key Setting Details:**

*   **Exterior:** A imposing facade of weathered brick, embellished with ornate balconies and gargoyles. The manicured lawns surrounding the hotel are impeccably maintained, bordering on the theatrical. Overlooking the river, the hotel boasts a stunning, albeit slightly precarious, clifftop vista.

*   **Lobby:** A grand, echoing space dominated by a massive chandelier and a sprawling, Persian rug. Velvet ropes delineate the waiting areas, and gleaming brass accents punctuate the dark wood paneling. A concierge desk, manned by the perpetually bored Mr. Abernathy, stands sentinel near the entrance.

*   **Rooms:** Varying in size and luxury, the rooms range from the opulent presidential suite with panoramic river views to more modest, though still elegantly appointed, chambers on the lower floors. Each room boasts antique furniture, thick draperies, and a distinct air of faded grandeur.

*   **Other key locations:** The hotel's dimly lit, oak-paneled bar, "The Crow's Nest," known for its stiff drinks and hushed conversations. The bustling, and often chaotic, back-of-house area where the staff toil. And finally, the nearby docks and waterfront, a stark contrast to the hotel's refined atmosphere, teeming with fishermen, tourists, and a palpable sense of rugged, working-class life.
