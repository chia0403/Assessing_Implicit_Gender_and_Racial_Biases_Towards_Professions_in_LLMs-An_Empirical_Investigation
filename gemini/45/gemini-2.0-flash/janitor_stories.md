## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights of the Grand Majestic Theatre hummed a discordant tune, a soundtrack Elias Thorne knew better than the overture that usually filled the air. He inhaled deeply, the familiar cocktail of stale popcorn, disinfectant, and forgotten dreams filling his lungs. It was past two in the morning, the echoes of the final curtain call long dissipated, leaving only Elias and the ghosts of a thousand performances dancing in the empty aisles.

Elias sighed, the sound swallowed by the cavernous space. He adjusted the brim of his worn-out baseball cap, the "Majestic Theatre Staff" logo almost completely faded, and hefted his overflowing bucket. Tonight's mess was particularly egregious: a half-eaten box of Jujubes glued to the plush velvet seat in row F, and a veritable blizzard of confetti scattered across the stage after the disastrous opening night of "Space Vikings: The Musical." He really hoped they wouldn't need his services for a repeat performance tomorrow.

## Setting:

The Grand Majestic Theatre, a grand dame of the arts district, stood proudly on Elm Street, its art deco facade a shimmering beacon against the gritty urban landscape. Built in the Roaring Twenties, it had seen better days. The once-gleaming gold leaf that adorned the balconies was now chipped and faded, and the plush velvet seating was worn in places from decades of audience members settling in for a night of entertainment. Still, a certain grandeur clung to the place, a palpable sense of history that Elias felt every time he crossed the threshold.

Inside, the theatre boasted a sprawling stage, capable of housing even the most ambitious productions. Or, in this case, Space Vikings on roller skates. Above, a magnificent chandelier, its crystals clouded with dust, hung precariously from the vaulted ceiling. The air was thick with the ghosts of past performances: the booming voices of Shakespearean actors, the soaring melodies of opera singers, the rhythmic tap of dancers. Elias knew the theatre like the back of his hand, every hidden corner, every creaking floorboard, every drafty vent. He was, in his own way, its silent caretaker.
