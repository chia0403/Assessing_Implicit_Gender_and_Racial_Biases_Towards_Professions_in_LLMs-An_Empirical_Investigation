## Story Opening:

The scent of pine cleaner, battling valiantly against the lingering aroma of yesterday's pan-fried salmon, clung to the air like a persistent guest. Delia Mae Hawthorne sighed, pushing a stray strand of grey-streaked auburn hair behind her ear with the back of her latex-gloved hand. She hated cleaning the Maxwellâ€™s kitchen. It wasn't just the stubborn grease on the stovetop or the maddeningly mismatched Tupperware collection overflowing from the cupboards. It was the emptiness that permeated the space, a chilling silence that echoed the vast, untouched expanse of their sprawling Victorian mansion overlooking the Puget Sound. Today, however, there was a new kind of emptiness, a taut, unsettling quiet that crackled with unspoken tension, thick enough to coat her tongue. Usually, Mrs. Maxwell would be humming along to classical music, sipping Earl Grey, and discreetly observing Delia from the breakfast nook. Today, the nook was empty, the teacup untouched.

## Setting:

**Location:** Bainbridge Island, Washington State, USA. specifically, the Maxwell family's Victorian mansion, "Eagle's Point," perched dramatically on a cliff overlooking the Puget Sound.

**Time:** Mid-morning, a damp and overcast Tuesday in late October. The air is crisp with the smell of approaching winter and the ever-present tang of saltwater.

**Description:** The mansion itself is a three-story behemoth, painted a stately grey with white trim. Inside, it's filled with antique furniture, Persian rugs, and the kind of art Delia suspects cost more than her entire house back in Bremerton. Large windows offer breathtaking views of the Sound, but today they are obscured by a thick curtain of fog. The kitchen, where Delia is currently working, is large and well-equipped, though it feels somehow sterile, lacking the warmth of a truly lived-in space.
