Okay, here's a story opening and setting, with a main character named Arthur Penhaligon, a radio technician:

**Story Opening:**

The static crackled, a persistent hiss that Arthur Penhaligon had long ago learned to filter out, much like the incessant seagull cries that punctuated life on the Isle of Arran. Tonight, however, the static felt different. It wasn't the usual atmospheric noise or distant shipping chatter. This was… wrong. A frantic, oscillating buzz that prickled the hairs on the back of his neck. He adjusted the dial on his meticulously maintained Collins R-390A receiver, his brow furrowed in concentration. The needle danced erratically. "Now what in God's name...?" he muttered, leaning closer, the sickly-sweet smell of burnt Bakelite filling his small workshop. The hum intensified, morphing into a rhythmic pulse, almost… organic. Then, cutting through the chaos, a voice. Faint, distorted, and terrified, it whispered, "They're here..." before dissolving back into the static abyss.

**Setting:**

The story is set in the late autumn of 1967 on the Isle of Arran, a small island off the west coast of Scotland. Arthur's workshop is located in a converted stone barn attached to his small, windswept cottage overlooking the Firth of Clyde. The cottage itself is modest, furnished with practical, functional pieces.  The workshop, however, is Arthur's sanctuary. It's a chaotic but organized space filled with vintage radio equipment, oscilloscopes, soldering irons, and shelves overflowing with vacuum tubes and spare parts. Wires snake across the floor, and the air is perpetually thick with the scent of solder and ozone. The window overlooking the sea is perpetually salty and blurred by the spray from the fierce westerly winds, and the mournful cry of gulls is an ever present background noise. The island, while beautiful with its rugged hills and dramatic coastline, has a feeling of isolation and a palpable sense of the past, where whispers of old folklore and ancient standing stones are still heard, especially in the long winter nights.
