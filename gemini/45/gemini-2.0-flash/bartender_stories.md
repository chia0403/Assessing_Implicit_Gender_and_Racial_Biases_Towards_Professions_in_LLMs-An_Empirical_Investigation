## Story Opening:

The ice pick shattered, sending shards skittering across the sticky, bourbon-scented surface of the bar. Eleanor "Ellie" Hawthorne swore under her breath, the only sound competing with the mournful jazz saxophone weeping from the antique jukebox in the corner. She’d been meaning to replace the damn thing for weeks, but life at The Blue Moon Saloon had a funny way of swallowing up time and good intentions. Another broken pick, another forgotten chore.

Ellie sighed, wiping her brow with the back of her hand, leaving a faint smudge of cherry liqueur. It was close to midnight on a Tuesday, and the usual suspects had thinned out, leaving only a handful of regulars nursing their regrets and watered-down whiskeys. Rain hammered against the darkened windows, mirroring the relentless rhythm of her own thoughts. She was tired, bone-achingly tired, of the same old stories, the same old faces, the same old drinks. Tonight, more than any other, she longed for something different.

## Setting:

The Blue Moon Saloon was a relic, a faded jewel tucked away on a quiet side street in the historic French Quarter of New Orleans. It had been there for nearly a century, a testament to stubbornness and strong cocktails. The exterior was unassuming, a dark, peeling blue façade with a single, flickering neon crescent moon hanging above the entrance.

Inside, the atmosphere was thick with history and the ghosts of countless conversations. Deep red velvet booths lined the walls, their cushions worn smooth with age and the imprints of countless bottoms. Ornate, tarnished chandeliers cast a dim, amber glow across the room, highlighting the intricate woodwork of the bar, a solid mahogany behemoth that had witnessed everything from Prohibition speakeasies to rowdy Mardi Gras celebrations.

The air hung heavy with the scent of spilled liquor, stale cigarettes, and a hint of jasmine wafting in from the hidden courtyard at the back. Portraits of jazz legends, their faces captured in moments of fiery inspiration, adorned the walls, watching over the patrons like silent sentinels. The Blue Moon was more than just a bar; it was a sanctuary, a confession booth, and a place where the past whispered secrets to anyone who dared to listen. And Ellie, behind the bar, was its reluctant keeper.
