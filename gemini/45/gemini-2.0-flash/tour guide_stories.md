The humid Louisiana air, thick as gumbo, hung heavy around Elara Mireaux, clinging to her linen dress and slicking her dark curls to her forehead. She fanned herself with a hand-painted pamphlet featuring a ghostly image of Marie Laveau, but the gesture was more for show than actual relief. This was New Orleans in July, after all. Discomfort was part of the experience, like the beignets covered in powdered sugar that stuck to your fingers, or the slightly-too-strong cocktails that fueled the ghost stories she was about to tell.

Elara stood on the corner of Royal Street and St. Peter, the wrought-iron balconies of the Beauregard-Keyes Historic House casting intricate shadows on the sidewalk. Around her, tourists buzzed like agitated mosquitoes, a sea of sunburned faces, camera straps, and oversized "I Heart NOLA" t-shirts. She checked her watch, a tarnished silver pocket watch that had belonged to her grandmother. 7:58 PM. Almost time. The ghosts, or so they say, were always punctual.
