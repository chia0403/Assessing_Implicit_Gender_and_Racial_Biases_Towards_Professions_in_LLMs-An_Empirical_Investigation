The sun, a bruised plum hanging low on the horizon, bled across the Montana plains. Dust devils danced like mischievous spirits in the fading light, kicking up grit that stung Jedediah Silas Caldwell's already weathered face. He squinted, his calloused hand shielding his eyes as he leaned against the ancient, gnarled fence post. The post, like Jedediah himself, had seen better days. 

**Setting:** The Double C Ranch, nestled in the heart of Big Sky Country, Montana. It was a sprawling, unforgiving landscape of rolling hills, windswept grasses, and craggy rock formations. The main ranch house, a sturdy but faded clapboard structure, sat overlooking the valley, its porch sagged slightly with age and years of hard weather. A cluster of outbuildings - barn, stables, workshop - stood nearby, each bearing the marks of time and tireless work. The air, thick with the scent of sagebrush and cattle, hummed with the quiet intensity of the approaching night.
