## Story Opening:

The smell of diesel and stale coffee was practically a third nostril for Jedediah "Jed" McKinley, and this morning, it was particularly pungent. He scrubbed a hand over his sandpaper cheek, the stubble rasping against his palm, and squinted at the pre-dawn sky bleeding into shades of bruised purple and angry orange. Outside the chrome-rimmed window of his '79 Kenworth W900, nicknamed "The Beast," a lone tumbleweed pirouetted across the desolate landscape, a melancholic dancer in a dusty ballet. Jed sighed, the sound lost in the rumble of the idling engine. Another day, another load, another thousand miles between him and anything resembling a life.

## Setting:

The scene is a desolate truck stop on the edge of Barstow, California. The "Last Chance Gas & Grub" sign flickered weakly, its neon tubing struggling against the encroaching light. The asphalt parking lot was cracked and oil-stained, peppered with the hulks of other eighteen-wheelers slumbering before their drivers woke to their own endless journeys. Beyond the parking lot stretched the Mojave Desert, an unforgiving panorama of scrub brush, rocky outcrops, and the ever-present promise of scorching heat. The air, even at this early hour, hummed with a dry, dusty energy, promising another day where the sun would beat down with the ferocity of a forgotten god. The only other visible signs of life were a rusty water tower looming in the distance, etched against the sky like a skeletal finger, and a lone coyote slinking along the perimeter fence, its eyes glinting in the pre-dawn gloom. This was the edge of nowhere, and for Jed, it was just another stop on the long, winding road.
