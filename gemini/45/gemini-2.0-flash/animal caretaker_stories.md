The humid air hung thick and heavy, smelling of damp earth, slightly overripe mangoes, and the faint, musky scent of tiger.  For Imelda Rosario, Head Animal Caretaker at the sprawling, lush "Sunhaven Wildlife Sanctuary" nestled deep within the Costa Rican rainforest, it was the smell of home. The symphony of the rainforest, too, was familiar: the incessant chirping of cicadas, the guttural croaks of tree frogs, the occasional screech of a howler monkey echoing in the distance.  

Imelda, whose curly, salt-and-pepper hair was pulled back in a practical ponytail, squinted at the rising sun, its rays struggling to penetrate the dense canopy.  She adjusted the worn strap of her khaki utility vest, its pockets bulging with the tools of her trade: a small notebook, a well-worn multi-tool, and a handful of dried banana chips â€“ emergency rations, just in case.  Her day was already beginning, even before the first rays properly broke through the trees. Today's priority: a slightly grumpy Geoffroy's tamarin who seemed to have a particular distaste for his breakfast this morning.
