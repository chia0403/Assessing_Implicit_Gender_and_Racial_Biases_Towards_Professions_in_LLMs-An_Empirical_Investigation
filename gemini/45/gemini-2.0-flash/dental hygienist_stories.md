The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune, bouncing off the gleaming stainless steel of the instruments laid out on the tray. Tiffany Marie Dubois sighed, her breath fogging the small mirror she held in her gloved hand. 8:03 AM. Right on schedule. Mrs. Higgins, bless her soul, was never late.

The setting was the immaculate operatory #2 in Bright Smiles Dental, a family-run practice nestled in the charming, if slightly tourist-trap-prone, coastal town of Port Blossom, Maine. Port Blossom was all windswept cliffs, quaint lobster shacks, and an alarming abundance of antique stores. Bright Smiles, however, was a modern oasis, a testament to Dr. Millerâ€™s (Senior, now retired, and Junior, perpetually harried) dedication to providing state-of-the-art dental care. The walls were painted a soothing lavender, and a calming soundtrack of ocean sounds perpetually played, though Tiffany suspected it was more effective at lulling her than the patients. Outside, the salty air was crisp, carrying the faint scent of seaweed and diesel. Inside, it smelled resolutely of mint and the slightly medicinal tang of fluoride.

Tiffany Marie Dubois, a relative newcomer to Port Blossom, having moved from Boston just a year prior, had a love-hate relationship with the small town charm. She loved the peace, the slower pace, and the stunning scenery. She hated the lack of good takeout, the relentless curiosity of the locals, and the fact that her closest friend was now a two-hour drive away.

The buzz of the front door announcing a new arrival snapped her out of her thoughts. Right on cue. Mrs. Higgins, and with her, the start of another day navigating the intricate landscape of plaque, tartar, and occasionally, the surprising dramas hidden behind seemingly perfect smiles.
