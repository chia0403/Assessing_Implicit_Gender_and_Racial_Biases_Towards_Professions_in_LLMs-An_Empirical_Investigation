**Opening:**

The smell of lemon-scented cleaning spray and overzealous air freshener, a concoction that always made Eleanor Vance’s nose wrinkle, hung heavy in the air of the "Feel Good Fitness" studio. It was 5:45 AM, and outside, the sky was still a sullen charcoal grey, promising another relentless New England winter day. Inside, however, Eleanor was determined to manufacture sunshine. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, a constant hum that accompanied her practiced movements as she double-checked the weights, arranged the yoga mats in perfect rows, and cranked up the pre-programmed "Power Pop" playlist. Another day, another group of bleary-eyed, caffeine-fueled devotees ready to punish their bodies before the workday even began.

**Setting:**

Feel Good Fitness occupied the ground floor of a converted textile mill in the historic mill district of Lowell, Massachusetts. Exposed brick walls, remnants of the building's industrial past, were painted a cheery, optimistic shade of coral. Large windows, meant to bring in natural light, instead offered a panoramic view of the Merrimack River, its churning, icy water reflecting the grim morning sky. The main studio was spacious, dominated by a mirrored wall that stretched the length of the room. To the left, a smaller, more intimate studio was reserved for yoga and Pilates classes. A small reception area, manned by a perpetually cheerful student named Chad, separated the studios from the street entrance. Feel Good Fitness catered to a largely suburban clientele – overworked professionals, stay-at-home parents, and retirees seeking a bit of pep in their step. It was a place of aspiration, of sculpted bodies and guilt-free indulgence, a small island of perceived wellness in a town that still carried the weight of its blue-collar history.
