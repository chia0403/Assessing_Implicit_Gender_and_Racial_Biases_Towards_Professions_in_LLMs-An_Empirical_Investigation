The chipped ceramic mug warmed Amelia "Amy" Hayes' hands as she stared out the rain-streaked window. Outside, the perpetually grey skies of Astoria, Oregon, seemed to bleed into the churning waters of the Columbia River. The fishing boats, usually a vibrant tapestry against the drab landscape, were huddled in the harbor like frightened sheep, seeking refuge from the relentless downpour.

Amy took a long sip of her lukewarm coffee, the bitter taste barely registering. She was too distracted, too consumed by the swirling mess of information – or rather, the distinct lack thereof – surrounding the disappearance of Silas Blackwood, the eccentric owner of the Astoria Maritime Museum. He'd vanished three days ago, leaving behind only a cryptic note scrawled on a nautical chart and a town buzzing with speculation.

Amy, a reporter for the Astoria Astorian, had been assigned the story. It was supposed to be a fluff piece, a human-interest story to fill the Sunday edition. Instead, it felt like she was wading through treacle, chasing whispers and dead ends in a town that seemed determined to keep its secrets buried as deep as the shipwrecks that littered the riverbed.

The Astoria Astorian itself, a modest brick building nestled between a bakery and a souvenir shop on Commercial Street, was a far cry from the bustling newsrooms Amy had imagined during her journalism school days. Its linoleum floors creaked underfoot, the air smelled perpetually of old paper and stale coffee, and the clack of the ancient typewriters provided a rhythmic, almost hypnotic soundtrack to the day. But it was her chance, her chance to prove herself. And she wasn’t about to let Silas Blackwood disappear without a fight.
