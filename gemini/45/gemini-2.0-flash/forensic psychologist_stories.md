## Opening:

The air in the interview room was thick with stale coffee and suppressed anxieties. Dr. Eleanor Vance, Forensic Psychologist, adjusted her spectacles and leaned slightly forward, her gaze unwavering as it met the hollow eyes of the man across the table. He was a cipher, a meticulously constructed facade of normalcy, but Eleanor was trained to see the cracks. Cracks that whispered of the darkness within. He'd spoken for the last twenty minutes about his love of gardening, the meticulous pruning of his prize-winning roses, but Eleanor hadn't missed the subtle clenching of his jaw when he mentioned the thorns. Thorns, she knew, could be a symbol of pain, of control, of something far more sinister than simply a protective barrier around delicate petals. She took a slow, deliberate sip of her water, the quiet sound amplified in the small space, and broke the silence.

"Mr. Peterson," she said, her voice calm and measured, a stark contrast to the churning unease she felt simmering beneath her professional facade. "Tell me about the sound the shears made when you pruned your roses. Was it a crisp snip, or something… different?"

## Setting:

The interview room was located in the secure wing of the High Crest Psychiatric Hospital, a sprawling complex nestled on a wind-swept hill overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Built in the early 1900s, High Crest had a history as long and tangled as the overgrown cypress trees that lined its perimeter. Its architecture was a gothic revival nightmare: imposing stone walls, narrow arched windows, and a general atmosphere of oppressive grandeur that seemed designed to amplify the patients' sense of isolation. The secure wing, added in the 1980s, was a stark contrast – sterile and functional, all cold, hard surfaces and flickering fluorescent lights. The interview room itself was small and sparsely furnished: a metal table bolted to the floor, two uncomfortable chairs, and a one-way mirror that offered only a reflection of the room's bleakness. The only splash of color came from a small, framed print of a Monet water lily hung askew on the wall, a feeble attempt to humanize a space designed for containment and interrogation. The constant, low hum of the ventilation system was the room's ever-present soundtrack, a reminder that everything within these walls was controlled, monitored, and meticulously scrutinized. Outside, the crashing waves provided a constant, relentless pulse, a stark reminder of the untamed chaos that lay just beyond High Crest's imposing walls.
