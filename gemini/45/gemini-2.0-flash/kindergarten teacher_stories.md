The scent of stale glitter and dried Play-Doh hung in the air, a comforting aroma to Miss Beatrice Eleanor Plumtree. Sunrise filtered through the finger-painted windows of the "Rainbow Room" at Little Acorn Elementary, casting a mosaic of colors on the miniature chairs and tables. Beatrice, with her own perpetually-paint-flecked cardigan and a smile as bright as the construction paper sun glued to the bulletin board, surveyed her domain. It was 6:45 AM, an hour before the first rambunctious five-year-old would burst through the door, and Beatrice relished the quiet. This was her time, her sanctuary before the day's controlled chaos descended. She took a deep breath, the scent now laced with the familiar tang of lemon-scented disinfectant – a necessary evil after yesterday’s particularly enthusiastic encounter with finger paints and the tale of a "very real" unicorn that had apparently visited during naptime. Today, however, held a special kind of anticipation. Today was the day she introduced her students to the joys of… broccoli.
