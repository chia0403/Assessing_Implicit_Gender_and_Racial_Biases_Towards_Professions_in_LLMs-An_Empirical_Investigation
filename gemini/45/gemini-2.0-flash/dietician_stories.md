The scent of burnt kale chips hung heavy in the air, a culinary crime that made Dr. Eleanor Marguerite Ainsworth wrinkle her nose. It was the aromatic equivalent of a medical emergency, and as a registered dietician with fifteen years of experience battling the nutritional ignorance of the masses, Eleanor felt duty-bound to intervene. The offending smell emanated from the tiny kitchenette of "The Wellness Window," a newly opened holistic health center on the quaint but increasingly gentrified Elm Street in the heart of Willow Creek, Connecticut.

Willow Creek itself was a postcard come to life, a place where soccer moms drove gleaming SUVs and yoga studios sprouted like dandelions after a spring rain. The Wellness Window, unfortunately, was more aspirational than inspirational. With its hand-painted sign promising “Inner Harmony Through Holistic Healing” and a waiting room adorned with suspiciously dusty crystals, it reeked of well-intentioned but ill-informed dilettantism. Eleanor, hired for her expertise in actual, scientifically-backed nutrition, had a feeling she was going to be spending more time putting out culinary fires (both literal and metaphorical) than crafting individualized meal plans. Today, however, the fire was literal, and the smoke detector was starting to scream.
