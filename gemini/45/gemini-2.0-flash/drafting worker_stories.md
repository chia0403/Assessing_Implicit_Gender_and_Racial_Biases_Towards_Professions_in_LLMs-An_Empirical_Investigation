## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous drone above, a soundtrack to Arthur Penhaligon's Monday morning blues. He stared at the blank CAD screen, the cursor blinking mockingly. He'd been staring at it for a solid fifteen minutes, and all that had come to him was the insistent urge to chuck his half-eaten blueberry muffin across the office. Arthur suppressed the urge with a weary sigh and took another bite. Blueberry was supposed to be energizing, right? So far, all it was doing was staining his fingers an unsettling shade of violet.

He knew what he had to do. He *always* knew what he had to do. His boss, Mr. Abernathy, had assigned him the blueprints for the new sewage treatment plant down by the old docks. Three months he'd be spending knee-deep in wastewater plans, literally and figuratively. Arthur shuddered. He'd much rather be working on the new library downtown. Curves, light, open spaces… that was architecture. This… this was infrastructure. Necessary, of course, but about as inspiring as a leaky pipe.

He ran a hand through his already-dishevelled brown hair, leaving a faint blue smear on his forehead. Today was going to be a long one.

## Setting:

The story takes place in the bustling coastal city of **Port Blossom, Maine**, in the year 2042.

**Arthur Penhaligon's** workspace is a small, slightly cramped cubicle in the offices of **"Abernathy & Sons: Civil Engineering & Architecture,"** a family-run firm that's been a fixture in Port Blossom for over a century. The office building itself is a slightly outdated brick structure, a relic from a bygone era amidst the city's increasingly modern skyline. 

Inside, the cubicles are partitioned by fabric-covered walls, stained with coffee rings and covered in sticky notes filled with hastily scribbled reminders. The air smells faintly of stale coffee, printer toner, and the ever-present salty tang of the sea carried on the wind. 

Arthur's cubicle is a reflection of his own organized chaos. His desk is littered with blueprints, architectural digests, and various drafting tools. A half-finished Rubik's cube sits precariously on a stack of technical manuals. A small, potted succulent sits in a sunny spot by the monitor, a valiant attempt to bring some life to the sterile environment. The walls are adorned with faded posters of architectural marvels from around the world, a silent reminder of the grander designs Arthur dreams of creating one day.
