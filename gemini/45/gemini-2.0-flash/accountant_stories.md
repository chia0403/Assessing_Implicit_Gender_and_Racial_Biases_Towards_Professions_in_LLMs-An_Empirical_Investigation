The fluorescent lights of the office hummed a monotonous drone, a counterpoint to the silent hum of the adding machine beneath Elias Thorneâ€™s fingertips. Rain lashed against the tall, grime-streaked windows of the 27th floor of the Sterling & Finch building, mirroring the tempest brewing inside him. Elias, a senior accountant at the mid-sized firm of Blackwood, Billings & Croft, stared intently at the spreadsheet swimming before his eyes. The crimson ink bled across the page, highlighting the anomaly like a beacon of impending doom: a twenty-thousand dollar discrepancy in the Q3 report for Sterling Silver Solutions, one of their biggest clients.

The Sterling & Finch building, a brutalist monolith of steel and concrete, stood sentinel on the corner of Wall Street and Liberty. Inside, the firm occupied three floors, a labyrinth of cubicles, dimly lit hallways, and the oppressive weight of unspoken expectations. It was a place where dreams went to die a slow, paper-clipped death, and Elias Thorne had been a dedicated undertaker for the past twelve years. He had started with bright eyes and a naive belief in the power of numbers to reveal truth, but those eyes had dulled, and that belief had eroded under the constant pressure of deadlines, demanding partners, and the endless parade of questionable invoices.

Elias pushed his spectacles up his nose, the plastic frame digging into the bridge. The rain intensified, each drop a drumbeat against the glass, echoing the frantic thump of his own heart. Twenty thousand dollars. It wasn't a rounding error. It wasn't a misplaced decimal point. It was a black hole in the heart of a meticulously crafted financial statement, and Elias Thorne felt himself being sucked in.
