## Story Opening:

The incessant drumming of rain against the floor-to-ceiling windows was doing little to soothe Wallace Abernathy's frayed nerves. He’d been staring at the same flickering green and red numbers on his six monitors for the past four hours, each tick and dip a tiny hammer blow against his sanity. The Dow had opened down 300 points and was showing no signs of recovery. Today felt like the day the dam finally broke.

Wallace swallowed, the metallic tang of antacids a familiar taste on his tongue. He loosened his tie, the silk constricting him more than usual. Just yesterday, he'd been congratulating himself on navigating the turbulent waters of the market, feeling almost invincible. Now, the ground beneath his feet felt like it was crumbling into dust. He just needed one win, one solid play, to pull himself, and his clients, back from the brink. One…

He reached for the phone, his hand hovering over the receiver. Maybe a call to old man Henderson, see if he had any whispers from his golf buddies. He needed something, anything, before the screaming started.

## Setting:

Wallace Abernathy’s office occupied the entire 47th floor of the "Apex Tower" in downtown Chicago. From this vantage point, the city sprawled out beneath him, a grid of steel and glass that usually inspired a feeling of power and control. Today, however, the cityscape felt mocking, reflecting the storm raging within the market and within himself.

The office itself was a monument to success, albeit a slightly dated one. Dark mahogany paneling lined the walls, adorned with framed certificates and a portrait of a younger, more confident Wallace, sporting a thick head of hair. A plush, leather chesterfield sofa sat in a corner, facing a massive television screen that was perpetually tuned to CNBC. His large oak desk was cluttered with paperwork, sticky notes filled with indecipherable scribbles, and a half-eaten box of artisanal donuts – his pathetic attempt at comfort food. The air, usually crisp with the scent of expensive cologne and ambition, was thick with anxiety and the faint, persistent aroma of burnt coffee. The rain lashed against the windows, creating a constant, unnerving hum that amplified the silence in the room, broken only by the occasional, desperate ring of a phone in the distance. He was alone, exposed, and increasingly, terrified.
