## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The oppressive August heat clung to the asphalt of Redemption, Arizona like a hungry leech. Dust devils danced between the rusted carcasses of forgotten vehicles in Hank's Salvage & Parts across the street, a stark contrast to the meticulously organized chaos of Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez's garage, "Amy's Fix-It Fast."

**Story Opening:**

The stench of burnt oil and regret hung heavy in the air. Amelia Rodriguez, her brow slick with sweat beneath a grease-stained bandana, wrestled with a stubborn lug nut on a beat-up Ford pickup. "Come on, you son of a..." she muttered, gritting her teeth and tightening her grip on the wrench. The metal finally yielded with a groan, sending a satisfying jolt through her arms. Victory, however small, was a balm to the simmering frustration bubbling inside her. Business had been slow. Brutally slow. Redemption wasn't exactly booming, and most folks were either too broke to fix their rides or just plain content to let them rust into the desert landscape.

Amelia straightened, her back cracking in protest, and wiped her hands on a rag hanging from her back pocket. The midday sun blazed through the open garage doors, highlighting the well-worn tools hanging neatly on the wall, the half-disassembled engines resting on stands, and the meticulously labeled parts bins. It was her sanctuary, this garage. A place where she could drown out the whispers of the town, the whispers that always seemed to end with a question: "When are you gonna leave, Amy? Like your daddy did?" The question hung in the air, thick and suffocating as the Arizona heat, and Amelia Rodriguez tightened her grip on the wrench, determined to prove them all wrong. She wasn't going anywhere. Not yet.
