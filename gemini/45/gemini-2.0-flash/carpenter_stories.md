The smell of sawdust and linseed oil clung to Arthur Penhaligon like a second skin. It was a smell that permeated his very being, a comfort in the face of the harsh Cornish wind that perpetually buffeted his small workshop. He squinted, pushing a stray lock of grey-flecked hair from his brow, and surveyed the progress on the latest commission: a sturdy oak chest destined for the vicar's study. Sunlight, filtered through the grime-streaked panes of the workshop window, illuminated the intricate carving he'd painstakingly added - a stylized depiction of the waves crashing against the ragged cliffs of Land's End, a homage to the unforgiving beauty that surrounded Port Isaac.

His workshop, a converted stable at the back of his rambling stone cottage, was a chaotic symphony of tools and timber. Planes lay scattered amongst half-finished projects, their gleaming brass noses catching the light. Saws hung from hooks like metallic bats, ready to be roused to action. Stacks of seasoned oak, elm, and ash leaned against the damp stone walls, each plank carrying the story of its past life – the years spent weathering storms and absorbing the Cornish sun.

Outside, the salty tang of the Atlantic was sharp in the air, a constant reminder of the sea that both sustained and threatened the village. The cries of gulls mingled with the rhythmic thrum of fishing boats heading out to sea, a familiar soundtrack to Arthur’s solitary existence. He lived a simple life, a life dedicated to his craft, but a life tinged with a loneliness that mirrored the vast, unforgiving ocean stretching out before him. Today, however, the loneliness felt heavier than usual, a dull ache in his chest that no amount of sawdust could quite cover.
