Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a registered nurse:

**Setting:** The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune in the observation room of the Willow Creek Psychiatric Hospital. The walls, painted a calming, yet ultimately sterile, shade of pale green, were scarred with the faint impressions of countless leaning shoulders. Outside, a relentless February wind rattled the windowpanes, a sound that mirrored the unease simmering just below the surface of the room. Empty coffee cups dotted the scarred Formica table, remnants of a long, weary night.

**Opening:**

Dr. Albright cleared his throat, the sound a rusty hinge turning in the tense silence. "So, Ms. Ramirez, how do you feel about Mr. Davies's progress?"

Gabriella Lucia Ramirez, RN, adjusted the crisp collar of her navy blue scrubs and met his gaze, her expression carefully neutral. She'd been working the night shift for five years at Willow Creek and had learned to compartmentalize, to build a wall between her empathy and the raw, often heartbreaking realities she faced. But tonight, the wall felt particularly thin.

"He's been compliant with his medication, Dr. Albright," she said, her voice calm and professional. "He's attending group therapy sessions, and there have been no further incidents of aggression. However," she hesitated, tapping a pen against the edge of her chart, "he still isolates himself. He spends hours staring out the window. And he refuses to talk aboutâ€¦ the incident."
