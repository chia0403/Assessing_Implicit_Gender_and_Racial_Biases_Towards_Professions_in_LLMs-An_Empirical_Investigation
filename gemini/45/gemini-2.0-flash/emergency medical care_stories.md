Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a story with a main character who is an emergency medical care professional:

**Story Opening:**

The metallic tang of blood was thick in the night air, a rusty counterpoint to the sickly sweet smell of burning rubber.  Amelia Rose Hawthorne crouched low, her headlamp cutting a sharp white swathe through the chaos.  Rain, a relentless, bone-chilling drizzle, plastered strands of her auburn hair to her face, obscuring her vision just enough to be infuriating. "Pulse is weak but thready," she called out, her voice tight with urgency. "BP's dropping. We need to get him stabilized and prepped for transport. Now!" The screech of sirens grew louder, promising backup, but Amelia knew those precious seconds felt like an eternity when someone's life hung in the balance. She ripped open the patient's shirt, revealing a ghastly laceration across his chest, the kind that made even the most seasoned EMT question their career choices.

**Setting:**

The story opens on a winding stretch of Highway 17, about fifteen miles north of Santa Cruz, California. The road, notoriously treacherous with its blind curves and hairpin turns, snakes along the heavily wooded Santa Cruz Mountains. It's a late October night, the kind where fog clings to the redwoods like a ghostly shroud, and the air smells of damp earth and decaying leaves. The scene is the aftermath of a multi-vehicle collision. Two cars, one a mangled sedan and the other a pickup truck, are wedged against the guardrail. Debris is scattered everywhere â€“ shattered glass, twisted metal, and personal belongings thrown from the vehicles. The blinking lights of emergency vehicles paint the scene in an eerie, pulsating strobe, adding to the sense of urgency and dread.
