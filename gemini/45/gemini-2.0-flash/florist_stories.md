The scent of damp earth and bruised petals clung to Eleanor "Ellie" Rosewood like a second skin. Outside, the February drizzle plastered itself to the frosted windows of "Rosewood & Rue," her little flower shop nestled on a cobbled side street in the heart of Whitestone, Massachusetts. Whitestone, a town that prided itself on its meticulously preserved history and a suffocating sense of normalcy, was the perfect place for Ellie to hide, though whether she was hiding from something or someone, even she wasn't entirely sure anymore. Inside, however, was a riot of colour: the vibrant clash of crimson roses against the muted blues of hydrangeas, the sunny yellow of daffodils peeking out from amongst the elegant calla lilies. Ellie, perched precariously on a rickety stool, snipped thorny stems with practiced ease, her brow furrowed in concentration. A half-finished arrangement, destined for the Whitestone Community Church's annual "Welcome Spring" luncheon, lay before her, a hopeful beacon against the dreary winter afternoon.
