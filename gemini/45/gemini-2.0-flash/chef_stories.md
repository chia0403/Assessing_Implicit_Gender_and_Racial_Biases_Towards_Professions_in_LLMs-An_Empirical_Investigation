The copper pans hung gleaming above Jean-Luc Dubois' head, reflecting the soft morning light that streamed through the large, arched window of his kitchen. He hated mornings, especially Saturday mornings, the traditional market day in the small, medieval town of Aigues-Mortes. The air, thick with the briny tang of the nearby salt marshes, would soon be overtaken by the cacophony of vendors hawking their wares, the bleating of goats, and the high-pitched chatter of tourists. Jean-Luc, however, was determined to remain oblivious, barricaded within the comforting, organized chaos of his beloved restaurant, "Le Goût de la Mer." 

Le Goût de la Mer, a small, intimate bistro nestled within the ancient ramparts of Aigues-Mortes, was Jean-Luc's sanctuary, his canvas, his reason for breathing. The exposed stone walls, adorned with vintage posters advertising long-forgotten aperitifs, hummed with a quiet history. The checkered tablecloths, though impeccably laundered, bore the faint ghosts of countless meals, laughter, and shared secrets. Outside, the vibrant Provençal world churned, but inside, Jean-Luc could control, he could create, he could offer a brief, exquisite escape from the ordinary. And right now, he needed that escape more than ever.
