The fluorescent lights of the OmniCorp server room hummed a discordant tune, a soundtrack to the existential dread consuming Evelyn Grace Hawthorne. Evelyn, officially a Senior Systems Analyst at OmniCorp and unofficially the fire extinguisher of the IT department, stared at the blinking cursor on her monitor. It mocked her, a tiny, pixelated metronome counting down to what she suspected would be a very unpleasant Monday morning.

The server room itself was a sterile, windowless box in the heart of downtown Chicago. Racks of gleaming servers, each a silent powerhouse of data, lined the walls, their cooling fans a constant, low roar that both soothed and irritated Evelyn. The air conditioning blasted arctic cold, a necessity to keep the sensitive equipment from overheating, but a constant battle for Evelyn, who preferred a more temperate climate and perpetually sported a woolen shawl around her shoulders, even in July. Control panels flashed cryptic messages, and the ethernet cables snaked across the floor like metallic vines, a chaotic ecosystem of information. This was her domain, the digital underbelly of a multi-billion dollar corporation, and tonight, it felt more like a prison.
