The high-pitched whine of the drill was Dr. Eleanor Frances Albright's constant companion, a shrill symphony she'd learned to filter out, much like the low hum of the city outside. But today, even her seasoned ability to compartmentalize was failing her. The drill screeched a little too long, a little too loudly, bouncing off the sterile white walls of Examination Room 2.

Her brow furrowed beneath the protective plastic visor. Across from her, Mr. Henderson, a retired accountant with a perpetual look of mild bewilderment etched on his face, flinched. "Almost done, Mr. Henderson," Eleanor chirped, her voice a practiced blend of reassurance and forced cheerfulness. "Just polishing up that molar."

Eleanor's dental practice, "Albright Family Dentistry," occupied the second floor of a brownstone building on bustling Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village, New York City. Sunlight, usually a welcome guest, streamed through the large, arched window, highlighting the dust motes dancing in the air and, perhaps a little too dramatically, the flecks of amalgam she was meticulously extracting.

The room was a study in clinical efficiency, softened by Eleanor's attempts to make it feel less intimidating. A framed print of Matisse's "Goldfish" hung on the wall, and a small philodendron trailed languidly from a hanging pot. But the scent of antiseptic and the glint of chrome instruments still dominated, a constant reminder of the sometimes-unpleasant task at hand.

Outside, the city pulsed with life. The rumble of garbage trucks, the distant wail of a siren, and the cacophony of car horns all filtered in, a vibrant contrast to the quiet, controlled chaos of Eleanor's dental practice. She took a deep breath, the sterile air doing little to calm her frayed nerves. Today, the high-pitched whine wasn't just the sound of her job; it was a direct reflection of the anxiety gnawing at her insides. Something was definitely wrong. And it wasn't just Mr. Henderson's molar.
