Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a concierge named Alistair Finch:

**Setting:**

The Hotel Lumina Grand in the city of Atheria. Atheria is a sprawling metropolis known for its fusion of old-world charm and cutting-edge technology. Think cobblestone streets winding between towering skyscrapers, holographic advertisements flickering above horse-drawn carriages, and whispered deals brokered in both gilded drawing rooms and neon-lit arcades. The Lumina Grand itself is an institution, a landmark as iconic as the city's Clockwork Cathedral. Its opulent lobby, bathed in soft, ambient lighting, features a mosaic floor depicting the city’s history, towering floral arrangements that change daily based on the lunar cycle, and the faint, ever-present hum of the hotel’s advanced climate control system.

**Opening:**

Alistair Finch, impeccably dressed in the Lumina Grand’s bespoke charcoal-grey uniform, smoothed an imaginary wrinkle from his lapel. The air, scented with orchids and a subtle undertone of polished brass, did little to calm the butterflies fluttering in his stomach. It wasn’t the arrival of another demanding billionaire, or the frantic rush of a wedding party descending upon the lobby. No, this was different. He'd received the coded message from the hotel's archaic pneumatic tube system just an hour ago: "Silver Serpent, Room 713. Midnight Meeting Required."

Alistair had been the Lumina Grand's Head Concierge for fifteen years, privy to secrets and scandals that would make headlines across the world. But “Silver Serpent” was a name whispered only in the deepest, most discreet corners of the service staff. It signified a connection, a legacy tied to the hotel’s shadowy past, and a favour that could change everything. He glanced at the grand clock above the reception desk. 11:57 PM. Three minutes until he had to become someone entirely different, a role he hadn't played in years. He adjusted his tie, the metallic sheen reflecting the dim light, and hoped he still remembered the passphrase. Some things, even after all this time, were best left forgotten.
