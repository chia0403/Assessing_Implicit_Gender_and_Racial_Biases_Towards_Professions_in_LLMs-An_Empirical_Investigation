Okay, here's a story opening and setting:

**Story Opening:**

The scent of sandalwood and chamomile hung thick in the air, a comforting balm against the incessant drizzle drumming against the large, frosted windows. Seraphina Aurora Bellweather kneaded the taut muscle between her client’s shoulder blades, her thumbs moving with practiced ease. Usually, the rhythmic pressure and the soothing ambiance were enough to lull even the most stressed-out executive into a near-comatose state. But not Mr. Abernathy. He was a tightly wound spring today, even more than usual.

“Trouble at the office again, Mr. Abernathy?” Seraphina asked, her voice a low, melodic hum designed to further relax him.

He grunted, a sound more like a trapped animal than a man seeking solace. "Trouble doesn't begin to cover it, Seraphina. We're talking… existential threat.”

Seraphina suppressed a sigh. She wasn’t paid for corporate therapy, but she was a good listener. And sometimes, a good listener was all a person really needed, even if it meant a significantly smaller tip.

**Setting:**

Seraphina's massage studio, "Aurora Wellness," is located in a refurbished Victorian building on a quiet, tree-lined street in the upscale neighborhood of Beacon Hill, Boston. The exterior is painted a soothing sage green, with a small, tasteful sign above the door adorned with a stylized aurora borealis. Inside, the studio is a haven of tranquility. Natural light filters through frosted windows, casting a soft glow on the pale lavender walls. Two massage rooms, each meticulously decorated with comfortable linens, aromatherapy diffusers, and carefully curated artwork featuring calming nature scenes, branch off from a small, welcoming reception area. Soft, instrumental music plays continuously, and the air is always subtly infused with the scent of essential oils. The reception area also includes a small display of organic teas and locally made skincare products, carefully selected by Seraphina for their therapeutic properties. The overall aesthetic is one of understated luxury and profound relaxation, a world away from the bustling city just outside its doors.
