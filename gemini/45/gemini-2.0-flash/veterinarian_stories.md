## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The biting wind whipped off the choppy waters of the Salish Sea, carrying the scent of salt and diesel. Port Townsend, Washington, nestled against the Olympic Peninsula, was shrouded in a thick, clinging fog. Rain hammered against the corrugated metal roof of the Port Townsend Marine Science Center, a small but dedicated research facility that housed a rescue and rehabilitation program for marine mammals.

**Opening:**

Dr. Evelyn Magnolia Reed slammed the heavy door of her battered, seafoam-green Subaru shut, the sound swallowed by the roaring wind. She pulled her waterproof hood tighter, tucking a stray strand of auburn hair back under its protective embrace. The salty air stung her cheeks, already flushed from battling the elements. It was days like this, days where the world felt grey and unforgiving, that she questioned her life choices. Leaving the bustling city of Seattle for this small, isolated haven seemed like a good idea on paper, a return to her childhood love of the ocean and its creatures. But now, as she trudged towards the Marine Science Center's main building, the isolation felt less like peaceful solitude and more like a gnawing emptiness.

A shrill whistle pierced the gloom, followed by a frantic shout. "Evelyn! Evelyn, we need you! Now!"

Evelyn's shoulders straightened. Doubts and self-pity vanished, replaced by the familiar surge of adrenaline. Someone needed her. Something was wrong. She broke into a run, the grey landscape blurring into a watercolor of urgency. It was time to be Dr. Evelyn Magnolia Reed, the veterinarian of the Salish Sea, and right now, that was all that mattered.
