## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights of "TaxTime Solutions" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the slow, agonizing march of April 14th. Beatrice Eleanor Plum, a woman whose life revolved around the minutiae of W-2s and the tantalizing possibilities of itemized deductions, slumped back in her ergonomic chair. Her eyes, usually sharp and focused on the intricacies of Form 1040 schedules, were bleary. It was 8:47 PM, and she could practically taste the freedom of the next twenty-four hours, a freedom she planned to spend draped across her floral sofa, mainlining episodes of "Antiques Roadshow" and ignoring the shrill ring of her landline.

Another client, Mr. Henderson from down the street, had just left, convinced Beatrice had squeezed every possible penny from the cruel clutches of Uncle Sam. He’d even left a small, suspiciously sticky box of donuts as a thank you. Beatrice eyed it warily. Free donuts from Mr. Henderson always meant sprinkles and a thick, artificial glaze.

Just as she reached for the box, contemplating the existential dread of another bite of saccharine despair, her phone buzzed. Not the landline, mercifully, but her personal cell. Reluctantly, she picked it up.

The caller ID read: UNKNOWN NUMBER.

Beatrice groaned inwardly. Another last-minute straggler, panicking about filing an extension. "Just what I needed," she muttered, pressing the answer button. "Beatrice Plum speaking, how can I help…?"

## Setting:

The year is 2023. The primary setting is "TaxTime Solutions," a small, independent income tax preparation office located in the unassuming, somewhat faded strip mall of Elmwood Village, in the fictional town of Harmony Creek, Pennsylvania. Harmony Creek is the kind of place where everyone knows everyone, their business is everyone else's, and the biggest excitement of the week is Bingo night at the VFW hall.

TaxTime Solutions is a reflection of Harmony Creek itself – practical, reliable, and a little bit dated. The walls are painted a calming (but undeniably beige) shade of "Oatmeal Harmony." Three desks, each piled high with tax documents and overflowing with pens, line the main room. A small, slightly dusty ficus plant sits in the corner, a silent witness to countless financial anxieties. The air is thick with the smell of cheap coffee and the faint, metallic tang of toner from the perpetually overworked printer. The waiting area is furnished with a chipped Formica table and a stack of well-worn magazines featuring celebrity weight-loss tips and local community events. A framed picture of Beatrice, beaming awkwardly next to a giant, inflatable dollar sign, hangs precariously above her desk, a testament to a slightly ill-advised marketing campaign from five years prior. It's not glamorous, but it's home to Beatrice, and for one month out of the year, it's the epicenter of financial peace of mind for the residents of Harmony Creek.
