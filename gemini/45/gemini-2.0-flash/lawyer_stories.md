The incessant drip, drip, drip of the leaky faucet in her kitchenette was mocking Penelope Ainsworth. It was a rhythm of slow, agonizing torture that mirrored the case currently consuming her life: the egregious overcharging of elderly residents at the Whispering Pines Assisted Living Facility.

Penelope, her dark curls escaping the messy bun atop her head, stared blearily at the overflowing inbox on her laptop screen. The screen’s pale light illuminated the cramped confines of her downtown Seattle office, a space crammed with overflowing bookshelves, precariously stacked legal documents, and half-empty coffee cups. The building itself was a testament to bygone grit – the brick exterior stained with decades of rain, the interior smelling faintly of mothballs and regret. From her window, she could see a sliver of Puget Sound, the ferry lights blinking in the distance like taunting beacons of escape.

Outside, the city hummed with the energy of a Friday night. Inside, however, Penelope was drowning in depositions, medical records, and financial statements, each page screaming of exploitation and broken trust. She rubbed her tired eyes, the grit of exhaustion settling beneath her lids. This was her life, a tireless crusade against injustice, often fought in dimly lit offices and fueled by lukewarm coffee. And right now, with the incessant drip of that leaky faucet, it felt utterly, hopelessly overwhelming.
