The clatter of the keyboard was a pale imitation of the storm raging outside. Wind howled like a banshee, rattling the ancient windows of the lighthouse and driving sheets of rain against the thick glass. Inside, huddled under a threadbare afghan, sat Amelia Eleanor Thorne, writer of gothic romances and resident eccentric of the tiny, windswept island of Oakhaven.

The lighthouse, her home for the past five years, stood sentinel at the edge of the island, a solitary white tower against the bruised purple sky. It was a relic, decommissioned years ago and purchased for a song. Amelia, drawn to its isolation and the dramatic landscape, had found both sanctuary and inspiration within its sturdy, salt-encrusted walls.

The lower level was a chaotic jumble of books, maps, and half-finished manuscripts. A wood-burning stove struggled valiantly against the encroaching dampness, casting flickering shadows that danced across the walls. The spiral staircase, worn smooth by countless turns, led up to the old lantern room, now Amelia's writing space. From its panoramic windows, she could see the turbulent sea stretching to the horizon, a constant reminder of the power and mystery that fueled her imagination.
