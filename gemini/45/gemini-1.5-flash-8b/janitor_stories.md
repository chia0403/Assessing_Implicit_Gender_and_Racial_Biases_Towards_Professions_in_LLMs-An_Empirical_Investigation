The flickering fluorescent lights of the Grand Zenith Library hummed a mournful symphony, a counterpoint to the rustle of paper and the hushed whispers of unseen readers.  Dust motes danced in the pale beams, illuminated by the solitary figure of  Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, the night janitor.  He wore his familiar, slightly stained, navy blue uniform, the faded logo of the library barely discernible on the breast pocket.  Tonight, the library was eerily quiet, a stark contrast to the usual murmur of activity.  Only the rhythmic thump of Barty's mopping bucket against the polished floor broke the silence, a comforting metronome in the otherwise empty space.

The year was 2042.  The Grand Zenith Library, nestled in the heart of Neo-Kyoto, was more than just a repository of knowledge; it was a living testament to a bygone era, a haven of whispers and forgotten stories.  Towering bookshelves, reaching towards the cathedral-like ceiling, were packed with volumes on everything from astrophysics to ancient Japanese calligraphy.  A network of interwoven hallways, each with its own unique scent and atmosphere, led readers through meticulously curated collections, from the hushed intimacy of the poetry section to the more vibrant, buzzing energy of the science fiction area.  But tonight, the only sounds were the subtle creaks of aged wood and the gentle sigh of the air conditioning.
