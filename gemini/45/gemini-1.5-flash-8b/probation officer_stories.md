Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the probation office, mirroring the storm brewing inside Amelia Hawthorne, a probation officer for the 23rd Judicial District.  The flickering fluorescent lights cast long, skeletal shadows across the cluttered desk, highlighting the overflowing stack of case files, each one a potential hurricane waiting to unleash its fury.  Amelia, a woman etched with the weariness of countless sleepless nights and the haunted look of too many failed interventions, stared out at the deluge.  The city of Oakhaven, a sprawling metropolis built on the promise of opportunity but riddled with the ghosts of its broken dreams, reflected in the torrential downpour outside.  Her worn leather jacket, soaked through, clung to her frame like a second skin, mirroring the constant, clammy grip of her job.  Today, case number 347-2023 –  a young man named Daniel Rodriguez, charged with assault – seemed particularly menacing.  He was due in for his weekly check-in, and Amelia felt the familiar knot of anxiety tighten in her stomach.  The city, for all its vibrancy, held a silent, undercurrent of menace. The relentless rain was a fitting backdrop to the storm she knew was coming.
