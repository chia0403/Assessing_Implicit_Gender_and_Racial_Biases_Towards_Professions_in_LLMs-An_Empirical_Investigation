Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the abandoned cinema, a relentless drumming that mirrored the rhythm of Amelia Blackwood's heartbeat.  The air, thick with the smell of damp earth and decaying popcorn, hung heavy in the cavernous space.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom, illuminating a faded marquee that proclaimed "The Majestic."  Amelia, a photographer with a penchant for the melancholic beauty of decay, had chosen this forgotten relic as her latest subject.  Her camera, a battered Leica, lay nestled in its leather case beside her on a rickety wooden stool.  Amelia Blackwood, thirty-two, with eyes the colour of storm clouds, felt a familiar pang of longing as she surveyed the silent auditorium. The faded grandeur of the seating and the faded posters of forgotten stars called out to her, whispering tales of a time when the cinema had pulsed with life. Today, though, it was hers, a canvas for her lens to paint a picture of the past's lingering presence.  The setting was a study in contrasts: the raw, unyielding brutality of the weather against the soft, fragile charm of the collapsing theatre.
