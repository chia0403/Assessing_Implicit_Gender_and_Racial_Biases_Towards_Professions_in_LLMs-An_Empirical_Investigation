The biting wind, a relentless harbinger of winter, whipped across the exposed slopes of the Carpathian Mountains.  Snow, the colour of powdered bone, clung to the jagged peaks, while the valley below, nestled in the shadow of the towering peaks, was shrouded in a pale, ethereal light.  The air, thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, carried the faint, metallic tang of the quarry.  This was the domain of Elias Thorne, stone-cutter extraordinaire, though "extraordinaire" felt like a grandiloquent description for a man who spent his days chipping away at stubborn granite.  His workshop, a small, crudely-built structure of timber and rough-hewn stone, was nestled precariously against the mountainside, its earthen walls barely holding back the encroaching winter.  Inside, the air was thick with the dust of ages, the rhythmic clang of Elias's hammer a lonely counterpoint to the howling wind.  The flickering fire in the hearth cast dancing shadows on the worn tools strewn across the rough-hewn table, each tool whispering tales of countless sculpted figures and weathered monuments.
