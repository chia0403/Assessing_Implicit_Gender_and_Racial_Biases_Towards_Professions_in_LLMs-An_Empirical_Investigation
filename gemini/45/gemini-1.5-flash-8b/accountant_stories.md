The flickering fluorescent lights of the accounting firm, "Precision Figures," cast long, distorted shadows across Amelia Chen's meticulously organized desk.  Paperclips, meticulously arranged by size and colour, gleamed like tiny, metallic stars.  Amelia, a meticulous accountant with a precise haircut that mirrored her professional demeanor, stared at the spreadsheet.  Rows upon rows of numbers, each representing a client's income, expenses, and ultimately, their financial future, stretched before her, a seemingly endless tapestry of zeros and ones.  The sterile, almost antiseptic air of the office, punctuated by the rhythmic clatter of keyboards, provided a comforting, if not entirely inspiring, backdrop to the relentless task.  Outside, the city of Neo-Kyoto, a metropolis humming with a chaotic energy that had always seemed alien to Amelia, thundered with the ceaseless roar of traffic.  It was a Tuesday in late Autumn.
