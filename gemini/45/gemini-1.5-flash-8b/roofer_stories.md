The wind, a howling banshee, ripped at the eaves of the Victorian mansion, tugging at Elias Blackwood's already strained muscles.  Rain, the consistency of a hammered lead, plastered the corrugated iron beneath his feet, making each step a precarious dance on a slippery, metal stage.  He was perched precariously on the decaying peak of the roof, his shadowed silhouette barely discernible against the bruised purple sky.  The air, thick with the scent of pine needles and impending storm, whipped around him, carrying the distant cries of gulls and the rhythmic drip, drip, drip of water from a thousand unseen sources.

Elias Blackwood, 32 years old, a roofer by trade and a wanderer by nature, had spent the last decade climbing and fixing roofs across the decaying spires of the North West coast.  He wasn't seeking glory or wealth; instead, he craved the solitude of the heights, the connection to the raw, unforgiving power of the elements. This particular mansion, perched atop a windswept headland overlooking the churning grey sea, was no exception.  It was a crumbling testament to a forgotten era, its ornate gables and weathered brickwork a stark contrast to the harsh beauty of the surrounding landscape.  Sea mist clung to the cliffs below, creating an ethereal veil around the craggy coastline.  Today, however, the mist was a shroud, obscuring the sea itself in a relentless grey.
