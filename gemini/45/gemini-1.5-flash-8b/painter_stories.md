The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine and decaying leaves.  Sunlight, fractured by the dense canopy of the mango trees, dappled Amelia Rose Blackwood's easel, casting shifting patterns across her canvas.  Dust motes danced in the fractured light, pirouetting around the delicate strokes of her brush.  Amelia, a painter of exquisite, almost otherworldly landscapes, sat hunched over her work, lost in the intricate dance of colour and form.  Her studio, nestled in the heart of the crumbling colonial district of San Juan, was a testament to the city's resilience, a labyrinth of faded plaster walls, creaking wooden floors, and the constant hum of cicadas.  Cobwebs clung to forgotten corners, hinting at a history that whispered of forgotten dreams and bustling markets.  An ancient ceramic fountain, chipped and worn, stood in the corner, its water long since dried, reflecting the muted colours of the surrounding walls.  Amelia, clad in a flowing indigo dress,  had been working on this particular painting for weeks, a sweeping vista of the San Juan bay at sunset, capturing the fiery hues of the setting sun as it kissed the waves.
