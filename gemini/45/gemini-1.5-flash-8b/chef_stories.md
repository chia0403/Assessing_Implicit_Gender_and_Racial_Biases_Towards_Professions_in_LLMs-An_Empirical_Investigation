The air in "The Gilded Spoon," hung thick with the aroma of simmering saffron and roasting rosemary.  Sunlight, fractured by the stained-glass windows depicting scenes of ancient feasts, painted dappled patterns across the polished mahogany tables.  This was the heart of Chef Anya Petrova’s culinary kingdom, a small but exquisite restaurant nestled in the cobbled alleyways of the Italianate district of Verona, Italy.  Anya Petrova, a woman whose hands, despite their delicate grace, possessed a surprising strength, meticulously arranged a final flourish of fresh basil leaves on a plate of her signature pasta dish, the “Verona Kiss.”  Tonight, the restaurant hummed with the excited chatter of patrons, anticipating the evening’s special: a tasting menu celebrating the harvest of autumn.  But Anya, her brow furrowed slightly, noticed a subtle, almost imperceptible change in the air. A chill, deeper than the crisp autumn breeze, settled over her, a quiet tremor that seemed to emanate from the shadows of the room, and she felt a prickle of unease.  Outside, the usually vibrant chatter of the alley was muted, replaced by an unnerving silence.
