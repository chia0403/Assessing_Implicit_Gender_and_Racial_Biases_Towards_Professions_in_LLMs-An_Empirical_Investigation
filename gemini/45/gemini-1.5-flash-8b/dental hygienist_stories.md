The fluorescent hum of the dental clinic, a constant, low thrumming, vibrated through Elara Hawthorne’s gloved hands as she meticulously polished a set of pearly white teeth.  The sterile scent of antiseptic mingled with the faint, cloying sweetness of mint breath fresheners, a familiar symphony accompanying her every shift.  Outside, the city of Veridian pulsed with a life that never quite reached the hushed sanctuary of Dr. Aris’s practice.  Veridian, a sprawling metropolis built on a patchwork of forgotten canals and towering, glass skyscrapers, was a city of constant motion, and the clinic, tucked away on a quiet side street, offered a temporary refuge from its relentless rhythm. Elara, a dental hygienist with a practiced efficiency and a quiet determination, found solace in the precise, repetitive movements of her work.  Each painstaking clean, each perfectly placed fluoride treatment, was a miniature act of restoration, a tiny rebellion against the relentless march of time.  The rhythmic tapping of her instruments against enamel was a lullaby, a comforting counterpoint to the city’s restless pulse.
