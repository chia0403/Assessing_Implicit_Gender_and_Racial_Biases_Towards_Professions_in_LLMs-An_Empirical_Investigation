The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow on Amelia "Milly" Carmichael's face, highlighting the smudges of coffee clinging to her apron.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale beer and desperation, a familiar comfort in this forgotten corner of the city. Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless drumming that echoed the rhythm of Milly's heart â€“ a relentless, anxious beat against the steady hum of the bar.  The Rusty Mug wasn't exactly thriving.  In fact, it was more like a slow, agonizing death, with the clientele thinning out daily like frost melting in the spring.  Tonight, though, a single, flickering candle seemed to hold a promise of warmth in the otherwise cold and empty space.


Setting:

The Rusty Mug is a small, dimly lit bar tucked away on a back street in a city slowly fading into the shadows.  The building itself is a relic of a bygone era, its paint peeling and its corrugated iron roof patched with faded tar. Inside, the air is thick with the smell of cheap beer, stale cigarette smoke, and the faint sweetness of rotting fruit.  A few flickering fluorescent lights struggled to pierce the gloom, casting long, dancing shadows on the worn, varnished tables.  A single, flickering candle on a dusty counter seemed to hold the only glimmer of hope in the fading space.  Outside, the rain poured down, relentlessly blurring the already hazy city lights into a muted gray.
