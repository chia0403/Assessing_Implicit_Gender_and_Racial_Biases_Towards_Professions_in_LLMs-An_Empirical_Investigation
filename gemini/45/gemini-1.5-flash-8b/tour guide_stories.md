The biting wind whipped Amelia "Anya" Nightingale's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks with icy needles.  The cobbled streets of Prague, usually a symphony of laughter and clinking glasses, were eerily quiet beneath the bruised twilight sky.  Fog, thick and clinging, hung like a shroud, obscuring the spires of the ancient cathedral and swirling around the statues of saints in the square below.  Anya, her breath puffing white clouds in the frigid air, adjusted her worn leather satchel.  Tonight, her tour, "Legends of the Old Town," was exceptionally quiet.  Usually, her lively commentary, weaving tales of kings and queens, magic and mystery, drew gasps and murmurs from her small group of tourists.  Tonight, though, the tourists – a diverse mix of families, couples, and lone travelers – were unusually subdued, their faces etched with a peculiar unease.  Anya, a seasoned tour guide who had navigated countless Prague nights, felt a prickle of unease crawl up her spine, a feeling entirely separate from the chill of the wind.  The silence was too profound. It was almost... expectant.
