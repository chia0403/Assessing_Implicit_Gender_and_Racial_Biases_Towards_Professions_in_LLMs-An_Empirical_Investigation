The humid air hung thick and heavy over the grand lobby of the Astorian Hotel, clinging to the polished mahogany furniture like a damp shroud.  Dust motes danced in the pale afternoon sun filtering through the enormous arched windows, illuminating swirling patterns of the intricate parquet floor.  This was the realm of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, bell hop extraordinaire, or so he hoped.  He wiped the condensation from the brass handle of a newly delivered trunk, the faint scent of jasmine and old paper clinging to the polished surface.  The weight of the world, or at least the weighty burden of delivering suitcases and fetching forgotten umbrellas, pressed down on Barty.  He sighed, a barely audible puff of air in the symphony of clanking luggage carts and hushed whispers.  Today, though, a different kind of weight sat heavier still:  the weight of a forgotten appointment.
