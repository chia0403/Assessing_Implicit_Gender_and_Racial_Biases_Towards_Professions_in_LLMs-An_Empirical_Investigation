The wind, a relentless, whispering beast, whipped across the parched plains, carrying the scent of sagebrush and something acrid, something metallic, that clung to Elias Thorne's nostrils like a shroud.  Dust devils danced across the cracked earth, mimicking the frantic skittering of the few remaining ground squirrels in the desolate valley.  Elias, weathered and lean as a desert cactus, squinted at the horizon, the sun a merciless eye burning down on the desolate landscape.  He was a man carved from the very bones of this land, his hands calloused and his eyes the color of dried mud, reflecting the harsh beauty of the Wyoming Badlands.  His ranch, the "Sunstone" spread across several hundred acres like a tattered banner in a fierce wind. It had once been a flourishing domain, a testament to his grandfather's tireless work, but now, the drought had bled the land dry.  It was a struggle for survival, and Elias felt the pressure of the dwindling water supply, the encroaching whispers of the bank, the persistent, gnawing fear of failure, a heavy weight on his broad shoulders.
