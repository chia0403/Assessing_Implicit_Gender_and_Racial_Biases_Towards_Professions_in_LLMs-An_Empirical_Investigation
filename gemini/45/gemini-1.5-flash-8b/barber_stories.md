The chipped porcelain sink, stained a faded ochre from decades of lukewarm water and the occasional rogue splash of peroxide, hummed a faint counterpoint to the rhythmic snip-snip of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's clippers.  Sunlight, filtered through the grime-streaked windowpanes of "The Snip-Snap," cast long, distorted shadows across the tiny barbershop.  Dust motes danced in the air, illuminated by the lone bulb hanging precariously from the ceiling, a flickering sentinel against the encroaching twilight.  This was Barty's sanctuary, his kingdom of neatly-clipped heads and whispered secrets.  The year was 1928, and the Great Depression was beginning to cast a long shadow over the small, forgotten town of Havenwood.
