The biting wind whipped at Amelia "Milly"  Harding's hardhat, stinging her cheeks with icy needles.  Above, the skeletal framework of the new "Skybridge" – a breathtaking, futuristic arch spanning the city – reached towards the bruised purple sky.  Construction dust, the colour of iron oxide and despair, swirled around her boots, coating everything in a gritty film.  The air, thin and frigid at this altitude, was punctuated by the incessant clang of metal on metal, the rhythmic groan of heavy machinery, and the muted cries of her co-workers – a symphony of exhaustion and determination echoing across the vast, exposed expanse.  This was the 22nd floor of the Skybridge construction site, a precarious perch clinging to the edge of the city.  Below, the skyscrapers of New Zenith, shimmering under the harsh glare of the setting sun, looked like glittering, miniature monuments to human ambition. Milly, though, felt nothing but the gnawing emptiness of the impending winter and the relentless weight of her responsibilities.
