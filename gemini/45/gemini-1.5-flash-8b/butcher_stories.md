The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the cobblestones of Spitalfields, illuminating the grime-coated exterior of "The Cleaver's Cut."  Rain, a relentless, icy drizzle, hammered against the corrugated iron roof, mimicking the frantic rhythm of Bartholomew "Barty" Hemlock's own heartbeat.  Barty, a man whose face, etched with the relentless grind of a lifetime spent cleaving meat, was pale even by the dim light, stood at the stall’s entrance.  He adjusted the strap of his leather apron, the familiar weight a comforting ballast against the tempest brewing within. Inside, the aroma of roasting venison and the sharp tang of freshly-cut pork mingled with the damp earth, a pungent symphony only intensified by the chill night air.  Spitalfields, a bustling district of London in 1888, throbbed with the sounds of the city—the clanging of horse-drawn carts, the distant cries of hawkers, the murmur of unseen conversations—all forming a backdrop to Barty's solitary vigil.  He knew the night held a particular, almost tangible dread, a sense of impending doom that clung to the air like the miasma itself.
