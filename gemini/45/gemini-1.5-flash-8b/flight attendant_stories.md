The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine and something subtly metallic, like old, polished brass.  Amelia  "Amy"  Carter, her name a whispered echo in the hushed cabin, adjusted the strap of her uniform, the crisp polyester a stark contrast to the stifling heat.  Outside, the turquoise waters of the Caribbean churned beneath a sky the colour of bruised plums.  She stared out the porthole, the endless expanse of the ocean a stark reminder of the vastness beyond the confines of the Boeing 787.  Tonight's flight, from St. Lucia to Barbados, was usually a quiet one. Tonight, it felt different.  A tremor, almost imperceptible, pulsed through the plane, a subtle shudder beneath the veneer of smooth, controlled flight.

The setting was the upper deck of a Boeing 787 Dreamliner,  its interior a polished blend of sleek, modern design.  Dim, warm cabin lights illuminated the rows of seats, each occupied by travellers in various stages of sleep or quiet conversation.  The rhythmic hum of the engines, usually a comforting background, seemed to thrum with an unnerving urgency. The air was filled with the low, almost imperceptible hiss of air conditioning, a sound amplified in the near-silence of the night.  A faint smell of burnt sugar drifted through the cabin from somewhere in the galley, adding to the atmosphere of unease.  Outside, the vast, inky blackness of the night sky, punctuated by the distant glow of city lights, looked almost menacing, mirroring the growing tension Amy felt within.
