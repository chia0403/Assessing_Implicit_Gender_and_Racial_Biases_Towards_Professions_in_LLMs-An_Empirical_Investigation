Rain hammered against the leaded windows of the Grand Theatre, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic rhythm of Elara Nightingale’s thoughts.  The year was 1928.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom, illuminating a vast, cavernous space – the theatre’s rehearsal hall – filled with the ghostly remnants of a production that had, just hours before, felt alive.  Discarded props, crumpled costumes, and half-eaten sandwiches lay strewn about like battlefield debris.  Elara, her emerald eyes shadowed by the theatrical gloom, paced the stage, a tempest brewing within her.  Her tailored, midnight-blue suit, though slightly rumpled, clung to her like a second skin, a testament to the relentless hours she'd invested in the doomed revival of "The Raven's Shadow."
