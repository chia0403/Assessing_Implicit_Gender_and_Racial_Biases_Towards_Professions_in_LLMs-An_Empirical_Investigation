The fluorescent hum of the lab, a constant low thrumming counterpoint to the rhythmic click-clack of Dr. Elara Vance's meticulously clean boots, was the only sound in the cavernous space.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight piercing the sterile white walls of the Cryogenic Research Facility.  Outside, the city of Neo-Kyoto pulsed with a life Elara rarely experienced, a kaleidoscope of light and sound muted by the thick, reinforced concrete walls of this subterranean fortress.  This particular section, designated Project Chimera, housed a series of cryogenic pods, each a silent, metallic tomb holding the potential for breakthroughs in regenerative medicine, orâ€¦perhaps something far more dangerous.
