The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine and something faintly metallic, like old pennies left out in the rain.  Rain, in fact, had been falling incessantly for three days, turning the cobbled streets of the historic district into slick, glistening mirrors reflecting the pale, overcast sky.  Amelia "Amy"  Featherstone, meticulously tracing the outline of a kaleidoscope of vegetables on a notepad, sighed.  Another day, another barrage of complaints from clients struggling to balance their dietary needs with the relentless, flavour-drenched temptations of the city.  Amy, a registered dietitian with a particular passion for Ayurvedic principles, was well-versed in the delicate dance between healthy eating and the vibrant, sensory tapestry of Jaipur.  Her small, brightly coloured clinic, nestled amongst shops selling intricately carved woodwork and spicy chutneys, was an oasis of order in this chaotic, colourful metropolis.  The rhythmic drip-drip-drip of the monsoon mingled with the soft thrumming of the nearby havelis, ancient mansions dripping with history and tradition. This was her world:  the bustling heart of Jaipur, where the finest spices vied with the finest ingredients for attention, and where Amy, the quiet observer, meticulously sought to guide her clients towards a healthier, more vibrant existence.
