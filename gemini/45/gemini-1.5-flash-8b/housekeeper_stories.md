The chipped porcelain sink, stained a sickly yellow from decades of lukewarm water and forgotten tea leaves, reflected the pale, bruised light filtering through the grimy windowpanes of the Blackwood Manor.  Dust motes danced in the solitary beam, swirling around Amelia Blackwood, her name echoing the imposing, gothic grandeur of the house she now called home.  Amelia Blackwood, housekeeper, was mid-scrubbing the mahogany banister when a faint, almost imperceptible, scratching sound, like a tiny bird trapped in a dusty attic, snaked through the stillness.
Â 
The Blackwood Manor stood perched atop a windswept hill, its many turrets and gothic arches swallowed by a perpetual twilight.  A dense, ancient oak, gnarled and twisted like a skeletal hand, clawed at the slate roof, its roots a silent testament to the manor's age.  Ivy, thick and emerald green, had reclaimed sections of the stone walls, blurring the line between the house and the encroaching wilderness.  Inside, the house felt equally aged; the air thick with the scent of mildew and forgotten memories.  Dust motes danced in the sunbeams that, even at midday, only barely pierced the oppressive gloom.  It was a house that breathed history, a history Amelia was now tasked with maintaining, one stained teacup and creaking floorboard at a time.
