The biting wind whipped across the desolate expanse of the Nevada desert, stinging Amelia "Milly"  Stone's cheeks and stinging her eyes with a gritty sand.  Sunrise, a pale, bruised fingernail against the horizon, offered little solace.  Milly, a highway maintenance worker with calloused hands and eyes the color of a storm-tossed sea, tightened her grip on the worn leather straps of her tool belt.  Ahead, a section of Interstate 80 stretched out like a shimmering ribbon of asphalt, a ribbon that, in the harsh morning light, held a secret.  This particular stretch of highway, known locally as "The Ghost Route," had always had a peculiar reputation.  Rumors swirled like dust devils, whispered by locals over burnt coffee and in the hushed tones of the lonely towns along its path.


Setting:

The story unfolds along a desolate stretch of Interstate 80, weaving through the sun-baked, seemingly endless expanse of the Nevada desert.  The highway, dubbed "The Ghost Route" by the locals, cuts a path through a landscape of jagged canyons, barren mesas, and lonely ghost towns.  The air hangs heavy and dry, punctuated only by the occasional howl of a coyote or the distant rumble of a passing truck.  Small, isolated towns like Calico Springs and Lost Mesa, with their faded storefronts and skeletal buildings, pepper the route, each harboring secrets and legends that feed the whispers about the highway.  The unforgiving heat and silence of the desert create a palpable sense of isolation, a place where the past clings to the present like stubborn dust.
