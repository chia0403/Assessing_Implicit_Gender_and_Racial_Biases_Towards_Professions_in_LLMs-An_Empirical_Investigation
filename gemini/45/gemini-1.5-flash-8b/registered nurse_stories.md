The fluorescent lights of the emergency room hummed, a monotonous counterpoint to the rhythmic thud of Amelia Hayes's heart.  Sweat prickled her brow, not from the oppressive heat, but from the mounting anxiety.  Outside, the city throbbed with its own chaotic symphony â€“ sirens wailing, traffic rumbling, the distant clang of metal on metal. Inside, the sterile white walls seemed to press in, amplifying the tension.  It was 2:17 AM, and the emergency room of St. Jude's Hospital, nestled in the heart of the sprawling, perpetually-noisy metropolis of New Zenith, was already overflowing. Amelia, a registered nurse with five years of experience, was exhausted, yet every call-sign, every urgent beep from a monitor, demanded her attention.  Tonight, the pressure was different, a thick, almost tangible weight that settled over the room like a pre-dawn fog.  A particular urgency hung in the air, a collective sigh of impending trouble.
