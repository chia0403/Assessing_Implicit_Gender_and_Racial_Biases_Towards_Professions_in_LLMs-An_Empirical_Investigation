The chipped Formica countertop reflected Dr. Eleanor Vance's weary face.  Rain hammered against the single, grimy window of her tiny office, a relentless percussion mirroring the storm brewing inside her.  Outside, the city of Veridia sprawled, a concrete jungle choked by pollution and shrouded in perpetual twilight.  Veridia was a place where shadows held more stories than the sunlit streets could tell, and Eleanor, a counseling psychologist specializing in trauma recovery, was a witness to them all.

Her tiny, cluttered office, located in a dilapidated building on the edge of the cityâ€™s underbelly, was a refuge of sorts.  Stacks of case files, overflowing with the anxieties, fears, and unspoken traumas of her clients, lined the walls.  A single, worn armchair sat facing a battered oak desk, the only furniture in the space.  A flickering fluorescent light cast an eerie glow on the faded floral wallpaper, a relic of a bygone era when Veridia had known a fleeting moment of vibrancy.  The air, thick with the scent of stale coffee and antiseptic, held the weight of the city's unspoken burdens.
