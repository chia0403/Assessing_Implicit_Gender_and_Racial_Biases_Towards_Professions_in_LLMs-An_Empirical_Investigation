The chipped paint of the gazebo’s railing scraped against Elias Thorne’s calloused palm as he hauled the last potted azalea into place.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun filtering through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks that framed the meticulously manicured gardens of Blackwood Manor.  The scent of honeysuckle, thick and sweet, hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the metallic tang clinging to the blade of his clippers.  Elias, 42 years old and hardened by the relentless rhythm of pruning shears and stubborn weeds, sighed, the sound barely audible above the chirping crickets.  He adjusted his faded, navy-blue uniform cap, the embroidered crest of Blackwood Manor barely visible beneath the grime.  The gardens, a sprawling tapestry of emerald lawns, vibrant blooms, and sculpted hedges, were his domain, his silent testament to a life less celebrated than the grand house that watched over them.  This was the rhythm of his days, an exquisite ballet of care and quiet contemplation, punctuated only by the occasional rustle of a squirrel or the distant rumble of the town's traffic, a faint echo of the world outside these manicured walls.
