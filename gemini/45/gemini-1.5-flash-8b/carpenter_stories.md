The biting November wind howled a mournful dirge through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks surrounding the village of Oakhaven.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom, illuminating the workshop of Elias Thorne, carpenter.  Elias, a man whose hands, weathered and calloused like the bark of the very trees he shaped, were currently wrestling with a stubborn knot in a beam of seasoned oak.  He swore under his breath, a sound lost in the symphony of the wind and the creaking of the old timbers.  His workshop, a sprawling structure built of rough-hewn logs and cobwebs, was nestled at the edge of the village, a testament to the quiet solitude Elias valued.  The air smelled of pine, sawdust, and damp earth, a familiar scent that had been Elias's constant companion since he was a boy.  His worn leather apron, stained with countless shades of wood, hung from his shoulders.  The single, flickering lamp hanging from the ceiling cast long shadows across the tools scattered haphazardly on the workbench â€“ chisels, planes, saws, each imbued with a lifetime of stories.  Outside, the village square, usually bustling with villagers going about their daily affairs, was eerily empty. The wind seemed to whisper tales of impending winter, and Elias felt a premonition of something more than just the usual quiet before the frosty season.
