The aroma of cinnamon and freshly baked sourdough hung thick in the air, a comforting blanket against the biting November wind whistling through the gaps in the crumbling stone walls of the bakery.  Snow, the consistency of powdered sugar, had begun to fall softly, blanketing the cobblestone streets of  Old St. Jude's with a pristine white.  This was Elias Thorne's sanctuary, his "Little Hearth," a small, family-run bakery nestled at the heart of the oldest quarter of the city.  Elias, a man whose hands, roughened by years of kneading dough and shaping loaves, were as warm and welcoming as his smile,  stood meticulously arranging a tray of  "Autumn Moon"  cakes, each a delicate masterpiece of spiced pumpkin and cinnamon, the icing frosted with a constellation of sugar stars.  The rhythmic click-clack of his wooden shoes against the flagstones accompanied the gentle hiss of steam rising from the still-hot oven.  He loved the way the snow painted the world in muted hues, a canvas for the warm colours of his creations.  The faint chime of a bell above the door heralded a customer, and Elias,  with a sigh of contentment, turned towards the entrance.
