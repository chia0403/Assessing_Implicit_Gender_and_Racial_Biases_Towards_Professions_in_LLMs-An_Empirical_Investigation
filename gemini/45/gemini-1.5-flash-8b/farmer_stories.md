Dust, stirred from the parched earth by the ferocious gusts, swirled around his weathered boots, obscuring the already rutted track that snaked towards his farmhouse, a tiny, dilapidated structure clinging precariously to the hillside like a wounded bird.  The farmhouse, with its roof warped like an aged parchment, was nestled in a valley so deep and remote that even the crows seemed to shy away from its desolate beauty.  A single, flickering candlelight illuminated the gloom within, a fragile beacon against the encroaching night.  Elias, his face etched with lines that spoke of a life lived in the harsh embrace of the valley's unforgiving seasons, shivered, pulling his wool cap lower.  The year was 1887, and the harvest had failed once more.
