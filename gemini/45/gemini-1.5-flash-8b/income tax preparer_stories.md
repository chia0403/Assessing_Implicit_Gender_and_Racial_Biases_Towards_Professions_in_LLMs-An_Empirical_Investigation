The fluorescent lights of the "Tax Relief Express" hummed, a relentless soundtrack to Amelia Blackwood's weary existence.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grimy window of her tiny cubicle, illuminating the mountain of tax forms piled precariously on her desk.  Paper, like a suffocating blanket, smothered everything around her.  The aroma of stale coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air, a potent cocktail Amelia had become alarmingly accustomed to.  She was a tax preparer, an income tax warrior in a war she often felt she was losing.  The year was 2024, and the IRS was relentless in its pursuit of every dollar.

Amelia, a woman of thirty-five with tired eyes and a perpetually rumpled cardigan, stared at the latest batch of forms.  A single, dried-out flower pressed between the pages of a 1040 caught her attention.  A tiny, faded red rose.  It was a memento from her grandfather, a gift that had somehow found its way into her cluttered tax filing system.  A bittersweet smile touched her lips, a fleeting moment of warmth in the cold, clinical space.  Sheâ€™d felt a little more personally invested in the success of this tax season, one that was more stressful than any she could remember, and the quiet contemplation of this gift helped her cope.
