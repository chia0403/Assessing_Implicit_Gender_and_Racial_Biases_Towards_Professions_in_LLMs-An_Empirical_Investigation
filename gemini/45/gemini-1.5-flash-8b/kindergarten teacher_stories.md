The chipped paint on the kindergarten classroom walls, a faded, almost forgotten shade of lavender, seemed to sigh with the afternoon sun streaming through the dusty windows.  Dust motes danced in the golden light, swirling like tiny, ethereal butterflies.  This was Miss Amelia Blackwoodâ€™s domain, a carefully curated haven of colourful construction paper, meticulously arranged playdough, and the ever-present, slightly overwhelming scent of crayons.  Amelia, a woman whose gentle eyes held the wisdom of a thousand quiet afternoons, surveyed her charges.  Little Lily, with her meticulously painted fingernails, meticulously recreated the day's lesson of "happy trees" on a piece of paper.  Across the room, Leo, a whirlwind of energetic elbows and slightly frantic movements, was meticulously (and loudly) attempting to assemble a tower of blocks that stubbornly refused to stay upright.  Amelia smiled, a small, knowing smile that crinkled the corners of her eyes.  The chaos was a part of her world, and she found it both beautiful and utterly exhausting.
