The biting November wind whipped Amelia Hawthorne's trench coat around her legs as she hurried down the cobbled street of Spitalfields.  Rain, slick and persistent, plastered her auburn hair to her scalp, and the faint scent of roasted chestnuts, a comforting aroma in other circumstances, was lost in the grey murk.  London, in all its moody magnificence, was a backdrop to Ameliaâ€™s daily grind.  She was a real estate agent, specializing in the quirky, the characterful, and the sometimes downright dilapidated properties that clung to the heart of the city.  This particular morning, however, her focus wasn't on Victorian terraces or modern penthouses.  This morning, she was chasing a ghost.

Setting: Spitalfields, London, England.  A neighbourhood steeped in history, with narrow, winding streets flanked by historic warehouses, converted lofts, and the occasional, stubbornly maintained Victorian townhouse.  The area buzzed with a vibrant energy, a mix of street food vendors, independent boutiques, and the constant murmur of hurried footsteps.  The pervasive dampness and the architectural idiosyncrasies of the area were almost tangible, as though the city itself held secrets waiting to be unearthed.
