The biting wind howled a mournful dirge through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks lining the perimeter of Blackwood Forest.  Rain, the consistency of gritty gravel, plastered Amelia "Ames"  Charleston's  fire-resistant jacket to her skin.  The flickering neon sign of the Blackwood Forest Fire Department, a faded and slightly askew emerald green, cast a sickly glow on the rusted fire truck parked outside the station, its metal body pitted with the marks of countless nights battled against the wilderness's fury. Ames, a seasoned firefighter with ten years under her belt, felt the familiar knot tightening in her stomach.  This wasn't just another forest fire. The whispers started last week, rumors of something unnatural about the flames, something that refused to be tamed.

**Setting:** The Blackwood Forest Fire Department station sits nestled at the edge of Blackwood Forest, a dense and ancient woodland known for its isolation and cryptic history. The station, a somewhat dilapidated building of weathered wood and aging metal, was more used to dealing with the forestâ€™s occasional brush fires than the inferno that currently ravaged its depths. The air, thick with smoke and the scent of pine and damp earth, carried an almost palpable sense of unease.  The forest itself seemed to hold its breath, the stillness only broken by the crackling of flames and the mournful cry of unseen creatures.
