The fluorescent lights of the "Everything for the Exquisitely Organized Home" store hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia Butterfield's life.  Rows of gleaming stainless steel organizers, meticulously arranged, lined the aisles.  Amelia, a salesperson with a perpetually tired smile and perpetually messy bun, stared at the latest shipment of nesting storage bins.  They were, in her opinion, utterly pointless.  Every week, the same customers came in, searching for the *perfect* solution to their overflowing closets, only to leave with a half-dozen bins that ended up crammed full ofâ€¦well, more stuff.  The irony wasn't lost on Amelia, though she rarely allowed it to show.  The store's meticulously curated atmosphere, a testament to the "perfect" life, felt increasingly like a gilded cage.  Today, however, things seemed different.  A new customer, a woman with piercing green eyes and a quiet intensity, had just approached the display.  This could be the beginning of something... or just another frustratingly unsatisfying sale.
