The fluorescent hum of the hallway buzzed, a low, insistent drone that seemed to vibrate through Amelia Stone, School Psychologist, right down to her aching feet.  It was a Wednesday, the kind of day that felt like a relentless tide pulling at the edges of sanity.  The chipped paint on the walls of Northwood High, a faded ochre now more beige, reflected the dullness.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of afternoon sun piercing the gloom, illuminating the faint, almost invisible graffiti scrawled on the lockersâ€”a swirling vortex of angst and teenage rebellion.  Amelia, her shoulders slumped slightly, navigated the throng of students, each a miniature storm cloud of angst and potential.  Her worn-leather briefcase felt heavy against her arm.  Another case file, another tangled web of emotional threads to untangle.  Today's case study involved a senior named Liam O'Connell, a seemingly ordinary student masking a deep, hidden struggle.  The problem, as she knew from initial contact, was far more complex than a simple disciplinary issue.
