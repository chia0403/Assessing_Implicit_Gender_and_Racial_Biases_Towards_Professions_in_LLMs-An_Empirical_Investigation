The flickering fluorescent lights of Dr. Eleanor Vance’s dental office hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *tap-tap-tap* of her instruments on enamel.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun slicing through the grime-streaked windows, illuminating a small, cluttered space that smelled faintly of antiseptic and fear.  Eleanor, a woman whose sharp, angular features were softened only by the faintest hint of a smile playing on her lips, focused intently on the patient’s trembling jaw.  The patient, a young woman named Anya Petrova, was terrified.  The small, almost invisible crack in her molar, a seemingly insignificant detail to the untrained eye, was a mountain of anxiety for Anya.

**Setting:**

Dr. Vance’s office, a small, cramped space nestled in the heart of a bustling but decaying industrial district.  The peeling paint on the walls matched the fading grandeur of the faded brick building itself.  Dusty porcelain dolls stared blankly from shelves lining the walls, their painted eyes seeming to observe the hushed drama unfolding before them.  The air, thick with the smell of old textbooks and disinfectant, carried faint whispers of the neighborhood’s past – echoes of factory workers and bustling markets.  A single potted fern, its leaves a sickly green, stood in a corner as a fragile testament to life in the otherwise grey surroundings.
