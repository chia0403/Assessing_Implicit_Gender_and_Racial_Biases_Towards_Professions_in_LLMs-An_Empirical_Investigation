The chipped paint of the Mrs. Henderson's classroom door, a faded, sickly yellow, seemed to sigh in the humid afternoon air.  Sunlight, fractured by the leaves of the ancient oak outside, dappled the worn wooden floor.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of light piercing the gloom of the room, illuminating a half-eaten sandwich on a chipped plastic tray, a misplaced crayon, and the ubiquitous, slightly-too-loud hum of the fluorescent lights.  This was Miss Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's domain, a sanctuary of colourful drawings, meticulously-organized alphabet charts, and the comforting, if somewhat predictable, rhythm of a first-grade classroom.  Today, however, the rhythm was off-key.  The usual chatter of excited children was muted, replaced by an almost palpable tension.
