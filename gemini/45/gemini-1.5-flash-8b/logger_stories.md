The biting wind, a relentless claw of ice, ripped at the tattered collar of Silas Blackwood's worn flannel shirt.  He squinted, his breath fogging in the frigid air, tracing the jagged silhouette of the towering pines that clawed at the bruised, overcast sky.  The year was 1889, and the land, a vast, unforgiving wilderness stretching from the foothills of the Cascade Mountains to the edge of the coastal rainforest, was the very breath of Silas's being.  He was a logger, a son of the forest, born and bred to the rhythm of the axe and the groan of falling timber.  This particular stretch of the Oregon Territory, known locally as the Blackwood Cut, was his domain, though it felt less like a domain and more like a demanding, unforgiving mistress.  The air, thick with the scent of pine needles and damp earth, carried the echoes of the distant, relentless saws, a symphony of destruction that both terrified and exhilarated him.

Silas Blackwood, with his weathered face etched with the stories of a thousand storms and the lines of countless hours spent beneath the canopy of ancient trees, wasn't looking for easy.  He craved the challenge, the raw power of felling a giant, the thrill of the unpredictable. Today, though, the challenge felt different.  A gnawing unease, a premonition of something amiss, settled heavy in his gut.  The forest, usually a silent, watchful guardian, seemed to hold its breath, its whispers growing louder, the shadows deepening, the air itself thick with a nameless dread. He had always trusted the forest, but today, something felt profoundly wrong.
