The fluorescent hum of the server room, a constant, low thrumming that vibrated through Amelia Petrova’s shoes, was the soundtrack to her life.  Rows upon rows of shimmering metal cabinets, each a miniature universe of blinking lights and whirring fans, stretched as far as the eye could see.  Dust motes danced in the pale beams of the overhead lights, illuminating the intricate pathways of cables, the complex network that held the digital backbone of the entire city. Amelia, a systems analyst for GlobalCommTech, was intimately familiar with this space. It was her domain, her temple.  For five years, she’d been wrestling with the complexities of their interwoven data streams, navigating the labyrinthine code and troubleshooting the almost sentient glitches that plagued the network.  Tonight, however, something was different.  Not a glitch, not a slowdown, but something deeper, something…unnatural.  A persistent, almost imperceptible fluctuation in the quantum entanglement algorithms had sparked, for the first time in months, a deep resonance within the system.  It wasn't breaking, not yet. But the tremor was undeniable.  And she couldn't ignore it.
