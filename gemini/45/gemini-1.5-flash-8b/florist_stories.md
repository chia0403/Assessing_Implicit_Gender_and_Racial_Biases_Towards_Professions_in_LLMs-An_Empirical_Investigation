The aroma of lilies, jasmine, and something faintly metallic hung heavy in the air of Amelia Blackwood's tiny shop, "Blooms by the Bay."  Sunlight, filtered through the lace-curtained windows, painted the shelves in shifting patterns of gold and emerald.  Dried ferns, meticulously arranged, cascaded from the high ceilings, whispering tales of forgotten summers.  Amelia, a wisp of a woman with eyes the colour of forget-me-nots and hands that moved with the grace of a hummingbird, was meticulously arranging a bouquet of crimson roses.  Each stem was precisely positioned, each petal perfectly aligned, reflecting a quiet, almost meditative focus.  Outside, the ceaseless clang of the shipyard echoed across the bay, a constant reminder of the industrial heart of the city, a world Amelia rarely ventured into.  She preferred the hushed quiet of her shop, the delicate whispers of the flowers, and the soothing rhythm of the waves crashing against the distant shores.
