The biting wind whipped Amelia Eleanor Davies's crimson coat around her legs, stinging her cheeks with icy particles.  The frosted landscape of the High Peak stretched out before her, a stark, monochrome canvas punctuated only by the skeletal branches of ancient oaks and the occasional, forlorn-looking sheep huddled against the biting wind.  A lone, snow-laden mountain peak, its summit obscured by a swirling veil of mist, dominated the horizon.

For years, she had yearned for this remote practice, for the solitude of the High Peak and the unique challenges it presented.  Now, the biting wind and the desolate silence were not unwelcome intrusions but rather familiar comforters.  Today, a frantic call had brought her to the precipice of a sheepfold.
