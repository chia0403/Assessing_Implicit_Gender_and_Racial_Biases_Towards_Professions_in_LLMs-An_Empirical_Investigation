The aroma of industrial strength cleaner, mixed with the faintest hint of crayon wax, always greeted Eliza Mae Hawthorne each morning. It was the smell of Room 204, her kingdom, her battleground, and her home away from home. Sunlight, weak and watery in November, streamed through the tall, grimy windows of Crestwood Elementary, casting long shadows from the construction paper turkeys Eliza had painstakingly hung the day before. Crestwood itself was a squat, red brick building, a relic from the 1950s perched precariously on the less-than-affluent side of Willow Creek, Ohio. The playground, mostly asphalt and rust-colored jungle gym equipment, sat eerily still at this early hour, devoid of the shrieks and laughter that usually echoed across the blacktop. Eliza shivered, despite the radiator already clanking dutifully in the corner. She had a feeling it was going to be a long day. A very, very long day.
