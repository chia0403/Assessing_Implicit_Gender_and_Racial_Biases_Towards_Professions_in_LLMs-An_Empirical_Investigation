## Story Opening:

The rain was a relentless percussion on the cab of "The Iron Maiden," a drumming that mirrored the ache in Jedidiah "Jed" McKinley's lower back. He squinted, the wipers battling the downpour that blurred the ribbon of asphalt unspooling beneath his eighteen wheels. Outside, the world was a watercolor smear of gray and green. Inside, the Maiden smelled of stale coffee, diesel fumes, and the faint, lingering scent of his grandfatherâ€™s pipe tobacco, a ghost of comfort in the lonely expanse of the highway.

He hadn't seen another vehicle in the last hour, not since he passed that beat-up pickup with the busted taillight a few miles back. The radio crackled with static, offering nothing but the drone of the storm and a low hum of anxiety. This stretch of Highway 12, notorious for its unexpected landslides and sheer drop-offs, was always a gamble, but tonight it felt especially malevolent, like the storm itself was daring him to push on. Jedidiah gripped the steering wheel tighter, his knuckles white. He had a delivery to make, and even a storm like this wasn't going to stop him. Not yet.

## Setting:

**Location:** A remote stretch of Highway 12, snaking through the mountainous forests of western Washington State.

**Time:** Late October, early evening. The days are short, the weather is unpredictable, and the first hints of winter are already biting at the edges of the landscape.

**Atmosphere:** Gloomy, isolated, and fraught with a sense of foreboding. The combination of the storm, the desolate highway, and the rugged terrain creates an atmosphere of vulnerability and potential danger. The isolation amplifies every sound, every flicker of movement, making Jedidiah feel utterly alone and exposed to the elements.
