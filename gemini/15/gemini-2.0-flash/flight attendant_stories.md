## Story Opening:

The turbulence hit with a ferocity that sent a shiver down Amelia Stone's spine, not just because of the unexpected jolt, but because of the unsettling silence that followed. Usually, a good bump would elicit a murmur of nervous laughter, a tightening of seatbelts, a few muttered prayers. This time, though, it was as if everyone on board had simultaneously sucked in their breath and forgotten how to exhale. Amelia, ever the professional, forced a smile and tightened her grip on the beverage cart, its wheels squealing a pathetic protest against the bucking aircraft.

"Ladies and gentlemen," she announced, her voice a calm soprano that belied the hammering of her heart, "we're experiencing a bit of mild turbulence. Please return to your seats and fasten your seatbelts. We'll have this sorted out shortly."

She risked a glance down the aisle of the Boeing 777, a wave of nausea rising as she did. Several passengers had gone pale, their eyes wide and fixed on the overhead compartments. Even the seasoned business travelers, usually impervious to anything short of a nosedive, looked distinctly uncomfortable.

Then, the lights flickered. And a collective gasp rippled through the cabin, finally breaking the unnerving silence. Amelia knew, with a certainty that burrowed deep into her bones, that this was far from a bit of mild turbulence.

## Setting:

**Location:** Mid-Atlantic Ocean. The flight, Zenith Airlines Flight 427, originated from London Heathrow and is en route to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City.

**Time:** 8:47 PM GMT (3:47 PM EST). The sun has already set over the Atlantic, plunging the vast expanse of water below into inky blackness. Above, a scattering of stars begins to pierce the twilight.

**Atmosphere:** The plane, usually a haven of controlled comfort with its plush seats, soft lighting, and the hum of the engines, has become a pressure cooker of anxiety. The carefully curated atmosphere of calm and efficiency has shattered, replaced by a palpable sense of unease and mounting fear. The scent of recycled air and lukewarm coffee is now tinged with the sharp, metallic tang of adrenaline.
