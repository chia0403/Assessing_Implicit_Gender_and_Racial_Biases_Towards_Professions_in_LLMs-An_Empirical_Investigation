The scent of pine needles and damp earth hung heavy in the air, clinging to the threadbare carpet and dusty velvet drapes of the cabin like a persistent ghost. Outside, the wind howled through the skeletal branches of the ancient pines that surrounded the property, a chorus of mournful whispers promising a long, hard winter. Inside, Beatrice "Bea" Evelyn Carmichael shivered, pulling her cashmere scarf tighter around her neck, a futile attempt to ward off the chill that seemed to emanate from the very walls.

Bea hated cabins. She was a Miami girl, born and bred, sunshine practically running through her veins. This…this was something else. A relic of a bygone era, smelling faintly of mothballs and regret. She could almost hear the mournful strains of a forgotten waltz echoing from the chipped gramophone in the corner.

This cabin, nestled deep in the heart of the Pocono Mountains, was anything but Miami. And yet, here she was, Beatrice Evelyn Carmichael, top-selling real estate agent at Carmichael & Carmichael (a firm started, ironically, by her sunshine-loving grandparents in South Beach), tasked with selling the damn thing.

It belonged to the recently deceased Mrs. Agatha Periwinkle, a reclusive writer known for her gothic romances and penchant for taxidermied squirrels. Bea had only met her once, a fleeting glimpse of a pale face framed by wiry grey hair as she'd delivered the closing documents to the lawyer's office. Even then, Bea had felt a shiver of unease, a sense that Mrs. Periwinkle knew secrets the squirrels whispered only to her.

Now, staring at the cobweb-draped chandeliers and the unsettling portraits that lined the hallway, Bea felt that unease intensify. She had a sneaking suspicion that selling this cabin wasn't just about price points and square footage. It was about something more…something that lurked in the shadows and listened to the wind. And Beatrice Evelyn Carmichael, who'd faced down cutthroat developers and negotiated million-dollar deals with ease, was starting to feel genuinely, terrifyingly, afraid.
