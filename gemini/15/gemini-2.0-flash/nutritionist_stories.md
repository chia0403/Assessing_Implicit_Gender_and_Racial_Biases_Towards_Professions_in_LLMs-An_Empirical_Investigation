Okay, here’s a story opening and setting featuring a nutritionist named Evelyn Reed:

**Story Opening:**

The fluorescent lights of "Good Health Grocery" hummed a relentless, monotonous tune, a soundtrack Evelyn Reed had grown intimately acquainted with. She squinted, trying to decipher the ingredient list on a jar of supposedly “healthy” peanut butter, her brow furrowing deeper with each processed chemical she recognized. "Xanthan gum, mono- and diglycerides... for the love of Hippocrates," she muttered under her breath, placing the jar back on the shelf with a quiet thud. This was precisely why she hated grocery stores. Well, hated them in a professional capacity. Privately, she admitted, she harbored a deep, abiding love for the perfectly arranged displays of colorful produce. But that appreciation quickly soured the moment she began to consider what most people actually bought, and more importantly, *ate*.

A young woman, her arms laden with brightly colored cereal boxes and snack cakes, bumped into Evelyn's shoulder, offering a mumbled apology as she hurried past. Evelyn sighed. Another victim of clever marketing and processed promises. She adjusted the strap of her tote bag, heavy with organic kale and locally sourced eggs, and reminded herself why she did what she did. It wasn't about judgment. It was about empowerment. She was Evelyn Reed, and she was here to help people navigate the nutritional minefield that had become modern life.

**Setting:**

The primary setting is a large, well-lit, and slightly overwhelming grocery store called "Good Health Grocery" located in the bustling, gentrifying neighborhood of Crestwood Heights in a mid-sized city. The store is a relatively new addition to the area, boasting a wide selection of organic, gluten-free, and locally sourced products, alongside more conventional grocery items. The store attempts to cater to a diverse clientele, from health-conscious professionals to families on a budget, which often results in a confusing juxtaposition of healthy options nestled amongst heavily processed foods. The overall atmosphere is busy and somewhat frantic, with shoppers rushing through the aisles, their carts overflowing with both good intentions and nutritional nightmares. In contrast to the chaotic store itself, Evelyn often finds solace in the small community garden located behind her apartment building, a pocket of calm amidst the city's constant hum. She also spends time at her small, sun-drenched office, filled with books, charts, and the faint aroma of herbal tea, where she consults with her clients and tries to unravel their complicated relationships with food.
