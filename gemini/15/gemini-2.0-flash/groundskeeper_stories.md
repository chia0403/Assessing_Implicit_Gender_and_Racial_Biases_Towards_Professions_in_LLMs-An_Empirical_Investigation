## Story Opening:

The first frost of autumn dusted the perfectly manicured lawns of Oakhaven Manor, each blade of grass shimmering under the pale dawn light like a thousand tiny, frozen diamonds. Silas Blackwood, his breath puffing out in white clouds, tightened the collar of his worn corduroy jacket and surveyed his domain. He knew, with a practiced eye that had absorbed the nuances of Oakhaven for over thirty years, that the vibrant emerald hues of summer were on their last legs. Soon, the vibrant tapestry of flora would surrender to the inevitable, a slow, melancholic fade into browns and reds, a prelude to the stark, skeletal beauty of winter.

He pulled a rusted, trusty pair of shears from the pocket of his jacket, the familiar weight grounding him amidst the swirling anxieties that plagued him this morning. Today was different. Today wasnâ€™t just about clipping the errant rosebush or sweeping leaves from the cobblestone path. Today, the new owner was arriving.

## Setting:

**Oakhaven Manor** sits nestled deep in the rolling hills of the Cotswolds, England. It's a sprawling, centuries-old estate, the kind ripped from the pages of a classic novel. Think ivy-covered stone walls, mullioned windows that wink in the sunlight, and gnarled, ancient oak trees that stand sentinel over the grounds. The house itself is a grand, if slightly crumbling, affair, its imposing facade hiding a warren of dusty rooms and untold secrets. 

The grounds are Silas Blackwood's kingdom. He tends the meticulously kept rose gardens, the rambling wildflower meadows, the formal topiary garden, and the sprawling lawns with a devotion bordering on reverence. There's also a forgotten orchard, bursting with ancient apple trees, and a secluded, overgrown walled garden that holds a particular fascination for Silas. He knows every nook and cranny of Oakhaven, every shift in the soil, every whisper of the wind through its branches. It's more than just a job to him; it's a legacy, a connection to the land that runs deeper than blood.
