## Story Opening:

The salt spray stung Jean-Luc Dubois' face as he leaned against the railing of the ferry, the churning waves below mirroring the turmoil in his gut. He inhaled deeply, the scent of brine and seaweed a familiar comfort in this moment of utter chaos. Below deck, the crates of freshly caught langoustines, plump and shimmering silver, were undoubtedly being tossed about like dice in a shaker. He hoped, for the sake of tonight's service, that they'd survive the crossing relatively intact. He needed them. He desperately needed this to work.

His stomach twisted again, not from seasickness, but from the sheer, suffocating pressure of expectation. He’d poured his entire life, his savings, his reputation, into this tiny restaurant on the Isle of Skye. And tonight, the Michelin inspector was coming.

## Setting:

**The Isle of Skye, Scotland, specifically the small village of Elgol.**

The restaurant, "L'Étoile de la Mer" (The Sea Star), is perched precariously on a cliff overlooking Loch Coruisk. It's a small, intimate space, with whitewashed walls adorned with nautical charts and antique copper pans. Large windows offer breathtaking, panoramic views of the loch and the dramatic Cuillin mountains beyond. The decor is a blend of rustic Scottish charm and elegant French simplicity, reflecting Jean-Luc's dual heritage. The air inside, usually thick with the aroma of simmering herbs and roasting seafood, is currently charged with an almost palpable tension. Outside, the wind howls, a constant, mournful song against the jagged coastline.
