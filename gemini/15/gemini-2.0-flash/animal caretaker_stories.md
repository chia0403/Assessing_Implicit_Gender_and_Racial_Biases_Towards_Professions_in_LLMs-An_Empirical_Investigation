Okay, here's a story opening and setting, featuring an animal caretaker named:

**Story Opening:**

The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of wet hay and something vaguely… lemur-ish. Elias Thorne, his own scent profile currently approximating "sweaty and smelling of parrot seed," sighed and wiped his brow with the back of his hand. He’d been wrestling with a particularly stubborn bale of alfalfa for the past hour, and his lower back was starting to stage a protest. Through the mesh of the indoor aviary, the squawks of a dozen rainbow lorikeets sounded like a mocking chorus. He loved his job, he really did, but sometimes, just sometimes, he wondered if he'd been wrong to choose a life surrounded by so much… plumage. The midday sun beat down on the glass roof of the Amazonian exhibit, turning the already humid air inside into a simmering broth. Elias needed to hurry; old Penelope, the elderly sloth, would be expecting her mid-afternoon snack of organic mango slices, and Penelope was not a sloth you wanted to disappoint. She had claws. And a surprisingly expressive glare.

**Setting:**

The story takes place primarily at the **"Emerald Haven Wildlife Sanctuary,"** a sprawling, privately-funded animal sanctuary located in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains in North Carolina. The sanctuary is dedicated to the rescue, rehabilitation, and eventual release (when possible) of injured or orphaned native wildlife, as well as exotic animals that have been confiscated or abandoned.

The Emerald Haven is divided into several specialized sections:

*   **The Native Wildlife Rehabilitation Center:** This area focuses on treating local animals like deer, raccoons, birds of prey, and black bears, with the goal of releasing them back into the wild.
*   **The Exotic Animal Enclosures:** A diverse collection of animals from around the world, housed in carefully designed habitats. This includes the Amazonian exhibit where Elias is introduced, a primate enclosure housing various monkey species, a reptile house, and a large aviary.
*   **The Veterinary Clinic:** A state-of-the-art facility equipped for surgery, diagnostics, and general animal care.
*   **Support Buildings:** Including a kitchen for preparing specialized animal diets, administrative offices, and staff housing.

The setting is both beautiful and demanding. The rolling hills and lush forests surrounding the sanctuary offer a sense of peace and tranquility, but the work is often physically and emotionally challenging. The sanctuary is constantly battling budget constraints and the unpredictable nature of animal care, making it a place where dedication and resilience are essential.
