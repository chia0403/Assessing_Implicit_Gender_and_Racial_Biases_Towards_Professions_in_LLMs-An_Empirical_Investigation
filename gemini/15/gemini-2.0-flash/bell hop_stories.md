The humid Georgia air hung heavy with the scent of magnolias and exhaust fumes as Elijah Theodore Peabody polished the already gleaming brass buttons of his uniform. He hated the smell of exhaust, a harsh counterpoint to the floral sweetness that permeated the air around the Grand Majestic Hotel. He hated, too, the way the humidity plastered his carefully combed hair to his forehead, despite the prodigious amounts of pomade he used.

The Grand Majestic Hotel, a faded belle of Southern hospitality, stood sentinel at the edge of Savannah’s historic district. Its once pristine white façade was now a patchwork of repairs, stained with the years and clinging stubbornly to its former glory. Wrought iron balconies, overflowing with wilting geraniums, dripped with condensation, and the rhythmic creak of the revolving door was a constant, almost mournful, sound.

Inside, the lobby was a cavernous space, cooled (barely) by antique ceiling fans that whirred with the urgency of asthmatic birds. Sunlight, filtered through stained-glass windows depicting scenes from the Civil War (much to Elijah’s chagrin), cast the room in a perpetual twilight. Plush velvet furniture, worn thin in places, offered weary travelers a brief respite, while the incessant clatter of suitcases and the murmur of hushed conversations formed a low, almost hypnotic hum. Elijah, stationed just inside the revolving door, was the first face many saw upon arrival, and he knew the art of a welcoming smile and a practiced, “Welcome to the Grand Majestic, how may I assist you?” He was, after all, Elijah Theodore Peabody, the most dapper bellhop in Savannah, and damn if he wouldn't make sure every guest felt like they were stepping into a time capsule of elegance, even if that capsule was a little bit leaky and in need of a serious paint job. Today, however, the usual practiced smile felt a little…forced. There was something in the air, a nervous undercurrent that tickled his skin like static electricity, and Elijah had a feeling this was going to be one long, unpredictable day.
