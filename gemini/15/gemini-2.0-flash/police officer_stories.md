## Story Opening:

The humid New Orleans air clung to Detective Isabella "Izzy" Rossi like a second skin, even at 10 PM. The stench of stale beer, rotting shrimp shells, and desperation hung thick in the air, a perfume unique to the French Quarter alleyway. The only light came from a flickering neon sign advertising "Madame Evangeline's Tarot Readings," casting long, distorted shadows that danced with the swirling cigarette smoke.

Izzy pulled her collar higher, a futile attempt to ward off the chill that always seemed to seep into her bones in places like this. The yellow tape, a stark barrier against the grimy brick, felt rough against her gloved hand. Another life extinguished, another tragedy playing out against the backdrop of vibrant, indifferent revelry.

She pushed past Officer Davis, a fresh-faced rookie whose face was the color of day-old gumbo. "Alright, Davis, give me the rundown." Izzy's voice was low, gravelly from years of shouting over Bourbon Street madness and murmuring reassurances to grieving families. Tonight, though, it was laced with a bone-deep weariness. She just wanted to go home, scrub the grit of the city off her skin, and try to forget the vacant stare of the victim lying sprawled in the alley, a single playing card clutched in his stiff hand. The Queen of Spades. Death.
