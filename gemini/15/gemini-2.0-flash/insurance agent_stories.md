## Story Opening:

The ringing phone sliced through the otherwise peaceful hum of Mildred Abernathy's afternoon. Outside, a late September sun painted the small town of Harmony Creek in warm, amber light, dappling the leaves of the maples lining Main Street with gold. Mildred, perched behind her cluttered desk at Abernathy & Sons Insurance – a legacy from her grandfather and now solely her responsibility – sighed, pushing her reading glasses up her nose. She was finally making progress on the Henderson claim, a particularly nasty case involving a rogue bull and a prize-winning pumpkin patch.

The phone rang again, its insistent buzz jarring her from the meticulously detailed report. Mildred picked it up, plastering on her most reassuring voice.

"Abernathy & Sons Insurance, Mildred speaking, how can I help you?"

The voice on the other end was thin, reedy, and laced with a panic that made the hair on the back of Mildred's neck stand on end.

"It's...it's the Millicent Manor. Something terrible has happened. I...I think... I think it's haunted."

Mildred closed her eyes. Haunted? Just what she needed. Another claim involving something decidedly *not* covered in any policy she'd ever written.
## Setting:

**Harmony Creek, Pennsylvania:** A quaint, almost aggressively picturesque town nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. It's the kind of place where everyone knows everyone, gossip spreads like wildfire, and the biggest annual event is the Pumpkin Festival. While charming on the surface, Harmony Creek hides its share of secrets, whispered rumors, and forgotten histories.

**Abernathy & Sons Insurance:** Housed in a sturdy, two-story brick building on Main Street. The building itself is a testament to the town's history, having stood for over a hundred years. Inside, the office is a delightful mess of organized chaos. Files overflow from shelves, stacks of papers threaten to topple from the desk, and framed portraits of Mildred's ancestors stare down with varying degrees of disapproval. Sunlight streams in through the large front windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and highlighting the faded glory of a bygone era. The air always smells faintly of old paper, leather, and the comforting scent of Mildred's homemade apple pie, which she often shares with her (few) clients.

**Millicent Manor:** Located just outside of town, perched on a windswept hill overlooking the valley. It's a grand, imposing Victorian mansion, built in the late 1800s by a wealthy industrialist. Now, it's a retirement home, but its history is steeped in tragedy and whispers of madness. Local legends say the original owner's wife went insane and roams the halls, wailing and searching for her lost child. The manor, with its crumbling facade, overgrown gardens, and perpetually darkened windows, exudes an air of undeniable unease.
