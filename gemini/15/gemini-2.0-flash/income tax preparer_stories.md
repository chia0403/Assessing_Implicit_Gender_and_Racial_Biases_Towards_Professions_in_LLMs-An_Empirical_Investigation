## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights of Tax Time Today hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Grace Kensington's life for at least three months out of the year. Today, it was the second week of February, and the hum felt more like a banshee's wail. Outside, the Midwest was performing its annual impression of a frozen tundra, a swirling grey canvas of snow and biting wind. Amelia, however, felt equally frozen inside, staring at the overflowing inbox of scanned documents and forms, each a tiny testament to someone else's financial year, their hopes, their failures, their questionable deductions.

She sighed, the sound lost in the cacophony of clicking keyboards and phone calls in the open-plan office. Amelia smoothed down the already pristine surface of her desk, a futile attempt to impose order on the chaos that threatened to consume her. It wasn't the numbers that bothered her, it was the stories behind them, the silent narratives woven into W-2s and 1099s. Sometimes, she felt like a financial therapist, piecing together the fragments of lives lived through the cold, hard lens of income and expenditure. And today, the weight of it all felt particularly heavy.
## Setting:

**Tax Time Today:** A regional income tax preparation franchise with multiple locations throughout the Midwest. The office is located in a strip mall in the suburban outskirts of a mid-sized city.

**Interior:** A sterile and functional space. The walls are painted a bland shade of beige, and the carpet is a low-pile grey. Cubicles, separated by flimsy partitions, fill the main office area, each equipped with a computer, dual monitors, a telephone, and a mountain of paperwork. A small break room in the back offers a communal coffee pot, a perpetually sticky microwave, and a vending machine stocked with sugary snacks. The air is thick with the scent of cheap coffee and recycled paper.

**Exterior:** The strip mall is a typical example of suburban sprawl, with a sprawling parking lot, a faded facade, and a mix of businesses ranging from a dry cleaner to a nail salon. In winter, the snow drifts high against the buildings, and the wind whips relentlessly through the open spaces. In summer, the parking lot shimmers with heat, and the air is thick with the smell of exhaust fumes and freshly cut grass.
