Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a main character who's a tour guide:

**Story Opening:**

The incessant clang of bicycle bells was already grating on Alistair Finch's nerves, and the morning was barely underway. He adjusted the strap of his worn leather satchel, which, despite its age, still smelled faintly of the sandalwood incense he’d bought on a whim at the market last week. He took a deep breath, trying to summon the boundless enthusiasm required to regale a pack of sunburned tourists with tales of cobbles and canals for the next four hours. He leaned against the ancient, slightly crumbling brick of the Oudekerksplein, the oldest church in Amsterdam, and plastered on his most genuine, welcoming smile.

"Good morning, everyone! And welcome to my 'Hidden Gems of the Red Light District' tour!" Alistair boomed, his voice projecting over the early morning bustle. A few bleary-eyed faces turned his way, clutching maps and bottles of water like lifelines. He mentally braced himself. Today, he prayed, they wouldn't ask *too* many questions about the more…explicit establishments.
**Setting:**

The story opens in the **Oudekerksplein (Old Church Square) in Amsterdam, Netherlands.** It's early morning, around 9:00 AM on a summer's day. The air is thick with the scent of damp cobblestones, freshly baked bread from a nearby bakery, and a faint whiff of something indefinable from the canals – a mixture of algae, history, and perhaps something a little less savory.

The square itself is a fascinating contrast. The towering Oudekerk, with its gothic architecture and weathered stones, stands as a silent witness to centuries of history. Around it swirls a vibrant, chaotic energy. Tourists spill from hotels, delivery vans rumble over the cobblestones, and the murmur of countless languages fills the air. The famous Red Light District, a network of narrow alleys filled with neon-lit windows and a unique atmosphere, edges right up to the square's borders.

The sun is just beginning to break through the clouds, casting long shadows that dance across the ancient facades. The overall feeling is a mix of old-world charm, gritty urban reality, and a hint of something illicit lurking just around the corner.
