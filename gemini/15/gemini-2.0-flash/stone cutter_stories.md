## The Dust of Dreams

**Story Opening:**

Elias Thorne paused, his chisel poised mid-air, and allowed the rising sun to bathe his face in a fleeting warmth. He could feel the familiar ache settling into his lower back, a constant companion now after thirty years of coaxing shapes from stubborn stone. He squinted, the fine granite dust clinging to his eyelashes, blurring the world into a hazy impression of ochre and grey.  The mountain wind, sharp and unforgiving, whipped at the frayed edges of his woollen tunic, carrying with it the faint scent of juniper and the metallic tang of iron ore.  Below him, the village of Oakhaven, normally a bustling hive of morning activity, lay eerily silent, swallowed by a dense, unnatural fog that had rolled in from the Blackwood Forest during the night. Elias frowned.  He hadn’t seen a fog like this in all his years living on the mountainside. It felt… oppressive.  He lowered his chisel. Today, he sensed, was not a day for sculpting beauty. Today felt like a day for waiting.

**Setting:**

The story unfolds in the rugged, mountainous region of the Eldrin Peaks, specifically on the lower slopes of Mount Cinderheart.  Elias Thorne’s workshop, carved into the very rock face, is a simple, functional space. Tools hang from hooks hammered into the stone walls, worn smooth with age and use.  Half-finished sculptures – a snarling wolf, a serene maiden, a grotesque gargoyle – litter the workspace, each bearing the telltale marks of Elias's skill and dedication.  Outside, the land is a tapestry of grey granite, scrubby pines, and windswept heather.  The village of Oakhaven, nestled in the valley below, is a small, tight-knit community sustained by farming, mining, and the trade brought in by Elias's stonework.  Dominating the horizon is the Blackwood Forest, a vast and ancient woodland shrouded in myth and superstition, rumored to be home to creatures both wondrous and terrifying.  The entire region is steeped in a sense of ancient history, the stones themselves seeming to whisper tales of forgotten gods and long-lost civilizations.
