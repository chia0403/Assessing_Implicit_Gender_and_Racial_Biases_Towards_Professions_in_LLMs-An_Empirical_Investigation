The humid air of New Orleans hung heavy in the French Quarter, clinging to everything like Spanish moss. Bourbon Street was a roaring beast of flashing neon, spilled drinks, and desperate laughter, but just a block away, hidden on a quiet side street, sat the dimly lit sanctuary known as "The Serpent's Kiss." It wasn't much to look at from the outside - a faded sign depicting a coiled snake barely visible above a dark oak door - but inside, it was a haven for the weary, the heartbroken, and the occasional tourist who stumbled upon its charm.

Behind the mahogany bar, polished smooth by years of spilled whiskey and confidential whispers, stood **Isabelle "Izzy" Marie Dubois**. She was a study in contrasts: sharp wit softened by a knowing smile, eyes that held the weight of a hundred untold stories, and hands that could coax a perfect Sazerac from the bottle or deliver a withering glare that would silence even the most boisterous drunk. The Serpent's Kiss was her kingdom, and she ruled it with a quiet grace, a dash of cynicism, and an unwavering understanding of the human heart.

Tonight, the rain was drumming a mournful rhythm against the cobblestones outside, and the bar was quiet, save for the low hum of jazz emanating from the antique radio perched on a shelf behind her. Izzy, her dark hair pulled back in a loose braid, polished glasses with a practiced hand, the clinking sound a soothing counterpoint to the melancholic tune. She waited, patient as a predator, for the first lost soul to wander in from the storm, seeking solace in a stiff drink and a sympathetic ear. The night was young, and Izzy knew that in a place like New Orleans, anything could happen.
