The air in Mrs. Eleanor Beatrice Higgins’ classroom smelled perpetually of Elmer’s glue, stale graham crackers, and the faintest whiff of fear. Not fear, exactly, but that low, rumbling hum of uncertainty that clung to the corners like dust bunnies, especially on Mondays. Today, the Monday after Valentine’s Day, that hum was amplified, seasoned with the bittersweet residue of sugary treats and the palpable dread of post-holiday letdown.

Mrs. Higgins, or Mrs. Higgins, Higgins, Higgins, Higgins (as chanted by a particularly energetic group last Tuesday), surveyed her kingdom, a brightly-colored space crammed with construction paper cutouts of hearts, lopsided gingerbread men (leftovers from December, clinging valiantly to the bulletin board), and enough alphabet blocks to spell “banana” at least five times over. Sunlight streamed through the large windows, painting stripes across the worn linoleum floor and illuminating the swirling chaos of mismatched chairs and tiny tables. Outside, the wind rustled the skeletal branches of the oak tree that served as a climbing gym for a squadron of particularly fearless squirrels.

It was 8:47 AM, thirteen minutes before the first wave of parents descended, and Mrs. Higgins, armed with a steaming mug of chamomile tea (Earl Grey was for days when she needed to be invincible, chamomile for days she needed to survive), took a deep breath and prepared for the onslaught. Today, she suspected, the air wouldn’t just smell of glue and graham crackers; it would smell of glitter, too. And Eleanor Beatrice Higgins, a woman whose heart was as big as a school bus and whose patience was, admittedly, sometimes smaller than one of the alphabet blocks, was ready, or at least, as ready as she ever was.
