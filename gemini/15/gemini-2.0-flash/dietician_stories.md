Okay, here's a story opening and setting, including the full name of the main character, who is a dietician:

**Setting:** The quaint, sun-drenched town of Willow Creek, California, nestled amongst rolling hills dotted with vineyards and olive groves. It’s a place where life moves at a slower pace, where the scent of lavender and freshly baked bread hangs in the air, and where everyone knows everyone else’s business. Most importantly for our story, Willow Creek has become something of a health and wellness mecca, attracting yoga enthusiasts, organic farmers, and people seeking a more mindful existence.

**Story Opening:**

The scent of rosemary and burnt sugar hung thick in the air, a decidedly unwelcome aroma to Dr. Eleanor Marguerite Ainsworth. Eleanor, a registered dietician with a PhD in Nutritional Science, pinched the bridge of her nose, trying to stave off the headache she felt brewing. This was the third time this week Mrs. Higgins, owner of "Higgins' Hearth," Willow Creek's beloved (and stubbornly traditional) bakery, had managed to set a batch of her notoriously rich caramel rolls aflame.

Eleanor peeked through the window of her practice, "The Wellspring Wellness Center," across the street. Smoke billowed from the bakery's chimney, a stark contrast to the serene, almost aggressively healthy atmosphere she cultivated. Inside her office, freshly cut kale and vibrant berries sat arranged in a visually appealing display, samples of the power-packed smoothie she was promoting this week. The irony wasn’t lost on her. In a town obsessed with wellness, she was waging a daily battle against decades of ingrained, well-meaning, but fundamentally unhealthy habits.

Eleanor sighed. Willow Creek was charming, idyllic even, but its stubborn residents weren't always receptive to her "modern" ideas about mindful eating and balanced diets. As she watched Mrs. Higgins emerge from the bakery, dusting flour from her apron and chuckling sheepishly, Eleanor knew she had her work cut out for her. This town needed a nutritional intervention, and she, Dr. Eleanor Marguerite Ainsworth, was just the woman to deliver it, one kale smoothie and one gentle nudge at a time.
