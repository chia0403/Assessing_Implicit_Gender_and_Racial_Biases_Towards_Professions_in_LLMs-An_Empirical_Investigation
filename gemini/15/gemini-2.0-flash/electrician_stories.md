The sharp tang of ozone hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Silas Blackwood. He wrinkled his nose, pulling his work gloves a little higher on his wrists as he surveyed the sprawling mess before him. Exposed wires, like metallic spaghetti, spilled from a half-demolished wall, illuminated by the weak beam of his headlamp. Silas was deep inside the crumbling husk of the old Blackwood Manor, the very estate he’d grown up hearing ghost stories about, and the irony wasn't lost on him.

Blackwood Manor wasn't just old; it was ancient. Three generations of Blackwoods had lived, loved, and likely gone mad within its granite walls. Built in the late 18th century, it sprawled across a windswept hill overlooking the jagged Maine coastline. The current owner, a distant cousin Silas barely remembered, had finally decided to sell after years of neglect. The new owners, a pair of eccentric filmmakers, had hired Silas to rewire the entire place, hoping to bring it kicking and screaming into the 21st century.

The main section of the manor had been challenging enough, with its warped floorboards, crumbling plaster, and a labyrinth of ancient wiring that looked like it had been installed by a drunken spider. But this… this was the east wing. Long abandoned, it was shrouded in an unnerving silence even the wind seemed to avoid. Dust motes danced in the stagnant air, illuminated by Silas’s headlamp, creating an ethereal, almost unsettling glow. He felt a prickle on the back of his neck, a sensation that had nothing to do with the voltage humming somewhere deep within the walls. Blackwood Manor was a house of secrets, and this wing felt like it was guarding the darkest ones of all.
