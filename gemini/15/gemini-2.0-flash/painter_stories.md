The Parisian rain was relentless, a weeping curtain blurring the already hazy dawn. Isabelle Claire Moreau, her fingers stained ochre and crimson even in the dim light, huddled deeper into the threadbare shawl that smelled faintly of turpentine and despair. Her tiny attic studio, a pigeon coop repurposed with optimistic charm and crippling drafts, offered little respite from the chill. The leaded glass window, her only source of natural light, was currently a canvas of swirling greys. Down below, the cobblestone street breathed with the city’s awakening, a cacophony of clattering hooves, early morning vendors hawking their wares, and the rumble of garbage carts. Isabelle knew the smells would soon follow – the pungent aroma of freshly baked bread battling with the acrid tang of coal smoke, a constant reminder of the beautiful, brutal city that held her captive and fueled her art in equal measure. Today, however, even the romance of Paris felt distant, lost in the grey wash of the unending downpour. She needed to paint, truly needed to, but inspiration felt as damp and elusive as the early morning fog.
