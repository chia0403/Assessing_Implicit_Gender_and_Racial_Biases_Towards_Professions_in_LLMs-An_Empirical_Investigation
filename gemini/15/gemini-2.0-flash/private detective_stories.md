## Story Opening:

The stale scent of desperation hung thicker than the cigarette smoke in Reginald "Reg" Barrington’s tiny office. Rain lashed against the grimy window, mimicking the relentless pounding headache that had taken up residence behind his eyes. He hadn't slept properly in three days, fueled only by lukewarm coffee and the bitter taste of disappointment. Another client, another dead end. Another bounced check.

Across the cramped room, the ancient rotary phone on his desk rang, its insistent jangle slicing through the gloom like a rusty knife. Reg sighed, pushing himself away from the cluttered desk piled high with unanswered bills and cold case files. He picked up the receiver, the Bakelite cold against his clammy palm.

"Barrington Investigations," he rasped, his voice thick with exhaustion.

A hesitant voice, laced with anxiety, crackled through the line. "Mr. Barrington? Reginald Barrington? I… I need your help."

Reg straightened slightly, a flicker of something akin to hope igniting within him. "I'm listening," he said, the words barely a whisper. Maybe, just maybe, this would be the case to pull him out of the abyss.

## Setting:

The scene is set in **downtown Chicago, 1948**. Reginald Barrington's office, Barrington Investigations, is located on the fourth floor of a dilapidated brick building on the edge of the Near North Side. The building itself is a testament to forgotten grandeur, its ornate façade crumbling under years of neglect.

Reg's office is small, a single room crammed with mismatched furniture. A chipped, mahogany desk dominates the space, buried under stacks of paperwork, cigarette butts, and coffee stains. Two threadbare armchairs, relics from a bygone era, sit facing the desk, their springs groaning under the slightest weight. A stained Oriental rug barely covers the creaking floorboards. The walls are painted a dull, nicotine-stained beige, adorned with faded photographs of past cases - most of which ended less than spectacularly. A flickering neon sign outside the window, advertising "Lucky Strike" cigarettes, casts an eerie glow on the scene whenever it manages to sputter to life, briefly illuminating the room before plunging it back into shadow. The overall impression is one of faded glory, a reflection of Reg himself, a once-promising detective slowly succumbing to the harsh realities of a city steeped in corruption and despair.
