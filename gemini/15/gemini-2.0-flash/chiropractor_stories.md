## Story Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

Dr. Alistair Bertram Finch stared at the x-ray plastered against the illuminated screen. The harsh fluorescent light glinted off his meticulously maintained glasses and cast long shadows on the patient report clutched in his gloved hand. It wasn't the usual slump of desk workers or the pinched posture of weekend warriors he was seeing. This was something...deeper. A subtle shift in the curvature, a whisper of bone whispering of trauma he couldn’t quite decipher. He tapped the image with a pen, the click echoing in the sterile silence. "Interesting," he murmured to himself, a habit that often unnerved his patients. "Very interesting indeed." He just hoped his next patient, Mrs. Higgins and her perpetually problematic hip, wouldn’t be too put out by the delay. This x-ray, and the unseen story it held, was taking precedence.

**Setting:**

Dr. Alistair Bertram Finch's chiropractic practice, "Finch Fine Adjustments," was nestled in the heart of the quaint, and often overly-dramatic, seaside town of Port Blossom, Maine. His office occupied the second floor of a charming Victorian building overlooking the bustling harbor. Sunlight streamed through the large bay windows, illuminating the polished oak floors and the comfortable, if slightly outdated, waiting area filled with nautical-themed artwork and stacks of well-worn copies of *National Geographic*. The air was usually scented with a calming blend of lavender essential oil and the faint, underlying tang of the sea, a carefully curated atmosphere designed to soothe even the most anxious patients. Beyond the waiting area lay his examination rooms, each impeccably clean and organized, a stark contrast to the often chaotic lives of the people who sought his help. Alistair prided himself on providing not just physical relief, but also a sanctuary from the relentless churn of daily life. A sanctuary that, today, felt decidedly...off.
