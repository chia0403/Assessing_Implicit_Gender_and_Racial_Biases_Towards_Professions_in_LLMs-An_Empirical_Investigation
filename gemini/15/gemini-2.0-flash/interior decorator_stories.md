Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a story about an interior decorator, including their full name:

**Setting:**

The grand foyer of the Beaumont Mansion, nestled high on a bluff overlooking the Pacific Ocean in Malibu, California. Sunlight streamed through the arched windows, illuminating swirling dust motes dancing above the polished marble floor. The air, thick with the salty tang of the sea and the faint, lingering scent of lilies (courtesy of the previous decorator's farewell arrangement), did little to mask the palpable sense of neglect that clung to the space like a cobweb. A chipped cherub perched precariously on the edge of a vast, ornately framed mirror, its expression mirroring the mansion's own faded glory.
**Story Opening:**

Annabeth Clementine Hawthorne took a deep breath, the ocean air doing little to calm the flutter of anxiety in her chest. The Beaumont Mansion. Her biggest job yet, and potentially her last if she screwed it up. The scale of the foyer alone was daunting – a cavernous expanse of forgotten elegance. Her heels clicked softly on the marble as she walked further in, her eyes scanning the peeling wallpaper, the threadbare remnants of what had once been a magnificent Aubusson carpet, and the general air of…abandonment. It was a beautiful bones, no doubt, but the Beaumont's had clearly lost interest.

"Well," she murmured to herself, adjusting the strap of her worn leather satchel, a repository of color swatches and design sketches. "Let's see what we can do about that."
