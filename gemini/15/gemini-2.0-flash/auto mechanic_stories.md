The screech of metal against metal, followed by a frustrated grunt, echoed through the cavernous garage. Wrenches, oily rags, and half-disemboweled engines littered the concrete floor. Sunlight streamed through the grimy windows of "Mac's Garage," illuminating motes of dust dancing in the air, a gritty ballet performed to the tune of sputtering generators and the rhythmic clang of hammers.

Evie had inherited Mac's Garage from her grandfather, a gruff but beloved man whose knowledge of cars was almost mystical. He'd passed down more than just the business; he'd instilled in her a passion for the mechanics, for the intricate dance of pistons and valves, for the rumble of a perfectly tuned engine.

But right now, that passion was being tested by a bolt that refused to budge, and the promise of a paying customer tapping his foot impatiently in the waiting room.
