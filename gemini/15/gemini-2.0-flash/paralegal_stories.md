## Opening:

The flickering fluorescent lights of the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, buzzed a monotonous tune that threatened to drill directly into Evelyn Beatrice Finch's skull. She pinched the bridge of her nose, the scent of cheap coffee and desperation clinging to her fingertips. The air hung thick with humidity and the unspoken tension that always permeated these hallowed halls. Evelyn hated Mondays.

Evelyn took another sip of her lukewarm brew, the bitter liquid doing little to soothe the churning anxiety in her stomach. Today was the day. The day Judge Mallory, a woman rumored to have a heart carved from granite and a temperament to match, would rule on the motion to dismiss in the Martinez case. A case Evelyn had spent the last six months meticulously dissecting, researching, and organizing. A case that rested, fragile and delicate as a newborn bird, on the strength of her arguments.

She glanced at the clock on the wall: 9:57 AM. Three more minutes. Three more minutes to try and quell the rising panic threatening to choke her. Three more minutes to remember all the reasons she believed in this case, in the rightness of their client, and in the unwavering dedication of her boss, Mr. David Thornton, to justice. Three more minutes.

## Setting:

The opening takes place within the **Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles**. More specifically, it's a **waiting area** just outside one of the courtrooms. The aesthetic is sterile and impersonal:

*   **Fluorescent lighting** casts a harsh, unflattering glow on everything.
*   **Walls** are painted a neutral, institutional beige, likely chipped and scuffed in places.
*   **Chairs** are uncomfortable, molded plastic or worn vinyl, bolted to the floor.
*   **Bulletin boards** are cluttered with notices, announcements, and outdated legal paperwork.
*   The overall atmosphere is one of **anxiety, anticipation, and simmering tension**. Lawyers, paralegals, plaintiffs, defendants, and witnesses all mingle, each carrying their own burdens and fears. The air is heavy with the weight of legal proceedings and the potential for life-altering decisions. There is likely a small, beat-up **water cooler** gurgling quietly in the corner and maybe a few tired-looking **potted plants** struggling to survive in the artificial environment.
