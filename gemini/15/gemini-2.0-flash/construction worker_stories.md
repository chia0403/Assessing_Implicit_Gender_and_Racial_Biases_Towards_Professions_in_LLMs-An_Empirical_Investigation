The rasp of metal against metal, a high-pitched shriek that cut through the morning hum of the city, echoed in the belly of the unfinished skyscraper. Sweat beaded on the brow of Arthur "Art" Bartholomew Finch, construction worker, as he wrestled with the balky rebar. The November wind, biting and unforgiving, whipped around the exposed skeletal frame of the building, whistling through the gaps where walls would soon stand. Art swore under his breath, the expletive lost to the rising crescendo of power drills and shouted commands.

The setting was the 47th floor of the "Zenith Tower," a project promising to redefine the downtown skyline of New Eden City. This burgeoning metropolis, choked with traffic and ambition, clung precariously to the edge of the Atlantic, its salt-laced air carrying the scent of the sea mingled with the dust and fumes of progress. Below, the city sprawled, a chaotic tapestry of concrete canyons and shimmering glass towers, a testament to the relentless human drive to build, to climb, to reach for the sky. Art, perched precariously on the edge of this raw ambition, felt the familiar thrill of vertigo mixed with a deep, abiding satisfaction. He was building something. He was *creating*. And despite the bone-chilling wind and the deafening noise, he wouldn't trade it for anything. Today, however, something felt different. A prickling unease, a sense of being watched, settled on his skin, as cold and sharp as the November wind.
