## Story Opening and Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The morning dew clung to the emerald blades of Kentucky Bluegrass, each drop reflecting the pale dawn like a tiny, imperfect mirror. Arthur Benedict Fitzwilliam, more commonly known as Arthur Fitz to the residents of Oak Ridge, wiped the sleep from his eyes and stretched, his joints popping a symphony of protest. The air, crisp and carrying the earthy scent of freshly turned soil, invigorated him despite the early hour. He knew the dew meant good things for the hydrangeas he'd planted only yesterday, but it also meant a slick start for his rusty, beloved, and notoriously temperamental Ford F-150, lovingly nicknamed 'Betsy.' Today was the day he tackled the infamous Johnson estate - a sprawling, overgrown jungle that had swallowed the dreams of lesser landscapers whole. Arthur took a deep breath, the challenge a heady mix of daunting and exhilarating. He popped open the cab of Betsy, the hinges groaning in agreement with his own aches, and hoped this Johnson job wouldn't swallow him whole too.

**Setting:**

The story begins in the sleepy, upscale town of Oak Ridge, nestled in the rolling hills of western Connecticut. Think manicured lawns bordering stately colonial houses, where garden clubs are fierce and curb appeal is king. Arthur Fitzwilliam's modest, slightly ramshackle cottage, overflowing with potted herbs and overflowing with tools, sits just outside the town center. The town boasts a charming Main Street with locally-owned boutiques, antique shops, and a single, perpetually-crowded coffee shop. The Johnson estate, the immediate focus of the story, lies on the outskirts of Oak Ridge, shrouded in mystery and bordered by dense woods. It's a gothic Victorian mansion, once a symbol of opulence, now crumbling under a blanket of ivy and neglect. The estate's grounds are a chaotic wilderness, where overgrown rose bushes tangle with forgotten sculptures, and the remnants of meticulously designed gardens are swallowed by creeping vines. The setting is a stark contrast between the curated perfection of Oak Ridge and the wild, untamed beauty (and potential danger) lurking within the Johnson estate.
