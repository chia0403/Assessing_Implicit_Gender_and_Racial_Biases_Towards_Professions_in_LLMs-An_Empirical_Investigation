Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a highway worker:

**Setting:**

The endless, sun-baked asphalt of Highway 395 stretches like a black ribbon across the high desert of eastern California. It's a desolate landscape of sagebrush and granite boulders, punctuated by the occasional Joshua tree that looks like it’s lost its way. The air is dry, crisp, and carries the faint scent of pine from the distant Sierra Nevada mountains to the west. The sun beats down relentlessly, even in the early hours of the morning, turning the highway into a shimmering mirage in the distance. There's a small, weathered maintenance yard a few miles south of Big Pine, marked by a chain-link fence, a couple of faded orange pickup trucks, and a lone, dusty trailer that serves as the office.

**Opening:**

The first rays of sun, a fiery orange knife, sliced through the morning haze as *Mildred "Millie" Alcott* slammed the hood of her battered Ford F-250. She wiped a streak of grease from her forehead with the back of her glove, leaving a smudge that looked like a warrior’s warpaint. "Damn thing," she muttered, kicking a tire. Millie had been battling this truck, affectionately nicknamed "The Mule," for the better part of a week, and it was starting to feel personal. Today, the engine was protesting the early start with a wheezing cough that sounded suspiciously like it was mocking her. She glanced over at the eastern horizon, at the promise of another scorching day on the 395. Time to earn her keep. Time to fight the good fight against the forces of erosion, reckless drivers, and the endless demands of the highway. Time for coffee.
