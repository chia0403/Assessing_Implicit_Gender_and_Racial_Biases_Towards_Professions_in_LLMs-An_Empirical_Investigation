The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, stinging Amelia Rose Harding’s cheeks as she hurried down Navy Pier. Gray, swollen clouds hung low, threatening a fresh dumping of Chicago snow. Amelia clutched her scarf tighter, its wool doing little to combat the damp chill that seeped into her bones. She hated winter, but a good story waited, and a good story was the only thing that could drag her out from under a duvet this side of March.

Amelia Rose Harding, Investigative Reporter for the Chicago Clarion, had been chasing whispers for weeks - rumors of a clandestine meeting taking place tonight, somewhere on the Pier. Whispers about corrupt city officials, shady developers, and deals that would leave the Windy City even more crooked than Al Capone ever dreamed. She’d followed breadcrumbs of leaked emails, overheard conversations in dimly lit bars, and even resorted to dumpster diving (a particularly low point, even for a reporter known for her grit). 

Tonight, she hoped it would all pay off. The text message she'd received earlier, brief and anonymous, promised confirmation of her suspicions, but only if she was brave enough to find it. The message had simply read: *Carousel. 9 PM. Seek the brass horse.*

Amelia scanned the bustling crowds, tourists braving the cold, couples bundled in matching scarves, street performers juggling flaming torches (which looked decidedly more appealing than her current task). She spotted the unmistakable silhouette of the Pier Park Ferris wheel against the bleak sky, and next to it, the glittering, spinning carousel. It was almost 8:50 PM. Time to find her brass horse.
