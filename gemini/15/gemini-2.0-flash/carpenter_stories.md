## Story Opening:

The splinter bit deep. Elias Thorne, a curse already forming on his lips, sucked at the wound, the metallic tang of blood mixing with the sawdust coating his tongue. Another Monday. Another morning ruined by a particularly stubborn piece of oak and his own inherent clumsiness. Elias spat onto the already dusty floor of his workshop, the rhythmic rasp of a saw coming from the back, where his apprentice, young Thomas, was diligently finishing a set of chair legs. He really ought to have been wearing his gloves, he knew, but Elias hated the way they felt, thick and clumsy between his fingers, hindering the delicate dance he performed with the wood. Besides, calloused hands were a carpenter's badge of honor, weren't they? Even if they did throb perpetually and occasionally bleed. He sighed, pushing himself up from the low stool. Time to get back to it. Mrs. Gable wanted her new porch swing installed by Friday.

## Setting:

Elias Thorne's workshop was a sanctuary of controlled chaos. Located just outside the bustling market square of Oakhaven, a small, picturesque village nestled in the foothills of the Willow Mountains, the building itself was a testament to his craft. Its weathered cedar siding, hand-planed and fitted with painstaking precision, hinted at the artistry within. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of freshly cut wood, linseed oil, and the faintest whisper of pine. Sunlight streamed through the large, north-facing window, illuminating swirling clouds of dust motes dancing in the air.

Tools lined the walls, each hanging in its designated place, a testament to Elias's methodical nature. Chisels gleamed, saws hung sharp and ready, and a well-worn workbench stood in the center of the room, scarred with years of use and countless projects. Half-finished cabinets leaned against one wall, waiting for their doors, while stacks of lumber – oak, cherry, and walnut – occupied the opposite side. In the back corner, near the forge, lay a haphazard collection of metal fittings and hardware, a reminder that even the best-laid wooden plans sometimes required a touch of iron. The overall effect was one of organized disarray, a working space brimming with life and the promise of creation. This was where Elias felt most alive, surrounded by the raw materials he transformed into objects of beauty and utility, objects that would outlive him and carry his mark into the future.
