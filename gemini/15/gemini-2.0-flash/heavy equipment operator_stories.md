The air hung thick and heavy, a humid blanket clinging to everything in Harmony, Texas. Even at 6:00 AM, the sun already promised a scorcher. Roscoe "Big Ros" Thompson, his brow already glistening under his faded John Deere cap, spit a stream of tobacco juice into the dusty earth. He watched the heat shimmer off the skeletal frame of what would soon be the Harmony Creek Reservoir, a project that was both his livelihood and the town's last hope.

Harmony Creek wasn't much these days: a dusty main street boasting a gas station, a diner that served lukewarm coffee and even colder gossip, and a handful of houses clinging desperately to the fringes. The creek, once a lifeblood, had dwindled to a muddy trickle, choked by years of drought and neglect. This reservoir, funded by some grant nobody quite understood, was supposed to bring Harmony back from the brink.

Roscoe, a man built like a granite monument with hands that could crush a beer can and yet handle the delicate levers of his bulldozer with surprising grace, felt the weight of that hope squarely on his broad shoulders. He adjusted the brim of his cap, the faded green a testament to years of sun and sweat, and walked towards his pride and joy â€“ a hulking Caterpillar D11T, affectionately nicknamed "The Beast." Its yellow paint was chipped and scarred, a roadmap of the countless jobs it had tackled across the Texas landscape, but Roscoe kept her running smooth and strong. Today, they were carving out the heart of the reservoir bed, pushing tons of earth to create a dam that would, God willing, bring water and life back to Harmony.
