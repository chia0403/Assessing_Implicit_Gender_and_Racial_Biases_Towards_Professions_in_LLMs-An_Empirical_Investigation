The harsh fluorescent lights of the Quick Stop Mart hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the late-night desperation that clung to the air like stale cigarette smoke. Outside, the asphalt shimmered under a weak streetlamp, promising only more of the same relentless humidity that plagued Meadow Creek, Alabama, every summer. Inside, behind the scarred and sticky counter, Eleanor Mae Johnson sighed.

Eleanor hated the hum, hated the smell of microwaved burritos and desperation, and hated the feeling of being stuck. She swiveled on her rickety stool, attempting to ease the ache in her lower back, and glanced at the clock above the cigarette rack: 2:17 AM. Only another four hours and forty-three minutes until she could escape.

Tonight, like most nights, was slow. The occasional lost soul drifted in for a six-pack, a pack of smokes, or a lottery ticket clinging to the futile hope of a better life. Eleanor knew the feeling. She picked at a chipped nail painted a faded shade of rose, wondering if sheâ€™d ever manage to save enough for cosmetology school, and dreaming of the day she could trade this purgatory for the sweet, chemical scent of hair dye and the satisfaction of making someone feel beautiful.
