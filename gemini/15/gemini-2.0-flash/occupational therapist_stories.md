## Story Opening & Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The scent of industrial-strength cleaner battled a losing war against the lingering aroma of stale coffee and despair in the air. Eleanor Rose Callahan sighed, tightening the elastic band holding her unruly auburn hair back. Three o’clock. Three o’clock meant Mrs. Davison, which in turn meant a battle of wills waged over a sock aid and the stubborn refusal of a seventy-eight-year-old woman to admit defeat to arthritis. Eleanor knew the routine intimately. Mrs. Davison would grumble about "useless contraptions" and accuse Eleanor of treating her like a child. Eleanor would patiently remind her of the benefits of maintaining independence, all while inwardly battling her own weariness. Some days, she felt like less an occupational therapist and more a professional negotiator in the realm of geriatric stubbornness.

**Setting:**

The Maple Ridge Assisted Living Facility, a low-slung brick building nestled in the heart of suburban New Jersey. Despite its name, Maple Ridge boasted nary a maple tree, and its resemblance to a prison was often the subject of dark humor amongst the staff. Inside, the decor was a symphony of muted beige and pastel greens, intended to evoke a sense of calm but often resulting in a feeling of oppressive blandness. The communal areas, like the cramped therapy room Eleanor occupied, were sparsely furnished with generic medical equipment and posters displaying cheerful, yet oddly disturbing, depictions of elderly individuals happily participating in various activities. A persistent hum of the HVAC system provided a constant, low-grade soundtrack to the residents' slow march through their twilight years.
