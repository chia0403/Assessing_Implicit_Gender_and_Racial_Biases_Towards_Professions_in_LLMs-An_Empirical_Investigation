## Opening:

The stale scent of industrial-strength cleaner clung to the air in the waiting room, a smell Dr. Eleanor Vance had come to associate with anxiety, tears, and the quiet desperation that permeated the walls of Maplewood Elementary. Outside, the last leaves of autumn clung stubbornly to the gnarled branches of the oak tree, their fiery hues dimmed by the perpetually overcast sky. Eleanor tapped her pen against the meticulously organized appointment book in her lap, the rhythmic click a counterpoint to the frantic drumming of her own heart. In five minutes, she was scheduled to meet with Mrs. Peterson, a distraught mother convinced her son, little Timmy, was being haunted by a ghost. Again. Eleanor sighed. Just another Tuesday in paradise.

## Setting:

Maplewood Elementary School was a brick monstrosity built in the 1950s, a testament to post-war pragmatism and a complete disregard for aesthetic appeal. The hallways were long and narrow, lined with faded bulletin boards showcasing the school's "character pillar of the month" and student artwork featuring disturbingly cheerful anthropomorphic apples. Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on everything and everyone.

Eleanor's office, tucked away at the end of the guidance counselor wing, was marginally better. She had attempted to inject some warmth into the space with potted plants (most of which were currently battling for survival against neglect and a rogue infestation of aphids), a soft rug patterned with calming blues and greens, and an overstuffed armchair that had seen better days. Still, the institutional feel was inescapable, a constant reminder of the battles fought, the wounds bandaged, and the systemic issues that ran deeper than any quick fix could ever hope to address.
