Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a stock broker as the main character:

**Opening:**

The Bloomberg terminal glowed a sickly, fluorescent green, casting harsh shadows on the meticulously crafted mahogany desk. Arthur Bartholomew Sterling III didn't look up from the flickering numbers, even as his assistant, Brenda, cleared her throat discreetly outside his glass office. He chewed the inside of his cheek, the metallic tang of stress a familiar flavor. The markets were bleeding. A tech darling, Stellaris Innovations, was tanking faster than a lead balloon in a hurricane, and half of Arthur's wealthiest clients had a significant portion of their portfolios invested in it. He had to do something. Now.

**Setting:**

Arthur's office occupied a prime corner on the 47th floor of the Sterling & Vance building, a monument to old money and calculated risk that dominated the lower Manhattan skyline. Floor-to-ceiling windows offered a panoramic view of the city â€“ a glittering, restless beast he both loved and feared. The interior was a curated display of restrained opulence: leather armchairs, a Persian rug underfoot, and carefully chosen abstract art that screamed "sophistication" but said nothing. The overall impression was one of power, stability, and the quiet confidence that came with managing billions of dollars. The desk itself was a fortress of information, holding a bank of monitors displaying stock charts, breaking news, and real-time market data. A half-empty glass of Macallan 18 year sat precariously near the edge, a testament to the increasingly long and nerve-wracking days Arthur had been enduring.
