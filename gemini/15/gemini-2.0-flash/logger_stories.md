## Story Opening:

The biting wind, sharp as a logger's axe, whipped down from the craggy peaks of the Cascades, carrying with it the scent of pine and the promise of snow. Ebenezer "Eben" Silas chewed on a plug of tobacco, spitting a stream of dark juice into the snow-dusted underbrush. The steam from his breath plumed white in the frigid air, momentarily obscuring the sight of the giant Doug Fir he was about to face. It was a titan, its bark thick and creased like the skin of an ancient elephant, and Eben knew it would be a grueling day, even for a man as seasoned as himself. But he also knew that this tree, and others like it, were the lifeblood of the small logging community he called home. He hefted his chainsaw, the cold metal biting into his gloved hands. Today, he wouldn't just be felling a tree. He'd be carving out a future.

## Setting:

The year is 1953. The setting is a remote logging camp nestled deep within the Cascade Mountains of Washington State. The camp, tentatively named "Hemlock Hollow," consists of a collection of roughly-hewn wooden cabins, a mess hall perpetually smelling of coffee and frying bacon, and a small, tin-roofed workshop where axes are sharpened and chainsaws are repaired. The surrounding landscape is a dense, verdant forest dominated by towering Douglas firs, Western hemlocks, and cedars. The air is crisp and clean, carrying the scent of pine and damp earth. The rugged terrain is unforgiving, a constant reminder of the dangerous work and the isolation of life as a logger. In the winter, heavy snow blankets the landscape, making movement difficult and amplifying the dangers. In the summer, the forest buzzes with life, but the threat of wildfires always looms large. Hemlock Hollow is a place where survival depends on grit, teamwork, and a deep respect for the power and beauty of the natural world.
