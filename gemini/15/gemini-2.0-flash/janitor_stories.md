## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The year is 2347. The shimmering, sky-piercing towers of Neo-Kyoto, a city built on genetically modified bamboo stalks and powered by harnessed geothermal energy, hum with a constant, low thrum. Holographic koi swim through the air between buildings, and neon kanji paints the perpetual twilight with vibrant, fleeting advertisements. While the elite glide between sky-gardens in automated pods, the lower levels, where the towers' roots tangle and the geothermal vents hiss, are a maze of cramped apartments, dingy noodle bars, and automated repair shops.

**Opening:**

The synthetic cherry blossom scent, pumped in to mask the acrid tang of geothermal exhaust, did little to soothe Elias Thorne’s throbbing headache. He pressed his gloved hand against the grime-streaked window of the Level 37 filtration plant, watching the endless parade of hover-rickshaws flicker through the smoggy air outside. Another night, another layer of bio-sludge to scrape off the hydroponic nutrient tanks. Elias Thorne, janitor second-class, had seen worse. He’d scrubbed things in this city that would curdle synth-milk.

He sighed, a puff of condensation momentarily obscuring his reflection in the window: a gaunt, world-weary face framed by closely-cropped grey hair. He was too old for this work, really, his joints complaining with every clang of his robotic scrubber unit. But in Neo-Kyoto, age wasn't an excuse for anything, least of all poverty. Not if you wanted to eat. He readjusted the sensor pack on his wrist, its glowing face displaying the filtration plant’s atmospheric integrity readings. All green, as usual. Boring. Just another night cleaning up after the pampered upper-levels.

Suddenly, the rhythmic hum of the machinery stuttered, replaced by a high-pitched whine. The sensor pack flashed red. Elias felt a tremor beneath his worn work boots, and the synthetic cherry blossom scent vanished, replaced by a smell like burning metal and ozone. This wasn't bio-sludge. This was something new. And Elias Thorne had a feeling it wasn't going to be boring at all.
