## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The story opens in the heart of Havenwood, Oregon, nestled deep in the Willamette Valley. Havenwood is a picturesque town known for its towering Douglas firs, the constant whisper of the Siuslaw River carving its way through the valley, and the lingering scent of damp earth and pine needles in the air. The year is 2024, late October, and the first blush of autumn is painting the landscape in shades of crimson and gold. However, a chilling wind is beginning to blow down from the Cascade Mountains, hinting at the harsh winter to come. The local economy relies heavily on the timber industry, but a recent slump in the market has cast a shadow over the community.

**Story Opening:**

The piercing shriek of the Havenwood Volunteer Fire Department alarm tore through the early morning quiet, jolting Captain Eleanor "Ellie" Blake from a fitful sleep. She sat bolt upright in bed, her heart hammering against her ribs. Ellie, a woman built like a brick shithouse with calloused hands and eyes the color of a stormy sky, dragged a hand through her tangled, auburn hair. Outside, the wind howled, rattling the windows of her small, cedar-shingled bungalow â€“ a sound that was becoming increasingly familiar. She had a bad feeling crawling up her spine, the kind she'd learned to trust after ten years on the force. It was a feeling that whispered of more than just a faulty toaster oven or a careless campfire. This felt like something bigger. As she threw on her worn, leather boots, she caught a glimpse of the fire dancing in the hearth, casting long, flickering shadows on the walls. A grim thought crossed her mind: this time, the fire might not be so easily contained.
