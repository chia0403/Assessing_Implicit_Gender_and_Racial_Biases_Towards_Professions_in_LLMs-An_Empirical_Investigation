## Story Opening:

The bell above the door jingled a tinny, almost mournful tune, a sound Edgar Mallory had heard thousands of times in his thirty years running "Edgar's Fine Cuts" in the heart of Oakhaven. He didn't bother to look up from the newspaper he was idly scanning. He knew the afternoon lull intimately. The lunch rush was long gone, the after-work clientele still hours away. He could almost smell the quiet boredom hanging heavy in the air, a mixture of old leather, bay rum, and the faint, lingering scent of shaving cream. He flipped the page, past a local news article lamenting the closing of the town's beloved bakery, and sighed. Oakhaven was shrinking, fading like the faded pictures of old baseball teams adorning his shop's walls.

Then, he heard it. A soft cough. A hesitant shuffle of feet on the worn linoleum. Edgar finally lowered his paper and looked up. Standing just inside the doorway was a woman. Not unusual, he'd trimmed the occasional lady's bangs, straightened a sideburn gone rogue. But this woman was different. She was draped in a long, dark cloak, her face almost entirely obscured by a wide-brimmed hat. Her gloved hands clutched a small, intricately carved wooden box to her chest. 

"Afternoon," Edgar said, his voice a little rougher than usual. He hadn't spoken in nearly an hour. "How can Edgar's Fine Cuts help you today?"

## Setting:

**Edgar's Fine Cuts** occupied a prime spot on Oakhaven's Main Street, though "prime" was a relative term these days. The storefront was narrow, squeezed between Mrs. Higgins' antique shop (currently "under new management" according to the dusty sign in the window) and a pawn shop overflowing with forgotten dreams.

Inside, the shop was a testament to simpler times. Two well-worn barber chairs, upholstered in cracked and faded burgundy leather, sat facing large, antique mirrors framed with intricate carvings. Gleaming silver tools – scissors, razors, combs – lay meticulously arranged on a white-enameled counter beside each chair.

The walls were covered in nostalgic ephemera. Sepia-toned photographs of Oakhaven's past lined one wall: the grand opening of the mill, the Fourth of July parade, the championship-winning high school football team of 1952. Opposite them hung a collection of shaving mugs, each personalized with a different name and occupation, a silent testament to generations of Oakhaven men who had sat in Edgar's chairs.

The air was perpetually thick with the comforting scents of barbershop staples: the astringent tang of witch hazel, the warm sweetness of bay rum aftershave, and the clean, creamy aroma of shaving cream. A vintage brass cash register sat on the counter, a silent guardian of the day's meager earnings. The overall impression was one of quiet dignity, a haven of tradition in a town rapidly losing its identity.
