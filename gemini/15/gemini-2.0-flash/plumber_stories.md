**Story Opening:**

The stale, metallic scent of copper filled Leonard Arthur Finch's nostrils as he wrestled with the stubborn pipe. Perspiration beaded on his forehead, threatening to drip into the murky puddle forming at his feet. “Blast it all, Mildred,” he muttered to the recalcitrant fitting, using the name he’d given to particularly troublesome plumbing. “Why you gotta make my life so difficult on a Tuesday?”

He tightened his grip on the pipe wrench, the worn leather biting into his palm. The pressure he applied caused a groan from the aged fixture, followed by a satisfying *crack*. Leonard breathed a sigh of relief. One down, five hundred more to go, or at least it felt that way.

**Setting:**

The scene unfolded in the subterranean labyrinth beneath the Grand Majestic Hotel, a relic of art deco extravagance nestled in the heart of downtown Evergreena. The air was perpetually damp, the light a sickly yellow emitted from bare bulbs strung precariously overhead. Decades of leaks, drips, and overflowing toilets had left their mark on the concrete floor, staining it with a patchwork of rust, mildew, and unidentifiable grime. Pipes, thick as a man's torso, snaked across the ceiling and walls, a complicated arterial system feeding the opulent suites above. The occasional scurrying sound of unseen creatures and the distant, muffled sounds of partygoers contributed to the unsettling ambiance of the hotel's underbelly. Leonard, in his perpetually stained overalls and trusty cap, was its silent guardian, the man who kept the water flowing and the toilets flushing for the elite clientele who never knew he existed.
