## Story Opening:

The cloying sweetness of death lingered in the air, battling unsuccessfully against the industrial disinfectant. Dr. Eleanor Rhys closed her eyes for a moment, breathing deeply through her mouth, trying to focus. It was a trick sheâ€™d learned years ago, a mental shield against the sensory onslaught of crime scenes. Even after a decade of dissecting the shattered minds of criminals, the tangible reality of their handiwork never got easier.

She opened her eyes, the harsh fluorescent lights of the abandoned warehouse glinting off her wire-rimmed glasses. Before her, a macabre tapestry unfolded: pools of dried blood staining the concrete floor, the air thick with the metallic tang of it, and in the center, a single, crimson-soaked rocking horse, its painted eyes staring blankly at the corrugated iron ceiling. It was a child's toy, grotesquely repurposed.

Eleanor exhaled, the air whistling softly past her teeth. This wasn't just murder; this was theatre. And she, Dr. Eleanor Rhys, was about to become the unwilling audience.

## Setting:

**Location:** An abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of Detroit, Michigan. The building is dilapidated and crumbling, paint peeling from the brick walls and rust eating away at the corrugated iron roof. Broken windows are covered with makeshift plywood boards, letting in slivers of pale sunlight. The surrounding area is a desolate industrial wasteland, filled with abandoned factories and empty lots choked with weeds.

**Time of Year:** Late Autumn. The air is crisp and cold, and the days are growing shorter.

**Atmosphere:** Bleak, desolate, and unsettling. The sense of abandonment permeates the air, adding to the already disturbing nature of the crime scene. The location itself feels like a character in the story, reflecting the darkness and decay at the heart of the crime.
