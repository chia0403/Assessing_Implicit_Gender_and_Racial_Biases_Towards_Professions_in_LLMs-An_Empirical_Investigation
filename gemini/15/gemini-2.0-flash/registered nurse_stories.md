Okay, here's a story opening, including setting and introducing a registered nurse named Eleanor Josephine Vance:

**Setting:** The story opens in the dimly lit, perpetually bustling Emergency Room of St. Jude's Hospital in downtown Detroit, Michigan. It's a Friday night, verging on Saturday, and the air hangs thick with the scent of disinfectant, stale coffee, and the underlying metallic tang of blood. The flickering fluorescent lights hum a monotonous drone, a soundtrack to the controlled chaos unfolding beneath them.

**Opening:**

Eleanor Josephine Vance, RN, expertly tightened the tourniquet on the young man's arm. He was pale, sweating, and his eyes darted frantically around the crowded room. "Just breathe with me, Liam," she said, her voice calm and reassuring, a soothing balm against the screaming sirens and shouting paramedics outside. "Deep breaths. In...and out. You're okay. You're safe."

Liam, barely out of his teens, flinched as Eleanor swabbed the crook of his arm with alcohol. The sterile pad did little to mask the grime and desperation that clung to him like a second skin. Gunshot wound. Another Friday night statistic in Detroit. Eleanor suppressed a sigh. She’d seen too many Liams in her eight years at St. Jude’s.

She expertly inserted the IV needle, a practiced motion that belied the tightening in her chest. It wasn’t the blood or the trauma that bothered her anymore; it was the sheer, relentless repetition of the city's suffering. Tonight, though, something felt different. A prickling unease crawled up her spine, a sense of impending dread that had nothing to do with the usual Friday night madness. As she secured the IV line, her gaze drifted to the double doors of the ER. A new ambulance was pulling up, its lights flashing like a warning beacon in the night. And Eleanor had a feeling tonight was about to get a whole lot worse.
