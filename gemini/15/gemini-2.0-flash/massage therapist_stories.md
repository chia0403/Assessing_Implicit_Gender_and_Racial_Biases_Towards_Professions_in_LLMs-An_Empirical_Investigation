The scent of lavender and peppermint hung heavy in the air, a carefully cultivated aroma designed to soothe even the most tightly wound souls. Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Serenity Now, a cozy little haven nestled on the edge of downtown Asheville, North Carolina. Inside, Eleanor Rose O’Malley, massage therapist extraordinaire, smoothed a crisp, white sheet across her massage table, her movements precise and practiced.

Eleanor glanced at the clock: 2:58 PM. Her next client, Mrs. Abigail Weatherby, was never late. Eleanor knew the woman arrived early on purpose, just to soak in the ambiance, the soft lighting, the gentle murmur of the fountain tucked in the corner. Mrs. Weatherby, a retired history professor with a chronic case of writer’s cramp (ironic, Eleanor always thought), was one of her most loyal clients.

But today, a tremor of unease ran through Eleanor, a prickling on the back of her neck that had nothing to do with the weather. The rain seemed to amplify the silence in the studio, despite the gentle spa music. Outside, the city throbbed with a restless energy, a feeling that something was about to break, and Eleanor couldn't shake the feeling that whatever *it* was, *it* was heading right for her doorstep.
