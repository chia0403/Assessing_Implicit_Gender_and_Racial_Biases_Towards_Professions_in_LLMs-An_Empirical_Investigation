The fluorescent lights of the Grandon Public Library hummed a monotonous song, a soundtrack to the silent ballet of patrons browsing shelves and the rhythmic tap-tap-tapping of keyboards. Eleanor Abigail Fairbanks, Head Librarian, adjusted her glasses and sighed, pushing a stray strand of silver-streaked brown hair behind her ear. It was a Tuesday afternoon, that peculiar lull between the post-lunch rush and the after-school mayhem, and Eleanor, despite the quiet, felt a prickle of unease. The air itself felt thick, charged with something…unusual. The smell of aged paper and beeswax polish, normally comforting, was now almost cloying.

The Grandon Public Library, a Victorian behemoth built in 1888, stood sentinel on the corner of Elm Street and Oak Avenue in the sleepy town of Grandon, Ohio. Its red brick façade was softened by ivy climbing its walls and the sprawling oak tree that sheltered the entrance. Inside, its high ceilings were adorned with intricate plasterwork, and the towering shelves groaned under the weight of centuries of collected knowledge. Stained glass windows depicting scenes from classic literature cast rainbow-hued shadows across the polished wooden floors. It was a place steeped in history, a place where the whispers of forgotten stories lingered in the air. And today, those whispers felt louder, more insistent, than ever before.
