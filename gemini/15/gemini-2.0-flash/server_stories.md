## Story Opening:

The clatter of cutlery against porcelain was a soundtrack as familiar and comforting to Agnes Beatrice Plumtree as the gentle hum of her grandmother's sewing machine. Tonight, however, the symphony of fine dining felt more like a discordant cacophony. Agnes, a server at the esteemed "Le Coq D'Or" restaurant in the heart of Chicago's Gold Coast, navigated the crowded tables with practiced ease, a smile plastered on her face that felt less like a genuine expression of hospitality and more like a carefully constructed mask.

She refilled the water glasses at table six, her movements precise and efficient. Mr. and Mrs. Vandergelt, their faces lit by the flickering candlelight, were deep in a conversation, presumably about stocks or yachts or whatever else kept the city's elite occupied. Agnes barely registered their words, her mind already racing to the next task: delivering the perfectly seared foie gras to table twelve, ensuring the sommelier had poured the correct vintage, and remembering to subtly suggest the crème brûlée for dessert. It was a dance she'd performed hundreds of times, a ballet of silver service and hushed tones. But tonight, Agnes felt a nagging unease, a prickling sensation that something was about to disrupt the polished tranquility of Le Coq D'Or.
## Setting:

**Le Coq D'Or** (The Golden Rooster) is a bastion of old-world elegance nestled within a century-old building in Chicago's Gold Coast neighborhood. The interior is a carefully curated homage to classic French design. Heavy, velvet curtains in deep burgundy drape the tall windows, muffling the city's sounds. Crystal chandeliers cast a warm, golden glow on the meticulously set tables, each adorned with crisp white linens, gleaming silverware, and delicate porcelain plates. Dark, polished wood paneling lines the walls, punctuated by original impressionist paintings. The air is thick with the aroma of butter, herbs, and expensive perfume.

The clientele is a mix of Chicago's elite: socialites draped in designer dresses, power brokers discussing million-dollar deals over escargots, and established families celebrating milestones with generations of silverware. The staff, meticulously trained in the art of fine dining, move with an air of quiet efficiency, their every gesture precise and rehearsed. Le Coq D'Or is a place where appearances are paramount, where every detail is scrutinized, and where the illusion of effortless luxury is maintained at all costs. Behind the scenes, however, a constant hustle and bustle keeps the operation running smoothly, a hidden world of clanging pots, whispered instructions, and simmering tensions.
