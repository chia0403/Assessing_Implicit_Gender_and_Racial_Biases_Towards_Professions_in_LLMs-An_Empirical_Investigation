## Story Opening & Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The fluorescent lights of the hospital hummed a monotonous song, a soundtrack Amelia Grace Hawthorne had grown intimately familiar with over the past decade. She pinched the bridge of her nose, the ghost of a headache throbbing behind her eyes. It was 8:17 PM, and the waiting room was blessedly empty, a stark contrast to the bustling chaos of earlier. The last patient of the day, Mr. Henderson, had finally shuffled off with a slightly less-than-enthusiastic wave and a promise to "try" to do his quad sets. Amelia doubted he would. She ran a hand through her already messy bun, the elastic threatening to snap any second, and sighed. Another day, another battle against stubborn hamstrings and ingrained inactivity. Sometimes, she wondered if she was making any real difference at all.

**Setting:**

The story primarily unfolds within the "Rehabilitation & Recovery Center" of St. Jude's Hospital in Providence, Rhode Island. This particular section of the hospital is tucked away on the second floor, away from the more frantic energy of the Emergency Room and the surgical wards. The color scheme attempts to be cheerful - pale green walls, motivational posters featuring generic stock photos of people hiking and playing tennis - but the overall effect is sterile and somewhat melancholic.

The space consists of:

*   **A main waiting room:** Dominated by uncomfortable vinyl chairs, a perpetually sticky coffee table littered with outdated magazines, and a perpetually out-of-order water cooler.
*   **A series of individual treatment rooms:** Each containing a treatment table, various resistance bands and weights, a computer workstation for charting, and a surprising amount of medical tape.
*   **A larger gym area:** Equipped with treadmills, stationary bikes, parallel bars, and a variety of specialized rehabilitation equipment designed to help patients regain mobility and strength after injuries, surgeries, or strokes.

Outside the center, the story occasionally touches upon Amelia's life in her cozy, book-filled apartment in the East Side of Providence, and the occasional visits to the local coffee shop where she nurses a latte and tries to forget about the endless parade of aches and pains. The autumnal charm of Providence, with its changing leaves and crisp air, provides a contrasting backdrop to the often-grim realities of the hospital.
