## Opening:

The rhythmic snick of shears, a sound that was as comforting to Alistair Finch as his own heartbeat, echoed through the silent workshop. He paused, his fingers hovering over a length of rich, emerald velvet, the scent of lanolin and beeswax clinging to the air around him. Outside, the incessant drumming of rain against the leaded windows of his shop threatened to drown out even the delicate music of his craft. A sigh, as soft as the rustle of silk, escaped Alistair's lips. Another tempest. Another night likely spent alone, stitching away at the whims of the gentry, while the wind howled a mournful tune just outside his door. He glanced at the half-finished waistcoat, a commission for a foppish young lord, and the familiar knot of dissatisfaction tightened in his stomach. Was this all there was? Precision, perfect stitches, and a life lived in the muted colours of his fabrics? He longed for something more, something bolder than the subtle embellishments he meticulously crafted.

## Setting:

Alistair Finch's bespoke tailoring shop, "Finch & Needle, Purveyors of Fine Cloth," nestled on the cobbled, rain-slicked street of Elderwood, a town renowned for its dense, ancient forest and the secrets it kept. The shop itself was a small, two-story building, its age evident in the leaning timbers and the ivy that clung tenaciously to the weathered stone facade. Inside, the ground floor was a haven of textile luxury. Shelves overflowed with rolls of fabrics – velvet, wool, silk, linen, each in a dizzying array of colours and patterns. A long, oak cutting table dominated the centre of the room, littered with sketches, patterns, and half-finished garments. Bolts of thread in every conceivable hue lined the walls, catching the light from the gas lamps in a shimmering rainbow. The air was thick with the comforting scents of beeswax polish, pressed linens, and the faint, earthy aroma of the surrounding forest, which often found its way inside on the boots of his customers. A narrow, winding staircase led to the upper floor, which housed Alistair's living quarters – a small, cluttered space filled with books, half-written poems, and a view of the perpetually grey skies over Elderwood.
