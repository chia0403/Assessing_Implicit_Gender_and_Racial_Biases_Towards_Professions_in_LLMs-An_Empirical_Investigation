The chipped mug, sporting a faded cartoon of a grumpy cat saying "Monday Mood," warmed Evelyn Beatrice Hawthorne's hands, but did little to thaw the ice that had settled in her soul. Another Monday. Another day of fielding calls for the relentlessly cheerful, yet secretly cutthroat, partners at Sterling & Croft, Attorneys at Law. The opulent lobby, designed to inspire confidence and awe, did nothing but amplify the echo of her own ennui. Gleaming marble floors, polished to a blinding sheen, reflected the harsh fluorescent lights that buzzed subtly overhead. An enormous abstract sculpture, comprised of twisting chrome and vaguely suggestive angles, dominated the space, a constant reminder of the firm's commitment to "cutting edge" legal strategy. Even the air, pumped through a sophisticated ventilation system, smelled vaguely of money and lemon polish. Evelyn sighed, the sound barely audible over the quiet hum of the building. She hated lemon polish. This wasn't the life she envisioned when she'd declared a major in Renaissance Literature. More like Renaissance Rent Collection.
