## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The last rays of a humid summer sun were painting the cobblestone streets of Charleston, South Carolina, in shades of rose and gold. The air, thick with the scent of honeysuckle and pluff mud, hung heavy and still. Across the street, horse-drawn carriages clip-clopped past historic buildings, their riders chattering about dinner plans and evening strolls. Here, on King Street, tucked between a quirky antique shop and a bustling bistro, sat "Bloom & Root," its window display overflowing with lush hydrangeas and cascading bougainvillea.

**Opening:** The bell above the door of Bloom & Root tinkled merrily, announcing the departure of Mrs. Abernathy, a regular with a penchant for pale pink roses. Cordelia Beatrice Hawthorne, her hands stained a vibrant green and her auburn hair pulled back in a messy bun, sighed contentedly. Finally, a moment of peace. She leaned against the cool marble counter, wiping her forehead with the back of her hand. Today had been a whirlwind of wedding bouquets, sympathy arrangements, and last-minute birthday surprises. Cordelia loved the controlled chaos of the flower shop, the way she could mold nature into something beautiful, something that spoke volumes when words failed. But right now, all she wanted was to water the orchids and maybe, just maybe, steal a few moments with the new book she had been eyeing, a collection of forgotten folklore about carnivorous plants. Just as she reached for the watering can, a shadow fell across the doorway, and a man, his face obscured by the dim light, stepped inside.
