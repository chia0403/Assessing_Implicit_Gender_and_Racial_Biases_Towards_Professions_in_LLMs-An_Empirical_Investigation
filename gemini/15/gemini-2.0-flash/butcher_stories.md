The air hung thick with the scent of sawdust, aged meat, and the faint, metallic tang of blood. Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight that pierced the gloom of "O'Malley's Fine Meats," illuminating the practiced hands of Bartholomew Aloysius O'Malley. Bartholomew, a man built like a seasoned oak, with hands calloused and strong, sharpened his cleaver on the worn stone block, the rhythmic rasp a familiar comfort in the pre-dawn stillness. The brick walls of the shop, built in 1923, still bore the faded, almost ghostly advertisement for "O'Malley's Prize Winning Pork" painted high above the counter. 

O'Malley's was nestled deep in the heart of Havenwood, a town clinging precariously to the edge of the Redwood National Park. Generations of O'Malleys had carved and cleaved in this very spot, their lives inextricably linked to the rhythm of the seasons and the needs of the small, tight-knit community. Havenwood was a place where everyone knew everyone, and Bartholomew knew exactly which cuts Mrs. Henderson preferred for her Sunday roast, and which sausage young Timmy Johnson would sneak when he thought no one was looking. Today, however, the air felt different, heavier somehow. Bartholomew sensed it in the twitch of his loyal German Shepherd, Gus, who lay panting nervously by the chopping block, and in the unsettling silence where the usual chorus of morning birds should have been. Something was amiss in Havenwood, and Bartholomew Aloysius O'Malley had a feeling this would be a day unlike any other he had seen behind the butcher's block.
