The aroma of toasted almonds and caramelized sugar hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Beatrice Eleanor Hawthorne. At 5:00 AM, the only other sound competing with the gentle hum of the proofing oven was the rhythmic thud of Beatriceâ€™s bare feet against the worn linoleum floor of "Beatrice's Bakes," her cozy bakery nestled in the heart of Havenwood, Vermont.

Havenwood itself was the kind of town painted on postcards: rolling green hills, a sparkling lake reflecting the sky, and a main street lined with quaint shops boasting hand-crafted wares and locally-sourced produce. The bakery, a converted Victorian house painted a cheerful butter yellow, was no exception. Its windows were filled with a tempting display of perfectly browned croissants, sugared donuts, and intricately decorated cakes, a beacon of sweetness in the early morning gloom. Beatrice, her auburn hair pulled back in a messy bun and dusted with flour, already felt the day pulling her in, a delicious tide of dough, cream, and satisfied customers waiting just beyond the rising sun.
