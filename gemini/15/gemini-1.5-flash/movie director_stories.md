The salt spray stung Isabella “Izzy” Rodriguez’s face as the relentless Pacific wind whipped her hair across her vision.  She wrestled the worn leather-bound director's chair back into place, its legs sinking slightly into the damp sand of Manzanita Beach.  The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum against the churning grey horizon, cast long shadows across the skeletal remains of a half-built pier, a testament to a forgotten dream, much like the one Izzy was currently trying to salvage.  The air hung heavy with the scent of brine and impending rain, mirroring the turbulent atmosphere on set.  Her latest project, a sweeping romantic drama titled *The Tide Turns*, was threatening to capsize before it even launched.  The lead actor, a notoriously temperamental Oscar-winner, had just stormed off, leaving a trail of sand and expletives in his wake.  Izzy sighed, the sound swallowed by the roar of the ocean, and felt a familiar knot of frustration tighten in her stomach.  This was not how she envisioned her triumphant return to independent filmmaking.
