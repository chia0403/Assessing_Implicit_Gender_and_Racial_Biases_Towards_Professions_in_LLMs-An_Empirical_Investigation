The salt spray stung Aurelia Blackwood’s face, a familiar kiss from the unforgiving Atlantic.  She stood perched on the windswept cliffs of Cornwall, the raw, untamed beauty a stark contrast to the delicate watercolour washes she was attempting to capture.  The wind, a relentless sculptor, whipped her auburn hair across her face, threatening to tear the still-damp paper from her makeshift easel – a battered wooden box balanced precariously on a stack of smooth, grey stones. Below, the churning sea gnawed at the cliffs, its relentless rhythm a counterpoint to the frantic strokes of her brush. The air hung thick with the scent of brine and seaweed, a pungent perfume that permeated everything, even the vibrant hues of the sunset bleeding across the stormy sky.  Aurelia, her brow furrowed in concentration, fought to translate the chaotic energy of the scene onto her paper, a battle waged against the elements themselves.
