The wind, a snarling beast with teeth of ice, clawed at Elias Thorne's worn work gloves as he clung to the precipice of the St. Jude's Cathedral spire.  Below, the city of Prague sprawled, a breathtaking panorama of terracotta roofs and cobbled streets glistening under a bruised, twilight sky.  Gargoyles, ancient and grotesque, leered down at him from their perches, silent witnesses to Elias's precarious dance with gravity.  The air, thin and biting at this altitude, carried the faint scent of woodsmoke and melting snow, a peculiar perfume unique to a Prague winter evening.  Elias, a master roofer with calloused hands and eyes the colour of a stormy sea, adjusted his grip on the rusted ironwork, the chill seeping into his bones. Tonight's job was anything but routine; the whispers he'd overheard in the smoky taverns below suggested more than just leaky tiles were at stake.
