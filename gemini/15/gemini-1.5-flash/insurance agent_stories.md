The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia “Mia” Hernandez’s hands, a meager comfort against the bone-chilling November wind rattling the windows of her small, cluttered office.  Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of Hernandez Insurance Services, a rhythmic drumming that somehow amplified the gnawing silence within.  The only illumination came from a single, flickering fluorescent tube overhead, casting long, skeletal shadows across the stacks of files threatening to topple from overflowing shelves.  Outside, the town of Havenwood, nestled deep in the Oregon Coast Range, was shrouded in a thick, grey mist, the kind that seeped into your bones and clung to you like a damp shroud.  The air smelled of pine needles, damp earth, and the faint, metallic tang of saltwater carried on the relentless wind. Mia sighed, the breath misting briefly in the cold air.  Another slow day in Havenwood.  Or so she thought.  The insistent ringing of her ancient telephone shattered the quiet, a jarring sound that promised anything but a routine Tuesday.
