The acrid bite of smoke stung Lieutenant Elias Thorne's eyes, a familiar discomfort that did little to dull the sharp anxiety clawing at his throat.  He coughed, the sound swallowed by the roar of the inferno consuming the old Victorian mansion on Ashwood Lane.  Flames, a malevolent orange and yellow, licked at the gables, their hungry dance reflected in the shattered windowpanes.  The night air, usually crisp and clean in the affluent suburb of Oakhaven, was thick with the smell of burning wood and something elseâ€¦ something sickeningly sweet, like melting plastic.  The crackling of the fire was punctuated by the rhythmic thud of the pump, the desperate cry of the hose, and the strained shouts of his crew battling the blaze from the back.  Elias, positioned on the precarious ladder leaning against the burning west wing, felt the heat radiating from the building like a living thing, a tangible threat against his own mortality.
