Elderwood Farm, passed down through generations of Thornes, felt more like a burden than a legacy tonight.  The ancient farmhouse, a squat stone structure that had weathered centuries of harsh winters, seemed to sigh under the weight of the approaching darkness, its single, flickering lamp a feeble defiance against the encroaching gloom.
