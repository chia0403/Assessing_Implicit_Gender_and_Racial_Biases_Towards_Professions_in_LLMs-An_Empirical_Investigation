The stale scent of sawdust and forgotten dreams clung to the air in the dilapidated theatre, a perfume only Bartholomew "Barty" Finch truly appreciated.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single bare bulb hanging precariously above, danced in the shafts of moonlight filtering through the cracked panes of the stage door.  Barty, his tweed jacket dusted with the same fine powder as the floorboards, traced a finger along the faded gilt lettering spelling out "The Majestic," a name that now seemed cruelly ironic.  The Majestic, once a jewel of the city's theatrical crown, was now little more than a mausoleum, its grandeur decaying like a forgotten queen.  But to Barty, it was home, a canvas waiting for his vision, a stage yearning for life.  Tonight, however, the only sounds were the creaks of settling timbers and the frantic thump-thump-thump of his own restless heart.  His ambitious new production of "Macbeth," a gamble that could either revive his flagging career or bury it beneath a pile of unpaid bills and shattered dreams, was just days away.
