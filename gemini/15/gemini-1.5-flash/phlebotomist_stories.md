The fluorescent lights of the Mercy General Hospital lab hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* of Amelia Katherine “Amy” Holloway’s own heartbeat.  It was a sound she’d become intimately familiar with over the past five years, a constant companion to the prick of needles and the rush of blood flowing into vacutainer tubes.  Tonight, however, the familiar hum felt discordant, a jarring dissonance against the unsettling quiet of the nearly deserted lab.  Rain lashed against the tall windows overlooking the city, mirroring the storm brewing inside Amy.  She hadn't been this on edge since... well, since the incident.  The one she tried so hard to forget, but the echoing silence of the lab tonight, broken only by the relentless drumming of the rain and the occasional sigh of the ancient centrifuge, was bringing it all back.
