The biting wind howled a mournful ballad across the desolate plains of Nebraska, whipping snow into frenzied, swirling dervishes around the cab of "The Wandering Star."  Inside, the heater fought a losing battle against the arctic blast, its feeble whine a counterpoint to the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the eighteen-wheeler's tires.  Steam rose from the coffee cup clutched in the calloused hand of Jedediah "Jed" Stone, its warmth a small comfort against the bone-chilling cold that seeped into the very marrow of his bones.  Jed, a man sculpted by years spent wrestling with unforgiving roads and even more unforgiving weather, squinted at the swirling whiteout through the frost-covered windshield.  His destination: Cheyenne, Wyoming.  His cargo: a load of frozen turkeys, destined for some unsuspecting Thanksgiving table halfway across the country.  But tonight, the journey felt less like a delivery and more like a pilgrimage through the heart of a frozen wasteland.
