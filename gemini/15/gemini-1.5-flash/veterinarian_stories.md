The biting November wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vance's hair across her face as she wrestled the heavy oak door of the Alder Creek Animal Clinic open.  The scent of antiseptic and damp wool hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort in the otherwise desolate landscape.  Alder Creek, nestled deep within the rugged, snow-dusted mountains of Wyoming, was a town where the only sounds louder than the wind were the bleating of sheep and the occasional mournful howl of a coyote.  Eleanor, bundled in layers of fleece and wool, shivered not just from the cold, but from a premonition that this particular Tuesday would be anything but ordinary.  The single flickering lamp above the clinic's sign cast long, skeletal shadows across the freshly fallen snow, painting the scene in a stark, almost melancholic light.
