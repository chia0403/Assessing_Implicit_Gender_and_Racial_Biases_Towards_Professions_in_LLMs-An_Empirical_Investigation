The fluorescent lights of "Quick Stop Mart" hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *beep-beep-beep* of Amelia Grace Hawthorneâ€™s scanner.  Amelia, or Amy as most people called her, meticulously arranged a bag of slightly bruised Granny Smith apples beside a carton of suspiciously-cheap orange juice.  The air hung thick with the cloying sweetness of artificial cherry air freshener and the faint, lingering scent of stale coffee.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the already indistinct neon signs of the strip mall into a hazy, watercolor wash of color. Inside, the only other customer was a man hunched over a lottery ticket, his face illuminated by the sickly glow of the digital display, his breath misting in the chilly air.  Tonight, the Quick Stop Mart felt less like a convenience store and more like a lonely, fluorescent-lit purgatory.
