The biting Antarctic wind howled a mournful symphony around Dr. Aris Thorne, stinging his exposed cheeks despite the thick layers of thermal gear.  His breath plumed out in ghostly white clouds, instantly freezing in the frigid air.  The research station, a squat, snow-dusted behemoth clinging precariously to the ice shelf, seemed to groan under the relentless assault of the elements.  Inside, the warmth was a stark contrast to the brutal exterior, a haven of flickering fluorescent lights, the hum of generators, and the constant, low thrum of scientific equipment.  Aris, however, found little comfort in the sterile environment.  His gaze was fixed on the swirling blizzard outside, a swirling vortex of white that held a secret â€“ a secret he was determined to uncover, even if it meant facing the unforgiving wrath of the Antarctic wilderness.
