The biting November wind whipped Elias Thorne’s already-chapped lips raw as he wrestled the recalcitrant oak branch into submission.  Elias, head groundskeeper of Blackwood Manor, cursed under his breath, the sound swallowed by the mournful sigh of the wind through the skeletal branches of the ancient trees surrounding the sprawling gothic mansion.  Grey skies wept a relentless drizzle, mirroring the melancholic mood that had settled over the estate since Lord Ashworth’s sudden death a month prior.  Blackwood Manor, once a vibrant hub of activity, now stood shrouded in a palpable silence, broken only by the creak of settling timbers and the incessant drumming of rain on the slate roof.  The manicured lawns, Elias's usual pride, were sodden and forlorn, their vibrant greens dulled to a sickly yellow-brown under the relentless onslaught of the autumnal storm. Even the meticulously sculpted hedges seemed to droop with a shared sorrow.
