The salt spray stung Dr. Eleanor Vance's face as she wrestled the stubborn canvas awning of her seaside clinic into submission.  The wind, a relentless, howling banshee off the churning Atlantic, threatened to rip the whole thing from its moorings.  Her small, shingle-style building, perched precariously on the cliff edge overlooking Widow's Cove in the quaint, perpetually mist-shrouded town of Seabrook, seemed to shiver under the onslaught.  Inside, the scent of pine and ozone battled for dominance, a fitting aroma for a practice that specialized in mending broken bodies and weary souls battered by the unforgiving sea.  This was not your average chiropractic clinic; this was a refuge, built on the very edge of the world, both literally and metaphorically.
