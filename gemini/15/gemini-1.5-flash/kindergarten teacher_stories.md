The chipped paint of the "Welcome to Ms. Eleanor Vance's Class!" sign flaked onto the vibrant, slightly sticky, linoleum floor like a miniature, colourful snowfall.  Dust motes, illuminated by the weak morning sun slanting through the grimy classroom window, danced in the air, a silent ballet performed for an audience of abandoned crayons and half-finished finger paintings.  The air itself hummed with the faint, anticipatory energy of a sleeping giant â€“ a giant composed of twenty-five five-year-olds about to awaken.  Ms. Eleanor Vance, however, remained perfectly still, perched on a tiny, plastic chair at her cluttered desk, a steaming mug of lukewarm coffee clutched in her hands, the faint scent of cinnamon battling the stronger aroma of dried playdough.  She was bracing herself.  Today was Show and Tell, and anything could, and usually did, happen.
