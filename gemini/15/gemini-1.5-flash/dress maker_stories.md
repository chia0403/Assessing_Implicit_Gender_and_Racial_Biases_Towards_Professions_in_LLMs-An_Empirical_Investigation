The scent of lavender and old silk hung heavy in the air, a comforting shroud against the biting November wind that rattled the windows of Esme Mallory's atelier.  Rain lashed against the leaded panes, mirroring the frantic rhythm of Esme's needle as she painstakingly stitched a delicate silver thread onto the bodice of a gown.  Her small, cluttered shop, nestled on a cobbled side street in the heart of Prague's Old Town, was a sanctuary of creativity, a chaotic explosion of colour and texture – bolts of velvet and brocade tumbling from overflowing shelves, shimmering silks draped across mannequins, and half-finished creations pinned to every available surface.  Outside, the gothic spires of St. Vitus Cathedral pierced the stormy sky, their silhouettes stark against the swirling grey clouds.  Tonight, however, Esme's focus was entirely on the gown before her – a masterpiece destined for the opera, a shimmering cascade of emerald silk that promised to steal the breath of anyone who dared to gaze upon it.
