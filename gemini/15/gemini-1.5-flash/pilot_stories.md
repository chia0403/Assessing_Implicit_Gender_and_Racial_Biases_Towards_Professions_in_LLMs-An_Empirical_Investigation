The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful song around Captain Evelyn Grace "Evie" Blackwood's battered Cessna 185, its icy breath frosting the already-frozen windshield.  Below, the Chugach Mountains clawed at the bruised twilight sky, their jagged peaks shrouded in a swirling, ethereal mist that clung to them like a spectral shroud.  Evie squinted, the weak light reflecting off the glacial ice scattered across the valleys like fallen stars.  She checked her instruments one last time – the altimeter needle stubbornly clinging to 8,000 feet, the fuel gauge a worryingly close whisper to empty.  This wasn't how she’d envisioned her last flight of the season.  Not by a long shot.
