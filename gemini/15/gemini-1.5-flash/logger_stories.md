The biting wind whipped at Elias Thorneâ€™s thick wool coat, stinging his cheeks with icy needles.  He hunched deeper into his worn parka, the collar scratching against his chapped neck, a familiar discomfort he barely registered anymore.  The air hung heavy with the scent of pine and damp earth, a fragrance both comforting and chilling in equal measure.  Around him, the ancient Douglas firs stood like silent sentinels, their gnarled branches clawing at the bruised, twilight sky.  Elias, a man sculpted by years of backbreaking labor in the unforgiving wilderness of the Cascade Mountains, adjusted the worn leather straps of his axe, the familiar weight a small comfort against the vast, indifferent expanse of the forest.  The last rays of the dying sun cast long, skeletal shadows that danced and writhed amongst the towering trees, transforming the familiar landscape into something both beautiful and menacing.  Tonight, the mountain held its breath.  And Elias Thorne, with it.
