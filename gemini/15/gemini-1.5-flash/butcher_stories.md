The chill wind, thick with the scent of woodsmoke and brine, whipped around Bartholomew "Barty" Butchers' thick wool coat as he hauled a side of beef into his shop.  Barty's Butcher Block, it proclaimed itself in chipped, gold lettering above the door, a statement somewhat undermined by the peeling paint and the precarious stack of firewood leaning against the wall.  The shop itself, nestled on the edge of the windswept moorland town of Oakhaven, was a time capsule of a place; rough-hewn wooden counters, stained dark with years of spilled blood and rendered fat, gleamed dimly under the sputtering gaslight.  The air hung heavy with the familiar aroma of iron, sawdust, and something indefinably earthy, a smell Barty himself had come to associate with home.  Outside, the first snow of winter dusted the bleak landscape, a stark contrast to the warm, almost comforting, crimson spilling from a freshly cut leg of lamb on his counter.
