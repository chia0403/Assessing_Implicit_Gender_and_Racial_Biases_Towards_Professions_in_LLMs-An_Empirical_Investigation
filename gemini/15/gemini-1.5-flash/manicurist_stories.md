The air hung thick with the scent of acetone and lavender, a cloying sweetness that clung to everything in Seraphina “Sera” Dubois’s tiny nail salon, “Polish Perfection.”  Dust motes, illuminated by the harsh fluorescent lights, danced in the afternoon sun that slanted through the grimy windowpanes of her storefront on Bleecker Street.  Sera, perched on her worn, vinyl-covered stool, hummed a jaunty tune off-key, her nimble fingers working magic on Mrs. Gable’s gnarled, eighty-year-old hands.  Outside, the cacophony of New York City – the screech of taxi brakes, the rumble of the subway, the chatter of a thousand hurried conversations – was a muffled roar, a distant counterpoint to the quiet precision of her work.  Today, however, the usual rhythm of her day felt…off.  A tension, subtle but undeniable, vibrated in the air, like a discordant note in her otherwise perfectly harmonious symphony of nail polish and cuticle care.
