The flickering neon sign of the "Lucky 7 Diner" cast a sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked streets of Portland, Oregon.  Dr. Eleanor Vance, a forensic psychologist with eyes the color of a stormy sea and a perpetually tired sigh etched into her features, hunched deeper into her worn leather jacket.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp asphalt and cheap coffee – a familiar perfume in the city's underbelly where she often found herself.  Across the street, the imposing silhouette of the Multnomah County Courthouse loomed, a gothic monument to justice, or at least the attempt at it.  Tonight, however, justice felt miles away, replaced by the chilling weight of a case that had sunk its teeth into Eleanor's already burdened mind. The diner's cracked vinyl booth offered little comfort, but it was better than the sterile environment of her office, a place that held too many echoes of broken minds and shattered lives.  The lukewarm coffee in her mug did little to soothe the icy dread that had settled in her gut.  It had been three days since the call, three days since the body was found… three days since the whispers started.
