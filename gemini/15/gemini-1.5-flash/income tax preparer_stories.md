Mildred, a woman whose age defied easy categorization – somewhere between "distinguished" and "ancient mariner" – attacked the last vestiges of the April 15th rush with the focused intensity of a seasoned warrior facing down a horde of goblins.

Outside, the city roared its usual symphony of sirens and hurried footsteps, a cacophony entirely muted by the white noise of Mildred's own concentration.
