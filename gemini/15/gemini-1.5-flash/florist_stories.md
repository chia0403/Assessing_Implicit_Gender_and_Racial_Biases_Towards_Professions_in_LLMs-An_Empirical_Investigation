The scent of lilies, sharp and sweet, hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the damp chill clinging to the cobblestones of Rainswept Lane.  Water, shed from the eaves of the crooked, gabled houses that lined the street, trickled down into the overflowing gutters, creating a miniature, murmuring river.  Above, the sky was a bruised plum, threatening more of the relentless rain that had plagued the small coastal town of Port Blossom for the past week.  Inside "Petals & Promises," however, a warm, inviting glow spilled onto the rain-slicked street, beckoning passersby into its fragrant embrace.  This was where Aurelia Blackwood, owner and sole florist, spent her days surrounded by vibrant blooms, their delicate beauty a balm against the persistent gloom.
