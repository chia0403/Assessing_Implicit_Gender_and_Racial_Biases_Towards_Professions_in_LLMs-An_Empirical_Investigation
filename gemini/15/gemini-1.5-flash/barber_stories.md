The scent of Bay Rum and stale coffee hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Elias Thorne, barber and proprietor of Thorne's Tonsorial Parlour.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grimy windowpane of his shop, illuminating the swirling particles like tiny, glittering galaxies.  Outside, the relentless rhythm of the city – the screech of trolley cars, the rumble of delivery trucks, the distant wail of a siren – pulsed against the quiet hum of Elias's electric clippers.  But within the confines of his small, cluttered shop on the edge of the Gaslight District, a peculiar stillness reigned, broken only by the rhythmic snip-snip of his shears and the occasional cough from the ancient, leather armchair that sat patiently awaiting its next client.  The chipped porcelain mugs on the counter, testament to countless cups of lukewarm coffee consumed over years of listening to the city's secrets, seemed to hold their breath, waiting for the next story to unfold.
