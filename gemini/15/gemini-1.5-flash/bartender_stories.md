The chipped Formica countertop of "The Rusty Mug" felt cold beneath Elara Vance's fingertips.  Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes, blurring the neon glow of the liquor store across the street into a hazy, psychedelic smear.  Inside, the air hung thick with the cloying sweetness of cheap bourbon and the acrid bite of stale beer.  Elara, a woman whose face bore the map of a thousand late nights and a million untold stories, polished a glass with practiced ease, her movements as fluid and precise as a surgeon’s. The only sound louder than the storm was the rhythmic clinking of ice in the well-worn shaker, a counterpoint to the melancholic blues drifting from the jukebox in the corner. Tonight, however, even the familiar rhythm felt off-kilter, a discordant note in the symphony of urban decay that was her nightly routine.  Something felt…different.
