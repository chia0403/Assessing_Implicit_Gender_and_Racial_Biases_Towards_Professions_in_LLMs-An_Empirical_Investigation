The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of frying plantains and exhaust fumes, a symphony of smells Dr. Evelyn Reed was unfortunately quite accustomed to.  Evelyn, a registered dietitian and nutritionist with a specialty in community health, adjusted her crisp white blouse, a stark contrast to the vibrant chaos of the Mercado Central in San José, Costa Rica.  The sun beat down on the brightly colored stalls overflowing with exotic fruits, pungent spices, and mountains of glistening, perfectly ripe mangoes – a tempting, yet potentially treacherous, landscape for someone so dedicated to healthy eating.  Today, however, her focus wasn't on the delicious, but rather the desperately needed: Evelyn was on a mission to improve the nutritional well-being of the children in the surrounding impoverished neighborhoods, a task far more challenging than navigating any tropical fruit market.
