The fluorescent lights of the drafting room hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic scratch of Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s pencil on mylar.  Dust motes, illuminated like tiny galaxies, swirled in the stale air above her head, a testament to the decades of blueprints and architectural renderings that clung to the aged, mahogany drafting tables.  The room itself felt like a forgotten cathedral, vast and echoing, with towering stacks of plans – some neatly organized, others leaning precariously – threatening to topple like dominoes.  Outside, the relentless Chicago wind howled, a stark contrast to the quiet intensity within, where Amelia, her brow furrowed in concentration, painstakingly corrected a skewed dimension on the latest iteration of the proposed Zenith Tower expansion.  The smell of aging ink and faint coffee clung to the air, a familiar perfume in this sanctuary of precision and meticulous detail.
