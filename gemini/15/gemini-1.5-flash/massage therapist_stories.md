The scent of lavender and sandalwood hung heavy in the air, a comforting balm against the relentless drumming of rain against the corrugated iron roof of Serenity Now Massage.  Inside, the only light came from a single Himalayan salt lamp, casting a warm, rosy glow on the polished wooden floors and the intricately carved daybed where Amelia Grace Hawthorne lay.  Amelia, a massage therapist with hands as deft as a surgeon's and a heart as soft as the down pillows she used, sighed contentedly.  The storm outside mirrored the turmoil she’d felt all day, a knot of anxiety tightening in her chest, but the rhythmic kneading of her own tired muscles, a self-administered treatment before closing, was slowly unwinding it.  The only sound besides the rain was the gentle crackle of the salt lamp and the whisper of her own breathing. Tonight, however, even the usual tranquility of her sanctuary felt tinged with something else… a subtle premonition, a prickling at the edges of her awareness that something was about to change.
