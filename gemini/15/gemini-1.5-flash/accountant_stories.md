The flickering gaslight cast long, skeletal shadows across the ledger pages, painting Amelia Beatrice Finch's already pale face in shades of grey.  The air in the counting house hung thick with the smell of old parchment, dried ink, and something faintly metallic – the lingering scent of fear, perhaps.  It was a chill November evening in 1888, the wind howling a mournful dirge outside the tall, gothic windows of Blackwood & Sons, Chartered Accountants.  Rain lashed against the panes, mirroring the tempest brewing in Amelia’s meticulously organized mind.  She hadn’t slept properly in days, the unsolved mystery of the missing funds gnawing at her like a persistent rat in the walls.  This wasn't just any discrepancy; this was a chasm in the accounts, a black hole swallowing thousands of pounds – enough to send Blackwood & Sons spiralling into ruin.
