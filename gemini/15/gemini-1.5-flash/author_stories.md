The salt spray stung Amelia Jane Hawthorne's face, a familiar discomfort she welcomed as a counterpoint to the stifling humidity clinging to the air like a shroud.  Amelia, or Amy as her friends – few and far between these days – called her, gripped the railing of the ferry, the churning wake a frothy white against the bruised purple of the late afternoon sky.  The scent of brine and diesel hung heavy, a stark contrast to the fragrant jasmine and hibiscus that usually perfumed her sun-drenched island home of Kauai.  She’d escaped, fled even, to this tiny, perpetually overcast isle of Oahu, seeking refuge not from a hurricane, but from the tempest brewing within her own mind – a writer’s block so profound it threatened to drown her creativity altogether.  The rhythmic chug of the ferry engine, the cries of gulls overhead, even the rhythmic slap of waves against the hull, offered a tentative, unwelcome solace.  She needed more than the muted roar of the Pacific; she needed inspiration, and she hoped, desperately, to find it in the shadowed corners of Honolulu.
