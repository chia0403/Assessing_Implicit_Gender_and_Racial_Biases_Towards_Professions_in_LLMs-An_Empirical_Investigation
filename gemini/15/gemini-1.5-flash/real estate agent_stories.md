The relentless Florida sun beat down on Amelia Hernandezâ€™s shoulders, baking the already stifling air thick and heavy with the scent of hibiscus and saltwater.  Sweat beaded on her forehead, despite the crisp, white linen of her pantsuit. Amelia, meticulously applying a fresh layer of lip gloss in her rearview mirror, sighed.  Another open house, another sweltering Saturday on the idyllic, yet brutally competitive, shores of Bonita Springs.  The pastel-colored houses, each vying for attention with meticulously landscaped lawns and pristine swimming pools, lined the street like sugary confections, beautiful but ultimately disposable in the eyes of the relentless real estate market.  Today's offering, a sprawling Mediterranean-style villa on almost an acre overlooking Estero Bay, was particularly high-stakes.  It was priced aggressively, pushing the boundaries of what even Bonita Springs' burgeoning luxury market could bear.  Amelia adjusted her sunglasses, a glint of steely determination in her eyes.  This wasn't just another sale; it was a test, a chance to prove she was more than just another pretty face in a cutthroat industry.
