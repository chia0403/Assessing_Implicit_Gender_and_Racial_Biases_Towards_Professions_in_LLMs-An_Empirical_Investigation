The salt spray kissed Elias Thorne's weathered face as he wrestled the recalcitrant oak plank onto the small, bobbing boat.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and pine, carried the mournful cry of gulls overhead.  Elias, a carpenter by trade and a man whose hands were as rough as barnacle-encrusted pilings, squinted at the grey expanse of the North Sea.  The tiny fishing village of Port Blossom huddled at the foot of the cliffs, a cluster of brightly painted houses clinging precariously to the land like limpets to a rock.  The fishing boats, most of them smaller than his own sturdy workboat, were already returning, their sails furled like tired wings against the gathering dusk.  Tonight, however, Elias wasn't fishing. He had a far more important job to do.
