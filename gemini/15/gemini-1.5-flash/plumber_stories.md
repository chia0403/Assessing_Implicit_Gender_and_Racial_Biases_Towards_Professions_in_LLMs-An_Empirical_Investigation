The rusty swing set groaned a mournful tune in the blustering November wind, its chains rattling like skeletal fingers against the decaying wooden frame.  Fallen leaves, the colour of dried blood, clung to the damp earth surrounding the dilapidated Victorian house at 13 Grimwald Lane.  This wasn't the kind of job Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield Jr. usually took, but the desperation in Mrs. Periwinkle's voice on the phone had been enough to convince him.  The biting wind whipped at his already soaked overalls as he wrestled his toolbox from the back of his battered van, its "Butterfield's Plumbing: We unclog your troubles" decal barely visible under a layer of grime. The air hung heavy with the smell of damp earth and something elseâ€¦ something subtly rotten, like a forgotten corpse.  Barty shivered, pulling his worn woolen cap lower over his ears. This was going to be a long day.
