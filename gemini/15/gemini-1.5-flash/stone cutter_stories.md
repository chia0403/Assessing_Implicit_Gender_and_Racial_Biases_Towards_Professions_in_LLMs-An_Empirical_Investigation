The rasp of steel on granite echoed through the cavernous workshop, a counterpoint to the rhythmic drip, drip, drip of water from a perpetually leaking roof.  Dust motes, thick as summer gnats, danced in the single shaft of sunlight slicing through the grime-coated window.  Elias Thorne, his hands calloused and stained the ochre of the very stone he shaped, paused his work.  The air hung heavy with the scent of wet stone and something else, something sharper, something likeâ€¦fear.  Elias, a man whose life revolved around the precise, predictable dance of chisel and hammer, felt a tremor run deeper than the vibrations of his own tools. It wasn't in the stone, but in the air itself, a prickling unease that settled on his skin like a cold shroud. He wiped a bead of sweat from his brow, the granite dust clinging to his skin, and listened.  The silence, broken only by the persistent drip, drip, drip, was somehow more unsettling than the sound of his work ever had been.
