The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face, a familiar kiss from the unforgiving Atlantic.  He gripped his worn easel, its legs sinking slightly into the yielding sand of Porthcurno beach, the wind whipping his already unruly auburn hair across his eyes.  The sky, a bruised purple bleeding into a fiery orange sunset, mirrored the turbulent emotions churning within him.  Elias, a landscape artist renowned for his dramatic seascapes, felt anything but inspired.  His usually vibrant palette lay untouched, the brushes stiff and accusing in their leather case.  For weeks, the canvases had remained blank, a stark reflection of the creative drought gripping him tighter than the Cornish wind.  The rhythmic crash of waves against the jagged rocks below was a constant, relentless reminder of the untamed power of nature â€“ a power he desperately needed to recapture, to translate onto his canvas before it swallowed him whole.
