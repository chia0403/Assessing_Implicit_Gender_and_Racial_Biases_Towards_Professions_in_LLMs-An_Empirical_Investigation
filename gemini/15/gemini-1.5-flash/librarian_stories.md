The scent of aged paper and leather, a perfume both comforting and slightly melancholic, hung heavy in the air of the Grand Blackwood Library.  Dust motes, illuminated by the afternoon sun slanting through the tall, arched windows, danced in the quiet stillness.  Eleanor Vance, a woman whose life was as meticulously cataloged as the libraryâ€™s own vast collection, adjusted her spectacles, the thin wire frames pinching gently against her nose.  Outside, a relentless November rain lashed against the gothic stone facade, a counterpoint to the hushed reverence within.  The Grand Blackwood, a sprawling labyrinth of towering bookshelves and whispering alcoves, was her domain, her sanctuary, and tonight, the stage for a discovery that would unravel everything she thought she knew.
