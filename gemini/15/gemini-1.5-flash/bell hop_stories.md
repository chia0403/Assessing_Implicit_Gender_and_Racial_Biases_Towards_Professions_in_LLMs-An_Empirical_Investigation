The brass spittoon gleamed under the single, flickering gas lamp in the dimly lit lobby of the Grand Majestic Hotel.  Dust motes, illuminated like tiny, frantic stars, danced in the stale air thick with the scent of aged mahogany, pipe tobacco, and something indefinably…sour.  It was the kind of sour that clung to the edges of things, hinting at spilled drinks and forgotten secrets.  This was the aroma of the Grand Majestic, a once-grand dame now clinging precariously to her faded glory.  Twenty-year-old Jasper Bartholomew Finch, his bellhop uniform – once crisp white, now a slightly dingy off-white – meticulously pressed, adjusted the already perfectly positioned cap on his head.  The weight of his brass tray, currently holding only a single, slightly dented silver ice bucket, felt heavier than usual.  Tonight, even the quiet hum of the hotel’s ancient elevator sounded like a mournful sigh.
