The chipped paint of Dr. Eleanor Vance's waiting room seemed to sigh with the rhythmic drip, drip, drip of a leaky faucet – a counterpoint to the frantic scratching of her pen across the notepad. Rain lashed against the tall, gothic windows of her Victorian practice, blurring the already indistinct gaslight glow of the cobblestone street outside.  November in Edinburgh clung to her like a damp wool shawl, a pervasive chill that mirrored the unease settling in Eleanor’s stomach.  This wasn't the usual pre-session jitters; this felt… different.  The scent of damp earth and woodsmoke, usually comforting, was overshadowed by a metallic tang that clung to the air, a phantom smell clinging to the edges of her awareness, hinting at something unsettling, something far beyond the usual anxieties of her clients.
