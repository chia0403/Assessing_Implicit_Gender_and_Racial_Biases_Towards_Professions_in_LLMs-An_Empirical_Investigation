The biting wind whipped off the glacier, stinging Sergeant Valerius Thorne’s cheeks and making his already stiff fingers ache.  He hunched deeper into his furs, the rough wool scratching against his worn leather jerkin.  Above, the jagged peaks of the Dragon’s Teeth mountains clawed at the bruised purple sky, their snow-capped summits reflecting the dying light of the setting sun.  Valerius shifted his weight, the cold seeping through the worn soles of his boots and into the very marrow of his bones. He was stationed at the Outpost of Whispering Pines, the most desolate, windswept, and arguably cursed post in the entire Kingdom of Eldoria.  Its sole purpose: to guard the treacherous, ice-choked pass that led to the forbidden lands beyond.  Tonight, however, the silence was unnerving, a silence far heavier than the usual howl of the wind.  It was a silence that promised something far worse than the bitter cold.
