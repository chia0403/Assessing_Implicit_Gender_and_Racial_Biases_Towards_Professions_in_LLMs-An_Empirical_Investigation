Professor Augustine Blackwood adjusted his tweed jacket, the worn fabric whispering against the crisp autumn air.  The scent of damp earth and decaying leaves clung to the twilight, a familiar perfume in the ancient, ivy-clad grounds of Blackwood University.  The gothic spires of the main building, silhouetted against the bruised purple sky, loomed over him like skeletal fingers reaching for the heavens.  A lone owl hooted from the depths of the overgrown quad, its cry echoing the unease churning in Augustine's stomach. This wasn't the usual pre-lecture jitters; tonight felt different, heavier, laced with a foreboding he couldn't quite name.  The manuscript clutched in his hand, its pages filled with cryptic symbols and unsettling sketches, throbbed with a silent, unsettling energy.  Tonight, he wasn't just lecturing on ancient Sumerian mythology; tonight, he felt like he was stepping into it.
