The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the cramped kitchen of "The Rusty Mug," a pub nestled in the cobbled alleys of Southwark, London, 1888.  Dust motes, illuminated by the orange glow, swirled in the air, mingling with the pungent aroma of roasting lamb and simmering thyme.  Amelia Penelope Featherstone, a cook with eyes the colour of burnt umber and hands calloused from years of wielding a cleaver, meticulously arranged a platter of golden-crusted pies.  Each pie, a miniature masterpiece of flaky pastry and spiced filling, awaited its place on the warming trays.  Tonight, the pub was expecting a larger than usual crowd – the annual Harvest Festival was in full swing, and the aroma of the pies was already drawing the hungry patrons to the front door.  Amelia, her apron stained with flour and a faint hint of paprika, felt a familiar thrum of energy pulse through her veins. The rhythm of the kitchen, the rhythmic clanging of pans, the excited chatter of the barkeep – it was the music she knew and loved.  This night, the rhythmic beat of her culinary symphony would dictate the merriment of the Southwark Harvest.
