The biting wind whipped Amelia Hayes’s crimson scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks as she surveyed the frozen expanse of the hockey rink.  The air, thick with the smell of pine needles and something vaguely metallic – likely the remnants of last night's game – hung heavy.  Outside, the frosted branches of the ancient pines that framed the rink clawed at the bruised grey sky, a mirrored reflection of the turmoil simmering within her.  Amelia Hayes, Head Coach of the  "Frostbite Flyers," a youth hockey team renowned for their grit and resilience, felt the familiar weight of expectation pressing down on her shoulders, a weight that felt heavier than usual this season.


This year’s season had been particularly fraught.  The Flyers, usually a force to be reckoned with, were struggling.  Not just losing – though that was a constant threat – but struggling in practice, with fractured morale and interpersonal conflicts amongst the players. The once vibrant energy of the rink was now a muted thrum, a low growl instead of a roar. The ornate hockey boards, their glossy finish dulled by years of countless pucks and fights, seemed to reflect the despair in her heart.  A single flickering fluorescent light buzzed above her head, casting long, spindly shadows that danced with the movement of the frost on the ice.
