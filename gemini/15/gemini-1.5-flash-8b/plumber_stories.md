The chipped porcelain sink, stained a sickly yellow from years of neglected limescale, gurgled and spat, mirroring the frustration bubbling in Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's chest.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the dilapidated tenement building, a relentless percussion that echoed the frantic thump of his heart.  Barty, a plumber of surprisingly delicate hands, crouched beside the overflowing sink, his brow furrowed in concentration.  The tenant, Mrs. Periwinkle, a woman whose enthusiasm for floral wallpaper rivaled her disdain for plumbing, had predictably reported a "minor leak."  Minor, Barty thought, pinching the bridge of his nose.  This wasn't a minor leak. This was a catastrophe waiting to happen, and Barty, the sole plumber for the entire dilapidated block of flats, was the only one who could fix it.

**Setting:**  The Lower East Side of a city, sometime in the early 1900s.  The air hung thick with the smell of coal smoke and damp earth.  The buildings, a fractured tapestry of brick, cast-iron, and wood, clawed at a perpetually overcast sky.  Rain sludged down the alleyways, leaving puddles reflecting the dim gaslight glow.  The flats themselves were cramped, with the scent of stale bread and simmering stew weaving between the layers of grime and poverty.  Water, a precious commodity, was often a source of tension and competition.
