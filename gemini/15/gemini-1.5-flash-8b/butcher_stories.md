The chill seeped into Bartholomew "Barty" Grimshaw's bones, not from the November air whistling through the gaps in the leaky roof of "Grimshaw's Grinders," but from the sheer, palpable weight of disappointment.  He stood hunched over the stainless steel worktop, the rhythmic thwack of the cleaver a dull counterpoint to the relentless drumming of his own frustration.  The butcher shop, a cramped, brick-walled space in the heart of the grimy, post-industrial town of Ashwood, reeked of blood, sweat, and simmering despair.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light filtering through the grimy window, illuminating the gleaming rows of carcasses – a stark, silent testament to the day's meager sales.  Barty, with his perpetually smudged apron and tired eyes, had barely eked out a living for the past month.  The whispers had started.  Not the vicious, spiteful whispers of the townsfolk, but the far more insidious whispers of the butcher's knife itself, urging him toward a fatal flaw in his trade – a desperate decision that would stain his reputation and perhaps even his soul.
