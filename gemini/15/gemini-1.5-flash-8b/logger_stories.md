The biting wind, a razor-sharp blade against Elias Thorne's exposed skin, whipped through the skeletal remains of the old growth forest.  Twisted, skeletal pines, their branches clawing at the bruised, grey sky, were the only witnesses to Elias's solitary trek.  Dust devils, the ghosts of yesterday's logging trucks, danced across the scarred earth, carrying with them the faint scent of pine and something acrid, something metallic â€“ the lingering taste of blood.  Elias, his weathered face etched with the lines of a thousand sunrises and a thousand sunsets spent amongst the trees, pushed deeper into the desolate expanse, his boots crunching on the broken needles and the splintered remnants of a life that had once thrived.

The setting sun, a bruised plum colour, painted the jagged peaks of the distant Blue Ridge Mountains in hues of violence.  Elias's small, one-room cabin, nestled precariously on a slope overlooking a ravine, represented a fragile haven against the unforgiving wilderness, a sanctuary of solitude in a world that had become increasingly harsh.  The cabin, built from rough-hewn timbers salvaged from the very trees he felled, emitted a warm glow, a beacon of human warmth against the encroaching chill of the autumnal night.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of pinewood smoke and the faint aroma of stew simmering on the hearth. But tonight, the warm comfort of his home felt bittersweet; a hollow echo to the empty spaces in his heart.
