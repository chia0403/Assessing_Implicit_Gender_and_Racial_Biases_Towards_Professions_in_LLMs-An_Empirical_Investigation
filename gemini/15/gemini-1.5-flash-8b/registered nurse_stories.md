The fluorescent hum of the emergency room vibrated through Amelia Thorne's bones, a constant, low thrumming that felt almost internal now.  The sterile, white walls seemed to press in, reflecting the chaotic ballet of activity around her.  A frantic doctor, Dr. Ramirez, was shouting instructions at a team of nurses, their voices a tangled web of urgency.  The air, already thick with the smell of antiseptic and fear, was growing heavy with the metallic tang of blood.  Amelia, a registered nurse with five years of experience at St. Jude's Memorial Hospital, felt the familiar knot tighten in her stomach.  Tonight was going to be a long one.

The emergency room, a concrete fortress of sterile white and muted grays, throbbed with a relentless energy.  Rows of examination tables, each a small island of pale linen, were scattered amidst the flurry of activity.  The beeping of heart monitors, the rhythmic hiss of IV pumps, and the occasional shriek of a patient in pain formed an almost unbearable symphony of distress.  The rhythmic clatter of the automated doors echoed through the space, each opening and closing a stark punctuation mark in the cacophony, marking the arrival and departure of another victim of the city's relentless pace.  Outside, the city lights blurred through the large windows, casting shifting patterns of color across the room, making the chaos feel both contained and magnified.  Tonight, it felt as though the entire city's anxieties were gathered within these sterile walls.
