The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Blackwood's crimson coat around her legs as she hurried down the cobbled alley.  Rain, already a relentless curtain, hammered against the ancient stone walls, echoing the frantic rhythm of her own footsteps.  London, shrouded in a perpetual grey, felt heavier than usual that evening.  The scent of damp earth and coal smoke clung to the air, mingling with the acrid tang of something else – something burnt, something…unnatural.

Amy, a solicitor with the prestigious firm of Sterling & Thorne, was already running late.  The case of the Marquis de Valois, a seemingly straightforward breach of contract, had unexpectedly spiraled into a labyrinth of whispers, shadowy figures, and increasingly unsettling clues.  Now, with the client's ornate apartment building shrouded in a fog thicker than fear, she was on a desperate mission – to find answers, before the secrets of the past consumed her present.

The alley, a narrow chasm between towering Georgian houses, offered little respite.  Broken glass crunched beneath her boots, and a flickering gas lamp cast long, skeletal shadows that seemed to writhe with unseen entities. The air itself hummed with a low, uneasy thrumming, a constant reminder of the darkness lurking beneath the city's elegant veneer.  Amy’s breath fogged in the cold air, each gasp feeling like a defiant challenge to the oppressive weight of the night.  This, she knew instinctively, was no ordinary breach of contract.  This was something far, far darker.
