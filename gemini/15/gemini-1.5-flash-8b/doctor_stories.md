The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of the Aeridorian Waste, stinging Dr. Elara Seraphina’s cheeks as she adjusted the worn leather straps of her pack.  Dust devils danced in the pale, hazy sunlight, swirling around the skeletal remains of what had once been a bustling trading post.  The air, thick with the scent of dried herbs and something acrid, metallic, hung heavy, like a shroud.  Three days she had been traversing this unforgiving landscape, the relentless sun beating down on her, the silence broken only by the rhythmic crunch of her boots on the cracked earth.  The whispers of the dying village—the fever, the strange lesions, the inexplicable deaths—had followed her like a persistent shadow.  Now, perched on the edge of the ruined marketplace, she scanned the surrounding emptiness, the only sign of life the skeletal remains of a flock of birds lying scattered about, their wingtips frozen in mid-flight.  Her mission: to find the source of the epidemic that had decimated this community.  Her hope: to find a cure.  Her life: entirely invested in saving the lives of others, one desperate battle at a time.
