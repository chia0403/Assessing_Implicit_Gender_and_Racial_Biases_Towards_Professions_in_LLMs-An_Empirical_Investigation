The fluorescent lights of the "Apex Architectural Designs" office hummed, a constant, irritating drone that echoed the quiet desperation in Amelia Butterfield's chest.  Rain hammered against the single, grimy window of the reception area, mirroring the relentless stream of paperwork piling precariously on her desk.  Amelia, a petite woman with perpetually tired eyes, stared blankly at the overflowing inbox, each piece of architectural renderings, blueprints, and client proposals looking like a miniature, infuriating mountain range. Today, her only comfort was the rhythmic clicking of the mechanical pencil in her hand, a counterpoint to the relentless symphony of building-related woes that plagued the office.  Apex was in the heart of the city, a glittering tower of glass and steel that seemed to mock the small, slightly dishevelled office Amelia inhabited on its ground floor.  The city's energy surged around the building, but within the reception area, a quiet, almost claustrophobic tension hung heavy in the air.
