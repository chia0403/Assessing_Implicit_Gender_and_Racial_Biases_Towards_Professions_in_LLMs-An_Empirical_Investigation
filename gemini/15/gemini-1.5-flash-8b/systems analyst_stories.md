The fluorescent hum of the server room was Elias Thorne's lullaby.  Elias Thorne, systems analyst extraordinaire (or so he liked to tell himself), hunched over a bank of monitors, their glowing surfaces reflecting the tired lines etched around his eyes.  Outside, the neon-drenched cityscape of Neo-Kyoto pulsed with a feverish energy he rarely shared.  He was a creature of the digital, a ghost in the machine, navigating the intricate pathways of the city's sprawling data network.  His office, a small, sparsely furnished cubicle tucked away in the bowels of the Global Data Exchange (GDE) headquarters, was a monument to quiet efficiency.  Empty coffee cups and crumpled packets of instant ramen lay testament to the long nights and even longer days he'd been enduring.  The air, thick with the metallic scent of server farms and the faint tang of stale pizza, was a constant reminder of his isolation.  Today, however, the hum of the servers had a different quality, a subtle tremor that prickled Elias's skin.  The network was experiencingâ€¦anomalous behavior.
