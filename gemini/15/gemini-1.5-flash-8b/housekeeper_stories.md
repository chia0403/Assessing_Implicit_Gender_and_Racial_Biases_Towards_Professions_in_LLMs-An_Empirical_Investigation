The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the polished mahogany floors of Blackwood Manor, illuminating dust motes that swirled like tiny, spectral dancers.  A chill, deeper than the autumn air, permeated the grand hall, clinging to the faded velvet upholstery and the heavy, carved portraits staring down from the walls.  Amelia Blackwood, housekeeper for the Blackwood family for the past twenty-five years, adjusted the frayed collar of her starched linen uniform.  The air, thick with the scent of aged parchment and beeswax, held the faint, lingering echo of laughter, now silenced by the passage of time and the creeping shadows of the coming night.  Amelia, with her hands calloused from years of scrubbing and polishing,  felt a familiar knot of unease tighten in her chest.  Tonight, something felt different.  The manor, usually a symphony of hushed footsteps and the gentle creaking of aged timbers, was unnervingly quiet.  The Blackwood family had retreated to their rooms, leaving Amelia to the watchful gaze of the house, a silent guardian of its secrets.
