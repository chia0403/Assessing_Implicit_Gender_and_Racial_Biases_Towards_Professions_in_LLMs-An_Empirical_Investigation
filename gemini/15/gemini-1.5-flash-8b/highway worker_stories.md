The sun beat down on Amelia Rodriguez's back, the asphalt shimmering like a molten river beneath her worn boots.  Dust, fine and gritty, clung to everything â€“ her faded khaki uniform, the mangled remnants of a discarded cardboard box, even the stubborn wisps of hair clinging to her sweat-slicked forehead.  She squinted at the cracked pavement, the pothole a yawning maw in the otherwise monotonous stretch of I-95.  Today, Amelia Rodriguez, highway maintenance worker for the state of Georgia, wasn't just patching a hole; she was patching a piece of herself.


Setting: A desolate stretch of I-95 just outside of Savannah, Georgia, on a sweltering summer afternoon.  The air hung thick and heavy, the only sound the incessant whine of the highway patrol car occasionally passing by, and the rhythmic thump of Amelia's jackhammer against the asphalt.  Abandoned billboards, bearing faded advertisements for long-forgotten businesses, lined the roadside, a poignant reminder of time's relentless passage.   The highway itself seemed to stretch into infinity, disappearing into the hazy horizon, mirroring the feeling of isolation Amelia sometimes felt.
