The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine and something faintly metallic, clinging to Amelia Hawthorne’s uniform.  She traced the condensation clinging to the polished surface of the window, watching the city of Kuala Lumpur spread out below – a kaleidoscope of glittering skyscrapers piercing the bruised twilight sky.  The Singapore Airlines 787-9, *The Jewel of the Skies,*  was just beginning its descent into the bustling international airport. Amelia, a seasoned flight attendant with five years under her belt, felt a familiar tremor of apprehension – not fear, but a quiet, professional unease.  Something about this flight felt…off.

The setting: The upper deck of the Singapore Airlines 787-9, The Jewel of the Skies,  moments before landing in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.  Rain was beginning to fall against the glass, and the city lights, normally welcoming, held a hint of foreboding in the gathering dusk.  The air inside the plane was a blend of the comforting hum of the engines and the subtle murmur of hushed conversations amongst the passengers.  Yet, in this hum and murmur, Amelia sensed a simmering tension, a quiet anticipation that echoed her own growing unease.
