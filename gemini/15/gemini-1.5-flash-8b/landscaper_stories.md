The sun, a molten coin sinking below the jagged peaks of the Whispering Hills, cast long, skeletal shadows across Elara Meadowbrook's meticulously manicured lawn.  Dust motes danced in the last sliver of golden light, illuminating the perfect symmetry of the hydrangeas – a riot of lavender and blush – that bordered the manicured stone path leading to the grand Tudor manor.  Elara, a landscaper with hands as steady as polished jade and eyes as keen as a hawk's, carefully trimmed the final sprig of rosemary, its fragrant needles whispering secrets only she seemed to understand.  It was the culmination of a long day, a day that had begun in the pre-dawn chill with the methodical pruning of the Japanese maple and ended here, bathed in the warm, final hues of the fading day.  Her name, Elara Meadowbrook, resonated with the quiet grace of the valley itself, a valley nestled between the rugged mountains and a shimmering lake.
