The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Apothecary's Corner" cast an eerie glow on Amelia Nightingale's meticulously organized shelves.  Each vial, each tinctured jar, each meticulously labeled packet of herbs whispered secrets in the hushed, quiet store, secrets only she, Amelia Nightingale, the pharmacist, seemed to understand.  The scent of lavender and chamomile, usually comforting, hung heavy in the air tonight, laced with a strange, metallic tang that prickled Amelia's nostrils.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of moonlight piercing the grime-coated window, illuminating a single, crimson stain on the worn linoleum floor.

The apothecary, nestled in the shadowed backstreets of the decaying Victorian district of Alderwood, was more of a sanctuary than a shop.  Its worn wooden counters, once polished to a gleam, now showed the marks of countless transactions.  Dusty antique books, overflowing with cryptic formulas and faded botanical illustrations, lined the walls, whispering tales of forgotten remedies and lost cures.  The only other sound besides Amelia's quiet hum of activity was the rhythmic ticking of a grandfather clock in the adjacent house, each tick a hammer blow against the stillness.  Tonight, however, the clock's sound seemed to be a frantic counterpoint to the unsettling silence.
