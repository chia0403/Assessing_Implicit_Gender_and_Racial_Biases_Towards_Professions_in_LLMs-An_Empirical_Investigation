The frost, clinging to the rusted iron fence that bordered the dilapidated clinic, seemed to mirror the icy despair settling in Amelia's gut.  The clinic, nestled in the shadow of the looming, snow-capped peaks of the Cascade Mountains, was a testament to the unforgiving landscape.  Scattered icicles, like frozen tears, hung from the eaves, mirroring the silent, watchful presence of the jagged mountain peaks.  The air, thin and crisp, carried the faint scent of pine and something else, something metallic and unsettling, that hung in the air like a shroud.  This was the remote town of Alder Creek, a place where the rhythm of life was dictated by the relentless rhythm of snow and silence, a place where even the most seasoned physician's assistants were tested.  Amelia, however, found herself more lost in the desolate silence than she had ever imagined. The once-vibrant clinic, usually humming with the low thrum of medical equipment and the hushed murmurs of conversations, now felt oddly empty. Today, a stark and unnerving quiet settled over everything.
