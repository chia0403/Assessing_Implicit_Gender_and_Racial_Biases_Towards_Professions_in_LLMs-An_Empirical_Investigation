The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's auburn hair across her face, stinging her cheeks with icy needles.  Snow, thick and relentless, blanketed the sprawling grounds of Blackwood Manor, obscuring the ancient oak trees that formed a sentinel line around the sprawling estate.  Amelia, Animal Caretaker for Blackwood Manor, hunched deeper into her thick wool coat, her breath puffing out in white clouds.  The manor itself, a gothic masterpiece of gray stone and intricate carvings, seemed to shrink into the snowy landscape, a silent giant brooding under the relentless assault of the storm.  Inside, the rhythmic ticking of grandfather clocks echoed through the vast halls, a stark contrast to the howling wind outside.  Her task tonight, as always, was to ensure the comfort of the estate's menagerie: from the pampered Persian cats in their sun-drenched boudoir to the formidable wolves in their secluded enclosure.  But tonight, something felt different. A gnawing unease, a premonition of something amiss, clung to her like the icy fog itself.
