The biting wind, a relentless, icy claw, ripped at Barnaby "Barty" Butterfield's weathered jacket.  He squinted, the glare of the midday sun reflecting off the stark, grey expanse of the cathedral roof.  Below, the cobbled streets of Oldminster pulsed with a frenetic energy –  a contrast to the serene, if chilling, solitude atop St. Michael's.  Barty, a roofer with hands that had known the weight of lead and the bite of frost for over twenty years, hauled himself up another precarious section of the sloping slate.  This wasn't just any roof; this was the spire, the very heart of the cathedral, a place where centuries of whispers and prayers had been etched into the very stones.

The setting was Oldminster, a city nestled in the valley of the whispering Windward Peaks.  The city's history clung to its every cobbled street, every arched alleyway, every weathered stone façade.  For generations, the Butterfield family had been roofers of Oldminster, their hands knowing the intricacies of the city's ancient roofscapes, their eyes trained to discern the subtle signs of hidden decay. The cathedral, a towering monument to faith and craftsmanship, had seen centuries come and go, and was now, like the city around it, beginning to show its age.  Barty was one of the last of the Butterfield roofers, tasked with preserving not just the cathedral's structure, but the city's connection to its past.
