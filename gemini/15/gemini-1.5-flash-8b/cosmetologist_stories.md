The scent of jasmine and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air of "Threads of Time," a salon nestled deep within the cobbled alleyways of Old Montmartre.  Dust motes danced in the filtered sunlight streaming through the arched window above the crimson velvet drapes.  This was the domain of  Isabelle Dubois, a cosmetologist whose fingers, nimble and precise, could sculpt beauty from the most stubborn strands.  Isabelle, with her perpetually tired but determined eyes and a cascade of raven hair that defied any attempt at a perfect curl, had been tending to the needs of Parisian society for fifteen years.  Today, however, a different kind of tension hung in the air, a palpable expectancy that had nothing to do with the usual pre-gala jitters of her clientele.  A new, particularly enigmatic woman sat in the stylist's chair, her face obscured by a wide-brimmed hat and a scarf that muffled her voice.  Isabelle, recognizing the peculiar stillness of this particular client, felt a shiver run down her spine, a sensation she couldn't quite place.  The city, with its usual cacophony of honking taxis and chattering voices, seemed to hold its breath.  The air felt thick with secrets, just waiting to be revealed.
