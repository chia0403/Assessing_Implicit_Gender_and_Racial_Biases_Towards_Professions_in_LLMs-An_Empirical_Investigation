The chipped paint of the easel, a faded turquoise, reflected the sickly yellow light filtering through the grime-coated window of Amelia Blackwood's attic studio.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of sunlight, illuminating swirling brushstrokes of ochre and indigo on a canvas that depicted a wilting sunflower.  Amelia, a wisp of a woman with eyes the colour of stormy seas and fingers stained perpetually with burnt sienna, hunched over her work.  The air, thick with the scent of linseed oil and damp earth, held a palpable stillness, broken only by the rhythmic click of her paintbrush against the canvas.  The attic itself was a testament to years of neglect.  Cobwebs hung like macabre tapestries from the decaying beams, and the air grew colder with each breath she took, a chilling reminder of the isolation she had chosen.  This was her sanctuary, her battlefield, her creative tomb.  Outside, the relentless drumming of rain against the aged shingles echoed the tumultuous thoughts brewing within her mind.
