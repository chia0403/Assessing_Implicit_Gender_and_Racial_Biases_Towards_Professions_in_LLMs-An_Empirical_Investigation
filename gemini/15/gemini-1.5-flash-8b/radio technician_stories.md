The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Microphone" cast a sickly yellow glow across the rain-slicked alley.  Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of solder fumes and stale coffee.  Amelia "Amy" Cartwright, radio technician extraordinaire, hunched over a tangle of wires, a greasy wrench clutched in her calloused hand.  Her name, whispered on the lips of the late-night shift workers, was synonymous with reliable transmissions and the occasional miracle. Tonight, however, the only miracle she seemed capable of conjuring was a functioning soldering iron. The year was 1948.  The city of New Zenith, humming with the anxious energy of a postwar world, was wrapped in a blanket of a late October drizzle.

Amy worked in a cramped, cluttered workshop, a small haven tucked behind the bustling marketplace.  Stacks of vintage radios, some with missing dials and cracked casings, sat like silent sentinels.  A worn, leather-bound logbook, filled with cryptic notations and hastily scrawled schematics, rested on a cluttered workbench next to a half-eaten sandwich and a chipped ceramic mug. Outside the window, the rhythmic clang of metal on metal from the factory across the street blended with the low hum of the city, creating a soundtrack to Amy's quiet battles against time and technical glitches.
