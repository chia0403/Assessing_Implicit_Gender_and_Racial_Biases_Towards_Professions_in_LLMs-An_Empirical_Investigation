The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Petrova's hands, a meager comfort against the relentless November wind whistling through the gaps in the boarded-up windows of her tiny studio apartment.  Rain lashed against the grimy, single-paned glass, mirroring the tempest brewing within her.  Outside, the city of Greyhaven slumped under a perpetual dusk, its industrial heart thrumming with a muted, oppressive rhythm. Amelia, a graphic designer with a portfolio overflowing with vibrant, imaginative concepts, felt like the opposite: muted, drained, and profoundly uninspired.  Her latest project, a campaign for a new line of eco-friendly cleaning products, had stalled.  The client, a large corporation obsessed with sleek minimalism, refused to budge from their sterile, corporate aesthetic, suffocating the very creativity she had poured into the initial designs.  The swirling grey of the cityscape mirrored the grey fog in her mind. The only colours she could see were the ones fading from her once-boldly-coloured work samples; a testament to the project's lost potential.  Her small, sparsely furnished apartment felt like a gilded cage, its comforting familiarity a stark contrast to the overwhelming emptiness she felt.
