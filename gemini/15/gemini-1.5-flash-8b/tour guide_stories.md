The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks like a thousand tiny needles.  Above, the jagged peaks of the Swiss Alps clawed at a bruised, pewter sky.  Below, the quaint, cobbled streets of Zermatt, nestled in the valley, seemed almost surreal, a miniature village painted in muted browns and greys.  Amelia, bundled in a thick wool coat, felt a familiar prickle of excitement.  Today was her "Legends of the Matterhorn" tour, and she loved nothing more than to weave tales of the mountain's mythical past for the assembled tourists.  Her name, whispered among the hushed groups, was synonymous with the dramatic landscapes that surrounded her: Amelia Blackwood, the Matterhorn Maven.

The setting: Zermatt, Switzerland. High in the Alps, a picture-postcard village nestled at the foot of the majestic Matterhorn.  The air, crisp and thin, held the scent of pine and snow.  The vibrant colours of the village's wooden chalets and flower-laden balconies were starkly contrasted by the bleak grey sky and biting wind.  Today, the mountain was shrouded in a mysterious veil, accentuating its ominous beauty.  A palpable sense of history hung heavy in the air, whispering of climbers lost and legends whispered around flickering fires in centuries past.
