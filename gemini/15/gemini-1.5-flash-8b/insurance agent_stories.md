The flickering neon sign of the "Lucky Clover" bar cast a sickly green glow on Amelia Hawthorne's rain-slicked trench coat.  She shivered, not just from the chill autumn air, but from the knot of unease tightening in her stomach.  The bar, a notorious haunt for the city’s underbelly, smelled of stale beer and desperation.  Amelia, an insurance agent with the blandly named "Provident Protection," found herself unexpectedly drawn to its seedy charm, a dangerous attraction that went against her carefully constructed life.  She wasn't supposed to be here, wasn't supposed to be investigating a claim so…unusual.

The setting:  A dimly lit backroom of the Lucky Clover, a small, greasy spoon diner tucked behind the smoky bar.  Steam from a single, sputtering coffee machine hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint scent of burnt sugar and the acrid tang of cheap whiskey.  A thick tapestry, depicting a faded, improbable scene of cherubic cherubs, hung askew, masking any pretense of decorum.  The room hummed with low-level conversations and the clinking of glasses.  Outside, the city, a concrete jungle draped in a monochrome veil of rain, roared a distant symphony of urban life. This backroom, though, was a hushed echo of the city's tempest.  Amelia, her polished shoes and crisp skirt an odd juxtaposition against the chipped Formica table and sticky floor, felt strangely out of place. This wasn't the world of meticulously organized spreadsheets and standardized policy forms she knew.  Tonight, she was an intruder.
