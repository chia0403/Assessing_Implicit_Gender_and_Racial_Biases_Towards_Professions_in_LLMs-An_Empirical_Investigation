The chipped paint on the wrought-iron gates of Blackwood Manor creaked a mournful tune in the pre-dawn chill.  Rain, the relentless, grey-veiled kind that clung to everything, slicked the cobblestones leading to the sprawling estate.  This was Elias Thorne's domain, his kingdom of pruned hedges and meticulously manicured lawns, a kingdom he tended with a quiet, almost spiritual devotion.  Elias Thorne, 32 years old, with hands calloused but surprisingly delicate, stood beneath a gnarled oak, the faint scent of damp earth filling his lungs.  He surveyed the estate, his gaze flitting across the sleeping grandeur of the manor house, its many windows like dark eyes staring out into the misty morning.  The grounds, usually a vibrant tapestry of emerald and gold, were now subdued, muted by the incessant downpour.  It was a day, Elias knew, for hidden things to stir.


Setting: Blackwood Manor, a sprawling estate nestled deep within the English countryside, steeped in history and shrouded in an almost tangible sense of melancholy.  The estate, with its ancient oaks, overgrown rose gardens, and winding pathways, seemed to hold its breath in anticipation of whatever secrets the coming day might unearth.
