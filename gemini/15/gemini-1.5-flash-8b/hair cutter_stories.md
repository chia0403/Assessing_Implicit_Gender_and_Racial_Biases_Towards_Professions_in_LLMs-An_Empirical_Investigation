The chipped porcelain sink, stained a dull, sickly yellow from years of lukewarm water and forgotten rinses, reflected Elias Thorne's worried frown.  His fingers, nimble despite the tremor that ran through them, hovered over the delicate section of blonde highlights.  He’d promised Alistair Finch, a man who epitomized quiet desperation with his impeccably tailored suits and even more impeccably furrowed brow, a “subtle” touch-up.  Subtle was a word lost in translation, apparently, somewhere between Elias’s artistic vision and Alistair’s need for perfect control.  The salon, "Scissors & Sighs," was a testament to its name.  Dust motes danced in the single, flickering fluorescent light above the small, cluttered space, highlighting the faded posters of vintage movie stars and the faint scent of lavender hairspray.  A single, half-eaten croissant lay abandoned on a chipped Formica counter, a forgotten casualty of the afternoon's rushed appointments.  Outside, the grey Manchester sky threatened rain, mirroring the storm brewing within Elias. This wasn't just a bad haircut; this was a potential career-ending disaster.
