The chipped porcelain sink, a faded floral pattern swallowed by grime, reflected the harsh fluorescent lights of the community rehabilitation center.  Rain lashed against the single, grimy window, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Amelia Cavendish, occupational therapist.  The rhythmic drip-drip-drip of the faucet echoed the relentless beat of her thoughts, each drop a tiny hammer blow against the fragile structure of her patience.  It was Tuesday, the day the new resident arrived.  Tuesday, the day everything seemed poised to unravel.

Ameliaâ€™s small office, tucked away at the end of a long, echoing corridor, was a testament to her practicality, not her passion.  Barely enough space for her battered desk, a towering stack of medical charts, and a scattering of colourful therapy aids, it felt more like a carefully organized battlefield than a sanctuary.  The scent of antiseptic clung to the air, a perpetual reminder of the fragility of the human body and the relentless march of healing, or in some cases, the painful and stubbornly lingering absence of it.  Outside, the grey sky mirrored the overcast mood of the entire building. The biting wind howled a mournful tune, an accompaniment to the muted sobs that occasionally wafted from the adjacent therapy rooms, the quiet shrieks of frustration and the subdued coughs and groans of the patients.  Today, the unspoken tension in the air felt thicker than the rain-streaked glass.
