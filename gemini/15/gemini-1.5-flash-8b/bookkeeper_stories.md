The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Counting Crows" accounting firm hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Elara Nightingaleâ€™s meticulous life.  Paper, piled high like a miniature Everest, surrounded her.  Rows of numbers, meticulously penned in black ink, stretched across endless sheets of ledger paper.  The air, thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, clung to her like a second skin.  Elara, a bookkeeper for the past seven years, loved the quiet precision of balancing ledgers, of making sure every decimal point found its rightful place.  But tonight, the usual rhythm felt off-key, the familiar symphony of numbers discordant.

The office, located on the third floor of a nondescript brick building on the outskirts of Oakhaven, was a monument to beige.  Empty, stale-air-filled cubicles lined the walls.  The only splashes of colour came from the faded posters advertising free seminars on tax optimization and the occasional stray, dusty potted plant.  A faint aroma of cinnamon from a nearby bakery hung heavy in the stale air, a cruel reminder of the outside world Elara felt trapped within.  Rain hammered against the windowpanes, mirroring the frantic drumbeat of thoughts in her head.
