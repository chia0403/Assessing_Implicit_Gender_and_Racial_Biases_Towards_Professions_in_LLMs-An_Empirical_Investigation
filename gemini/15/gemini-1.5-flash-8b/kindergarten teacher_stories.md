The chipped paint of the classroom walls, a faded coral that screamed "optimism" in a way only a decade-old, kindergarten classroom could, contrasted sharply with the vibrant colours of the artwork scattered across the room.  Miss Amelia Blackwood, a woman whose auburn hair, usually pulled back in a practical ponytail, today cascaded around her shoulders in unruly waves, stared at the chaotic masterpiece: a collective mural depicting a fantastical forest filled with purple squirrels and rainbow trees.  It was, she knew, a masterpiece of pure, unadulterated imagination.  A testament to the boundless potential she, as their teacher, had the privilege of nurturing.

The setting was Miss Blackwood's kindergarten classroom at Oakhaven Elementary School, a building that stood a little too proud on a slightly too-flat stretch of land, just outside a town with a surprising number of antique shops and an even more surprising number of particularly stubborn oak trees.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun filtering through the slightly dusty windowpanes, illuminating a scattering of colourful blocks, and the soft murmur of children's voices, a symphony of whispers and shrieks, punctuated the quiet hum of the fluorescent lights.  Today, the usual energy felt amplified, charged by an unexpected and, perhaps, slightly unsettling stillness.
