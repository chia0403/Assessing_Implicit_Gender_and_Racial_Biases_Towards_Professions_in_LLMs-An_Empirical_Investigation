Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the small, ramshackle cottage, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic rhythm of Amelia Blackwoodâ€™s thoughts.  The year was 1937.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the gloom, illuminating a swirling vortex of papers, ink-stained fingers, and half-eaten biscuits.  Amelia Blackwood, author of *Whispers in the Willowbrook Woods*, a collection of gothic tales that had barely stirred the literary world, sat hunched over her battered typewriter, the rhythmic clacking a desperate attempt to silence the cacophony within.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful dirge, mirroring the despair that threatened to consume her.  She was in the small village of Ashwood, nestled deep within the whispering forests of the Cotswolds, a place that seemed to breathe a melancholy atmosphere that only deepened her despair.  The air, heavy with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, clung to her like a shroud, a fitting backdrop to the suffocating weight of her writer's block.  Amelia desperately needed inspiration, a glimmer of hope, a story to break free from the oppressive gloom.
