The flickering fluorescent lights of the waiting room hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic click-clack of Dr. Eleanor Vance's heels against the linoleum floor.  The scent of antiseptic, always present in the sterile air of the clinic, mingled with the faint, metallic tang of fear.  Eleanor, a clinical psychologist with ten years of experience, adjusted her glasses, the faint reflection catching a glint of the worn leather-bound journal nestled in her bag.  Today's patient, a Mr. Arthur Finch, was scheduled for their second session, a crucial one after the disconcerting revelations that had surfaced in their last meeting.

The waiting room was a stark white box, the furniture – uncomfortable vinyl chairs and a single, overly-polished wooden table – serving as stark reminders of the anxieties contained within its walls.  Sunlight, filtered through the grime-coated windows, cast long, uneven shadows that danced with the dust motes swirling in the air.  A chipped ceramic vase, once filled with a forgotten bouquet, sat forlornly on the table, a silent testament to the emotional fragility of the people who passed through these doors.  The walls, though painted a calming, beige, were strangely echoing.  It was a space designed for neutrality, but it often felt claustrophobic, trapping the anxieties and fears of its visitors like flies in a jar.
