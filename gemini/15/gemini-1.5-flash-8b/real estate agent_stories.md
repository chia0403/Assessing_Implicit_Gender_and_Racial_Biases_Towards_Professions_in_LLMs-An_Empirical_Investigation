The relentless September sun beat down on the dusty, cracked asphalt of Elm Street, shimmering like a heat mirage.  Dust motes danced in the air, swirling around Amelia "Amy"  Hawthorne, as she navigated the narrow, overgrown lane leading to the dilapidated Victorian house.  The peeling paint on the gingerbread trim, once a vibrant crimson, was now a faded, ghostly hue, mirroring the weariness settling in Amy's own chest.  This was her tenth showing of the day, and each one had been equally underwhelming.  The market was sluggish, the whispers of recession echoing in the hollow spaces between potential buyers.

The house, a sprawling, three-story monstrosity with a suspiciously large number of boarded-up windows,  stood as a testament to the neighborhood's struggles.  Ivy, thick as a forest, had reclaimed parts of the house's facade, clinging to the decaying brick like a grasping hand.  Amy, a seasoned real estate agent with a practiced smile and a heart heavy with the weight of unpaid mortgages and falling prices, adjusted her worn leather satchel and took a deep breath.  This particular listing – the Blackwood Manor – had been a particularly troublesome one.   Every potential buyer had been turned off by its overgrown condition, its grim history rumored to be steeped in local tragedy.
