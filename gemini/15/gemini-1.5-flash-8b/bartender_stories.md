The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow over Amelia Blackwood's worn, patched apron.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of moonlight slicing through the grime-coated window, illuminating the chipped porcelain of a half-finished mug on the counter.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless rhythm that mirrored the frantic drumming in Amelia's temples.

Tonight, even those were scarce.  Amelia, a bartender of ten years in the fading port city, stared into the empty space before her, the stillness amplifying the hum of the city's distant heartbeat.  Riverport, once a bustling hub of commerce, now whispered tales of decline with every gust of wind.
