The biting wind whipped across the parched fields of the Sunstone Valley, carrying with it the scent of dust and something acrid, something akin to burnt sugar.  Elara Blackwood, her face weathered like the cracked earth beneath her worn boots, hunched deeper into her threadbare wool coat.  The sun, a malevolent eye peering through the swirling clouds, cast long, skeletal shadows across the abandoned furrows.  This was the harvest of 1407, and it was a failure.  A catastrophic, heart-wrenching failure.

The Sunstone Valley, once a vibrant tapestry of golden wheat and emerald barley, now lay withered and grey.  Dust devils danced across the cracked earth, mocking the desperate farmers who trudged through the desolate landscape.  The once-fertile river, the lifeblood of the valley, was a mere trickle, barely enough to turn the watermills, much less sustain the crops.  A creeping drought, unseen by any man and unheard of by ancient prophecy, had descended upon the land, leaving the valley choked and helpless. Elara, her family's small farm nestled precariously on the eastern edge of the valley, felt the weight of the failing harvest as a crushing stone upon her soul.  The whispers of famine had begun, and the air crackled with an unsettling energy, as palpable as the relentless heat.
