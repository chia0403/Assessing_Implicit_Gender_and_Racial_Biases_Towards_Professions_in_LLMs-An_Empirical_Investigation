The fluorescent lights of the drafting room hummed, a relentless drone that seeped into Elias Thorne's very bones.  He hunched over his drafting table, the T-square a familiar weight in his hand, the pencil lead biting into the crisp tracing paper.  Outside, the city thrummed with a life he rarely participated in.  His world was contained within the four walls of the cramped, airless room, filled with the faint smell of old ink and the low murmur of fellow draftsmen, a symphony of click-clacking compasses and the rhythmic rustle of paper.

Elias Thorne, 32, a drafting worker for the sprawling Zenith Construction Company, was a creature of precise lines and calculated angles.  He translated the architect's sketches, the blueprints' cryptic symbols, into tangible realities: bridges that spanned chasms, skyscrapers that pierced the sky, the very infrastructure of the metropolis. His meticulousness, bordering on obsessive, was a key component of his job, a requirement for the intricate, sometimes fragile, structures he was responsible for.  But the relentless rhythm of the drafts and calculations, the endless repetition of lines and measurements, often felt like a cage.  Tonight, it felt particularly suffocating. A tremor ran through the building, not a major earthquake, more like the shuddering breath of a gigantic beast.  He paused, the pencil suspended mid-air, wondering if the old building itself was finally ready to surrender.
