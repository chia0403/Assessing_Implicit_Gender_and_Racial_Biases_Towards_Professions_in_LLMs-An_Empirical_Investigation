The fluorescent lights of the Metropolitan Museum of Art hummed, a relentless, almost sinister, soundtrack to Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's nightly routine.  Dust motes danced in the pale glow, illuminated by the single spotlight aimed at the overflowing porcelain sink in the staff restroom. Barty, a man whose age was a well-kept secret, expertly maneuvered a cleaning cart, a small mountain of supplies in its cargo net.  He was, by day, the unassuming janitor; by night, he was...something else entirely.  The museum, a vast, echoing labyrinth of history and artistry, held secrets that whispered to him in the stillness of the night. This particular night, however, held a different kind of whisper â€“ a chilling, metallic echo that resonated from the bowels of the museum, far from the polished floors and pristine exhibits.
