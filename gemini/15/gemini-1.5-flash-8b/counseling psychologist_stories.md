Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the small, cluttered office, a relentless percussion mirroring the tempest brewing inside Dr. Amelia Hayes.  The scent of damp earth and mildew clung to the air, mingling with the faint aroma of burnt coffee.  Amelia, a counseling psychologist with ten years of experience, hunched over her cluttered desk, the fluorescent light flickering erratically.  Empty takeout containers, crumpled papers, and half-filled mugs lay scattered around her like fallen leaves in a November storm.  Her well-worn leather armchair, positioned in a corner bathed in a sickly yellow glow, seemed to absorb the gloom.

The setting was the small town of Havenwood, nestled deep within the Appalachian Mountains.  The town, clinging to the side of a steep valley, was a patchwork of weathered houses and creaking storefronts, each bearing the quiet scars of time and hardship.  The air, thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, carried the whispers of generations past – whispers of resilience, of struggle, and of the unspoken burdens that weighed heavily on its inhabitants. Havenwood's sole claim to fame was the annual “Gathering of the Pines,” a quirky festival celebrating the local folklore. But even the Gatherings’ boisterous energy couldn't always chase away the persistent shadows that lingered within these mountain walls.  Today, those shadows felt especially thick.
