He was a man built like a weathered oak, broad shoulders and strong hands, honed by years spent wielding knives and coaxing perfection from the freshest catches of the day.  Tonight, however, a particular note of tension hung in the air, heavier than the steam rising from the simmering bouillabaisse.
