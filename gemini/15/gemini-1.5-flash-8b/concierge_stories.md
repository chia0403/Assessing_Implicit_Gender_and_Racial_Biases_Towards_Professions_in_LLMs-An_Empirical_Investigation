The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual, melancholic grey, reflected the flickering neon sign of the "Grand Imperial Hotel."  Rain hammered against the double-paned windows, a relentless percussion that drowned out the murmur of the city outside.  Agnes Periwinkle, a concierge of the Grand Imperial with a perpetually surprised expression, stared at the half-eaten croissant on the counter.  It was nearly midnight, and the only other soul in the entire hotel seemed to be the disgruntled ghost of a forgotten bellhop.  Agnes, or "Agnes the Amazing," as the favoured few called her, sighed. Another quiet night.  Another opportunity for somethingâ€¦ extraordinary.


The Grand Imperial, a relic of a bygone era, stood majestically, or at least that's how it presented itself to the oblivious tourist.  Its grandeur was a facade, a carefully constructed illusion.  The opulent chandeliers, once shimmering with crystal brilliance, now struggled to illuminate the dust motes dancing in the beams.  Water stains marked the peeling paint in the grand ballroom, a testament to past lavish parties and the inevitable march of time.  The faded velvet curtains of the presidential suite whispered tales of whispered secrets and clandestine meetings long forgotten.  But despite the hotel's crumbling facade, it held a certain magic, a silent promise of untold stories, waiting to be unearthed.  Agnes, with her weary eyes and uncanny ability to find the hidden threads in the fabric of the hotel, was the custodian of those stories.
