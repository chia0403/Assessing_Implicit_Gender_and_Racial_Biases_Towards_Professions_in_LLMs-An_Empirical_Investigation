The fluorescent lights of the "Tax Relief Express" hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia Kensington's workday.  Sheets of paper, each a testament to the complexities of American finances, littered her desk.  W-2s, 1099s, schedules C, D, and E â€“ they all blurred together in a chaotic dance of numbers.  Amelia, a meticulous tax preparer with a sharp eye for detail and an even sharper wit, was meticulously going through the latest batch of paperwork.  Outside her small office, in the bustling heart of downtown Springfield, the city was waking up, but inside, Amelia's world was a quiet symphony of clicking keys and the low murmur of her thoughts.  The year was 2024.  Springfield, Missouri, a mid-sized American city with a population that largely consisted of  small business owners, farmers, and employees of the local manufacturing plants,  was buzzing with a mix of anticipation and anxiety as the tax filing season kicked into high gear.  Amelia was a familiar figure in the tiny storefront office of Tax Relief Express, a place where the aroma of stale coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air for the next few months.
