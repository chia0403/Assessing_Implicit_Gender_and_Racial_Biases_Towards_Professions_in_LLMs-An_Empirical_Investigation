The Himalayan salt lamp cast a warm, apricot glow across the Serenity Now Massage Therapy studio, illuminating dust motes dancing in the still air.  Rain lashed against the large bay window, the rhythmic drumming a soothing counterpoint to the gentle gurgle of the small fountain nestled amongst the peace lilies in the corner.  Eliza Jane Cartwright, her hands still faintly scented with lavender and bergamot from the previous client, glanced at the clock: 7:58 pm.  Two minutes until her last appointment of the day.  Outside, the wind howled through the narrow streets of Port Blossom, Oregon, a quaint coastal town known more for its tempestuous weather than its tranquility.  Eliza hoped her final client, a new booking, wouldn't be deterred by the storm.
