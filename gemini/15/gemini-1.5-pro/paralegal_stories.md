The flickering fluorescent lights of the Kressler & Blake law offices buzzed like trapped insects, a soundtrack Amelia Reyes had grown accustomed to over her five years as a paralegal. Outside, the Chicago wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the aging windows of the fifteenth-floor office.  It was a Friday night, pushing 9 pm, and the city lights glittered below like a spilled box of sequins. Amelia, her dark hair pulled back in a messy bun, hunched over a mountain of discovery documents related to the Peterson vs. City of Chicago case, a seemingly endless tangle of zoning permits, environmental impact reports, and sworn affidavits.  The air smelled faintly of stale coffee and the lemon-scented cleaner the night crew used, a perfume sheâ€™d come to associate with late nights and looming deadlines.  Everyone else had gone home hours ago, leaving Amelia alone in the cavernous, silent office, the only illumination coming from her desk lamp and the ghostly glow of the city beyond. The silence, usually a welcome reprieve, tonight held a strange, unsettling edge.
