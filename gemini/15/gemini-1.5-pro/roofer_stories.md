The tar hissed and bubbled under the August sun, the smell thick enough to coat the back of Elias Finch’s throat.  He knelt on the scorching shingles of Mrs. Henderson’s Victorian, the slate-grey peaks of the Widow’s Walk looming over him like a disapproving matron.  Dust motes danced in the shimmering heat haze rising from the terracotta rooftops of Port Blossom, Oregon, a small coastal town nestled between the forested slopes of the Coastal Range and the churning grey expanse of the Pacific.  A salty breeze, usually a welcome respite in the summer heat, did little to cut through the oppressive humidity this afternoon. Elias wiped a bead of sweat from his brow with the back of his calloused hand, leaving a streak of black tar across his weathered skin. Below him, the town sprawled out like a haphazardly tossed handful of colourful pebbles, its life continuing oblivious to the precarious perch of the solitary figure on the roof. He had a clear view of the bustling fishing docks, the quaint storefronts lining Main Street, and the white-capped waves crashing against the rocky shoreline. But Elias wasn't looking at the view. He was focused on the small, almost invisible crack in the flashing around Mrs. Henderson's chimney, a crack that threatened to unleash a torrent of water into her antique-filled attic with the next autumn rain.  He knew, with a certainty born from years of experience, that this seemingly insignificant flaw held the potential for disaster.
