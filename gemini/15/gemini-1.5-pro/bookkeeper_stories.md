A single gas lamp hissed softly above her head, illuminating the ledger open before her. The neat columns of figures, meticulously inscribed in Ameliaâ€™s precise hand, told the story of a district teetering on the edge of poverty and desperation, a story far more complex than the simple debits and credits that filled her pages.
