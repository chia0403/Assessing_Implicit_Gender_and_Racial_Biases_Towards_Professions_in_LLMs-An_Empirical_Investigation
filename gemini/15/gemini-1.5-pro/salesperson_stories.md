Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the "Rest-A-While" diner, blurring the neon sign's flickering promise of comfort. Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of stale coffee and frying onions. Cassandra "Cassie" Bellweather, her sales brochures clutched tight in one hand and a lukewarm cup of coffee in the other, watched the downpour with a grimace.

Harmony Springs, population 842, wasn't exactly a hotbed of demand for the state-of-the-art irrigation systems Cassie was peddling.  Her powder-blue suit, usually her armour of confidence, felt damp and heavy, mirroring her spirits. She had three more farms on her list for the day, and if she didn't close at least one deal, her meticulously crafted sales pitch, honed over years of rejection and triumph, would have been wasted on a town that seemed more interested in surviving the next flood than investing in preventing the next drought.
