The fluorescent lights of St. Jude's Hospital hummed a monotonous B flat, a soundtrack Amelia Reyes had grown accustomed to over her five years as a phlebotomist. It was 6:45 am, the pre-dawn quiet broken only by the rhythmic squeak of her rubber-soled shoes against the polished linoleum. Outside, a bruised, indigo sky hinted at the coming sunrise, but within the sterile walls of the phlebotomy lab, it was perpetually twilight.  Amelia, her name tag pinned neatly to her crisp, cornflower-blue scrubs, meticulously arranged her tray: tourniquets, vacutainers, alcohol swabs, butterfly needles, all laid out with a precision born from routine and a deep respect for the delicate dance between her and the veins she sought. This morning, however, a peculiar tension hung in the air, a static charge that prickled Amelia's skin and made the fine hairs on her arms stand on end. It wasn't just the usual Monday morning dread; something felt different, off-kilter.  The feeling intensified as the elevator doors hissed open, revealing a gurney bearing a figure draped in white sheets, their face obscured.  A hush fell over the normally bustling lab.
