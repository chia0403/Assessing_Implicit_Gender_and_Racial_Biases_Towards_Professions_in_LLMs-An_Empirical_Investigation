The insistent Vermont wind rattled the stained-glass window depicting a rather cheerful molar, a jarring counterpoint to the tension coiling in Dr. Elias Thorne’s stomach.  His dental practice, nestled in a converted Victorian house on Maple Street in the quaint town of Harmony Glade, usually filled him with a sense of peaceful accomplishment.  This Tuesday morning, however, the familiar scent of antiseptic and the gentle whir of the polishing tool in the next room did little to soothe his unease.  The sky outside was a bruised purple, promising snow, and Elias had the distinct feeling that more than just the weather was about to turn foul.  He glanced at the antique clock ticking above the fireplace in his office – 10:57 am. Three minutes until Mrs. Abernathy, Harmony Glade’s resident gossip and purveyor of cryptic pronouncements, arrived for her biannual cleaning. Elias knew, with a certainty that had nothing to do with dentistry, that whatever she had to say would change everything.
