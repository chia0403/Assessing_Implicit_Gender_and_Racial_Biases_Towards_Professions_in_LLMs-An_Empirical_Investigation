The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne's dark hair across her face as she hurried across the deserted parking lot of St. Jude's Memorial Hospital. The flickering sodium vapor lamps cast long, skeletal shadows that danced with her every step.  Above, the sky was a bruised purple, hinting at the snowstorm predicted to hit the rural Maine town of Havenwood before dawn. Amelia pulled her thick wool coat tighter around her and dug her gloved hands deeper into her pockets, the chill already seeping through her scrubs. Tonight, her twelve-hour shift in the Emergency Room had stretched into fourteen, thanks to a multi-car pileup on the icy Route 17.  Exhaustion gnawed at her, a dull ache behind her eyes, but the thought of a warm fire and a cup of tea in her small cottage on the edge of town kept her moving.  St. Jude's, a squat, brick building, looked particularly ominous tonight, its windows glowing like vacant eyes in the deepening gloom.  The quiet, broken only by the rustling of dried leaves skittering across the asphalt, felt heavy, almost expectant.
