The wail of the siren was a lullaby to Amelia “Amy” Reyes.  It blended with the rhythmic thump of the tires against the cracked asphalt of Highway 1, the Pacific’s churning grey mirroring the churning in her stomach.  The salt spray kissed her face as the ambulance, Paramedic Unit 42, carved its way through the pre-dawn gloom.  Monterey County, California, usually a postcard of rugged beauty, was today a canvas of storm clouds and lashing rain.  Amy, her dark hair plastered to her forehead, gripped the grab bar above her head as they navigated a hairpin turn. The call had been terse: possible cliffside car accident, single occupant, unknown status.  The location: a treacherous stretch of highway known locally as “Devil’s Elbow.”  Amy knew the spot well.  It was a place where the beauty of Big Sur could turn deadly in an instant.
