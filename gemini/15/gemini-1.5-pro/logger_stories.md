The biting November wind howled through the skeletal branches of the pines, clawing at Elijah Jedediah Blackwood's thick flannel shirt as if trying to peel it from his broad back.  Frost crunched beneath his heavy boots, the sound sharp and brittle against the otherwise hushed pre-dawn of the Cascade Mountains.  Towering Douglas firs, their shaggy bark slick with icy rain, stood sentinel around him, their tops lost in a swirling mist that clung to the slopes of Mount Thielsen like a shroud.  Elijah, his breath clouding the air before him, adjusted the brim of his worn Stetson and surveyed the marked trees â€“ giants destined to become lumber, feeding the insatiable hunger of the mills down in the valley. This particular stand, nestled in a remote pocket known as Blackwood's Hollow (a name ironically bestowed not by Elijah, but by his grandfather, the first logger in the family to brave these unforgiving slopes), was his current battleground.  The air vibrated with the low hum of the generator powering the floodlights that illuminated the work area, starkly contrasting the encroaching darkness of the surrounding forest. This was Elijah's world, a place of ancient trees, biting cold, and the constant, thrumming presence of the saw.
