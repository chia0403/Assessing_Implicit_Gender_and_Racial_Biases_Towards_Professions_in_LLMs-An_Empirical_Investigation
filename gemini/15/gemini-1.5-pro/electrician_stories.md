The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of Wyoming, rattling the windows of the abandoned Sinclair gas station like skeletal fingers drumming a morbid tune. Inside, illuminated by the harsh glow of a single bare bulb hanging precariously from the ceiling, Amelia "Amy" Reyes shivered, her breath puffing out in small white clouds.  Her thick work boots crunched on shattered glass and grit as she surveyed the scene.  The air hung thick with the cloying sweetness of decaying wood and the metallic tang of rust. Amy, a licensed electrician with calloused hands and a gaze as sharp as her wire strippers, had been dispatched to this forgotten corner of the world to rewire the station as part of a bizarre roadside attraction revival project.  The developers, a group of eccentric millionaires with a penchant for the nostalgic, envisioned a retro haven for weary travelers, complete with a functioning diner and a vintage jukebox.  Amy, however, wasn't convinced anyone in their right mind would venture this far off the beaten path, let alone stop for a burger and a shake.  But a job was a job, and the pay was good enough to justify braving the eerie silence and the unsettling feeling of being watched.
