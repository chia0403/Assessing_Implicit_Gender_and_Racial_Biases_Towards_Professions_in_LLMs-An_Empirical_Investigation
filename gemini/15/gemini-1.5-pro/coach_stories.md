The biting November wind whipped across the cracked asphalt of the parking lot, swirling fallen leaves into miniature tornadoes around Coach Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez's ankles.  Floodlights cast a sickly yellow glow over the deserted bleachers of Bradley High's football field, illuminating the patches of frost clinging to the unmowed grass. Amy pulled her threadbare Cardinals jacket tighter around herself, the damp chill seeping through to her bones despite the layers she wore.  The metallic tang of approaching snow hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the usual dusty, dry smell of late autumn in West Texas. She sighed, a plume of white escaping her lips and vanishing into the darkness.  Another late night, another empty field.  She wasn't sure how much longer she could keep this up.
