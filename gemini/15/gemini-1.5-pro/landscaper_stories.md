Frost crunched under her boots as she moved along the perimeter of the Blackwood Estate, its imposing Tudor facade looming behind her like a grey giant.  The sprawling grounds, usually vibrant with meticulously arranged blooms, were now subdued, a tapestry of browns and greys, punctuated by the occasional evergreen. Mia exhaled, a puff of white momentarily obscuring her view of the wrought iron gates that marked the entrance to the property.

The air hung heavy with a sense of secrets, a feeling amplified by the near-constant mist that clung to the valley where the Blackwood Estate lay nestled, hidden from the prying eyes of the nearby village of Oakhaven.
