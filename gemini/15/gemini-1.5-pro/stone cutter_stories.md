The wind, sharp and cold as a freshly honed chisel, whipped across the desolate plateau, biting at Elias Thorne's exposed cheeks. He hunched deeper into his thick woolen cloak, the rough fabric scratching against the calluses that mapped his hands. Around him, the landscape of the Whispering Cliffs stretched, a vast, grey expanse of jagged rock formations and wind-carved canyons.  The sky, a bruised purple, threatened snow.  Elias, his breath clouding in the frigid air, surveyed the cliff face before him, his gaze searching for the vein of rose quartz he’d tracked for the past three days.  It was a precarious climb, even for a seasoned climber like himself, but the reward - a vein of quartz the colour of a lover’s blush - was worth the risk. The village of Stonehollow, nestled in the valley below, relied on the stones he brought down, and this winter had been particularly harsh. They needed the coin this rare find would bring. He adjusted the leather straps securing his tools, the familiar weight a comfort against the biting wind, and began his ascent.
