Rain lashed against the arched windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's office, each drop a tiny percussionist in a symphony of November gloom.  His mahogany desk, usually a beacon of order in his otherwise cluttered space, was awash in the soft glow of a Tiffany lamp, casting long shadows across the Persian rug.  Outside, the Chicago skyline was a hazy blur of grey and steel, the lights of the Magnificent Mile twinkling faintly through the downpour.  Elias, his tie loosened and his brow furrowed in concentration, tapped a pen against his teeth, the rhythmic click a counterpoint to the relentless rain. He was reviewing the file of his newest patient, a woman named Seraphina Bellweather, whose case history read like a gothic novel â€“ a troubled childhood, a string of broken relationships, and a chillingly vague description of recurring nightmares that left her screaming in the dead of night.  He had a feeling this case would be unlike any other.
