The sterile scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Elara Grace Holloway.  Fluorescent lights hummed above, reflecting off the polished chrome of the dental instruments laid out with meticulous precision on the tray beside her.  Outside, the November wind howled against the large picture window of Dr. Albright’s Family Dentistry, rattling the frosted glass depicting a cartoon tooth winking cheerfully.  The view, normally a calming panorama of the sleepy town of Oakhaven, nestled amidst the rolling hills of the Vermont countryside, was today obscured by a swirling blizzard that had descended with surprising ferocity.  Elara glanced at the clock – 2:47 pm.  Only one more patient scheduled for the day, and then she could escape the biting wind and curl up with a good book and a steaming mug of hot chocolate.  Little did she know, the last patient of the day was about to bring a blizzard of a different kind into her quiet, ordered life.
