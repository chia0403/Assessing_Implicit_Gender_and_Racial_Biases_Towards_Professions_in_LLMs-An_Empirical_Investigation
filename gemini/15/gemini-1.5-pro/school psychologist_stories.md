The fluorescent lights of McKinley Elementary hummed a monotonous B flat, a counterpoint to the cacophony of childrenâ€™s voices echoing through the tiled hallway.  Rain lashed against the tall windows at the end of the corridor, blurring the already grey November landscape of Syracuse, New York.  Dr. Eleanor Vance, the school psychologist, shivered despite the thick wool of her cardigan.  She watched the children file back into their classrooms after recess, their bright raincoats a fleeting kaleidoscope against the institutional beige. A crumpled drawing of a rainbow with disproportionately long legs lay abandoned near the water fountain, and Eleanor stooped to pick it up, a faint smile touching her lips.  This was her favorite time of day, the quiet after the storm, both literal and metaphorical.  It was in these small moments, amidst the chaos and clamor of elementary school life, that Eleanor felt she could truly make a difference. Little did she know, this particular Tuesday would prove to be anything but ordinary.
