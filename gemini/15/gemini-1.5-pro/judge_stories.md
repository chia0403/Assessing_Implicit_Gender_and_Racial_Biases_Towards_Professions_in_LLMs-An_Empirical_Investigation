The mahogany desk, polished to a mirror sheen, reflected the flickering gaslight back into Judge Elias Thorne’s weary eyes. Rain lashed against the tall windows of his chambers, mirroring the tempest brewing inside him.  It was late, well past midnight, and the courthouse of Ashtonbury, normally a bustling hub of activity, was silent except for the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner and the incessant drumming of the rain.  Ashtonbury, nestled deep in the Appalachian Mountains, was a town steeped in its own peculiar brand of justice – a blend of old-world traditions and harsh realities dictated by the unforgiving terrain.  Tonight, however, the usual mountain stillness was laced with an unnatural tension, a premonition that hung heavy in the air like the scent of woodsmoke after a wildfire.  Judge Thorne knew, with a certainty that settled deep in his bones, that this storm was more than just meteorological.  Something wicked was coming to Ashtonbury.
