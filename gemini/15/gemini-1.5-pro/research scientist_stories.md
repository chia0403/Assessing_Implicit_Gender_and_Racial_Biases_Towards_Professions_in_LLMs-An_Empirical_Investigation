The biting Antarctic wind whipped at Dr. Aris Thorne's parka, stinging his exposed cheeks despite the thick layers of thermal protection.  He squinted, his breath fogging his goggles as he surveyed the desolate landscape.  Towering ice cliffs, sculpted by millennia of wind and snow, loomed over the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, a cluster of prefabricated buildings clinging to the high polar plateau. Inside the station's heated confines, the hum of generators and the murmur of human activity provided a stark contrast to the utter silence of the icy wilderness just beyond the airlock. It was January 2042, and for Aris, six months into his year-long research posting studying anomalous neutrino oscillations detected deep beneath the ice, the isolation was beginning to feel less like a scientific adventure and more like a sentence.  The vibrant aurora australis painting the night sky in ethereal hues was no longer a source of wonder, but a constant reminder of the vast, indifferent expanse that separated him from the rest of the world.  He adjusted his grip on the metallic cylinder containing the latest ice core samples, a shiver running down his spine unrelated to the cold.  Something felt wrong, different.  The usual low hum of the neutrino detector, usually audible even from outside, was absent.
