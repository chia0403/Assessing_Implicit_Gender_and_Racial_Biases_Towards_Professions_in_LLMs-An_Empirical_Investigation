The clatter of a dropped saucepan echoed through the otherwise silent kitchen of "Le Papillon Bleu," a small, yet ambitious, French bistro tucked away on a cobbled side street in the Marais district of Paris.  Rain lashed against the windows, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Chef Antoine Moreau.  Antoine, his full name Antoine Claude Moreau, ran a hand through his already disheveled dark hair.  It was 3:00 am, hours before the morning delivery and a lifetime before the lunch rush, yet sleep was a distant, unattainable luxury.  He stared into the simmering pot of veal stock, its fragrant steam a poor substitute for the inspiration he desperately craved.  His signature dish, a delicate Blanquette de Veau, had become stale, predictable, a pale imitation of the culinary masterpiece he'd envisioned. Tonight, with the city asleep and the rhythmic drumming of the rain as his only companion, Antoine was determined to rediscover the magic, to rekindle the spark that had once made him the most talked-about young chef in Paris.
