The rusty scissors, lovingly nicknamed Snippy by Elias Thorne, whispered against his thumb as he surveyed the quiet, snow-dusted street outside.  Eliasâ€™ Barbershop, a compact space nestled between Mrs. Higgins' perpetually overflowing flower shop and O'Malley's dimly lit pub in the heart of Aisling, Vermont, was usually abuzz with the chatter of locals by this hour. But not today. A thick blanket of early November snow had fallen overnight, transforming the usually bustling village into a hushed, monochrome landscape. The only sound was the faint chime of the shop bell as Elias opened the door, a puff of warm, cinnamon-scented air escaping into the crisp morning.  Inside, the antique barber chairs sat empty, their worn leather gleaming under the warm glow of the Edison bulbs that Elias insisted on using.  He tapped Snippy against the palm of his hand, a nervous habit he'd picked up during quieter times, and wondered if anyone would brave the snow for a trim today.
