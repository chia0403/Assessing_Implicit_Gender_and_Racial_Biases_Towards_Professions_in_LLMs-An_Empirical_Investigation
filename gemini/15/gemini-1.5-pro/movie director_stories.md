The biting Santa Ana winds whipped through the canyons, rattling the eucalyptus trees outside Valeria "Val" Reyes's modernist glass house.  The sprawling city of Los Angeles glittered below, a tapestry of lights stretching from the silver curve of the Pacific to the hazy inland mountains. Inside, the scene was considerably less glamorous. Val, her full name Valeria Isabella Reyes, sat hunched over a storyboard, a half-eaten container of pad thai and a rapidly cooling cup of coffee her only companions.  The storyboard, meticulously crafted with thumbnail sketches and handwritten notes, depicted a tense chase scene through the labyrinthine corridors of a soon-to-be-demolished art deco hotel. This was the climax of "Neon Shadows," Val's ambitious neo-noir thriller, and it was proving to be as elusive and frustrating as the film's femme fatale protagonist.  Three weeks into principal photography, the shoot was already behind schedule and over budget, the studio breathing down her neck, and her lead actor threatening to walk. The pressure was a physical weight, settling in her chest like a lead vest.  Val knew she needed a breakthrough, and she needed it fast.  The relentless Santa Anas howled outside, a soundtrack to her mounting anxiety.
