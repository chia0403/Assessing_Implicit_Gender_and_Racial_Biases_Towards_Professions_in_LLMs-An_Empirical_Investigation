The biting November wind howled down Grimshaw Lane, rattling the frosted panes of Elias Finch's tailoring shop.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of wool and beeswax, a comforting aroma that did little to dispel the chill that permeated the aged brick walls. Elias, his spectacles perched precariously on his nose, meticulously stitched the final button onto a heavy tweed coat, his needle flashing in the dim light of the single gas lamp that hissed overhead.  The shop, nestled between a butcher's and a dimly lit pub in the heart of Whitechapel, London, was small and cluttered, rolls of fabric spilling from shelves, half-finished garments draped over mannequins, and pattern books stacked haphazardly on every available surface.  Outside, the fog, thick as pea soup, began to roll in, swallowing the cobbled street and muffling the distant cries of street vendors.  It was a night for staying indoors, a night for stories, a night, Elias felt with a prickle of unease, for strange happenings.
