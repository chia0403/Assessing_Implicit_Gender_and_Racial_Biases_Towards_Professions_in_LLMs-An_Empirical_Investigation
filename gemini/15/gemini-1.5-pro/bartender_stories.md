The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of The Rusty Mug, a rhythm Amelia “Amy” Hawthorne had come to find oddly comforting.  Nestled between a perpetually closed pawn shop and a laundromat that smelled vaguely of burnt toast, The Rusty Mug wasn't much to look at.  Its neon sign, flickering intermittently, cast a sickly green glow over the rain-slicked street in the forgotten corner of Port Blossom, Oregon.  Inside, the air was thick with the smell of stale beer, cheap whiskey, and regret. Amy, her name embroidered in faded gold script on her black apron, wiped down the sticky mahogany bar with a practiced hand, her dark eyes reflecting the dim light of the single working lamp above the cash register.  It was a Tuesday night, the slowest night of the week, and the only other occupant of the bar was a snoring fisherman slumped in a corner booth, a half-eaten bowl of peanuts at his elbow.  Outside, the wind howled, a mournful sound that seemed to echo the secrets whispered within the dimly lit confines of The Rusty Mug.
