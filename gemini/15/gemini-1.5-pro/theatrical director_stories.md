The biting November wind whipped around Esmeralda "Esme" Cartwright, swirling fallen leaves into miniature tornadoes across the cobbled alleyway.  The damp chill seeped through the layers of her worn tweed coat as she fumbled with the key to the stage door of the dilapidated Grand Majestic Theatre.

Its ornate facade, featuring peeling cherubs and chipped goddesses, hinted at a glorious past, a past Esme desperately hoped to resurrect.  Tonight was the opening night of her ambitious, modern reimagining of Shakespeare’s *A Midsummer Night’s Dream*, a production she'd poured her heart and soul, not to mention her meagre savings, into. The fate of the theatre, and perhaps Esme’s own future, rested on its success.  Above the groaning stage door, a single, flickering bulb cast an eerie, theatrical glow, illuminating the faded gold lettering proclaiming the theatre's name – a name that now felt more like a wistful aspiration than a statement of fact.
