The relentless London drizzle seemed to mirror the grey mood swirling inside Amelia "Mia" Cartwright.  Her flat, tucked away in a mews just off Portobello Road, usually vibrated with colour – canvases leaning against walls splashed with acrylics, sketchbooks overflowing with vibrant marker pen designs, and her iMac glowing with half-finished projects. But today, a dull, oppressive quiet had settled over everything.  The remnants of a takeaway curry sat congealing on the coffee table, a testament to a Friday night spent staring at a blank screen, the cursor blinking mockingly at Mia as if challenging her creative drought. Outside, the Saturday morning market was starting to come alive, the murmur of bartering and the aroma of street food drifting in through the open window, but even the usually invigorating buzz of Portobello failed to penetrate Mia's creative block.  This latest commission, a rebranding campaign for a trendy new gin distillery, felt like a lead weight in her stomach.  She’d doodled countless botanicals, experimented with Art Deco fonts, even tried to channel the roaring twenties through a series of flapper-inspired illustrations, but nothing felt right. Nothing sparked.  The deadline loomed, a menacing shadow lengthening with each tick of the clock.
