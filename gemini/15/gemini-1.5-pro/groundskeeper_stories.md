The biting November wind whipped around Elias Finch, tugging at the brim of his worn tweed cap and swirling fallen leaves into frenzied dervishes across the manicured lawns of Eventide Manor.  Frost crunched beneath his heavy boots, the sound a stark counterpoint to the rustle of dried oak leaves clinging precariously to their branches.  Eventide, a sprawling Victorian edifice of grey stone and leaded glass, loomed over him, its many windows reflecting the steely grey sky like a hundred watchful eyes.  Built on a windswept bluff overlooking the churning North Sea, the manor had stood for centuries, a silent witness to the changing tides and the secrets they carried ashore.  Elias, head groundskeeper for the past twenty years, knew every inch of the estate, from the meticulously pruned rose garden, a riot of thorns now bare for winter, to the shadowed pathways that snaked through the ancient woodland bordering the property. He had always found a strange solace in the predictable rhythm of the seasons, in the quiet communion with the earth. But this November morning felt different. A disquiet hung in the air, heavier than the approaching storm clouds gathering on the horizon.
