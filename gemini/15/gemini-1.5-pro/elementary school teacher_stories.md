The late afternoon sun, filtered through the dusty windows of Mrs. Eleanor Vance's third-grade classroom, cast long, distorted rectangles across the worn linoleum floor.  Tiny handprints, ghostly remnants of finger painting sessions long past, dotted the lower panes.  Abraham Lincoln Elementary, nestled in the sleepy, apple-orchard-laden town of Harmony Creek, Oregon, was usually a haven of childish laughter and the rhythmic squeak of sneakers on polished hallways. But at 4:45 pm on a Friday, only the faint hum of the ancient radiator and the rustling of papers on Mrs. Vance's desk punctuated the near silence. Outside, the crisp autumn air, scented with woodsmoke and decaying leaves, hinted at the approaching winter.  Eleanor, her auburn hair pulled back in a loose bun, sighed and rubbed the bridge of her nose, the faint indentations of her glasses still imprinted on her skin.  Another week gone.  Another stack of spelling tests to grade. And another lingering feeling that something in Harmony Creek wasn't quite right.
