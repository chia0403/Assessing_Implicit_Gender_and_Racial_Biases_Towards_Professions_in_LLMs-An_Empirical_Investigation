The biting wind whipped Amelia "Mia" Ramirez's thick, dark braid across her face as she trudged through the knee-high snowdrifts towards the wolf enclosure.  The Greystone Wildlife Sanctuary, nestled deep in the Adirondack Mountains of upstate New York, was a picture postcard of wintry beauty this morning, all frosted pines and glittering snowfields.  But Mia, bundled in layers of fleece and down, felt none of the picturesque charm. Her breath plumed out in frosty puffs, mirroring the anxious clouds of condensation escaping the panting jaws of Shadow, the Sanctuary's alpha female, who paced restlessly just beyond the reinforced fence.  The usually vibrant emerald green of Shadow's eyes was dulled, her normally proud posture slumped.  Something was wrong, and Mia, who knew every nuance of the packâ€™s behavior, could feel the unease radiating from the magnificent creature like the cold itself.
