The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne's dark hair across her face as she hurried across the cobbled courtyard of St. Jude's Community Hospital.  The ancient brick buildings, huddled together against the grey Norfolk sky, seemed to exude a damp chill that seeped right through her thick wool coat.  The salty tang of the nearby North Sea hung heavy in the air, a constant reminder of the isolated nature of the small coastal town of Cromer, where the hospital served as the solitary beacon of hope for miles around.  Amelia, or Amy as she preferred, pulled her stethoscope from her pocket and adjusted the collar of her crisp white lab coat, steeling herself for the long night shift ahead. The fluorescent lights spilling from the A&E entrance cast long, distorted shadows that danced across the courtyard stones, creating an unsettlingly theatrical scene.  Tonight, like most nights in Cromer, promised to be unpredictable.
