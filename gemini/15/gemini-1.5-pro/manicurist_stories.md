The chipped turquoise paint of the salon door chimed a discordant welcome as Elara Reyes pushed it open, a gust of acetone and hairspray swirling around her.  Elara’s Nail Nook wasn't much – a cramped space sandwiched between Mr. Kim's dry cleaners and a perpetually empty storefront in the sleepy town of Havenwood, Ohio. But it was hers.  Sunlight, weak from its struggle through the grime-streaked window, illuminated rows of glittering polish bottles, arranged like tiny jewels on the wall.  A worn, velvet-covered pedicure chair sat centre stage, its footrest scuffed from years of pampering weary feet. This Thursday morning, however, Havenwood seemed even sleepier than usual. The only sound besides the hum of the dusty air conditioner was the rhythmic tick-tock of the kitschy, cat-shaped clock that Elara’s grandmother had bequeathed her, its emerald eyes following her every move.
