The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, carrying the scent of stale beer and impending snow.  Neon signs flickered against the wet pavement of Clark Street, casting a lurid glow on the huddled figures waiting for the night bus.  Detective Isabella "Izzy" Diaz, her collar pulled high against the chill, shivered and pulled her worn leather gloves tighter.  It was 2:17 am, the kind of hour that swallowed sound and amplified shadows, the kind of hour when bad things happened in Chicago.  Across the street, the flashing blue and red lights of a squad car bathed the entrance of O'Malley's Pub in an unsettling strobe effect.  Something about the tableau – the two uniformed officers standing stiffly by the door, the hushed murmurs emanating from the crowd gathered on the sidewalk – told Izzy this was more than just a bar fight. This was the start of a long night.
