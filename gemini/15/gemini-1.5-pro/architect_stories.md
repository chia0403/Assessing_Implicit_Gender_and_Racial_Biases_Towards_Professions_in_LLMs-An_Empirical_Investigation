The biting November wind whipped around Cassandra "Cassie" Moreau, plastering strands of her auburn hair across her face as she surveyed the site.  Grey clouds, heavy with the threat of snow, pressed low over the dilapidated Victorian mansion.  Its ornate gingerbread trim, once a testament to the prosperity of a bygone era, now sagged and peeled like sunburnt skin. Broken stained-glass windows gaped like empty sockets, and the wraparound porch listed precariously, threatening to collapse into a heap of rotting timber.  This was Blackwood Manor, perched precariously on a windswept bluff overlooking the churning grey expanse of the Atlantic Ocean in the remote coastal town of Port Blossom, Maine.  Cassie, clad in a thick wool coat and sturdy boots, pulled her scarf tighter and exhaled, a plume of white vapor dissipating into the cold air. This was her latest project, a restoration that promised to be both challenging and rewarding.  Little did she know, Blackwood Manor held secrets far more intricate and unsettling than its crumbling facade.
