The scent of aging paper and lemon-polish hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma that Eleanor Vance breathed in deeply as she unlocked the heavy oak doors of the Whisperwood Public Library.  Nestled amidst the towering pines and sprawling maples of Whisperwood, Maine, the library was a haven of tranquility, a sanctuary from the biting November winds that howled just beyond its stained-glass windows.  Sunlight, pale and watery, filtered through the branches, dappling the worn Persian rugs that lined the hardwood floors.  Eleanor, her silver hair pinned neatly beneath a burgundy beret, adjusted her spectacles and surveyed her domain. Rows upon rows of books stood sentinel, their spines whispering stories yet untold. The quiet hum of the ancient radiator in the corner was the only sound, a low thrum that vibrated through the stillness.  This morning, however, held a different sort of quiet. A quiet that crackled with an almost palpable tension, a silence that felt pregnant with secrets.
