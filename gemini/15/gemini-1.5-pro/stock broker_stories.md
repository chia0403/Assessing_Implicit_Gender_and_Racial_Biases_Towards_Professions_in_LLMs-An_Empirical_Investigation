Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Elias Thorne’s thirty-second-floor office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside him.  The city lights of Chicago, usually a glittering tapestry below, were smeared into blurry streaks of gold and crimson. Elias, whose full name was Elias Vance Thorne III, ran a hand through his already disheveled dark hair. The mahogany desk, usually pristine, was littered with printouts – graphs dipping like wounded birds, financial reports stained with spilled coffee, and a half-eaten container of lo mein that spoke volumes about the hours he’d been putting in.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale takeout and the metallic tang of anxiety.  It was 4:57 AM, three minutes before the opening bell, and today, Elias wasn’t just playing the market; he was playing for his survival.
