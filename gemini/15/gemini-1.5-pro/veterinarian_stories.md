The biting wind whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne, stinging his cheeks and tugging at the edges of his thick tweed coat. He hunched deeper into the collar, his breath puffing out in white clouds against the darkening sky. Dusk was settling over the remote Scottish Highlands, painting the craggy peaks of Ben Cruachan in shades of violet and deep grey.  The only sound that pierced the howling wind was the rhythmic crunch of his boots on the gravel track leading to Ardlui Croft, a lonely farmhouse nestled deep within Glen Orchy. Elias hadn't expected a call out this late, especially not one so far out of the way. His clinic in the small village of Dalmally was supposed to be closed for the night, but when old Mrs. MacIntyre phoned, her voice laced with panic about her prize-winning Highland cow, he hadn't hesitated.  He knew how much Bessie meant to the elderly woman.  And besides, a veterinarian's work was never truly done.
