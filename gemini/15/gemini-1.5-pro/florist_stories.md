The bell above the door of "Petal & Stem" tinkled merrily, a counterpoint to the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of Eliza Jane Hawthorne’s shears.  Outside, the cobbled streets of Port Blossom, Maine, shimmered under a late April sun, the air thick with the promise of spring.  Inside, the air hummed with a different kind of magic, the scent of damp earth, freshly cut lilies, and the subtly sweet perfume Eliza always wore – a blend of lilac and sandalwood.  Eliza, a wisp of a woman with eyes the color of forget-me-nots and a perpetually smudged streak of dirt on her cheek, was coaxing a stubborn spray of forsythia into submission.  She hadn't noticed the customer yet, too absorbed in her task, her brow furrowed in concentration. The shop, crammed with buckets of blooms in every imaginable shade, from the palest blush pink to the deepest midnight purple, felt more like a vibrant, fragrant garden than a store. Sunlight streamed through the large front windows, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the air and painting rainbows across the polished wooden floor.
