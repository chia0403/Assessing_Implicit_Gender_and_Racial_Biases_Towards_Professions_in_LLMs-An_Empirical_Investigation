The chill of a November rain slicked the cobblestones of Rue Cler, reflecting the warm glow emanating from the lobby of Le Petit Chateau, a boutique hotel tucked away in Paris's 7th arrondissement.  Inside,  Genevieve Dubois, the hotel's ever-composed concierge, adjusted the silk scarf at her neck, a splash of emerald green against her crisp black suit.  The lobby, with its plush velvet armchairs and the subtle scent of lilies, was momentarily quiet. The last of the afternoon tea guests had departed, leaving behind a faint clatter of porcelain and the lingering aroma of Earl Grey.  Genevieve glanced at the ornate grandfather clock ticking steadily in the corner. 5:17 pm.  Just another quiet, predictable Parisian evening. Or so she thought.
