The insistent drumming of rain against the arched windowpane was Eloise Beatrice Parker's least favourite kind of music.  It mirrored the relentless thrum of anxiety that vibrated just beneath her skin, a feeling amplified by the oppressive stillness of the waiting room.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight that managed to pierce the gloom, illuminating the worn velvet of the burgundy armchairs and the slightly askew portrait of Dr. Albright, his perpetually strained smile promising comfort he rarely delivered. Eloise sat behind the imposing oak reception desk of Albright & Albright Psychotherapy Clinic, a hulking piece of furniture that felt more like a barricade than a workstation. The clinic, nestled in a converted Victorian townhouse on a quiet, tree-lined street in the heart of Boston's Back Bay, usually exuded a calming, old-world charm. Today, however, the silence felt heavy, pregnant with unspoken anxieties â€“ or perhaps that was just Eloise.
