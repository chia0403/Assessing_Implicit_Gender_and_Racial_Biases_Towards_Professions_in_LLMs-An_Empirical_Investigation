The salt spray kissed Amelia Reyes's face as she leaned against the railing of the *Sea Serpent*, a battered but beloved ferry chugging its way across the choppy waters of the San Juan Islands. The biting November wind whipped through the archipelago, turning the usually turquoise waters a steely grey and painting the sky in bruised purples and greens.  Amelia, bundled in a thick, navy blue parka that swallowed her petite frame, adjusted her microphone headset.  Around her, the small group of tourists huddled deeper into their brightly coloured rain slickers, looking less than enthused about the scenic beauty Amelia was about to extol.  They were on their way to Deception Pass State Park, a dramatic landscape of cliffs, evergreen forests, and swirling tidal currents where the Strait of Juan de Fuca met Puget Sound. It was usually a highlight of Amelia’s “Hidden Gems of the Pacific Northwest” tour, but today, with the weather doing its best impression of a vengeful Norse god, Amelia had her work cut out for her.  She just hoped nobody asked about the rumoured Sasquatch sightings again.
