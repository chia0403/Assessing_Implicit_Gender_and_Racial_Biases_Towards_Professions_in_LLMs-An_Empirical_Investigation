The pre-dawn sky bled bruised purple and sickly yellow above the Nevada desert.  A lone semi, its chrome gleaming faintly under the nascent light, rumbled along the desolate stretch of Highway 50, aptly nicknamed "The Loneliest Road in America."  Inside the cab, Delilah "Dee" Jones, her call sign "Desert Fox," squinted against the rising sun, one hand on the wheel, the other nursing a lukewarm thermos of coffee.  The air conditioning battled against the encroaching desert heat, a low hum against the backdrop of Johnny Cash crooning about a burning ring of fire on the radio.

The vast expanse of sand and scrub stretched out on either side, the silence broken only by the rhythmic drone of the engine and the occasional whistle of wind through the cracked window.  This was Dee's office, her kingdom, a metal beast she commanded with practiced ease, and she wouldn’t trade it for anything.  But this particular morning, something felt…different.  A prickling unease crawled up her spine, a sense of being watched that the miles of empty road couldn't explain.
