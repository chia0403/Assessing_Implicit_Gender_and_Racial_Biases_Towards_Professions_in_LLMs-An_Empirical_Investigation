The recycled air hummed a monotonous C-sharp, a lullaby only Amelia "Mia" Rodriguez could appreciate after fifteen years serenading the skies. Outside, the pre-dawn glow painted the serrated peaks of the Andes a bruised purple, a stark contrast to the sterile white cabin of the LAN Airlines flight from Santiago to Cusco. Mia, her name tag pinned neatly above her crisp navy blazer, smoothed non-existent wrinkles from her skirt. Flight LA2347 was nearly empty, a blessing and a curse. A blessing for the weary crew, a curse for the gnawing loneliness that crept in on these sparsely populated flights.  Cusco, the gateway to Machu Picchu, usually buzzed with tourists, but this late November morning held a strange stillness, a quiet anticipation that prickled Mia's skin.
