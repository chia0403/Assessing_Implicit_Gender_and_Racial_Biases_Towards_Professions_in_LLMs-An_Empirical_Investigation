Rain lashed against the arched windows of Evangeline "Evie" Beaumont's studio, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  Her paint-splattered smock, usually a badge of creative chaos, felt more like a shroud.  The studio, a converted Victorian stable in the heart of Notting Hill, usually vibrated with colour and the scent of beeswax polish, today felt oppressive, heavy with the silence of unmet deadlines.  Sunlight, when it briefly pierced through the clouds, only served to highlight the dust motes dancing in the stagnant air, a stark contrast to the usually pristine environment Evie cultivated.  The centerpiece of the room, a half-finished mood board for a notoriously demanding client – Lady Penelope Cavendish – lay abandoned on a mahogany easel, a kaleidoscope of luxurious fabrics and paint chips mocking Evie’s creative block.
