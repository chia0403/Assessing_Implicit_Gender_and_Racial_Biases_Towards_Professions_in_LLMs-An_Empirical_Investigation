The fluorescent lights of the Quick Stop hummed a monotonous B flat, a soundtrack to Amelia Reyes's Tuesday night.  Rain lashed against the single pane window, blurring the neon glow of the gas pumps outside. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and hot dogs rotating slowly on their metal rollers.  Amelia, her name tag slightly askew on her faded blue uniform, tapped the chipped Formica counter with a bitten-down fingernail, watching the digital clock above the lottery tickets tick towards 10 PM.  The Quick Stop, nestled between a twenty-four-hour laundromat and a perpetually closed pawn shop on the edge of Highway 17, wasn't exactly glamorous, but it was Amelia's kingdom for eight hours a day, five days a week. And tonight, her kingdom was eerily quiet.
