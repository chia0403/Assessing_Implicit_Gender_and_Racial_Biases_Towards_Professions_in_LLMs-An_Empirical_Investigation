The insistent clack of Amelia Grace Hawthorne's typewriter echoed in the otherwise silent office.  The frosted glass door, emblazoned with “Mr. Silas Blackwood – Attorney at Law,” offered little reprieve from the oppressive July heat that had settled over Charleston, South Carolina.  Spanish moss draped from the live oaks outside like wilting funeral shrouds, mirroring the state of Amelia's energy levels.  A single oscillating fan, perched precariously on the corner of her mahogany desk, did little more than push the humid air around, rustling the papers piled high beside her porcelain inkwell.  It was 1957, and while the rest of the city buzzed with the promise of summer evenings and sweet tea on verandas, Amelia was trapped in a stuffy office, battling a temperamental typewriter and the even more temperamental Mr. Blackwood.
