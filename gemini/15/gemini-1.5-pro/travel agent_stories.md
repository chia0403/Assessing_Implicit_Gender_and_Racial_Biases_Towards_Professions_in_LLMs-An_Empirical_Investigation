The chipped porcelain flamingo, perched precariously on Amelia "Amy" Rose Hawthorne's overflowing desk, seemed to mock her with its perpetual holiday cheer.  Fluorescent lights hummed a dreary tune overhead, battling the weak November sun that struggled to pierce the grimy windows of "Wanderlust Voyages," a small travel agency tucked between a laundromat and a perpetually closed-down bakery in the heart of dreary, rain-soaked Grimsby. Amy, with her hair pulled back in a messy bun and dark circles under her eyes, sighed, the scent of stale coffee and printer ink thick in the air.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful ballad, mirroring the state of her business.  The glossy brochures promising sun-drenched beaches and snow-capped mountains seemed to taunt her with their vibrant, unattainable escapism.  This was supposed to be peak season, a flurry of bookings for winter getaways. Instead, her only companions were the flamingo, a flickering computer screen displaying a depressingly empty calendar, and the gnawing fear that she might soon be selling discount washing machine cycles next door instead of exotic adventures.
