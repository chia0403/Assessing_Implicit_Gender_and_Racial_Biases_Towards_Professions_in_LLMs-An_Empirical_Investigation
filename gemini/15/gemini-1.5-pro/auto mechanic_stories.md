The biting November wind whipped across the cracked asphalt of the Harmony Creek junkyard, rattling the rusted skeletons of forgotten cars.  Flakes of snow, fat and wet, began to swirl, clinging to the greasy overalls of Beatrice "Bea" Rodriguez.  Bea, her dark hair pulled back in a tight bun, squinted at the stubborn bolt on the '67 Mustang fastback, her breath clouding the air in front of her. Harmony Creek wasn't much – a blink-and-you'll-miss-it town nestled between the Appalachian foothills and the endless Ohio cornfields – but for Bea, it was home, and this junkyard, crammed with the ghosts of Detroit's glory days, was her kingdom. This particular Mustang, a beauty beneath the layers of rust and neglect, was her current obsession.  She'd promised Old Man Hemlock, the junkyard's cantankerous owner, that she'd have her running by Christmas, a feat most folks in town, including Hemlock himself, considered impossible. But Bea Rodriguez wasn't one to back down from a challenge, especially when it involved a carburetor and a good wrench.
