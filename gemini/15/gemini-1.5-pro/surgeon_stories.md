The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne as he crossed the cobbled courtyard of St. Jude's Hospital, the gothic stonework looming over him like a disapproving gargoyle.  A thin layer of frost crunched beneath his worn leather oxfords, the sound swallowed by the echoing clang of a distant ambulance siren. The air, sharp with the scent of woodsmoke and antiseptic, was a familiar cocktail that usually steeled his nerves before a difficult surgery. Tonight, however, the familiar chill felt more like a premonition.  St. Jude's, nestled in the isolated valley town of Oakhaven, Vermont, had always been a sanctuary of calm precision in Elias's life, a place where he held the power of life and death in his steady hands.  But tonight, the looming darkness felt different, heavier, as if the very stones of the hospital held their breath in anticipation of something terrible.
