The sun, a malevolent eye in the bruised purple sky, beat down on Elias Vance's orange vest.  Heat shimmered off the cracked asphalt of Route 66, blurring the already hazy Oklahoma landscape. Elias, sweat plastering his dark hair to his forehead, hefted a jackhammer, its weight familiar and comforting in his calloused hands.  Around him, the world vibrated with the low growl of heavy machinery â€“ the guttural cough of the generator, the whine of the air compressor, the rhythmic clang of his coworker, Maria, chipping away at the crumbling shoulder a few yards down.  The air, thick with the smell of diesel and hot tar, tasted of impending rain, a promise the parched earth desperately craved. They were twenty miles outside of Elk City, a speck of a town swallowed by the vast, unforgiving plains, and the only sign of life besides their small crew was the occasional hawk circling high above, patiently waiting for roadkill.  Today's job: patching a section of highway ravaged by the relentless freeze-thaw cycle of the past winter, a Sisyphean task Elias had grown accustomed to over his fifteen years with the Oklahoma Department of Transportation.
