The neon "Open" sign in the window of Dr. Elias Thorne's chiropractic clinic buzzed faintly, a counterpoint to the rhythmic swoosh of the wipers battling the relentless Seattle drizzle.  Rain slicked the streets of Ballard, reflecting the sodium-vapor glow in a shimmering tapestry across the asphalt.  Inside, the air smelled of pine-scented cleaning solution and the vaguely metallic tang of the adjusting table. Elias, a man built like a redwood – tall and solid, with hands that could crack a walnut without effort – sat at his oak desk, reviewing patient files. The clinic, nestled between a used bookstore and a pho restaurant, was quiet save for the murmur of traffic and the soft clicking of his pen against the paperwork.  It was a Tuesday evening, typically slow, and the kind of quiet that usually allowed Elias to catch up on his reading, but a persistent knot of tension tightened the muscles in his shoulders, a premonition of something unsettling just beyond the horizon.
