Rain lashed against the windows of the converted Victorian house, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Elias Thorne.  He stared out at the churning grey of Puget Sound, the Olympic Mountains barely visible through the downpour.  Elias, a registered occupational therapist with a decade of experience under his belt, usually found solace in the view from his office at the Salish Sea Rehabilitation Center.  But today, the rhythmic swoosh of the windshield wipers only amplified the relentless thrum of anxiety in his chest.  The referral on his desk, a thin manila folder with the name "Adeline Dubois" typed neatly across the tab, felt unusually heavy.  Adeline was a renowned sculptor, her hands once famed for their dexterity and strength, now rendered immobile by a devastating stroke.  Elias, a man who dedicated his life to helping others regain their independence, was suddenly plagued by a crippling doubt: could he truly help her reclaim a life inextricably interwoven with the art she could no longer create? The salty tang of the sea air, usually invigorating, now tasted of the bitter sting of potential failure.
