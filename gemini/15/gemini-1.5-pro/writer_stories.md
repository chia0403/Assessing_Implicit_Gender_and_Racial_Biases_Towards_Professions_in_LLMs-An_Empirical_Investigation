Rain lashed against the attic windows of Seabrook Cottage, a relentless drumming that mirrored the frantic rhythm of Amelia Thorne's typing.

She'd come seeking solace and inspiration amongst the wild beauty of the coast, hoping to finally finish her novel, a gothic mystery that had been languishing unfinished for far too long. But the isolation, coupled with the relentless grey skies and the ever-present roar of the ocean, was beginning to seep into her bones, blurring the lines between reality and the dark world she was creating on the page.
