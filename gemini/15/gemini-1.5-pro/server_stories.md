The flickering neon sign of the Starlight Diner cast a lurid, greasy glow over the rain-slicked asphalt of Highway 17. Inside, the air hung thick with the mingled scents of stale coffee, frying bacon, and desperation.  Rain lashed against the large plate-glass windows, blurring the already fading landscape into streaks of grey and black.  Eleanor Vance, her name tag slightly askew on her faded turquoise uniform, sighed, wiping down the sticky counter for what felt like the hundredth time that hour. The diner was practically empty, save for a lone trucker hunched over a bowl of chili in the corner booth and a couple arguing in hushed tones by the window.  Eleanor glanced at the clock â€“ 11:47 pm.  Just thirteen more minutes until her shift ended, thirteen more minutes until she could escape the oppressive silence and the persistent smell of frying onions that clung to her hair and clothes like a second skin.  Tonight, even the usual low hum of the refrigerator seemed to amplify the loneliness of the late-night shift.
