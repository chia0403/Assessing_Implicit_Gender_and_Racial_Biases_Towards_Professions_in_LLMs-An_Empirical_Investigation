The dawn in Oakhaven arrived not with a blaze of glory, but a gentle peach-colored blush creeping over the slate rooftops.  A swirl of woodsmoke, tinged with the sweet scent of cinnamon, already hung in the crisp air, a testament to Elara Thistlewood's early rising.  Her bakery, "The Sugared Plum," nestled between a dusty secondhand bookshop and a perpetually bustling florist, was the heart of this small, close-knit town.  Its windows, still fogged with condensation, glowed with a warm, inviting light, promising warmth and the comforting aroma of freshly baked goods within.  Elara, her hands dusted with flour and a stray wisp of auburn hair escaping her braid, hummed a wordless tune as she slid another tray of golden croissants into the brick oven, its hearth radiating a steady, comforting heat against the chill morning air.  Today, however, something was different.  A stillness hung over Oakhaven, a quiet expectancy that pricked at Elara's skin like the fine layer of goosebumps brought on by the autumn air.
