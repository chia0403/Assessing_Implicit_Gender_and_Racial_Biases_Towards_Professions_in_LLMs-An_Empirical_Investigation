The revolving doors of the Grand Majestic Hotel sighed open, admitting a gust of frigid November air that smelled of wet asphalt and exhaust fumes. Inside, the air shimmered with warmth and the scent of lilies, emanating from towering vases that flanked a marble staircase sweeping up to unseen opulence.  Finnian "Finn" O'Malley, his pillbox hat perched precariously on his head as he wrestled with a mountain of luggage, barely registered the change in atmosphere. His eyes, the colour of a stormy Irish sea, were fixed on the brass luggage cart’s wobbly wheel, threatening to buckle under the weight of a particularly ornate trunk plastered with travel stickers.  The lobby of the Grand Majestic, with its glittering chandeliers and hushed whispers of wealthy patrons, was Finn’s stage. He knew every creak of the polished floorboards, every echo that bounced off the vaulted ceilings, and every secret the whispering walls held within their gilded frames.  Tonight, however, the usual low hum of activity was punctuated by an electric buzz, a sense of anticipation thicker than the fog rolling in off the Hudson River. Something big was brewing at the Grand Majestic, Finn could feel it in his bones.
