The biting November wind howled around the eaves of Eventide Manor, rattling the ancient windowpanes and whistling through the gaps in the mortar. Inside, shielded from the tempest by thick stone walls,  Agnes Periwinkle hummed a jaunty tune as she polished the mahogany banister.  The grand staircase spiraled upwards, three stories of gleaming wood and wrought iron, reflecting the soft glow of the gas lamps. Eventide, perched on a windswept cliff overlooking the churning grey expanse of the North Sea, was a monument to faded Victorian grandeur.  It creaked with secrets, whispered them in the rustling of silk drapes and the sigh of settling floorboards. Agnes, however, had little time for whispers or secrets. She had floors to scrub, fireplaces to stoke, and an entire wing of dust-covered furniture to contend with. The elderly owner, Mr. Silas Blackwood, rarely ventured from his top floor study, leaving Agnes as the sole inhabitant of the sprawling manor for most of the day.  And today,  a strange disquiet hung in the air, thicker than the usual coastal fog.
