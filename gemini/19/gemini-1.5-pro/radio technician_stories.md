The flickering neon sign of the "Starlite Diner" cast a greasy, electric glow across the rain-slicked asphalt of Highway 17.  Inside, a lone waitress wiped down the chrome counter, the only sound competing with the rhythmic drumming of the downpour being the mournful crooning of Hank Williams drifting from the dusty jukebox in the corner.  October had chilled the small town of Harmony Creek, Virginia down to the bone, and even the usually boisterous Friday night crowd seemed deterred by the weather.  This suited Elias Vance, however.  He preferred the quiet.  Elias, with his perpetually grease-stained fingertips and a nametag that read "WCHV - Chief Technician," sat hunched over a tangle of wires and vacuum tubes in the cramped radio station booth attached to the back of the diner.  The air smelled of stale coffee, ozone, and the faint metallic tang of soldering iron.  WCHV, Harmony Creek's only radio station, was experiencing its nightly bout of technical difficulties, and Elias, as always, was the only one who could coax the aging equipment back to life.
