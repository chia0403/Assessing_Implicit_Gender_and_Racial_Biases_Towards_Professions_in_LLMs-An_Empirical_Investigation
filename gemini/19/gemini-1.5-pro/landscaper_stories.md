The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorne, tugging at the brim of his worn-out baseball cap and rustling the browned leaves of the ancient oak that dominated Mrs. Hemlock's yard.  A dusting of early snow clung precariously to the branches, threatening to cascade down at any moment.  Elias, his breath puffing out in white clouds, surveyed the scene with a practiced eye.  The once-vibrant summer blooms had faded, leaving behind skeletal remains, and the meticulously manicured lawn had succumbed to the encroaching chill.  He shifted his weight from one worn work boot to the other, the frozen ground crunching beneath him. Hemlock House, a sprawling Victorian mansion perched on a hill overlooking the sleepy town of Oakhaven, looked imposing even in its state of autumnal decay.  It was Elias's most prestigious client, and the most demanding. He pulled his thick gloves tighter, the leather creaking in protest. Winter was coming, and there was much to be done.
