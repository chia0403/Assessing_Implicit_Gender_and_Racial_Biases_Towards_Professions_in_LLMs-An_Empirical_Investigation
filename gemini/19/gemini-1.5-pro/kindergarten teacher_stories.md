The damp chill of a Seattle November clung to Miss Clementine Ainsworth like a second skin as she unlocked the brightly painted door of Room Three at Maple Leaf Kindergarten.  Rain lashed against the large windows, blurring the vibrant playground beyond into a swirling kaleidoscope of green and grey. Inside, the fluorescent lights hummed a quiet welcome, illuminating the miniature world of tiny tables and chairs, colourful alphabet friezes, and a story corner overflowing with well-loved picture books.  A faint scent of finger paint and playdough hung in the air, a comforting aroma that Clementine had come to associate with the imminent arrival of tiny humans and the controlled chaos that inevitably followed.  This morning, however, a strange stillness permeated the room, a quiet anticipation that feltâ€¦different.
