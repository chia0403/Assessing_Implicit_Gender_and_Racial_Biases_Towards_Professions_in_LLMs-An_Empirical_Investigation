The biting pre-dawn air, sharp with the scent of pine and frost, nipped at Jedediah "Jed" Blackwood's exposed cheeks as he trudged through the knee-deep snow. His breath puffed out in ghostly plumes, quickly dissipating against the backdrop of the looming Cascade Mountains.  Towering pines, cloaked in white, clawed at the bruised, indigo sky, their branches groaning under the weight. This was the Clearwater National Forest in northern Idaho, a land of ancient giants and unforgiving winters, and Jed knew it intimately.  His thick, calloused hands, raw even through his gloves, gripped the worn leather handle of his thermos, seeking a fleeting warmth against the creeping cold.  The first rays of sun, still hidden behind the jagged peaks, painted the eastern sky in hues of rose and gold, promising a brief respite from the relentless chill.  Today, like every day, Jed was heading towards the heart of the old-growth forest, a place known only to him and a handful of other loggers, where the truly majestic trees stood, silent sentinels of a bygone era.
