The stale scent of frying oil clung to Amelia "Amy" Reyes like a second skin.  It permeated the worn red vinyl booths, the checkered linoleum floor, and even the chipped porcelain mugs hanging above the counter. The Cozy Corner Cafe, nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed antique shop on Elm Street, wasn't glamorous.  It was, however, Amy's domain.  At 6:00 am, the weak November sun barely peeked over the brick buildings of Havenwood, Illinois, casting long shadows that stretched across the empty tables.  Amy, already on her second cup of coffee, wiped down the counter, the rhythmic squeak of the rag a familiar morning song. Today, like every other day, she was ready to face Havenwood's breakfast rush, armed with a pot of hot coffee, a stack of menus, and a smile that could melt even the grumpiest of morning moods.  Little did she know, this particular Tuesday was about to be anything but ordinary.
