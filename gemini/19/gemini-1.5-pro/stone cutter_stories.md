The biting wind whipped across the desolate moors of North Yorkshire, carrying with it the scent of heather and the distant, mournful cry of a curlew.  Grey clouds, heavy with the promise of rain, clung low to the craggy peaks of the hills.  Nestled in the shadow of Whernside, the highest of the Three Peaks, lay the small village of Kettlewell, a cluster of stone houses huddled together as if for warmth.  It was here, in a workshop carved directly into the side of the fell, that Elias Thorne, a man as weathered and unyielding as the Yorkshire stone he worked, plied his ancient craft.  The rhythmic clang of his hammer against chisel echoed through the valley, a lonely counterpoint to the windâ€™s lament.  Inside, the air hung thick with the dust of ages, illuminated by the flickering light of a single oil lamp that cast dancing shadows across the rough-hewn walls.  Elias, his face etched with the lines of a life spent wrestling beauty from the unforgiving rock, squinted at the half-formed figure emerging from the block of millstone grit before him.  It was a commission for the local church, a depiction of St. Cuthbert, and Elias poured every ounce of his skill and devotion into the work.
