Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's chiropractic clinic, mimicking the rhythmic throb of pain in his own lower back. The "Thorne Chiropractic & Wellness Center" sign, usually a beacon of vibrant health against the backdrop of the sleepy Oregon town of Port Blossom, was barely visible through the downpour. Inside, the waiting room, usually bustling with patients seeking relief from their aches and pains, was eerily quiet. Only the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock and the hiss of the radiator punctuated the silence.  Elias, his sandy hair plastered to his forehead, stared out at the deluge, a gnawing unease settling in his stomach. This wasn't just another rainy Tuesday in Port Blossom; something felt different, something feltâ€¦wrong.
