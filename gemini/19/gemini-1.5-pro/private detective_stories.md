Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Elias Thorne's office, each drop a staccato note in the symphony of the city.  Neon signs flickered erratically across the slick streets of downtown Los Angeles, reflecting in the puddles that pooled like miniature oil slicks on the cracked pavement below.

It was November 1947, and the chill that permeated the air seeped into the very bones of the city, a chill that had nothing to do with the weather.
