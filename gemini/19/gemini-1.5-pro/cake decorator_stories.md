The scent of burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the usually saccharine atmosphere of Buttercup Bakery. Amelia "Amy" Rose Hawthorne, her strawberry-blonde braid coming undone, stared with dismay at the tiered monstrosity before her.  It was supposed to be a masterpiece, a whimsical carousel cake for little Lily Thompson's fifth birthday, complete with fondant horses and spun-sugar balloons. Instead, one of the horses had slumped sideways, its sugary mane melting into a sticky puddle, and the entire top tier leaned precariously, threatening to send the whole thing crashing down. Outside, the setting sun cast long shadows across the quaint, cobbled street of Harmony Glade, a town known for its picturesque charm and fiercely competitive baking scene.  Amy, usually the picture of composure and creativity, felt a prickle of panic. Lily's party was in just three hours, and her reputation as Harmony Glade's premier cake artist hung in the balance.
