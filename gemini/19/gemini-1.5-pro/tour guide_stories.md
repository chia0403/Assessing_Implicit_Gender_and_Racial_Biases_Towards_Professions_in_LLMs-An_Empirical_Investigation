The midday sun beat down on the terracotta rooftops of Siena, baking the ancient bricks to a shimmering heat haze.  Dust motes danced in the golden light filtering through the Piazza del Campo, illuminating the worn flagstones where Amelia Rossi, her name tag pinned neatly to her crisp linen shirt, adjusted her microphone.  Amelia, a woman whose energy seemed to effortlessly defy the Tuscan heat, beamed at the small group gathered before her.  Eleven pairs of expectant eyes, shaded by a variety of hats and sunglasses, blinked back at her. They were a motley crew: a retired couple from Ohio, a gaggle of boisterous Australian students, a lone Japanese photographer meticulously documenting everything, and a family of four from France who seemed perpetually on the verge of losing one of their two rambunctious children.  This was Amelia’s third tour of the day, and while the script remained the same, the dynamics of each group always offered a unique performance.  Today’s promised to be particularly… interesting. The Palio, Siena's infamous bareback horse race, was only a week away, and the city thrummed with an electric anticipation that bordered on frenzy.  The banners of the seventeen Contrade, the city's historic districts, hung proudly from every window and doorway, transforming the medieval streets into a vibrant tapestry of rivalry and tradition.  It was into this cauldron of excitement that Amelia was about to lead her unsuspecting tourists.
