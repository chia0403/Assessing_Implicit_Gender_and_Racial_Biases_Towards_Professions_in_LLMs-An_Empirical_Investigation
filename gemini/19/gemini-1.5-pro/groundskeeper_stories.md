It was a beauty Elias cherished, a solitude he rarely shared with the manor's inhabitants, the reclusive Van Derlyn family, who preferred the confines of their shadowed halls to the crisp air and vibrant decay of the autumn landscape.  This morning, however, something felt different.  A disquiet hung in the air, heavier than the mist, colder than the frost.  It settled in the pit of Eliasâ€™s stomach, a premonition of something unsettling about to bloom amidst the browning rose bushes.
