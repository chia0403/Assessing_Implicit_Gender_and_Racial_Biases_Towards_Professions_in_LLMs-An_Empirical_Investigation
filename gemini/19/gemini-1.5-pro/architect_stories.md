The wind whipped off the Puget Sound, carrying the scent of salt and pine through the open windows of Eleanor Vance's studio apartment. Rain lashed against the oversized panes, blurring the Seattle skyline into a watercolour wash of greys and blues.  Eleanor, bundled in a thick cable-knit cardigan despite the late July date, hunched over her drafting table. Scattered around her were blueprints for the latest project consuming her â€“ the ambitious renovation of the historic Rainier Tower, a once-grand art deco skyscraper now faded and neglected.

The glow of the Anglepoise lamp illuminated the fine lines etched onto her face, reflecting the weight of both the challenge and the opportunity this project represented. This wasn't just any renovation; it was Eleanor's chance to make her mark on the city she loved, to breathe life back into a forgotten landmark. But beneath the determined set of her jaw and the focused glint in her eye, a flicker of anxiety danced.  The Rainier Tower held secrets, whispers of a past tragedy that had left its mark not only on the building but also on the city's collective memory. And as Eleanor delved deeper into the blueprints, she began to suspect those secrets might not want to be unearthed.
