The biting Antarctic wind whipped at Dr. Evelyn Reed’s parka, stinging any exposed skin and rattling the ice-encrusted windows of the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station.  Inside, the geothermal heat hummed a constant, low thrum, a stark contrast to the howling wilderness beyond.

And tonight, she was convinced, the ice was trying to tell her something extraordinary.
