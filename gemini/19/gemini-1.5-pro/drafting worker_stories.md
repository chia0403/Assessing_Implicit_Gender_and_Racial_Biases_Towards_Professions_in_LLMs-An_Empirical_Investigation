The flickering fluorescent lights of the D&M Architectural firm buzzed in Amelia Grace Holloway's ears, a constant, irritating hum that mirrored the low thrum of anxiety in her chest. It was a Friday afternoon in late October, the kind where the sky outside the large, grime-streaked windows had already surrendered to dusk, casting long shadows across the rows of drafting tables. Amelia, her fingers stained with graphite and ink, meticulously adjusted the angle of a French curve against the vellum, her brow furrowed in concentration.  The air in the cavernous room, thick with the scent of tracing paper, stale coffee, and the faint metallic tang of drafting tools, felt heavy and stagnant.  Rain hammered against the glass, mirroring the insistent tapping of her mechanical pencil as she finalized the details of a particularly intricate section of the blueprints for the new city library – a project she’d poured her heart and soul into for the past six months.  Despite the oppressive atmosphere and the gnawing fear that Mr. Henderson, the notoriously demanding senior architect, would find some minute flaw in her work, a quiet sense of satisfaction settled within Amelia. She loved the precision, the logic, the tangible creation that emerged from the chaos of lines and angles.  This, she knew, was where she belonged.
