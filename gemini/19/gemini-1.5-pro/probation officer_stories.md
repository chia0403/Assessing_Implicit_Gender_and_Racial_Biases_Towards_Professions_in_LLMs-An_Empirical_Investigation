The stale, recirculated air of the probation office hummed a monotonous C sharp.  Fluorescent lights, buzzing with the threat of imminent failure, cast a sickly yellow pall over everything, highlighting the worn linoleum floor and chipped Formica desks.  A framed motivational poster featuring a soaring eagle and the slogan "Reach for the Skies!" hung askew above the overflowing filing cabinets, a monument to ironic optimism.  Eleanor Vance, her dark brown hair pulled back in a severe bun that did little to soften the sharp angles of her face, tapped a chipped mug against the rim of her overflowing ashtray. The dregs of lukewarm coffee swirled, mirroring the turbulent emotions churning within her. Outside, the relentless Detroit rain lashed against the grimy windows, mirroring the bleakness that had settled over her fifteen-year career. This Monday morning, like so many before it, promised another parade of broken promises and shattered dreams.  Today, however, Eleanor had a feeling things were about to get a whole lot worse.
