Rain lashed against the arched windows of Eleanor Vance's attic apartment, each drop a tiny explosion against the glass.  The wind howled a mournful song down the narrow chimney, a counterpoint to the rhythmic tapping of Eleanor's fingers on the worn keys of her ancient typewriter.  Her apartment, nestled under the eaves of a centuries-old building on Rue des Écrivains in the Latin Quarter of Paris, usually felt romantic and inspiring. Tonight, however, with the storm raging and deadlines looming, it felt more like a forgotten garret, a place where creativity went to die a slow, ink-stained death. Eleanor, a freelance editor specializing in obscure historical texts, was hunched over a particularly challenging manuscript – a 17th-century alchemist's journal filled with cryptic symbols and indecipherable handwriting.  A half-empty mug of lukewarm tea sat beside the typewriter, a testament to the hours she'd already poured into deciphering the rambling prose.  The only other light in the room came from a flickering gas lamp that cast long, dancing shadows across the stacks of books and papers that threatened to engulf her small living space.
