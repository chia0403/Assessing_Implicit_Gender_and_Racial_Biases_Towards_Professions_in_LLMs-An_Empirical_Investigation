The relentless Arizona sun beat down on the cracked asphalt of the parking lot, baking the interior of Beatrice "Bea" Goldblum's Ford Focus to a temperature rivaling the surface of Mercury.  Bea, a seasoned insurance agent for Desert Palm Casualty, adjusted her crisp white linen blazer and sighed. The shimmer of heat rising from the asphalt distorted the view of the dusty, single-story buildings lining Main Street in the desolate town of Redemption, Arizona.  Population: 487 (and dwindling). This was Beaâ€™s territory, a sprawling expanse of sun-scorched desert, tumbleweeds, and the occasional bewildered tourist who'd taken a wrong turn off Route 66. Today's appointment was with a Mr. Jedediah Peabody, owner of the Redemption Reptile Ranch, and Bea already felt a creeping sense of foreboding slithering down her spine.  Peabody's claim involved a runaway albino python, a missing prize-winning tortoise, and a vague mention of "divine intervention." Bea gripped her briefcase tighter, a flicker of apprehension in her usually bright blue eyes. This was definitely not going to be a standard house call.
