The flickering fluorescent lights of the Kressler & Blake Law Offices buzzed like trapped insects, a counterpoint to the rhythmic drumming of Amelia Grace Holloway’s fingers on her keyboard.  Rain lashed against the panoramic windows overlooking downtown Chicago, the city lights blurring into a hazy, impressionistic painting of gold and crimson. It was 7:17 pm on a Friday, and Amelia was the only person left in the office, save for Mr. Henderson, the night security guard, who whistled cheerfully from his post in the lobby.  The scent of stale coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air, a familiar aroma in the weeks leading up to a major trial.  This one, the Peterson vs. OmniCorp case, was particularly brutal, a David-and-Goliath battle that had Amelia working sixteen-hour days, fuelled by lukewarm takeout and the faint hope that justice, for once, might actually prevail.  Tonight, she was hunting for a single, elusive document – a signed affidavit that could either make or break their case.  And it was buried somewhere in the mountain of paperwork that currently threatened to engulf her small, cluttered office.
