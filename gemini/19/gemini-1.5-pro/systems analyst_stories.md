The flickering fluorescent lights of the server room cast a sickly green pall over Elias Thorne, his reflection a ghostly shimmer in the polished steel of the rack cabinets.  Outside, the Chicago wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the single, grime-streaked window high in the concrete wall.  It was 2:17 AM, a time Elias had become intimately familiar with during the past week.  He ran a hand through his already disheveled dark hair, the faint scent of burnt coffee clinging to his fingertips.  For seven days and nights, he'd been hunched over his laptop, a tangle of network cables snaking around his feet, desperately trying to isolate the source of the intermittent system crashes plaguing Zenith Financial.  Each crash cost the company thousands, and Elias, their lead systems analyst, felt the weight of every lost dollar pressing down on him like the stale, recycled air of the server room. The low hum of the machines, usually a comforting background noise, now grated on his nerves, a constant reminder of the digital beast he was wrestling.  And tonight, the beast was winning.
