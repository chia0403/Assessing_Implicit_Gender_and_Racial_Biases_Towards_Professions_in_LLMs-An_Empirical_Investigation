The biting wind whipped across the desolate stretch of Interstate 90, carrying the scent of sagebrush and diesel.  A sliver of pre-dawn light, pale and watery, began to paint the eastern sky above the Montana plains.  Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez, bundled in a fluorescent orange parka and thick, steel-toed boots, stamped her feet against the frigid asphalt. Her breath plumed out in white puffs, quickly dispersed by the unrelenting wind. Around her, the vast emptiness of the prairie stretched out, broken only by the dark, undulating silhouettes of distant hills and the steady hum of her crew's idling truck.  They were parked precariously close to the shoulder, their flashing hazard lights blinking a rhythmic warning to the sparse pre-rush hour traffic. This stretch of I-90, between Billings and Miles City, was notorious for its harsh weather and even harsher drivers, and today, a section of the road had buckled under the strain of the recent freeze-thaw cycle, creating a pothole the size of a small bathtub. Amy, lead highway maintenance technician for this district, knew they had to fix it, and fast.
