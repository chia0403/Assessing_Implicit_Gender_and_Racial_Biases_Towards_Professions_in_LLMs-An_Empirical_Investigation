The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, carrying the scent of frozen algae and exhaust fumes.  Flakes of snow, fat and wet, plastered themselves to the windshield of Ambulance 61, blurring the already fading light of the Chicago afternoon. Inside, Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez, a paramedic with Chicago Fire Department Ambulance 61, rubbed her gloved hands together, trying to coax some life back into her numb fingers. The heater in the rig was fighting a losing battle against the encroaching cold.  Her partner, a seasoned EMT named Frank "Mac" McAlister, hummed tunelessly under his breath, tapping out a rhythm on the steering wheel as he navigated the potholed streets of Englewood.  The radio crackled to life, dispatch's bored voice cutting through the relative calm. "Ambulance 61, respond priority one, 67th and Halsted. Possible GSW. Police are on scene, requesting immediate EMS assist." The casual tone belied the urgency of the call.  Amy's stomach clenched. Another shooting.  It was barely 4pm, and already the city was bleeding.
