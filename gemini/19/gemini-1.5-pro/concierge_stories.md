The opulent lobby of the Grand Majestic Hotel hummed with a low, constant thrum, a symphony of hushed conversations, the click of Louis Vuitton heels on marble, and the tinkling of crystal chandeliers.  Rain lashed against the arched windows, blurring the already fading twilight into a watercolour wash of grey.  Inside, a fire crackled merrily in the hearth, casting dancing shadows that chased across the Persian rugs.  Eleanor Ainsworth, the hotel's esteemed Head Concierge, stood behind her polished mahogany desk, a picture of serene competence. Her crisp white blouse and navy skirt were impeccably tailored, a single silver dragonfly brooch pinned near her collarbone the only adornment.  A phone call, its melody an incongruously jaunty rendition of "Putting on the Ritz", shattered the elegant calm. Eleanor picked it up, her smile practiced and perfect. "Grand Majestic, this is Eleanor Ainsworth. How may I assist you?"  Little did she know, this call was about to unravel the exquisitely crafted world she maintained with such effortless grace.
