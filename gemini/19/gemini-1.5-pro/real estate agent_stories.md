The crisp October air, scented with woodsmoke and decaying leaves, nipped at Amelia Hayes's cheeks as she wrestled a "For Sale" sign into the frozen ground.  Frost crunched under her sensible heels, the sound strangely loud in the pre-dawn quiet.  Around her, the small town of Oakhaven, nestled in the heart of the Vermont Green Mountains, slumbered.  The only other signs of life were the twinkling fairy lights strung across the porch of the general store across the street, and the faint glow emanating from the bakery next door, promising warm cinnamon rolls in a few short hours. Amelia pulled her crimson scarf tighter around her neck, the vibrant colour a stark contrast to the muted tones of the early morning light and the weathered grey clapboard of the house behind her.  This listing, a dilapidated Victorian with peeling paint and an overgrown garden, was her last chance to prove to herself, and to her perpetually skeptical father, that she could make it as a real estate agent in a town where everyone seemed content to stay put for generations.
