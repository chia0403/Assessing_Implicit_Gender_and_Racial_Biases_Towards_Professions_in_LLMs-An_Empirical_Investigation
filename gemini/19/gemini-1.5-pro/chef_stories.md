The clatter of a dropped saucepan echoed through the otherwise silent kitchen of "Le Papillon Bleu," a small, but ambitious bistro tucked away on a cobbled side street in the Marais district of Paris.  Rain lashed against the arched windows, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Chef Antoine Dubois.  It was 3:00 am, hours before the first delivery of fresh produce would arrive, and Antoine, his apron smeared with flour and frustration, stared into the glazed depths of a failed chocolate soufflé.  He ran a hand through his already disheveled dark hair.  This soufflé, intended to be the centerpiece of his new autumn menu, was stubbornly refusing to cooperate, its center collapsing in on itself like a dying star.  Outside, the Parisian dawn was just beginning to paint the sky a bruised purple, but inside Le Papillon Bleu, darkness still reigned.
