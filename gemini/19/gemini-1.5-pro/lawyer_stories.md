The rain hammered against the leaded glass windows of Alistair Finchâ€™s office, each drop a tiny, frantic drumbeat against the quiet hum of the antique grandfather clock in the corner.  Alistair, whose full name was Alistair Humphrey Finch III, but who preferred the streamlined version, even in legal documents, stared out at the deluge washing over Charleston, South Carolina. The historic city, usually vibrant with horse-drawn carriages and the murmur of tourists, was subdued, the cobblestone streets gleaming under a slick, grey sheen.  Spanish moss, heavy with water, draped from the live oaks like mournful widows, and the scent of wet jasmine hung heavy in the air.  It was the kind of day that bred secrets, the kind of day that made confessions easy and truths harder to bear. It was also, unfortunately, the kind of day that brought Eleanor Vance, dripping and distraught, into Alistair's office.
