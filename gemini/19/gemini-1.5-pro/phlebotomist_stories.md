The fluorescent lights of St. Jude's Hospital hummed a monotonous B-flat, a soundtrack Amelia Reyes had grown accustomed to over her five years as a phlebotomist. The pre-dawn chill still clung to the air in the outpatient lab, despite the wall-mounted heater wheezing valiantly in the corner.  Amelia, bundled in a lilac cardigan over her crisp white uniform, adjusted the tourniquet on a drowsy-eyed elderly gentleman. Outside, the Chicago skyline was just beginning to blush pink and orange, the first hints of sunrise painting the skyscrapers in soft hues.  The clatter of a dropped tray in the nearby hematology lab momentarily broke the quiet hum, followed by a muffled curse. Amelia stifled a yawn, the scent of antiseptic and stale coffee thick in the air.  This was her normal. This was her Tuesday.  But something about the stillness, the almost expectant hush in the air, told her this Tuesday might be different.
