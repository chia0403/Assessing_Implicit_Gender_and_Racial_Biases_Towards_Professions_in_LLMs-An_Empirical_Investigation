The rain, a relentless Seattle drizzle, slicked the cobblestone streets outside Dr. Eleanor Vance's office.  Her name, etched in elegant script on the frosted glass of the door, was barely visible through the downpour. Inside, the warm glow of a Tiffany lamp cast long shadows across the Persian rug, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air.  Eleanor, with her auburn hair pulled back in a loose bun, tapped a pen against her notepad, the rhythmic clicking a counterpoint to the muted traffic sounds filtering through the thick drapes.  Her office, nestled on the second floor of a century-old building overlooking Puget Sound, was a sanctuary, a space designed for quiet reflection and whispered confessions.  It was 5:53 pm on a Tuesday, and her last client of the day, a chronically anxious accountant, had just departed, leaving behind a faint scent of sandalwood cologne and the lingering weight of unspoken anxieties.  Eleanor sighed, the tension slowly ebbing from her shoulders.  This was the quiet moment, the brief respite before she stepped back into the bustling, rain-soaked city.  But tonight, the quiet held a different weight, a premonition of something unsettling stirring just beneath the surface.
