The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne as he hurried across the cobbled courtyard of St. Jude's Hospital, the gothic arches looming above him like skeletal fingers against the bruised twilight sky.  Rain, sharp as needles, began to fall, plastering his dark hair to his forehead.  He tugged his worn leather satchel closer, its contents – a first edition of Gray's Anatomy and a thermos of lukewarm coffee – a meager comfort against the chill that seeped deep into his bones.  St. Jude's, perched precariously on the windswept cliffs overlooking the churning North Sea, was a place of both solace and shadows, a sanctuary for the sick and a crucible for the souls of those who tended to them. Tonight, Elias felt the shadows more acutely than the solace.  The flickering gas lamps in the hospital windows cast an eerie, theatrical glow on the swirling mist, and the rhythmic crash of the waves against the rocks below sounded like a restless heartbeat in the gathering gloom.  He knew, with a certainty that settled heavy in his stomach, that tonight would be a long one.
