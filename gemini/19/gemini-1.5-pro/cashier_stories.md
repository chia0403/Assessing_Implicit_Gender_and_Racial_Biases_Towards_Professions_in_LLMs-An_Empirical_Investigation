The fluorescent lights of the Quick Stop hummed a monotonous B flat, a soundtrack to Amelia Reyes's Tuesday afternoon.  Outside, the New Mexico sun beat down on the cracked asphalt of the parking lot, baking the air thick and hazy. Dust devils danced across the empty spaces, occasionally swirling up against the grimy glass doors. Inside, the air conditioning battled valiantly, but the small convenience store still held the oppressive heat of a slow-cooked stew. Amelia, perched behind the worn counter, idly tapped her chipped, cherry-red nails against the scuffed linoleum. A single, half-eaten bag of BBQ chips and a lukewarm can of generic cola kept her company, the remnants of a lunch break taken between the sporadic rushes of customers.  The bell above the door chimed, announcing the arrival of precisely no one, the sensor triggered by a rogue tumbleweed skipping past.  Amelia sighed, the sound lost in the whir of the coolers and the hypnotic hum of the lights.  This was Tucumcari, after all, and excitement was a rare commodity.
