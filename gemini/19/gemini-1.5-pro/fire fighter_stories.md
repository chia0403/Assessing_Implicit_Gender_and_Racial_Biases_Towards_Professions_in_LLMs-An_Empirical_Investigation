The biting wind whipped off Lake Superior, turning the falling snow into horizontal needles that stung Cassandra "Cassie" Reyes's exposed cheeks. It was a brutal January night in Duluth, Minnesota, the kind that froze exposed skin in seconds and made even the hardiest Minnesotans think twice about venturing outside.  Cassie, bundled in her heavy turnout gear, adjusted her helmet and stamped her feet against the icy pavement. Red and blue lights pulsed across the slick surface, reflecting off the storefronts of Canal Park, usually bustling with tourists but now deserted. The air crackled with anticipation and the acrid smell of smoke, a familiar cocktail to Cassie. Tonight, the blaze wasn't consuming a tourist trap or a historic lakeside mansion, but something far more vital to the heart of Duluth: the iconic DeWitt-Seitz Marketplace, a century-old building housing local artisan shops and the beloved Vikre Distillery.
