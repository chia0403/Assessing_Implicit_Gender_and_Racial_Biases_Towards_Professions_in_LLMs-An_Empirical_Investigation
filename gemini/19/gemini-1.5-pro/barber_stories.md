The rusty squeak of the barber chair was as familiar to Elias Finch as his own heartbeat.  Elias, a man whose neatly trimmed salt-and-pepper beard mirrored the precise lines he carved into his customers' hair, ran Finch's Fine Cuts, the only barbershop in the drowsy, dust-choked town of Harmony Creek, Arizona. Harmony Creek wasn’t much to look at, a sunbaked sprawl of low-slung buildings clinging to the edge of a forgotten highway.  The air vibrated with the low hum of cicadas and the distant rumble of freight trains, their mournful whistles echoing across the mesquite-dotted plains. Inside the barbershop, the air was thick with the scent of bay rum and talcum powder, a comforting aroma that had permeated the walls for over fifty years, ever since Elias's grandfather first opened the shop's doors.  The faded photographs lining the walls – sepia-toned portraits of stern-faced cowboys and flapper girls with bobbed hair – served as silent witnesses to the town's slow, steady decline.  This Wednesday morning, however, felt different.  A strange, electric tension crackled in the air, unsettling the usual sleepy stillness of Harmony Creek.
