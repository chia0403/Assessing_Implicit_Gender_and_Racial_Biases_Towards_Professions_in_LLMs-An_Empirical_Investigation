The chipped paint on the windowsill of Mrs. Eleanor Ainsworth's third-grade classroom at Maplewood Elementary was the exact shade of the dried mud clinging to eight-year-old Billy Becker's sneakers.  October in Vermont had a way of painting everything in muted browns and oranges, a palette reflected in the piles of fallen leaves swirling outside the windowpane. Rain drummed a steady rhythm against the glass, punctuated by the occasional shriek of wind that rattled the ancient, single-paned windows. Inside, the air buzzed with the quiet hum of twenty-two children diligently – or at least ostensibly – working on their leaf-rubbing art projects.  Mrs. Ainsworth, a woman whose gentle smile belied a surprising reserve, surveyed the room, her gaze lingering a moment longer on Billy, whose leaf rubbing bore a suspicious resemblance to a very large, very hairy spider.  She had a feeling this would be an interesting afternoon.
