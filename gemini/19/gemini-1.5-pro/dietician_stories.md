The biting November wind whipped around Eleanor Vance, sending stray leaves swirling like miniature dervishes across the cobbled marketplace. Her breath puffed out in white clouds as she clutched her satchel tighter, the crisp brown paper bag within rustling with the promise of fresh, locally sourced produce. Eleanor, a registered dietician with a passion bordering on obsession for seasonal eating, was on a mission.  The weekly farmers market in the shadow of St. Michael's Church, in the quaint, coastal town of Port Blossom, Maine, was her hunting ground, her laboratory, her source of inspiration. Grey skies threatened snow, the fishing boats bobbed restlessly in the harbor, and the air smelled of brine and woodsmoke.  Today, Eleanor was determined to find the perfect butternut squash, the cornerstone of a new autumnal soup recipe she was developing.  She just had to outmaneuver Mrs. Peabody, the notoriously competitive baker known for snatching up the best produce before anyone else even had a chance to admire it.
