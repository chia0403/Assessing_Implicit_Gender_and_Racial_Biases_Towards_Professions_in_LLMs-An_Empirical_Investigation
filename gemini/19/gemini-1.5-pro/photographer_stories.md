The biting wind whipped Amelia Reyes's dark hair across her face as she adjusted the tripod on the precipice of the Devil's Tooth.  Jagged, snow-dusted peaks clawed at the iron-grey sky, and the valley below, the desolate beauty of the Montana wilderness, stretched out like a crumpled, monochrome tapestry.  Amelia, bundled in layers of fleece and down, ignored the numb sting in her fingers as she fiddled with the settings on her Nikon D850.  This wasn't a shoot for National Geographic; this was personal. This was about capturing the raw, untamed spirit of a landscape that mirrored the turmoil in her own soul.  Five years, two continents, and countless photographs later, she was finally back where it all began, hoping to find something – or maybe lose something – in the vast emptiness of Big Sky Country.
