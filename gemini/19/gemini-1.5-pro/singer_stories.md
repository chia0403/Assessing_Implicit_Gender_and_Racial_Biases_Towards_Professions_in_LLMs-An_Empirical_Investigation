The flickering gaslights of Montmartre painted Aurelia Moreau’s face in a chiaroscuro of amber and shadow.  The air hung thick with the scent of absinthe and cheap perfume, mingling with the melancholic strains of a lone accordion wheezing from a nearby alley.  It was a November night in 1898, and a biting wind whipped down from Sacré-Cœur, rustling the dead leaves clinging to the skeletal branches lining the cobbled streets.  Aurelia, wrapped in a threadbare shawl that did little to ward off the chill, adjusted the worn guitar case slung across her back. The Café des Rêves, its windows fogged with the warmth inside, beckoned like a haven.  Tonight, her voice, a smoky contralto that could fill the grandest opera house or the humblest tavern, would be her only currency.  Tonight, she hoped, it would be enough.
