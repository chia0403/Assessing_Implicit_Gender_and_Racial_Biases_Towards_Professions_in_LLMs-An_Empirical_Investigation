The bell above the door of "Petal & Plume" jingled merrily, a counterpoint to the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of Eliza Jane Wilder's shears.  Outside, the Charleston, South Carolina air hung thick and heavy with the scent of jasmine and impending rain.  Inside, the small shop, crammed with buckets overflowing with hydrangeas, roses, and lilies, pulsed with a cooler, earthy fragrance.  Eliza Jane, her brow furrowed in concentration, coaxed a rebellious sprig of ivy into submission, weaving it around a base of fragrant stargazer lilies.  Sunlight, fractured by the prism hanging in the window, splashed rainbows across her dusty apron and the worn wooden floorboards.  This Wednesday morning was proving unusually busy, even for wedding season, and Eliza Jane, despite the pleasant ache in her fingers, felt a familiar hum of contentment.  She thrived in the chaos of creation, surrounded by the vibrant hues and delicate textures of her beloved blooms.
