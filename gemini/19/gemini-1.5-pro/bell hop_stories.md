The revolving doors of the Grand Majestic Hotel whispered a constant sigh of warm, perfumed air onto the bustling London street.  Rain, a persistent drizzle common to November in the city, slicked the pavement, reflecting the gaslight glow in a shimmering mosaic. Inside, beneath a gargantuan chandelier dripping with crystal teardrops, Alistair Finch, a bell hop of barely nineteen years, straightened his emerald green uniform.  The lobby thrummed with the low murmur of conversations, the clinking of teacups in the Palm Court, and the distant strains of a piano concerto. Alistair, with his shock of unruly auburn hair perpetually escaping his cap and a scattering of freckles across his nose, felt a familiar thrill.  Another night at the Grand Majestic, and another chance to witness the kaleidoscope of lives passing through its grand doors.  Tonight, however, felt different. The air was thick with an unspoken anticipation, a sense of something about to unfold.
