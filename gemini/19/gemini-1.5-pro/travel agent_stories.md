The flickering neon sign of "Wanderlust Voyages" cast an anemic glow across Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's tired face. Rain lashed against the windowpane, mirroring the storm brewing inside her.  It was 9:17 pm on a Tuesday in November, and the only other occupant of the small, cluttered travel agency was a half-dead ficus tree in the corner. Amy, normally energized by the vibrant brochures and posters depicting sun-drenched beaches and snow-capped mountains, felt the weight of another slow day pressing down on her.  Located in the quaint, but decidedly sleepy, seaside town of Port Blossom, Maine, Wanderlust Voyages wasn't exactly bustling, especially not in the off-season.  The scent of stale coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air, punctuated by the rhythmic tick-tock of a vintage clock on the wall â€“ a clock that seemed to be mocking the slow passage of time.  Amy sighed, rubbing her temples, the dream of owning her own agency starting to feel more like a beautiful postcard than a reality.
