The rusted Ford Econoline, affectionately dubbed "The Pipe Dream," coughed and sputtered as Beatrice "Bea" Rodriguez wrestled it to a stop in front of the dilapidated Victorian.  Rain, a constant companion in the Oregon coastal town of Port Blossom, hammered against the van's chipped windshield, blurring the already fading "Rodriguez Plumbing - We Fix Your Leaks!" lettering painted on the driver's side.  Ivy, thick as a python, snaked its way up the peeling paint of the house, threatening to swallow the entire structure whole.  One crooked, stained-glass window, depicting a forlorn-looking mermaid, stared out at Bea like a watery, disapproving eye.  This was the Hemlock House, notorious in Port Blossom not only for its perpetually leaky pipes but for the whispers of strange happenings within its decaying walls.  Bea grabbed her toolbox, a hefty metal behemoth nearly as old as the house itself, and hopped out, the scent of brine and wet earth thick in the air.  This wasn't going to be a simple leaky faucet. Bea could feel it in her wrench-calloused hands.
