The biting wind whipped at Amelia "Ace" Reyes's flight jacket as she prepped the de Havilland Beaver for takeoff.  Dawn was just beginning to paint the jagged peaks of the Wrangell-St. Elias range with streaks of rose and gold, a breathtaking vista few ever witnessed.  McCarthy, Alaska, population 42, nestled in a glacial valley below, was still shrouded in pre-dawn blue.  The air crackled with the promise of a cold, clear day, perfect flying weather. Ace secured the cargo netting over the crates of medical supplies destined for the remote village of Chisana, a hundred miles east and accessible only by air.  She ran a gloved hand over the Beaverâ€™s weathered fuselage, a familiar ritual that provided both comfort and a quick systems check. This morning, however, a tremor of unease buzzed beneath the surface of her usual pre-flight calm.  The radio chatter from the nearby ranger station had mentioned unusual seismic activity in the mountains, something Ace, with years of flying experience in this unpredictable terrain, couldn't ignore.
