The biting November wind whipped across the desolate beach, stinging Amelia Reyesâ€™s cheeks and tugging at the edges of her thick, grey scarf.  Sand, black as charcoal and flecked with iridescent green sea glass, swirled around her ankles.  Reynisfjara beach, Iceland.  A landscape of stark beauty, mirroring the stark reality Amelia now faced. Her latest film, a passion project five years in the making, had bombed.  Spectacularly.  Critics had eviscerated it, audiences had stayed away in droves, and the studio heads were now circling like vultures, their disappointment thinly veiled as professional concern.  Amelia, however, felt nothing. Just a bone-deep numbness that settled over her like the encroaching Icelandic dusk. This was supposed to be her magnum opus, the film that cemented her place amongst the greats.  Instead, it had become her exile.  She'd come to this volcanic shore seeking inspiration, or perhaps just oblivion, the crashing waves a fitting soundtrack to the wreckage of her career.
