Elara Jane Peterson, affectionately known as "Ellie" by the toddlers clinging to her legs, sighed and surveyed the chaos.  Plastic dinosaurs engaged in epic battles on the brightly colored rug.  A tower of blocks swayed precariously, threatening to topple onto a giggling two-year-old attempting to scale it.  Sunlight streamed through the large windows overlooking Mrs. Higgins' meticulously manicured rose bushes, adding a touch of serenity to the otherwise boisterous scene. It was a Tuesday morning in the sleepy town of Harmony Creek, and while the world outside might have been calm, inside Rainbow Rascals, it was a whirlwind of tiny humans and untamed energy. Ellie adjusted the paint-splattered apron tied around her waist and braced herself.  Naptime was over, and the real adventure was just beginning.
