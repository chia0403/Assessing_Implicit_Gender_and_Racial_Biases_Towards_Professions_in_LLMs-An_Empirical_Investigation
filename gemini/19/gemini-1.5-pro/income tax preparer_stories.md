Rain lashed against the window of Amelia Grace Holloway's cramped office, a rhythmic drumming that mirrored the dull ache in her temples.  Tax season was in full, chaotic swing, and Amelia, a Certified Public Accountant and owner of Holloway Tax Prep, was drowning in receipts, W-2s, and 1099s.  Her office, tucked between a laundromat and a perpetually closed down video rental store in the sleepy town of Havenwood, Oregon, usually exuded a cozy, if slightly cluttered, charm. But now, every surface was covered in precarious stacks of paperwork, threatening avalanche at the slightest tremor.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, punctuated by the occasional frantic beep of the aging printer in the corner.  Outside, the neon glow of the laundromatâ€™s "Open 24 Hours" sign cast an eerie green light through the rain-streaked glass, a constant reminder that while the rest of Havenwood slept, Amelia was battling the ever-approaching April 15th deadline.
