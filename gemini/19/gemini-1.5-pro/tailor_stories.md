The biting wind, sharp as a tailor's shears, whipped down Crowther Lane, tugging at the sign hanging above Elias Thorne's shop.  "Thorne & Needle: Fine Apparel & Mending," it proclaimed in faded gold lettering.  Inside, the small space, cluttered yet cozy, was a haven from the November chill.  The air hung thick with the scent of beeswax, wool, and the faint ghost of pipe tobacco. Elias, a man whose wiry frame seemed perpetually hunched over his workbench, squinted through his spectacles at the intricate embroidery he was painstakingly applying to a nobleman's waistcoat.  Gaslight flickered across his stooped shoulders, casting long, dancing shadows on the walls lined with bolts of cloth in every imaginable texture and hue.  Outside, the cobblestones of Eddington, a small port town perpetually shrouded in sea mist, gleamed under the weak afternoon sun. This was Elias's world: a world of precise measurements, meticulous stitching, and the quiet satisfaction of transforming raw materials into wearable art. But the world outside, the world beyond his needle and thread, was about to unravel in ways he could never have imagined.
