The bell above the door of "Nailed It," a tiny salon tucked between a laundromat and a perpetually-closed psychic's office, jingled merrily.  Rain lashed against the window, blurring the neon glow of the "Open" sign. Cassandra "Cassie" Bellweather, her name tag slightly askew on her fuchsia smock, sighed, pushing a stray strand of fire-engine red hair out of her eyes.  The aroma of acetone and lavender hung thick in the air, a familiar comfort against the dreary November afternoon in downtown Grimsborough. The only other occupant of the salon was Mrs. Higgins, a regular, whose arthritic fingers were currently enjoying a paraffin wax treatment. The silence, broken only by the gentle hum of the nail dryer, was about to be shattered.
