The flickering fluorescent lights of the Zenith Corporation Research and Development wing buzzed like trapped wasps, casting a sickly yellow glow across the deserted lab.  Elias Thorne, his name tag slightly askew on his faded blue uniform, pushed his mop bucket down the gleaming tiled hallway, the squeaky wheels a lonely counterpoint to the hum.

Tonight, however, a different sound, a faint, rhythmic clicking, emanated from Lab 42, a room usually sealed tighter than a drum and strictly off-limits to janitorial staff.  Elias, a man of routine and ingrained caution, hesitated, his hand hovering over the door handle. Lab 42.  The rumours surrounding it whispered through the night shift like a phantom draft - whispers of groundbreaking AI, of self-aware machines, of projects so secret even the scientists working on them didn't know the full picture.
