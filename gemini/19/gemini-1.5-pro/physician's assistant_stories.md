The biting November wind whipped at Amelia "Amy" Reyes's ankles as she hurried across the cobbled courtyard of St. Jude's Community Clinic, the scent of woodsmoke and decaying leaves thick in the air.  Tucked between a struggling bookstore and a perpetually closed antique shop in the heart of Old Town Ashworth, the clinic was a beacon of warm light and practicality in the otherwise fading grandeur of the historic district.  The building itself, a converted Victorian mansion, retained its original stained-glass windows and ornate gingerbread trim, now oddly juxtaposed with the sterile glow of fluorescent lights emanating from within. Amy clutched her thermos tighter, her breath misting in the frigid air as she reached for the heavy oak door, the brass nameplate gleaming beneath the porch light:  *St. Jude's Community Clinic - Serving Ashworth since 1927*.  Tonight, like every Tuesday night for the past three years, Amy was on call, bracing herself for the unpredictable tapestry of ailments and emergencies that walked, limped, or were wheeled through the clinic doors.  Tonight, however, a different kind of chill ran down her spine â€“ a premonition that this shift wouldn't be like the others.
