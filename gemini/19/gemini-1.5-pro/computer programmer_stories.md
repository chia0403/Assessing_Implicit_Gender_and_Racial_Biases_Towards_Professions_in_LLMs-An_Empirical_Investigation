Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Elias Thorne's apartment, blurring the already fading neon glow of Neo-Kyoto's skyline. The 27th floor offered a spectacular view, usually. Tonight, it was just a swirling canvas of grey and electric blue.  Inside, the apartment was a stark contrast to the chaos outside.  Minimalist, almost sterile, the only colour came from the pulsating LED strips under Elias's custom-built workstation.  Three monitors displayed lines of intricate code, a digital fortress Elias was painstakingly constructing. Empty ramen containers littered the desk, testament to a long night wrestling with a particularly stubborn algorithm. Elias, clad in a worn hoodie and fingerless gloves, ran a hand through his perpetually messy dark hair, his brow furrowed in concentration. He was close, he could feel it. Just a few more lines of code and he’d crack the encryption… or so he hoped.  The encrypted file, a cryptic message from an anonymous source, had landed in his inbox three days ago, and had consumed him ever since.
