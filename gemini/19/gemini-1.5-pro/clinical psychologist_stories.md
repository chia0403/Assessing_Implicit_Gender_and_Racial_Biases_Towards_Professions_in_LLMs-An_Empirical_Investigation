Rain lashed against the mullioned windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's office, mimicking the relentless drumming in his temples. The scent of damp wool and old books clung to the air, a comforting familiarity in the otherwise oppressive atmosphere. His consulting room, tucked away on the second floor of a converted Georgian townhouse in the historic district of Bath, England, usually exuded a sense of calm. Tonight, however, the flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows that seemed to mock the meticulously arranged antique furniture and the carefully curated collection of framed botanical prints.  Elias, his dark hair threaded with silver at the temples, steepled his fingers, his gaze fixed on the vacant leather armchair across from his desk. He was waiting for his last patient of the day, a new referral shrouded in an unsettling level of secrecy.  The only information he had received was a cryptic message from a colleague in London, referring to a "case of peculiar psychological distress" and the patient's name:  Seraphina Bellweather.
