The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne as he locked up his practice, Thorne Family Dentistry.  The neon "Open" sign flickered and died, leaving the small brick building bathed in the orange glow of the streetlights that lined Elm Street in Harmony Creek, Pennsylvania.  Fallen leaves, the color of rust and burnt umber, skittered across the sidewalk, chased by gusts that seemed to carry the whispers of approaching winter. Harmony Creek, population 3,248, was the kind of town where everyone knew your name, your business, and probably the state of your dental hygiene. Elias, having grown up there, knew this intimately. He pulled his collar higher, the scent of woodsmoke and decaying leaves filling his nostrils, a familiar aroma that always reminded him of childhood Halloweens and bonfires by the creek.  Tonight, however, the familiar comfort was edged with a sense of unease. He couldn't shake the feeling that something in Harmony Creek, something in the very air, had shifted.
