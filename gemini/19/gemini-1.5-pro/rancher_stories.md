The wind, a relentless sculptor, had carved deep lines into Elias Vanceâ€™s face, mirroring the furrows it plowed across his Montana ranch.  Dust devils danced across the parched earth, kicking up the scent of sagebrush and the faint, metallic tang of impending rain.  The sky, a bruised purple, hung heavy over the sprawling Vance property, the Lazy V, which stretched from the base of the craggy Bitterroot Mountains to the meandering, muddy banks of the Clark Fork River.  Elias, his calloused hands gripping the reins of his paint horse, Apollo, surveyed his land with a mixture of pride and weary resignation.  The drought had been brutal this year, turning the normally lush pastureland into a brittle, yellow expanse.  The cattle were growing thin, their ribs visible beneath their hides, and the usually boisterous mooing had been replaced by a low, anxious rumble.  This wasn't just a bad season; it felt like the land itself was holding its breath, waiting for a salvation that seemed less and less likely to arrive.
