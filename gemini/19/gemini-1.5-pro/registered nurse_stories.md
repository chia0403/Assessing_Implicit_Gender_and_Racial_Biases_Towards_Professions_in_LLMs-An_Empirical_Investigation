The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne's auburn braid across her face as she hurried across the cobbled courtyard of St. Jude's Hospital.  Gargoyles perched atop the aged stone walls leered down at her, their frozen expressions mirroring the anxiety churning in her stomach.  Built in 1888, the hospital loomed like a gothic behemoth against the bruised twilight sky of Boston.  Inside its labyrinthine corridors, shadows danced with the flickering gaslight sconces, casting an eerie glow on the polished mahogany floors.  Amelia, despite her six years of dedicated service within its walls, still felt a prickle of unease whenever she walked the night shift. Tonight, however, the unease was sharper, colder, laced with a premonition she couldn't quite shake.  The emergency telegram summoning her back from a rare evening off had been cryptic, mentioning only a "critical situation" and the name of a patient she'd never encountered before.
