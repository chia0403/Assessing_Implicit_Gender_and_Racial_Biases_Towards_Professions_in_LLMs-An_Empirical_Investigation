The salt spray kissed Elara Vivienne Moreau's face as she perched precariously on the cliff edge, her easel braced against the wind. Below her, the turquoise waters of the Aegean Sea churned against the volcanic rock of Santorini.  Whitewashed houses, clinging to the caldera like barnacles, tumbled down towards the sapphire harbour, a cascade of sugar cubes against the rich, dark earth.  The late afternoon sun, a hazy orange orb sinking towards the horizon, painted the sky in fiery hues of apricot and rose, casting long shadows across the terraced vineyards that carpeted the slopes.  Elara, her chestnut hair escaping its braid and whipping around her face, squinted, trying to capture the ephemeral light on her canvas.  This was her favourite time of day, the hour when the world held its breath, poised between the vibrancy of day and the mystery of the approaching night.  It was a fleeting moment, a whisper of magic, and she was determined to make it hers.
