The flickering neon sign of the Starlight Diner cast a lurid, greasy glow across the rain-slicked asphalt of Bleecker Street. Detective Isabella “Izzy” Diaz, her trench coat plastered to her like a second skin, shivered and pulled the collar tighter.  November in Greenwich Village had a way of seeping into your bones, a damp, relentless chill that mirrored the knot of unease tightening in her gut.  The call had come in just after 2 am: a possible 10-45, a dead body, in the alley behind the diner.  Izzy’s partner, Detective Marcus Bell, was already on scene, his silhouette a dark smudge against the flashing blue and red lights of the patrol cars. The air hung thick with the smell of burnt coffee and something else, something metallic and faintly sweet, that made the hairs on the back of Izzy’s neck prickle. This wasn’t going to be a good night.
