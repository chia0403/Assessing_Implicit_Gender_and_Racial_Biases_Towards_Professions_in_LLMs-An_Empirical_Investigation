The biting wind whipped across the desolate expanse of the Cairngorms National Park, stinging Amelia "Mia" MacIntyre's cheeks and turning her breath into fleeting clouds.  The late November sky, a bruise-coloured canvas streaked with icy grey, threatened snow.  Below her, nestled in a sheltered glen carpeted with frost-kissed heather, lay the Highland Wildlife Rescue Centre.  A cluster of weathered wooden buildings huddled together, radiating the warm glow of lamplight against the gathering gloom. Mia, head animal caretaker and the centre's only permanent resident, pulled her thick wool scarf tighter around her neck, the scent of pine and damp earth filling her lungs.  From the nearby aviary, the lonely hoot of a tawny owl echoed through the twilight, a sound both mournful and comforting in the vast emptiness of the Highlands.  Tonight, however, the usual tranquility was shattered. A frantic phone call from a local farmer had spoken of a creature unlike any Mia had ever encountered, injured and alone, high on the slopes of Ben Macdui.  And Mia, as always, was the only one who could help.
