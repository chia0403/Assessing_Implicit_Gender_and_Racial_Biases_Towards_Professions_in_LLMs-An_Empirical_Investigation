The biting November wind whipped around Eleanor Vance, stinging her cheeks and tugging at the loose strands of her auburn braid. Grey clouds, heavy with the promise of snow, scudded low over the brooding peaks of the Vermont Green Mountains.  Eleanor pulled her thick wool coat tighter around herself, the crunch of frozen leaves beneath her boots echoing in the pre-dawn stillness. She paused on the porch of the rambling Victorian farmhouse, its paint peeling like sunburnt skin, and took a deep breath of the crisp air.  This was her third week at Maplewood Manor, a rehabilitation center nestled deep in the isolated Cavendish Valley, and while the stark beauty of the landscape captivated her, a persistent unease lingered beneath the surface. The isolation was palpable, the silence broken only by the distant rush of the Black River and the mournful creak of the old house settling. Eleanor, an occupational therapist fresh from bustling Boston,  had come seeking solace and a change of pace, but she was beginning to suspect she’d found something else entirely.  Something…unsettling.
