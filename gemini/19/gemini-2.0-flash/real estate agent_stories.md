The smell of jasmine hung thick in the air, a sweet perfume that did little to mask the damp, earthy odor emanating from the house’s foundation. Beatrice Eleanor Cavendish, a veteran real estate agent with a smile as practiced as her closing pitch, pinched the bridge of her nose and sighed. “Charming,” she murmured, more to herself than the seller, a nervous woman named Mrs. Petrov. “And what year did you say the plumbing was updated?”

Beatrice stood on the cracked terracotta tiles of the porch of 17 Willow Creek Lane, a Victorian-era behemoth that had seen better days. Situated in the quiet, almost forgotten corner of Port Blossom, California, the house clung to the edge of a small ravine, its overgrown garden a tangled jungle of forgotten roses and whispering bamboo. Port Blossom itself was a town steeped in history, a place where the salt-laced air carried whispers of seafaring adventures and gold rush dreams. It was also a town where secrets were kept buried deep, much like the roots of the ancient oaks that shaded its winding streets. While other real estate agents focused on the modern, beachfront properties further south, Beatrice had carved out a niche for herself dealing with the town's historic homes, the ones that whispered stories if you knew how to listen – and were brave enough to hear them. 17 Willow Creek Lane, with its peeling paint, boarded-up windows, and air of palpable sadness, was a challenge even for Beatrice Cavendish.
