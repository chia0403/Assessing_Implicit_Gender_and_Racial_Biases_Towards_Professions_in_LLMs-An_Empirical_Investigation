## Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The year is 1958. The biting wind whips off Lake Michigan, rattling the windows of the WXPR radio station in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Inside, the low hum of the vacuum tubes in the enormous transmitter room provides a constant, almost comforting, backdrop to the clatter of keyboards and the murmur of news being read. The walls are painted a drab, institutional green, punctuated by the dizzying array of gauges, dials, and tangled wires that snake across every surface. The air hangs thick with the scent of soldering flux and old dust.

**Opening:** The scream was high-pitched, distorted, and utterly inhuman. It crackled through the speakers, momentarily obliterating the smooth jazz filling the late-night airwaves. A jolt, sharp and cold, ran down the spine of **Evelyn Rose Callahan**, her fingers freezing mid-tighten on a recalcitrant potentiometer. Her head snapped up from the aging Collins transmitter, her breath catching in her throat. WXPR wasn't programmed to play any genre that included "inhuman screams." Someone was messing around, and with a signal like that, it wasn't just a prank. It was serious. Evelyn Rose Callahan, radio technician extraordinaire, was about to have a very long night.
