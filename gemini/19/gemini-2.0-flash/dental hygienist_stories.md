The rhythmic whir of the Cavitron scaler buzzed in the sterile air, a sound Amelia “Amy” Josephine Hernandez had grown so accustomed to she barely registered it anymore. Not on days like today, anyway, when Mrs. Gable was regaling her with the lurid details of her cat Mr. Whiskers’ escapades in the local catnip patch. 

Amelia, perched on her ergonomic stool, gently maneuvered the scaler around Mrs. Gable’s lower incisors, careful to avoid the gum line. Sunlight streamed through the oversized window of her little operatory in Dr. Peterson’s Family Dentistry, a cheerful, if slightly dated, practice in the heart of Willow Creek, Montana.
