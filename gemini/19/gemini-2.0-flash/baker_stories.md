## Opening:

The clock above the perpetually frosted pastry case ticked with a slow, deliberate rhythm, each tick echoing the nervous flutter in Eleanor Beatrice Crumb's chest. The aroma of warm cinnamon rolls and melting butter, usually a source of comfort, felt suffocating. Today was different. Today, the fate of "Eleanor's Edibles," her tiny, beloved bakery, rested on a single, intricately decorated gingerbread house.

## Setting:

"Eleanor's Edibles" nestled on the corner of Poppy Lane in the quaint, undeniably charming town of Willow Creek, Maine. The building itself was a symphony of pastel colours – a pale butter yellow exterior trimmed with mint green shutters and a lavender-painted door. Inside, the scent of vanilla and sugar hung heavy in the air, clinging to the mismatched furniture and the hand-painted murals depicting whimsical woodland creatures baking tiny pies. Sunlight streamed through the lace-curtained windows, illuminating the rows of perfectly crafted cakes, cookies, and pastries that lined the shelves. A chalkboard menu, adorned with Eleanor's looping cursive, offered a rotating selection of seasonal delights. In the back, a cozy kitchen, overflowing with baking paraphernalia – copper pots, wooden spoons, and mountains of sprinkles – served as Eleanor's happy place, her sanctuary from the world. But today, even the familiar comfort of her kitchen couldn't quite quell the anxiety that churned within her. The Willow Creek Winter Festival Gingerbread Competition was about to begin. And Eleanor Beatrice Crumb had poured her heart, soul, and an ungodly amount of royal icing into what she hoped would be a winning masterpiece.
