The setting was the perpetually sun-drenched village of Petra, nestled at the foot of Mount Astraeus. Whitewashed houses clung to the hillside like stubborn barnacles, their terracotta roofs mirroring the rust-colored scree that cascaded down the mountainâ€™s slopes. The air, thick with the scent of wild thyme and the faint, earthy tang of freshly cut stone, buzzed with the ceaseless chirping of cicadas. Petra was, quite simply, built on stone. Its very foundations were carved from Astraeus's bones, and its prosperity flowed from the nimble hands of its stonecutters.

At the edge of the village, where the first, rough-hewn steps led up the mountain, stood the workshop of Theron Elias Dimitriou. It was a humble affair, little more than a stone shack with a canvas awning offering meagre shade. Inside, the air was thick with dust, swirling in the shafts of sunlight that pierced the gloom. Hammers, chisels, and mallets lay scattered amongst half-finished statues and piles of discarded stone. Theron, his brow perpetually furrowed in concentration, was bent over a block of marble, the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of his hammer echoing through the quiet afternoon. He was a man carved from the same sturdy stock as the mountains themselves: lean, weathered, and strong.
