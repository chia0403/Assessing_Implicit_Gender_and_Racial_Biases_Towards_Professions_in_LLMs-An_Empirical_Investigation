## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The perpetual dawn of Reykjavik, Iceland, in late October. The air is crisp, thick with the smell of the Atlantic and the faint, earthy aroma of geothermal heating. Puddles shimmer with reflected light from the brightly colored buildings lining Austurstræti, the city's oldest street, just beginning to stir.

**Story Opening:**

A low, mournful hum resonated from the depths of Blómabúðin Rós (Rose Flower Shop), a sound as familiar to Rosalind Elísabet Ólafsdóttir as the rhythm of her own heart. It was the overworked compressor in her vintage floral cooler, groaning under the strain of preserving delicate orchids and hardy Icelandic heather. Rosalind shivered, pulling her thick wool cardigan tighter around her as she unlocked the heavy oak door of the shop. The first rays of the weak Icelandic sun, a pale gold washing over the cobblestones, barely pierced the gloom within. She flicked on the overhead lights, a series of Edison bulbs strung across the ceiling, bathing the space in a warm, inviting glow. It was 6:00 AM, far too early for most of Reykjavik to consider moving, but for Rosalind, it was already time to coax beauty from the raw materials nature provided, a task she approached with a mixture of reverence and quiet desperation. The phone, an ancient rotary dial that stubbornly refused to be replaced, rang just as she was beginning to arrange a bouquet of crimson carnations. The insistent, jarring ring cut through the quiet hum of the cooler, a discordant note in the symphony of her morning ritual. Rosalind sighed, a puff of white breath clouding in the chilled air. It was never good news calling at this hour.
