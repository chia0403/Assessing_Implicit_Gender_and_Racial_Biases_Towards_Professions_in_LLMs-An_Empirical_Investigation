Okay, here's a story opening and setting with the details you requested:

**Setting:** The sprawling, yet meticulously kept, grounds of Blackwood Manor, a Gothic Revival estate perched on the bluffs overlooking the tumultuous Atlantic Ocean.  The manor itself was all grey stone and shadowed gables, constantly battered by the salty winds and shrouded in mist. A network of winding pathways, bordered by meticulously trimmed hedges, snaked through the formal gardens, past ancient, gnarled trees and bubbling fountains choked with ivy. In contrast to the wildness of the ocean view, Blackwood Manor exuded an air of oppressive order.  It felt, in every stone and sculpted plant, like a place clinging desperately to the past.

**Opening:**

"Another damn rose," sighed Barnaby "Barney" Finch, wiping a bead of sweat from his brow with the back of his calloused hand. He straightened, groaning slightly as his spine protested the repetitive bending and pruning.  He held the severed rose stem, its thorns a crimson menace, aloft, inspecting it with a practiced eye.  Black spot.  The bane of his existence, and seemingly, the only thing thriving in this godforsaken patch of earth. For fifteen years, Barney had waged a silent war against the black spot, against the relentless weeds that dared to trespass on Mrs. Blackwood's manicured lawns, and against the mournful cries of the gulls that seemed to mock his efforts from the craggy cliffs below.

The scent of the sea hung heavy in the air, mingling with the sickly-sweet perfume of the afflicted roses. Barney squinted up at the looming silhouette of Blackwood Manor against the overcast sky.  It wasn't a home, not really. It was a mausoleum, a monument to a family history as twisted and thorny as the rose bushes he battled daily. He knew, deep down, that something was wrong at Blackwood Manor, something beyond just horticultural challenges.  It wasn’t just the constant gloom or the whispers that echoed through the empty halls (whispers he’d dismissed as the wind for years).  It was a feeling, a cold dread that settled in his bones whenever he stepped beyond the gate. But Barney Finch was a practical man. He had a job to do, and he would damn well see it done, even if it meant wrestling with the ghosts of Blackwood Manor itself.
