Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a clinical psychologist:

**Setting:**

A sprawling, century-old Victorian house perched precariously on a bluff overlooking the Pacific Ocean in Mendocino, California. Known locally as "Seacliff Manor," the house boasts a history as tumultuous and layered as the shifting fog that frequently blankets the coastline. Its exterior is a study in faded grandeur, with peeling paint, overgrown ivy clawing at the turret, and salt-stained windows that offer breathtaking views. Inside, the house is a warren of dimly lit rooms filled with antique furniture, dusty bookshelves crammed with weighty tomes, and the unsettling quiet that only a very old, mostly empty house can possess. The air is thick with the scent of damp wood, sea salt, and a faint, lingering fragrance of lavender.

**Story Opening:**

Dr. Eleanor Abigail Vance shivered, pulling her thick wool cardigan tighter around her. The foghorn's mournful bellow echoed across the water, a sound that always seemed to burrow deep inside her bones in this place. Outside the leaded glass window of her new office, the wind whipped the cypress trees into a frenzy. It was a fitting soundtrack for the unraveling she hoped to prevent.

Eleanor ran a hand through her short, silver-streaked hair, a nervous habit she'd been unable to shake since residency. This was it. Seacliff Manor was now her home, her practice, her sanctuary – or perhaps, her prison. After years of working in the sterile, brightly-lit confines of urban clinics, she'd taken a leap of faith, buying this dilapidated behemoth with the last of her inheritance and a hefty mortgage.

She’d envisioned a haven, a place where troubled souls could find solace amidst the dramatic beauty of the coastline. A place where the rhythm of the ocean, the ancient whispers of the redwoods, and her own well-honed skills could work their magic. But the reality of Seacliff Manor was proving far more… unsettling than the brochures had suggested.

The first patient wasn't due for another hour, but Eleanor couldn't shake the feeling she was being watched. Not by some unseen entity, but by the house itself. It was a feeling that had been growing since she had first stepped foot inside, a silent, persistent hum of unease that vibrated through the floorboards and echoed in the high ceilings. She hoped it was just the pre-therapy jitters, magnified by the oppressive atmosphere of Seacliff Manor, and not a premonition of the darkness that lurked beneath the surface of this seemingly idyllic town.
