## The Smell of Sawdust and Regret

**Opening:**

The scent of cedar hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort that did little to soothe the ache in Elias James Harding's bones. He ran a calloused hand over the smooth, unfinished surface of the rocking horse, his fingers tracing the delicate curve of its neck. It was a beautiful piece, perhaps the finest he'd ever crafted. Yet, as he stared at the empty seat, meant for a child who would likely never sit in it, a bitter taste rose in his throat. He hadn't felt joy crafting this, only a hollow echo of what could have been.

**Setting:**

Elias's workshop, a small, cluttered space attached to the back of his modest clapboard house, sat just outside the sleepy coastal town of Oakhaven, Maine. The air was thick with the salty tang of the ocean, mingling with the sweet fragrance of wood shavings. Tools hung from every available wall, meticulously organized according to their purpose – saws of varying sizes, chisels gleaming with years of sharpening, planes smoothed with constant use. A pot-bellied stove sat in the corner, radiating a comforting warmth that barely penetrated the drafts whistling through the gaps in the weathered walls. Sunlight streamed through a large window, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the air and highlighting the intricate grain of the various woods stacked against one wall – cherry, oak, maple, and the ubiquitous cedar, all patiently waiting to be transformed into something new. The workshop was a reflection of Elias himself: skilled, well-worn, and harboring a quiet, enduring loneliness.
