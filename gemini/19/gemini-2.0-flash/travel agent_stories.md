## Story Opening:

The turquoise water of the brochure mocked Eleanor Vivian Hawthorne. It swirled, impossibly perfect, around a thatched-roof bungalow that practically screamed "idyllic escape." Eleanor, trapped in the fluorescent hum of "Hawthorne's Horizons - Your Dreams, Our Destinations," felt anything but idyllic. In fact, she felt a distinct ache in her lower back and a rising tide of dread. Mr. Henderson, perched precariously on the edge of the client chair, was droning on about all-inclusive resorts, his voice a nasal whine that threatened to shatter the fragile tranquility Eleanor usually projected.

"Now, Mrs. Hawthorne, you understand I want top-shelf liquor included. None of that watered-down swill. And the beach has to be pristine. No seaweed, no pebbles, no…well, you get the picture. It needs to be the kind of beach where you can see your own toes wiggling in the water."

Eleanor suppressed a sigh. She'd heard it all before. Pristine beaches, top-shelf liquor, five-star everything. It was the currency of her world, the traded promise of escape for people who were already quite comfortable, thank you very much. But lately, the escape she craved wasn't for a client. It was for herself. The endless cycle of booking flights, negotiating hotel deals, and crafting the perfect itinerary had become a gilded cage, each meticulously planned vacation highlighting the vast, unexplored territory of her own life.

## Setting:

The setting is "Hawthorne's Horizons," a travel agency located in the quaint, slightly pretentious downtown area of Maplewood, Connecticut. The agency occupies the ground floor of a Victorian building, its large bay windows plastered with colourful posters showcasing exotic destinations: the Eiffel Tower, the Great Wall of China, the pyramids of Egypt. Inside, the décor is designed to evoke a sense of adventure, with framed maps, vintage travel posters, and a rotating globe in the corner. However, the effect is somewhat diminished by the beige walls, the worn-out carpeting, and the ever-present scent of stale coffee and desperation. Eleanor's desk is a controlled chaos of brochures, airline timetables, and sticky notes covered in shorthand. The overall impression is one of slightly faded glamour, a testament to a bygone era of luxury travel that is struggling to stay relevant in the age of online booking and budget airlines. The afternoon sunlight streams through the windows, highlighting the dust motes dancing in the air, adding a touch of melancholy to the already subdued atmosphere.
