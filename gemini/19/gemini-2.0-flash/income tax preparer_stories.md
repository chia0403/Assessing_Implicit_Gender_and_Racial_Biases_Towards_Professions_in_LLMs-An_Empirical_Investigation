Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring an income tax preparer:

**Setting:** The office of "A Taxing Matter," nestled in a strip mall just off Main Street in the sleepy town of Harmony Creek, Ohio. The year is 2024, late March, and the air outside smells faintly of wet mulch and the promise of spring. Inside, the fluorescent lights hum with a nervous energy, reflecting off the laminate surfaces and the overflowing filing cabinets that threaten to spill their contents onto the worn, floral-patterned carpet.

**Opening:**

Margaret Eleanor Pruitt, a woman whose life was as meticulously organized as the tax forms she loved to dissect, hadn't slept properly in a week. It wasn't the avalanche of forms threatening to bury her alive at "A Taxing Matter," though that certainly contributed. No, Margaret's insomnia stemmed from Mrs. Higgins' receipts. Mrs. Higgins, a sweet, albeit slightly dotty, widow who insisted on claiming her cat, Mr. Whiskers, as a "dependent." Margaret had explained, patiently, that the IRS generally didn't recognize feline dependents, even exceptionally fluffy ones, but Mrs. Higgins remained unconvinced. Now, staring at the ceiling at 3:17 AM, Margaret could practically *feel* the judgmental gaze of the IRS auditors boring into her soul. And it all started with Mr. Whiskers' supposed "medical expenses" for a tiny sweater vest.
