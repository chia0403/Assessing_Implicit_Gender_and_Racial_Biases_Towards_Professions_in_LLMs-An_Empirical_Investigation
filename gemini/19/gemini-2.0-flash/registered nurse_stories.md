The biting wind off Lake Michigan clawed at Amelia Grace Harrison's exposed cheeks as she hurried across the parking lot. The January sky was a bruised purple, threatening more snow. Her shift at St. Jude's Emergency Room was already a half hour overdue to start, and the usual knot of guilt was tightening in her stomach. Late meant someone else had to cover longer, someone elseâ€™s dinner getting cold, someone else's kids missing out on story time.

St. Jude's, a sprawling brick behemoth, sat perched on the edge of Milwaukee's Third Ward. It was a place of constant motion, of flashing lights and hurried whispers, a pressure cooker of human vulnerability simmering twenty-four hours a day. Inside, the sterile scent of antiseptic fought a losing battle against the undercurrent of sickness, fear, and something Amelia recognized as despair. The fluorescent lights buzzed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the countless dramas unfolding within its walls.

Tonight, Amelia knew, would be no different.
