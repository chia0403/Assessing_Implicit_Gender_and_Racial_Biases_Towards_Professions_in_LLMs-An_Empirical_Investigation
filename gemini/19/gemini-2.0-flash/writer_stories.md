## Story Opening:

The clatter of keys was a relentless counterpoint to the crashing waves outside. Arthur Finch, a writer perpetually at war with his own ambition, hammered away at his laptop, the glow reflecting in his tired, perpetually bloodshot eyes. He'd been wrestling with this particular sentence, a seemingly innocuous description of a seashell, for the better part of an hour. "The conch, smooth and pearlescent, lay..." Lay what, damn it? Lay silently? Lay patiently? Lay like a discarded dream on the beach of his own literary failure? He groaned, running a hand through his already disheveled grey hair. He hadn't had a decent night's sleep in weeks, fuelled only by lukewarm coffee and the gnawing fear that this, his latest manuscript, would be the one to finally prove he was a fraud.

## Setting:

The setting is a small, ramshackle cottage perched precariously on the edge of a cliff in the remote coastal town of Port Sorrow, Cornwall. The cottage, christened "The Lookout" by its former owner, is a weathered testament to the unforgiving power of the Atlantic. The walls are thick stone, perpetually damp and smelling faintly of salt and mildew. Inside, the d√©cor is a mismatched collection of antique furniture salvaged from various estate sales and charity shops. A large, antique writing desk dominates the living room, littered with overflowing ashtrays, empty coffee mugs, and stacks of research books teetering on the edge of chaos. The only redeeming feature is the panoramic view of the churning ocean, visible through a large, arched window that frames the dramatic coastline. The constant roar of the waves, the mournful cry of the seagulls, and the relentless wind create a sense of isolation and wild beauty that both inspires and terrifies Arthur in equal measure.
