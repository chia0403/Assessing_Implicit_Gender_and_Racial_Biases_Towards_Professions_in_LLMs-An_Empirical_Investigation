Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring an exercise instructor:

**Setting:**

The humid Florida air hung thick and heavy, a tangible blanket clinging to everything outside. Inside "Sweat Equity," a small but fiercely popular fitness studio in St. Petersburg, the air was artificially crisp, smelling faintly of citrus cleaner and the faint, persistent aroma of sweat. Sunlight streamed through the large, mirrored windows, glinting off rows of meticulously arranged weights and the polished wooden floor. The walls were painted a vibrant coral, meant to energize, but on mornings like this, it felt more like a visual assault.

**Opening:**

"Alright, people, give me five!" bellowed Gwendolyn "Gwen" Eleanor Davis, clapping her hands with enough force to startle a nearby flock of seagulls. Her voice, usually a warm, encouraging balm, had an extra edge of pep this morning. She knew, deep down, that getting this group moving would be an uphill battle. Monday mornings in July were always a test of willpower, a battle against the siren song of air conditioning and Netflix.

Gwen, a woman built like a particularly toned brick house, surveyed her class. A mix of regulars and bewildered-looking tourists stared back, their faces ranging from vaguely hopeful to outright terrified. Her own expression was fixed in a sunny, determined smile, the kind that could convince you that burpees were actually *fun*. Gwen adjusted the microphone headset nestled in her honey-blonde hair, giving a quick, reassuring nod to Mrs. Henderson, a retiree who always positioned herself strategically near the exit. It was time to get moving.
