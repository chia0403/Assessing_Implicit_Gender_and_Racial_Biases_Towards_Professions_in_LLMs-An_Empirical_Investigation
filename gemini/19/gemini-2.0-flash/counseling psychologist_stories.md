## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** A sprawling, sun-drenched Victorian house, converted into the "Harmony Counseling Collective" in the affluent, but subtly quirky, town of Hollow Creek, Vermont. The exterior boasts a wrap-around porch adorned with hanging baskets overflowing with petunias and a meticulously manicured lawn. Inside, the rooms are painted in soothing shades of sage green and lavender, furnished with mismatched antique furniture and cozy, overstuffed armchairs. The air is thick with the scent of lavender and the low hum of a white noise machine, strategically placed in the hallway to muffle the occasional sob or raised voice.

**Story Opening:**

Dr. Eleanor Marguerite Ainsworth adjusted her glasses, the gold frames catching the late afternoon sun streaming through the tall, arched window of her office. A half-eaten apple sat on her desk next to a stack of case files, each a carefully curated collection of anxieties, traumas, and dreams. The silence of the room, usually a balm to her weary soul, felt heavy today. Her last client, a young artist grappling with crippling self-doubt, had left only ten minutes ago, and the echoes of his vulnerability still hung in the air, clinging to the tapestry rug like a lingering perfume. Eleanor sighed, pushing back from her mahogany desk. Another day, another tapestry woven with the threads of other people's pain. She rubbed the bridge of her nose, feeling the familiar ache of empathy tightening her temples. Perhaps a cup of chamomile tea was in order. Or, maybe, just maybe, sheâ€™d finally take Mrs. Gable up on her offer of that rhubarb pie. Anything to escape the quiet, the quiet that amplified the unsettling feeling that had been nagging at her all week, a feeling that whispered of something lurking just beneath the placid surface of Hollow Creek. Something more sinister than mere existential dread.
