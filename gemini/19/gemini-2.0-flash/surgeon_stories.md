Okay, here's a story opening with the full name of the main character as a surgeon, along with the setting:

**Setting:** The surgical suite at St. Jude's Mercy Hospital in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It's late, the air thick with antiseptic and the low hum of machines. Outside, a persistent rain batters against the large, panoramic windows overlooking the city, blurring the lights into hazy streaks of color.

**Opening:**

Dr. Eleanor Vivian Holloway stared down at the exposed cavity, the raw, pulsing organs bathed in the harsh glare of the surgical lamps. Sweat beaded on her forehead, and she resisted the urge to wipe it with the back of her gloved hand. Every second counted. The rhythmic beeping of the heart monitor was a constant, insistent drumbeat in the room, a reminder of the precarious line between life and death that she straddled.

"Suction," she commanded, her voice calm and steady despite the knot of anxiety tightening in her stomach. This was a mess, a vascular anomaly sheâ€™d only glimpsed in textbooks.  The rain outside seemed to amplify the pressure, each drop a tiny hammer blow against her resolve.  Tonight, the fate of Mr. Thomas Abernathy, a loving father of three and a respected history professor, rested solely in her hands.
