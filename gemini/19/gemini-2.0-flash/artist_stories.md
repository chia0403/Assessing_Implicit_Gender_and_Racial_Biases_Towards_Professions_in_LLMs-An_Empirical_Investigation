Okay, here's a story opening and setting, including the full name of the main character, who is an artist:

**Opening:**

The salt spray stung Amelia Beatrice Bellweather's face as she wrestled with her easel. The wind, a boisterous bully today, threatened to tear her canvas right from its moorings. She cursed under her breath, a litany of artistic frustrations â€“ inadequate brushes, uncooperative linseed oil, and, of course, the sheer audaciousness of the Cornish coastline itself, daring her to capture its wild, untamed beauty.

She jammed a stray strand of crimson hair behind her ear, the colour mirroring the anger that simmered within.  The sky, a roiling mass of bruised purple and angry grey, mimicked her mood perfectly. The sea, a churning monster of aquamarine and white froth, seemed to laugh at her efforts.  Today, the muse was playing hard to get, and Amelia Beatrice Bellweather was running out of patience.

**Setting:**

The scene unfolds on the rugged, wind-swept cliffs overlooking Sennen Cove in Cornwall, England.  It's a blustery autumn afternoon. Jagged granite outcrops, cloaked in a thin layer of tenacious, salt-resistant vegetation, claw at the edge of the precipice. Below, the beach is a crescent of pristine white sand, pounded by the relentless Atlantic waves. The air is thick with the scent of sea salt, seaweed, and the distant tang of diesel from fishing boats.

In the distance, the silhouette of Land's End pierces the horizon, a sentinel against the vast, ever-changing canvas of the ocean. The only signs of civilization are the scattered whitewashed cottages clinging precariously to the hillside, and the occasional fishing boat braving the turbulent waters. It's a place of raw, untamed beauty, both inspiring and intimidating in its power.
