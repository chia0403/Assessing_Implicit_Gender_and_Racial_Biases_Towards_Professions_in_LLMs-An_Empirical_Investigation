**Opening:**

The smell of lavender and desperation hung heavy in the air of Dr. Eleanor Vance’s waiting room, a familiar cocktail that always made her own back ache a little bit worse. A grandfather clock, ticking with the pompous rhythm of passing time, stood sentinel near a stack of dog-eared magazines – "Back Health Today," "National Geographic," and, inexplicably, a very old issue of "Cat Fancy." Eleanor sighed, pushing herself up from her own slightly-too-stiff chair behind the reception desk. She’d told Brenda, her receptionist, a dozen times to replace that chair, but Brenda insisted it gave the office "character." Eleanor suspected Brenda just enjoyed torturing her with the irony of a chiropractor with a bad chair.

**Setting:**

Eleanor Vance Chiropractic Care occupied a quaint, albeit slightly rundown, Victorian house on Elm Street in the heart of Havenwood, Massachusetts. Havenwood was the kind of town where everyone knew everyone else's business, the local bakery still used real butter, and the highlight of the year was the annual pumpkin festival. The house itself was painted a faded sage green with peeling white trim. Eleanor had inherited it from her grandfather, a renowned osteopath who had practiced within its walls for over fifty years. She'd tried to modernize the interior, replacing the chintz wallpaper with calming, neutral tones and adding state-of-the-art adjusting tables, but the house stubbornly clung to its old-fashioned charm. Sunlight streamed through the leaded glass windows, casting dappled shadows on the polished hardwood floors, imbuing the waiting room with a sense of tranquility, even if the air was thick with the anxieties of aching backs and pinched nerves.
