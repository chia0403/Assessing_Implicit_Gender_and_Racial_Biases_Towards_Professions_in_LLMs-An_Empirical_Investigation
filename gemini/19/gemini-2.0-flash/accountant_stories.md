The fluorescent lights of the office hummed a monotonous tune, a symphony of tedium that echoed the feeling in Bartholomew "Bart" Finch's soul. Another Tuesday. Another mountain of receipts threatening to topple onto his desk. Bart, a Certified Public Accountant, pushed his spectacles up the bridge of his nose, the gesture as automatic as breathing at this point. He was surrounded by stacks of invoices, spreadsheets blinking on his dual monitors like predatory eyes, and the faint scent of stale coffee clinging to the air.

His office, nestled on the 7th floor of the First National Bank Building in downtown Providence, Rhode Island, was a monument to beige. Beige walls, beige carpet, even a beige motivational poster featuring a stock photo of a sunrise over a mountain range. The only splash of color came from the overflowing mug of pens on his desk, a chaotic explosion of blues, greens, and reds that felt strangely rebellious amidst the oppressive monotony. Outside, the city was a blur of traffic and hurried footsteps, but inside, time seemed to move at a glacial pace, measured only by the ticking of the analog clock above his door and the rhythmic tap-tap-tapping of Bart's fingers against the worn surface of his mahogany desk. This was Bart Finch's sanctuary, his prison, and his livelihood all rolled into one beige-tinged package. And today, he was about to discover that even in the most predictable of environments, chaos could still find a way in.
