## Story Opening:

The humid Georgia air hung thick and heavy, clinging to Harrison Charles Blackwood like a damp shroud. Sweat beaded on his forehead, mirroring the beads of condensation clinging to his iced tea glass. He took a long, slow sip, the sweet, lemony tang offering a fleeting respite from the impending doom he felt gathering in the pit of his stomach.

Across the veranda, the dilapidated Southern Belle that was the 'Magnolia Bloom Theatre' sighed and creaked under the weight of the afternoon sun. Paint peeled from its fluted columns like sunburnt skin, revealing the grey bones of the building underneath. Harrison knew, with a sinking certainty, that he was witnessing the beginning of the end. Tonight was opening night of his ambitious, if somewhat ill-advised, adaptation of "Macbeth" set during the Civil War, and ticket sales were... abysmal.

He sighed, pushing the tea glass away. It clinked against the wrought iron table, the sound swallowed by the drone of cicadas in the surrounding oak trees. Harrison Charles Blackwood, theatrical director extraordinaire, had poured his heart, soul, and every last penny he possessed into this production. If it failed, and all signs pointed to a spectacular, Shakespearean-sized flop, he might as well pack his bags and head back to New York City, tail between his legs, to face the scornful "I told you so's" of his peers.

## Setting:

**The Magnolia Bloom Theatre, Harmony, Georgia.**

The theatre is a once-grand, two-story Victorian building that now shows its age. Its exterior is painted a faded pastel pink, and the large veranda that wraps around the front is furnished with mismatched wrought iron furniture, some of it showing signs of rust. The once meticulously manicured gardens are now overgrown, with weeds pushing their way through the cracks in the paving stones. Inside, the theatre boasts a charmingly outdated auditorium, complete with plush velvet seats (many stained and torn), a creaky wooden stage, and an ornate chandelier that perpetually threatens to plunge from the ceiling. The air inside is perpetually stale, carrying the scent of dust, old costumes, and a hint of mildew. The backstage area is a chaotic mess of props, half-finished set pieces, and overflowing costume racks. The dressing rooms are cramped and dimly lit, each echoing with the whispers of past performances and the anxieties of the present cast.
