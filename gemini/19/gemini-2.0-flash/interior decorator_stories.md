The scent of old money and beeswax hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Genevieve Eleanor Ashford. Sunlight, fractured by the leaded glass windows of the Archibald House, painted dappled patterns on the dust motes swirling in the otherwise still air. Genevieve adjusted her oversized tortoiseshell glasses and surveyed the entrance hall, her lips pressed into a thin, assessing line. Archibald House, a gothic monstrosity perched on a windswept cliff overlooking the Cornish coast, was less a home and more a monument to Victorian excess. Think gargoyles, dark oak panelling, and enough velvet to outfit a small country. And it was Genevieveâ€™s latest project.

She was here to breathe life back into it, to drag it kicking and screaming into the 21st century, without sacrificing its historical integrity. A near impossible task, given its current state. It smelled distinctly of decay, both of the building itself and of the family legacy it represented. The Archibalds, or what remained of them, wanted a "sympathetic restoration." Genevieve suspected they meant "cheap but impressive," a feat that would require all of her creativity, cunning, and a hefty dose of caffeine.
