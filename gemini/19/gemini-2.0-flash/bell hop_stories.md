Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a story featuring a bellhop named Archibald Finch:

**Setting:**

The Hotel Grand Imperiale, nestled on the bustling Rue de Rivoli in Paris, shimmered with an old-world grandeur that was both captivating and slightly suffocating.  Its marble floors, polished to a blinding gleam, reflected the crystal chandeliers that dripped like frozen waterfalls from the impossibly high ceilings.  The air, perfumed with the faint scent of lilies and generations of expensive cigar smoke, hummed with a low, constant thrum of privileged conversation – hushed pronouncements in French, clipped English, and the melodic drawl of wealthy Americans.  Behind the reception desk, impeccably dressed staff navigated the endless stream of arriving and departing guests with a practiced air of polite detachment, while just inside the revolving doors, history was in full swing.

**Opening:**

Archibald Finch, bellhop number seven at the Hotel Grand Imperiale, had seen it all.  Lost dogs in diamond collars, weeping heiresses with baggage the size of small cars, clandestine meetings that reeked of international intrigue.  But even Archibald, a man who considered himself immune to the surprises the Grand Imperiale regularly threw his way, paused, his eyes widening ever so slightly, as *she* stepped out of the sleek black limousine.  She was a vision in a scarlet coat, a flash of crimson against the greyscale backdrop of Parisian autumn. A vision with an aura of such unmistakable power that even the jaded doorman stood a little straighter. Archibald adjusted his cap, straightened his uniform, and swallowed the lump in his throat. This wasn’t just another guest. This, Archibald Finch suspected, was going to be trouble.
