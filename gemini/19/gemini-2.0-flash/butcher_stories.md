**Opening:**

The pungent aroma of blood and rosemary hung heavy in the air, clinging to the rough-hewn timbers of the shop like a persistent memory. A fly, fat and lazy from the summer heat, buzzed lazily against the windowpane, mirroring the slow, deliberate rhythm of Alistair Finch’s cleaver as it fell. Each chop was precise, a testament to years spent mastering the art of butchery, a silent conversation between man and meat. Outside, the market square bustled with life – hawkers shouting, children laughing, the clatter of carts – but inside Finch’s Fine Cuts, time seemed to slow, punctuated only by the rhythmic thud of blade against bone. Today, however, the comforting familiarity felt like a lead weight in Alistair's chest. Something was wrong. The usual ease with which he anticipated the meat's natural grain, the intuitive grace of his movements, was gone, replaced by a nagging unease that prickled his skin. He glanced at the half-carved haunch of venison on the block, its rich, dark color normally a source of satisfaction, now seeming almost…ominous.

**Setting:**

Finch’s Fine Cuts was a cornerstone of the town of Oakhaven, nestled deep in the heart of the Whisperwood. The shop itself was an ancient building, its stone walls thick and moss-covered, its sign – a hand-painted illustration of a jovial pig sporting a butcher’s apron – faded but still recognizable. Inside, the floor was covered in sawdust, meticulously swept each evening by Alistair to absorb the day's spills. Display cases, kept chilled by a complex system of pipes and ice blocks hauled down from the nearby Frostfell Mountains, showcased a variety of meats: plump chickens, glistening sausages, thick-cut steaks, and the occasional exotic offering, like boar or even, when Alistair could get his hands on it, the coveted Whisperwood stag. Woven into the shop's atmosphere were the accumulated smells of decades of butchery – a blend of savory spices, aged wood, and the ever-present tang of raw meat. Beyond the main counter was a small back room, Alistair’s domain. Here, he kept his tools – a collection of gleaming knives, cleavers, and saws, each meticulously sharpened and cared for – along with a smoker for curing meats and a small pantry for storing his secret spice blends. The Whisperwood itself was a constant presence, its ancient trees pressing close to Oakhaven, casting long shadows and lending the town a sense of both peace and profound, untamed wilderness. It was a place where the scent of pine needles mingled with the aroma of roasting meat, a place where the old ways still held sway.
