## Opening:

The screech of the alarm clawed through the remnants of Daniel "Danny" Hayes' sleep, instantly replacing the peaceful image of his daughter's beaming face with a brutal dose of reality. He was already halfway out of bed before the tinny voice crackled over the station’s PA system: "Structure fire, Elm Street. Multiple reports of trapped occupants. Engine 24 and Ladder 12 respond." His heart lurched. Elm Street. That was… close. Too close.

## Setting:

The scene was a chaotic ballet of flashing lights and frantic activity. It was a crisp autumn evening in the small, tightly-knit town of Havenwood, nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. The air, usually filled with the sweet scent of woodsmoke and pine, was now thick with the acrid stench of burning wood and plastic.

An old, two-story Victorian house, its once-elegant facade now marred by blackened scorch marks, vomited plumes of thick, grey smoke into the night sky. Orange flames licked hungrily at the windows, casting dancing shadows that twisted familiar shapes into grotesque figures. Neighbors huddled on the sidewalk, their faces illuminated by the fire's infernal glow, a mixture of fear and morbid fascination etched onto their features. The rumble of the fire was a constant, unnerving heartbeat, punctuated by the shrill wail of sirens and the shouts of firefighters battling the blaze.
