The rhythmic thump-thump-thump of tiny tennis shoes echoed in the cavernous hallway of Maplewood Elementary, a sound normally lost in the cacophony of boisterous children. Today, however, the halls were eerily silent, the desks and cubbies in Mrs. Petunia Plumtree's third-grade classroom still and lifeless, awaiting the return of their rightful owners in a weekâ€™s time. The last bell of the school year had rung just an hour ago, and most of the staff had already fled, eager to soak up the summer sun. But not Petunia.

Petunia Plumtree, her ginger hair pulled back in a practical, if somewhat severe, bun, was kneeling amidst a sea of brightly colored construction paper scraps, meticulously sorting them into overflowing bins. A faint scent of Elmer's glue and stale goldfish crackers hung in the air, a familiar perfume that Petunia, surprisingly, found comforting. Maplewood Elementary, a sprawling single-story building nestled in the heart of Willow Creek, Montana, was her sanctuary, her battlefield, her home away from home. The faded posters of multiplication tables and the hand-drawn artwork adorning the walls were more precious to her than any gallery masterpiece. It was a humble place, a place where dreams were nurtured, and where Petunia Plumtree felt, above all else, useful.
