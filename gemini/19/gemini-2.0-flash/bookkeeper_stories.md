The persistent hum of the fluorescent lights was a familiar comfort to Eleanor Beatrice Abernathy. As the late afternoon sun dipped below the horizon, casting long, skeletal shadows of the filing cabinets across the floor of Abernathy & Sons Lumber, Eleanor felt a peculiar sense of contentment. She wasn't sure what it was, perhaps the orderliness of her meticulously organized ledger, or the rhythmic click-clack of the adding machine keys, but she found a strange solace in the predictable world of debits and credits.

Abernathy & Sons Lumber, nestled just off Route 16 in the sleepy town of Havenwood, Maine, wasn't much to look at. A sprawling, weathered warehouse dominated the landscape, surrounded by piles of lumber stacked haphazardly like a giant's forgotten building blocks. The air, thick with the scent of pine and sawdust, hung heavy and still. Inside the small, cramped office, however, Eleanor reigned supreme. Her domain was a small, cluttered space partitioned off from the main warehouse by a flimsy particleboard wall. Sunlight, when it deigned to grace Havenwood, filtered weakly through a grimy window, illuminating the stacks of invoices, the overflowing in-tray, and the ever-present coffee stains on her worn desk. This was her kingdom, and she ruled it with a sharp pencil and an even sharper mind. And today, Eleanor Beatrice Abernathy, bookkeeper extraordinaire, felt a distinct unease prickling at the back of her neck. Something wasâ€¦ off.
