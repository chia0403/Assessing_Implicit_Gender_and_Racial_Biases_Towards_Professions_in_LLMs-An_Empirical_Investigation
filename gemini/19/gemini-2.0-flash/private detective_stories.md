## Story Opening & Setting:

**Opening:**

The rain was doing its best impression of a broken faucet, hammering against the grimy windowpane. Thomas Ashton Blackwood, a name that screamed 'literary protagonist' but housed a man who primarily screamed at unpaid bills, sighed and swiveled in his creaky chair. The half-empty bottle of rye on his desk winked back at him in the dim light, a tempting but ultimately self-defeating proposition. The aroma of stale cigarette smoke clung to the air like a stubborn ghost, a testament to the endless hours spent chasing shadows and dead-end leads. He needed a case. Desperately. And then, as if summoned by the sheer force of his need, the buzzer buzzed.

**Setting:**

Thomas Ashton Blackwood's office occupied a cramped corner on the third floor of the Oakhaven Building, a pre-war monstrosity looming over the perpetually damp streets of Port Blossom, Oregon. Port Blossom was a town clinging to the coastline, a place where the scent of salt mingled with the exhaust fumes of logging trucks, and the relentless fog seemed to seep into the very bones of its residents. The Oakhaven Building, much like the town itself, was past its prime. Peeling paint revealed layers of forgotten history, and the elevator wheezed and groaned with every ascent, sounding like a geriatric whale in its death throes.

Inside Blackwood's office, things weren't much better. The single room was a chaotic symphony of overflowing ashtrays, stacks of dog-eared files, and half-eaten sandwiches fossilized on forgotten plates. A tattered fedora sat perched precariously on a wobbly lamp stand, casting long, skeletal shadows across the room. A framed, faded photo of a smiling woman leaned against a chipped teacup on the desk - a silent reminder of a life left behind, a life that fueled the simmering cynicism in Thomas Ashton Blackwood's hardened heart. The only item that seemed genuinely cared for was a well-worn copy of "The Maltese Falcon" lying open on his lap, as if hoping to glean some inspiration from its pages.
