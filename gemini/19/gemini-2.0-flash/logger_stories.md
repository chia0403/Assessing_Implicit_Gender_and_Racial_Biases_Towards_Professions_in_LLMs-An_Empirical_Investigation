## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The biting air hung thick and heavy with the scent of pine and damp earth. It was late November in the heart of the Olympic National Forest, a place where the ancient trees clawed at the perpetually overcast sky. Towering spruces and hemlocks, their trunks thick enough to swallow a small car, stood shoulder to shoulder, their branches laced together like skeletal fingers. Beneath the canopy, the world was a tapestry of muted greens and browns, punctuated by the occasional burst of crimson from a hardy salal bush clinging to a fallen log. A light rain, barely more than a persistent mist, slicked the ground, making every step treacherous.

**Opening:**

The whine of the chainsaw ripped through the forest's quiet slumber, a brutal, metallic scream that echoed against the ancient trees. Elijah Thomas Carter, his breath puffing out in white clouds, wrestled the roaring machine against the base of a colossal Douglas fir. His muscles burned, sweat stinging his eyes despite the cold, but he held firm. This was no ordinary tree; this was a monster, a titan that had stood watch over the forest for centuries. Elijah knew its fall would send tremors through the earth, not just physically, but somehow…spiritually. He hesitated, his finger hovering over the throttle. He’d logged these woods his whole life, learned to read the rings of the trees like scriptures, but today, a knot of unease sat heavy in his gut. The forest felt different, somehow watchful. He swallowed hard, pushed down the feeling, and squeezed the trigger. The chainsaw screamed again, and Elijah Carter, a man weathered by sun and rain, a man who knew the language of wood and steel, began to tear down a piece of history.
