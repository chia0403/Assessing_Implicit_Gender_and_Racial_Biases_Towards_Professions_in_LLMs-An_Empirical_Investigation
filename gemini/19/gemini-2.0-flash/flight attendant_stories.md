The stale, recirculated air of the Boeing 777 clung to everything, even Amelia Rose Bellweather's smile. Outside, the inky blackness swallowed the plane whole, punctuated only by the blinking crimson lights on the wingtips. Amelia adjusted her perfectly knotted silk scarf, a practiced flick of the wrist that barely registered in her consciousness. She was on flight KL643, Amsterdam to Chicago, and had already dispensed enough lukewarm coffee and miniature pretzels to feed a small army.

Her setting was the galley of the business class cabin, a cramped but familiar space buzzing with the low hum of the plane's engines and the clatter of ice in plastic cups. Soft, ambient music piped through the overhead speakers, doing its best to soothe the jet-lagged and slightly disgruntled passengers settling in for their eight-hour transatlantic flight. The scent of airplane food – a vaguely chicken-like aroma struggling against the more robust scent of duty-free perfume – hung heavy in the air. Amelia, however, barely noticed it anymore. After ten years of flying, she’d become immune to the unique olfactory cocktail that was the inside of a commercial airliner.
