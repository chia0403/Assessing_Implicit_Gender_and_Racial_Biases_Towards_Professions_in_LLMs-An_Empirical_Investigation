The rusty pipe groaned like a dying walrus as condensation dripped onto Bartholomew "Bart" Higginsâ€™ forehead. He wiped it away with the back of his hand, leaving a streak of grime that only accentuated his already harried expression. Bart, a plumber of some renown (mostly among the residents of the dilapidated Willow Creek Apartments), hated Mondays. But this Monday, at 7:13 AM, was particularly brutal. He was knee-deep in a flooded laundry room, surrounded by the stench of mildew and the frantic, sputtering whir of the building's ancient sump pump, which sounded like it was about to give up the ghost.

Willow Creek Apartments was a three-story brick building on the wrong side of town. Built sometime in the 1930s, it had seen better days. The paint peeled in long strips, revealing layers of faded hues beneath. The lobby, once grand with its mosaic floor and ornate plasterwork, now reeked of stale cigarette smoke and despair. The residents were a motley crew of struggling artists, retirees on fixed incomes, and young families just starting out, all bound together by the shared experience of leaky roofs, unreliable heating, and the ever-present threat of a vermin infestation. It was a far cry from the glossy brochures Bart saw in his mailbox, filled with images of luxury condos and infinity pools. But it was his territory, his bread and butter, and where he, Bartholomew Higgins, plumber extraordinaire (or at least competent), made his living.
