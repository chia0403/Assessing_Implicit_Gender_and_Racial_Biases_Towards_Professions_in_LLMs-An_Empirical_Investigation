Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a story with a phlebotomist as the main character:

**Opening:**

The sterile scent of antiseptic clung to the air, a familiar comfort to Amelia Beatrice Dubois. At 6:00 AM, the fluorescent lights of the St. Jude's Community Clinic buzzed with a relentless energy that belied the sleepy dawn struggling to break through the grime-streaked windows. Amelia, her braided auburn hair tucked neatly under her scrub cap, adjusted the tension on her tourniquet, the quiet *snap* a counterpoint to the nervous chatter of Mrs. Henderson waiting patiently in chair number three.  "Just a pinch, dear," Amelia murmured, her voice a soothing balm to the woman's anxiety. "Deep breaths. You've done this a hundred times."  But even as she spoke, Amelia’s own pulse quickened. It wasn't Mrs. Henderson's routine blood draw making her uneasy. It was the odd, almost tangible tension humming through the clinic – a feeling she couldn't quite place, like a forgotten medical mystery simmering just below the surface of the everyday.

**Setting:**

**St. Jude's Community Clinic, Belleville, Illinois:**

St. Jude's is a small, perpetually underfunded clinic nestled in the heart of Belleville, a blue-collar town struggling to revitalize its Rust Belt roots. The building itself is a converted two-story brick house, its once-grand Victorian details faded by time and neglect. Inside, the walls are painted a pale, institutional green, chipped and scarred in places.  The waiting room is cramped, furnished with mismatched plastic chairs and dog-eared magazines. The air always smells faintly of bleach, stale coffee, and the underlying scent of illness.

Amelia’s workstation, a small counter tucked between the lab and a storage closet, is her domain. It is meticulously organized with rows of vacutainers, needles, sharps containers, and stacks of requisition forms. A small, framed picture of her grandmother, Beatrice, a former nurse herself, sits on the corner of the counter, a constant reminder of Amelia’s dedication to her craft.  The clinic, despite its limitations, is a vital lifeline for the community, offering affordable healthcare to those who need it most. It’s a place of weary faces, quiet suffering, and, sometimes, unexpected moments of resilience and human connection.
