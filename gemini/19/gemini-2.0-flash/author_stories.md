## Story Opening:

The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Beatrice Finch's hands as she stared out the rain-streaked window. Another grey day in Port Blossom. Another deadline looming. And another blank page mocking her. 

Her last novel, a frothy romance about a bookstore owner and a brooding lighthouse keeper, had been a surprise hit. Now, everyone – her agent, her publisher, even the over-enthusiastic fans who left shell-shaped trinkets on her doorstep – was clamoring for a sequel. But Amelia was stuck. Hopelessly, frustratingly stuck. The lighthouse keeper had married the bookstore owner. What more was there to say?

She took a large gulp of the lukewarm Earl Grey, the bitter taste doing little to dispel the creative fog that clung to her brain. Outside, the relentless drumming of the rain echoed the incessant tap-tap-tap of her own anxiety. She needed inspiration. She needed a new idea. She needed, perhaps, to burn the manuscript she'd tentatively titled "Beacon of Love: The Honeymoon Years" and start again.

## Setting:

**Port Blossom, Maine:** A small, picturesque coastal town clinging to the craggy coastline. Tourism is its lifeblood, evident in the overflowing seafood restaurants, the brightly painted souvenir shops selling lobster-shaped everything, and the quaint, though often drafty, Victorian houses that line the main street. The air is thick with the smell of salt and brine, and the cry of gulls is a constant soundtrack.

Amelia lives in a cozy, two-story cottage overlooking the harbor. The house, affectionately dubbed "Inkwell Cottage," is a chaotic haven filled with overflowing bookshelves, stacks of manuscripts, and a rotating collection of half-finished art projects. The walls are painted a cheerful, albeit slightly faded, seafoam green, and the furniture is a mismatched collection of antiques and thrift store finds, all testament to Amelia's eclectic taste and perpetual state of creative disarray.
