The late afternoon sun, a molten orange orb sinking below the horizon, turned the dusty shingles of the Victorian house into a shimmering expanse of copper. Johnathan Michael Bellwether, sweat beading on his brow and the grit of twenty years of roofing etched into the lines around his eyes, paused to wipe his forehead with a rag. He straightened, the familiar ache in his lower back reminding him he wasn't getting any younger, and surveyed his progress. Two-thirds done. Just another day clinging to the precarious slopes of Havenwood.

Havenwood wasn't a town, not really. More a cluster of sprawling, meticulously manicured estates clinging to the edge of the Redwood National Park. Wealth oozed from every perfectly painted clapboard and expertly arranged flower bed. It was a place where the only thing louder than the rustling of the redwoods was the hushed gossip of the residents, and Johnathan, with his calloused hands and perpetually dirt-stained work boots, knew he was forever on the outside looking in. He didnâ€™t mind, not really. He preferred the company of the ancient trees to the meticulously curated smiles of the Havenwood gentry. Besides, their leaking roofs kept him in business, and business was good.
