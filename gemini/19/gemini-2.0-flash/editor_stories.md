**Opening:**

Eleanor "Ellie" Vance slammed the well-worn hardback of "A History of Botanical Illustration" shut, the thud echoing in the otherwise silent office. Not because she was angry, though she was perpetually teetering on the edge of frustrated these days. No, it was simply a punctuation mark to her day of relentless commas, misplaced modifiers, and authors who seemed to believe the Oxford comma was a personal affront. The weight of the book, a comforting presence on her desk for the past five years, was a reminder that beautiful things, crafted with precision and care, still existed. Just rarely in the slush pile that landed on her desk each morning.

**Setting:**

Ellie’s office was tucked away in the sprawling, slightly dilapidated offices of Penumbra Publishing, a small but fiercely independent house specializing in niche genres. Think occult romance, steampunk erotica, and historical biographies written by academics who’d seemingly never spoken to a real person. Located in a converted warehouse in the slightly-less-than-gentrified district of Boston's South End, the building was a warren of creaky floorboards, mismatched furniture sourced from various thrift stores, and the persistent aroma of stale coffee and paper dust. Ellie's own corner was a testament to her organized chaos. Bookshelves overflowed with everything from first editions of Agatha Christie to dog-eared copies of Greek tragedies. Stacks of manuscripts teetered precariously on every available surface, threatening to topple at the slightest provocation. A framed print of Aubrey Beardsley's "The Peacock Skirt" hung crookedly above her desk, a silent, sardonic observer to her daily struggles. The only real hint of personality, beyond the sheer volume of books, was a small, vibrant orchid blooming precariously in a chipped ceramic pot – a gift from her eccentric Aunt Mildred, who insisted that every editor needed a little "living punctuation."
