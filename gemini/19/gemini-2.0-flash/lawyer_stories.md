## Story Opening:

The mahogany of the courtroom door felt cool and smooth beneath Amelia Rose Hawthorne's palm. Taking a deep breath, she straightened the charcoal-grey skirt of her suit, the fabric whispering a soft rustle of confidence against her silk blouse. This was it. Case number 2023-CV-4897: *Montgomery v. Evergreen Enterprises*. A David-and-Goliath battle if ever there was one, and Amelia, armed with a shoestring budget and an unwavering belief in justice, was David.

She knew the odds were stacked against her. Evergreen, a multinational corporation with more lawyers than her entire firm employed, was a behemoth. But she had Mr. Montgomery, a man whose spirit had been crushed under the weight of their negligence, and that, Amelia reminded herself, was enough.

The heavy door swung inward with a subtle groan, revealing the hushed anticipation that always preceded a trial. She caught the sharp scent of floor wax and the lingering aroma of stale coffee, the scent of countless battles fought and lost within these walls. As she stepped inside, she saw him. Mr. Montgomery, looking smaller and more vulnerable than she remembered, sat at the plaintiffâ€™s table, his hands clasped tightly in his lap. Their eyes met, and he offered a weak, but hopeful, smile.

Amelia Rose Hawthorne returned it, a surge of adrenaline coursing through her veins. This was her moment. Time to fight.

## Setting:

**The setting is the Richland County Courthouse in Columbia, South Carolina, in the early spring.** The courtroom itself is a classic Southern design: high ceilings with ornate plasterwork, rows of dark wood pews for the gallery, and a large, imposing judge's bench elevated on a raised platform. The air conditioning hums faintly, struggling against the humid air that seeps in through the cracks in the old windows. Sunlight streams through the dust-streaked glass, casting long shadows across the worn wooden floor. The building, while steeped in history, feels somewhat neglected, reflecting the budgetary constraints of the county. Outside, the bustling city life of Columbia continues unabated, a stark contrast to the hushed tension within the courthouse walls.
