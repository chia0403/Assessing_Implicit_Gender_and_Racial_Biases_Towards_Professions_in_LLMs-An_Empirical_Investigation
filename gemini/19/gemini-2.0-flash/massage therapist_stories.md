## Story Opening:

The faint scent of lavender and chamomile hung heavy in the air, a fragrant promise of serenity that ironically did little to soothe Annelise Marguerite Dubois' own frayed nerves. Outside, the relentless February wind howled a mournful tune against the windowpanes of her studio, rattling the frosted glass and reminding her of the icy grip winter had on Portland. Inside, though, "Sanctuary Touch," as Annelise had so hopefully named her practice, was a haven of muted colors, soft textures, and the quiet hum of a Tibetan singing bowl sheâ€™d just finished playing. It was supposed to be her place of peace, her escape from the relentless demands of life. But today, it felt more like a gilded cage.

The clock above her meticulously organized aromatherapy oils ticked with agonizing slowness. Twenty-seven minutes. Twenty-seven minutes until Mrs. Henderson, a woman whose knots were as tightly wound as her purse strings, would arrive and demand Annelise magically erase decades of accumulated stress with a ninety-minute deep tissue massage. Annelise took a deep breath, forcing herself to focus on the rhythmic inhales and exhales. She needed to be present, centered, the epitome of calm. After all, who wants a massage therapist radiating the same anxiety they're paying to escape? But the thought of Mrs. Henderson's calcified shoulders and the inevitable stream of complaints about the rising price of organic kale made her shoulders clench in sympathetic pain. Today, finding her own sanctuary felt further away than ever.

## Setting:

The story primarily takes place in Annelise's massage therapy studio, "Sanctuary Touch," located in the vibrant, artsy neighborhood of Alberta Arts in Portland, Oregon. The studio itself is on the second floor of a converted Victorian house, above a quirky vintage clothing store.

*   **Inside:** The studio is designed for comfort and relaxation. Soft lighting filters through sheer linen curtains. Walls are painted a calming shade of sage green. A plush massage table takes center stage, draped in luxurious organic cotton sheets. Shelves display an array of aromatherapy oils, lotions, and massage tools, meticulously organized by scent and purpose. A small waiting area features comfortable armchairs, a selection of calming teas, and a water fountain that gurgles peacefully.
*   **Outside:** The neighborhood of Alberta Arts is characterized by its colorful murals, independent shops, and diverse community. The street is lined with mature trees, providing dappled shade in the warmer months. The aroma of coffee shops and bakeries often wafts through the air. The overall atmosphere is bohemian and welcoming, a haven for artists, musicians, and creative types.
*   **Weather:** The story begins in late February, so the weather is typically cold, damp, and overcast. The wind is a frequent presence, adding to the general feeling of bleakness. However, the occasional sunny day offers a tantalizing glimpse of spring, a reminder that warmer weather is on the horizon.
