## Story Opening:

The air in the Dimock & Sons Drafting Office hung thick with the smell of paper dust, cheap coffee, and the quiet hum of fluorescent lights. Dust motes, disturbed by the rotating ceiling fan, danced in the single beam of sunlight that managed to penetrate the grimy window overlooking Brick Lane. Eleanor "Ellie" Montgomery chewed the end of her pencil, her brow furrowed in concentration. She was stuck.

Ellie had been staring at the same blueprint for the last hour, the intricate network of pipes and valves swimming before her weary eyes. The new ventilation system for the abandoned St. Jude's Asylum was proving to be a beast, a maddening labyrinth of angles and specifications that seemed to shift and rearrange themselves every time she blinked.

A sigh escaped her lips. She wasn't just frustrated with the ventilation system; she was frustrated with her entire life. Three years out of drafting school, and she was still stuck correcting Mr. Henderson's questionable pipe routing, dreaming of designing something, *anything*, of her own. She glanced at the half-empty teacup on her desk, the brown liquid lukewarm and uninviting. Maybe a break was in order. Maybe a distraction. Maybe, just maybe, she could finally find the missing link in this damn blueprint before she lost her mind entirely.

## Setting:

**Dimock & Sons Drafting Office, 1932, London, England:**

The office is a cramped, single-room affair located on the third floor of a decaying building on Brick Lane, in the East End of London. The furniture is worn and mismatched, comprised of sturdy wooden desks scarred with years of use, rickety chairs upholstered in faded green fabric, and tall, overflowing filing cabinets. Maps of London and blueprints of various projects are pinned haphazardly to the peeling wallpaper.

The atmosphere is generally quiet, punctuated by the scratching of pencils, the rustling of paper, and the occasional gruff cough from Mr. Henderson, the senior draftsman. Natural light is scarce, supplemented by harsh fluorescent bulbs that cast long, unflattering shadows. The overall impression is one of functional utility, a space dedicated to meticulous work rather than comfort or aesthetics.
