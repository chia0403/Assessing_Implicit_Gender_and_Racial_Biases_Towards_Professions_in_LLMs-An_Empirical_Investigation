The sterile scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, a constant, low-grade reminder of the battle fought and, hopefully, won. Rain lashed against the large picture window overlooking the rehabilitation garden, blurring the already fading colors of autumn into an impressionistic wash. Eleanor Patricia Ainsworth sighed, adjusting the gait belt around Mr. Henderson, a sprightly eighty-year-old who was determined to walk his dog again, even if it meant conquering a recently replaced hip.

"One more step, Mr. Henderson. That's it. Nice and slow." Eleanor's voice was calm, a carefully modulated mix of encouragement and authority. She knew how to coax a little further, how to push without pushing too hard. It was a skill honed over years spent patching people back together, piece by piece, both physically and emotionally.

The center specialized in post-surgical recovery and neurological rehabilitation, a place where stroke survivors relearned to speak, accident victims learned to move again, and amputees grappled with the complexities of a new life. St. Jude's was a place of both profound heartbreak and triumphant resilience, and Eleanor, with her quiet strength and unwavering empathy, felt strangely at home amidst the struggle.
