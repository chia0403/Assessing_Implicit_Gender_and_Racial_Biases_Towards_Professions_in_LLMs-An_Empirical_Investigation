The relentless August sun beat down on the back of Jedediah Elijah Blackwood, turning the faded denim of his overalls into a damp, itchy second skin. Dust devils danced like mischievous spirits across the parched earth of his cornfield, each tiny tornado a mocking reminder of the meager harvest to come. The air shimmered with heat, thick and heavy, smelling of dry straw and the faint, metallic tang of distant wildfires.

He was working his way down the endless rows of corn, his calloused hands running along the stalks, feeling for the promising heft of a developing ear, but finding mostly disappointment. Most were stunted, withered, a testament to the prolonged drought that had gripped Harmony Creek, Missouri, for the past six weeks.

The setting was Blackwood Acres, a hundred-acre spread carved out of the rolling hills of the Ozarks generations ago. The land, once fertile and bountiful, was now cracked and thirsty. In the distance, Jedediah could just make out the silhouette of his farmhouse, a sturdy but weathered two-story structure painted a peeling white. The barn, a behemoth of aged timber and rusting metal, stood sentinel nearby. Surrounding it all was the unforgiving landscape, the dry, yellowing fields stretching towards the horizon, punctuated by the occasional stand of scraggly oak trees, their leaves already tinged with the brown of premature autumn. Blackwood Acres was a testament to the Blackwood family's resilience, but right now, even Jedediah, a man built of grit and determination, felt the weight of the land bearing down on him.
