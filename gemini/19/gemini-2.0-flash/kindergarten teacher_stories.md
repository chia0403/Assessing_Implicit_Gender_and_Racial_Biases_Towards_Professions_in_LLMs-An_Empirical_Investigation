The aroma of stale coffee and finger paint hung heavy in the air of Room 12, a sensory experience Miss Eleanor Beatrice Plumtree had grown both accustomed to and oddly fond of. Outside, the November wind howled a mournful tune against the frosted windows of Meadowbrook Elementary, blurring the skeletal branches of the ancient oak that stood sentinel over the playground. Inside, however, the air buzzed with the barely contained energy of twenty-two five-year-olds, each a tiny, self-proclaimed expert on dinosaurs, unicorns, or, in young Timmy’s case, the correct way to eat boogers (a topic Eleanor tried, and usually failed, to steer clear of).

It was Monday, which meant it was “Show and Tell” day, a ritual that filled Eleanor with a mix of anticipation and dread. Anticipation because it offered a glimpse into the wonderfully bizarre worlds these children inhabited, and dread because it usually involved some form of glitter-induced chaos or a particularly pungent pet being sprung from its carrier. Eleanor took a deep breath, smoothing the slightly rumpled collar of her cardigan, and pasted on her brightest, most encouraging smile. "Good morning, my little sunflowers!" she announced, her voice barely audible over the rising tide of childish chatter. "Are we ready for Show and Tell?"
