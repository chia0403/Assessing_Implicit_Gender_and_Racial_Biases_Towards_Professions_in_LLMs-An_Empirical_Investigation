Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a guidance counselor as the main character:

**Story Opening:**

The fluorescent lights of Northwood High hummed a dull, monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the impending doom that hung in the air like stagnant gym socks. Beatrice Amelia Harding, Guidance Counselor extraordinaire and champion of the underdog, surveyed her office with a weary sigh. It was Thursday, the day before semester grades were due, and her waiting room was overflowing with the usual suspects: panicked freshmen who'd suddenly realized procrastination wasn't a viable lifestyle choice, tearful seniors facing the crushing weight of college rejection, and a sprinkling of parents whose anxiety was more contagious than the flu during winter break. Beatrice, however, was dreading one particular visitor: Mrs. Eleanor Abernathy, mother of precocious but profoundly troubled sophomore, Felix Abernathy.

**Setting:**

The story primarily takes place at Northwood High, a sprawling, somewhat dilapidated public high school nestled in the quiet, tree-lined suburb of Oakhaven. The school is known for its diverse student body, its mediocre sports teams, and a faint, lingering odor of cafeteria pizza that permeates the hallways.

Beatrice Harding's office, Room 212, is a small, cluttered space. Walls are plastered with motivational posters ("Reach for the Stars!" "Believe in Yourself!") and college pennants collected over years of successful placements. A well-worn armchair sits opposite her desk, worn down by countless tearful confessions and awkward college application strategies.  Her desk itself is a controlled chaos of files, appointment calendars, and an impressive collection of stress balls. A small, perpetually dusty plant named Phil hangs precariously from the windowsill, a silent testament to Beatrice's good intentions but inconsistent nurturing.

**Additional Notes for Setting:**

*   **Oakhaven:** A typical American suburb, seemingly idyllic on the surface, but with its own undercurrents of social pressure and parental expectations.
*   **Northwood High's Atmosphere:** A mix of apathy and ambition, reflecting the diverse backgrounds and aspirations of its students.
*   **Visual Cues:** Faded paint, lockers that clang and squeak, the rhythmic thud of basketballs in the gym, the scent of floor wax mixing with adolescent angst.
