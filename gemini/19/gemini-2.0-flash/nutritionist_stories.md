Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a nutritionist named Dr. Vivian Holloway:

**Setting:** A bustling farmers market in the heart of Silverlake, Los Angeles, on a Sunday morning in late spring. The air is thick with the scent of ripe strawberries, freshly baked bread, and blooming jasmine. Sunlight dapples through the leaves of the towering sycamore trees that line the perimeter, casting dancing shadows on the colorful array of produce, artisanal cheeses, and handcrafted goods. Reggae music pulses softly from a nearby stall, adding to the vibrant, almost chaotic, energy.

**Opening:**

Dr. Vivian Holloway hated Sundays. Or, more accurately, she hated *this* particular Sunday. The one where she was supposed to be "off duty," relaxing, and perhaps even indulging in a mimosa or two. Instead, here she was, wedged between a stall overflowing with heirloom tomatoes and a woman attempting to navigate the throngs with a stroller the size of a small car, desperately trying to avoid eye contact with anyone who might recognize her. Because, let's face it, in a place like the Silverlake Farmers Market, dodging potential clients was a near-impossible feat for a nutritionist like Vivian. She pulled her oversized sunglasses further down her nose and gripped the handle of her reusable tote bag a little tighter. She just wanted to find the perfect Meyer lemons for her grandmother's lemon bars, and get out before someone started quizzing her about the glycemic index of Medjool dates or, heaven forbid, trying to sell her on another cleanse. A deep sigh escaped her lips, mingling with the aroma of lavender honey. Sunday morning, a supposed sanctuary, had turned into a minefield of unsolicited dietary advice and desperate pleas for weight-loss miracles.
