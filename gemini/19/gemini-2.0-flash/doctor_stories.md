## Story Opening:

The rain hammered against the leaded glass windows of the clinic, each drop a frantic plea for shelter. Inside, Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth stared at the blurry cityscape beyond, the familiar ache in her shoulders mirroring the ache in her heart. Another day ending, another string of ailments and anxieties paraded before her. Another day where she felt like she was merely patching holes in a dam about to burst.

Tonight, however, felt different. A persistent buzz, a nervous tremor in the air, suggested something beyond the usual urban unease. Eleanor rubbed her temples, the faint scent of antiseptic and exhaustion clinging to her fingers. She’d seen enough this year to know when the city was holding its breath, waiting for something… or someone… to break.

## Setting:

Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth's clinic, "Ainsworth Medical," was nestled on the third floor of a pre-war building in the heart of the historic and slightly crumbling district of Oldhaven, in the city of Aethelburg. The building, once a grand manor house, had been divided into smaller offices and apartments decades ago.

Ainsworth Medical, despite its modest size, was a haven of faded elegance. High ceilings, chipped crown molding, and a Persian rug that had seen better centuries, hinted at the building's former glory. Eleanor had painstakingly furnished the space with comfortable armchairs and antique lamps, trying to create an atmosphere of warmth and reassurance, a stark contrast to the cold, clinical atmosphere of larger, more modern practices.

The waiting room was small, usually filled with a motley collection of Oldhaven residents: elderly widows with arthritic knees, struggling artists with persistent coughs, and weary factory workers with lingering injuries. Bookshelves overflowed with tattered paperbacks and dog-eared medical journals, a testament to Eleanor's love of learning and a subtle deterrent to excessive gossip.

Beyond the waiting room lay Eleanor's consultation room, a sanctuary of organized chaos. Files overflowed from overflowing shelves, a microscope sat perched precariously on the edge of her desk, and framed medical diagrams adorned the walls, a constant reminder of the intricate beauty and fragile nature of the human body. The scent of chamomile tea and disinfectant hung heavy in the air, a comforting, if somewhat contradictory, olfactory blend.
