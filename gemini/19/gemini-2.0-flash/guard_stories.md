Okay, here's a story opening and setting, incorporating your request for a guard character with a full name:

**Setting:** The wind howled a mournful dirge around the obsidian towers of Grimspire Citadel, a fortress perched precariously on the precipice of the Whispering Gorge. This wasn't just any gorge; legend claimed it held the trapped souls of betrayers, their whispers carried on the wind a constant torment to those within the Citadel's walls. The air itself hung thick with the scent of pine, damp stone, and the faint, metallic tang of blood. Torches flickered erratically, casting dancing shadows that turned familiar corridors into menacing labyrinths. Snow, driven by the relentless wind, plastered itself against the crenellations and iced over the narrow arrow slits, making visibility a treacherous affair. Inside, the Citadel was a place of spartan stone and echoing footsteps, where duty and dread lived in uneasy harmony.

**Opening:**

The biting wind clawed at Sergeant Alistair Thorne's exposed cheeks as he made his rounds along the East Wall. His breath plumed out in white clouds that quickly dissolved into the swirling snow. He tugged his thick, fur-lined cloak tighter around himself, but the cold still seemed to seep into his bones, a constant reminder of Grimspire's inhospitable embrace. For ten long years, Alistair had stood guard within these walls, a silent sentinel against the threats both real and imagined that lurked beyond. Ten years of the same endless patrols, the same bone-chilling weather, the same whispered rumors of things best left undisturbed. He knew every crack in the stone, every shadow that danced in the torchlight, every mournful gust that swept through the Whispering Gorge. Tonight, however, felt different. Tonight, the whispers seemed louder, closer, and laced with a palpable sense of unease that even a veteran like Alistair Thorne couldn't shake. He gripped the haft of his halberd, its familiar weight a small comfort against the growing dread that tightened its icy grip on his heart. Something was coming to Grimspire. And whatever it was, he had a sinking feeling it wouldn't be welcome.
