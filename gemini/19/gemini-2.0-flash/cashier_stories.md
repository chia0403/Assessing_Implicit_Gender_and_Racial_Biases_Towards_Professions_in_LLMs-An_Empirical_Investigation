The fluorescent lights of "Marty's Mega Market" hummed a relentless, irritating tune, a soundtrack to Agnes Periwinkle's Tuesday afternoon. Agnes, her name tag proclaiming her rank and authority ("Hello! I'm Agnes!"), meticulously scanned a can of discounted lima beans, her lips moving almost imperceptibly as she recited the price in her head: 79 cents, less the 20% off, divided byâ€¦ forget it, just scan it.

Marty's Mega Market was a beige and blue behemoth that squatted on the edge of Oakhaven, a town known for its annual pumpkin festival and the pervasive aroma of fertilizer. It was, as Agnes often lamented, the epicenter of the mundane. Each aisle was a predictable symphony of overstocked shelves and crying children. Every customer, from the perpetually grumpy Mr. Henderson who insisted on paying with pennies to the overly enthusiastic Mrs. Gable who always brought homemade cookies (albeit suspiciously dry ones), was a character in a long, predictable play.

The sun beat down outside, turning the asphalt parking lot into a shimmering mirage, but inside Marty's, time seemed to operate differently. The air conditioning was always set to "Siberian," and the only connection to the outside world was the occasional glimpse through the grimy front windows. Agnes, trapped behind register number four, felt as though she was slowly being fossilized in a tomb of canned goods and discounted diapers. And today, a particularly sticky feeling of dread clung to the air, thicker than the scent of disinfectant and stale pastries emanating from the bakery. Something was definitely off, and Agnes, with her uncanny ability to predict impending coupon-related chaos, knew it in her bones.
