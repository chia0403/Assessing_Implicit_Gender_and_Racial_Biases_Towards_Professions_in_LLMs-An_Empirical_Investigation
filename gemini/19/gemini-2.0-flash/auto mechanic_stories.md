## Story Opening:

The humid Georgia air hung thick and heavy, clinging to the oily concrete of the garage floor and making the metal tools feel slick in Eudora Mae Billings' hands.  Outside, the cicadas buzzed a deafening chorus, a soundtrack to another sweltering summer day in Harmony Creek. Inside, however, the only sound was the rhythmic clang of her wrench against a stubborn bolt, a counterpoint to the gentle hiss of the air compressor in the corner. Eudora Mae leaned further into the engine bay of a beat-up Ford F-150, her brow furrowed in concentration.  Sweat trickled down her temples, leaving streaks in the grease smudged across her forehead.  Sheâ€™d been chasing this phantom misfire for three days now, and the damn thing was starting to feel personal.

## Setting:

The story takes place in Harmony Creek, a small, forgotten town in rural Georgia. Eudora Mae's auto repair shop, "Eudora Mae's Garage," is located on the outskirts of town, a ramshackle building constructed of corrugated metal and weathered wood. The interior is a chaotic but organized mess of tools, spare parts, and half-finished projects.  A calendar featuring vintage cars hangs precariously on the wall, its pages turned to the current month, July.  The air always smells of gasoline, motor oil, and a faint hint of Eudora Mae's preferred brand of strong coffee.  Outside, a dusty gravel lot serves as the parking area for vehicles awaiting repair, a graveyard of forgotten dreams on four wheels.  Beyond the lot, fields of sun-baked corn stretch as far as the eye can see, punctuated by the occasional dilapidated farmhouse and the shimmering heat haze rising from the asphalt highway. Harmony Creek itself is a town struggling to stay alive, its once bustling Main Street now lined with boarded-up storefronts and faded memories of a more prosperous past.
