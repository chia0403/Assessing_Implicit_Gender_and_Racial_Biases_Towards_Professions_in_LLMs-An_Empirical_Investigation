Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a probation officer:

**Opening:**

The chipped Formica tabletop beneath Beatrice Anya Petrova's coffee cup felt gritty, a microcosm of her day. Rain lashed against the reinforced windows of the Northern County Probation Office, mirroring the relentless dread that had settled in her gut since she'd seen the updated risk assessment on Curtis Bell. Level Three, High Risk, Violent Offender. Again. Just when she thought he was turning a corner, getting involved in the anger management workshops, even holding down a (admittedly precarious) job at the local car wash. Now this. Another assault charge, albeit a minor one.

Beatrice sighed, the sound barely audible above the rhythmic drumming of the rain and the clatter of keyboards from her colleagues. Outside, the premature twilight of a November afternoon pressed in on the office, a tangible weight. She took a long, lukewarm sip of her coffee, the bitter taste doing little to dispel the creeping unease. This wasn't just another case file. This was Curtis, a kid who reminded her, in all the wrong ways, of her own troubled brother. And the responsibility of ensuring he didn't completely derail his life, or worse, hurt someone else, lay squarely on her shoulders.

**Setting:**

The Northern County Probation Office is located in a low-slung, brick building that screams "municipal austerity." Nestled on the fringes of the small, industrial city of Braeburn, Pennsylvania, it sits across from a perpetually grey car dealership and next to a discount tire shop, lending the entire area an air of resigned practicality.

Inside, the office is a warren of cramped cubicles and windowless meeting rooms, perpetually lit by harsh fluorescent lights that hum with a disquieting energy. The walls are painted a drab, institutional green, attempting to mask the constant wear and tear. Motivational posters, slightly faded and curling at the edges, attempt to inject some semblance of optimism, but their effect is largely lost on the weary faces of the probation officers.

The air smells faintly of stale coffee, cheap disinfectant, and the lingering anxiety of countless individuals who have sat in those uncomfortable, molded plastic chairs, their futures hanging in the balance. The sound of ringing phones, the clickety-clack of keyboards, and the murmured conversations carry throughout the open-plan space, creating a constant, low-level hum that Beatrice has long since learned to tune out, even as it slowly grinds her down. It's a place of constant paperwork, mandated check-ins, and the perpetual dance between hope and disappointment that defines the lives of those trying to navigate the murky waters of the criminal justice system.
