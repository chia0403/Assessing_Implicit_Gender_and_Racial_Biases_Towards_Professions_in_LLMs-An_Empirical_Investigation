**Setting:** The bleary, pre-dawn chill clings to the air in downtown Providence, Rhode Island. Sleek, modern buildings rise like concrete and glass behemoths against the faint pink blush of the approaching sunrise, their reflective surfaces mirroring the rhythmic flashing lights of an ambulance parked haphazardly on Washington Street. A damp film coats everything – the slick cobblestones, the chrome bumper of the ambulance, even the weary faces of the crew huddled around the back.

She glanced at Marco, her grizzled paramedic partner, who was already securing the oxygen tank. He offered her a grim nod, his eyes reflecting the flashing lights, and a shared unspoken sentiment passed between them: another day, another miracle needed. Another life hanging in the balance. This city never slept, and neither did they.
