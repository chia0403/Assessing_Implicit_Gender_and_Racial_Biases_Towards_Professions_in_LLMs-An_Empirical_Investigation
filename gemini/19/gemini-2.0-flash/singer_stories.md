The spotlight hit Evelyn "Evie" Bell's face with the force of a physical blow. For a millisecond, everything went white, and the roar of the crowd seemed to shrink to a distant hum. Then, her vision cleared, and the cacophony exploded, the energy of five thousand people surging towards the stage like a tidal wave.

Evie, a wisp of a woman with a voice that could shatter glass and melt hearts in equal measure, took a deep breath. It wasn't the size of the crowd that got to her. It was the expectation. Every single person in that vast, echoing space, the renovated husk of the old Empire Theatre on Bleecker Street in New York City's Greenwich Village, had come to hear *her*. Theyâ€™d come to be moved, to be transported, to forget the grit and grind of the city for a few hours. And it was her job to deliver.

The Empire Theatre, though recently renovated, still carried the ghostly echoes of its past life. Peeling gold leaf framed the stage, and the velvet seats, even reupholstered, bore the faint impressions of countless rumps who had sat and dreamt within its walls. The air hung thick with the scent of stale beer, popcorn, and the phantom perfume of flapper girls long gone. It was a perfect, chaotic crucible for Evie's brand of bluesy soul, a place where history and heartbreak intertwined.

Behind her, the band, The Midnight Ramblers, launched into the opening riff of "City Lights," a song Evie had written during a particularly bleak winter, staring out at the glittering skyline from her tiny, roach-infested apartment in the East Village. Tonight, though, the lights didn't feel bleak. Tonight, they felt like possibilities. Tonight, Evelyn Bell was ready to sing.
