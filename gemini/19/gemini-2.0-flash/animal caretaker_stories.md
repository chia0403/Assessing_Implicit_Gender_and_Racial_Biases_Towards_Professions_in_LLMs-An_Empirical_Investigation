Okay, here's a story opening and setting, featuring a animal caretaker:

**Setting:**

The salty air hung thick and heavy, clinging to everything in a damp embrace. Isla Perdida, a small, volcanic island nestled a hundred miles off the coast of Baja California, was a riot of green clinging to black rock.  Giant saguaros stood sentinel over hidden canyons, while the crash of waves echoed perpetually against the jagged coastline. A small research station, barely more than a collection of whitewashed buildings and solar panels, clung precariously to the southern cliffs, overlooking a secluded cove. This was the home of the Isla Perdida Marine Research Institute, dedicated to the study and preservation of the island's unique ecosystem, particularly its population of critically endangered vaquitas.

**Opening:**

Beatrix Amelia Stone wiped a sheen of sweat from her brow with the back of her hand, leaving a smudge of fish scales on her forehead.  The air inside the vaquita enclosure, a series of interconnected saltwater pools carved into the volcanic rock, was stifling. The sun beat down mercilessly on the corrugated iron roof, turning the interior into a sweltering oven. "Come on, chicas," she murmured, her voice barely audible above the roar of the surf.  "Breakfast time." She hefted the bucket of freshly caught squid, the familiar scent drawing the attention of the two shy, charcoal-ringed eyes that peeked above the waterline of the largest pool. Elena and Esperanza, the last two vaquitas in human care, were notoriously fussy eaters. Beatrix, senior animal caretaker and practically a permanent resident of Isla Perdida for the last five years, knew every quirk, every preference, every subtle shift in their behavior.  But today, even the promise of their favorite cephalopod treat didn't seem to spark their usual enthusiasm. Elena remained submerged, while Esperanza only bobbed her head with a despondent sigh. A cold knot of dread tightened in Beatrix's stomach. Something was definitely wrong.
