## Story Opening:

The scent of aged paper and cinnamon assaulted Eliza Beatrice Thorne's nostrils as she wrestled with a particularly stubborn shelf. It groaned under the weight of centuries of accumulated knowledge, threatening to avalanche a precarious stack of Victorian poetry books onto the unsuspecting head of Mr. Henderson, the elderly gentleman currently snoozing in his usual armchair by the window. Eliza grunted, finally managing to shove the shelf back into place with a satisfying thud. Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun that streamed through the arched windows of the library, momentarily obscuring the meticulously organized rows of books. She wiped her brow with the back of her hand, leaving a faint smudge of grime on her forehead. Another day, another potential literary catastrophe averted at the Blackwood Library. 

## Setting:

The **Blackwood Library** is a gothic revival architectural marvel nestled in the sleepy, coastal town of Port Blossom, Maine. Its stone facade, covered in clinging ivy, gives it a sense of ancient mystery. Inside, the library is a labyrinthine warren of towering bookshelves that stretch towards the vaulted ceiling. Stained glass windows depicting historical literary figures cast vibrant hues across the polished wooden floors. The air is perpetually thick with the aroma of aging paper, leather, and a hint of beeswax polish, a testament to Eliza's meticulous care. The main reading room is dominated by a grand fireplace, which roars to life during the blustery Maine winters. Smaller, more secluded alcoves offer quiet spaces for reading and contemplation, while a winding staircase leads to the upper levels, rumored to house the library's more esoteric and restricted collection. Outside, a sprawling rose garden, meticulously maintained by the local garden club, provides a fragrant and colorful contrast to the library's imposing exterior. Port Blossom itself is a quiet town, steeped in maritime history and local legends, making the Blackwood Library a natural focal point for both residents and curious tourists alike.
