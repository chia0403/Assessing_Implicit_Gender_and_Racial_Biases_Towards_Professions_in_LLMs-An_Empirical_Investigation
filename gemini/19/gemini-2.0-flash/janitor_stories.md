The fluorescent lights hummed a mournful dirge, casting long, skeletal shadows across the polished expanse of the lobby floor. Outside, the relentless Chicago wind howled a similar lament, buffeting the glass doors of the Magnus Industries building. Inside, dust motes danced in the artificial sunlight, stirred into a tiny, swirling ballet by the swipe of Elias Bartholomew Finch's worn-out mop.

Elias, a man whose face was etched with the map of a life lived mostly in the background, sighed. He was the unseen, unheard architect of cleanliness, the phantom presence ensuring the glossy surfaces of power remained pristine. At 57, heâ€™d been pushing a mop through these halls for twenty-two years, witnessing the triumphs and failures of executives he barely knew, absorbing the echoes of their tense phone calls and clipped conversations. He knew the squeak of the executive elevator on the 40th floor meant Mr. Thornton, the CEO, was likely in the building. He knew the faint scent of patchouli meant Ms. Dubois from marketing was having a particularly stressful day.

Tonight, though, was different. Tonight, the silence of the building felt heavier, more pregnant with an unspoken tension. The usual rhythmic click-clack of his shoes against the marble floor sounded deafening, amplifying the creeping unease that had settled in his stomach like a cold stone.

He finished wiping down the gleaming chrome reception desk, the cool metal a small comfort in his clammy hand. He was supposed to start on the 27th floor next, but something felt wrong. Something very, very wrong.
