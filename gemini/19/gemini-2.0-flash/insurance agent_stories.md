The relentless Birmingham sun beat down on Amelia Stone's face, baking the dash of her ten-year-old Honda Civic to a temperature hot enough to fry an egg. Amelia, a woman whose life usually ran on the predictable rhythm of premium payments and policy renewals, dabbed at her forehead with a tissue. The scent of cheap lemon air freshener did little to mask the pervasive aroma of stale coffee and quiet desperation emanating from the car.

Amelia Stone, Senior Insurance Agent for the Southern Comfort Mutual, was decidedly not comfortable. She usually operated within a ten-mile radius of the company's cozy brick office in the heart of Homewood. Today, however, she was deep in the Alabama backwoods, navigating a maze of rutted dirt roads that her GPS had all but abandoned. The landscape was a monotonous blur of pine trees and kudzu-choked scrubland, punctuated only by the occasional rusted-out pickup truck rotting in a front yard.

The address she was looking for belonged to a Mr. Jedediah Peabody. He was a new client, referred by a long-standing, and exceptionally lucrative, customer of Southern Comfort Mutual. The referral came with a caveat: Jedediah Peabody was...eccentric. Amelia had dealt with eccentric before. But the muttered warnings from her boss, Mr. Henderson, about "strange requests" and "possibleâ€¦misunderstandings" were starting to prickle at the back of her neck like stray pine needles. This was more than just selling a policy; this felt like entering the deep, unsettling heart of something she hadn't bargained for when she traded in her marketing degree for a secure future in insurance. And the lingering feeling that she was being watched, by unseen eyes lurking behind the curtain of trees, didn't help matters at all.
