## The Setting:

The air in St. Augustine, Florida, hung thick and humid, even at 7:00 am. The rising sun, a hazy orange orb obscured by the morning mist clinging to the salt marsh, promised another scorcher. Ancient oaks, their branches draped with Spanish moss, lined the narrow streets, their gnarled roots pushing up through the crumbling brick sidewalks. Just off the Plaza de la Constituci√≥n, nestled between a touristy fudge shop and a t-shirt emporium, sat "Apothecary Aurelian," its sign a weathered, hand-painted affair.

Inside, the air was cooler, a delicate balance of menthol, lavender, and the subtle sweetness of compounding ingredients. Shelves, meticulously organized and made of dark, polished wood, stretched from floor to ceiling, laden with amber glass bottles, ceramic jars, and neatly labeled boxes. Sunlight streamed through the stained-glass window depicting the mythical Greek healer, Asclepius, casting colorful patterns on the checkered tile floor. The only sound was the gentle hum of the vintage refrigerator holding vaccines and other temperature-sensitive medications.

## The Story Opening:

**Penelope Aurelia Bloom**, pharmacist and owner of Apothecary Aurelian, squinted at the handwritten prescription, the wrinkles around her kind, hazel eyes deepening. She ran a hand through her perpetually messy bun of auburn hair, flecked with streaks of gray that she stubbornly refused to dye. The script was practically illegible, a doctor's signature reduced to a hurried squiggle.

"Amoxicillin...suspension..." she murmured, tracing the looping letters with a practiced finger. "For...Barnaby? Barnaby what?"

Sighing, Penelope pulled a small, silver-framed magnifying glass from her pocket and examined the document again. The name remained stubbornly indecipherable. "Dr. Ramirez and his hieroglyphs," she muttered, a familiar exasperation creeping into her voice. She reached for the phone, bracing herself for another frustrating conversation with the harried doctor's receptionist. Finding the right Barnaby and the appropriate dosage for his unknown ailment was just the first challenge of the day. And if past experience was anything to go by, the day was about to get a whole lot more complicated.
