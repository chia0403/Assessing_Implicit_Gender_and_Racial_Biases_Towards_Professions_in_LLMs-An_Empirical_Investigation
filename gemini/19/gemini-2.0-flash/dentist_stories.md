## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The stale air of Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Ainsworth's small-town dental practice hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and lingering fear. Her office, nestled above Mrs. Higgins' bakery on Elm Street in Havenwood, Maine, was a comforting anachronism in a world obsessed with gleaming, sterile efficiency. A faded landscape painting of Penobscot Bay, a gift from a grateful (and extremely nervous) patient, hung crookedly above a worn leather couch in the waiting room. The clatter of Mrs. Higgins' rolling pin, a rhythmic thump that Ellie found strangely soothing, permeated the thin floorboards. Outside, a dusting of early November snow hinted at the long, unforgiving winter to come.

**Opening:**

Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth hated fillings. Not the act of filling cavities, mind you â€“ she was a meticulous and skilled dentist, bordering on obsessive. No, Ellie hated the *sound* of the drill. That high-pitched whine, coupled with the panicked gulping of her patients, always sent a little shiver of dread down her spine. Today, the dreaded sound emanated from operatory one, where young Timmy Johnson was bravely enduring the reconstruction of his sugar-fueled carnage. Ellie, leaning against the doorframe of operatory two, pretending to meticulously polish a set of dentures (Mrs. Petunia's, bless her gums), could practically *taste* Timmy's fear. The air crackled with it, mixing with the cloying sweetness drifting up from the bakery below and the relentless, teeth-gritting whine of the drill.  She closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and reminded herself that she was saving the little tyke from a lifetime of dental misery.  Still, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was...off. More off than usual, that is. Havenwood was, after all, Havenwood. And in Havenwood, normal was often a relative term.
