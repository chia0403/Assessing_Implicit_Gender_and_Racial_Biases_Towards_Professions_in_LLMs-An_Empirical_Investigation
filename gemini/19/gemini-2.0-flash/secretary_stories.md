It echoed through the cavernous offices of Worthington & Finch, Architects, a firm renowned for its grandiose designs and Penelope’s particular brand of quiet efficiency. The setting was a sweltering July afternoon in Philadelphia. Sunlight streamed through the towering, arched windows, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the air and casting long, dramatic shadows across the mahogany reception desk where Penelope sat, her fingers poised delicately above the keyboard of her antiquated typewriter. The air conditioning was notoriously temperamental, alternating between glacial blasts and muggy stagnation, and today, it was definitely leaning towards the latter. Penelope, however, remained composed, her floral-printed dress crisp and unwrinkled, her hair a perfectly coiffed shade of auburn. She was the anchor in the storm of architect egos, the calm in the swirling vortex of blueprints and revisions, the only one who seemed to notice that Mr. Worthington, the senior partner, always took two lumps of sugar in his tea. And right now, she desperately wished he'd come out of his office so she could offer him a cup, just to break the oppressive silence and drown out the infernal ticking.
