## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The biting wind whipped off the Kenai Fjords in Alaska, carrying with it the scent of salt and the mournful cries of gulls. The small, weathered town of Seward clung precariously to the edge of Resurrection Bay, its colorful buildings a stark contrast to the rugged, snow-dusted mountains that loomed in the background. Inside the Seward Animal Clinic, a wood-burning stove struggled to hold back the Alaskan winter.

**Opening:**

Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Blake ran a hand through her perpetually messy, auburn braid, leaving a faint smear of antiseptic gel on her cheek. Steam fogged her glasses as she peered through the condensation clinging to the window. Outside, the swirling snow obscured the already dwindling daylight, making it look like the world was being slowly erased. She sighed, a puff of visible breath escaping her lips. Another snow squall. Perfect. Just what she needed on a day already crammed with a calving malamute, a sea otter with a fishing hook lodged in its flipper, and a particularly aggressive tomcat named Mr. Bigglesworth who seemed to take a personal offense to her existence.

Ellie straightened, a familiar ache settling in her lower back. It was a good kind of ache, though. A tired-from-a-day's-work ache. It reminded her that she was needed, that she was making a difference in this wild, unforgiving corner of the world. But as she glanced at the flashing red light on the clinic's emergency phone, she knew her day was far from over. She grabbed the receiver, a knot of apprehension tightening in her stomach. "Seward Animal Clinic, Dr. Blake speaking..."
