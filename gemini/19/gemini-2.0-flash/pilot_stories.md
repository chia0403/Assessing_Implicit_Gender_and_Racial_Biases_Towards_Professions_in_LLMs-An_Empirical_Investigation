The salt spray stung Amelia Jane Rutherford's face, the taste sharp and familiar as she squinted against the early morning sun. The dock at Port Townsend, Washington, was a hive of pre-dawn activity: fishermen mending nets, tourists bleary-eyed and clutching lukewarm coffees, and the rhythmic clang of rigging against masts. A low fog clung to the water, blurring the line between the steel-grey Puget Sound and the cloud-streaked sky.

Amelia, wrapped in a thick, well-worn leather bomber jacket despite the early-June warmth, adjusted the strap of her duffel bag, its canvas faded and softened with age. Inside lay her navigation charts, a worn copy of Saint-Exup√©ry's *Wind, Sand and Stars*, and a thermos of strong, black coffee. This wasn't her first dawn spent on this particular dock, nor her last, she suspected. It was, however, the start of perhaps her most audacious adventure yet. She was headed north. Far north.
