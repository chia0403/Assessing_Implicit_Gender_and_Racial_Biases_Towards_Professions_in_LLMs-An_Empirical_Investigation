## Story Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

The scent of lavender and lemon polish hung thick in the air, a testament to Dolores "Dee" Rodriguez's morningâ€™s work. She surveyed the gleaming mahogany table in the formal dining room, its surface reflecting the chandelier like a thousand tiny suns. Dee pursed her lips, adjusted the floral arrangement just so, and then stepped back, her shoulders slumping ever so slightly. It was perfect, pristine, exactly how Mrs. Vandergelt expected it. Perfect, and utterly devoid of life. 

Dee sighed, the sound lost in the cavernous room. Another Friday, another relentless pursuit of flawlessness in a house that held more secrets than rooms. And tonight, the Vandergelts would be hosting their annual charity gala, meaning even more scrutiny, even more demands, and even more champagne stains for her to magically erase by Monday morning. God, she needed a strong cup of coffee.

**Setting:**

The Vandergelt Mansion, nestled high on a manicured bluff overlooking the Pacific Ocean in La Jolla, California, was a monument to old money and ostentatious displays of wealth. Its Spanish Colonial Revival architecture boasted terracotta roofs, arched doorways, and intricate wrought iron details, all painted in a pristine, almost blinding, white. Lush gardens, meticulously maintained by a team of groundskeepers, cascaded down the cliffside, leading to a private beach accessible only by a winding stone staircase.

Inside, the mansion was a dizzying labyrinth of opulent rooms filled with priceless antiques, original artwork, and enough crystal to blind a small army. Each room was designed to impress, to showcase the Vandergelts' impeccable taste (or rather, their interior designer's impeccable taste), and to subtly remind visitors of their elevated social standing. The formal areas, like the dining room and grand ballroom, were cold and imposing, while even the more intimate spaces, like the library and sitting rooms, felt sterile and untouched, like museum exhibits rather than places to actually live.
