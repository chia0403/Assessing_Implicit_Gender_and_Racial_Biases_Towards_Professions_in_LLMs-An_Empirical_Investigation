## Story Opening:

The stale scent of microwaved coffee and quiet desperation hung heavy in the air, a perfume familiar to anyone who lingered too long past closing bell on the trading floor. Bartholomew "Barry" Finch adjusted his tie, the silk suddenly feeling like a noose. He hated working late, but tonight was different. Tonight, his meticulously crafted strategy, the one he'd staked his reputation on, was bleeding out in the after-market. 

The green numbers, the sweet promise of profit, had curdled into a sickly, pulsating red. He watched, mesmerized by the downward spiral of "Solaris Energy," a renewable energy company he’d been touting to his clients for months. It had been his golden ticket, his chance to finally climb out of the middle-management mire and into the lucrative world of private wealth management. Now, it looked more like a one-way ticket to oblivion.

He swiveled his chair away from the bank of monitors, the glare suddenly too painful. He couldn't bear to look at the carnage any longer. He just needed a moment to breathe, to find a flicker of hope in the suffocating gloom of his impending failure.

## Setting:

The scene takes place within the sleek, yet impersonal, offices of **Goldman Sterling & Hayes, a prestigious investment firm located on the 37th floor of the Liberty Tower in downtown Manhattan.** Floor-to-ceiling windows offer a breathtaking view of the cityscape, glittering like a fallen constellation. But tonight, the lights of the city only serve to highlight the emptiness of the office. Most of the trading floor is dark and silent, the cacophony of the day replaced by the hum of the server room and the distant wail of a siren. Polished chrome and dark wood dominate the décor, a testament to the firm's wealth and power. The atmosphere is sterile, almost clinical, a stark contrast to the chaotic and unpredictable world of the stock market that thrives within its walls. Even the air itself seems to crackle with the unspoken pressure of millions of dollars changing hands, fortunes being made and lost.
