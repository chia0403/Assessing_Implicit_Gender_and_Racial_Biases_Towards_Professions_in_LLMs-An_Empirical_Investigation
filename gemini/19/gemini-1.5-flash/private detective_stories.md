The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Jack Stratton's office, a rhythm that mirrored the frantic beat of his own heart.  Jack, or “Jackie” as the less-than-savoury clientele sometimes called him, wasn't used to feeling this unsettled.

Tonight, however, the usual aroma was overpowered by the cloying sweetness of lilies, a floral assault that clashed violently with the gritty reality of his profession.  The lilies sat in a chipped porcelain vase on his battered oak desk, beside a photograph – a blurry, grainy image of a young woman with laughing eyes, eyes that now stared accusingly from the shadows.  This was no ordinary missing person's case. This smelled like trouble, and trouble, Jackie Stratton knew, often came with a price.
