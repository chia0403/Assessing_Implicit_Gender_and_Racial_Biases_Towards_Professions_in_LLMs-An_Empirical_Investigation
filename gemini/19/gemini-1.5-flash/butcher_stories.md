The air hung thick and sweet, a cloying blend of iron and rendered fat that clung to the back of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's throat.  It was a familiar scent, one that had permeated his life since he was a boy, tracing the sawdust-strewn floors of Butterfield's Fine Meats, a butcher shop nestled on the cobbled side street of Grimsborough, a town clinging stubbornly to the edge of the brooding Blackwood Forest.  The shop, a relic of a bygone era, was squeezed between a perpetually failing milliner's and a surprisingly thriving apothecary, its stained-glass window – depicting a rather plump, contented pig – cracked in three places, a testament to a particularly rambunctious hailstorm last spring.  Inside, the chill of the morning hung heavy amidst the gleaming rows of silver hooks, each burdened with its own silent, soon-to-be-silent story. Barty, his hands stained a deep crimson, honed his cleaver with a practiced ease, the rhythmic *shink-shink* a counterpoint to the steady drip, drip, drip of melting ice from the butcher's block.
