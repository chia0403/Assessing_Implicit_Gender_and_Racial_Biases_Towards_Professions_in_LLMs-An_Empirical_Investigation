The biting Antarctic wind howled a mournful song around Captain Evelyn "Evie" Reed's battered Lockheed Electra, the propellers churning a frenzy of snow into the already blinding blizzard.  Visibility was down to near zero, the icy landscape a swirling vortex of white nothingness that swallowed the horizon whole.  Evie, her breath misting in the frigid cockpit air, gripped the controls with knuckles white as the frozen wastes outside.  The radio crackled with static, a mocking counterpoint to the relentless drumming of the propellers â€“ the only sounds, besides the frantic thump-thump-thump of her own heart, in this desolate, unforgiving expanse of the McMurdo Sound.  Her mission: a desperate supply run to the isolated research station at the South Pole, a lifeline tethered by a single, fragile thread of hope against the encroaching darkness of the polar winter.
