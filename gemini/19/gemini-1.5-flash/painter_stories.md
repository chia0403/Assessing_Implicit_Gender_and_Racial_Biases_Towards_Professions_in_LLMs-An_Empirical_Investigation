The biting November wind whipped Amelia Katherine Blackwood’s auburn hair across her face as she wrestled the heavy easel into the crumbling stone archway.  Salt spray, thick as a painter's impasto, stung her eyes, carrying the sharp tang of the sea and the fainter, sweeter scent of seaweed clinging to the jagged rocks below.  She stood on the windswept headland overlooking the churning grey expanse of the Atlantic, the skeletal branches of ancient wind-battered oaks clawing at the bruised sky.  The tiny, almost forgotten fishing village of Portwenn huddled below, a cluster of slate-roofed cottages clinging precariously to the cliffside like barnacles to a ship's hull. This was Amelia’s sanctuary, her canvas, her muse – a place where the raw power of nature roared its approval, or its disapproval, with equal ferocity.  The canvas, still pristine white, waited patiently for her touch, a blank page in the epic poem of the storm brewing before her.
