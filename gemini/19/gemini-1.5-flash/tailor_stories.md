The scent of woodsmoke and damp wool hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Elias Thorne, master tailor of Oakhaven.  Rain lashed against the leaded-glass windows of his shop, a rhythmic drumming that punctuated the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of his shears.  Elias, his brow furrowed in concentration, meticulously guided a length of emerald green velvet through the needle, his nimble fingers a blur against the rich fabric.  Oakhaven, nestled in a valley perpetually shrouded in mist, was a town steeped in ancient secrets and shadowed by the looming presence of Blackwood Forest, a place where whispers of forgotten magic lingered like the clinging dampness itself.  The flickering gaslight above his workbench cast long, dancing shadows across the cluttered space, highlighting bolts of shimmering silk, rolls of sturdy linen, and a half-finished coat of midnight blue waiting patiently for its final touches.  Tonight, however, Elias was not occupied with the usual commissions from the townsfolk.  Tonight, he was working on something far moreâ€¦ significant.
