A cacophony of sounds assaulted him: the plinking of a grand piano in the adjacent lounge, the hushed murmur of clandestine meetings in shadowed corners, and the incessant clatter of the hotel's ancient elevator struggling to ascend its rickety shaft. Outside, a storm raged, mirroring the turmoil that Gus felt brewing within his own chest. This wasn't just another busy night at the Grand Majestic; tonight felt different, charged with a peculiar energy that prickled at the edges of his senses.
