The recycled air hung thick and sweet with the cloying scent of cheap perfume and stale coffee, a familiar perfume to Seraphina "Sera" Dubois.  Outside, the Auckland sky bled bruised purple and orange as the final rays of the setting sun kissed the Tasman Sea.  Sera, perched precariously on a fold-out seat in the almost-empty Air New Zealand 787's galley, meticulously polished a champagne flute, the act a soothing balm against the jagged edges of her latest flight.  The chaotic energy of a delayed departure, a screaming baby, and a particularly demanding passenger who'd insisted on being addressed as "Lord Harrington" even though his boarding pass clearly read "Harold Higgins," still vibrated in the cramped space.  The quiet hum of the engines, now fading as the ground crew worked around the aircraft, was a welcome respite.  Tonight, however, the familiar comfort felt tinged with something else entirely â€“ a premonition, sharp and unsettling, that this particular end to a long day was anything but ordinary.
