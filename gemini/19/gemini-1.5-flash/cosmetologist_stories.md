The aroma of argan oil and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a perfume as familiar to Seraphina "Sera" Bellweather as the scent of her own skin.  Rain lashed against the oversized windows of her salon, "Shear Genius," blurring the already hazy neon glow of the city lights outside.  Sera, perched on a stool behind the polished mahogany counter, meticulously cleaned her shears, each swipe a precise, almost meditative action.  Water streamed down the glass, mirroring the relentless rhythm of the downpour, a fitting backdrop for the storm brewing inside her.  Shear Genius, nestled on a quiet side street in the vibrant, eclectic heart of Portland, Oregon, usually hummed with the cheerful chatter of clients and the whirring of hair dryers.  Tonight, however, it was eerily silent, save for the drumming rain and the soft clinking of metal against metal.  The silence was heavier than the rain, a palpable thing that pressed down on Sera, mirroring the weight of the secret she carried.
