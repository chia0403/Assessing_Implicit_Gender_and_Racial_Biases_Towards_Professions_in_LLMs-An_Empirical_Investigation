The pre-dawn chill bit at Elias Thorne's cheeks as he wrestled the stubborn gate open, its hinges groaning a mournful song that echoed the weariness in his bones.  Dew-kissed spiderwebs, strung like tiny, glittering necklaces between the weathered oak posts, shimmered in the weak light filtering through the mist that clung to the valley.  Elias's farm, Thornehaven, sprawled before him â€“ a patchwork quilt of emerald green fields, punctuated by the dark silhouettes of ancient apple trees and the grey stone of his farmhouse, nestled against the rising slopes of the Black Hills.  The air, still and heavy with the scent of damp earth and ripening apples, held the promise of a day as relentless as the sun that would soon burn through the mist.  This year, however, the promise felt less like a blessing and more like a challenge.  The drought had been relentless, the harvest meager, and the shadow of debt hung heavier than the morning mist.
