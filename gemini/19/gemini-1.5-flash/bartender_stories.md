The chipped Formica bar top felt cool beneath Elias Thorne’s fingertips as he polished a glass, the rhythmic swish of the cloth a counterpoint to the low hum of conversation in the dimly lit "Rusty Mug." Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the tavern, blurring the neon glow of the "Liquor & Lies" sign across the street into a hazy, psychedelic smear.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of stale beer, spilled whiskey, and the faint, almost imperceptible sweetness of Elias's signature lavender and honey syrup – a detail most patrons wouldn't notice, but one that provided a small, quiet comfort in the heart of this rough-and-tumble waterfront district.
