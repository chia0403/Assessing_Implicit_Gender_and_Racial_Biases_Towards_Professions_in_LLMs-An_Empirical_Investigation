The greasy scent of burnt motor oil hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Amelia “Mia” Hernandez.  Fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune above her, casting a sickly yellow glow on the cluttered workbench of Hernandez Auto Repair.  Tools – wrenches of every size, screwdrivers with worn handles, and a collection of oddly shaped sockets that only Mia could identify – were scattered across the scarred metal surface, a testament to years of tireless work.  Outside, the late afternoon sun bled crimson and orange across the dusty landscape of the Nevada desert, painting the distant mountains in hues of fire.  The only sound louder than the humming lights was the rhythmic thrum of a vintage Mustang's engine, idling patiently – and hopefully – on the lift in the bay behind her.  Mia, her hands stained with grime and her brow furrowed in concentration, tightened a bolt with practiced ease, her dark eyes reflecting the flickering light.  This wasn't just a job; it was a conversation, a puzzle she loved to solve, one rusty nut and bolt at a time.
