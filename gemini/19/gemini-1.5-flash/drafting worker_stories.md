The fluorescent lights of the drafting room hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *click-click-click* of Amelia Grace Hawthorne's mechanical pencil.  Dust motes, illuminated in the harsh glare, danced in the stagnant air above her meticulously organized desk, a miniature landscape of rulers, protractors, and half-empty coffee cups.  The air itself smelled faintly of stale blueprints and desperation; the kind that clung to the walls of the Blackwood & Sons architectural firm like a persistent damp stain. Amelia, her brow furrowed in concentration, painstakingly adjusted a fine line on the intricate blueprint spread before her â€“ the proposed expansion of the city's already-overburdened library.  Outside, the Chicago wind howled a mournful dirge, a stark contrast to the sterile, almost suffocating calm of the office.  But Amelia barely registered it; her world was contained within the precise lines and shaded areas of her current task, a world built not of bricks and mortar, but of meticulously rendered possibilities.
