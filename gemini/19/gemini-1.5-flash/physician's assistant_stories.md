The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Mia" Hernandez's hair across her face as she hurried down the cobbled street, the collar of her worn peacoat pulled high.  The scent of woodsmoke and roasting chestnuts battled with the underlying tang of brine and decay that clung persistently to the air in Port Blossom, a picturesque fishing village clinging precariously to the craggy cliffs of the Maine coast.  Lanterns cast a flickering, uneven light on the narrow street, illuminating the damp, grey stone buildings huddled together like gossiping old women.  Mia, her breath misting in the frigid air, pushed open the heavy oak door of the Port Blossom Clinic, the bell above it jingling a discordant welcome.  Inside, the air was warmer, though no less damp, carrying the familiar sterile scent of antiseptic and the faint, underlying sweetness of overripe apples from the fruit bowl on the receptionist's desk.
