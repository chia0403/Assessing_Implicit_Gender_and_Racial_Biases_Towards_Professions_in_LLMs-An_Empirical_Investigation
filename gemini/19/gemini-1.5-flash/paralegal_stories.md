The flickering neon sign of the "Golden Gator Lounge" cast a lurid green glow across the rain-slicked asphalt of Duval Street.  Amelia Hernandez, her sensible beige raincoat doing little to shield her from the Key West humidity, shivered not from the damp chill but from a premonition that tonight would be anything but sensible.  Amelia, a paralegal at the prestigious (if slightly disheveled) firm of  Fitzwilliam & Fitzwilliam, usually spent her evenings alphabetizing files and battling rogue staplers. Tonight, however, she was armed with nothing but a battered legal pad, a half-eaten bag of Key lime cookies, and a growing sense of dread.  The salty air, usually a balm to her city-weary soul, felt thick with the promise of trouble â€“ the kind that smelled faintly of cheap rum and impending litigation.
