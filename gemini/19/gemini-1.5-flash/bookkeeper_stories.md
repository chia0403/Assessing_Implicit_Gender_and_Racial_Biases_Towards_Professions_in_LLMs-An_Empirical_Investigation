The chipped paint of Amelia Grace Hawthorne's desk matched the chipped state of her own optimism.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows of "Hawthorne & Son Accounting," a name that felt increasingly ironic considering her father, the "Son," had retired to a sun-drenched villa in the Algarve three years ago, leaving Amelia to wrestle with the dusty ledgers and perpetually late clients of their dwindling practice.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee, aging paper, and a faint, persistent whiff of desperation â€“ a smell Amelia had come to recognize as the aroma of her own life.  Outside, the November wind howled a mournful tune that mirrored the melancholic clinking of the ancient adding machine on her desk, a relic from a time when bookkeepers held a position of real prestige, a time that felt as distant as the Algarve itself.
