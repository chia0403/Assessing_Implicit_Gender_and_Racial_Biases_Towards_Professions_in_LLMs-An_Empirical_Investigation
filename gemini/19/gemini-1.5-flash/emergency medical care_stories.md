The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Mia" Hernandez's hair across her face as she wrestled the heavy canvas door of the ambulance open.  The air, thick with the metallic tang of blood and the cloying sweetness of antiseptic, hung heavy in the cramped space.  Sirens wailed a mournful counterpoint to the frantic thump-thump-thump of her own heart, a rhythm she'd come to know intimately during her five years as a paramedic with the Redwood City Emergency Medical Services.  Tonight, however, the familiar adrenaline rush felt different, laced with a chilling premonition that hung heavier than the damp fog clinging to the coastal highway.  The call had come in as a "possible cardiac arrest," a vague enough description to be anything from a minor episode to… well, Mia didn't like to dwell on the possibilities. The flickering streetlights of Pescadero cast long, skeletal shadows across the rain-slicked road as she surveyed the scene – a secluded beach house, perched precariously on a cliff overlooking the churning Pacific. The only sound louder than the ocean's roar was the rhythmic, shallow breathing of the patient already waiting for her inside.
