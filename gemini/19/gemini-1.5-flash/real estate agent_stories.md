The salt spray stung Aurelia “Reli” Blackwood’s face as she wrestled the stubborn “For Sale” sign into the wind-whipped sand.  The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum in the rapidly darkening sky, cast long shadows across the desolate stretch of beach bordering the dilapidated Victorian mansion behind her.  Seagulls cried overhead, their calls a mournful counterpoint to the rhythmic crash of waves against the jagged rocks jutting from the churning grey Atlantic.  This wasn’t exactly the picturesque postcard view Reli usually associated with her high-end real estate listings.  In fact, Widow’s Point, as the locals grimly called the property, felt more like a scene from a gothic novel than a prime piece of coastal real estate.  The air, thick with the smell of brine and something faintly…rotten, hinted at more than just the usual seaside tang.  Reli shivered, pulling her cashmere wrap tighter, a stark contrast to the weathered grey shingles and ominous shadows of the house looming behind her.
