The scent of cinnamon and sandalwood hung heavy in the air, a peculiar counterpoint to the sterile tang of antiseptic that usually dominated Apothecary Amelia Hawthorne's workday.  Rain lashed against the leaded-glass windows of Hawthorne's Apothecary, a rambling Victorian building nestled on a cobbled side street in the perpetually twilight town of Oakhaven.  Gas lamps flickered weakly in the downpour, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to writhe across the shelves laden with jars filled with dried herbs, exotic spices, and gleaming, enigmatic potions.  Amelia, her auburn hair pulled back in a severe bun that did little to soften her sharp, intelligent features, adjusted the spectacles perched on her nose and sighed, the sound barely audible above the rhythmic drumming of the rain.  Tonight, however, the usual quiet hum of her apothecary was broken by an unsettling silence â€“ a silence heavier than the storm raging outside.
