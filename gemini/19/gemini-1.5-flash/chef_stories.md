The air hung thick and humid, a steamy blanket woven from the scent of roasting chiles, simmering spices, and the faint, metallic tang of blood.  Chef Jean-Pierre Dubois, his brow slick with perspiration despite the strategically placed industrial fans whirring overhead, surveyed his chaotic yet controlled kingdom.  The kitchen of "La Fleur de Sel," nestled in the heart of the bustling Marrakech medina, was a vibrant tapestry of sights and sounds:  the rhythmic clang of cleavers echoing against the ancient terracotta walls, the hurried whispers of sous chefs darting between steaming woks and bubbling tagines, the vibrant colors of a thousand spices spilling from open sacks.  Tonight was the annual Sultan's Feast, and Jean-Pierre, despite his years of experience in Michelin-starred kitchens across Europe, felt a familiar tremor of nervous energy thrumming beneath his carefully controlled exterior.  The success of this event, the pinnacle of his Moroccan culinary career, rested entirely on his shoulders.
