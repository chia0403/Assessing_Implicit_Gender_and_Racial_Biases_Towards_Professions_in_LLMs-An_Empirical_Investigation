The scent of turpentine and old varnish hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Aurelia “Rella” Blackwood.  Rella, however, found little comfort in it this morning.  Dust motes danced in the slivers of sunlight piercing the gloom of the abandoned Victorian mansion, each mote a tiny, irritating reminder of the monumental task ahead.  The house, perched precariously on a windswept cliff overlooking the churning grey Atlantic, groaned under the weight of decades of neglect.  Sea spray, driven by a relentless November gale, lashed against the tall, gothic windows, a mournful counterpoint to the rhythmic creak of settling timbers.  Rella shivered, pulling her thick wool coat tighter, less against the cold and more against the palpable sense of melancholy that clung to the place like a shroud. This wasn't just another renovation; this was Blackwood Manor, a project whispered about in hushed tones amongst the local gossips, a place steeped in legend and, according to rumour, a very unwelcome resident.
