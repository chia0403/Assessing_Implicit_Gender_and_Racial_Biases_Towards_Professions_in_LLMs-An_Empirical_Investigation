The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s auburn hair across her face as she hurried down the rain-slicked cobblestones of Charleston’s historic French Quarter.  The scent of jasmine, usually a comforting balm, was overwhelmed tonight by the sharp tang of salt spray and the damp earthiness of decaying Spanish moss hanging heavy from the ancient oaks.  Rain hammered against the worn brick facades of the centuries-old buildings, reflecting the dim, flickering gaslights in shimmering pools on the pavement.  Amelia pulled her worn leather satchel tighter against her, its contents – a well-worn copy of *Gray's Anatomy* and a tangle of knotted therapy bands – jostling against her ribs.  Tonight, however, her usual post-work weariness was overshadowed by a nervous energy that prickled at the edges of her composure.  Her appointment wasn’t at her clinic, nestled amongst the boutiques and art galleries of King Street. Tonight, Amelia was making a house call – a peculiar one, at that – to a residence shrouded in mystery and, judging by the hushed whispers she'd overheard at the local apothecary, shrouded in something far more sinister.
