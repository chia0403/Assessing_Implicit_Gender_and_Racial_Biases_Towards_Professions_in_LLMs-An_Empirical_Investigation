The wind, a relentless sculptor, carved patterns into the snowdrifts that blanketed the Broken Spur Ranch.  It howled a mournful dirge through the skeletal branches of the junipers, a soundtrack to the deepening twilight.  Inside the ranch house, however, a roaring fire in the hearth fought back against the encroaching cold, casting flickering shadows that danced on the weathered face of  Elias Thorne.  Elias, a man etched by sun and hardship, sat nursing a mug of steaming coffee, the aroma a faint counterpoint to the sharp tang of pine and frozen earth that permeated the air.  Outside, the Wyoming sky, a bruised purple and bleeding orange, promised another brutal night.  Elias, however, showed little concern.  Heâ€™d faced worse.  He'd faced everything Broken Spur could throw at him, and he intended to face whatever the coming dawn held with the same stubborn resolve that had kept him and his ranch alive for fifty years.
