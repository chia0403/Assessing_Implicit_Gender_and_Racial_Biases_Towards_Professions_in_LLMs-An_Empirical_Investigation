The salt spray stung Seraphina Moreau’s face, a familiar kiss from the unforgiving Atlantic.  She perched precariously on the jagged rocks jutting out from the craggy cliffs of Île de Sein, the wind whipping her dark hair around her like a frantic, unseen hand.  Below, the churning grey sea gnawed at the base of the island, a relentless symphony of power and chaos.  Seraphina, however, wasn't focused on the tempestuous ocean; her gaze was fixed on the swirling, bruised sky above, a canvas of bruised purples and angry oranges bleeding into the fading light.  Her easel, battered and sea-worn like the island itself, stood beside her, a defiant sentinel against the elements.  A half-finished painting, a vibrant explosion of colour starkly contrasting with the muted greys of the storm-wracked landscape, leaned against it.  This was her sanctuary, this windswept, unforgiving island; her muse, her tormentor, and the source of her extraordinary, if somewhat melancholic, art.
