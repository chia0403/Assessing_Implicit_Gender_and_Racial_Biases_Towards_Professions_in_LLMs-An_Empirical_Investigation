The fluorescent lights of the Meadowbrook Medical Center hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* of Amelia Katherine “Amy” Holloway’s own heart.  It wasn’t the usual pre-shift jitters; Amy, a phlebotomist with five years under her belt at Meadowbrook, had a stomach-churning sense of foreboding that clung to her like the lingering scent of antiseptic.  This wasn't the sterile, clinical smell of the lab; this was something else entirely – a metallic tang, almost like…fear.  Outside, a late autumn wind rattled the windowpanes, carrying with it the damp chill of the approaching storm and the rustling of leaves – a far cry from the hushed, controlled chaos within the bustling phlebotomy room.  Today, however, even the usual controlled chaos felt different, charged with a tension Amy couldn't quite place.  The usual pre-dawn bustle of nurses and doctors prepping for the day’s appointments was punctuated by an unnerving silence, a stillness that seemed to amplify the rhythmic ticking of the wall clock.
