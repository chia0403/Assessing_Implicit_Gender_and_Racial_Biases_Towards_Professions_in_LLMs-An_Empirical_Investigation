The scent of ozone hung heavy in the air, a metallic tang clinging to the damp strands of hair clinging to Amelia Grace Hawthorne's shears. Rain lashed against the warped, single-paned window of her tiny salon, "Snips & Suds," blurring the already indistinct neon glow of the liquor store across the street.  Amelia, her fingers stained a kaleidoscope of dye from a particularly vibrant client earlier that day, sighed, the sound swallowed by the rhythmic drumming of the rain.  Inside, the salon was a comforting chaos: the scent of lavender shampoo battling with the lingering sweetness of caramel from the spilled treat a child had left earlier, a half-finished crossword puzzle lay abandoned on the counter beside a chipped mug of lukewarm tea, and a lone, slightly-wilted sunflower drooped in a chipped ceramic vase. This was Amelia's kingdom, a haven built within the weathered walls of a once-grand Victorian building in the perpetually rain-soaked town of Port Blossom.
