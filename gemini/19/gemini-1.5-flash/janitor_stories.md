The fluorescent lights of the Blackwood Academy hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic squeak of Amelia Katherine Finch’s mop.  Amelia, or Amy as everyone except the Headmaster – and he rarely used her name – called her, pushed the mop across the polished terrazzo floor of the main hall, the scent of lemon-scented cleaner battling with the lingering aroma of old wood and aged parchment.  Blackwood Academy, a gothic monstrosity perched precariously on a windswept cliff overlooking the churning grey Atlantic, was never truly quiet, even at 2 am.  The wind howled like a banshee outside, rattling the ancient leaded windows, and within the shadowed corners of the building,  a thousand whispers seemed to cling to the dust motes dancing in the weak light.  Tonight, however, the whispers felt sharper, colder than usual. Amy shivered, not entirely from the draft. Something felt…off.
