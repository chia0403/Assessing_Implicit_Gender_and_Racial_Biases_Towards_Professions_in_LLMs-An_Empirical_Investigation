The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s auburn hair across her face as she hurried down the rain-slicked street, the collar of her waterproof jacket pulled high.  The streetlights of Charleston, South Carolina, cast a dim, watery glow on the cobblestones, reflecting in the puddles that gathered at the base of the ancient live oaks draped in Spanish moss.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying magnolia blossoms, carried a distinct undercurrent – the metallic tang of blood.  Amelia, a registered nurse at Charleston Memorial Hospital, felt a familiar knot tighten in her stomach.  This wasn't just the usual late-night chill; this felt… different.  The emergency room call hadn't specified the nature of the incident, only the urgency.  But the silence that preceded the frantic call, the unspoken dread hanging heavy in the air even over the phone, told her something far more sinister was afoot.
