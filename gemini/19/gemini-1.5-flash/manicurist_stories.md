Outside, the relentless Miami sun beat down on the pastel-colored buildings of Little Havana, but inside Serenity Nails, a cool, almost artificial calm reigned – a fragile bubble of tranquility that Esme was desperately trying to maintain.  This particular Tuesday, however, threatened to burst it wide open.
