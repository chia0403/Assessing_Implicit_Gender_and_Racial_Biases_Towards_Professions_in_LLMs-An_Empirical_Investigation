The humid air hung thick and heavy, a shimmering haze above the polished wooden floor of "Body & Soul Fitness."  Sweat beaded on the forehead of Amelia "Amy" Hernandez, even though she wasn't the one currently leading the 6 AM spin class.  Amy, a whirlwind of energy usually commanding the room with her infectious laugh and motivational shouts, was instead perched on a low stool in the corner, nursing a lukewarm mug of chamomile tea and observing the class with a strangely detached air.  The rhythmic pounding of twenty spinning bikes, the driving beat of the instructor's chosen playlist, usually a soundtrack to her own vibrant energy, felt oddly distant tonight, like the muffled thrum of a distant drum. The pre-dawn light filtering through the large studio windows cast long shadows, painting the usually bright space in muted tones of grey and purple.  Something was off.  Something was profoundly, unsettlingly wrong.
