The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Amy” Hernandez’s hair across her face as she surveyed the skeletal remains of the old Oakhaven High School football field.

The scent of damp earth and decaying leaves hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the smell of freshly cut grass and liniment she usually associated with the beginning of a season. This year felt different; this year felt like the end.
