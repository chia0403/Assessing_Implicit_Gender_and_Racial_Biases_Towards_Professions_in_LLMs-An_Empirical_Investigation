The wind, a snarling beast with teeth of grit and ice, clawed at Elias Thorne's worn leather gloves as he perched precariously on the gabled roof of the Blackwood Manor.  Below, the sprawling Victorian mansion, a gothic behemoth of crumbling stone and weeping willows, hunched under a sky the color of bruised plums.  November in Blackwood, Massachusetts, was never gentle, and this year, it felt particularly vicious.  Elias, a man whose calloused hands had felt the sting of a thousand winter winds, braced himself against the gust, the rhythmic clang of his hammer momentarily silenced by the storm’s fury. The slate tiles under his boots, slick with recent rain, threatened to send him tumbling into the overgrown garden below, a prospect that held little appeal.  His breath plumed out in white clouds, mirroring the swirling mists that clung to the valley like a shroud. This was Elias Thorne’s office, a precarious perch three stories high, and tonight, his office was trying to kill him.
