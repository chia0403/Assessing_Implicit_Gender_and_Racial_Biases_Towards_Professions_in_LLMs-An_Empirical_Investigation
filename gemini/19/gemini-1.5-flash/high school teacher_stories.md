The chipped paint of the "Welcome to Northwood High" sign peeled away like sunburnt skin, mirroring the slow, agonizing unraveling of Ms. Eleanor Vance's patience.  September in Northwood, Oregon, was usually a gentle drizzle of optimism, a fresh start scented with woodsmoke and damp earth.  This year, however, felt different.  A thick, cloying humidity hung in the air, mirroring the suffocating tension that seemed to cling to the hallways of Northwood High like a persistent, unwelcome guest.  The usually vibrant school, nestled between the brooding shadow of Mount Rainier and the restless churn of the Pacific, felt… stagnant.  Eleanor, adjusting her glasses and tightening the knot of her already-too-tight cardigan, sighed.  Another year, another crop of teenagers wrestling with algebra, angst, and the existential dread of impending pop quizzes. This year, however, felt heavier, more… fraught.  The subtle tremor in the earth, she thought, was not just the seismic activity of the region; it was the tremor of something far more unsettling brewing within the school's aging brick walls.
