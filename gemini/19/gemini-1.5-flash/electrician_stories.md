The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face as he wrestled the unwieldy coil of marine-grade cable onto the deck of the *Seraphina*.  The fishing trawler, a battered veteran of countless storms, pitched precariously in the choppy waters of the North Sea.  Grey skies pressed down like a damp wool blanket, mirroring the grim expression etched onto Elias's weathered face.  The biting wind howled a mournful tune through the rigging, a constant reminder of the isolated, unforgiving environment he'd found himself in – a hundred miles off the coast of Scotland, with a dead engine and a rapidly dwindling supply of patience.  His toolbox, a testament to years spent battling the elements and temperamental machinery, lay open beside him, its contents scattered amidst the chaos of a half-completed repair. The air smelled of diesel, fish, and the sharp tang of the sea itself – a potent cocktail that Elias had come to know intimately over his two decades as an electrician specializing in maritime work.
