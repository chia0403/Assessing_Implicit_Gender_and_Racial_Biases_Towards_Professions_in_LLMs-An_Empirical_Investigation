The fluorescent lights of Dr. Albright's Dental hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the otherwise silent, pre-dawn hours.  Dust motes, illuminated like tiny planets, danced in the pale beams.  Outside, the city of Portland, Oregon, still slumbered, a blanket of mist clinging to the Willamette River.  But inside,  Isabelle "Izzy" Moreau, a dental hygienist with hands as steady as a surgeon's and a smile that could melt glacial ice, was already at work.  The sterile scent of antiseptic mingled with the faint, sweet aroma of coffee brewing in the breakroom â€“ a familiar and comforting combination that usually heralded the start of a busy day.  Today, however, felt different.  A nervous energy prickled at the edges of Izzy's usually calm demeanor.  A new patient was scheduled for 7:00 AM, and the details on his chart were... unsettling.
