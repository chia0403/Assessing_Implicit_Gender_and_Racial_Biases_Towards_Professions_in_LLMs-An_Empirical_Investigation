The scent of sandalwood and bergamot hung heavy in the air, a comforting balm against the relentless November rain lashing against the frosted-glass windows of Serenity Now Massage Therapy.  Rain, Elara Vance thought, was the perfect soundtrack for a good rub-down.  The rhythmic drumming on the panes was almost hypnotic, a soothing counterpoint to the low hum of the aromatherapy diffuser and the gentle sigh of her latest client, a particularly stressed-out accountant named Mr. Henderson whose shoulders resembled a pair of tightly-wound springs.  Elara, with her long, nimble fingers and a touch that could melt glaciers, was already working on untangling the knots, her own weariness forgotten in the quiet intensity of her work.  Outside, the world was a grey, blustery mess; inside, Serenity Now was an island of calm, a sanctuary built on the promise of release and renewal.
