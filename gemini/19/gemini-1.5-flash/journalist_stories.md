The chipped paint of the windowsill flaked onto Amelia “Amy” Holloway’s worn leather notebook, a silent counterpoint to the relentless drone of cicadas vibrating the humid Louisiana air.  Sweat beaded on her forehead, mirroring the condensation clinging to the frosty glass of sweet tea in her hand.  The air hung thick and heavy, a palpable blanket woven from the scent of decaying magnolia blossoms and the cloying sweetness of honeysuckle.  Amy, a journalist for the *New Orleans Advocate*, perched precariously on the rickety porch of a shotgun house, its paint peeling like sunburnt skin, overlooking the sluggish bayou.  The setting sun cast long, skeletal shadows across the overgrown cypress trees, their gnarled roots clawing at the muddy banks.  This wasn't the glamorous assignment she'd hoped for, but the disappearance of fisherman Silas Dubois, a local legend whispered about in hushed tones, had a scent of something far more sinister than a simple boating accident.  And Amy Holloway, despite the relentless heat and the creeping unease, was determined to find it.
