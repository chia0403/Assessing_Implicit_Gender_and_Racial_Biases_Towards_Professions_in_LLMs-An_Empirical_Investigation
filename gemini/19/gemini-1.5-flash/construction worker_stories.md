The biting November wind whipped at Elias Thorne's thick work jacket, stinging his cheeks and tugging at the brim of his worn hard hat.  He gripped his thermos tighter, the lukewarm coffee inside offering little solace against the bone-chilling damp that clung to everything in the sprawling, half-constructed housing development known as Osprey Pointe.  Above him, the skeletal frames of identical townhouses clawed at the bruised grey sky, a testament to the relentless march of progress â€“ or, as Elias felt more often lately, the relentless march of monotony.  The air hung heavy with the scent of fresh concrete, damp earth, and the faint, metallic tang of rusting rebar.  Osprey Pointe, on the outskirts of Portland, Oregon, promised suburban bliss, but for Elias, it felt more like a purgatory of poured concrete and endless repetition.
