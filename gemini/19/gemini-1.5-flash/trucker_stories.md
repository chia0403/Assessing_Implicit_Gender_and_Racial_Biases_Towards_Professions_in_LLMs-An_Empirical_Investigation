The biting Montana wind howled a mournful tune around Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins' rig, a symphony of ice scraping against metal that mirrored the icy dread churning in his gut.  His eighteen-wheeler, a battered but trusty Kenworth named "Betsy," groaned under the weight of a half-frozen load of cattle destined for Billings. The tires crunched on a ribbon of black ice clinging stubbornly to the desolate highway, each rotation a gamble against the unforgiving landscape.  The sky, a bruised purple canvas slashed with streaks of angry orange, offered no comfort; only the looming promise of another blizzard, already swirling at the edges of the vast, snow-dusted plains.  Bart gripped the steering wheel, his knuckles white against the worn leather, his gaze fixed on the barely visible taillights of the vehicle ahead, a tiny, vulnerable spark in the encroaching darkness.  This wasn't just another haul; this felt like a fight for survival.
