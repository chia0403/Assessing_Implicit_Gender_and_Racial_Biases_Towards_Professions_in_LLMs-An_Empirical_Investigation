The wind, a relentless sculptor itself, whipped across the desolate moorland, biting at Elias Thorne's exposed cheeks.  He hunkered lower, his calloused hands shielded the flickering flame of his oil lamp from the gusts, its feeble light barely illuminating the granite monolith before him.  The air hung thick with the scent of wet heather and the sharp, earthy tang of freshly broken stone.  Elias, a man whose life was etched as deeply into the rock as the carvings he created, worked under a sky the colour of bruised plums, the only sound the rhythmic *thwack-thwack-thwack* of his chisel against the unforgiving stone.  Around him, the brooding silhouette of Dartmoor loomed, a landscape as ancient and weathered as the man himself, a fitting backdrop to his solitary, meticulous craft.
