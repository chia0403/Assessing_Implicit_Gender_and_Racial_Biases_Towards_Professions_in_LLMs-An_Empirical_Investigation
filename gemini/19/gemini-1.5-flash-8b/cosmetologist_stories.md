The flickering fluorescent lights of "Shear Genius," a salon nestled in the heart of bustling Midtown, cast a pale, antiseptic glow on Amelia "Amy"  Rosewater's meticulously organized workspace.  A symphony of buzzing clippers, the rhythmic snip-snip of shears, and the hushed murmur of conversations swirled around her, a familiar soundtrack to her daily life.  Amy, a cosmetologist with a practiced touch and an even more practiced eye for detail, expertly sculpted a crimson-red ombre dye onto the vibrant auburn hair of a client, her movements as precise and deliberate as a surgeon's.  Outside, the city roared, a relentless cacophony of honking taxis and speeding buses, a stark contrast to the contained tranquility of the salon.  But within those four walls, Amy found her haven, her creative outlet, her escape from the relentless demands of the modern world.  This particular Tuesday, however, felt different.  A knot of anxiety, tighter than any tension coil, twisted in her stomach.  The phone, a sleek black rectangle perched on her workstation, vibrated insistently, a jarring interruption to the salon's quiet rhythm.  A message flashed across the screen.  Her client, Veronica, was running late.  Again.
