The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual milky beige from years of dissolving sugar and cocoa, reflected the flickering fluorescent lights of "Sweet Surrender," casting a pale glow on Amelia Nightingale’s meticulously sculpted buttercream roses.  Her hands, nimble and stained a delicate shade of burnt caramel, moved with practiced grace.  Today's challenge: a towering, edible replica of the Eiffel Tower, complete with miniature champagne flutes and painstakingly detailed Parisian street lamps.

The tiny bakery, crammed into a historic corner building in the heart of the fading, but undeniably charming, district of Belleville, hummed with a symphony of clattering tins, the soft sigh of icing pipes, and the low murmur of conversations.

Amelia, a wisp of a woman with eyes that held the sparkle of a thousand sugared almonds, was surrounded by the familiar smells of vanilla, cinnamon, and freshly brewed coffee.  A constant rhythm of rhythmic knife strikes and whirring mixers formed a soothing soundtrack to her daily ritual.  Outside, the city pulsed with a life she rarely saw.  Belleville was a hushed, hidden world, a secret garden tucked between the clamor of the wider city.  Today, however, that hidden world was about to be shaken.
