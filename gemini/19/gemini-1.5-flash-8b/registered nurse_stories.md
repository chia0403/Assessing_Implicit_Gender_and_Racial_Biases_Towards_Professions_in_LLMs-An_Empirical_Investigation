The sterile white of the hospital hallway seemed to swallow Amelia Blackwood, RN, whole.  The fluorescent lights buzzed, a relentless drone that echoed the frantic rhythm of her own heartbeat.  Outside, the city thrummed with a life she felt increasingly disconnected from.  She adjusted the worn leather strap of her tote bag, the familiar weight a comforting ballast against the tempest brewing within.  Today's patient, a frail elderly woman named Mrs. Eleanor Vance, was proving particularly resistant to the prescribed protocol.  The antiseptic scent of the hospital hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the lingering, faint aroma of lilies that clung to the folds of Mrs. Vance's floral nightie.

Amelia, a registered nurse with five years' experience at St. Jude's General, found herself staring at the closed door of room 307, the digital clock on the wall mockingly counting down the seconds until her shift ended. The hallway was eerily quiet, punctuated only by the occasional clatter of medical equipment and the soft, almost imperceptible whimpers coming from within.  This wasn't a typical day at St. Jude's.  A strange stillness had settled over the usually bustling ward, a premonition of something amiss.  A sense of unease, thick as the hospital's antiseptic, had become an unwelcome companion.  Each footstep on the linoleum felt heavy, each breath a conscious effort.
