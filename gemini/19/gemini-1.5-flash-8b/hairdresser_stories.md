The chipped porcelain sink, stained a faded rose, reflected the flickering neon sign outside.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of "Scissors & Smiles," a salon barely clinging to existence on the edge of the city's forgotten district.  Inside, amidst the faint scent of lavender and old hairspray, Amelia Nightingale, a woman with eyes the colour of a stormy sea, meticulously snipped a strand of auburn hair.  The rhythmic snip, snip, snip echoed the frantic beat of her own heart, a frantic rhythm she'd learned to control over the past twenty years.  She was a creature of routine, and routine was her lifeblood.


Amelia, 42,  had been a hairdresser since she was eighteen.  Her salon, crammed into a small, windowless space that had once been a butcher's shop, had become her sanctuary.  Each day, each client, a fleeting glimpse into a world beyond her own.  A world she increasingly longed to escape, a world she kept at arm's length.  The alleyways outside, lined with overflowing bins and shadowed doorways, held stories she preferred not to hear, and the rough-hewn brick walls of the building itself seemed to murmur secrets of lives lived, and lost. The unspoken promises of a life she could never have were written on the backs of the faded posters lining the salon walls.  This particular rainy Tuesday felt strangely heavy, the silence amplified by the ceaseless patter against the metal.  And in that silence, Amelia heard a soft cough, a sound that broke the thread of her carefully constructed routine.
