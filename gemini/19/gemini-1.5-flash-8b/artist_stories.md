The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's charcoal-smudged hair across her face as she hunched deeper into the rickety wooden chair.  Rain, relentless and grey, hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the derelict workshop.  Sunlight, fractured and weak, struggled to pierce the gloom, illuminating only the swirling patterns of colour on the canvas spread before her.  This was the heart of the forgotten district, the "Gutter Gulch" of Havenwood, a place where time seemed to hang heavy and the echoes of forgotten dreams lingered in the damp air.  Amelia, a young artist with eyes the colour of stormy seas and hands that moved with a practiced grace, was lost in the creation of a new masterpiece â€“ a portrait of the Gulch's dilapidated majesty, a place of broken brick and twisted metal, where hope seemed as fragile as a spider's thread.  The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and something indefinably melancholic, a scent that echoed the melancholy in her own heart.
