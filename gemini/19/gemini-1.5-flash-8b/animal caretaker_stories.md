The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's coat around her legs as she hurried across the desolate expanse of the Blackwood Preserve.  Twisted, skeletal branches clawed at a bruised, pewter sky, the only sound the mournful howl of a lone wolf echoing through the gathering gloom.  Snow, the consistency of coarse grit, crunched under her boots as she navigated the treacherous path, her breath puffing out in white clouds.  The Preserve, once a vibrant tapestry of emerald forests and sapphire streams, was now a stark, wintry canvas painted with the grey tones of despair.  Amelia, Animal Caretaker of the Blackwood Preserve, knew this was no ordinary storm. This was a foreshadowing.  A silent, chilling harbinger of something far more sinister than the howling wind.

The Preserve, once a sprawling estate of Victorian grandeur, now housed a collection of exotic creatures salvaged from the brink of extinction:  a melancholic Bengal tiger named Rajah, a mischievous family of snow leopards, a colony of rescued otters, and a flock of endangered Andean condors.  Amelia, though barely twenty-five, carried the weight of this responsibility as if it were centuries old, each creature a fragile link to a world that was fading fast.  The staff building, nestled amongst the ancient oaks, was a testament to her dedication; a warm hearth against the encroaching darkness. Tonight, though, even the fire seemed to flicker with unease.
