The fluorescent hum of the pharmacy, a relentless, almost hypnotic thrum, was the soundtrack to Elara Nightingale’s life.  Dust motes danced in the pale light filtering through the grimy windowpanes of "Apothecary's Bloom," a name that felt more like a faded, wilting flower than a vibrant business.  Rain lashed against the glass, mimicking the ceaseless pounding of Elara’s thoughts.  She was staring at a bottle of calming syrup, its label depicting a serene, impossibly unrealistic landscape of lavender fields and whispering windmills.  A cruel irony, she thought, considering the turmoil swirling inside her.  Elara Nightingale, 29, pharmacist and reluctant observer of human suffering, knew the calming syrup held no magic.  It was merely sugar and a few scientifically-precise herbs, a pale imitation of peace.

The apothecary, tucked away on a quiet side street in the heart of the crumbling city of Veridia, seemed to hold its breath, a silent, grey testament to the era of industrial might now fading into forgotten grandeur.  Cobblestones, worn smooth by centuries of footsteps, echoed with the patter of the rain.  Above, the skeletal fingers of ancient, ivy-covered buildings clawed at the overcast sky.  The scent of damp earth and old paper hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint aroma of lavender and peppermint that hung from shelves filled with forgotten remedies and gleaming glass jars.  Dust motes danced and swirled in the low, filtered light.  Outside, Veridia's downtrodden populace hurried by, their faces etched with a weariness that mirrored the city itself.
