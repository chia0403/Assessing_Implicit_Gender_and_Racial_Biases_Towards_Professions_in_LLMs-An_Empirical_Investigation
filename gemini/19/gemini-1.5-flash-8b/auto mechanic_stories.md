The greasy air hung thick and cloying, a suffocating blanket woven from the scent of burnt oil, rubber, and something vaguely floral that clung to the chipped paint of the waiting room furniture.  Rain hammered against the corrugated metal roof of "Rusty Wrench," a tiny auto repair shop tucked away on a side street in the perpetually overcast city of Aethelgard.  Inside, Elias Thorne, a lanky auto mechanic with hands calloused but surprisingly gentle, meticulously adjusted a delicate valve on a vintage motorcycle engine.  Sunlight, fractured and weak, filtered through the grimy windowpanes, illuminating dust motes dancing in the humid air. The shop's clock, a battered metal monstrosity, ticked away the minutes with a relentless metronome-like rhythm, each tick echoing the rhythmic whirring of the engine Elias worked on.  The rhythmic click of the screwdriver against the metal was the only sound that filled the space, except for the occasional rumble of a passing truck.  A single, threadbare armchair sat in the corner, its floral fabric faded to a ghostly white. A customer, a weathered woman with eyes that held the weariness of a thousand long journeys, sat patiently, her gaze fixed on the intricate workings before her.
