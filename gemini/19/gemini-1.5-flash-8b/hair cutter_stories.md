The chipped porcelain sink, stained a dull, perpetual beige, reflected the flickering fluorescent light of "Scissors & Smiles," casting long, distorted shadows across the cramped salon.  Dust motes danced in the air, illuminated by the single bare bulb hanging precariously from the ceiling.  Amelia "Em"  Featherstone, a petite woman with a perpetually anxious energy, snipped at a stubborn strand of auburn hair, the rhythmic *snip snip* a counterpoint to the muted hum of the neighborhood outside.  Her fingers, nimble and precise despite the constant tremor, moved with the practiced grace of a seasoned artist.  Today, however, the art felt more like a mechanical dance, a routine performed in a space that was slowly suffocating her.  

The salon, nestled between a used bookstore and a bakery that smelled suspiciously of burnt sugar, had been Em's sanctuary for the past ten years.  She'd inherited the small business from her grandmother, a legendary hair stylist in the 1970s, but the vibrant, bustling salon of old had withered into a quiet, almost forgotten corner of the city.  The clientele, once a loyal mix of housewives and students, had dwindled to a handful of regulars, their conversations now the only sound besides the rhythmic buzz of Em's clippers.  The once cheerful, pastel-painted walls were now muted, the faded paint hinting at a slow, painful decay.  It was a space that felt both familiar and foreign, a comfort and a cage.
