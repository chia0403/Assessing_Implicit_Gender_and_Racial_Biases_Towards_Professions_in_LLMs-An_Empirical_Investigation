The flickering neon sign of the "Golden Gauntlet" bar cast a sickly yellow glow across the rain-slicked alleyway.  Water, the consistency of thick syrup, pooled around Amelia "Sparky"  Fitzwilliam's boots as she navigated the treacherous path.  The air, thick with the smell of stale beer and something vaguely floral, clung to her like a damp shroud.  Sparky, a seasoned electrician with calloused hands and eyes that held the fire of a thousand volts, cursed under her breath.  Another night, another dodgy connection, another bar owner clinging to the past while their establishment stubbornly refused to embrace the modern age.

The Golden Gauntlet, a relic of a bygone era, stood defiant against the rising tide of gentrification.  Brickwork, worn smooth by decades of spilled drinks and whispered secrets, was stained with the ghost of spilled paint and cheap cologne. Inside, the air was a suffocating mix of smoky haze and the metallic tang of old copper wiring.   The scent of ozone hung heavy in the alley, a potent reminder of Sparky's profession.  The rhythmic thump of her heavy boots on the cobblestones, echoing through the narrow passageway, was the only sound that could break the oppressive quiet of the night.
