The biting wind, a relentless claw of ice, whipped across the jagged peaks of the Veridian Mountains.  Dust, kicked up from the glacial scree, stung Elara Stonehand's eyes as she surveyed the quarry.  Grey-veined granite, sculpted by millennia of frost and fire, lay scattered like fallen giants.  Her name, whispered on the wind, was a testament to her calling.  Elara Stonehand, daughter of the mountain, and now, its unwilling inheritor.

The quarry, a scar etched into the heart of the Veridian range, echoed with the rhythmic clang of her hammer against the stone.  Sunlight, a fleeting visitor in these altitudes, struggled to pierce the swirling mists, casting long, dancing shadows that mimicked the phantoms of forgotten carvings.  For centuries, generations of stone cutters had toiled here, their lives inextricably bound to the raw, unyielding heart of the mountain.  The air, thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, held the whispers of a thousand chisel strikes.  Within this glacial fortress, where the cold seeped into the very marrow, lay the heart of the kingdom's sculptural legacy.
