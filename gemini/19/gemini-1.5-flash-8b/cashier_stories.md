The fluorescent lights of the "Bargain Bin Blitz" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Blackwood's life.  The air, thick with the scent of stale coffee and slightly sour potato chips, hung heavy in the small, cramped store.  Rows of discarded merchandise – dented tins, cracked mugs, and mismatched socks – stretched out like a dusty, chaotic battlefield.  Amelia, a twenty-seven-year-old with eyes the color of faded amethyst, stood behind the counter, her hands stained a faded, familiar shade of burnt orange from the endless stream of discounted goods.  The worn plastic apron, a faded robin's egg blue, felt like a second skin. Today, however, the usual cacophony of rustling bags and impatient shoppers was absent. An unnerving quiet hung in the air, broken only by the rhythmic click-clack of Amelia's keyboard.  The quiet was both unsettling and strangely compelling.  It was the quiet before the storm.
