The rhythmic *click* of Dr. Alistair Finch's adjusting table echoed through the quiet, almost cavernous, space of Finch Family Chiropractic.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the window, illuminating a half-eaten bowl of granola and a discarded copy of "The Complete Guide to Spinal Decompression" on the cluttered desk.  Alistair, a man whose broad shoulders and perpetually furrowed brow spoke of both relentless physicality and intellectual intensity, hunched over a patient file, his brow drawn even tighter.  The office, a sun-drenched oasis of worn-leather furniture and the faint scent of pine, had the quiet efficiency of a well-oiled machine, except for this one, persistent hum of something unresolved.  Outside, the vibrant hubbub of the city – honking taxis, chattering crowds – was a muffled roar, a stark contrast to the contemplative stillness within.  Alistair’s world was a symphony of bone-on-bone, a precise dance of adjustment and relief, but something felt…off.  This particular file, that of a young woman named Clara, just didn’t seem to fit the pattern.
