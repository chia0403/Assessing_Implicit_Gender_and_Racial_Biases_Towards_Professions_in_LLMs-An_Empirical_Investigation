The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Amy” Hawthorne's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks as she navigated the narrow cobblestone streets of the historic district.  Sunlight, weak and filtered through a canopy of ancient oak trees, cast long shadows across the weathered brick buildings.  Amy, a seasoned real estate agent with a polished smile and even more polished shoes, adjusted her worn leather satchel. This wasn't your typical suburban listing; this was the heart of Old Oakhaven, a town where the past clung to the present like ivy to a crumbling wall.  Rumors swirled around these houses like autumn leaves, whispers of forgotten fortunes and family secrets tucked away in attic trunks and hidden behind antique wallpaper. Amy’s current listing, the Blackwood Manor, was a perfect storm of these rumors.  It had been vacant for over a decade, a silent sentinel gazing out at the town square, and the locals had their theories on why.  This wasn’t just about selling a house; this was about uncovering the history buried beneath the meticulously preserved facade.  Her mission: to unravel the Blackwood mystery and find the right buyer for a property that was more than bricks and mortar.
