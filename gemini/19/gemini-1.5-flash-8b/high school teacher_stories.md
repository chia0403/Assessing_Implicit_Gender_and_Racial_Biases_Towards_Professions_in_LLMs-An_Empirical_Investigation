Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Ms. Eleanor Vance's classroom, a rhythmic percussion that mirrored the frantic drumming in her chest.  The air hung thick with the scent of mildew and stale coffee, a familiar aroma that clung to the small, cramped room like a shroud.  Eleventh-grade English, Tuesdays.  Always Tuesdays.  This Tuesday, however, felt different.  A chill deeper than the relentless downpour seeped into the very bones of the room, an unsettling anticipation that had nothing to do with the approaching winter solstice and everything to do with the mysterious package that lay on her desk, wrapped in plain brown paper and sealed with faded crimson wax.

The classroom itself was a testament to the worn-out charm of Oakhaven High, a school nestled in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains, where time seemed to move at a glacial pace.  Sunlight, when it dared to pierce the perpetual cloud cover, filtered through the dusty windows, painting the chipped paint a muted, gray-green.  The chipped Formica tables, scarred with countless student doodles, seemed to whisper tales of whispered secrets and clandestine conversations.  Books, dog-eared and overflowing with highlights and annotations, leaned precariously against the walls, their paperbacks bulging with the stories they held.  The smell of ozone, from the nearby power station, often mixed with the dampness. The entire school felt steeped in a quiet melancholy, a melancholia that Ms. Vance, despite her passion for literature, had often found hard to shake.
