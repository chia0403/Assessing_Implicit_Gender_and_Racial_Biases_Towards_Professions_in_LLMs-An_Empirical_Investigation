The premiere of "Echoes of the Past," her fourth feature film, a labour of love – and a painful, soul-crushing one at that. The meticulously crafted narrative, the cast she'd nurtured, the beautiful cinematography that almost whispered the story – all threatened to unravel under the weight of her own self-doubt.
