The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual beige by years of lukewarm water and forgotten soap, reflected the flickering gaslight above.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom of the Grand Magnolia Hotel's cavernous lobby.  Barnaby "Barty" Butterfield, bellhop extraordinaire, or at least that's what he told himself, sighed. Another slow Tuesday night.  The only sound besides the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner was the rhythmic thump-thump of his own weary heart against his ribs.  He wiped a streak of grime from a brass tray, the movement almost automatic.  The hotel, usually a symphony of arriving and departing carriages, of hurried footsteps and boisterous laughter, was eerily quiet.

The Grand Magnolia, a faded Victorian monstrosity perched precariously on a hill overlooking the sprawling metropolis of Ashwood, had seen better days.  Ornate, once-vibrant carvings on the banister now bore the scars of countless forgotten dreams.  Dust bunnies clung to the plush velvet curtains, and the grand staircase, once a spectacle of elegance, now whispered of lost grandeur.  A perpetual chill clung to the air, a stark contrast to the humid summer night outside.  The only warm spots were the occasional flickering lamps and the faint heat radiating from the fireplace in the adjacent drawing room, its flames a meager beacon in the suffocating darkness.  Barnaby knew better than to linger near the fireplace. It attracted the worst kind of guests, the gossiping ones and the ones with secrets.
