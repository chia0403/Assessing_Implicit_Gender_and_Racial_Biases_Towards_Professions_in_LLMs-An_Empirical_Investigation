The fluorescent lights of Dr. Anya Sharma's office hummed, a constant, almost imperceptible thrum that resonated with the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Amelia Petrova's ultrasonic scaler.  Amelia, a dental hygienist with a name that felt as smooth and polished as the porcelain she so often worked on, leaned over the patient's chair, her gloved hands hovering over the surface of a surprisingly resistant set of molars.  The scent of antiseptic mingled with the faint aroma of coffee from a nearby cafe, a scent that always seemed to cling to the waiting room like a lingering aftertaste.

The office, located in a quiet corner of the bustling city of Oakhaven, was a study in muted grays and calming greens.  Sunlight, filtered through the tall windows, dappled the polished floors, creating intricate patterns of light and shadow on the gleaming metal instruments lining the stainless steel sinks.  The room, though functional and sterile, held a quiet hum of activity, the soft murmurs of conversations and the occasional sharp "tsk" from a patient, each a small piece of the city's daily symphony.  This particular Tuesday morning was no exception, yet Amelia felt a distinct unease settling over her.  It wasn't the usual pre-lunch jitters; it was something deeper, something...waiting.
