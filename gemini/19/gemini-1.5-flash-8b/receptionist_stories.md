The fluorescent lights of the "Apex Solutions" office hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Amelia Blackwood's fingers on the keyboard.  The air, thick with the scent of stale coffee and cheap printer toner, hung heavy in the small, windowless reception area.  Rows of identical beige cubicles stretched into the hazy distance, swallowed by the muted gray of the late afternoon.  Amelia, a petite woman with perpetually tired eyes and a cascade of auburn hair pulled back in a tight bun, stared at the blinking cursor on her screen.  Another Tuesday.  Another barrage of calls about "Project Chimera" â€“ a project shrouded in corporate secrecy that had consumed Amelia's existence for the past three months.  Even the cheerful greeting cards celebrating the company's "Third Quarter Triumph" felt hollow, like forced smiles plastered on a wilting bouquet.
