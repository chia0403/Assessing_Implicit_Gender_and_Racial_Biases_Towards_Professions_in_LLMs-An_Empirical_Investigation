Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the "Healing Haven" clinic, a rhythmic counterpoint to the rhythmic clicking of Amelia Stone's fingers as she expertly manipulated a patient's hand.  Amelia, Occupational Therapist extraordinaire, stood in the small, cramped physiotherapy room, the air thick with the scent of antiseptic and damp earth.  Sunlight, struggling to pierce the dense canopy of trees outside, cast long, shifting shadows across the room.  Healing Haven, nestled deep within the emerald heart of the Ashwood Forest, was a surprising juxtaposition of rustic charm and modern therapy techniques.  Wooden tables, handcrafted by local artisans, supported a variety of therapeutic equipment â€“ colourful exercise balls, weighted blankets, and intricate puzzles.  The overall feel was one of warm, earthy tones, but it held a subtle tension, a sense of both quietude and urgency.  Today, as she worked with a weathered farmer named Thomas, Amelia felt that familiar tug of responsibility, a calling that extended beyond the confines of the clinic walls and into the very fabric of Ashwood.
