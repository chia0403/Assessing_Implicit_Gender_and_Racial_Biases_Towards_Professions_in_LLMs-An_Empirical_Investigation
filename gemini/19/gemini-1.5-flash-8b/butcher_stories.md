The scent of blood, sharp and metallic, clung to the air like a shroud.  Barnaby "Barnacle" Bartholomew, his face smeared with a glistening crimson that stubbornly refused to be washed away, wiped a hand across his brow.  The clang of the cleaver against the steel, the guttural grunts of the struggling beast, the rhythmic thud of his own heart—all mingled into a symphony of slaughter that was, for Barnacle, music.  The flickering gaslight of "The Butcher's Block," his small, butchershop in the shadowed alleys of Old Southwark, cast long, dancing shadows across the butchered carcass of a boar.  He was a master of his domain, a sculptor of meat, a craftsman of death, and the only one who dared tread the night within these hallowed—and rather gruesome—halls.  The year was 1888.
