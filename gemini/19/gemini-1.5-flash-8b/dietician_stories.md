The aroma of roasted beetroot, surprisingly potent despite the antiseptic cleanliness of the clinic, hung heavy in the air.  Dr. Amelia Petrova, meticulously arranging a plate of colourful, if slightly intimidating, vegetables, sighed. Another appointment with a patient convinced their restrictive diet was the key to their anxieties, rather than the root cause.  This was her seventh such appointment today.  Her neatly pressed, charcoal grey trousers felt like lead weights dragging her down.  Outside, the relentless drizzle of the London Autumn seemed to mirror the dampness clinging to her own spirit.

The clinic, "Nourish & Thrive," was a small, unassuming building nestled amongst the towering, grey office blocks of the City of London.  Sunlight struggled to penetrate the thick glass panes, casting a muted, almost melancholic light over the minimalist waiting room.  Barely visible through the frosted glass door, a row of framed certificates, each showcasing a different dietary achievement, lined the entrance. A faint, persistent hum of muted conversation and the rhythmic *click* of computer keys filled the sterile air.  Amelia hated the sterility, the relentless pursuit of perfection, the very idea that food could be reduced to a series of meticulously measured macros. It feltâ€¦wrong.  Today, that feeling was amplified tenfold.
