The fluorescent hum of the lab vibrated through Amelia Nightingale's bones, a low, insistent thrum that mirrored the pulse she was tracking with her gloved fingers.  The sterile white walls of the Eastside Community Clinic pressed in on her, a stark contrast to the vibrant tapestry of the city that sprawled outside the towering windows.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun, painting the grime-streaked glass with fleeting patterns of light and shadow.  Amelia, a phlebotomist for the past three years, knew this routine by heart: the antiseptic scent of iodine, the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the heart monitor, the hushed whispers of concerned patients.  Today, though, the usual quiet hum of the clinic felt strained, laced with an underlying tension that prickled the back of her neck.  She was preparing for the afternoon influx of patients, a constant stream of people seeking comfort, or relief, or answers in the sterile sanctuary of the clinic.  But today, something felt different.  A tremor, almost imperceptible, ran through the air, a sense of unease that settled in the pit of her stomach.
