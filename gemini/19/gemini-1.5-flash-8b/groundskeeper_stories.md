The chipped paint of the gazebo's railing, a faded shade of ochre, clung to the damp morning air.  Dew beaded on the meticulously manicured boxwood hedges, reflecting the pale sunlight filtering through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks that ringed the sprawling estate of Blackwood Manor.  Elias Blackwood, groundskeeper for the past twenty-three years, adjusted the strap of his worn leather satchel, the familiar weight of his tools a comforting counterpoint to the quiet anticipation that settled over him.  Today, Lady Seraphina Blackwood was returning from her European sojourn, and the estate, usually hushed and slumbering under the weight of its own grandeur, was stirring with a palpable sense of expectation.  The meticulous hedges, the perfect lawns, the ancient oaks that had witnessed countless seasonsâ€”all were now meticulously polished, meticulously prepared, for her return. Elias, whose true name was Elias Thorne but who, like the grounds he tended, had long been a part of the Blackwood tapestry, stood, his broad shoulders and weathered hands hinting at the relentless, patient work that had kept him rooted to this land.  The air hummed with a low, almost imperceptible buzz of activity, the soft thud of a rake, the distant murmur of distant gardeners, all preparing for the arrival of the lady of the manor.
