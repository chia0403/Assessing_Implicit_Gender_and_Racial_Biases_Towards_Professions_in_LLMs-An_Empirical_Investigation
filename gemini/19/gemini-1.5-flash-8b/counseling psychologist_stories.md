Sunlight, fractured by the relentless downpour, barely pierced the gloom, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air.  Eleanor, her name etched into the weary facade of the building as if it were a testament to the weight of its history, sighed.  Another Monday. Another storm. Another soul needing solace in this forgotten corner of the city.
