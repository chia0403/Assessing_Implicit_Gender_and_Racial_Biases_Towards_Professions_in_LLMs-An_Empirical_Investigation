The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwoodâ€™s tweed coat around her legs, stinging her cheeks with icy needles.  The skeletal branches of the ancient oaks, draped in a skeletal shroud of frost, clawed at the pale winter sky.  Below, the village of Oakhaven nestled in a hollow, its few flickering lights like scattered embers against the monochrome landscape.  Amelia, Dr. Amelia Blackwood, veterinarian, felt the familiar chill that always settled deep within her bones when she ventured out on these late-night calls.  Tonight, the call had come from the isolated farmstead of Farmer Giles, a man known for his stubborn resilience and even more stubborn livestock.  And, tonight, something was very, very wrong.

The setting was the rural Yorkshire countryside of England, somewhere in the late 19th century, a time of horse-drawn carts and flickering gaslight. The biting frost and vast expanse of the winter landscape underscored the isolation of the farmstead and the challenges Amelia Blackwood faced in her profession, especially in the inhospitable conditions of the region.
