The flickering neon sign of the "Rusty Mug" cast a lurid, orange glow across the rain-slicked cobblestones of Oldtown.  Whispers of wind howled through the narrow alleyways, carrying with them the scent of roasting chestnuts and something else, something acrid and metallic, like old blood.  Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of stale beer and desperation.  This was Amelia Nightingale's stage.  Not the grand, ornate concert halls she dreamed of, but this smoky, backwater dive where a single, cracked spotlight was the only witness to her voice.


Amelia Nightingale, a wisp of a girl with eyes the color of storm clouds and hair like raven's wings, perched precariously on a stool at the edge of the stage.  Her worn, leather-bound guitar lay across her lap, a familiar comfort in this unfamiliar setting. The music pouring from the battered jukebox, a discordant blend of blues and folk, served as a soundtrack to her anxieties. Tonight, the crowd was sparse, a handful of hardened patrons nursing their drinks and watching with a mixture of boredom and indifference. Tonight's melody was her own composition, a fragile ballad penned in the harsh, echoing silence of her past.
