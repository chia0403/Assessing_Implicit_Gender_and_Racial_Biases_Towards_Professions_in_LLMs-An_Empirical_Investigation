The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the chipped linoleum floor of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's barbershop, "The Clipper's Cut."  Dust motes, illuminated like tiny, spectral butterflies, swirled in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom of the back alley.  A faint aroma of sandalwood and something vaguely metallic clung to the air, a scent that Barty, with his practiced nose, knew signaled a particularly troubled afternoon.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless percussion that echoed the rhythmic snip-snip of his clippers.  Barty, a man weathered by countless whispered confidences and the weight of years, was hunched over his station, his calloused hands expertly maneuvering a razor across the jawline of a man whose face bore the etching of countless nights spent under the city's indifferent gaze.  Tonight, the man's story felt particularly heavy.  The street outside, a symphony of drunken shouts and the clatter of hurrying feet, was a constant backdrop to the quiet ritual of the barbershop.
