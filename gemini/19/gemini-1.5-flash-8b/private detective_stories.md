The chipped paint of the alleyway, a faded, bruised purple, seemed to absorb the meager light filtering down from the grimy sky.  Rain, a relentless, icy curtain, hammered against the rusted metal awning of "The Rusty Mug," a dive bar that had seen better days, and smelled worse.  Detective Alistair Finch, a man whose trench coat was as perpetually damp as his spirits, crouched low, his gaze fixed on a discarded, blood-stained handkerchief.  The scent of antiseptic, acrid and cloying, hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the stale beer and despair that usually clung to this forgotten corner of the city.  Alistair, his face etched with lines that spoke volumes of sleepless nights and grim cases, traced the faded pattern on the handkerchief with a calloused finger.  This was the scene, this was the beginning.

The setting:  The impoverished, rain-lashed district known as the Underbelly of Oakhaven.  Narrow, twisting streets, choked by towering, decaying warehouses and crumbling tenements, formed a labyrinth of shadows.  The Underbelly, a place where whispers echoed louder than shouts and secrets were carved into the very stones, was Alistair Finch's professional domain.  It was a place where hope was as rare as a clear night and where the line between justice and despair blurred into a murky grey.
