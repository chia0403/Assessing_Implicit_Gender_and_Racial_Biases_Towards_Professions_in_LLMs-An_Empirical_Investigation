The flickering fluorescent lights of the Zenith Academy hummed a mournful dirge, casting long, skeletal shadows across the polished marble floors.  Dust motes, illuminated like tiny, spectral dancers, swirled in the stagnant air.  Elias Thorne, custodian and silent observer of Zenith's hallowed halls, meticulously scrubbed a grime-encrusted tile near the ancient oak doors of the Principal's office.  He'd been doing this for fifteen years, a silent guardian of the whispers and secrets held within the prestigious academy.  The rhythmic squeak of his mop was the only sound in the deserted corridors.  The school year had ended, and the air hung thick with the lingering scent of chalk dust and impending summer.


The setting is Zenith Academy, a prestigious, centuries-old boarding school nestled within the rolling hills of the Vermont countryside.  Its grand, Gothic architecture, stark white against the verdant backdrop, housed generations of students, their dreams and triumphs, their anxieties and failures, all etched into the very stone and wood of the building.  The hallways echoed with the ghostly remnants of laughter and lessons, whispers of forgotten rivalries, and the hushed reverence of important pronouncements.  Today, however, only Elias, and the ghosts, remained.
