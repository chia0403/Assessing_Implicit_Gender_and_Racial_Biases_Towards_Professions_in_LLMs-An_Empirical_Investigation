The fluorescent lights of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office hummed, a relentless counterpoint to the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the hallway.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grime-coated windowpanes, illuminating a swirling vortex of papers and half-empty coffee cups on her mahogany desk.  Eleanor, a clinical psychologist with a practiced weariness etched onto her face, stared at the latest case file, its cover – a faded photograph of a young woman with eyes that seemed to hold a universe of unspoken sorrow – pressed against the cool glass of her desk.  The patient,  Amelia "Amy"  Carter, was a newcomer to her practice,  a recent transplant from a small town nestled deep within the Appalachian Mountains.   The file itself felt heavy, weighted down by whispers of isolation, unspoken traumas, and a deep-seated fear that clung to the pages like a spectral fog.  The case file opened with a single sentence: "She feels trapped in a cage she can’t see." The setting:  A quiet, albeit slightly seedy, corner office in a sprawling, aging two-story building on the edge of a once-bustling downtown district. Now, a mix of forgotten grandeur and bustling modern life, the city pulse barely registered here. A sense of stagnation hung in the air, a stark contrast to the turbulent internal world Eleanor was about to delve into.
