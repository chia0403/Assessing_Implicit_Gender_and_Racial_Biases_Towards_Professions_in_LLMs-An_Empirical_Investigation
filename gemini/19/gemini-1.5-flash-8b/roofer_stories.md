Below, the sprawling estate stretched out, a labyrinth of overgrown gardens and shadowed, empty rooms.  The wind whispered secrets through the broken gutters, tales of lost fortunes and even more lost love. Barty, though, was focused on the task at hand, a repair job that seemed to consume the very air around him.
