The biting wind whipped Amelia Grayson's crimson coat around her legs, stinging her exposed cheeks.  The flickering sodium lights of the deserted highway cast long, skeletal shadows across the snow-dusted landscape.  Below, the mangled remains of a pickup truck, twisted like a broken doll, spoke a silent, horrifying language.  Amelia, a paramedic with the Blackwood County Emergency Medical Services, knelt beside the crumpled metal, her gloved hands already assessing the scene.  The frigid air tasted of diesel and fear.  This wasn't the typical fender bender.  The mangled cab suggested a much more serious impact.  And the eerie stillness – the absence of the usual panicked cries – was far more unsettling. The lone, skeletal pine trees lining the desolate road seemed to watch, stoic and silent sentinels against the encroaching darkness.  Blackwood County, a sprawling expanse of frozen forests and whispering pines, was never more inhospitable.
