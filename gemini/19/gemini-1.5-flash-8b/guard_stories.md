Kael, a seasoned guard of the Order of the Ironclad, stood sentinel at the northernmost pass.  His breath fogged in the frigid air, painting ghostly white patterns in the already pale light of the nearing twilight.  The valley itself, a verdant emerald patch nestled between the towering peaks, seemed to shimmer with an almost unnatural glow, hinting at the magic that resided within.  His orders were simple, brutal, and unwavering: maintain the seal.  Anyone or anything entering or leaving without proper authorization would be met with force.  Kaelâ€™s duty was a burden, a solemn oath to protect the fragile balance of the world, a balance that felt increasingly precarious in these troubled times.
