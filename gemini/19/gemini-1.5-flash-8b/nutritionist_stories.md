The biting London wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks as she hurried down Regent's Park Road.  Early morning mist clung to the ancient oaks, their skeletal branches reaching like skeletal fingers towards the pale grey sky.  A lone robin, its breast a flash of crimson against the muted palette, chirped from a low-hanging branch.  Amelia, meticulously timing her steps to the rhythm of her own breath, adjusted her worn leather satchel.  She was late.  Again.  Not for the social whirl of trendy health food shops or high-profile celebrity consultations, but for something far more crucial: a routine home visit with a young family grappling with the aftermath of a serious illness.  

Amelia Blackwood, Registered Nutritional Therapist,  found a particular satisfaction in the quiet, often unsung work she performed.  She didn't deal in quick fixes or flashy results. Her practice was built on understanding the intricate dance between nourishment and wellbeing, on tailored plans woven from a deep knowledge of both the human body and the intricate tapestry of family life.  The scent of freshly brewed coffee, carried on the breeze, mingled with the damp earth, a comforting contrast to the chill of the London morning.   Her destination, a modest terraced house nestled amidst the leafy avenues, held a weight that surpassed mere lateness.  She knew their story, and she knew this visit was going to require more than just a balanced meal plan.
