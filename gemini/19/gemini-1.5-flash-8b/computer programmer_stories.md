The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Code Cave" hummed a monotonous symphony, mirroring the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Amelia Hayes's fingers on the keyboard.  Amelia, a 27-year-old computer programmer with eyes that held the deep pools of a midnight sky, was hunched over a screen that displayed lines of code blurring into an abstract landscape.  The air, thick with the smell of stale coffee and burnt popcorn, hung heavy in the cramped, repurposed warehouse space that served as both office and refuge for the small, scrappy tech startup, "Binary Bloom."  Empty pizza boxes littered the floor like fallen leaves in autumn, testament to the all-nighters and countless hours spent chasing algorithms and debugging glitches.  Outside, the city of Neo-Veridian thrummed with a life Amelia rarely experienced.  Inside the Code Cave, she was king, queen, and coder all rolled into one, lost in the intricate dance of ones and zeros.  Today, however, the dance was more frantic, more desperate.  A critical update for the newly released "Chronoscape" application was due, and a persistent error, a phantom bug lurking in the code, refused to yield.
