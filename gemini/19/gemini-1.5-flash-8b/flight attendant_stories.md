The humid air hung thick and sweet, a sickly perfume of jasmine and something vaguely metallic, clinging to the polished teak of the first-class cabin.  Rain hammered against the panoramic windows of the Boeing 787, blurring the neon-lit cityscape of Tokyo into a shimmering watercolour.  Amelia "Amy"  Carter, her name discreetly embroidered on her crisp uniform, meticulously arranged the silverware on a pristine tray.  The rhythmic hum of the plane, a constant lullaby of metal and machinery, was punctuated by the faint, almost imperceptible, clicking of high heels on the polished floor.  Amy pressed her lips together, a flicker of anticipation – and a touch of apprehension – dancing in her eyes.  This was it.  Flight 143, bound for London, and the start of a new chapter.

The setting:  The first-class cabin of a modern, long-haul jetliner, somewhere over the Pacific Ocean, just before dawn.  The ambiance is both luxurious and slightly claustrophobic. The exterior view, though fleeting through the rain-streaked windows, suggests a bustling, vibrant metropolis.  A subtle tension, like a coiled spring, permeates the air, amplified by the hushed conversations and the hushed anticipation of those aboard.
