The biting wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks, rattling the warped, weathered windowpanes of the Blackwood Clinic.  Dr.  Eleanor Vance shivered, not just from the chill seeping through the thick wool of her coat, but from the gnawing unease that had settled in her stomach like a lead weight.  It was a Tuesday in late October, the kind of day that whispered secrets through the skeletal branches of the ancient forest that bordered the small, isolated town of Willow Creek.

The clinic itself, a squat, grey stone building, seemed to absorb the encroaching darkness, its single, flickering gas lamp casting long, dancing shadows that stretched and contorted into grotesque shapes on the peeling paint.  Dust motes danced in the feeble light, swirling like tiny, spectral figures around the cluttered waiting room.  A lone, unidentifiable scent, a blend of damp earth and something faintly sweet, hung heavy in the air, a tangible presence that pressed against the suffocating stillness.  Eleanor knew this scent. It was the prelude to something unsettling, something...other.
