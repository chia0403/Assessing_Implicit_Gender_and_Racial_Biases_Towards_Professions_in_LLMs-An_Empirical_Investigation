Below, the lumber mill roared, a rhythmic symphony of steel and wood, a stark contrast to the desolate silence of the mountain.  Today, however, the millâ€™s sound was amplified, a frantic buzzing, a testament to the pressure of the looming winter and the need to stockpile wood for the long months ahead. Elias's task was clear, yet fraught with a quiet, familiar dread.
