The chipped paint of the "Little Lambs" daycare centre clung to the walls like faded memories.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the afternoon gloom, illuminating a swirling vortex of colourful crayons and half-finished drawings.  Ten-year-old Amelia "Milly" Cartwright, her name a whispered secret among the toddlers, stared at the chaotic scene.  It was Thursday, the day the older children, the ones who'd outgrown the giggles and naps, were allowed a little extra freedom, a short hour in the fenced-in play area behind the building.  Milly, officially a "child care worker," but more accurately, a guardian angel in training, surveyed her kingdom.  The air buzzed with the low hum of conversation, the rhythmic thump of bouncing balls, and the occasional, heartbreaking wail of a forgotten toy.  This was her sanctuary, her battlefield, her little universe, and today, it was hers to hold.
