The biting November wind whipped Amelia Nightingale's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks as she surveyed the sprawling, grey expanse of the Salisbury Plain.  Below, the ancient stones of Stonehenge, silhouetted against the bruised sky, seemed to hum with a silent, prehistoric energy.  It was a beautiful, and chilling, sight.  Amelia, a seasoned tour guide with a deep-seated love for history, felt the familiar thrill of anticipation.  Today's tour was different.  Today, her group included a man whose eyes held a flicker of something other than ordinary curiosity â€“ a flicker of something unsettling.

**Setting:**

The Salisbury Plain, Wiltshire, England, a vast, windswept expanse of chalk downland. The air hung heavy with the scent of earth and pine, punctuated by the distant cry of a crow.  The imposing stones of Stonehenge, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, stood sentinel against the bruised twilight sky.  A chill, November wind howled, carrying the whispers of centuries past.  Amelia's small, antique tour bus, a battered relic she affectionately called the "Time Traveler," sat parked near the prehistoric monument, its engine idling, a warm contrast to the frigid air.  Inside, the hushed anticipation of ten tourists mingled with the faint smell of wool and old parchment.
