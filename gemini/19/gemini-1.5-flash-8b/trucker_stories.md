The biting wind whipped at the oversized visor of  Jasper "Jax" Blackwood's cab, stinging his eyes and rattling the already precarious cargo of vintage record albums.  He squinted, focusing on the barely discernible road ahead, a ribbon of grey slicing through the endless, featureless expanse of the Dakotas.  The air, thick with the scent of pine and something akin to burnt sugar, clung to the rig like a second skin.  He was hours from the next town, and the only company for miles was the relentless howl of the wind and the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of his rig's engine, a familiar lullaby in its own way.

Setting:  The vast, sparsely populated plains of North Dakota, winter.  A desolate stretch of highway, miles from any civilization, under a leaden sky. The cab of Jax's 18-wheeler is a small, claustrophobic world, warmed by the engine's rumble, punctuated by the occasional crackle of the radio.
