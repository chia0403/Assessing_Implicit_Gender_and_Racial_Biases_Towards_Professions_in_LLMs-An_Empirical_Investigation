The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Numbers & Nuggets" accounting firm hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic clatter of Amelia Peabody's keyboard.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grime-coated window, illuminating the swirling patterns of paperwork scattered across her desk.  Amelia, a woman whose quiet efficiency was almost as formidable as her impressive filing system, meticulously entered a series of figures into the ledger, her brow furrowed in concentration.  The year was 1987, and the air in the small office, crammed with overflowing file cabinets and the faint smell of old coffee, felt thick with the weight of countless transactions.

The setting was a cramped, third-floor office in a nondescript building in downtown Cleveland.  The worn linoleum floors felt cold beneath Ameliaâ€™s feet, and the air conditioning, if it could be called that, offered little respite from the summer heat.  Beside her, the constant hum of the old, unreliable copy machine served as an almost tangible manifestation of the business's unspoken anxieties. Outside, the city buzzed with life; the clanging of streetcars, the cries of vendors, and the distant rumble of construction. But within the office, a quiet intensity reigned, a place where numbers whispered secrets and ledgers held the key to the city's economic pulse.
