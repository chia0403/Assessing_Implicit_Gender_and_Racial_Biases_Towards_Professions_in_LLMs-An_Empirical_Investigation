The chipped paint of the "Road Maintenance" sign, faded a sickly yellow-orange in the relentless Arizona sun, seemed to mock Silas Blackwood.  He wiped sweat from his brow, the gritty dust clinging like a second skin.  The endless expanse of the I-40 stretched before him, a ribbon of asphalt snaking through the ochre desert landscape.  Heat shimmered above the cracked pavement, distorting the already hazy horizon.  This was his third day fixing the same pothole, a festering wound that seemed to bleed tar and despair with every passing truck.  Silas felt the familiar ache in his back, a constant companion since his youth, a testament to the relentless toll of the sun and the unforgiving road.  He wasn't built for this.  He wasn't built for anything but quiet solitude, the kind only the vast, unforgiving beauty of the desert could offer.  But fate, or perhaps the unforgiving highway itself, had other plans.
