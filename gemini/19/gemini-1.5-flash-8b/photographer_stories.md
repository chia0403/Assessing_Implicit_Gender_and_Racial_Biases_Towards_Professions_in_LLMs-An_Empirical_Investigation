The biting wind whipped Amelia Nightingale's camera bag around her, stinging her cheeks with icy rain.  Grey skies, heavy and low, mirrored the gloom settling over the abandoned pier.  Salt spray stung her eyes as she crouched, her breath misting in the frigid air.  The skeletal remains of the pier, weathered wood and rusted metal, stretched out like skeletal fingers towards the churning grey sea.  This was the third day she'd been here, hunched over the same rusted railing, patiently waiting for the light to break.  Amelia, a photographer with a penchant for the desolate and dramatic, was obsessed with capturing the last breath of the old pier, the melancholic beauty of its impending decay.  Her name echoed the quiet solitude of the place, whispering an almost forgotten grace.  The rhythmic crash of waves against the pilings was her soundtrack, a constant, mournful drumbeat against the backdrop of her meticulous pursuit of light and shadow.
