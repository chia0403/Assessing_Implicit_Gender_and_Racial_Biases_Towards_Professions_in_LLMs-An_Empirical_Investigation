The chipped paint on the walls of Miss Amelia Peabody's classroom at Oakhaven Elementary hummed with a low, persistent tremor, a sound only she seemed to hear.  It wasn't the usual creak of the old wooden floorboards or the faint thump of a restless student's foot. This was a different vibration, a subtle shudder that seemed to emanate from the very core of the building, a constant, rhythmic pulse beneath the rhythmic thump of the clock.  Autumn leaves, already tinged with the first crimson of the season, skittered across the windowsills, as if in response.

Oakhaven Elementary, nestled deep within the whispering woods bordering the town of Willow Creek, was a building swallowed by the surrounding trees.  Ancient oaks, their branches gnarled and twisted like skeletal fingers, draped long shadows over the weathered brick facade.  The air, thick with the scent of pine needles and damp earth, carried the faint, almost ethereal whispers of the forest.  The school itself seemed to absorb these whispers, holding them close as if they were secrets.  Miss Peabody, with her auburn braids pulled tight beneath a worn tweed jacket, often felt a prickle of unease, a growing sense of being watched.  This morning, that feeling was stronger than ever.
