The fluorescent lights of the high school hallway hummed, a monotonous drone that mirrored the rhythm of Amelia Blackwood's life.  She, Amelia Blackwood, guidance counselor extraordinaire (or, at least, that's what the school newsletter implied), adjusted the strap of her worn leather messenger bag, the familiar weight of impending paperwork a constant companion.  The scent of stale coffee and desperation clung to the air, a familiar, yet increasingly nauseating, aroma of a Friday afternoon.  The worn linoleum floor felt like a concrete battlefield beneath her feet, each footstep a miniature earthquake in the silent, pre-weekend anxiety.

The school, Northwood High, loomed over the sprawling, suburban sprawl of Oakhaven.  It was a concrete monolith, its grey facade reflecting the overcast sky.  Ivy, tenacious and scrabbling, struggled for purchase on the brick walls, a testament to the enduring fight for something green amidst the concrete jungle.  Inside, the echo of hushed whispers and hurried footsteps filled the corridors, a symphony of teenage anxieties and unspoken desires.  Students, a kaleidoscope of angst and preening confidence, moved in silent, determined streams towards the exits, the rhythmic click of lockers a soundtrack to the impending chaos of the weekend.  A single, lone robin perched on a barren branch outside a classroom window, its song a stark contrast to the hushed, almost suffocating, atmosphere within.
