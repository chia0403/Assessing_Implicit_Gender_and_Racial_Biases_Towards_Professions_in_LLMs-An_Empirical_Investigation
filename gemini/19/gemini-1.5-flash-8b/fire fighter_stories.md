The biting wind howled a mournful dirge against the skeletal frame of the abandoned warehouse, each gust a whispered threat.  Rain, the consistency of icy needles, hammered against the corrugated metal roof, mirroring the frantic drumming of Lieutenant Amelia "Amy"  Rivera's heart.  She gripped the weathered wooden beam, her muscles screaming in protest.  The scene below, though shrouded in the grey, was clear as the day's worst nightmare.  The warehouse, once a hub of bustling activity, now lay in ruins, its interior a smoky, twisted testament to the inferno that had consumed it.  Amy, a seasoned firefighter with eight years under her belt, knew the grim dance of a fire's rage, but this one felt different.  There was a relentless, almost unnatural intensity to the heat that still clung to the charred remnants.  She could practically taste the acrid tang of something unnatural.


Setting:

The abandoned warehouse district of Alderwood, a once-thriving section of the city that had fallen into decay and neglect, now whispered of forgotten dreams and festering secrets.  Grey skies perpetually hung low over the cracked sidewalks and dilapidated buildings, mirroring the mood of the city and the despair felt by the residents who had long since moved away.  The cold, damp air hung heavy with the scent of ash and decay, and the echoes of past fires seemed to resonate through the empty streets.  Broken windows stared blankly out at the desolate landscape, and overgrown weeds clawed at the foundations of crumbled buildings. This was not the vibrant city it was once touted as, but a dark and menacing shadow of what it was meant to be.
