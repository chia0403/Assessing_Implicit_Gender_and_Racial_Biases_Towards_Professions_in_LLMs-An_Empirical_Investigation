Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the Blackwood Elementary school, mimicking the tempest brewing inside Dr. Eleanor Vance.  The fluorescent lights hummed, casting a sterile glow over the otherwise quiet school psychologist's office.  Empty except for a half-eaten granola bar on her desk, a discarded pen, and a mountain of paperwork overflowing from the overflowing filing cabinet, it felt more like a tomb than a sanctuary.  Blackwood Elementary.  A place where resilience was often tested, and hope, often buried beneath the weight of poverty and fractured families.  Eleanor, 37, with tired eyes and a perpetually smudged lipstick, had spent the last few hours wading through the latest barrage of referralsâ€”aggressive behaviour, anxiety, academic underperformance.  Each case a tiny shard of glass reflecting the broader societal issues bleeding into the school's fabric. The relentless rhythm of the rain outside hammered against the stillness of her thoughts. She stared at a faded photograph of a beaming child, pressed inside the worn cover of a notebook, a fleeting smile touching her lips. This little one, one of countless, needed her help.
