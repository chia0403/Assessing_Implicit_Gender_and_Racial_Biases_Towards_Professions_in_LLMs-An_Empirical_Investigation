The humid air hung heavy in the galley, thick with the cloying sweetness of jasmine tea and the faint, metallic tang of jet fuel.  Amelia Hayes, her name barely visible beneath the crisp, starched uniform of AirZen, felt the familiar pressure build in her chest.  Tonight, Flight 747, a trans-Pacific hop to Tokyo, was slated to be her last.  Her final flight.

The setting was the cramped, pressurized galley of AirZen's newest 787 Dreamliner, the 'Aurora'.  Gleaming stainless steel counters gleamed under the harsh fluorescent lights.  The faint hum of the plane's systems was a constant, low thrumming, blending with the rhythmic clatter of trays and the muffled murmur of passengers in the cabin beyond.  A small window, offering a fragmented view of the vast, star-speckled sky, framed a panorama of swirling clouds, each a different shade of gray, purple, and indigo. Outside, the city lights of Hong Kong blurred into the distant horizon, a testament to the ceaseless march of time.
