The fluorescent lights of the hallway hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Eleanor Vance's weary existence.  Dust motes danced in the pale illumination, mirroring the swirling anxieties of the students she saw pass her office door.  Each shuffling foot, each whispered conversation, carried a weight of unspoken pressures.  Eleanor, Guidance Counselor at the perpetually overscheduled Northwood High, felt the pressure herself, a tangible, almost physical force pressing down on her sternum.  The faded floral wallpaper of her office, once a comforting splash of colour, now seemed to mock her with its static beauty.  Outside, the crisp autumn air carried the scent of fallen leaves and the distant rumble of approaching storms.  Northwood High, nestled in the foothills of the Whispering Mountains, felt the chill of approaching winter long before the first snowfall.
