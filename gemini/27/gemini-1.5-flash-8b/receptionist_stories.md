The fluorescent lights of the "Apex Legal" office hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Butterfield's meticulously organized day.  Filing cabinets, lined with alphabetized folders, whispered secrets of past cases, past clients, and past triumphs—or failures. Amelia, a petite woman with a perpetually neat bun and a smile that was practiced but genuine, sat behind a mahogany desk cluttered only by the essential: a phone, a computer, and a stack of neatly-piled legal documents.  The office, situated in a nondescript high-rise overlooking the city's sprawling urban sprawl, felt sterile yet strangely comforting.  Sunlight, fractured by the skyscraper's many glass facades, barely touched the polished floors, casting long, dancing shadows that stretched across the reception area.  A low hum of hushed conversations, punctuated by the occasional sharp intake of breath, drifted through the otherwise quiet space from the conference rooms beyond. Today, however, a particular case—Case 347-Alpha—felt like a knot in her stomach.
