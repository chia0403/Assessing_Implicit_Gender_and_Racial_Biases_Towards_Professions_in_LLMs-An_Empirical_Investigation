The flickering neon sign of the "Radio Shack" cast a sickly yellow glow across the rain-slicked alley, illuminating the figure hunched over a battered workbench.  Rain hammered against the corrugated metal roof, a relentless percussion against the rhythmic hum of a faulty amplifier.  This was Elias Thorne's sanctuary, his workshop, his world.  Elias Thorne, radio technician extraordinaire, a man whose fingers, calloused and stained with solder, danced across circuits with a precision unmatched by any machine.  Tonight, however, the dance felt more like a frantic struggle.  He was wrestling not only with a balky shortwave receiver, but also with a burgeoning sense of unease. The city's symphony of sirens and honking taxis had a new, ominous undercurrent, a low thrumming that reverberated in the pipes and rattled the very foundations of the building. The year was 1948, and the air in the city of Newhaven felt thick with an unspoken fear.  The rain, relentless and cold, mirrored the chill that had settled over the city.
