The biting wind, a relentless, icy fist, clawed at the exposed skin of Sergeant Jasper Blackwood.  He pulled his threadbare wool coat tighter around himself, the coarse fabric offering little comfort against the swirling snow that blurred the already bleak landscape.  The jagged peaks of the Razorback Mountains, shrouded in a perpetual twilight, loomed like skeletal fingers against the bruised grey sky.  This was the Watchtower Pass, a desolate stretch of frozen earth, the only evidence of human habitation the crumbling stone walls of the abandoned fortress that Jasper patrolled.  Every night, the same desolate vigil, the same bone-chilling silence broken only by the mournful howl of the wind and the rhythmic thump of his own heart against his ribs.

Within the fortress walls, the air hung thick with the scent of damp stone and aged parchment.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of moonlight piercing the gloom.  Jasper, a man hardened by years of service, his face etched with the cold and weariness of the mountains, surveyed the empty corridors.  The only sound was the whisper of his breath against the frigid stone as he made his slow rounds. He was Sergeant Jasper Blackwood, one of the last remaining sentinels of the lost Protectorate.
