The fluorescent hum of the clinic, a perpetual, low thrumming, was the only constant in Amelia Blackwood's life.  The sterile white walls, the rhythmic beep of the heart monitors, the faint scent of antiseptic â€“ these were the familiar rhythms of her world.  She was a phlebotomist, a master of the vein, a weaver of connections between the living and the invisible.  Her job, though often monotonous, held a quiet dignity.  It was in the precise angles of her needle insertions, in the measured stillness of the patient's apprehension, that Amelia found a strange, almost meditative peace.  

The clinic, nestled in the shadow of the sprawling, industrial port city of Aethelgard, was a concrete box on the edge of a forgotten district.  Crumbling brick buildings and skeletal, rusted metal skeletons of factories clawed at the sky around it.  It wasn't the prettiest part of town, but it was home.  The air, thick with the smell of salt and the faint, acrid tang of industrial waste, clung to Amelia like a second skin.  Today, though, something felt different.  The usual murmur of hushed voices and the soft sighs of the unwell were amplified, replaced by a low, restless hum that seemed to emanate not from the machines, but from the very walls themselves.  A low, rumbling thrum resonated from the bowels of the building, and the hum felt heavier, more profound.
