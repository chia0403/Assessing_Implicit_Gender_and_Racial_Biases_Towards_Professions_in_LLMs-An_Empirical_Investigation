The flickering fluorescent lights of the Meadowbrook Rehabilitation Center hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Elara Nightingale's workday.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun slicing through the grime-streaked windows, highlighting the chipped paint and worn linoleum of the therapy room.  Elara, a registered occupational therapist with a perpetual weariness etched into her 32-year-old face, meticulously arranged a stack of brightly coloured therapy putty.  The scent of antiseptic and stale coffee hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume of institutional routines.  Today, however, the scent was tinged with something else â€“ a faint, metallic tang, a smell that clung to the air like a persistent whisper.  It was a whisper that sent a shiver down Elara's spine, a shiver that had nothing to do with the chilly air conditioning.  Her current patient, a man named Arthur Pendlebury, was due any moment.
