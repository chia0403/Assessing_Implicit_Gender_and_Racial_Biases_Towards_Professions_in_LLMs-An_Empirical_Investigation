The chipped paint of the "Scissors & Smiles" salon, a faded coral now more a sickly apricot, reflected the bruised, grey afternoon light filtering through the grimy windowpanes.  Rain hammered against the corrugated metal awning, a relentless percussion that vibrated through the worn linoleum floor.  Inside, Amelia Hawthorne, a wisp of a woman with eyes the colour of stormy seas, meticulously trimmed the unruly fringe of a teenage boy named Leo.  Her fingers, nimble and precise, danced across the thick, dark hair, creating a satisfying whisper of shears against strands.  The rhythmic snip-snip was the only sound apart from the relentless drumming outside. Amelia, though, wasn't listening to the rain. She was listening to the rhythmic, almost imperceptible *thump-thump* of something – or someone –  beneath the surface of the quiet salon.
