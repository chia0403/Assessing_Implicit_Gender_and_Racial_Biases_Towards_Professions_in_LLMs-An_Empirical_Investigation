The rhythmic thrum of the massage table beneath Amelia Grace Blackwood's hands was a familiar lullaby.  Sunlight, filtered through the dusty-rose curtains of her small, but meticulously organized, clinic, painted the room in a warm, comforting glow.  The aroma of lavender and something faintly citrusy hung heavy in the air, a scent Amelia carefully cultivated to create a calming atmosphere for her patients.  Today, however, the thrumming was amplified, not by the table's mechanical vibrations, but by the frantic pulse echoing in the quiet clinic.  Across from her, Liam O'Connell, a man whose shoulders seemed to carry the weight of the world, winced with each adjustment.  Amelia, despite her years of experience, felt a growing unease.  This wasn't just a typical backache.  This was something more profound, something that dug deeper than the muscles, deeper than the bones.


**Setting:**

Amelia Grace Blackwood's clinic, "The Aligned Spine," was tucked away on a quiet side street in the heart of a bustling, historic district.  The building itself was a weathered brick structure, a testament to the city's rich history, with ivy creeping up the walls and small, colourful flower boxes overflowing with vibrant blooms.  Inside, the polished hardwood floor, the softly lit room, and the carefully arranged collection of healing crystals gave a sense of calm and well-being.  Outside the windows, the cityâ€™s energy, with its horns and crowds, felt distant, as if the street had a protective bubble around the clinic.
