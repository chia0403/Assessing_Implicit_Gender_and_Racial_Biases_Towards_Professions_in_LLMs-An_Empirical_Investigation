The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's long auburn hair across her face, stinging her cheeks like a thousand tiny needles.  She huddled deeper into her thick wool coat, the worn leather of her camera bag a comforting weight against her chest.

But the relentless weather and the oppressive atmosphere were already testing her resolve.  She adjusted her camera strap, tightening it around her shoulder, and peered through the lens, searching for a glimpse of the hidden story within the crumbling stone.
