The flickering fluorescent lights of the Zenith Corporation headquarters cast long, skeletal shadows across the polished concrete floor.  Dust motes, tiny specks of forgotten corporate ambition, danced in the pale beams.  Amelia Penelope Thistlewick, a woman whose uniform—a faded, navy blue polo shirt and perpetually-stained khaki trousers—seemed to absorb rather than reflect the drab surroundings, meticulously wiped down a workstation.  Each swish of the microfiber cloth was accompanied by a faint, almost imperceptible, sigh.  The air, thick with the scent of stale coffee and the antiseptic tang of industrial cleaners, hung heavy, mirroring the oppressive atmosphere of the building itself.  This was her world, the forgotten heart of Zenith's glittering empire, a place where the echoes of success were drowned out by the constant hum of machinery and the hushed whispers of frustrated employees.  Outside, the city thrummed with a life Amelia rarely participated in, a life she observed from the sterile confines of the cleaning closets and storage rooms.
