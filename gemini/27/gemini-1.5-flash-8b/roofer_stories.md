The biting wind, a razor-edged whisper against Amelia "Ace"  Ashworth's weathered face, whipped the loose shingles around her like angry sparrows.  Below, the cobbled streets of Old Oakhaven snaked their way down the hill, a tapestry of muted greens and greys.  Sunlight, fractured and filtered through the skeletal branches of ancient oaks, painted the scene in a shifting mosaic of light and shadow.  Ace, perched precariously on a steeply pitched slate roof, felt the familiar thrill of the height, a dizzying dance between fear and freedom.  Her calloused fingers tightened on the rusted iron brace as she surveyed the damage.  A massive oak, centuries old and intertwined with the very heart of the town, had been felled by a storm, its mighty branches tearing through the rooftops like vengeful claws.  The roof of the historic apothecary, a landmark as old as the town itself, was in shambles.  The scent of cedar, aged wood, and a hint of something faintly sweet, the lingering perfume of lavender from the now-shattered apothecary window, hung heavy in the air.
