The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow over Amelia Nightingale, illuminating the dust motes dancing in the single shaft of moonlight slicing through the grime-streaked window.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale beer, cheap cigarettes, and something indefinablyâ€¦ metallic.  Amelia, a woman etched with the lines of countless late nights and whispered secrets, expertly poured a shot of whiskey into a chipped glass.  The bar, a relic of a bygone era, was a mausoleum of forgotten conversations and half-told stories.  Empty bottles lined the mahogany bar like fallen soldiers, their necks glinting with captured moonlight.  Tonight, however, the silence was thicker than the cigarette smoke, a disconcerting absence that seemed to press in on Amelia like a cold hand. Her name was etched onto a small brass plaque, just above the counter, a silent testament to her eight years behind this worn mahogany.  The chipped paint was slowly peeling away, a map charting the many years of hard-earned memories. This was her sanctuary, her battlefield, her stage. But tonight, the show seemed oddly still.  The only sound was the rhythmic clink of ice against glass and a single drip, drip, drip from the leaky faucet above.
