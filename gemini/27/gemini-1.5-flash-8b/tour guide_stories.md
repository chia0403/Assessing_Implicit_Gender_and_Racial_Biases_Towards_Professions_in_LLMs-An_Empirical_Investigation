Unlike the usual throngs of tourists eager to snap photos of the Astronomical Clock, the air in this quarter had a peculiar aura, a whisper of something darker, more profound.  The hushed silence was almost palpable.  Amelia, in her worn, but meticulously pressed, navy blue blazer, felt a prickle of anticipation, a sense of the unknown, and a very small, but persistent unease.
