The sterile white of the clinic walls pressed in on Amelia "Amy"  Harper, a registered dietitian with a penchant for vibrant colours and a perpetually messy bun.  Sunlight, fractured by the tall, imposing windows of "Nourish & Thrive,"  cast long shadows across the meticulously organised consultation rooms.  Today, however, the usual calm hum of the clinic felt charged, vibrating with an almost palpable sense of anticipation.  Amy, perched on the edge of a steel chair in her own office, watched the time tick by, the second hand on the minimalist clock an insistent metronome against the quiet hum of the building's HVAC.  Her client, a woman named Eleanor Vance, was running late.  Eleanor Vance, the owner of the sprawling organic farm that supplied most of the ingredients in the clinic's meticulously sourced meals.  Amy felt a knot tighten in her stomach.  This consultation wasn't just about nutrition; it was about Eleanor's farm, her livelihood, and a crisis that had been brewing for months. The smell of freshly baked sourdough wafted in from the adjacent kitchen, a stark contrast to the increasing tension Amy felt.  Outside, the vibrant colours of a summer sunset painted the sky a riot of gold and crimson, a visual representation of the opposite, chaotic energy swirling inside the clinic.
