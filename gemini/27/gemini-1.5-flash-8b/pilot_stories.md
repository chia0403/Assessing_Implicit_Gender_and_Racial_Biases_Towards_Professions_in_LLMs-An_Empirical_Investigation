The biting wind howled a mournful dirge against the viewport of Amelia "Milly"  Everett's cockpit, a symphony of icy whispers that mirrored the anxieties churning within her.  Below, the desolate, snow-blanketed landscape of the Arctic stretched out like a frozen canvas, a stark contrast to the shimmering, almost ethereal glow of the aurora borealis that painted the night sky in vibrant hues of green and purple.  Milly, her breath clouding the already frigid air, gripped the controls of the lone, heavily-armored Zephyr X-29, the only thing standing between herself and the unforgiving expanse of the icy wilderness.  The year was 2147.  The world had undergone a series of devastating climate shifts, leaving vast swathes of land uninhabitable.

Her mission: a crucial supply run to the isolated outpost of Esperanza, a mission vital not only to the survival of the inhabitants but to the precarious balance of the entire northern sector.  Each gust of wind, each shift in the aurora's dancing light, seemed to press on her shoulders, amplifying the weight of the responsibility.
