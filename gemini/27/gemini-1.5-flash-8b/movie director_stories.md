The flickering neon sign of the "Golden Reel" movie theatre cast a sickly yellow glow over the rain-slicked cobblestones of  Old Port, Halifax.  Rain lashed against the towering granite walls of the historic district, mirroring the tempest brewing within Amelia "Amy"  Stone's mind.  Amy Stone, a rising star in the independent film scene, stood hunched beneath the awning of a dimly lit café, nursing a lukewarm coffee and wrestling with the final scene of her upcoming feature, "The Mariner's Daughter."  The film, a fantastical romance set against the backdrop of 19th-century Halifax, was poised on the precipice of release, but a nagging, persistent doubt clung to Amy like the damp air.  Her protagonist, a young, resilient woman named Elara, felt… hollow.  The scene, supposed to be a moment of profound connection, felt flat, lifeless, a pale imitation of the passion she felt for the story and its characters. The relentless drumming of rain against the corrugated iron roof seemed to mock her frustration.
