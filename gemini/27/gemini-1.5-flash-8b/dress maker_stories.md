The chipped porcelain doll, Amelia Peabody, stared blankly from its perch on the windowsill, a single, dusty rose petal clinging to its painted cheek.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grime-coated windowpanes of 17 Elm Street.  This was the workshop of  Seraphina "Sera"  Ashworth, dressmaker extraordinaire, or at least, that’s what she used to tell herself.  Today, the needle felt strangely heavy in her calloused fingers, the fabric, silk the color of faded moonlight, felt more like lead than the delicate, flowing dream it was meant to be.  Outside, the city of Ashwood hummed with a restless energy, the ceaseless clatter of horse-drawn carriages and the cries of street vendors a constant counterpoint to the quiet desperation humming in Sera’s chest.

The small, cluttered workshop, barely larger than a broom closet, smelled faintly of lavender and mothballs.  Rows of faded silks and shimmering satins draped over rickety wooden racks, whispered stories of grand balls and whispered secrets.  Torn patterns and sketches, scribbled on scraps of parchment, littered the workbench, testament to countless dreams, both realized and lost.  A chipped teacup, stained a muted shade of crimson, sat on a table beside a half-finished gown, its delicate lace still clutched in Sera's vise-like grip.
