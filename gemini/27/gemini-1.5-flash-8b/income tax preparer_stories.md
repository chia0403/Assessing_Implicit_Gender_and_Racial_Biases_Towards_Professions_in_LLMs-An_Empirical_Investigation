The fluorescent lights of the "Tax Relief Express" hummed, a relentless, almost sinister thrum that echoed the anxieties swirling in Amelia Butterfield's chest.  Papers, mountains of them, piled high on her desk, each a miniature universe of deductions, credits, and withheld taxes.  Wednesdays were always brutal, a veritable avalanche of last-minute filings, and today was no exception.  The air in the tiny office, crammed with repurposed cubicles and the faint aroma of stale coffee, was thick with the unspoken desperation of her clientele.  Amelia, a meticulous income tax preparer with a perpetually tired smile and hands that seemed to fly across the keyboard, fought the urge to simply shut down and escape into the swirling grey of the impending storm brewing outside.

The Tax Relief Express was located in a small, unremarkable strip mall on the edge of the Rust Belt.  Buildings clung to each other, their facades a patchwork of faded paint and chipped brick, a monument to the economic downturn that had etched its mark on the surrounding communities.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight piercing the grime-coated windowpanes.  Outside, the rhythmic clatter of a passing train echoed the staccato rhythm of Amelia's typing fingers.  The only sound besides the train's rumble was the faint, almost imperceptible cry of a child, punctuated by the insistent jingle of the nearby laundromat's bell.  Each sound, each fragment of the world outside, served as a persistent reminder of the pressures Amelia faced, and the complex web of lives she was intricately intertwined with.
