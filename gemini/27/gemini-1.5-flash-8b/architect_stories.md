The biting wind whipped Amelia Cavendishâ€™s crimson scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks as she surveyed the skeletal frame of the new Zenith Tower.  Below, the city of Aethelgard sprawled like a patchwork quilt of grey stone and emerald rooftops, a stark contrast to the towering, skeletal structure of the tower that dominated the skyline.  Amelia, Architect Amelia Cavendish, felt a familiar knot of apprehension tighten in her chest.  Aethelgard, with its ancient history and even more ancient architectural traditions, was notoriously resistant to change.  This project, the Zenith Tower, a glass-and-steel behemoth reaching for the bruised twilight sky, was already drawing fire.  Her design, lauded by the city's modernists, was viewed with suspicion and outright disdain by the councilmen who prided themselves on preserving Aethelgard's aesthetic heritage.  The air, thick with the scent of rain-soaked cobblestones and burnt sugar from a nearby bakery, held a strange tension, a silent chorus of disapproval echoing in the gaps between the wind's sharp cries.  The tower, half-built and already scarred by the relentless weather, seemed to absorb that tension, reflecting it back in the fractured light of the setting sun.
