The desert wind, a relentless sandpaper against the cracked asphalt, whipped at the faded crimson paint of the rig.  Dust devils danced across the shimmering expanse of the Arizona highway, mimicking the erratic heartbeat thrumming in Elias "Stone" Stonebraker's chest.  He gripped the worn steering wheel, knuckles white, the rhythmic groan of the engine a counterpoint to the silence within his cab.  Late afternoon sun, a molten orb sinking below the jagged horizon, painted the sky in hues of bruised purple and fiery orange.  Stone, his eyes reflecting the fiery spectacle, knew this was the place where secrets buried themselves, and the road was the only witness.  

The setting:  A desolate stretch of Interstate 40, somewhere just beyond the New Mexico border, plunging into the heart of the Arizona desert. The year is 2024.  The air hung thick with the smell of sagebrush and impending heat.  A lone saguaro cactus, twisted and ancient, stood sentinel against the vast, empty landscape, its silhouette outlined against the fiery sky.   Stoneâ€™s faded trucker hat cast a long, dancing shadow over the dusty dashboard.  His rig, a battered but dependable Kenworth, was more than just a vehicle; it was an extension of his solitude, a silent confidante in this barren wasteland.
