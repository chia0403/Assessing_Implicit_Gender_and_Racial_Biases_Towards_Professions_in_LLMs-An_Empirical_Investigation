Broken instruments, chipped glass vials, and the faintest scent of pine needles, a relic from the forgotten forest that once thrived on the edge of the Waste, lay scattered around her.  The relentless march of the sands threatened to swallow everything whole, including the last vestiges of hope.  Each day was a desperate struggle against the encroaching oblivion, and tonight, a new patient lay waiting.
