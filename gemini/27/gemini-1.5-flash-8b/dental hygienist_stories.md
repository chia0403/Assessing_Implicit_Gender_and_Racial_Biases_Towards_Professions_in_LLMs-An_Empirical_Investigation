The fluorescent lights of Dr. Anya Petrova's office hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to the rhythmic click-clack of Amelia Hayes’s instruments.  Amelia, a dental hygienist with a name that felt both ordinary and oddly poetic, meticulously polished the back molars of a patient who mumbled something about needing a good sleep.  Amelia, however, wasn't thinking of sleep. She was thinking of the chipped tooth, the one tucked away in the back of her mind, like a stubborn piece of plaque.

The office, nestled on a quiet street lined with towering oaks, was a symphony of muted noises.  The gentle clinking of instruments, the soft sighs of patients, the low hum of the air purifier – a familiar comfort.  But today, there was something different. A tense quality hung in the air, thicker than the antiseptic mist from the ultrasonic scaler.  The usual bustling energy of the morning was missing, replaced by a quiet apprehension that seeped into Amelia's own thoughts.  A subtle shift in the usual routine.


Amelia had been working at Dr. Petrova's practice for five years, and she knew every nook and cranny of the office.  The faded floral wallpaper in the waiting room, the chipped porcelain figurines on the receptionist's desk, even the particular way the afternoon sun caught the dust motes dancing in the air.  But today, something felt…off.  The subtle scent of lilies, usually a soothing presence, seemed almost suffocating.
