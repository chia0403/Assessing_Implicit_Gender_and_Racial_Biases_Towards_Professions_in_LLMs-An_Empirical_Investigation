The biting wind whipped dust and shredded bits of faded highway signs into swirling eddies around Amelia "Milly"  Kingston.  She squinted, the sun glinting off the fractured asphalt of Route 66, a faded artery snaking through the desolate New Mexico landscape.  The year was 1958.  The air hung heavy with the scent of pine and something acrid, something akin to burnt sugar that clung to the parched earth.  Milly, her weathered leather jacket a shield against the chill, tightened her grip on the worn wrench.  Her calloused hands, stained a perpetual mix of grease and dust, were accustomed to this brutal rhythm.  This was the life she knew, the symphony of diesel engines and jackhammers, the lonely hum of the open road.  Her daily ritual, a dance of metal and grit, was played out on this stretch of highway, the very fabric of America, a canvas where dreams were as ephemeral as the desert dust.

The setting:  A desolate stretch of Route 66, somewhere in the high plains of New Mexico, 1958.  The landscape is a stark contrast of towering mesas, vast empty spaces, and the occasional rusting signpost, a testament to the highway's faded glory.  The heat during the day is oppressive and the nights are frigid.  The air is dry and the only sounds are the wind, the rhythmic clang of tools, the roar of passing vehicles (when there are any), and the occasional distant howl of a coyote.
