The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual, dull grey from years of simmering syrups and splattered frosting, reflected Amelia Blackwood’s freckled face.  Her reflection was blurry, smeared with the remnants of a particularly ambitious buttercream rose she’d been painstakingly sculpting.  The aroma of vanilla and almonds hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket around the small, cluttered bakery, "Sweet Surrender," nestled in the cobbled alleyways of the old city.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the grime-coated window, illuminating a meticulously arranged display of miniature wedding cakes, each one a miniature masterpiece of sugar and colour. Amelia, with her flour-dusted apron and a mischievous glint in her eye, sighed contentedly.  Another perfect creation, another day lived within the sweet, delicate confines of edible artistry.  The rhythmic clicking of her small metal spatula against the countertop was the only sound in the otherwise hushed space.  Today’s challenge: a three-tiered masterpiece for the esteemed Baron von Krumholtz, a notorious collector of whimsical confections.  He demanded a cake depicting the mythical creature known as the Sugarwing, a creature whose existence she doubted, but whose image was sure to challenge her skills.
