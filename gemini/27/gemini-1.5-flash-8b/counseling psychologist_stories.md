Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the small, ramshackle clinic, a relentless percussion that mirrored the storm brewing inside Dr. Anya Petrova.  The scent of damp earth and ozone hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the sterile, almost clinical smell of the antiseptic wipes and lavender spray that usually permeated her office.  Anya, a counseling psychologist with a decade of experience navigating the fractured psyches of others, felt utterly and terrifyingly lost in her own.

The clinic, nestled in the shadowed foothills of the Cascade Mountains, was a testament to its owner's tenacity more than its practicality.  Sunlight, when it dared to peek through the clouds, painted the faded yellow walls in fleeting streaks of amber.  A chipped porcelain sink sat beside a worn wooden table, littered with half-filled coffee cups and crumpled papers.  The entire room felt as though it was holding its breath, anticipating the inevitable burst.  This was Anya's sanctuary, her battlefield, her prison.  Tonight, it was all three.
