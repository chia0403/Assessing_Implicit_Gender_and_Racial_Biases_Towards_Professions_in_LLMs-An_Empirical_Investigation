This particular aisle, dedicated to high-end blenders, was a graveyard of unfulfilled desires.  Each sleek, stainless steel appliance seemed to mock her with its promise of effortless culinary perfection, while customers wandered past, eyes glazing over, their hands clasped tighter around their wallets.
