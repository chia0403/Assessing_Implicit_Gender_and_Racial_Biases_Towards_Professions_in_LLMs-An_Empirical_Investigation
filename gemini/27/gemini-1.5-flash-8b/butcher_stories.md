The chill of the pre-dawn air, sharp and biting, stung Bartholomew "Barty" Grimshaw's cheeks as he unlocked the heavy oak door of "Grimshaw's Good Cuts."  The flickering gas lamps cast long, dancing shadows across the cobblestones of the alleyway, highlighting the grime clinging to the brick walls.  A thin, almost imperceptible, layer of frost coated the metal hinges of the door, mirroring the frost that had already begun to paint the peaks of the surrounding rooftops.  Barty, a man whose face was weathered and scarred, like the very hides he worked with, pulled a heavy woolen scarf tighter around his neck.  The scent of damp earth and something faintly sweet, possibly brewing coffee from the nearby café, hung in the air.  Inside the shop, a faint but reassuring smell of blood and brine – the familiar smell of trade – hung in the heavy morning air.  Barty knew this ritual well, this precise choreography of opening and preparing the shop for the day's bounty, a ballet of butchery performed beneath the watchful gaze of the early morning.  Today, the meat was particularly plump.  Tomorrow, the market would have a festival.
