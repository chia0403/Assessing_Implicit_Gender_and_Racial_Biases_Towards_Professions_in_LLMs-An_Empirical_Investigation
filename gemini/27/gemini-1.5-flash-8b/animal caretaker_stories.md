The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's coat around her legs, stinging her cheeks with icy shards.  The sprawling, grey expanse of the Whispering Woods, usually a symphony of rustling leaves and chirping birds, was a desolate canvas under the bruised twilight sky.  Deep snow crunched beneath her boots as she trudged towards the abandoned, timber-framed Keeper's Hut, its once-bright paint now faded and peeling like sunburnt skin.  A low, mournful howl echoed through the woods, a sound that both pierced and soothed Amelia's soul.  She was a creature of habit, a creature of the animals, and tonight, the wolves of the Whispering Woods were calling to her.  Her name, whispered on the breath of the wind, was a promise, a responsibility, a life intertwined with the fate of the forest's creatures.  She was Amelia Blackwood, Keeper of the Whispering Woods.
