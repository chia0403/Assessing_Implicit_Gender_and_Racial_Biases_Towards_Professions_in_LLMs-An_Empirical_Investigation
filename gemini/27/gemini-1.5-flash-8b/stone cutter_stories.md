The biting wind, a relentless sculptor itself, whipped Amelia Stonehand's cloak around her as she surveyed the quarry.  Sunlight, fractured and pale, illuminated the jagged, grey face of Mount Aethelred.  Dust, fine as powdered stone, danced in the air, swirling around the weathered figures of her fellow workers.  Amelia, her name a testament to her profession, traced the contours of the mountain with a calloused finger, envisioning the intricate carvings that would soon adorn the grand cathedral of Eldoria.  She was a stone cutter, a whisperer of sculpted narratives, and today, the mountain held the silent promise of another masterpiece.  The quarry, nestled high in the jagged peaks of the Whispering Mountains, was a symphony of hammering, the rhythmic clang of steel on stone, punctuated by the occasional groan of the earth as a colossal slab of rock gave way.  This was her world, a world of grit and grace, of sweat and sculpted beauty.
