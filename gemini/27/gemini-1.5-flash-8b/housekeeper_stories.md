The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual, dull grey from decades of lukewarm water and forgotten soapsuds, mirrored the mood of Elara Blackwood.  The air in the sprawling Victorian mansion,  Oakhaven Manor, hung heavy with the scent of lavender and something indefinably… stagnant.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun slicing through a grime-coated windowpane, illuminating a miniature, dust-covered world of forgotten teacups and half-finished embroidery projects.  Elara Blackwood, housekeeper for the past ten years, felt the weight of the house pressing down on her, a tangible oppression that had settled like cobwebs in the corners of her heart.  Ten years.  Ten years scrubbing away at the ghosts of parties long past, the echoes of laughter swallowed by the creaking floors, and the silent whispers of secrets locked within the ornate mahogany furniture.  Today, however, a new, distinct scent mingled with the lavender: a pungent, unfamiliar aroma of pine and something… metallic.  It clung to the air, a stark contrast to the usual musty quiet, and sent a shiver down Elara's spine.
