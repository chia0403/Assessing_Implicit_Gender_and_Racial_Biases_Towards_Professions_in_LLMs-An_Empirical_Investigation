The flickering gaslight cast long, theatrical shadows across the cobbled alleyway, illuminating the chipped paint of the back entrance to the Grand Theatre of Dreams.  Rain, a relentless curtain of grey, hammered against the corrugated iron roof.  Inside, nestled amongst the tangled aroma of sawdust and old theatrical make-up,  Amelia Nightingale, Director of the Grand Theatre, meticulously arranged a single, wilting crimson rose on a chipped porcelain pedestal.  It was a gesture, she knew, as much for herself as for the phantom of a play sheâ€™d been wrestling with for weeks.  Tonight, the curtain would rise on a final, desperate attempt. The play, she hoped, would be the culmination of years of struggle, the culmination of a love both passionate and disastrous.  The setting was, in a way, a microcosm of her own life: a once glorious theatre, now tarnished, struggling to reclaim its past brilliance, just like her own heart.  Amelia knew that tonight's performance would determine the fate of the Grand Theatre, and her future within it.
