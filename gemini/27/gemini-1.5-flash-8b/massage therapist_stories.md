The scent of jasmine and sandalwood hung heavy in the air, clinging to the polished wood floors and the silk drapes of the "Serene Sanctuary."  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a rhythmic counterpoint to the soft whoosh of the air purifier.  Within the dimly lit room, nestled amongst the plush velvet cushions and the array of calming crystals, lay Amelia Nightingale.  Her fingers, long and elegant, danced across the back of a client, a renowned architect named Alistair Finch, expertly kneading the tension from his shoulders.  Alistair, usually a man of firm pronouncements and precise calculations, had fallen silent, his breath shallow and even.  Tonight, Amelia felt a different energy, a palpable current pulsing beneath the surface of the quiet, a strange unease that permeated the space around them.  The rain outside intensified, the wind howling like a tormented spirit, and the faint, almost imperceptible hum of the city outside seemed to echo within the sanctuary.
