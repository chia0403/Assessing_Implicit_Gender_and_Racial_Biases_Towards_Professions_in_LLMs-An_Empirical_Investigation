The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the cobblestones of Fleet Street, London, 1888.  Rain hammered against the ornate, dark-grey windows of the Grand Victoria Hotel, a symphony of rhythmic drumming that punctuated the hushed whispers emanating from within.  Inside, amidst the opulent grandeur of the dining hall, a young man named Bartholomew "Barty"  Featherstonehaugh, meticulously polished a brass bellhop's tray.  The intricate carvings of the tray, depicting scenes of mythical beasts, seemed to mock the grime clinging stubbornly to the polished wood beneath.  Barty, though only twenty-two, had the weathered, practiced grace of someone far older, his movements as precise as a clockmaker's.  He adjusted the polished brass bell, its smooth surface reflecting the flickering light, and sighed.  Another night, another endless stream of well-dressed, demanding guests.  Tonight, however, a sense of unease settled over the hotel, a palpable chill that went beyond the London drizzle.  A murmur of whispers, hushed and conspiratorial, circulated among the staff. Something was amiss.
