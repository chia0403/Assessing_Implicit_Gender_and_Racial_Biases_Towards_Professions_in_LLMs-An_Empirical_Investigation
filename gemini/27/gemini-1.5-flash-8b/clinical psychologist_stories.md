Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, a relentless percussion that mirrored the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Amelia Hayesâ€™s heart.  The fluorescent lights of the waiting room hummed, casting a sterile, almost oppressive glow on the worn, floral patterned chairs.  Outside, the grey sky mirrored the gloom that clung to Amelia, a persistent fog of anxiety that thickened with each passing minute.  She was a clinical psychologist, specializing in trauma, and yet, the weight of the session ahead pressed down on her like a physical burden.

The setting:  a small, privately owned practice tucked away in the quiet, slightly dilapidated streets of a forgotten corner of the city.  Dust motes danced in the weak light filtering through the grimy windows, suggesting a neglect that felt all too familiar to Amelia. The air, thick with the scent of old paper and disinfectant, hung heavy and still, a silent testament to the unspoken stories held within those walls.  Today, one of those stories belonged to a man named Arthur Blackwood, a veteran of the recent war in the East, whose haunted eyes held a reservoir of pain that mirrored the relentless rain outside.
