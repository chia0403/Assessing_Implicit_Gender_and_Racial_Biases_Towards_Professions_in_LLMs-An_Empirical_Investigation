The biting wind whipped across the frozen expanse of Lake Geneva, stinging Amelia Blackwood's cheeks and rattling the metal frame of her battered gazebo.  Snow, the consistency of crushed ice, crunched underfoot as she paced, a familiar knot tightening in her stomach.  It was the eve of the annual Geneva Glacier Games, the pinnacle of competitive ice hockey in the region, and Amelia, Head Coach of the Glacier Gladiators, felt a familiar pre-game tremor.  Not the nervous energy of excitement, but a cold, calculated fear â€“ a fear that gnawed at her even as she reassured her players.  She was facing a team known for their ruthless precision, and rumours swirled that their coach, a legendary figure named Viktor "The Ice" Volkov, was employing tactics unheard of in competitive ice hockey.  The gazebo, nestled beneath the skeletal branches of a towering pine, offered scant protection against the elements, and a melancholy frost clung to the air, mirroring the unease in Amelia's heart.
