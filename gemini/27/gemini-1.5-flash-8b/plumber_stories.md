The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Always A Leak" plumbing shop hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic drip, drip, drip of a leaky faucet that seemed to be mocking Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's every frustrated sigh.  Barty, a plumber with a mop of unruly brown hair that seemed to defy gravity, hunched over a basin filled with suspiciously murky water.  He was tracing the intricate network of pipes, his brow furrowed in concentration, a half-eaten sandwich abandoned on a nearby workbench.  The shop, crammed with tools and spare parts, smelled faintly of copper and despair.  Stacks of invoices, each bearing the telltale scrawl of angry customers, sat precariously balanced atop a battered filing cabinet.  Outside, the relentless London rain hammered against the grimy windowpanes, mirroring the insistent hammering of Barty's own anxieties.  Today was shaping up to be just another Wednesday in his life, a Wednesday marked with the potential for more angry calls, more stubborn clogs, and more frustrating leaks.
