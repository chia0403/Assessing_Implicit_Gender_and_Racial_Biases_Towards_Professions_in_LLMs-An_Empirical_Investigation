The greasy haze hung thick in the air of "Rusty's Wrench & Wail," the aroma of burnt oil mingling with the sweet, sickly scent of exhaust fumes.  Rain hammered against the corrugated metal roof, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic rhythm of Amelia "Mech"  Hamilton's wrench against the engine block.  The shop, nestled in the shadowed alleyway behind the bustling marketplace of Old Port, was a testament to the city's relentless rhythm â€“ a symphony of clanks, groans, and the occasional, frustrated curse.  Mech, her brow beaded with sweat, concentrated on the stubborn cylinder head, her calloused fingers wrestling with the recalcitrant bolts.  Outside, the vibrant colours of the market faded into the gloom, swallowed by the encroaching twilight.  A lone streetlamp cast a flickering orange light across the alley, highlighting the grime-coated tools scattered on the workbench, the remnants of the day's battles fought and won (and sometimes, lost) against the mechanical hearts of the city's vehicles.
