The flickering fluorescent lights of the emergency room hummed, a discordant soundtrack to the chaotic symphony of sirens wailing outside and the frantic whispers of nurses scurrying through the sterile corridors.  Rain lashed against the windows, blurring the already hazy cityscape.  Dr. Eleanor Vance, her crisp white coat slightly dampened, surveyed the scene.  A crumpled form lay on the gurney, her breath shallow and uneven.  The air, thick with the metallic tang of blood and the antiseptic smell of disinfectant, clung to her, a suffocating embrace.  This was her world, the relentless ballet of life and death played out under the unforgiving glare of the hospital clock.

Setting: The emergency room of the sprawling, grey metropolis's Saint Jude's Hospital.  A massive, high-ceilinged space, punctuated by the sterile white of walls and the ominous, deep red of the emergency rooms' inner sanctum. The constant clamor of beeping monitors and the rhythmic thump of CPR machines provided the rhythmic pulse of the hospital. The city outside, perpetually shrouded in rain, reflected the relentless intensity of the situation inside.
