The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual, dull rose, reflected the flickering gaslight hanging precariously from the ceiling of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's barbershop.  Dust motes danced in the faint light, illuminating the swirling patterns in the thick, dark oil that coated the floor.  A single, brass-handled shears hung on the wall, its sharp edge gleaming faintly.  This was The Rusty Razor, a haven of faded glory nestled in the shadowed alleys of the burgeoning industrial city of Ashworth, a place where the scent of coal smoke mingled with the faint, sweet aroma of lavender balm.  Barty, his face creased with the lines of countless hours spent wielding his clippers, expertly snipped at a stubborn lock of unruly brown hair.  His patient, a stout man named Silas, sat slumped in the worn leather chair, muttering about the upcoming mayoral election and the rising cost of ale.  Outside, the rumble of carriages and the cries of hawkers filled the night air, a constant, restless symphony of Ashworth's ceaseless activity.  Barty, though immersed in his task, felt a subtle unease settling over him.  A premonition, a flicker of something he couldn't quite name.
