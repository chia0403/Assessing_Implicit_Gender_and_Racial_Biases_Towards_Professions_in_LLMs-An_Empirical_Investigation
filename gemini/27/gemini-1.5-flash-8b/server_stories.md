The flickering neon sign of the Rusty Mug cast a sickly yellow glow over the rain-slicked cobblestones.  Torrential downpour hammered against the corrugated iron roof, echoing the frantic rhythm of Amelia "Anya" Petrova's heart.

Anya, a server with eyes the colour of storm clouds and a perpetually tired smile, navigated the crowded room, her movements a blur of frantic efficiency.  Tonight, the patrons were particularly demanding, their voices rising above the tempest outside, their laughter echoing with the urgency of a drowning man's plea.
