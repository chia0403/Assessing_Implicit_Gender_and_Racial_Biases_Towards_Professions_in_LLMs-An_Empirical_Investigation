The flickering neon sign of the "Golden Horseshoe Saloon" cast a sickly yellow glow across Detective Isabella "Izzy" Diaz's rain-slicked trench coat.  The air, thick with the scent of stale beer and something indefinably sour, hung heavy in the alleyway behind the establishment.  Dust motes danced in the single beam of her flashlight, illuminating a discarded cigarette pack and a pool of viscous, dark liquid that smelled distinctly of motor oil.  The alley, a forgotten artery of the city's seedy underbelly, snaked between towering warehouses, each brick fa√ßade whispering tales of forgotten fortunes and broken dreams.  Izzy traced the outline of a faint footprint in the grime, a single, almost childlike print imprinted into the hardened asphalt.  This was her new patrol area, District 19, a gritty landscape of fractured hope and simmering resentment, and this case, whatever it was, was already digging its claws into her.  The city, a sprawling tapestry of light and shadow, held its breath, waiting to see how the night would unfold.
