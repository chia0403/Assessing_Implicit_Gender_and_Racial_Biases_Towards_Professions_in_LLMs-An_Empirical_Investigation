The chipped porcelain of the apothecary jar felt cool beneath Elara Vance’s fingertips.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single, sputtering gas lamp above, danced in the thick, cloying air of “Vance’s Remedies,” a pharmacy as old as the cobblestones lining the narrow, rain-slicked street outside.  The scent of dried herbs – chamomile, lavender, and something faintly acrid that Elara couldn’t quite place – hung heavy, a familiar perfume that clung to her like a second skin.  Outside, the relentless November wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the windowpanes of the ancient building, a symphony of decay that matched the melancholic state of Elara’s heart.  This wasn't the bustling, bright city center; this was Oakhaven, a town clinging to the edge of the whispering woods, where secrets festered as stubbornly as the damp in the crumbling mortar of her family's pharmacy.
