The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Amy” Hernandez’s hair across her face as she wrestled a stubborn length of rebar into place.  Her breath plumed out in white clouds, quickly swallowed by the grey, swirling expanse above the half-built skyscraper.  Below, the city of Chicago stretched out like a sprawling, concrete tapestry, its familiar landmarks – the Willis Tower, a sliver of Lake Michigan – diminished to miniature scale from her precarious perch fifty stories high.  The air hummed with the tireless drone of construction, a symphony of clanking steel, whining machinery, and the shouted commands of foremen.  Amy, however, heard none of it.  Her focus was entirely on the rebar, her gloved hands chapped and raw, her muscles screaming in protest against the relentless cold and the physical demands of her job. This wasn't just another day at the office; this was the culmination of years of hard work, a brutal climb up the ranks from unskilled laborer to a key member of the crew erecting Chicago's newest icon – the Zenith Tower.  And today, something felt… different.
