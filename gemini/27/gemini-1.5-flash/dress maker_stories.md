The scent of lavender and old silk hung heavy in the air, a comforting perfume that clung to the dusty velvet curtains and the worn wooden floors of Esmelia "Esme" Hawthorne's atelier.  Sunlight, fractured by the grimy panes of the attic window, painted dancing shards of gold across bolts of emerald brocade, sapphire satin, and sun-bleached linen stacked haphazardly against the walls.  Dust motes, illuminated in the golden beams, swirled like miniature galaxies in the quiet stillness of the room.  Outside, the relentless London rain hammered against the slate roof, a steady rhythm against the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of Esmeâ€™s shears, as she meticulously cut a length of the finest ivory silk, her brow furrowed in concentration.  This wasn't just any dress; this was for Lady Beatrice Ashworth's debutante ball, and Esme, despite her humble surroundings, was determined to create a gown that would be the talk of the season.
