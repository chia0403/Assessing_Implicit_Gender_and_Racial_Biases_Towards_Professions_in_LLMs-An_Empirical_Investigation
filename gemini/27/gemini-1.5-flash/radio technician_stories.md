The smell of ozone and burnt capacitors hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Elias Thorne, Radio Technician Third Class.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single bare bulb swinging precariously above his workbench, danced in the stagnant air of the repurposed shipping container that served as his workshop.  Rain lashed against the corrugated iron sides, a relentless drumming that competed with the static hiss emanating from the ancient shortwave radio crackling on his bench – a constant, low-level anxiety mirroring the gnawing unease in Elias’s gut.  The container, perched precariously on the edge of the rust-eaten docks of Port Blossom, swayed gently with the rhythm of the waves crashing against the pilings below, a testament to the city's precarious hold on the encroaching sea.  Tonight, however, the unease wasn't just the weather; it was the whisper on the wind, a coded message Elias suspected was far more dangerous than any storm.
