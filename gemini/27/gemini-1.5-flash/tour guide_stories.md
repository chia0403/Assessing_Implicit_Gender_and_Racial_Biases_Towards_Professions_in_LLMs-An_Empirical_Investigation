The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of frangipani and diesel fumes, a peculiar perfume unique to the chaotic streets of Bangkok.  Sweat beaded on Amelia Hernandezâ€™s forehead, clinging to the thin fabric of her crisp, white linen shirt.  The midday sun beat down mercilessly on the sprawling Wat Arun, its porcelain-encrusted spires shimmering like a mirage in the heat haze.  Amelia adjusted the microphone clipped to her collar, her practiced smile unwavering despite the oppressive conditions.  Thirty tourists, a motley crew of sunburnt Australians, camera-toting Japanese, and a quiet group of Canadians huddled under mismatched parasols, waited expectantly.  This was her fourth tour of the day, and Amelia, seasoned Bangkok tour guide extraordinaire, was ready to weave her magic, to transform these disparate individuals into a captivated audience enthralled by the wonders of Thailand's ancient temples.
