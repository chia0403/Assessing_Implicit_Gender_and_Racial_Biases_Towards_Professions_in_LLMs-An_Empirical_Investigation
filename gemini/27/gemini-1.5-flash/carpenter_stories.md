The wind, a relentless, howling beast from the north, threatened to rip the rough-hewn wood right out of his calloused grip.  He hunched deeper into his thick wool coat, the collar pulled high, its worn fabric offering little protection against the biting November air.

The rhythmic crash of waves against the rocks below provided a constant, almost deafening soundtrack to his work, a grim reminder of the power of nature he constantly battled, both in the sea and in the stubborn heart of the timber he wrestled into submission.
