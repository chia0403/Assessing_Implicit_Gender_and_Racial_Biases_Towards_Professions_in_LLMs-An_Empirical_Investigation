The scent of ozone hung heavy in the air, a sharp counterpoint to the cloying sweetness of vanilla and coconut emanating from the hair products lining the shelves. Rain lashed against the single window of Penelope "Penny" Featherstonehaugh's salon, blurring the already hazy neon glow of the "Shear Perfection" sign across the street.  Inside, however, the only light came from a single, bare bulb swinging precariously above her worn, wooden barber's chair.  Penny, a woman whose age was as indeterminate as the colour of her perpetually streaked hair (somewhere between auburn and rust, depending on the light), hummed a melancholic blues tune as she meticulously sharpened her shears, the rhythmic rasp a soothing contrast to the storm raging outside.  Her tiny salon, tucked away on a cobbled alleyway in the heart of Grimsborough, felt like a haven, a sanctuary from the relentless downpour and the even more relentless anxieties of the outside world.
