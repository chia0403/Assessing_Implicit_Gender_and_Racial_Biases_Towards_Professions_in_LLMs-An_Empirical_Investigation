The humid Louisiana air hung heavy, thick as sugarcane syrup, clinging to Amelia Jean Dubois like a second skin.  Sweat beaded on her forehead, mirroring the tiny droplets clinging to the chipped paint of the porch swing where she sat.  Amelia Jean, or A.J. as most people called her, adjusted the crisp, starched collar of her sales uniform â€“ a pale blue cotton shirt that felt utterly inappropriate in the stifling heat.  Before her stretched a landscape of crumbling clapboard houses and overgrown yards, the faded glory of Bayou Lafourche whispering tales of better times, and worse.  She clutched her battered briefcase, its leather softened by years of sun and rain, and sighed.  This wasn't exactly the corporate high-rise she'd envisioned when she'd graduated top of her class at LSU, but then again, selling encyclopedias door-to-door in the backwoods of Louisiana wasn't exactly what anyone envisioned, either.
