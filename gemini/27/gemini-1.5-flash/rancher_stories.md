The wind, a relentless sculptor, carved patterns into the ochre dust devils that danced across the parched Texas plains.  Sun, a molten coin in the brassy sky, beat down on the weathered face of Elias Thorne, his skin as rough and creased as the leather of his worn saddle.  Dust motes, caught in the shimmering heat haze, hung suspended above the sprawling Thorne Ranch, a kingdom of scrub and mesquite that stretched as far as the eye could see, swallowed by the vast, indifferent landscape.  The only sound louder than the wind's mournful sigh was the rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* of Elias's boots as he walked towards the dilapidated barn, the skeletal remains of a long-forgotten storm lingering in the warped wood.  This year, the drought had been particularly merciless, leaving the land and its inhabitants bone-dry and desperate.
