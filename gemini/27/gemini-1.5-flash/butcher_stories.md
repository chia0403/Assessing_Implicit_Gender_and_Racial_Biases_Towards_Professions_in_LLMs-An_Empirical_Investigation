The rasp of the steel on bone was a familiar lullaby to Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield.  Dawn, a bruised purple smudge on the eastern horizon, bled into the butcher shop, painting the sawdust-strewn floor in shifting shades of grey and violet.  Barty, his apron stained a tapestry of blood and grime that told a silent story of a thousand cuts, worked with a practiced ease that belied the brutal nature of his craft.  The air hung thick with the metallic tang of freshly-killed meat, mingled with the earthy scent of potatoes stacked in burlap sacks and the sharp, sweet perfume of rosemary hanging from a rafter above.  Outside, the cobblestone streets of Oakhaven were still drowsy, but inside Butterfield's Fine Meats, the day's work had already begun.
