The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume only Aurelia “Auri” Blackwood could concoct.  It clung to the plush velvet armchairs in her salon, "Shear Genius," a haven tucked away on a cobbled side street in the historic district of Prague.  Rain, the kind that lashed down in relentless sheets, hammered against the leaded-glass windows, blurring the already hazy gaslight glow illuminating the ancient, crooked buildings opposite. Inside, Auri hummed a melancholic Czech folk tune, her nimble fingers weaving magic into a client’s tangled blonde hair, the rhythmic snip-snip-snip a counterpoint to the tempest raging outside. The salon, despite its intimate size, felt strangely insulated from the storm – a pocket of warmth and quiet artistry in a city teeming with secrets.
