The wrench slipped in Archibald "Archie" P. Butterfield's greasy hand, clattering onto the grimy concrete floor of the abandoned brewery with a hollow clang that echoed unnervingly through the cavernous space. Dust motes, disturbed by the sound, danced in the single shaft of moonlight slicing through a gaping hole in the roof, illuminating the intricate network of pipes snaking across the ceiling like rusted, metallic veins.  The air hung thick with the ghosts of stale beer and damp earth, a chilling contrast to the humid sweat beading on Archie's brow.  He wasn't supposed to be here, not in this derelict behemoth of crumbling brick and forgotten machinery, miles outside the sleepy town of Oakhaven, but the lure of a hefty, hush-hush job had proven too tempting to resist.  The job description: "Unclog the impossible." The pay: enough to finally fix the leaky roof on his own ramshackle cottage.
