The fluorescent lights of the Zenith Corporation hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Katherine Finch's otherwise silent morning.  Amelia, or Amy as most people – though precious few *actually* knew her – called her, sat behind her pristine, glass-topped desk, the Zenith logo subtly embossed in the corner.  The air conditioning blasted a frigid wind, doing little to combat the simmering resentment that brewed in her stomach.  Outside, the pre-dawn gloom of a Chicago November clung to the skyscrapers, mirroring the grey despair that threatened to engulf Amy's already tedious Tuesday.  The only sound besides the humming lights was the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of her perfectly manicured fingernails against the polished surface of her desk, a counterpoint to the frantic drumming of her heart.  Today was the day. The day Mr. Henderson, the notoriously tyrannical CEO, was returning from his "executive retreat" – a euphemism, Amy suspected, for a lavish golfing trip in the Bahamas – and the day, she feared, everything might change forever.
