But tonight, the rhythmic click-clack of his worn leather boots on the uneven pavement was the only beat keeping time with the frantic drumming of his heart.  Oakhaven, nestled deep within a valley shrouded by ancient, whispering woods, was usually a picture of peaceful slumber by this hour.  Tonight, however, a different kind of stillness hung in the air – a stillness pregnant with unspoken dread.
