The biting wind whipped Elias Thorneâ€™s beard across his frost-chapped face, stinging like a thousand tiny needles.  He hunched deeper into his worn, wool coat, the collar pulled high to shield his neck from the relentless assault of the Alaskan winter.  Towering Douglas firs, their branches thick with snow, loomed around him like silent sentinels, their ancient forms etched against a sky the colour of bruised plums.  The air, thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, hung heavy and cold, a stark contrast to the roaring fire that crackled merrily in the small, makeshift cabin nestled amongst the behemoths of the forest.  Elias, a man carved from the same rugged terrain he worked, paused his chopping, the rhythmic thud of his axe momentarily stilled, a single snowflake melting on his thick, calloused hand.  This wasn't just any logging camp; this was the heart of the Whisperwind Woods, a place whispered about in hushed tones, a place where the trees seemed to hold their breath, and the wind itself carried secrets.
