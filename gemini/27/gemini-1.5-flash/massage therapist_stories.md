The scent of lavender and sandalwood hung heavy in the air, a comforting balm against the relentless drumming of the Seattle rain against the windowpanes of Serenity Spa.  Water cascaded down the glass, blurring the neon lights of Pike Place Market into a shimmering, indistinct glow. Inside, amidst the hushed whispers and the soft thrum of ambient music,  Eleanor Vance, a massage therapist with hands as skilled as they were gentle, prepared for her last client of the day.  The worn leather of her massage table, softened by years of countless back rubs and shoulder kneads, creaked softly under her touch as she smoothed out the crisp white sheet.  The flickering candlelight reflected in her tired, but kind, hazel eyes.  Tonight, however, the usual calming routine felt oddly charged, a premonition of somethingâ€¦ different hanging in the air, thicker than the scent of essential oils.
