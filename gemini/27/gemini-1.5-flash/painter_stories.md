The biting November wind whipped Amelia Katherine Finch’s hair across her face, stinging her cheeks a rosy red that clashed spectacularly with the bruised purple of the twilight sky.  She pulled her worn wool shawl tighter, the rough texture a comfort against the chill that seeped into her bones as deeply as the grey into the slate-tiled roofs of the ancient Cornish village of Portwenn.  The fishing boats, bobbing gently in the harbour, were silhouetted against a turbulent sea the colour of a leaden bruise, mirroring the stormy hues dominating Amelia’s latest canvas, propped precariously against the weathered stone wall of her tiny, ivy-covered cottage.  The air hung heavy with the salty tang of the sea and the earthy scent of decaying seaweed, a familiar perfume that always seemed to inspire, or perhaps, more accurately, to haunt, her art.
