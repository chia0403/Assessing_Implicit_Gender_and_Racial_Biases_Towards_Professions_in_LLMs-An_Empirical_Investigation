The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Hernandez’s hands, the lukewarm chamomile tea doing little to soothe the icy dread clenching her stomach.  Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of her office, blurring the usually vibrant cityscape of San Francisco into a watercolour smear of grey and black.  Below, the cacophony of honking taxis and chattering pedestrians was muffled, a low hum that mirrored the persistent throbbing in Amelia’s temples.  Her office, nestled on the twenty-second floor of a sleek, modern building overlooking Fisherman’s Wharf, usually felt like a sanctuary – a haven of healthy smoothies and meticulously planned meal plans.  But today, the panoramic view offered no solace.  Today, Amelia Hernandez, Registered Dietitian and certified holistic nutritionist, felt utterly and completely lost.
