The aroma of argan oil and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a perfume as familiar to Seraphina “Sera” Moreau as the scent of her own skin.  Rain lashed against the tall, gothic windows of her salon, "Shear Perfection," each drop a tiny percussion against the otherwise hushed elegance of the space.  Shear Perfection wasn't your average hair salon; nestled on the third floor of a renovated brownstone in the heart of New Orleans's French Quarter, it boasted exposed brick walls adorned with antique mirrors and a chandelier that dripped with faux crystal, casting a glittering, slightly unsettling light on the plush velvet armchairs.  Outside, the cacophony of jazz music and the rumble of streetcars battled the rhythmic drumming of the downpour, a chaotic symphony that somehow complemented the calm, almost ritualistic atmosphere within.  Sera, perched on a tall stool before a vanity, delicately applied highlights to a client's already vibrant auburn hair, her own raven locks braided tightly against her neck.  Tonight, however, the usual comforting rhythm of her work was overshadowed by an unsettling premonition, a prickling sensation at the nape of her neck that hinted at something far more dramatic than a botched balayage.
