The scent of Bay Rum and stale coffee hung thick in the air, a familiar perfume to Elias Thorne, proprietor of Thorne's Tonsorial Parlour.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single, bare bulb swinging precariously above his worn barber's chair, danced in the afternoon sun slanting through the grimy windowpane.  Outside, the cobblestones of Hemlock Street gleamed, slick with recent rain, reflecting the muted grey of a November sky.  Elias, his hands gnarled and stained a permanent mahogany from years of wielding clippers and razors, wiped down his already immaculate countertop with a rag the colour of a bruised plum.  The silence, broken only by the rhythmic ticking of a grandfather clock in the corner, felt heavy, pregnant with the unspoken anxieties of a town holding its breath.  This was Havenwood, a place where secrets were as common as the dust settling on Elias's shelves, and he, the town barber, was the unwitting custodian of many.
