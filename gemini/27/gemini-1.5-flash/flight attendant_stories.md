The recycled air hung thick and stale, a cloying perfume of cheap coffee and anxiety.  Amelia Grace Hawthorne, a woman whose smile lines belied a weariness deeper than any overnight layover, adjusted the tiny, infuriatingly crooked pin on her crisp Air Pacific uniform.  Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of the Honolulu International Airport crew lounge, blurring the already hazy outline of Diamond Head.  Inside, the air buzzed with the low hum of exhaustion and the nervous chatter of pilots and cabin crew, all awaiting their respective assignments for the upcoming red-eye to Auckland. Amelia, however, felt a disquiet far sharper than the usual pre-flight jitters.  It wasn't the looming fourteen-hour flight, nor the prospect of yet another tray of lukewarm pasta, but a prickling sense of somethingâ€¦off. Something she couldn't quite place, a discordant note in the usual symphony of airport chaos.  The scent of plumeria, usually a sweet balm to her frazzled nerves, felt heavy, almost suffocating tonight.
