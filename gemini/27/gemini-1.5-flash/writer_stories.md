The chipped paint of the windowsill dug into Elara Vance’s elbows as she stared out at the churning grey sea.  October wind, smelling sharply of brine and decaying kelp, whipped strands of her already unruly auburn hair across her face.  Elara, a writer whose best work always seemed to bloom from the bleakest landscapes, found a strange comfort in the storm raging outside her tiny cottage perched precariously on the cliffs of Cornwall’s rugged northern coast.  The cottage, aptly named "Sea Wraith," was as temperamental as the ocean itself; its ancient timbers groaned and sighed with every gust, a symphony of creaks that often found its way into Elara’s prose. The rhythmic crash of waves against the rocks below provided a relentless, almost hypnotic soundtrack to her solitary life.  Inside, a fire crackled merrily in the hearth, a defiant orange glow against the encroaching gloom.  But even the warmth couldn’t quite chase away the creeping chill that had settled deep in her bones, a chill that had nothing to do with the weather.  It was a chill born of writer’s block, a formidable foe that had Elara trapped in its icy grip for weeks.
