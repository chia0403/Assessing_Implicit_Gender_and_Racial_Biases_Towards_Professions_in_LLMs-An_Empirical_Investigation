The acrid bite of woodsmoke hung heavy in the air, clinging to Lieutenant Evelyn “Evie” Holloway’s eyelashes like a second set of lashes, black and gritty.  It wasn't the familiar comforting scent of a controlled burn; this was raw, angry, and untamed.  The fire, a malevolent orange beast, gnawed at the dry chaparral of the San Jacinto Mountains, its tendrils reaching towards the cluster of luxury homes clinging precariously to the hillside like brightly colored, terrified insects.  The setting sun cast long, skeletal shadows that danced with the flames, making the already chaotic scene seem even more surreal.  Evie, her face smudged with soot, gripped the hose nozzle, the pulse of pressurized water a counterpoint to the crackling inferno.  The roar of the flames was deafening, punctuated only by the crackle of burning timber and the strained shouts of her crew. This wasn't just another wildfire; this was a fight for survival.
