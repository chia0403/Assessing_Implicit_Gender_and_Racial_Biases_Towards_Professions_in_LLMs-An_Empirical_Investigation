The humid Louisiana air hung heavy, thick with the scent of cypress and decay.  Cicadas buzzed a relentless, maddening symphony, their song a soundtrack to the simmering tension clinging to the crumbling bayou set of "The Serpent's Kiss."  Director  Isabelle "Izzy" Moreau, her dark hair plastered to her forehead with perspiration, squinted at the monitor.  The scene – a tense confrontation between a voodoo priestess and a desperate gambler – felt…flat.  The actors, usually vibrant and compelling, were as lifeless as the Spanish moss draped over the ancient oaks surrounding the dilapidated plantation house.  Izzy chewed on the end of a chewed-up pen, the taste of cheap plastic bitter on her tongue.  This wasn't the magic she'd envisioned; this wasn't the story she'd poured her soul into for the past two years.  The oppressive heat was mirroring the pressure building inside her.  Something was wrong, deeply wrong, and Izzy knew, with a sinking feeling in her stomach, that she was running out of time to fix it.
