The biting wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorneâ€™s hair across her face, stinging her cheeks a vibrant crimson that mirrored the setting sun bleeding across the Alaskan sky.  It was a breathtaking, brutal beauty, the kind that Amelia, a landscape photographer with a penchant for the dramatic, lived for.  She hunched deeper into her thick parka, the icy breath misting before her as she adjusted the tripod supporting her Hasselblad.  Below her, the Chugach Mountains, jagged teeth against the darkening canvas of the sky, were cloaked in a fresh layer of snow, the untouched white punctuated by the deep indigo shadows of the encroaching night.  Tonight, however, the breathtaking view was secondary to the far more elusive prize Amelia sought: the aurora borealis, a celestial dance she'd chased across continents for the past five years, a phantom light show that only rarely revealed itself in all its glory.
