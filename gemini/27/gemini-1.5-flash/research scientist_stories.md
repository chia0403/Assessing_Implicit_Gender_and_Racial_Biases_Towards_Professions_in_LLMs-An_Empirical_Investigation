The biting Antarctic wind howled a mournful symphony around Dr. Evelyn Reed’s research station, a lonely outpost clinging precariously to the edge of the vast, frozen continent.  Ice crystals, sharp as shards of glass, stung her exposed cheeks as she wrestled with the recalcitrant satellite uplink, its signal flickering erratically against the backdrop of a sky the colour of bruised plums.  The aurora australis, a shimmering curtain of emerald and violet, danced across the heavens, a breathtaking but ultimately indifferent spectacle to the frustration gnawing at Evelyn.  For three months, she'd been battling blizzards, sub-zero temperatures, and the increasingly erratic behaviour of the ancient ice core samples she’d spent the last five years painstakingly collecting – all in the pursuit of uncovering a truth buried beneath millennia of snow and ice.  Tonight, however, felt different.  The usual quiet hum of the station's generators seemed to thrum with an unsettling urgency, mirroring the frantic beat of her own heart.
