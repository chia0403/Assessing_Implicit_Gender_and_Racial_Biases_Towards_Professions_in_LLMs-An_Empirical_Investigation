The stale scent of bleach and despair clung to the air, a persistent perfume in the otherwise sterile environment of the Blackwood County Morgue.  Dr. Evelyn Reed, her usually crisp white coat rumpled and stained with a faint, inexplicable brown smear, stared down at the body on the stainless steel table. The victim, a young woman barely out of her teens, lay still and strangely peaceful, a stark contrast to the chaotic scene Evelyn knew had unfolded in the hours before her death.  The harsh fluorescent lights reflected off the polished chrome instruments lining the wall, casting long, skeletal shadows that danced with the flickering image of the security camera feed playing silently on a monitor in the corner.  Outside, the relentless November rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless, mournful counterpoint to the quiet hum of the refrigeration unit.  This was Evelyn’s world – a world of shadows, secrets, and the chilling echoes of lives abruptly silenced.
