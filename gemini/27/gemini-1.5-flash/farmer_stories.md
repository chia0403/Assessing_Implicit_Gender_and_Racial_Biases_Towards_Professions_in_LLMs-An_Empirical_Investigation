The sun, a bruised plum hanging low in the western sky, cast long shadows across Elias Thorne's weathered face.  Dust, the fine, ochre dust of the Arizona desert, clung to his eyelashes and the worn brim of his Stetson.  He squinted, the setting sun painting the jagged peaks of the Superstition Mountains in hues of fiery orange and deep violet.  The air, thick with the scent of creosote and the faint, sweet tang of mesquite blossoms, hung heavy and still.  Elias Thorne, his calloused hands resting on the worn wood of his porch railing, watched the last sliver of sunlight disappear behind the mountains, a familiar ache settling in his bones – the ache of a life lived under the relentless Arizona sun, a life inextricably bound to the parched earth that both sustained and challenged him.  His farm, a stubborn patch of green clinging to the edge of the desert, lay silent except for the occasional chirping of crickets – a stark contrast to the vibrant chaos of the day's work.
