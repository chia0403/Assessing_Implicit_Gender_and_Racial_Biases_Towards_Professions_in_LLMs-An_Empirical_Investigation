The flickering fluorescent lights of Northwood High hummed a discordant tune, a soundtrack to Dr. Eleanor Vance’s increasingly frayed nerves.  Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of her office, blurring the already indistinct cityscape into a watercolour smear of grey.  The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and teenage angst, a familiar perfume Eleanor had come to associate with the twilight hours of a particularly challenging Friday.  A half-eaten granola bar sat abandoned on her desk, a testament to a lunch hastily consumed amidst a cascade of crisis calls and scheduling conflicts.  Tonight, however, felt different.  The usual adolescent drama—bullying reports, anxieties about exams, the simmering resentments that bubbled beneath the surface of high school life—had been eclipsed by something far more unsettling.  A whispered rumour, a frantic phone call from a teacher, a chilling note slipped anonymously into her mailbox: all pointed towards a darkness lurking within the halls of Northwood, a darkness that threatened to unravel the carefully constructed facade of normalcy.
