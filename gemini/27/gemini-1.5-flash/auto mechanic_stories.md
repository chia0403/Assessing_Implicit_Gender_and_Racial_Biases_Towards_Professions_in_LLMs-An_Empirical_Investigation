The greasy scent of motor oil clung to Elias Thorne like a second skin, a familiar perfume he'd worn since he was a boy, helping his father wrench on engines in their cramped, family-owned garage. Now, twenty years later, Elias owned Thorne's Auto Repair, a slightly larger, but still distinctly humble, establishment tucked away on the edge of Harmony Creek, a town so small the only excitement came from the occasional escaped cow from Farmer McGregor's pasture.  The late afternoon sun, already dipping below the hazy horizon, cast long shadows across the cracked asphalt of the driveway, highlighting the dust motes dancing in the single bare bulb hanging over Elias' workbench.  The rhythmic *thump-thump* of a worn-out engine, currently under Elias's expert care, provided the soundtrack to the quiet, almost sleepy, town.
