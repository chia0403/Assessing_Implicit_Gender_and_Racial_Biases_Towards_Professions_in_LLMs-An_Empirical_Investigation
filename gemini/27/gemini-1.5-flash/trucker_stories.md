The battered chrome of Ezekiel "Zeke" Stone's Peterbilt, affectionately nicknamed "The Iron Lung," glinted under the bruised purple of a Wyoming sunset.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of red earth, danced across the desolate expanse of I-80, their whirling silhouettes mirroring the turmoil churning within Zeke himself.  The air, thin and crisp with the bite of approaching winter, carried the scent of sagebrush and diesel fumes, a familiar perfume that had clung to Zeke's clothes and soul for the past twenty years.  Ahead, the jagged peaks of the Medicine Bow Mountains clawed at the fading light, their snow-dusted summits a stark contrast to the flat, unforgiving landscape he traversed.  His CB radio crackled with static, a lonely counterpoint to the rhythmic hum of his engine, a sound as familiar as his own heartbeat.  Tonight, however, the silence felt heavier, more oppressive than usual.  Something feltâ€¦off.
