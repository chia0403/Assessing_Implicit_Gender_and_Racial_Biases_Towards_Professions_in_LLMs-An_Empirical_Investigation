The flickering neon sign of the "Rusty Sprocket Diner" cast a sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked streets of Havenwood, a town clinging precariously to the edge of the whispering pines.  Water streamed from the eaves of the buildings, mirroring the relentless downpour that had been hammering the town for three days straight.

Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne, a woman whose calloused hands belied a surprisingly delicate touch with wiring, sat nursing a lukewarm cup, her brow furrowed in concentration as she stared at a circuit diagram spread across the sticky Formica tabletop.  The diagram, a chaotic mess of lines and symbols, represented the electrical system of Havenwood's oldest and most notoriously haunted house, Blackwood Manor.  Amy wasn't just an electrician; she was the town's only electrician, and tonight, she was facing her biggest challenge yet.
