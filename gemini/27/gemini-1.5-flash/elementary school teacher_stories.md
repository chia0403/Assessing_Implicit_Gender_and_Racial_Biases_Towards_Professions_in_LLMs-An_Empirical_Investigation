The chipped paint of Mrs. Eleanor Vance’s classroom desk flaked onto the worn copy of "Charlotte's Web" resting on its surface, a miniature snowstorm mirroring the one raging outside.  November in Ashwood, Vermont, was rarely kind, and this year was proving particularly brutal.  Wind howled like a banshee, rattling the old windows of Ashwood Elementary, a building that had weathered more storms – both literal and metaphorical – than Eleanor cared to remember.  The scent of woodsmoke and wet wool hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma that did little to soothe the knot of anxiety tightening in her stomach.  This wasn't just any snowstorm; the power had flickered and died an hour ago, plunging the school, and consequently, her twenty-four fifth-graders, into a sudden, unexpected darkness.
