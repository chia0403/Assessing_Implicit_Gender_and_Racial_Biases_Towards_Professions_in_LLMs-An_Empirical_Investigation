The rasp of granite against steel echoed through the cavernous workshop, a sound as familiar to Elias Thorne as the beat of his own heart.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single, grime-coated window high in the north wall, danced in the shafts of pale winter light.  Elias, his hands calloused and stained the ochre of the local sandstone, meticulously worked a chisel, freeing a delicate vein of quartz from a block of grey granite almost as tall as he was.  The air hung thick with the scent of wet stone and woodsmoke â€“ the lingering aroma of the forge that sat silently in the corner, awaiting the next piece to be shaped. Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune across the bleak, windswept moors of Dartmoor, a counterpoint to the rhythmic scrape of Elias's tools, a constant reminder of the unforgiving nature of the land that both sustained and challenged him.
