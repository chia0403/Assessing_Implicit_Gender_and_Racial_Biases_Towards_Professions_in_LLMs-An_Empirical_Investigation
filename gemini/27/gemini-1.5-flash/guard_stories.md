The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of Eldoria, stinging Seraphina “Sera” Valerius’s cheeks as raw as the exposed earth itself.  Her breath plumed out in ghostly white clouds, momentarily obscuring the flickering torchlight that barely illuminated the crumbling watchtower where she stood guard.  The tower, once a proud sentinel overlooking the vast, windswept plains, now leaned precariously, its stonework scarred by centuries of harsh weather and the occasional, more violent, assault from raiders.  Below, the sprawling, haphazard settlement of Oakhaven huddled like a frightened animal, its meager fires casting a feeble glow against the encroaching darkness.  Sera, wrapped in her heavy wool cloak, adjusted the grip on her spear, its iron point glinting faintly in the dying light.  The night was old, and the silence, broken only by the mournful howl of the wind, felt heavy with unspoken dread.
