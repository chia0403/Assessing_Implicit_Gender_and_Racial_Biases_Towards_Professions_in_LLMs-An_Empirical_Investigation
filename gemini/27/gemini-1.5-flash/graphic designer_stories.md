The chipped mug warmed Amelia Hernandez’s hands, the lukewarm chamomile doing little to soothe the churning in her stomach.  Rain lashed against the panoramic window of her Soho apartment, blurring the already hazy cityscape into a watercolour wash of greys and inky blacks.  Amelia, a graphic designer with a penchant for bold colours and even bolder coffee, found herself strangely drawn to the muted palette outside.  It mirrored the muted despair creeping into her own creative well.  The deadline for the Peterson & Sons rebranding loomed – a project so monumentally dull it threatened to suck the very lifeblood from her artistic soul.  The sleek, minimalist apartment, usually a sanctuary of creative chaos, felt suffocatingly sterile, a testament to the creative block that had settled over her like a persistent, damp fog.
