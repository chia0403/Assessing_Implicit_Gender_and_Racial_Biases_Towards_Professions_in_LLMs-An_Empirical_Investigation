The flickering fluorescent lights of the Blackwood Academy gymnasium hummed a discordant tune, mirroring the erratic rhythm of Elias Thorne's heart.  Dust motes, illuminated like tiny, glittering stars in the cavernous space, danced in the weak currents of air stirred by his slow, methodical sweeping.

Tonight, the usual quiet hum of the building feltâ€¦ different.  Heavier.  A silence so profound it pressed against his eardrums, broken only by the rhythmic swish of his broom and the distant, almost imperceptible drip, drip, drip of a leaky pipe somewhere in the bowels of the ancient structure.  Blackwood Academy, a gothic monstrosity of crumbling brick and shadowed corners, held its breath, and Elias Thorne, its solitary night watchman, felt it holding him too.
