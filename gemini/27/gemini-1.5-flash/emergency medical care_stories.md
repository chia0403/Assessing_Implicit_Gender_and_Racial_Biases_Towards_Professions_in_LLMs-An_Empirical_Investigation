The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Amy” Hernandez’s hair across her face as she wrestled the stretcher into the back of the ambulance.  Rain, driven horizontally by the gale, plastered her already damp uniform to her skin. The flashing red and blue lights of the vehicle reflected in the slick, asphalt sheen of the city streets, painting the surrounding buildings in an eerie, strobe-lit glow.  This wasn’t the picturesque postcard version of Boston; this was the gritty, unforgiving underbelly, a labyrinth of narrow alleyways and crumbling brick buildings clinging precariously to the Charles River’s edge.  The air, thick with the smell of salt, exhaust fumes, and something vaguely acrid that Amy couldn’t quite place, hinted at the unpredictable nature of her job tonight.  She adjusted her headlamp, its beam cutting through the gloom, illuminating a world where sirens were a soundtrack and life hung precariously in the balance.
