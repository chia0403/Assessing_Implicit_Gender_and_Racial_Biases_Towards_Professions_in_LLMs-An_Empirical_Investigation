The fluorescent lights of the drafting room hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Elias Thorne’s pencil on the mylar sheet.  Dust motes, illuminated by the harsh glare, danced in the stagnant air above his head, each a tiny, fleeting universe reflecting the vast, intricate blueprint spread before him.  The air itself smelled faintly of stale coffee, overripe bananas, and the peculiar, almost medicinal scent of the drafting film itself – a smell Elias, after twenty years at Archimedes & Sons Architectural Design, had come to associate intimately with the quiet, demanding rhythm of his life.  Outside, the relentless Chicago wind howled a mournful song against the tall, gothic windows, a stark contrast to the hushed, almost reverent atmosphere within the hallowed halls of the firm.  Elias, hunched over his drafting board, a half-eaten tuna sandwich perched precariously on a stack of blueprints, was oblivious to the storm raging beyond the glass.  His world, for now, was contained within the precise lines and meticulously rendered details of the new city hall annex.
