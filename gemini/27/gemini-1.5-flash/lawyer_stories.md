The chipped paint of the fire escape flaked onto Amelia Katherine Hayes's crisp white blouse, a fitting metaphor for the crumbling case she was about to tackle.  Below, the humid New Orleans air hung heavy and thick, a damp blanket clinging to the wrought-iron balconies and overflowing garbage cans of the French Quarter.  The scent of beignets fought a losing battle against the pervasive aroma of decay and desperation that permeated the narrow, shadowed alleyway where she stood, a lone figure silhouetted against the neon glow of a voodoo shop across the street.  Amelia, a lawyer whose sharp intellect was only matched by her impeccable sense of style (even if that style was currently threatened by falling paint), adjusted her silk scarf and braced herself for the night ahead.  The air crackled with the promise of something dark and dangerous, a feeling as familiar to her as the bitter taste of lukewarm coffee in the morning.
