The chipped paint of the classroom’s jungle mural flaked onto the worn carpet, a miniature rainforest falling on Ms. Eleanor Vance’s already chaotic day.  It was a Tuesday, the Tuesday after the particularly sticky incident involving glitter glue and a surprisingly ambitious attempt to recreate the Sistine Chapel ceiling (using only tiny, inexplicably sticky, hand-shaped sponges).  Sunlight slanted through the grimy windowpanes, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air like miniature, mischievous fairies – fairies far less manageable than the twenty-five five-year-olds currently vying for her attention.  The air hung thick with the scent of Crayola, slightly spoiled milk, and a persistent undercurrent of something akin to desperation, a scent Ms. Vance had come to associate intimately with her chosen profession.  Outside, the relentless New York City hum pulsed a steady, low-frequency drone, a comforting counterpoint to the high-pitched symphony of childhood within her four walls.
