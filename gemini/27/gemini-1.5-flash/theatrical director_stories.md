The chipped porcelain teacup trembled in Anya Petrova’s hand, mirroring the tremor of anxiety in her chest.  Rain lashed against the tall, gothic windows of her rehearsal space, a former church hall in the decaying grandeur of Prague’s Žižkov district.  The air hung thick with the scent of damp stone, stale beer, and the faint, lingering perfume of lilies – a testament to the last production, a disastrously romantic interpretation of *Faust* that had closed three weeks earlier to a chorus of polite coughs and empty seats.  Anya, a woman whose fiery red hair seemed to perpetually defy gravity as much as her ambitious theatrical visions, stared out at the cavernous space.  Empty chairs, draped in dust sheets, faced a makeshift stage cluttered with the discarded props of past failures: a rusty halberd, a chipped cherub, and a surprisingly lifelike rubber rat.  Tonight, however, the rat held no symbolism. Tonight, Anya was just tired.  The weight of her next production, a radical reimagining of *The Cherry Orchard* set in a crumbling post-communist factory, pressed down on her like the Prague sky.
