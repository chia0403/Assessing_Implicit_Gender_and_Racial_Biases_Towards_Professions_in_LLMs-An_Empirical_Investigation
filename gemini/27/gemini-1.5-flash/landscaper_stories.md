The dawn mist clung to the manicured lawns of Ashwood Estates like a gauzy shroud, clinging to the dew-laden roses and spider-webbing across the perfectly-shaped hedges.  Amelia “Mia” Hawthorne, her breath puffing white clouds in the crisp autumn air, surveyed her domain.  Not quite a kingdom, but close.  For Mia, the sprawling lawns of Ashwood, each a canvas of green and gold, represented more than just work; they were a testament to her artistry, her patience, and her deep-seated love for the earth.  The scent of damp leaves and freshly cut grass filled her lungs, a familiar and comforting perfume that chased away the lingering chill of the morning.  Today, however, a different scent, a sharp, metallic tang, pricked at her nostrils, a dissonant note in the symphony of autumn.  It hung heavy in the air, clinging to the dew, and Mia knew, with a sinking feeling, that something was terribly wrong.
