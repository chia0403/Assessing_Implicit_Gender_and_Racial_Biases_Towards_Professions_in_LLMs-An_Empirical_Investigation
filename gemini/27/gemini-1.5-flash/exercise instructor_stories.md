The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of sweat and chlorine, clinging to Amelia Grace Hawthorne like a second skin.  Amelia, or "Amy" as her clients insisted on calling her – much to her professional chagrin – adjusted the microphone clipped to her neon-pink sports bra.  The Aqua-Fit studio shimmered under the sodium-vapor lamps, a kaleidoscope of turquoise tiles reflecting the rhythmic splashing of twenty-odd bodies in the heated pool.  Tonight was her most popular class, "Aqua-Burn," a ferocious hour of water-based calisthenics designed to sculpt and tone, leaving even the most seasoned athletes gasping for breath.  The air crackled with anticipation, a potent blend of nervous energy and the faint, almost imperceptible, scent of expensive sunscreen.  This wasn't just a fitness class; it was Amelia's kingdom, a meticulously crafted domain of sculpted muscles and sculpted egos.  Tonight, however, something felt…off.  A subtle shift in the usual energetic hum of the room, a disquiet that settled in her stomach like a cold stone.
