Bleakstone Lane itself was a contradiction â€“ a sliver of sun-drenched charm stubbornly clinging to the grimy underbelly of Grimsborough, a city that choked on its own ambition.  Ivy, thick as a man's arm, clawed at the crumbling brick walls of the surrounding buildings, a stark contrast to the pristine white apron Elias wore, meticulously starched and spotless.  Rain, a Grimsborough staple, pattered softly against the bakery's aged windowpanes, blurring the already indistinct gaslight glow that spilled from the neighboring pub, "The Drunken Dragon."  Inside, the warmth was a welcome respite, the clatter of Elias's whisk a comforting rhythm against the city's relentless hum.
