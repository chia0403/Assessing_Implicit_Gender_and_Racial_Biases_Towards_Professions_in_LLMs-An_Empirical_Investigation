The scent of acetone and lavender hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Seraphina “Sera” Bellweather.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single, bare bulb hanging above her work station, danced in the twilight that had begun to settle over the small, cluttered salon.  Sera, her nimble fingers still stained a vibrant fuchsia from a client’s ill-fated attempt at a DIY ombre, carefully swept stray glitter from the worn, vinyl floor.  Outside, the rhythmic thrum of the city’s late-afternoon traffic offered a muted counterpoint to the soft click-clack of her nail file.  This wasn't exactly the glamorous life she'd imagined, nestled between a failing bakery and a locksmith with a penchant for arguing with pigeons, but "Nails by Sera" was hers, and that, for now, was enough.  The chipped paint on the walls, the slightly sticky floor, even the perpetually-off-kilter sign above the door – they were all testaments to her resilience, to her quiet determination to make this tiny space her own.
