The biting Antarctic wind whipped at Dr. Evelyn Reed's parka, stinging her exposed cheeks despite the thick layers of protective gear.  The sun, a pale disc hanging low in the perpetual twilight of early spring, cast long, distorted shadows across the jagged ice formations surrounding McMurdo Station.  Evelyn, her breath clouding in the frigid air, adjusted the thermal imaging camera mounted on its tripod, its lens pointed towards a newly discovered chasm that stretched deeper into the Ross Ice Shelf than any previously recorded.  A shiver ran down her spine, a combination of cold and anticipation.  This chasm, according to her research, held the key to understanding a rapidly melting section of the ice shelf, a mystery that had plagued the scientific community for the last decade, and Evelyn held the perilous task of unraveling it.
