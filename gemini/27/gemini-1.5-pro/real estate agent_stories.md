The crisp October air nipped at Juliana "Jules" Ramirez's cheeks as she stood on the porch of 17 Hemlock Lane, fiddling with the lockbox.  Fallen leaves, the color of burnt orange and rusty red, carpeted the expansive lawn, whispering secrets with every gust of wind that rustled through the towering oak trees. Hemlock Lane was the epitome of quaint New England charm: cobblestone driveways, meticulously manicured hedges, and houses that looked plucked from a Norman Rockwell painting.  Number 17, however, was a different story.  While the surrounding homes exuded warmth and welcome, this one hunched back from the road, shrouded in overgrown ivy and an air of neglect.  Jules, a seasoned real estate agent with Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices, had seen her fair share of fixer-uppers, but this one feltâ€¦ different.  There was a stillness about the place, a heavy silence that pressed against her like a physical weight. This wasn't just a house in need of some TLC; this house had a story to tell, and Jules had a feeling it wasn't a happy one.
