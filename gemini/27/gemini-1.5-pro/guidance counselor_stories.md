Rain lashed against the arched windows of Mrs. Evelyn Ainsworth's office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside sixteen-year-old Noah Peterson.  He sat hunched in the uncomfortable orange chair, picking at a loose thread on his threadbare jeans.  Evelynâ€™s office, nestled in the far corner of Northwood High, was a carefully constructed haven.  Sunlight usually streamed through the aforementioned windows, illuminating shelves packed with college brochures and self-help books with titles like "Unlocking Your Potential" and "Finding Your Path."  Today, however, the grey November sky cast long shadows across the room, giving the inspirational posters a strangely ominous air.  Northwood, a sprawling brick building clinging to the edge of the small, logging town of Timber Creek, Oregon, felt particularly isolated in the downpour, cut off from the rest of the world by the dense, rain-soaked forest pressing in on all sides. This isolation, normally a source of quiet charm for Evelyn, today felt stifling, echoing the weight of the silence hanging heavy between her and the troubled boy before her.
