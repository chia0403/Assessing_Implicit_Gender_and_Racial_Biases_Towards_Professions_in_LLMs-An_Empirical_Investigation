Rain lashed against the gothic windows of the Grimstone Building, mimicking the frantic drumming of Amelia Hayes' fingers against her worn mahogany desk.  The wind howled, a mournful cry that seemed to seep through the very stone of the ancient structure, rattling the leaded glass panes. Amelia, a paralegal at the prestigious (and notoriously eccentric) law firm of Blackwood, Thorne & Grimstone, shivered, pulling her threadbare cardigan tighter around her.  It was almost 7pm on a Friday night in late October, and the rest of the firm had long since fled for the weekend, leaving Amelia alone in the cavernous, dimly lit office.  The only illumination came from her desk lamp and the flickering gaslights in the hallway, casting long, dancing shadows that stretched and distorted familiar shapes into grotesque parodies.  Tonight’s task:  locate a misplaced file, critical to the firm’s biggest case, due in court on Monday.  A misplaced file that, according to Mr. Blackwood himself, contained the smoking gun. A misplaced file that, if not found, could cost Amelia her job.
