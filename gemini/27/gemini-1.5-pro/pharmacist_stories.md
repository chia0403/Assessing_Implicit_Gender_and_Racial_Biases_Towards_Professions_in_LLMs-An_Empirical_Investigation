The bell above the door of Apothecary & Anodyne jingled merrily, a discordant counterpoint to the thrumming headache pounding behind Dr. Elias Thorne's eyes.  Rain lashed against the large, bay windows, blurring the view of the gas-lit cobbled streets of Hollow Creek, a town nestled deep within the mist-shrouded valleys of the Welsh countryside. November had arrived with a vengeance, bringing with it not only icy winds and perpetual drizzle, but a peculiar unease that settled over the town like a damp shroud. Elias, his starched white coat clinging slightly to his frame, rubbed his temples and sighed. He’d been expecting a delivery of feverfew and valerian root for days, and his dwindling stock was making him increasingly anxious. The townsfolk of Hollow Creek relied on his remedies, and with the strange malady spreading through the valley, his services were more vital than ever.  The air in the small apothecary, usually redolent with the comforting scents of dried herbs and tinctures, was thick with a cloying sweetness that Elias couldn’t quite place.  It smelled, oddly, of overripe plums and something faintly metallic, like the scent of old pennies.
