The flickering fluorescent lights of the Zenith Laboratories sub-basement buzzed like trapped insects, casting long, skeletal shadows across the polished concrete floor.  The air hung thick with the cloying sweetness of disinfectant, battling the underlying metallic tang that permeated everything in the building.  It was 3:17 am, the quietest hour, and Elias Thorne, pushing his mop bucket across the deserted corridor, felt a familiar, if somewhat melancholy, sense of ownership over this sterile, subterranean world.  Tonight, however, the quiet was different. It was a brittle quiet, stretched taut like a wire about to snap.  A single drop of something dark and viscous splattered onto the pristine floor a few feet ahead of Elias, followed by another, and another, each one a stark punctuation mark in the oppressive silence.
