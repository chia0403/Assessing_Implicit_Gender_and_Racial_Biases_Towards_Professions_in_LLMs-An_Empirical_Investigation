The rain hammered against the arched window of Dr. Eleanor Vance’s office, blurring the already fading light of the late November afternoon.  Her office, nestled on the second floor of a converted Victorian house in the heart of Ashwood, Oregon, usually felt warm and inviting, a sanctuary filled with the scent of jasmine tea and the soft glow of a Himalayan salt lamp. Today, however, the storm raging outside seemed to seep into the very bones of the old building, bringing with it a palpable sense of unease. Eleanor, her dark auburn hair pulled back in a loose knot, tapped a pen against her leather-bound notebook, the rhythmic sound a counterpoint to the relentless drumming of the rain. The last client of the day, a young man wrestling with crippling anxiety, had just left, leaving behind a lingering silence heavier than the storm itself.  Ashwood, usually a picture-postcard town known for its vibrant arts scene and close-knit community, had been experiencing a string of unsettling incidents over the past few months, a darkness creeping into its idyllic facade that Eleanor couldn’t quite shake off.  She had a feeling the storm outside was just a prelude to something more…something bigger.
