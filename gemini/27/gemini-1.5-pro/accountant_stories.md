The damp chill of a November fog clung to the cobbled streets of Edinburgh, seeping through the ill-fitting window frames of Amelia Grace Hawthorne's office.  Amelia, a chartered accountant known for her meticulous nature and even more meticulous fringe, tapped a perfectly manicured nail against a stack of invoices. Her office, nestled above a purveyor of fine Scottish whiskies on Canongate, was a testament to organised chaos.  Ledgers balanced precariously atop dusty tomes on accounting principles, while half-eaten shortbread tins vied for space with overflowing file boxes.  Beyond the window, the floodlights of Edinburgh Castle painted the swirling mist a spectral orange, a stark contrast to the pale glow of Ameliaâ€™s desk lamp, which illuminated a single, unsettling discrepancy in the MacIntyre Distillery's quarterly accounts. A discrepancy that hinted at something far more complicated than a misplaced decimal point.
