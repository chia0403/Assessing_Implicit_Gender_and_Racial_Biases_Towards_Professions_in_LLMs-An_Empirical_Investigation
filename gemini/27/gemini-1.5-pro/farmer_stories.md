The wind, sharp and smelling of impending rain, whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s braid across her face as she surveyed the furrowed expanse of Hawthorne Farm.  The low, slate-grey clouds mirrored the colour of the freshly ploughed earth, stretching out from the weathered farmhouse to the jagged peaks of the Dragon’s Tooth mountains in the distance.  October had arrived in the valley of Oakhaven, painting the lower slopes of the mountains in vibrant hues of crimson and gold, a stark contrast to the somber greys dominating Amelia’s immediate world.  The air, usually crisp and invigorating this time of year, carried a heavy, almost oppressive humidity that promised a downpour before nightfall.  A lone crow perched atop the scarecrow guarding the north field, its caw a harsh punctuation mark in the otherwise quiet landscape.  Harvest was just a week away, and everything, from the rustling leaves of the ancient oak by the well to the nervous twitch in Amelia’s eye, hinted at the change that was about to sweep over Oakhaven.
