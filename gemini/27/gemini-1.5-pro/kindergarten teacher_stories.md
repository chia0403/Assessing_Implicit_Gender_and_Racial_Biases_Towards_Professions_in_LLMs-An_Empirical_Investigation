The aroma of stale apple juice and dried Play-Doh hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume that clung to Miss Eleanor Ainsworth like glitter glue.  Sunlight, filtered through the smudged windows of Room 2B at Sunny Meadow Elementary, illuminated a chaotic landscape of miniature chairs overturned, construction paper scraps scattered like confetti, and a lone, slightly deflated red balloon clinging stubbornly to the ceiling fan.  It was 5:30 pm, the cacophony of tiny voices replaced by a humming silence, broken only by the rhythmic tick-tock of the ladybug-shaped clock above the coat hooks. Eleanor, her auburn hair escaping its messy bun, knelt beside a lopsided tower of brightly coloured blocks, a faint smile playing on her lips. It was Friday, the end of another week in the vibrant, occasionally volatile world of kindergarten, and she wouldn't have traded it for anything.  Outside, the crisp autumn air hinted at the changing season, but inside Room 2B, it felt like perpetual springtime, a constant cycle of growth, discovery, and the occasional glitter explosion.
