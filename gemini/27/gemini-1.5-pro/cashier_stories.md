The fluorescent lights of the Quick Stop hummed a monotonous B-flat, a soundtrack to Amelia Reyes's Tuesday afternoon.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the neon glow of the gas pumps outside. Inside, the air hung thick with the commingled scents of stale coffee, hot dogs rotating endlessly on a metal spit, and the faintly chemical tang of cleaning fluid Amelia had used just minutes ago to wipe down the counter. The Quick Stop, perched precariously on the edge of Highway 17 just outside the sleepy town of Harmony Creek, Oregon, wasn't glamorous, but it paid the bills. And for Amelia, right now, that was enough.
