The rusty clang of the meat hook echoed through "The Gilded Cleaver," a butcher shop squeezed between a laundromat perpetually venting lavender-scented steam and a pawn shop with a perpetually flickering neon sign.  November wind howled down Bleaker Street, rattling the shop's frosted glass windows, painted with a cartoon pig giving a jaunty thumbs-up. Inside, amidst the sawdust-dusted floor and the hanging carcasses that swayed like morbid dancers, Elias Thorne, his apron smeared with crimson, sharpened his cleaver with a practiced hand. The blade gleamed, a cold, sharp contrast to the warmth radiating from the pot-bellied stove in the corner.  Elias, a man built like an oak tree with hands that could crush a walnut with ease, squinted at the edge, his breath puffing out in white clouds in the chilled air.  He was expecting a special delivery, a primal cut unlike any he'd seen before, and he needed his tools to be razor sharp.  Tonight, Elias Thorne wasn't just a butcher. He was about to become something much more.
