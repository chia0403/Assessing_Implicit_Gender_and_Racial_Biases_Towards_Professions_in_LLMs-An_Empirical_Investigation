The biting wind whipped at Amelia "Mia" Rodriguez's turnout coat as she stood on the precipice of the abandoned textile mill, flakes of rusty snow stinging her cheeks.  Beneath her feet, the old loading dock groaned, a symphony of decaying wood and protesting metal. Above, the bruised twilight sky bled into the smoky haze that choked the air, punctuated by the flickering orange glow from the inferno raging within the mill’s cavernous belly.  Pawtucket, Rhode Island, usually a quiet, almost sleepy town nestled along the Blackstone River, was tonight a tableau of chaos and flickering shadows.  Fire trucks lined the narrow street, their lights painting the surrounding brick buildings in alternating washes of red and blue.  Hoses snaked across the slick cobblestones, gurgling with the lifeblood fighting against the building's fiery demise.  The air, thick with the smell of burning cotton and damp wool, crackled with the shouted commands of Mia’s Captain and the rhythmic hiss of the water jets. This was Mia’s first major fire since transferring to Pawtucket Fire Department Station 3, and the churning in her stomach was a volatile mix of adrenaline and apprehension.  She knew the old mill like the back of her hand, having spent countless childhood hours exploring its dusty corners with her brother. Now, those familiar spaces were being consumed by a ravenous hunger, and it was her job, along with her crew, to tame it.
