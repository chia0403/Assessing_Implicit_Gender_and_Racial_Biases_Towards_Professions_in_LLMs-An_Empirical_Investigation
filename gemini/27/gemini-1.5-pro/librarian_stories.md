The biting November wind whipped around Eleanor Ainsworth's ankles as she unlocked the heavy oak doors of the Whisperwind Library.  Nestled between a perpetually closed antique shop and a bakery that smelled perpetually of burnt sugar, the library stood as a quiet sanctuary in the bustling heart of Oakhaven, Vermont.  Snow dusted the slate roof, and the gothic arch above the entrance framed a stained-glass window depicting a wise owl perched on a stack of books. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of aging paper and beeswax polish. Eleanor, bundled in a thick wool coat and a scarf the color of a robin's egg, stepped inside, the jingle of the bell above the door announcing her arrival to the silent rows of slumbering stories.  The only other light besides the weak winter sun filtering through the arched windows came from a single lamp illuminating the worn, mahogany circulation desk where Eleanor began her daily ritual of waking the library from its overnight slumber.
