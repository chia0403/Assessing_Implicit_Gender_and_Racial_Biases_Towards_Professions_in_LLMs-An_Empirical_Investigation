The wind whipped across the bleak, grey expanse of the Widowâ€™s Tooth quarry, biting at the exposed skin of Elias Thorne. He pulled his thick wool scarf tighter around his neck, the rough fabric scratching against the stubble of his unshaven jaw.  Grey dust, the fine powder of pulverized granite, swirled around him, coating his already dust-caked leather apron and clinging to the dampness in his eyelashes.  The Widow's Tooth, a jagged peak that loomed over the quarry like a skeletal finger pointing accusingly at the sky, cast a long, oppressive shadow across the terraced landscape.  Here, nestled amidst the harsh beauty of the Derbyshire Dales in the year 1888, Elias spent his days coaxing shapes from the unforgiving stone, a solitary figure against a backdrop of granite and grit.  This morning, however, the usual rhythm of his work was about to be broken.  A raven, black as the deepest vein of coal running through the earth beneath his feet, landed on the winch mechanism beside him, its obsidian eyes gleaming with an unsettling intelligence. It cawed once, a harsh, guttural sound that seemed to echo the silent scream of the stone itself.
