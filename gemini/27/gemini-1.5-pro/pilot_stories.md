The biting Alaskan wind whipped at Amelia "Mia" St. Clair's parka as she pre-flighted her Cessna 206.  The sun, a pale disc barely cresting the jagged peaks of the Wrangell Mountains, cast long, blue shadows across the frozen Denali Highway.  It was 6:00 am, twenty below zero, and Miaâ€™s breath crystallized in the air, forming fleeting, ephemeral sculptures.  Lake Louise, a vast expanse of ice this time of year, glittered beneath the nascent light, bordered by a dense forest of skeletal spruce trees.  Mia, her gloved fingers tracing the rivets on the wing strut, felt the familiar thrill of anticipation that always preceded a flight, even one as mundane as this cargo run to the remote mining outpost at Chistochina.  But something in the stillness of the morning, the almost unnatural quiet, prickled at the back of her neck.  It wasn't just the cold.  It felt like the wilderness itself was holding its breath.
