The bell above the door of "Nailed It," a tiny salon squeezed between a laundromat and a suspiciously empty storefront, jingled merrily, announcing the arrival of yet another desperate soul in need of a little pampering.  Elara Vivienne Dupres, her name embroidered in shimmering silver thread on her crisp white apron, sighed softly. It was a Tuesday afternoon in the sleepy, perpetually overcast town of Port Blossom, Oregon, and business, much like the sky above, was stubbornly grey.  The salon, usually humming with the whir of nail drills and the chatter of women swapping gossip, was eerily quiet.  Only the gentle gurgle of the fish tank in the corner, home to a single, lethargic goldfish named Finnegan, broke the silence. Elara leaned against the reception desk, tapping a perfectly manicured, scarlet-tipped finger against a chipped ceramic mermaid figurine. The salty sea air, thick with the scent of brine and distant rain, seeped in through the open door, carrying with it a hint of something else... something unsettling.
