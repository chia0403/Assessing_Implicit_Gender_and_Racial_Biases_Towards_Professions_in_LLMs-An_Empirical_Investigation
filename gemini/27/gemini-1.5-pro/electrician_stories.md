The biting November wind whipped around Elias Vance, tugging at the edges of his worn canvas jacket as he surveyed the dilapidated Victorian mansion.  Iron gates, rusted and groaning on their hinges, guarded the overgrown drive that snaked its way through gnarled, skeletal oak trees.  Fallen leaves, thick and damp, crunched beneath his heavy work boots.  Greyhaven Manor, the locals called it, though Elias suspected its original name was something far less ominous.  He’d been called out here – a rare weekday emergency call, no less – to fix a complete power outage. The elderly homeowner, a Mrs. Abernathy, had sounded frantic on the phone, babbling about flickering lights and a strange humming coming from the basement before the line went dead. Elias, ever the pragmatist, figured a blown transformer or a chewed-through wire was the culprit, not ghosts or goblins. Still, the unsettling quiet of the place, broken only by the rustling leaves and the distant caw of a crow, pricked at the hairs on the back of his neck.  He hefted his toolbox, its weight reassuringly familiar, and trudged towards the imposing front door, the stained-glass windows staring down like vacant eyes.
