The biting wind whipped across the desolate stretch of Highway 17, carrying with it the scent of pine needles and the low hum of distant traffic.  Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez, bundled in a fluorescent orange parka that swallowed her small frame, stamped her feet against the frozen asphalt. Dawn was just beginning to paint the eastern sky a bruised purple, but the air still held the deep chill of a late November morning in the Sierra Nevada mountains.  A string of flickering hazard lights, like a misplaced constellation, marked the section of road Amy and her crew were responsible for clearing.  A rockslide, triggered by the previous night’s freezing rain, had spilled a cascade of jagged boulders and loose gravel across both lanes, effectively cutting off access to the small mountain town of Cedar Creek. Amy tightened the straps of her hard hat and exhaled, a plume of white vapor disappearing into the frosty air. This wasn’t how she’d envisioned spending her Tuesday, but then again, life on the highway rarely went according to plan.
