Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Amelia “Amy” Hawthorne’s office, each drop a staccato note against the backdrop of a mournful saxophone solo drifting from the jazz club downstairs.  The flickering neon sign of the Blue Moon reflected in the puddles gathering on the fire escape, casting an eerie purplish glow across the room.  Amy, her trench coat still damp from the downpour, sat hunched over her desk, the harsh light of a gooseneck lamp illuminating a faded photograph of a smiling young woman with eyes that hinted at a hidden sadness.  The office, nestled above a pawn shop and a fortune teller on Bleaker Street, in the heart of Manhattan’s forgotten district, was a testament to her less-than-glamorous life as a private investigator.  Cigarette smoke hung thick in the air, a familiar comfort in the face of the gnawing uncertainty that came with her line of work.  The photograph in her hand, however, brought anything but comfort.  It was the reason her phone had rung at 3:00 am, the reason she was now staring into the abyss of another missing person case.
