The cab of the Peterbilt 379, christened "The Wanderer" in peeling gold script, rattled like a tin can full of angry wasps as it lumbered down Arizona State Route 89A.  Crimson cliffs, streaked with ochre and umber, rose on either side of the highway, swallowing the late afternoon sun and casting long, skeletal shadows across the asphalt.  Inside, Beatrice “Bea” Adelaide Thompson squinted against the glare reflecting off the hood, one hand on the wheel, the other drumming a restless rhythm against a faded dashboard Jesus bobblehead.  A half-eaten bag of  Spicy Sweet Chili Doritos lay crumpled on the passenger seat, a testament to the long, monotonous stretch between Flagstaff and Sedona.  Bea, her greying brown hair pulled back in a no-nonsense ponytail, chewed on the inside of her cheek, a habit formed over twenty years and countless miles of open road.  The dry Arizona air, heavy with the scent of pine and dust, whispered a promise of rain, a promise Bea knew from experience was rarely kept.  This run, hauling a load of pre-fabricated houses bound for a new development outside Prescott, was supposed to be routine.  But the unsettling quiet of the radio, coupled with the unnerving way the shadows danced in her peripheral vision, told Bea this trip might be anything but.
