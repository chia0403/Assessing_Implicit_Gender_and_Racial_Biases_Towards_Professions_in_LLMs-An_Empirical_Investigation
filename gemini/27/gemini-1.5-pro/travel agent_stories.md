The relentless Florida sun beat down on the turquoise awning of "Wanderlust Voyages," baking the pavement outside to a shimmering mirage. Inside, the air conditioning battled the oppressive heat with a valiant, if slightly wheezy, hum.  Amelia Grace Hawthorne, her name as elegant and evocative as the destinations she curated, sat perched behind a desk cluttered with brochures depicting sun-drenched beaches and snow-capped mountains.  A half-eaten key lime pie sat beside a stack of passport applications, a testament to her dedication to both work and the local delicacies.  The rhythmic click-clack of her keyboard punctuated the otherwise quiet afternoon, broken only by the occasional whir of the ceiling fan and the distant chime of the shop door announcing a new arrival.  This Wednesday, however, felt different. The air hung thick with a strange, anticipatory stillness, as if the very palm trees lining the street outside were holding their breath. Amelia, usually brimming with an infectious enthusiasm for her profession, felt a prickle of unease, a sense that the ordinary rhythm of her life was about to be irrevocably disrupted.
