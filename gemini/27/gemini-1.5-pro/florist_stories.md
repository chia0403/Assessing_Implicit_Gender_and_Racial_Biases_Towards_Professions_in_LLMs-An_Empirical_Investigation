Sunlight, struggling through the clouds, caught the prisms hanging in the window, scattering rainbows across the buckets overflowing with hydrangeas, lilies, and freesia.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and blooming jasmine, hinted at the secrets whispered between petals and thorns, secrets Eloise, with her uncanny ability to understand the language of flowers, was uniquely privy to.
