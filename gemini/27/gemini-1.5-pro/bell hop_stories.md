The revolving doors of the Grand Majestic Hotel whispered a constant sigh, a rhythm punctuated by the click of high heels on marble and the muted rumble of luggage wheels.  The year was 1929, and opulence hung in the air like expensive perfume.  Crystal chandeliers dripped with light, illuminating the vast lobby where potted palms stood sentinel and a jazz quartet played softly in the corner.  Amidst this whirlwind of wealth and whispered secrets, seventeen-year-old Elias Finch, his uniform cap perched precariously on his head, navigated the chaos with the practiced ease of a seasoned conductor.  His name tag, gleaming brass against the deep green of his jacket, announced his position: Bell Hop.  Tonight, however, Elias felt less like a conductor and more like a small boat tossed on a tempestuous sea.  The hotel, usually bustling, was overflowing, every room booked for the Vandergelt Gala, an event rumored to be the social highlight of the season.
