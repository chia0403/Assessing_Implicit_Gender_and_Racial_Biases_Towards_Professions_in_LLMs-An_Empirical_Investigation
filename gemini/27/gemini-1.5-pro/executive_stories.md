The rain hammered against the panoramic window of Amelia Reyes-Hernandez's forty-second-floor office, blurring the already fading lights of Chicago's skyline. Inside, the air crackled with a different kind of energy. Amelia, Chief Operating Officer of NovaTech Industries, a global leader in sustainable energy solutions, tapped a manicured nail against her polished mahogany desk.  The rhythmic tapping was the only outward sign of the storm brewing within her.  The elegantly appointed office, with its abstract art and sleek minimalist furniture, usually a sanctuary of calm and control, felt suffocating tonight. The scent of jasmine from the diffuser usually soothed her; tonight, it only amplified the tension coiling in her stomach.  A contract lay before her, its pages illuminated by the cool glow of her desk lamp, a contract that could either catapult NovaTech into a new era of prosperity or send it spiraling into ruin.
