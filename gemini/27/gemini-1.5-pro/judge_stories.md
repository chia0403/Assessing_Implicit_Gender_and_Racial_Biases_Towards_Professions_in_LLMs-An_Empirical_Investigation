The mahogany in Judge Cordelia Iris Thorne's chambers absorbed the weak November sun, radiating a dull, burnished glow. Outside, a persistent drizzle slicked the cobblestones of Old Town Alexandria, Virginia, turning the gaslights into hazy halos.  Rain lashed against the arched windows, a rhythmic counterpoint to the rhythmic tap-tap-tapping of Cordelia’s pen against the worn leather blotter on her desk.  The case files stacked before her, each a testament to a fractured life or a broken promise, seemed to exude the same damp chill permeating the air.  This particular Monday morning found her grappling with the sentencing of Elias Vance, a young man barely out of his teens, caught in the intricate web of an opioid ring. Cordelia’s heart, usually shielded by the impersonal pronouncements of the law, ached with a weariness that went beyond the simple exhaustion of long hours. The Vance case felt like a microcosm of a larger decay, a rot eating away at the heart of a community she had sworn to protect.
