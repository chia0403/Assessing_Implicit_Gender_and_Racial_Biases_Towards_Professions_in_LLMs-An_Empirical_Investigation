Outside, the relentless Oregon drizzle blurred the lights of passing cars into hazy streaks, reflecting the equally blurred lines between Amelia's sanity and the looming deadline.  Another client, late and frantic, burst through the door, scattering raindrops and apologies in their wake. Amelia sighed, pushing a stray strand of dark hair from her face.
