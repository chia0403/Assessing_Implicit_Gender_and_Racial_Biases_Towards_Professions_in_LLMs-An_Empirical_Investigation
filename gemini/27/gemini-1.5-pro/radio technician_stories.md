The biting November wind whipped across the desolate plains of eastern Wyoming, rattling the rusted weathervane atop the KWYR radio tower.  Inside the cramped, cluttered shack that served as both the station and Elias Vance Hollowayâ€™s home, the only sounds were the rhythmic hum of the transmitter and the crackling of static coming from a vintage Philco radio. Dust motes danced in the single beam of a bare bulb hanging precariously from the low ceiling.  Elias, a man of few words and even fewer comforts, hunched over a workbench littered with resistors, capacitors, and vacuum tubes, a soldering iron clutched in his calloused hand. The faint scent of burnt rosin filled the air, mingling with the ever-present aroma of stale coffee and something vaguely metallic that Elias had long since ceased to notice. Outside, the last sliver of sunset bled into the vast, darkening expanse, leaving behind the promise of a long, frigid night. The red "On Air" sign above the microphone cast a bloody glow on Elias's weathered face as he meticulously worked, oblivious to the encroaching darkness and the strange signal that was beginning to bleed through the usual static on the Philco.
