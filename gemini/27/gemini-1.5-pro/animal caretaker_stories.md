The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Amy” Hawthorne’s auburn braid across her face as she trudged across the frozen mud of the Sanctuary.  Dawn hadn't quite broken yet, the sky a bruised purple bleeding into a reluctant grey, but the residents of the Whispering Pines Primate Rescue were already stirring.

Amy inhaled the crisp air, a mixture of pine needles, damp earth, and something distinctly… simian.  It wasn’t an unpleasant smell, more of an earthy reminder of her purpose.  Her thick, fleece-lined jacket did little to ward off the chill, but the anticipation of seeing her charges – especially the newly arrived orangutan, Raja – warmed her from the inside out.
