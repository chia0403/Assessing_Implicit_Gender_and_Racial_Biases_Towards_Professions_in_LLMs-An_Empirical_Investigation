The biting November wind howled a mournful tune around the eaves of Blackwood Manor, rattling the ancient windowpanes in their frames.  Inside, where the air held the scent of beeswax and lemon oil, Elsie Mae Cartwright hummed a more cheerful melody as she polished the grand staircase's banister.  Blackwood Manor was a sprawling, gothic monstrosity perched on a cliff overlooking the churning grey sea.  Gargoyles leered from every corner, and ivy, thick as a man's arm, clung to the stone walls like a possessive lover. Elsie, however, had never been intimidated by the manor's gloomy grandeur.  She'd been its housekeeper for fifteen years, long enough to know its creaky floors, its drafty corridors, and the secrets whispered within its shadowed halls. Today, however, a different kind of silence hung in the air, a stillness that prickled the back of her neck and made the hairs on her arms stand on end. Mr. Blackwood, the manor's eccentric owner, was due back from his annual archaeological expedition, and Elsie had a feeling this year, he wouldn't be returning alone.
