Rain lashed against the stained-glass window depicting St. Jude, patron saint of lost causes, a fitting image given Elias Thorne’s current predicament. He sat in his cramped office, the air thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, a half-eaten tuna sandwich curling sadly on a paper plate.  His office, Thorne Insurance & Financial Planning, was tucked between a laundromat and a perpetually closed bakery on Bleaker Street in the grey, perpetually drizzling city of Hollow Creek, Oregon. Outside, the neon glow of the laundromat’s “OPEN 24 HRS” sign cast a lurid, flickering light across Elias’s rain-streaked window, painting St. Jude in alternating hues of sickly green and washed-out pink.  The only other illumination came from a flickering fluorescent light overhead that buzzed with the persistence of a trapped fly. Elias rubbed his tired eyes, the faint lines around them etched deeper by the harsh light, and stared at the overflowing ashtray on his desk.  He hadn't had a client in three weeks, and the rent was due.
