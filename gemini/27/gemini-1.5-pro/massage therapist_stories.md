The late afternoon sun, filtered through the rain-streaked windows of Serenity Now Massage Therapy, cast long shadows across the polished wooden floor.  Rain pattered against the glass, a soothing counterpoint to the gentle strains of panpipe music drifting from hidden speakers.  Eleanor Vance, her hands still faintly scented with lavender and bergamot from the last client, adjusted the thermostat a degree warmer.  The air held a lingering, comforting aroma, a blend of essential oils and the faintly medicinal scent of the liniment she used for deep tissue work.  Serenity Now, tucked between a bustling bakery and a laundromat in the heart of Old Town Ashworth, was Eleanor's sanctuary, her carefully curated escape from the chaos of the world.  Tonight, however, a different kind of chaos was brewing, and it had nothing to do with knotted muscles or stressed-out clients.
