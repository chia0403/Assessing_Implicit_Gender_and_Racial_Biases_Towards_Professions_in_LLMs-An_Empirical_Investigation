The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, carrying the scent of frozen fish and damp concrete as Dr. Elias Thorne adjusted his scarf.  The crimson neon sign of his practice, "Thorne Chiropractic & Wellness," buzzed faintly above the frosted glass of the front door. It cast a sickly sweet glow over the sparsely populated street of aging brick buildings in Rogers Park, Chicago. Inside, the waiting room, usually bustling with stiff-necked office workers and aching athletes, was eerily empty. It was 7:55 am on a Tuesday, the coldest day of the year so far, and Elias was already regretting his decision to open the clinic.  The only sound was the rhythmic tick-tock of a vintage clock his grandmother had left him, a sound that usually brought him comfort but today seemed to amplify the silence. He rubbed his hands together, trying to generate some warmth, a knot of unease tightening in his stomach.  Something feltâ€¦off.
