The wind, sharp and smelling of impending snow, whipped across the vast expanse of the Chisholm Ranch, tugging at the brim of Jedediah "Jed" Chisholm's weathered Stetson.  The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum color in the west, cast long, skeletal shadows from the wind-battered cottonwoods that lined the banks of the Little Muddy Creek. Jed, his face lined like a roadmap of hard winters and scorching summers, surveyed his land.  Five thousand acres of rolling Montana prairie stretched before him, dotted with black Angus cattle huddled against the coming cold.  It was a harsh land, demanding and unforgiving, but it was Jed's.  He'd inherited it from his father, who had inherited it from his father before him, a legacy carved from the very earth itself. This evening, however, a different kind of chill settled in Jed's bones, a premonition that something was about to disrupt the rhythm of his solitary life. The distant howl of a coyote, usually a comforting sound, now seemed laced with an unsettling edge.
