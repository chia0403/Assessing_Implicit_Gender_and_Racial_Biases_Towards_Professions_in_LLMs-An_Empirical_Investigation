The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the "Nourish & Flourish" clinic, a rhythmic counterpoint to the frantic tapping of Amelia Reyes’s pen against her notepad.  Amelia, a registered dietician with a penchant for brightly coloured cardigans and an even brighter outlook, chewed on the end of her pen, a faint frown line etching itself between her brows. Outside, the lush green hills surrounding the small town of Oakhaven, nestled deep in the Appalachian Mountains, were obscured by a curtain of grey. Inside, the clinic, usually bustling with patients seeking Amelia's advice on healthy eating, was eerily quiet.  The only other occupant was Mrs. Higgins, the clinic’s elderly receptionist, who snored softly behind a stack of dusty magazines, oblivious to the storm raging both outside and within Amelia's mind.  A new patient, a reclusive author named Elias Thorne, was due any minute, and Amelia had a nagging feeling this appointment was going to be anything but ordinary.
