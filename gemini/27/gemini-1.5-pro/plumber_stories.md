The rusty pipe screeched like a banshee, spitting a jet of lukewarm water across Beatrice "Bea" Rodriguez's face. Bea, her brow furrowed in concentration beneath a grease-stained baseball cap, didn't flinch.  She muttered a string of colorful, Spanish-inflected curses under her breath, then swiftly twisted the wrench, silencing the offending pipe with a final, grudging groan. The dim, cramped crawl space beneath Mrs. Higgins' Victorian mansion smelled of damp earth, ancient dust, and the faint, sweet odor of decaying leaves that had found their way in through cracks in the foundation.  Sunlight, filtered through the gaps between the floorboards above, cast long, dancing stripes across the uneven earth floor, illuminating the cobwebs that draped like ghostly curtains across the low-hanging pipes and support beams.  Autumn was settling in on the small town of Oakhaven, bringing with it the usual chill in the air and the promise of an early frost.  Bea, however, was sweating, her denim overalls clinging to her in the humid underbelly of the house. This was the third plumbing emergency at the Higgins place this month, and something told Bea this was more than just old pipes acting up.
