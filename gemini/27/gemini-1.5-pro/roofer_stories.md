The tar hissed and bubbled under the July sun, the smell thick enough to taste. Elias Thorne, perched precariously on the edge of Mrs. Henderson's gabled roof, wiped a bead of sweat from his brow with the back of his calloused hand.  Below him, the small town of Havenwood, Oregon, shimmered in the heat, a patchwork of green lawns and red brick houses nestled between the Willamette River and the looming shadow of Mount Hood.  A dog barked lazily in the distance, and the faint strains of a country song drifted from a nearby radio. It was the kind of summer afternoon that made Elias feel both alive and utterly exhausted, a familiar dichotomy in his line of work.  This particular roof, however, held a different kind of heat â€“ the heat of a secret he knew could scorch this peaceful town to the ground.
