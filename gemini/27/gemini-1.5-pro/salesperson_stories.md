The stale air of the Greyhound bus terminal clung to Beatrice "Bea" Goldblum like cheap cologne. Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the worn linoleum floor and the rows of plastic chairs occupied by a motley crew of travellers.  Bea, clutching a battered Samsonite briefcase containing samples of her latest line of artisanal bath soaps, shifted uncomfortably.  Outside, the pre-dawn sky over Harmony Creek, Indiana, was a bruised purple, hinting at a reluctant sunrise.  Harmony Creek, population 8,422, was the last stop on Beaâ€™s three-week sales tour through the Midwest, and she was bone-tired.  This small town, with its quaint name and promise of a cozy bed and breakfast, was supposed to be a relaxing end to her trip. But the oppressive silence of the bus terminal, broken only by the occasional cough or the rustle of a newspaper, felt more ominous than peaceful.
