The rusted tailgate of Elias Thorne's pickup truck groaned in protest as he lowered it, the sound swallowed by the dense, humid air of a Florida morning.  Spanish moss draped from the live oaks like forgotten laundry, casting long, skeletal shadows across the manicured lawn of the Vandergelt estate.  Elias, sweat already beading on his forehead despite the early hour, surveyed his domain for the day.  Hibiscus bushes exploded in vibrant pinks and oranges, struggling for dominance against the encroaching emerald green of the St. Augustine grass.  A fountain, shaped like a cherubic dolphin, gurgled musically in the center of a circular driveway paved with blush-colored bricks.  The Vandergelts spared no expense on their little slice of paradise tucked away in the gated community of Cypress Cay, a place where even the palm trees seemed to hold themselves with an air of haughty indifference.  Elias, however, felt no awe. He saw only the work. The relentless, back-breaking, sun-drenched work that kept this artificial Eden alive.
