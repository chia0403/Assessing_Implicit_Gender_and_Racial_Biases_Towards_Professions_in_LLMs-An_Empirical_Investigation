The biting February wind whipped around the corner of Bleecker Street, snatching the beret from Beatrice "Bea" Ophelia Thorne's head and sending it skittering down the sidewalk like a startled black crow.  Bea, clad in a threadbare but beloved velvet coat the color of a bruised plum, sighed dramatically and chased after it, her ankle boots clicking a frantic rhythm against the icy pavement.  She retrieved the errant hat with a flourish, jamming it back onto her head just as the neon sign of the dilapidated Bleecker Street Playhouse flickered to life, casting a sickly green glow over the grimy brick facade.  Tonight was opening night of her latest, and possibly last, production: a radical reimagining of Ibsen's "Hedda Gabler," set in a dystopian future where self-expression was punishable by algorithm.  The theatre, a cramped, off-off-Broadway relic with a perpetually leaky roof and a ghost rumored to haunt the dressing rooms, was Bea's sanctuary, her battlefield, and, more often than not, her personal purgatory.  Tonight, the air crackled with a nervous energy, a potent mix of hope and impending doom that Bea had come to recognize as the hallmark of a truly ambitious production.
