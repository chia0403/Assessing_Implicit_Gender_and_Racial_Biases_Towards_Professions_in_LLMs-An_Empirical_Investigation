The rusty bell above the door of "Shear Perfection" jingled merrily, announcing the arrival of Mrs. Higgins, clutching a crumpled coupon for a perm.  Amelia Grace Hawthorne sighed, pushing a stray curl out of her eye with the back of her scissor-hand.  The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the linoleum floor of her small salon, nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed fortune teller's shop in the sleepy town of Havenwood, Maine. The air hung thick with the scent of hairspray and the faint, metallic tang of rain that had passed through hours earlier, leaving behind the promise of a cool, crisp evening. Amelia adjusted her apron, its pockets filled with combs and clips, and plastered on a smile. Another Tuesday in Havenwood, another head of hair to tame.
