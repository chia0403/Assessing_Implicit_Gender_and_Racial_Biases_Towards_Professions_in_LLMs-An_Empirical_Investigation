The salt spray kissed Elara Aurelia Thorne's face as she perched precariously on the jagged cliffs overlooking the churning turquoise waters of the Aegean Sea. The wind, a constant companion on this isolated Greek island of Palios, whipped her auburn braid across her paint-splattered linen smock.  Below, the whitewashed village of Aeolia clung to the hillside like a cluster of seashells, its terracotta roofs glowing warmly under the late afternoon sun.  Elara’s makeshift studio, a small, abandoned shepherd’s hut perched even higher on the cliff face, offered a panoramic vista that stole her breath every morning, and fueled the vibrant landscapes that flowed from her brush. This island, barren and beautiful, had become her sanctuary, a place where the ghosts of her past held less sway and the vibrant hues of the present painted over the monochrome memories.
