The biting November wind whipped around Eleanor Vance, plastering stray strands of auburn hair across her chapped lips. She tugged her scarf tighter, the wool scratching against her chin, and hurried down Bleecker Street, the scent of roasted chestnuts and damp leaves filling the air.  Greenwich Village, usually a vibrant kaleidoscope of artists and eccentrics, was subdued under a blanket of pre-Thanksgiving grey. Eleanor, a graphic designer with a penchant for vintage typefaces and bold colour palettes, felt the oppressive monochrome seep into her usually effervescent mood.  Her destination, a dimly lit, rent-controlled apartment above a falafel shop, was both her sanctuary and her prison. Tonight, however, it held a promise â€“ a commission unlike any she'd received before, one that could finally catapult her from struggling freelancer to established artist.  The email, still vivid in her mind, had simply read: "Design a logo for the impossible."
