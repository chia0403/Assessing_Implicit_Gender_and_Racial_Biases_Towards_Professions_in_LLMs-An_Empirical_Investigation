The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne, plastering his dark hair against his forehead as he crossed the cobblestone courtyard of the ancient Château de Verglas.  Gargoyles, weathered smooth by centuries of rain and wind, leered down at him from the parapets.  Nestled deep in the French Alps, the château, once a magnificent symbol of aristocratic power, now felt more like a mausoleum. Elias pulled his collar higher, the chill seeping through his thick tweed coat. He was here to consult on a case so bizarre, so steeped in the macabre, that even seasoned detectives from the Lyon Prefecture were baffled. A renowned forensic psychologist specializing in criminal profiling, Elias had dealt with his share of the gruesome, but the sparse details he'd received about this case hinted at something truly unsettling.  The victim, a prominent art collector named Armand Moreau, had been found in the château's cavernous wine cellar, not dead, but…transformed. The official police report used the word “petrified,” although Elias suspected a more metaphorical meaning.  Whatever had happened, it was enough to bring him all the way from his quiet office in Paris to this isolated, snow-dusted corner of France.  The heavy oak door of the château creaked open, revealing a stern-faced gendarme who ushered him inside. The air within was thick with the scent of damp stone and something else, something subtly metallic that Elias couldn't quite place.  He had a feeling this case was about to burrow deep under his skin.
