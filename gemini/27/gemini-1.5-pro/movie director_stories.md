The biting wind whipped off the Pacific, tearing at the edges of Amelia "Amy" Reyes's cashmere scarf.  It clung to her like a damp, unwelcome hug, mirroring the knot of anxiety tightening in her stomach.  Below her, the cliffs of Big Sur plunged dramatically into the churning turquoise water, a vista that normally filled her with inspiration. Today, however, the breathtaking beauty felt more like a mocking backdrop to her impending doom.  Perched precariously on a folding director's chair, clutching a lukewarm thermos of black coffee, Amy Reyes stared at the makeshift set constructed on the precarious edge of the cliff.  It consisted of a single vintage Airstream trailer, polished to a gleaming silver, and a rickety wooden table with two chairs facing the ocean.  This was supposed to be the climactic scene of "Sunset Drive," her comeback film, the one that would either resurrect her career or bury it six feet under alongside her last three box-office flops.
