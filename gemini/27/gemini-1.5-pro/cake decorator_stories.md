The scent of caramelizing sugar hung thick in the air, mingling with the floral perfume of a thousand buttercream roses.  Outside, the relentless Seattle rain hammered against the large bakery window, blurring the neon glow of "Sugar & Bloom" into a vibrant, Impressionist smear. Inside, Eliza Jane Higginbottom, her strawberry-blonde braid wound tight like a cinnamon swirl, surveyed her latest creation.  A four-tiered masterpiece destined for a society wedding, it shimmered beneath the warm bakery lights, adorned with delicate sugar orchids and cascading ribbons of white chocolate.  Eliza Jane smoothed down the ivory fondant with a practiced hand, her brow furrowed in concentration.  This wasn't just a cake; it was a testament to her artistry, a sugary monument to love and commitment.  Little did she know, however, that the true test of her commitment was about to walk through the door, not in the form of a nervous groom, but a face from her past she'd thought long buried beneath layers of buttercream and forgotten memories.
