Inside, the air was sterile, smelling faintly of antiseptic and coffee brewing in the breakroom down the hall.  Amelia, in her crisp white coat and lavender scrubs, methodically arranged her tray: tourniquets, vacutainers, butterfly needles, alcohol swabs, each in its designated place. Today, like every other day, her mission was to draw blood, a task she approached with a quiet competence and a surprising amount of empathy for those who flinched at the sight of a needle. But this particular Tuesday morning held a different energy, a subtle shift in the air that Amelia couldn't quite place, a premonition that today wouldnâ€™t be like every other day.
