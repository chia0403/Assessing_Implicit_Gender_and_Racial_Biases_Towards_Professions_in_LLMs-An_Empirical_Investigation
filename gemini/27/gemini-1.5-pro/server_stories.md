The flickering neon sign of the Starlight Diner cast a lurid, otherworldly glow on the rain-slicked asphalt of Highway 17. Inside, the air hung thick with the aroma of frying onions, stale coffee, and desperation.  Amelia "Amy" Rose Hawthorne, her nametag slightly askew on her faded turquoise uniform, leaned against the counter, idly tracing circles in the condensation with a damp rag.  It was 2:17 am, a dead zone between the late-night truckers and the early-morning risers. The only other occupants of the diner were a couple of grey-haired regulars huddled over a chessboard in the corner booth, and a lone figure slumped over a half-eaten plate of fries, his face obscured by the shadow of a wide-brimmed hat.  Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, rattling the windows of the lonely diner, a harbinger of the storm brewing on the horizon.  Amy sighed, the kind of sigh born from bone-deep weariness and a vague sense of unease.  This night, she felt it in her bones, was going to be different.
