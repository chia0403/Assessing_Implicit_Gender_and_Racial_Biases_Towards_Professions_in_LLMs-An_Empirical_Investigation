The clatter of horse-drawn carriages against the cobblestones of Rue Charlot was a familiar lullaby to  Genevieve Augustine Lefevre.  Her atelier, nestled between a boulangerie with the perpetual aroma of warm bread and a somewhat dubious purveyor of "exotic remedies," was bathed in the pearly light of a Parisian dawn.  Dust motes danced in the beams that slanted through the tall windows, illuminating the chaos of her workroom. Swathes of silk in vibrant hues pooled on the floor, a half-finished gown of emerald green velvet draped over a dress form, and pins, needles, and spools of thread scattered across every available surface. Genevieve, her dark hair pulled back in a loose knot, hummed a nameless tune as she carefully pinned a delicate lace collar onto a blush-pink satin bodice.  Outside, the city was slowly waking, but within the confines of her small, vibrant world, Genevieve's day had already begun. The year was 1888, and the air, thick with the promise of spring, also carried whispers of something darker, something unsettling, that even the finest silks and satins couldn't quite conceal.
