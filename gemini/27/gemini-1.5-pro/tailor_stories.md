The clatter of trams and the hawkers' cries of "Fresh oysters!" and "Hot chestnuts!" barely pierced the thick, steamed-up windows of Elias Finch's tailoring shop.  Nestled between a fishmonger and a somewhat dubious apothecary on Crowfoot Lane, the shop was a haven of quiet precision in the bustling heart of New Birmingham.  Gas lamps cast a warm glow on bolts of rich velvet, tweed, and silk, their colours muted by the late November gloom outside. Elias himself, a man of forty with needle-pricked fingers and perpetually tired eyes the colour of faded denim, was hunched over his workbench.  A half-finished waistcoat of emerald green brocade lay beneath his lamp, the intricate floral embroidery gleaming like captured jewels. The air within the shop, thick with the scent of beeswax, wool, and the faintest hint of pipe tobacco, hung heavy with anticipation. Elias knew, with a certainty that settled deep in his bones, that tonight would be unlike any other.
