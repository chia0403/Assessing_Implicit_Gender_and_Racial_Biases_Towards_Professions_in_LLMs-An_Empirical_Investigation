The salt spray stung Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's cheeks, the damp air plastering stray strands of her dark hair to her forehead.  She pulled her worn wool coat tighter around her as she navigated the slick, cobbled streets of Portwenn, a small fishing village perched on the rugged Cornish coast.  Grey cottages, hunched against the perpetual wind, clung to the cliffs like limpets, their windows reflecting the steel-grey sky.  The only splash of colour came from the brightly painted fishing boats bobbing in the harbour, their nets hanging like forlorn seaweed.  Amy, seeking refuge from the biting wind and a place to finally wrestle with her writer's block, pushed open the heavy wooden door of The Mermaid's Purse, a pub promising warmth and, judging by the tantalizing smell of woodsmoke and brewing coffee, a much-needed dose of inspiration.  Inside, a fire crackled merrily in the hearth, casting dancing shadows across the low-beamed ceiling.  The air was thick with the murmur of conversation and the clinking of glasses, a comforting hum against the tempestuous symphony of the sea outside. This, Amy hoped, was where the words would finally come.
