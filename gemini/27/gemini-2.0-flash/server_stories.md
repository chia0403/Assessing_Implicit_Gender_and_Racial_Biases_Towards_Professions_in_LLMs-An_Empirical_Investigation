The chipped ceramic plate rattled precariously in Esmeralda Valentina Rodriguez’s hand as she navigated the minefield of mismatched tables and chattering patrons that was "The Cozy Corner" on a Saturday morning. Steam rose from the plate, carrying the scent of greasy bacon and sugary maple syrup, a scent that had clung to her clothes, her hair, her very being for the last three years. Outside, the October air was crisp and smelled of damp leaves, a scent she only caught in stolen glimpses through the foggy window.

The Cozy Corner was nestled in the heart of Harmony Creek, a town perpetually stuck in a Norman Rockwell painting. Located just off Main Street, it was a haven for tourists seeking a comforting slice of Americana, and for locals who craved a dependable plate of pancakes after a long week. The walls were a sickly sweet shade of peach, adorned with faded photographs of Harmony Creek’s "founding fathers" (all men, all sporting impressive facial hair). Crochet doilies, perpetually askew, perched precariously on every surface. The floor, linoleum patterned to mimic hardwood, groaned under the weight of years and countless dropped forks. It was charming, in a way that was both endearing and utterly exhausting. Esmeralda often wondered if she'd be better off just living behind the counter, breathing in the sugary air and becoming one with the sticky, maple-syrup-stained surfaces.
