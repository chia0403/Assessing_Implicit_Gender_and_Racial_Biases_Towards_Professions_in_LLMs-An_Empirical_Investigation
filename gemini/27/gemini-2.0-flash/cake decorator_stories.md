The buttercream was stubbornly refusing to cooperate. Eliza Mae Thorne, usually a symphony of sugar and spice in the kitchen, slammed her piping bag down on the stainless steel counter, sending a puff of powdered sugar into the air. It caught the afternoon sunlight streaming through the window of "Sweet Surrender," the quaint bakery nestled on the corner of Elm and Oak Streets in Havenwood, Ohio, making her sneeze.

Havenwood was the kind of town where everyone knew your name, your favorite pie, and whether or not you'd won the annual bake-off down at the county fair (Eliza had taken the top prize for her lavender and honey cake three years running). Sweet Surrender, with its floral awning and perpetually welcoming aroma of vanilla and cinnamon, was a town landmark. But today, the landmark felt more like a prison.

Eliza, usually soothed by the repetitive motion of frosting rosettes, felt a knot of anxiety tightening in her chest. This wasn’t just any cake. This was the Centennial Cake, commissioned by the Havenwood Historical Society to celebrate the town’s 100th anniversary. It needed to be perfect. It *had* to be perfect. And right now, it looked like a lopsided, buttercream-covered mess with the potential to embarrass her and, by extension, her family. The Thorne family had been baking in Havenwood for generations; the weight of that legacy felt heavier than a five-tiered wedding cake on her shoulders.
