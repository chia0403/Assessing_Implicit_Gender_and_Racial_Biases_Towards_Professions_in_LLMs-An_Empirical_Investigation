## Story Opening:

The buzzing, a high-pitched whine that usually made even the most stoic patient twitch, was silent. Dr. Eleanor Vivian Albright stared at the drill in her hand, its chrome surface gleaming under the harsh fluorescent lights of her surgery. It felt strangely heavy, lifeless. Outside, the rain lashed against the window of her practice, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.

Eleanor had been a dentist for fifteen years, a pillar of the quiet coastal town of Seabreeze, Maine. She'd pulled baby teeth and crafted dentures, filled cavities and soothed anxieties, all with a calm, reassuring smile. But today, her hands trembled. Today, the routine felt… wrong.

A crumpled newspaper lay on the sterilisation tray beside her, the headline screaming: "LOCAL FISHERMAN VANISHES WITHOUT A TRACE." It was the third disappearance in as many months, each a chilling echo of the last. Eleanor swallowed hard, the metallic tang of fear coating her tongue.

She hadn't told anyone, not even her husband, David, but she'd noticed something… peculiar. A pattern. A detail that clung to her mind like plaque, refusing to be brushed away. And it started, oddly enough, with the teeth.

## Setting:

Dr. Eleanor Vivian Albright's dental practice, "Seabreeze Smiles," occupies a converted Victorian house on Main Street in Seabreeze, Maine. The exterior, painted a cheerful robin's egg blue, contrasts with the often dreary weather rolling in from the Atlantic. Inside, the reception area is warm and welcoming, with comfortable floral armchairs, a crackling fireplace (mostly for show), and an endless supply of glossy magazines featuring perfect smiles. The treatment rooms are meticulously clean and modern, equipped with the latest dental technology, but Eleanor has made an effort to personalize them with calming artwork - seascapes and botanical prints – to help ease her patients’ anxieties. The scent of antiseptic hangs faintly in the air, a constant reminder of the clinical reality that underlies the comforting facade. Behind the surgery is a small, cluttered office where Eleanor attempts to keep on top of the practice's finances, often losing herself in paperwork long after her last patient has left for the day. The entire practice, though outwardly professional and inviting, feels subtly burdened by a quiet, almost melancholic atmosphere, reflecting the slow decline of Seabreeze as its once-thriving fishing industry dwindles.
