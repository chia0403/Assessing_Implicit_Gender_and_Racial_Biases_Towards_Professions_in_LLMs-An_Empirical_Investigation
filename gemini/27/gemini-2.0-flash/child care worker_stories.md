## Story Opening:

The air in the "Bunny Burrow" playroom smelled aggressively of disinfectant and stale crackers, a scent Clara Mae Higgins had come to associate with Tuesday afternoons. Outside, the November sky was the color of old dishwater, and the wind howled against the oversized windows of the community center. Inside, however, chaos reigned. A miniature Elmo puppet was being violently dismembered by a surprisingly strong four-year-old named Dylan, a sticky substance that may or may not have been Play-Doh adorned the hair of little Lily, and a wail of operatic proportions was emanating from the corner where two boys were locked in a dispute over a plastic dinosaur. Clara Mae sighed, a sound lost in the general din. It was only 3:15, and she still had two long, sticky hours before she could finally escape and contemplate a life where she didn't have to mediate territorial disputes between miniature tyrannosaurus rexes.
## Setting:

**The Bunny Burrow, located within the Evergreen Community Center in Evergreen, Ohio.**

The Bunny Burrow is a bright, albeit slightly worn, playroom designed for children aged three to five. Walls are painted in pastel hues of blue, yellow, and green. One wall is covered in a mural depicting various woodland creatures frolicking in a cartoonish forest. The floor is covered in a soft, padded matting that has seen better days, bearing the scars of countless spills and crayon mishaps.

Scattered around the room are various play stations: a small kitchenette with plastic food, a dress-up corner overflowing with costumes, a building block area, a reading nook with a colorful rug and a collection of well-loved children's books, and a circle time area with a small rug and a whiteboard covered in scribbles.

The room is lit by fluorescent lights, casting a somewhat harsh glow. The air is often thick with the scent of disinfectant, various art supplies, and the aforementioned stale crackers, remnants of the daily snack time. Large windows look out onto a small playground, currently battered by the November wind.

The Bunny Burrow is a bustling hub of activity during the weekdays, a place where imaginations run wild, friendships are forged, and Clara Mae Higgins tries her best to maintain order amidst the delightful, yet often overwhelming, chaos.
