**Story Opening:**

The scent of burnt rosemary hung heavy in the air, a cruel parody of the fragrant calm Dr. Evelyn Reed usually cultivated in her tiny office. Her latest client, a particularly stressed-out software engineer named Mark, had apparently tried to make his own aromatherapy candle and, based on the pungent aroma, failed spectacularly. Evelyn sighed, pushing back the overflowing files on her desk – "Deconstructing the Paleo Diet," "The Gut-Brain Connection in Teenage Anxiety," "The Allure of Ultra-Processed Foods" – and forced a smile. This was not how she envisioned her Tuesday starting. Mark was thirty minutes late and the smell was aggressively assaulting her sinuses.

**Setting:**

Evelyn's office, "The Seed & Sprout Nutrition Studio," was located on the second floor of a renovated brick building in the vibrant, up-and-coming neighborhood of "The Grain District" in Providence, Rhode Island. The Grain District, once a collection of abandoned mills and warehouses, was now a hub for artisanal bakeries, farm-to-table restaurants, and holistic health practices. Evelyn had meticulously designed her studio to feel welcoming and approachable, a sanctuary from the overwhelming noise of fad diets and conflicting health advice that bombarded people daily.

The walls were painted a soothing shade of sage green, accented with reclaimed wood shelving displaying neatly organized rows of cookbooks, jars of organic herbs, and framed prints of vibrant fruits and vegetables. A large, sun-drenched window overlooked the bustling street below, offering a glimpse of the local farmers market that popped up every Saturday. Two comfortable armchairs flanked a small, round table made of sustainably sourced bamboo, creating a relaxed space for consultations. Even the lighting, soft and diffused, was carefully chosen to minimize eye strain and promote a sense of tranquility. The entire space was meticulously curated to embody Evelyn’s philosophy: health and wellness should be approachable, sustainable, and rooted in mindful living.
