The bell above the door to "Shear Delight" chimed a breezy little melody, almost lost in the rhythmic snip-snip-snip that was the soundtrack of Henrietta Willowbrook's life. Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long, honeyed shadows across Willow Creek, Montana. Main Street was bustling, a mix of tourists snapping photos of the faux-Victorian storefronts and locals grabbing last-minute groceries before heading home to their ranches. A gentle breeze, carrying the scent of pine needles and freshly cut hay, rustled the red and white striped awning above Henrietta's salon.

Inside, the air was a fragrant cocktail of hairspray, lavender shampoo, and quiet chatter. Henrietta, or "Etta" as everyone called her, stood poised behind her antique barber chair, her nimble fingers dancing through Mrs. Gable's thick, grey bob. Her own fiery red hair, a tangled halo tamed with a single barrette, contrasted sharply with her client's more sedate style. "So, Mrs. Gable," Henrietta said, her voice a warm, comforting murmur, "are we still thinking a slight lift for the holidays? Maybe a little more volume at the crown?"
