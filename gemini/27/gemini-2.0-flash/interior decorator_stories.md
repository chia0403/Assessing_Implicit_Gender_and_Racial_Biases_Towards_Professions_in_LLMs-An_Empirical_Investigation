## Story Opening:

The scent of lavender and regret hung thick in the air, clinging to the velvet drapes and antique Persian rugs like stubborn dust. Amelia Beatrice Featherstonehaugh, interior decorator extraordinaire, wrinkled her nose, a gesture that did little to dislodge the fine lines around her eyes. "More air, Agnes, for God's sake!" she commanded, her voice, usually a dulcet murmur designed to soothe even the most demanding client, now edged with a sharpness that echoed through the cavernous drawing-room. Agnes, a wisp of a woman perpetually teetering on the edge of nervous exhaustion, scurried to obey, fumbling with the heavy sash window. Amelia sighed, massaging the bridge of her nose. This was going to be a long one.

## Setting:

Amelia found herself steeped in the melancholic grandeur of Blackwood Manor, a sprawling gothic edifice clinging to the windswept cliffs of Cornwall. Once the pride of the Blackwood family, its salt-streaked facade now wore the weary face of neglect. Inside, generations of wealth manifested in a mishmash of styles: gilded Rococo mirrors vying for attention with somber Victorian portraits, dusty suits of armour guarding forgotten corners, and threadbare tapestries depicting scenes of long-lost battles. The air was heavy with the scent of beeswax polish and something else, something indefinable, like the ghost of forgotten perfume and unspoken secrets. Sunlight, when it managed to pierce the perpetually overcast sky, filtered through the stained-glass windows, casting fragmented, jewel-toned shadows that danced across the decaying splendour. The Manor, like its inhabitants, felt haunted, steeped in the weight of its own history, and Amelia Beatrice Featherstonehaugh had been summoned to breathe new life into its ailing heart.
