The dust, the same color as dried blood, swirled around Jebediah "Jeb" Harding's worn-out boots, kicked up by a restless wind that tasted of alkali and impending rain. He squinted, his eyes, the color of chipped flint, narrowed against the harsh glare of the setting sun. The sun, a bruised orange, bled across the vast expanse of the Montana sky, painting the rolling hills in shades of crimson and burnt sienna. Heâ€™d seen a thousand sunsets just like this, and each one was a reminder of the relentless cycle, the ceaseless demands of the land.

Jeb stood on the porch of the Harding ranch house, a weathered, two-story structure that had been in his family for four generations. The wood was gray and splintered, the paint long since peeled away, but it stood defiant against the elements, a testament to the Harding grit. To his left, the barn, a sprawling, rambling affair, groaned under the weight of years and patched-up repairs. Beyond that, the corrals, holding pens, and grazing fields stretched out, disappearing into the hazy distance. This was Harding territory, a hardscrabble existence carved out of the unforgiving Montana landscape. It was all Jeb knew, all he had ever wanted. And tonight, it felt heavier than usual.
