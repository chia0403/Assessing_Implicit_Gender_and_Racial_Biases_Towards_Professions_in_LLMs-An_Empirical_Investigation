Okay, here's a story opening and setting, including the full name of the main character, a professor:

**Opening:**

The biting wind whipped across the cobblestones of Alchemist's Row, snatching at Professor Alistair Humphrey Finch's tweed coat. He hunched deeper into himself, the collar scratching against his neck, but the chill seeped through nonetheless. Tonight, the ancient alley felt less charmingly historic and more like a glacial purgatory. He clutched the worn leather satchel tighter, the weight of the ancient text inside feeling heavier with each step. He hadn't felt this anxious since his disastrous attempt at transmuting lead into gold during his postgraduate years – an experiment that had resulted in a minor explosion and a lifetime ban from the university’s alchemy lab.

**Setting:**

The story is set in the fictional, perpetually overcast city of Aethelburg. Aethelburg is a city steeped in history, a place where the past clings to the present like the damp moss that grows on its ancient stone buildings. It is a city of gothic spires, labyrinthine alleyways, and hidden courtyards. A palpable sense of old magic hangs in the air, mingling with the grime and the scent of coal smoke. The university, the Alma Mater of Professor Finch, is a collection of imposing structures dating back to the medieval era, its halls filled with the ghosts of scholars past. The Alchemist's Row, where this scene opens, is one of the oldest parts of the city, a narrow, winding street lined with shops selling obscure potions, rare herbs, and dusty tomes. It's a place where the curious and the desperate come seeking knowledge, solutions, or sometimes, simply a little bit of magic.
