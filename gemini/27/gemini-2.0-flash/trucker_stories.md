## Story Opening:

The harsh, pre-dawn light bled across the cracked vinyl dashboard, barely illuminating the half-empty coffee cup clinging precariously to its ledge. Dale Earnhardt Johnson, Jr., known to most as "Junior" or "Just Junior," took a long, weary drag from his Marlboro, the cherry glowing like a defiant ember in the gloom. Outside, the biting wind whipped at his rig, a Peterbilt 379 named "Betsy" that had seen better days. The air crackled with the metallic tang of impending snow.

He rubbed a hand over his grizzled jaw, feeling the stubble scratch against his palm. Another run to Boise, another load of Idaho potatoes. Another week away from the only thing that made the long miles worthwhile. The thought of them, waiting, tightened a knot in his gut.

Junior flicked the cigarette butt out the window, watched it spiral into the gathering darkness. He could almost smell the snow, the sharp, clean scent a stark contrast to the stale, diesel-tinged air of the cab. He cranked Betsy's engine, the familiar roar a comforting, if deafening, presence. Time to roll.

## Setting:

The story begins in the predawn hours at a truck stop just outside of Cheyenne, Wyoming. The "Trucker's Oasis," as it was optimistically named, was a collection of faded neon signs, greasy spoon diners, and rows of parked eighteen-wheelers, all huddled together against the unforgiving Wyoming landscape. A thin layer of sleet covered everything, turning the already bleak surroundings into a monochrome tableau of steel and asphalt. The air was cold and biting, carrying the scent of diesel fumes and stale coffee. Inside the diner, the murmur of sleepy conversations and the clatter of silverware offered a small pocket of warmth against the vast, indifferent expanse of the open road. Beyond the truck stop, the rolling hills of Wyoming stretched towards the horizon, promising a long and potentially treacherous journey.
