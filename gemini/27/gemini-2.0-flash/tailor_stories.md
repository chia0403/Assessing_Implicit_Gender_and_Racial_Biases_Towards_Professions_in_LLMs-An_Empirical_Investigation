Okay, here's a story opening and setting, centered around a tailor:

**Setting:** The year is 1938. A thin, persistent rain slicked the cobblestones of Rue du Sentier in Paris, reflecting the dim, flickering gas lamps that lined the narrow street. The air hung thick with the scent of damp wool, cheap perfume, and the ever-present aroma of roasting chestnuts from a nearby vendor. The buildings, tightly packed together, leaned in on each other like gossiping crones, their windows glowing with warm, inviting light. This particular corner of the 2nd arrondissement was the heart of the garment district, a place where dreams were woven into fabric and fortunes were made – and broken – with the cut of a seam.

**Story Opening:**

"Damn this wretched weather," muttered Evander Jean-Baptiste Dubois, his breath fogging the already steamed-up window of his small tailoring shop.  He tugged at the brim of his spectacles, his long, slender fingers leaving smudges on the glass.  Outside, a particularly brazen gust of wind rattled the sign hanging precariously above the doorway: "Dubois & Fils - Tailors for the Discerning Gentleman" - a sign that had seen better days, much like Evander himself. The "Fils" had been painted over years ago, after his father, a master tailor, had succumbed to influenza, leaving Evander with a mountain of debt and a reputation to uphold. He peered through the grimy pane, hoping to see the familiar figure of Monsieur Armand, his most loyal (and most reliably paying) customer. But the only figure he saw was a hunched form hurrying past, shrouded in a dark cloak, disappearing into the swirling Parisian gloom. Evander sighed, the sound a weary rustle in the quiet of the shop.  Another day ending without a single sale.  Another day closer to losing everything. The whispers about the encroaching war felt closer than ever, and even the "discerning gentlemen" of Paris seemed to be tightening their purse strings, more concerned with survival than Savile Row perfection.
