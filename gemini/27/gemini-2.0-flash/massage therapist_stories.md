The faint scent of eucalyptus hung in the air, clinging to the plush, dark green towels draped over the heated massage table. Outside, the Pacific wind howled a mournful song against the windows of the coastal cottage, a counterpoint to the gentle, instrumental music drifting from the small speakers hidden amongst the ferns. Inside, it was a sanctuary, a world away from the anxieties of Newport, Oregon. This was Serenity Shores Spa, and for Amelia Josephine Hawthorne, it was her safe space, her haven, and her livelihood.

Amelia, a woman whose smile lines hinted at a life both joyfully lived and gently weathered, adjusted the thermostat, ensuring the room was perfectly balanced between warm and welcoming. She glanced at the clock above the antique writing desk she used as a reception area. Five minutes until Mrs. Gable arrived, and Amelia wanted everything to be perfect. Mrs. Gable carried the weight of the world on her shoulders, or rather, in her neck and upper back, and Amelia felt a profound sense of responsibility to ease that burden, if only for an hour. She took a deep breath, inhaling the soothing aroma of lavender and eucalyptus, and prepared to work her magic. The storm outside might rage, but inside Serenity Shores, peace would reign.
