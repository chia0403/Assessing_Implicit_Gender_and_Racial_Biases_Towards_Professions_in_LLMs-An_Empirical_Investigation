The late afternoon sun, a bruised peach color hanging low in the Virginia sky, cast long, dramatic shadows across Mrs. Abernathy’s sprawling, meticulously maintained lawn. Arthur Michael Pruitt, owner and sole proprietor of “Arthur’s Abundant Allotments, Landscaping & Design,” wiped a bead of sweat from his brow with the back of his dirt-stained glove. He wasn't used to humidity like this, having spent most of his life in the drier climate of Colorado. Still, the Shenandoah Valley had its charms, even if they came with a heaping helping of moisture.

Arthur squinted at the riot of petunias overflowing from their terracotta pots, judging their placement with a critical eye. Mrs. Abernathy, bless her heart, had a passion for floral flamboyance that sometimes bordered on the chaotic. He’d spent the last three hours gently nudging the arrangement toward something resembling aesthetic harmony, a task akin to herding particularly stubborn, brightly colored cats.

He stood on the meticulously manicured lawn of "Rose Haven," a sprawling two-story Victorian painted a crisp, almost blinding white. The house sat perched atop a gentle knoll, overlooking a patchwork of rolling hills and verdant farmland. A wraparound porch, laden with hanging ferns and antique rocking chairs, seemed to beckon visitors to stop and stay a while. It was, in Arthur's opinion, a picture-perfect example of Southern charm, but also a pressure cooker of expectations. Mrs. Abernathy expected perfection. And Arthur, ever the professional, aimed to deliver.
