The air hung thick and heavy, saturated with the scent of hot asphalt and exhaust fumes. Dawn hadn't quite broken, painting the eastern sky a bruised purple, but the relentless sun was already promising a scorcher. Dust devils danced across the cracked median of Interstate 15, mocking the slow, creeping crawl of commuter traffic. This was just another Tuesday in the desolate beauty of the Mojave Desert, and for Harold Francis Pettigrew, it was just another day at the office. He squinted, wiping a bead of sweat from his brow with the back of his gloved hand, the orange fluorescent fabric leaving a smudge of grime on his forehead. Harold loved the desert, in a strange, complicated way. He loved its starkness, its silence punctuated only by the roar of passing eighteen-wheelers, its sunsets that bled across the horizon like a painter's masterpiece. But he also knew its cruelty, its unforgiving heat, and the loneliness that could seep into your bones like desert sand. Today, that loneliness felt particularly heavy.

Harold shifted the weight of his jackhammer, the rhythmic thrumming a familiar comfort against the backdrop of the highway. He was part of a road crew tasked with repairing a particularly nasty pothole that had been swallowing tires whole for the past week. He'd been a highway worker for almost twenty years, since heâ€™d returned from the Navy, and had seen his share of accidents, breakdowns, and the occasional strange desert bloom. This stretch of I-15, a ribbon of concrete slicing through the vast emptiness between Barstow and Baker, felt like a second home to him. And right now, home felt a long, long way away.
