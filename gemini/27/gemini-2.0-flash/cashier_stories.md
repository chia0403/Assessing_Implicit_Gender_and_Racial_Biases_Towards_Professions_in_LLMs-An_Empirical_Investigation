The harsh fluorescent lights of "Good Foods, Better Prices" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the late-night grocery rush. Amelia Grace Sterling, her nametag crooked on her green polo, scanned a carton of generic brand eggs with practiced indifference. The barcode beeped its approval, another item on the conveyor belt of a Thursday night shift that felt like it was stretching into infinity.

Outside, a biting November wind rattled the double glass doors, threatening to rip the festive (but slightly deflated) inflatable Santa from its moorings. The parking lot was a bleak expanse of oil-slicked asphalt, illuminated by the sickly yellow glow of sodium streetlights. Amelia could see her breath cloud in the air as a hurried silhouette dashed from a battered pickup truck into the store.

Inside, the air hung heavy with the scent of industrial cleaner and day-old bakery items. A lone banana, bruised and brown, sat forlornly on the candy rack. Most of the shoppers were bleary-eyed and clutching necessities: ramen, energy drinks, diapers. The usual suspects for a pre-weekend, post-paycheck pilgrimage to budget-friendly sustenance.

This was Willow Creek, a town clinging to the edge of the Allegheny National Forest. A town that had seen better days, when the lumber mill hummed and families thrived. Now, Willow Creek was a collection of faded dreams and quiet resignation, and "Good Foods, Better Prices" was its fluorescent-lit heart, pumping the bare minimum of sustenance into its weary veins. Amelia Grace Sterling knew it well. She'd been pumping that bare minimum for the last two years, ever since her own dreams had been splintered by circumstances she was still trying to piece back together.
