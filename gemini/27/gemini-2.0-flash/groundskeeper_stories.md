## Story Opening:

The humid Georgia morning clung to Silas Bartholomew Finch like a second skin. He could already feel the sweat beading on his brow as he wrestled the ancient, sputtering lawnmower out of the groundskeeper's shed. The infernal contraption coughed and wheezed, threatening to give up the ghost before he even made it to the first flowerbed. Silas cursed under his breath, a string of whispered grievances directed at the mower, the heat, and the sheer futility of trying to maintain any semblance of order on the sprawling, overgrown grounds of Briarwood Manor. It wasnâ€™t just a house; it was a statement. A statement of faded grandeur, whispered secrets, and a stubborn refusal to let go of a past best left buried. And Silas Bartholomew Finch, armed with his weary mower and a pair of well-worn gardening gloves, was tasked with keeping the decay at bay, one weed, one patch of overgrown grass at a time.

## Setting:

**Briarwood Manor** stands sentinel atop a gentle rise overlooking the sleepy town of Oak Haven, Georgia. Once the jewel of the county, it now wears its age like a tattered shawl. Constructed in the antebellum style, its white-columned facade is marred by peeling paint and creeping vines. The grounds are a riot of untamed beauty; ancient oaks drip with Spanish moss, their gnarled branches reaching out like skeletal fingers. Rose bushes, long abandoned, bloom in a profusion of thorny disarray, their perfume heavy and cloying in the humid air. A dilapidated gazebo, its once-elegant roof now caved in, sits half-hidden behind a curtain of wisteria. The overall impression is one of romantic decay, a place where secrets fester and the ghosts of the past roam free. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth, blooming jasmine, and something else... something Silas can never quite put his finger on, a faint, metallic tang that seems to emanate from the very stones of the manor itself.
