## Opening:

The chipped porcelain of the 'Sold' sign glinted in the watery November sun, reflecting back at Eleanor Maeve O'Connell with a mocking brightness. She adjusted the scarf knotted tightly around her neck, the wool doing little to ward off the damp chill that seemed to seep directly from the ground of 3 Oakhaven Drive. It was a done deal, sealed and signed, another hefty commission deposited into the O'Connell Realty coffers. So why, then, did she feel like she’d just sold a piece of her soul along with the overgrown rose bushes and the slightly-rotting porch swing?

## Setting:

Eleanor Maeve O’Connell, a fourth-generation real estate agent in the sleepy, fog-drenched town of Havenwood, Oregon, was standing outside the Victorian-era house she'd just sold. Havenwood, nestled between the Pacific coast and the towering pines of the Tillamook State Forest, was a town steeped in history and secrets, both equally well-preserved. The air always smelled faintly of salt and damp earth, a smell Eleanor, despite her occasional desire to escape, secretly found comforting. 3 Oakhaven Drive itself was a prime example of Havenwood's faded glory; a grand old house slowly succumbing to the persistent embrace of the elements. Its gingerbread trim was peeling, the paint was cracked, and the garden had long surrendered to the wild whims of nature. It sat on a corner lot, overlooking the old Havenwood Cemetery, a vista that provided either peace or morbid fascination, depending on the prospective buyer's disposition. The house, and indeed Havenwood itself, was caught in a perpetual state of twilight, where the mundane and the mysterious danced a delicate waltz.
