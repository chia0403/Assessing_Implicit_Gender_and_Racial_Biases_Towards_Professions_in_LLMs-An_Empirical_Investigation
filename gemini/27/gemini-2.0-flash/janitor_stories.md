The clatter of Mrs. Henderson's monstrous, antique typewriter echoed down the empty hallway, even over the rhythmic whoosh of Ezekiel “Zeke” Thomas’s push broom. It was 3:17 AM, and only the hum of the fluorescent lights and the erratic bursts of Mrs. Henderson’s literary outbursts kept Zeke company in the hushed, cavernous halls of the Grand Majestic Theater.

The Grand Majestic, a once-opulent landmark nestled in the heart of downtown, was now a relic of a bygone era. Gilt paint peeled from the cherubic figures adorning the towering proscenium arch, velvet seats were threadbare and patched, and the faint aroma of stale popcorn clung to the air, a ghostly reminder of its heyday. Zeke, however, loved it. He'd been the Grand Majestic's janitor, its silent guardian, for over twenty years. He knew every creaking floorboard, every chipped tile, every whispering draft that snaked through the backstage corridors. He’d seen it all – forgotten props gathering dust, hopeful actors practicing their lines in the echoing emptiness, and the occasional ghostly flicker of the theater's past glory.

Tonight, however, felt different. A strange energy hung in the air, a subtle vibration that prickled the back of Zeke’s neck. Even the theater’s usual comforting silence felt…charged. He paused by the velvet rope separating the orchestra pit from the stage, his heart thumping a little faster than usual. The stage was shrouded in shadow, a blank canvas waiting for the dawn, and tonight, it seemed to be waiting for something else entirely.
