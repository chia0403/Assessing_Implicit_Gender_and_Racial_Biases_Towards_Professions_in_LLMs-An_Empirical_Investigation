## Story Opening:

The scent of old paper and leather, a comforting, almost nostalgic aroma, filled the air around Cordelia Beatrice Hawthorne. She inhaled deeply, the familiar fragrance settling a restless flutter in her stomach. Outside, the November wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the aged windowpanes of the Oakhaven Public Library. But within these hallowed walls, Cordelia felt anchored, tethered to a lineage of stories that stretched back centuries.

Tonight, however, the stories weren't staying put on the shelves. They were whispering, stirring, demanding attention in a way that Cordelia had never experienced in her ten years as head librarian. The grandfather clock in the reading room chimed seven, its solemn bong echoing the unease that had been building within her all day. Another evening shift, another night battling the relentless encroaching darkness, both literal and figurative. Cordelia straightened her cardigan, its hand-knitted yarn a thin barrier against the creeping chill, and adjusted the reading glasses perched on her nose. Tonight, something was different. Tonight, the library felt less like a refuge and more like a tomb waiting to be disturbed.

## Setting:

**Oakhaven Public Library:** A venerable stone building nestled in the heart of Oakhaven, a small, secluded town in the Appalachian Mountains. The library is a two-story structure, its exterior covered in ivy that turns a vibrant crimson in the autumn. Inside, the main reading room is dominated by towering bookshelves filled with an eclectic collection of books, from well-worn classics to obscure local histories. A grand oak staircase leads to the second floor, which houses the rare books collection, local history archives, and a small, seldom-used auditorium. The air is perpetually cool and slightly damp, carrying the scent of old paper, aged leather, and a hint of something indefinably earthy. Warm lamplight casts long shadows across the room, creating a cozy, yet subtly unsettling atmosphere. The library is more than just a repository of knowledge; it's a living, breathing entity, imbued with the history and secrets of Oakhaven.
