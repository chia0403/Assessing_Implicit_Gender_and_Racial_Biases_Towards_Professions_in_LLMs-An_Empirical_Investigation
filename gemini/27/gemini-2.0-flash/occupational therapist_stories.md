The clock on the wall, shaped like a smiling sun, mocked Eleanor Marguerite Davies with its unwavering cheerfulness. 6:57 AM. Three more minutes until the alarm shrilled and the facade of peaceful sleep would crumble. Outside her window, the fog hung thick and heavy over Seattle’s Queen Anne Hill, a damp, gray blanket smothering any chance of early morning sunshine. Eleanor burrowed deeper under the duvet, inhaling the familiar scent of lavender and old books that permeated her small apartment.

She loved her view of the Space Needle poking its pointy head through the mist on a clear day, but mornings like this… mornings like this made the weight of her job as an occupational therapist at St. Jude’s Children’s Hospital feel particularly heavy. Today, she had a new patient, a five-year-old boy named Leo who had suffered a traumatic brain injury. Eleanor had read his chart, of course, but she knew that no sterile report could truly prepare her for the reality of his situation, for the hope clinging to his parents' every word, for the unspoken pressure to somehow knit back together a life shattered too soon.
