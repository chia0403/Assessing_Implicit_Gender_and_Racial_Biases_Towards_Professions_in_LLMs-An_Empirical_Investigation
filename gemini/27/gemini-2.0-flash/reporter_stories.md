Okay, here's a story opening and setting:

**Setting:** The cramped, smoky confines of "The Tipsy Quill," a dive bar nestled in the heart of New Orleans' French Quarter. It's a Thursday night, the air thick with the scent of stale beer, cheap perfume, and desperation. Rain lashes against the windowpanes, mirroring the storm brewing inside me. The neon sign above the bar flickers intermittently, casting an erratic, lurid glow on the faces of the patrons – a motley crew of tourists, hustlers, and lost souls.

**Story Opening:**

"Another Sazerac, Mickey," I croaked, my voice raspy from too many cigarettes and too little sleep. Mickey, the bartender, a mountain of a man with a perpetually weary expression, just nodded and set about mixing the drink. I watched him, not really seeing him, my mind still replaying the voicemail.

*"...Eleanor, it's Mrs. Dubois. I know you don't usually do… these kinds of stories, but I'm desperate. My grandson, Pierre… he's gone missing. The police, they're not taking it seriously. Please, Eleanor, you're his only hope."*

Eleanor Grace Harding, ace reporter for the *New Orleans Clarion*, specializing in exposing corrupt politicians and uncovering financial scandals, was *definitely* not the person Mrs. Dubois should be calling about a missing teenager. But the quaver in the woman's voice, the sheer raw panic, had gnawed at me. And truth be told, I was bored. My usual beat had gone stale, the city's rot too familiar to shock me anymore. A missing person case, especially in the labyrinthine world of New Orleans, felt like a dark rabbit hole worth diving into. I took a long gulp of the Sazerac, the absinthe burning a welcome path down my throat. This was going to be interesting. Maybe even dangerous. And God, I needed that.
