Okay, here's a story opening with a carpenter main character, including setting details:

**Story Opening:**

The bite of sawdust hung in the air, a fragrant, if irritating, veil clinging to everything in Gideon Bartholomew Thorne's small workshop. Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the cobblestones of Oakhaven, painting the gabled roofs and wisteria-draped balconies in hues of amber and rose. But inside, Gideon was lost in the rhythmic rasp of his hand plane against a length of cherry wood. He found a solace in the work, a quiet meditation in the shaping and smoothing. He needed it, especially today.

He'd been working on the same commission for weeks â€“ a cradle for Elara Meadowsweet, the baker's daughter, who was expecting her first child come spring. It should have been a joyful project, a symbol of new beginnings. But Gideon couldn't shake the gnawing feeling of unease that had settled in his stomach since the strange symbols started appearing around Oakhaven, scrawled in charcoal on the sides of buildings and etched into the bark of the ancient oak tree in the town square. At first, people dismissed them as the work of bored teenagers, but Gideon recognized something far more sinister in their intricate geometry, something that whispered of forgotten lore and things best left undisturbed.

**Setting:**

*   **Town:** Oakhaven, a quaint and relatively isolated village nestled in a valley, surrounded by rolling hills and a dense, ancient forest.
*   **Time:** Late 1800s (this can be adjusted slightly depending on the feel you want).
*   **Atmosphere:** Initially idyllic and peaceful, but with an undercurrent of growing unease and suspicion due to the appearance of the mysterious symbols. Oakhaven has a close-knit community feel.
*   **Gideon's Workshop:** Small and cluttered, filled with the tools of his trade: saws, chisels, planes, hammers, and various types of wood. It is attached to his small cottage on the outskirts of the village. The scent of wood shavings is ever-present. There are various projects in progress.

I hope this is helpful and provides a good starting point for your story! Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these aspects.
