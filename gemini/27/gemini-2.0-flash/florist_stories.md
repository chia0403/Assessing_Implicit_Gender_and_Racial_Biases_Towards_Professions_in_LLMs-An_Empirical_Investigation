## Opening:

The scent of hyacinth and damp earth clung to Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne like a second skin. She inhaled deeply, the floral perfume a welcome distraction from the biting wind that snaked through the alleyway beside "The Blooming Branch," her little flower shop in the heart of Willow Creek. Amelia wrestled with the stubborn latch of the overflowing dumpster, its lid groaning in protest like a grumpy old man. The discarded lilies, stems snapped and petals browning, were a melancholy reminder of the Valentine's Day rush that had just ended. She hated throwing them away, each bloom possessing a fleeting beauty, even in its final stages. Still, space was precious, and tomorrow brought a fresh delivery of roses, carnations, and the ethereal beauty of Peruvian lilies, all screaming for attention and vying for a place in her carefully curated displays. As she heaved the last of the wilted flowers into the bin, a glint of something metallic caught her eye in the fading twilight. Not gold, but tarnished silver, nestled amongst the decaying blooms. Amelia, never one to ignore a little mystery, reached in to pluck it out, a prickle of unease crawling up her spine.

## Setting:

Willow Creek was a town perpetually stuck somewhere between a postcard and a forgotten dream. Nestled in a valley between rolling hills, the town was dominated by its ancient, gnarled willow tree, its weeping branches draping like a green curtain over the babbling creek that gave the town its name. The buildings were a charming mishmash of Victorian gingerbread houses, weathered brick shops, and the occasional modern convenience store struggling to blend in. It was a place where everyone knew everyone, gossip travelled faster than the creek current, and secrets were buried deep, like the roots of the ancient willow.

"The Blooming Branch," owned and operated by Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne, was a jewel box of colour and fragrance. Located on Main Street, its large bay window was always brimming with vibrant arrangements, drawing passersby in like bees to nectar. Inside, the shop was a haven of organised chaos. Buckets overflowed with every imaginable flower, from humble daisies to exotic orchids. Sunlight streamed through the stained-glass windows, illuminating the vintage furniture and the delicate glass vases perched on shelves. The air hummed with the quiet buzz of the refrigerated display cases, filled with ready-made bouquets and single, perfect blooms, each carefully chosen and arranged by Amelia's own hands. The scent of flowers permeated everything, a heady mix of sweet and earthy that was both intoxicating and comforting. It was Amelia's sanctuary, her escape, and a small piece of beauty she offered to the world.
