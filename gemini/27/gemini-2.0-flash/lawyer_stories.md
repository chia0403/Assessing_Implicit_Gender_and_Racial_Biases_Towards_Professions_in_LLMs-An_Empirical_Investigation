The midday Florida sun beat down on Amelia Grace Harding’s black suit, making her wish, not for the first time that morning, that she'd opted for linen. Outside the Broward County Courthouse, the air hung thick and heavy, saturated with the scent of exhaust fumes and the faint, metallic tang of the nearby ocean. The sky, usually a vibrant cerulean, was a hazy white, choked with humidity and the promise of a brutal afternoon thunderstorm.

Amelia Grace Harding paused on the courthouse steps, shielding her eyes with a hand still trembling slightly from the morning's cross-examination. Inside, Judge Reynolds was notoriously unforgiving, and today he'd been particularly brutal, questioning her every word and nuance of evidence. She’d felt like a lamb being led to the slaughter, even though, in truth, the case was strong. She just needed to keep it together.

She took a deep breath, trying to regain her composure. The courthouse, a hulking concrete behemoth built in the 1970s, offered little solace. Its sterile, functional architecture was a stark contrast to the lush, tropical beauty that Florida advertised on postcards. It was a place where hopes were dashed, lives were dissected, and fortunes were won and lost, all within the confines of its echoing hallways and harshly lit courtrooms. Amelia, despite her eight years practicing law, still found its atmosphere oppressive.

Across the street, perched on a battered park bench beneath a wilting palm tree, sat Mrs. Eleanor Rodriguez, her client, a small, frail woman whose future rested precariously on Amelia's shoulders. Mrs. Rodriguez nervously clutched a worn rosary, her lips moving silently in prayer. Amelia knew she had to put on a brave face for her, to project the confidence she wasn’t entirely feeling. This was not just a case; it was Mrs. Rodriguez's life savings, her only means of survival after the collapse of her late husband's fraudulent investments.

Amelia took another deep breath, adjusted her purse strap, and started walking towards her client, ready to face whatever the afternoon held. In Broward County, justice was rarely easy, and Amelia Grace Harding knew she had a long fight ahead of her.
