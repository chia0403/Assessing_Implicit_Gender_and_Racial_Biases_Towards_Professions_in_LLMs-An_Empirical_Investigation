Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a counseling psychologist named Dr. Eleanor Vivian Thorne:

**Setting:**

The late afternoon sun, a watery, melancholic gold, slanted through the Venetian blinds of Dr. Eleanor Vivian Thorne's office. The room was intentionally calming: soft, muted blues and greens dominated the color scheme, punctuated by the warm glow of a salt lamp perched precariously on a stack of well-worn books about trauma and resilience.  A small, bubbling fountain provided a gentle white noise, struggling to compete with the city symphony filtering in from the bustling street below - the distant wail of a siren, the rhythmic rumble of a passing bus, the hurried chatter of pedestrians.  The office was located on the seventh floor of a pre-war building in the slightly gentrified, yet still undeniably gritty, Lower East Side of Manhattan. Outside, the building's red brick facade was weathered and worn, a stark contrast to the sleek, modern art gallery next door.

**Opening:**

Dr. Eleanor Vivian Thorne stared at the rapidly cooling cup of chamomile tea on her desk, a half-formed thought clinging to the edge of her consciousness like a stubborn burr.  Her last patient of the day, a young artist named Leo, had just left, his shoulders still carrying the heavy burden of creative frustration and paralyzing self-doubt.  Eleanor knew the feeling well. Not the artist part, of course. She was firmly planted in the practical, science-driven world of psychology, a world she loved, but also one that sometimes felt inadequate against the messy, unpredictable tide of human emotions.  The scent of Leo's distinctive, earthy sandalwood cologne still lingered in the air, a faint, comforting presence in the otherwise sterile environment.  She sighed, pushing the tea aside.  Five minutes. That's all she had before the phone rang, bringing her back to the cold reality of scheduling, insurance claims, and the endless, bureaucratic minutiae that threatened to drown out the quiet, vital work she tried so desperately to do.  But tonight was different. Tonight, the weight felt heavier, the exhaustion deeper. Tonight, she felt…off. It wasn't just the residue of Leo's anxiety clinging to her. It was something else, something… prickling.
