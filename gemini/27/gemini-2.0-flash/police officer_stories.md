## Story Opening:

The rain was a relentless percussionist, drumming on the corrugated iron roof of the abandoned warehouse and mirroring the relentless throb behind Detective Isabella "Izzy" Diaz’s eyes. She’d been staring at the chalk outline for hours, the ghostly impression a silent testament to a life brutally cut short. The air was thick with the cloying scent of damp earth and something else, something metallic and acrid that clung to the back of her throat. She pulled her collar higher, the damp fabric offering little comfort against the biting February chill.

“Anything, Diaz?” A gruff voice sliced through the downpour’s din. Sergeant Miller, his face etched with the same weariness Izzy felt, stood a few feet away, illuminated by the harsh glare of the portable floodlights.

Izzy straightened, forcing herself to focus. "Nothing concrete, Sergeant. Single gunshot wound, chest. No sign of forced entry. Looks professional."

The rain intensified, washing away the flimsy hope Izzy held that she might find something, anything, that would lead her to the killer. Tonight, in this forsaken corner of Providence, Rhode Island, she felt a familiar weight settle on her shoulders – the weight of a city steeped in secrets, and the grim responsibility of unearthing them.

## Setting:

**Providence, Rhode Island, February.** The story takes place in the gritty, industrial district along the Woonasquatucket River. Specifically, the opening scene is located in an abandoned warehouse on Allens Avenue, a bleak stretch known for its decaying factories, strip clubs, and a general sense of neglect. The weather is cold and relentlessly rainy, mirroring the grim atmosphere and the unsettling nature of the crime. The city itself is a character – a historic port city with a rich, complex history and a simmering undercurrent of crime and corruption. The contrast between the city's beautiful architecture and its seedy underbelly will be a recurring theme.
