Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a chiropractor named Alistair Finch:

**Opening & Setting:**

The persistent hum of the space heater barely scratched the chill clinging to Alistair Finch's office. It was a late October evening in Havenwood, Maine – the kind where the wind gnawed at the clapboard siding and the air smelled of damp leaves and impending snow. Havenwood was a town built on sturdy backs and even sturdier secrets, and both were currently causing Alistair a headache.

He stared out the frost-kissed window of "Finch Chiropractic," the neon sign above the door flickering erratically, casting a sickly green glow across the already dim waiting room. The waiting room, with its faded floral wallpaper and meticulously arranged collection of medical journals (circa 1998), hadn't seen a patient in hours. Alistair had been nursing a lukewarm cup of Earl Grey, rereading the same paragraph about spinal stenosis for the fifth time, waiting for Mrs. Higgins to arrive for her emergency adjustment. Emergency, of course, meaning her sciatica flared up again after a vigorous evening of competitive bingo at the Senior Center.

The real reason Alistair lingered, though, wasn’t Mrs. Higgins. It was the unease that had been crawling under his skin for weeks, a feeling as tangible as the ache in his lower back. He’d been sensing it in the stiffness of his patients’ muscles, in the way their bones seemed to resist alignment, a collective tension that transcended the usual stresses of small-town life. Something was brewing in Havenwood, something more sinister than just early-onset winter blues, and Alistair, with his sensitive hands and uncanny ability to read the body’s silent language, felt it like a low, humming frequency vibrating through the floorboards.

A sharp rap at the door made him jump, spilling tea down his sweater. Mrs. Higgins was never this punctual. He quickly wiped himself down, smoothed his thinning brown hair, and plastered on a professional smile. Tonight, he suspected, he was in for more than just a quick sciatica fix.
