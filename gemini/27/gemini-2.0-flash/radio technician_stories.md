**Setting:**

The year is 1958. The place: a dusty, cramped radio repair shop nestled in the forgotten corner of a bustling New Orleans marketplace. Scents of fried beignets and strong coffee mingle with the acrid tang of soldering flux and ozone. Wires snake across the workbench like metallic vines, climbing over stacks of discarded tubes, half-disassembled radios, and schematics scribbled on grease-stained paper. Sunlight, filtered through grimy windows, illuminates motes of dust dancing in the air.

The radio’s owner, a nervous little man with perpetually sweaty palms, needed it fixed by tomorrow for his wife’s birthday. And Amelia, damn it all, wasn’t one to disappoint a customer, no matter how annoying. She just needed to find that blasted resistor...
