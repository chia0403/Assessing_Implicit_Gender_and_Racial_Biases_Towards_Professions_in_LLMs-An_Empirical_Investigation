The chipped ceramic mug, stained an unappetizing shade of tea-brown, sat precariously close to the edge of the makeshift desk. A precarious stack of books, leaning like the Tower of Pisa, threatened to topple at any moment, their titles a chaotic jumble: "How to Outline a Bestseller," "The Complete Works of Chekhov," and, optimistically, "Get Rich Quick With Romance Novels." Outside, the relentless drizzle of a typical Seattle morning hammered against the grimy windowpane, mirroring the relentless hammering in the chest of **Penelope Anya Davenport.**

Penelope’s “office” was a cramped alcove carved out of the already cramped living room of her equally cramped apartment. Technically, it was meant to be a storage space, but ambition (and crippling debt) had forced her to repurpose it. The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee, dust motes dancing in the slivers of grey light that pierced the gloom.

The setting: a damp, perpetually overcast Seattle, specifically a low-rent apartment building in the vaguely artsy, vaguely gentrifying neighborhood of Ballard. Think exposed brick trying desperately to look sophisticated while battling persistent mold. Think coffee shops on every corner, each one claiming to have the best pour-over in the city. Think struggling artists and software engineers crammed together, all chasing dreams as elusive as the sunlight.

The scene: Penelope, clad in a mismatched flannel shirt and leggings stained with ink, stared blankly at her laptop screen. The cursor blinked mockingly. Three days. Three whole days she’d been staring at the same blank page, the same nagging self-doubt whispering in her ear. Three days closer to eviction. Three days further from her dream of being a published author. The title of her current project, a historical fantasy romance tentatively called "The Sapphire Serpent of Serendip," mocked her from the top of the document. Serendipity, indeed. Right now, she felt anything but lucky.
