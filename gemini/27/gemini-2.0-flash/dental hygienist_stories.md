## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** A particularly bleak Tuesday morning in October. Rain lashed against the windows of "Smile Brighter Dental," a modestly sized practice nestled on the corner of Elm Street and Maple Avenue in the perpetually grey town of Port Blossom, Oregon. The air inside was thick with the artificial scent of bubblegum-flavored fluoride and the lingering phantom smell of burnt coffee from Dr. Peterson's forgotten brew.

**Opening:**

The digital clock on the wall ticked relentlessly, mocking her with the agonizing slowness of its progression. 8:57 AM. Three more minutes. Three more minutes until Beatrice Eleanor Humphrey had to plaster on a smile and tackle the dental anxieties of Mrs. Higgins and her collection of problematic fillings. Beatrice sighed, tracing the chipped paint on her desk with a fingernail. She’d always prided herself on her meticulousness, both in her work and in her own oral hygiene. But even the brightest, whitest smile couldn't chase away the damp, creeping dread that seemed to cling to Port Blossom like the morning fog. Today, the dread felt particularly thick, settling heavy on her chest like a lead apron. Maybe it was the weather. Maybe it was Mrs. Higgins. Or maybe, just maybe, it was the unnerving feeling that something in this sleepy little town was about to change – and not for the better.
