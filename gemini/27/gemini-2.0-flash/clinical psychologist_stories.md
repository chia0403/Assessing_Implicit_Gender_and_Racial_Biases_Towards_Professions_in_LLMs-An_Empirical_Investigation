**Setting:** The story opens in the bustling, almost frantic waiting room of Dr. Amelia Grace Hawthorne's private practice in downtown Chicago. Sunlight streams through the floor-to-ceiling windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and the worn edges of the plush, modern furniture. The walls are painted a soothing, albeit generic, shade of pale blue, and abstract art, carefully chosen for its supposed calming properties, hangs in calculated disarray. The sounds of the city – honking cars, distant sirens, and the muffled chatter of pedestrians – bleed through the thick glass, a constant reminder of the chaos Dr. Hawthorne attempts to navigate and tame within these walls.

**Opening:**

Amelia Grace Hawthorne watched a woman frantically pat her purse, her eyes darting around the waiting room as if she’d lost something precious. The woman’s ragged breaths were audible even across the room. It was a familiar scene, one Amelia had witnessed countless times over the past ten years. Anxiety hung in the air, thick and palpable, a shared burden carried by the collection of souls seeking solace within the perceived safety of her practice. Today, though, the air felt different. Heavier. More…charged. She pushed the feeling aside, attributing it to the impending thunderstorm forecast for later that afternoon. As a clinical psychologist, Amelia was trained to analyze, to dissect, to understand the root cause of anxieties. But sometimes, she felt a nagging unease, a whisper of intuition that defied logic, and today was one of those days. A day she suspected wouldn’t end with a tidy diagnosis and a carefully crafted treatment plan. Today felt like the prelude to something…else.
