Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a main character who's a receptionist:

**Setting:**

The reception area of "Innovate Solutions," a mid-sized tech company specializing in cloud-based data security. The office is located on the 12th floor of a modern glass-and-steel building in downtown Seattle. Floor-to-ceiling windows offer a breathtaking view of Puget Sound, usually obscured by the constant drizzle that characterizes the city. The décor is minimalist, leaning towards Scandinavian functionality: light wood furniture, a few carefully placed succulents, and abstract art that probably cost more than Alistair Finch’s entire paycheck. The hum of servers is a constant, almost imperceptible drone beneath the upbeat, but carefully curated, playlist the company insists on playing.

**Opening:**

"Alistair Finch, reception, how may I direct your call?" Alistair asked, his voice practiced and pleasant, even though his insides felt like a tangled ball of ethernet cables. He'd recited that greeting at least fifty times already this morning, and it wasn't even 9:30 AM. He watched as the automatic doors slid open, revealing a man who looked like he'd just stepped out of a particularly grim noir film. Fedora pulled low, trench coat dripping (naturally), and a general aura of 'don't mess with me'. Alistair suppressed a sigh. Another unusual visitor. Innovate Solutions, despite its polished exterior, seemed to attract them like moths to a particularly expensive, energy-efficient lightbulb. He prepared himself for another awkward encounter, forcing another smile as the man approached the desk. "Can I help you, sir?"
