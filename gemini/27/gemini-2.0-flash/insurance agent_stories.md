## Story Opening:

The rain hammered against the tinted glass of Richard Alden's office window, a relentless drumming that echoed the frantic rhythm in his chest. He hated days like this. Not just because they meant a slow trickle of walk-in clients – everyone sensibly stayed inside – but because they reminded him of the sheer, unforgiving chaos of the world. Insurance, after all, was about mitigating that chaos, and on days like this, it felt like he was battling the ocean with a bucket.

Richard Alden, licensed insurance agent and sole proprietor of Alden Assurance Solutions, adjusted his tie, the knot feeling suddenly too tight. He glanced at the clock. 4:58 PM. Just two more minutes until he could lock up, grab a stiff drink at O’Malley’s down the street, and forget the anxieties swirling within him. He just hoped the power stayed on. The thought of wading through paperwork in the flickering light of his phone made his stomach churn.

Then, the bell above the door jingled.

## Setting:

**Alden Assurance Solutions** was a cramped, two-room office located on the second floor of a brick building in the small, unassuming town of Harmony Creek, Ohio. The town was known for its annual Apple Butter Festival and its unnaturally calm atmosphere.

**Room One (Reception):** The outer office was dominated by a worn, maroon vinyl couch that had seen better days, a stack of well-thumbed magazines (mostly about home improvement and RVs), and a chipped, faux-wood reception desk manned (or, more often, unmanned) by Richard. A motivational poster featuring a soaring eagle and the word "PERSISTENCE" hung crookedly on the wall, a testament to Richard's optimism, which often felt more aspirational than actual.

**Room Two (Richard's Office):** Connected by a perpetually squeaking door, Richard's personal office was a chaotic reflection of his internal state. Stacks of paperwork, mostly policy applications and claim forms, threatened to spill over the edges of his cluttered desk. A lone computer monitor glowed dimly, casting a soft light on the framed family photo on his desk: Richard, his wife Sarah, and their daughter Lily, beaming on a sunny beach vacation five years prior. The photo felt both like a lifeline and a painful reminder of the carefree days before the weight of responsibility had truly settled upon his shoulders. A window overlooked Main Street, offering a melancholic view of the rain-slicked sidewalks and the drooping banners advertising the upcoming Apple Butter Festival.
