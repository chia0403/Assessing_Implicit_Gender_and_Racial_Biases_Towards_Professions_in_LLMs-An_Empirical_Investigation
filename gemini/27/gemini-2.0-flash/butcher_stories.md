The biting wind, thick with the scent of brine and damp wool, gnawed at Bartholomew "Barty" Finch as he wrestled the heavy wooden shutters open. Predawn still clung to the cobbled streets of Port Blossom, a coastal town clinging precariously to the edge of the Silver Sea. The salty air, usually invigorating, was today heavy with the promise of a storm, and Barty could already hear the low moan of the approaching squall whistling through the gaps in the eaves of his shop, "Finch's Fine Cuts."

Finch's Fine Cuts itself was a squat, two-story building, its stone facade worn smooth by centuries of relentless weather. A faded, hand-painted sign depicting a plump pig danced precariously above the door, its cheerful expression mocking the grim atmosphere of the morning. Inside, the shop was a familiar comfort. The air was thick with the smell of sawdust, smoked meats, and the faint metallic tang of blood, a comforting perfume to Bartholomew. Rows of gleaming cleavers and knives hung on the wall, each meticulously sharpened and cared for. The large, marble-topped counter, stained with the history of countless cuts and transactions, stood ready for the day's business. Behind it, a vast, walk-in chiller hummed a low, rhythmic tune, promising a cold welcome to the cuts of meat within. Today, however, it felt less like a sanctuary and more like a tomb, cold and waiting. Bartholomew Finch had a feeling this was going to be a difficult day.
