The humid air hung thick and heavy, smelling of sea salt and cheap tanning oil, even inside "Seaside Shears," where Amelia Rodriguez tried valiantly to keep the air conditioning cranked high. Sunlight, brutal and unforgiving, streamed through the large plate-glass window, highlighting the dust motes dancing above the faded floral-print chairs in the waiting area.

The bell above the door jingled merrily, announcing a new arrival, and Amelia straightened her coral-colored smock, plastering on her most welcoming smile. "Good morning!" she chirped, ready to face whatever sun-baked, chlorine-scented hair disaster walked through that door.
