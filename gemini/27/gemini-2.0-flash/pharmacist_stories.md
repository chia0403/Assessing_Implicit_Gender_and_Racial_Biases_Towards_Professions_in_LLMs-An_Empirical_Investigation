The air in the Green Willow Pharmacy hung thick and heavy with the scent of alcohol swabs and the faint, medicinal sweetness of cherry-flavored cough syrup. Outside, the first tentative tendrils of dawn were just beginning to paint the brick buildings of Harmony Creek a soft, hopeful pink, but inside, the fluorescent lights buzzed with relentless efficiency, chasing away any pretense of romance. Eleanor Abigail Beaumont, her hair pulled back in a severe bun that belied the soft curve of her jaw, sighed and adjusted the floral-printed, slightly-too-large lab coat that always seemed to engulf her.

Harmony Creek, Ohio. Population: 3,452. A place where gossip spread faster than the common cold and where the most exciting thing to happen in the last decade was the installation of a new traffic light at the intersection of Main and Elm. Eleanor had inherited the Green Willow from her father, a man who knew every resident’s ailments and anxieties by heart. She loved the town, or at least, she told herself she did. It was safe, predictable, and deeply rooted in her family history. But sometimes, like now, standing amidst the familiar rows of cough drops and antacids, Eleanor felt a nagging sense of being… stuck.

She reached for the ceramic mug emblazoned with the Green Willow logo – a surprisingly charming depiction of a weeping willow, given the overall utilitarian vibe of the pharmacy – and took a long, lukewarm sip of coffee. 5:47 AM. Fifteen minutes until Mr. Henderson arrived for his early-morning prune juice and complained about his arthritis. Another day in Harmony Creek. Another day prescribing, dispensing, and, hopefully, preventing the ailments of her neighbors. Another day of… well, another day.
