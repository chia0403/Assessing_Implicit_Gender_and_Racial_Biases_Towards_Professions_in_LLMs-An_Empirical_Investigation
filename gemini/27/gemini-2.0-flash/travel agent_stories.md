The stale air in the office hung heavy with the ghosts of cancelled honeymoons and postponed family reunions. Rain lashed against the window, mimicking the tempest brewing inside Margaret Eileen O’Malley. Margaret, owner and sole proprietor of "O'Malley's Adventures," rubbed her temples, the fluorescent hum of the overhead lights amplifying the throbbing ache behind her eyes. Business had been abysmal. The internet, that insatiable beast, had swallowed up another chunk of her livelihood, leaving her with a paltry few clients clinging to the romantic notion of a personalized travel experience.

The setting was her office, tucked away on a quiet side street in the small, unassuming town of Willow Creek, Iowa. It was a time capsule of travel agency chic circa 1998. Faded posters of exotic destinations adorned the walls - the turquoise waters of Bora Bora, the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss Alps, the bustling markets of Marrakech, each promising adventure and escape. A spinning globe, its paint chipped and worn, sat precariously on a filing cabinet overflowing with brochures and pamphlets, a testament to the dreams she’d helped bring to life for countless travelers. A half-empty mug of lukewarm coffee, stained with lipstick, sat beside a stack of unpaid bills on her desk. The overall impression was one of a place holding on desperately, clinging to a past that was rapidly fading into a digital future. Outside, the relentless Iowa rain continued its drumming rhythm, a somber soundtrack to Margaret's increasingly desperate reality.
