Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a barber as the main character:

**Setting:**

The late afternoon sun bled orange across the dusty windows of "The Clipper & Comb," a barbershop nestled on a quiet side street in the small, forgotten town of Harmony Creek, Kansas. Outside, the wind, a constant companion in this part of the world, rustled through the dry leaves of a lone cottonwood tree, casting long, dancing shadows on the cracked sidewalk. Inside, the air hung heavy with the mingled scents of bay rum, talcum powder, and the lingering aroma of strong, black coffee. The walls were lined with faded black and white photographs of Harmony Creek's more distinguished citizens, all sporting perfectly coiffed hairstyles from bygone eras. A worn, leather barber chair sat center stage, its chrome gleam dulled by years of loyal service. Beside it stood a cluttered countertop overflowing with well-worn combs, brushes, and a collection of vintage straight razors, each meticulously cleaned and oiled.

**Story Opening:**

The bell above the door jingled, its familiar chime slicing through the comfortable silence. Ezekiel "Zeke" Thornton, the sole proprietor and master barber of The Clipper & Comb, glanced up from the well-thumbed Western he'd been reading. His chair was empty, the only client for the day having left hours ago. A weary sigh escaped his lips as he placed a bookmark on the page. He was a man built like an oak, solid and dependable, with kind eyes that were usually crinkled at the corners from laughter. Today, though, those crinkles were etched a little deeper, reflecting the slow, steady decline of Harmony Creek.

"Afternoon," Zeke greeted, his voice a warm, rumbling baritone. He squinted through the fading light, trying to make out the figure silhouetted in the doorway. It wasn't anyone he recognized, and in a town where he knew just about everyone and their preferred style of sideburns, that was a bit of a surprise.

A tall, slender woman stepped fully inside, and the shadows fell away to reveal a face that looked as lost as the town she had somehow stumbled upon. She clutched a battered leather satchel close to her chest, her eyes wide with a mixture of apprehension and a desperate, flickering hope. Harmony Creek hadn't seen the likes of her in a long time. "Are you Ezekiel Thornton?" she asked, her voice barely a whisper. "I... I was told you might be able to help me."
