The harsh fluorescent lights of Manny’s Auto Repair hummed, a soundtrack to the rhythm of dropped wrenches and the incessant screech of metal on metal. Dust, thick with grime and the ghost of burnt oil, hung in the air, catching the light in tiny, swirling galaxies. Outside, the unforgiving Arizona sun beat down on the asphalt, promising another day of sweltering heat, but inside, under the relatively cool shade of the shop’s corrugated iron roof, Beatrice “Bea” Isabella Rossi wrestled with a particularly stubborn lug nut.

Bea Rossi, her hands calloused and permanently stained with grease despite her best efforts, swore softly under her breath. This ‘87 Bronco was a disaster, a Frankensteinian monster of mismatched parts and questionable decisions courtesy of its previous owner. She'd already spent three hours trying to coax the damn lug nut free, and her patience was wearing thin, much like the treads on the Bronco’s bald tires. This wasn't just a job; it was a battle of wills, a personal affront to her skills. Bea wasn't one to back down from a challenge, especially not one presented by a rusted piece of metal. She gripped the wrench tighter, bracing her feet against the concrete floor, ready for another round.
