Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a manicurist:

**Opening:**

The scent of acetone and ambition hung heavy in the air, a cocktail familiar and comforting to Evangeline "Evie" Bellweather. Today, however, the usual aroma couldn't quite mask the scent of impending doom emanating from Mrs. Eleanor Vandergelt's perfectly coiffed head, perched precariously above a cloud of peach cashmere. Evie plastered on her most professional, yet soothing, smile and gently took Mrs. Vandergelt's left hand, its manicured nails already gleaming a flawless shade of "Ballerina Bliss."

"Mrs. Vandergelt," Evie began, her voice a careful balance of concern and reassurance, "are you alright? You seem... troubled."

Mrs. Vandergelt let out a small, brittle sigh, her diamond rings catching the light. "Troubled, Evangeline? Darling, troubled doesn't even begin to cover it. This weekend is the Vandergelt Charity Gala, and I have a dreadful feeling that something awful is going to happen."

Evie bit back a laugh. The Vandergelt Gala was *always* teetering on the edge of disaster. Last year, it was the rogue peacocks. The year before, a guest had drunkenly declared their undying love for the ice sculpture. But still, something in the way Mrs. Vandergelt spoke, a genuine tremor in her normally unshakeable composure, made Evieâ€™s own nerves prickle.

**Setting:**

The story is set in **"The Polished Parlour,"** a high-end nail salon located on the upper east side of **Manhattan, New York City.**

*   **Interior:** The salon is lavishly decorated, but in a tasteful, understated way. Think muted greys and creams, with pops of rose gold accents. Crystal chandeliers hang from the ceiling, casting a flattering light on the plush velvet chairs at each manicure station. Each station is meticulously organized, with rows of perfectly arranged nail polishes, high-end tools, and sterilized implements. There's a small waiting area with comfortable seating, designer magazines, and complimentary infused water. The overall atmosphere is one of pampered luxury and hushed sophistication.
*   **Exterior:** The salon is located on a prime block, nestled between a boutique clothing store and a renowned bakery. Its window displays feature artfully arranged bottles of polish and miniature sculptures crafted from nail art supplies. A discreet awning bearing the salon's name protects the entrance. The street outside is bustling with well-dressed clientele, luxury cars, and the general hum of city life.

Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any aspect of the setting or continue the story!
