The air in Florence was thick with the aroma of damp terracotta and roasting chestnuts, a familiar November perfume that usually comforted Alessandro Bellini. But today, even the familiar scent couldn't soothe the knot of anxiety twisting in his stomach. He stood on the Ponte Santa Trinita, the Arno swirling darkly beneath, his worn leather portfolio clutched tightly in his hand. Across the river, the Ponte Vecchio shimmered, its gold shops winking like greedy eyes under the overcast sky.

Alessandro Bellini, son of a master furniture maker and grandson of a fisherman, wasn't supposed to be here, in Florence, vying for a place in the prestigious Accademia di Belle Arti. He was supposed to be carving intricate designs into cypress chests, breathing in the scent of sawdust, not nervously eyeing the imposing stone facade of the Accademia looming a few blocks away. He'd always been more comfortable with a paintbrush in hand, the vibrant colors of his dreams blossoming onto canvas, but his father, though proud, didn't see the value in art. "A hobby, Alessandro," he'd said, his voice rough but kind, "not a living." Yet, Alessandro, fueled by a burning passion he couldn't ignore, had saved every spare lira and stolen every free moment to paint, nurturing the hope that one day, he could make a life of it. That day, he prayed, was today.
