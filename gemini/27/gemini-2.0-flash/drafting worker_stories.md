Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a story with a main character who's a drafting worker:

**Story Opening:**

The rhythmic whir of the electric eraser was the closest thing Beatrice Eleanor Davies had to a lullaby in this place. It chewed away at the ghost of a miscalculated load-bearing wall, a tiny pink cloud of rubber detritus swirling around her meticulous hand. Outside, the late afternoon sun painted the Chicago skyline in shades of bruised orange and defiant gold, a view most people in this city would kill for. But Beatrice barely noticed. She was too focused on making sure the "C" in "Concourse Level" was perfectly aligned on sheet A-17, revision three.

It was always revision three. Never revision one. Never the satisfying thump of a job well done on the first try.

**Setting:**

The setting is a mid-sized architectural firm, "Herrick & Finch," located on the 27th floor of a glass-and-steel skyscraper in downtown Chicago. The office is a study in controlled chaos. Rows of drafting tables, illuminated by harsh fluorescent lights, are littered with blueprints, coffee rings, and half-eaten sandwiches. The air smells faintly of ink, ozone from the blueprint machine, and simmering frustration. The walls are decorated with framed architectural renderings of projects past, testaments to the firm's (somewhat faded) glory days.

Beatrice’s specific workspace is a small, cluttered corner squeezed between the blueprint machine and the perpetually overflowing recycling bin. Her drafting table is an antique, a relic from a bygone era when architects still sketched with charcoal and spoke in hushed tones about the "sacred art of building." She’s kept it out of sentimentality, as it was her grandfather's. It's a constant reminder of the beauty that could be found in the painstaking craft of drafting, a beauty that often seemed lost in the digital efficiency of the modern world.
