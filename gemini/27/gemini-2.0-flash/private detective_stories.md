## Story Opening:

The rain hammered against the grimy window of Arthur Finch's office, each drop a tiny hammer blow against his already frayed nerves. He watched it trace convoluted paths down the glass, mirroring the tangled threads of his current case: a missing heiress, a jealous fiancé, and a whole heap of money that had seemingly vanished into thin air. He took another long pull from his lukewarm coffee, the bitter taste a familiar comfort in a city that rarely offered anything sweet. Outside, the neon sign of the "Blue Moon Diner" flickered with a weary buzz, casting a sickly blue glow that did little to brighten the gloom. He leaned back in his creaky chair, the springs groaning in protest, and stared at the half-finished crossword puzzle on his desk. Nine letters. "Double-crossing lowlife." He knew the answer, he just couldn't bring himself to write it down. It was a little too on the nose.

## Setting:

Arthur Finch's office occupied the fifth floor of a pre-war building on the less-than-glamorous edge of downtown Chicago. The building, appropriately named "The Atlas," was a monument to forgotten grandeur, its once-gleaming facade now stained with grime and neglect. The interior was no better. The hallways smelled perpetually of stale cigarette smoke and despair, and the elevator, a temperamental antique, was more likely to get you stuck than to deliver you to your destination.

Inside Arthur's office, the decor was a testament to a man struggling to stay afloat. The walls were painted a faded beige, chipped and peeling in places. A threadbare Persian rug, purchased at a pawn shop for a steal, covered most of the scarred hardwood floor. Bookshelves overflowed with well-worn paperbacks – Raymond Chandler, Dashiell Hammett, anything that offered a glimpse into the minds of men gone bad. A dented filing cabinet, its drawers overflowing with case files and unpaid bills, sat in the corner, a silent witness to Arthur's often-fruitless endeavors. The only hint of personality was a framed photograph on his desk: a black and white shot of a smiling woman with kind eyes, a woman Arthur hadn't seen in far too long. The whole place had the air of a comfortable, well-worn, and slightly depressing haven for a man who preferred the company of shadows and secrets.
