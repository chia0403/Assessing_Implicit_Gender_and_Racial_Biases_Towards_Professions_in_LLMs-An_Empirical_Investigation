The relentless hammering of rain against the corrugated iron roof was doing little to soothe Dr. Eliza Maeve Callahan's frayed nerves. The tinny clang, punctuated by the mournful bleating of a ewe in distress, threatened to drive her completely mad. She swiped a stray wisp of auburn hair from her forehead with the back of a muddy glove, leaving a fresh streak of grime on her skin.

The setting was the Callahan Family Farm, a sprawling, stubbornly traditional sheep and cattle property nestled deep in the heart of the Snowy Mountains of New South Wales, Australia. Eliza, having begrudgingly inherited the ramshackle operation after her father's passing, had transformed one of the dilapidated shearing sheds into a makeshift veterinary clinic. The scent of lanolin, antiseptic, and desperation hung heavy in the air, a pungent cocktail that was both familiar and deeply unsettling. Sunlight, when it dared break through the ever-present cloud cover, streamed through gaps in the weatherboard walls, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air like tiny, restless spirits. This morning, however, the only illumination came from a bare, buzzing fluorescent tube that cast a sickly yellow glow over the scene. A chipped enamel wash basin, overflowing with used surgical gloves and cotton wool, sat precariously on a rickety wooden table. Eliza's tools – well-worn, but meticulously maintained – lay spread out on a sterilized cloth, gleaming faintly under the harsh light. Outside, the storm raged on, a relentless reminder of the isolation that had both drawn her back to the farm and threatened to suffocate her ambition. And inside, a ewe labored, her bleats growing increasingly frantic, adding another layer to Eliza's mounting anxiety.
