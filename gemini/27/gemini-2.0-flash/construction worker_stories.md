The biting wind whipped across the skeletal steel frame, stinging the exposed skin of Jedidiah Michael Blackwood’s face. High above the city, perched precariously on a half-finished beam, Jedidiah tightened his grip, the rough steel biting into the calluses of his gloved hands. He squinted against the glare of the late afternoon sun reflecting off the glass canyons below, a landscape he was slowly, painstakingly, building.

The site was the "Phoenix Tower," a gargantuan project rising in the heart of the revitalized industrial district of Riverview. Riverview itself was a city in transition, a patchwork quilt of crumbling brick warehouses and gleaming new skyscrapers, clinging to the muddy banks of the serpentine River Avon. The air, usually thick with the smell of diesel and exhaust fumes, today held a metallic tang, a testament to the ongoing construction that thrummed beneath Jedidiah’s boots. This tower, destined to be the tallest building in the state, was Riverview's bid for a new identity, a symbol of its resurgence. And Jedidiah, a man who knew the weight of brick and steel in his bones, was helping to raise it, one beam, one bolt, one day at a time.
