## Story Opening:

The wind, a persistent, mournful song, whipped across Amelia Beatrice Harrison's face as she wrestled with the stubborn latches of the Cessna 172's cockpit door. Dawn clung to the horizon, painting the sky in bruised purples and reluctant oranges. Another day, another flight, another attempt to outrun the ghosts that gnawed at the edges of her mind.

"Bloody thing," she muttered under her breath, finally snapping the latch free with a grunt. The crisp, high-altitude air bit at her exposed skin, a stark contrast to the humid, heavy memories she carried with her.

## Setting:

Amelia was standing on the tarmac of the **Alpine Airfield**, a small, privately owned airstrip carved into the rugged landscape of the **Swiss Alps**. Towering peaks, shrouded in a permanent veil of snow, formed a majestic, unforgiving backdrop. Tiny chalets dotted the slopes in the distance, their lights flickering like lonely stars in the pre-dawn gloom. The air crackled with a raw, untamed energy, a constant reminder of the precariousness of life in this isolated corner of the world. A single windsock, tethered to a rickety pole, strained against the biting wind, pointing resolutely towards the snow-capped peak of the Eiger, a silent sentinel guarding the valley below.
