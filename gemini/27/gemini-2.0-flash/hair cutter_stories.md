Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a main character who's a hair cutter:

**Setting:**

The fluorescent lights hummed a dissonant tune above the chipped, teal Formica counter of "The Clipper Ship," a small, somewhat dilapidated barbershop nestled between a laundromat and a discount tax service on a forgotten corner of Grand Avenue in the working-class suburb of Harmony Heights, Illinois.  The air, thick with the ghost of hairspray and the lingering aroma of Old Spice, had permeated the very fabric of the space.  Yellowed nautical charts, dotted with faded pinholes, hung crookedly on the walls, a testament to the previous owner's misguided attempts at themed decor. The linoleum floor, a swirling pattern of brown and beige, bore the scuffs and scrapes of countless hurried footsteps.  Outside, the November sky pressed down like a damp wool blanket, promising an evening of sleet and misery.

**Story Opening:**

Barnaby Finch, not Barnaby "The Barber" Finch, or Barnaby "The Shear Genius" Finch, just Barnaby Finch, wiped down the faux-leather seat of his worn barber's chair with a sigh. The spray bottle hissed a little too loudly in the otherwise quiet shop, and Barnaby’s reflection stared back from the mirror, a middle-aged man with thinning, mousy brown hair he’d styled himself in a hopeless attempt to look younger. He hated Thursdays. Thursdays were slow. Thursdays were for agonizing about the bills piling up on the counter next to the register and the looming threat of the corporate chain "ClipJoint 2000" opening across the street.

He glanced at the chipped porcelain clock above the doorway. 4:17 PM. Nearly quitting time, or what passed for it in this sad corner of the world. He just knew no one else would walk through that door today. The bell above the door jingled, announcing someone else’s arrival, causing Barnaby to almost jump out of his skin. He glanced up, a forced smile already plastered on his face.
