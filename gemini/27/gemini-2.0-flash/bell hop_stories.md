**Setting:** The grand lobby of the Hotel Alexandria, in its heyday of 1938. The air hums with the low murmur of conversations in a dozen languages, the clinking of champagne glasses, and the insistent, rhythmic tapping of Fred Astaire on the radio emanating from the concierge's desk. Sunlight streams through the enormous arched windows, illuminating swirling dust motes dancing in the air, and glinting off the polished brass of the luggage trolleys. The scent of lilies, mingled with the faint but undeniable aroma of cigar smoke, hangs heavy and opulent. The Alexandria is a monument to Art Deco extravagance, a place where fortunes are made and broken, secrets are whispered, and dreams are realized â€“ or shattered.

**Opening:**

Percival Reginald Featherstonehaugh III adjusted the brim of his perfectly creased cap, the weight of his grandfather's expectations settling on his shoulders with the same familiar pressure as the heavy brass buttons of his uniform. He sighed, a wisp of a sound barely audible above the bustling lobby of the Hotel Alexandria. It wasn't exactly the life he'd imagined for himself - Percival had always fancied himself a poet, perhaps even a playwright, not a bellhop. But Grandfather Featherstonehaugh, owner of a substantial shipping empire and staunch believer in earning one's keep, had decreed that a summer "acquaintance" with the "real world" was just what young Percival needed before embarking on his "frivolous" artistic pursuits. And so, here he was, Percival Reginald Featherstonehaugh III, bellhop extraordinaire, ready to serve the whims and fancies of the Alexandria's glittering clientele. He just hoped he could make it through the season without dropping someone's Louis Vuitton or, worse, accidentally insulting a visiting dignitary. The day was barely beginning, and already, he felt a tremor of impending chaos ripple through the air. And Percival Reginald Featherstonehaugh III, despite his privileged upbringing, had a sneaking suspicion that this summer was going to be anything but boring.
