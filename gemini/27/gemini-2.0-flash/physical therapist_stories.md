## Opening and Setting:

The biting March wind whipped through the gaps in the aged brick of the Boston brownstone, carrying the scent of saltwater and exhaust fumes. Inside, Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Vance, Physical Therapist, shivered despite the thick wool sweater she wore. Sunlight, weak and watery, struggled to penetrate the grime on the windowpanes of her cramped office on the first floor. The room, a converted parlor of the brownstone, was a testament to functionality over aesthetics. A well-worn examination table dominated the space, flanked by a metal cabinet overflowing with resistance bands, foam rollers, and oddly shaped orthopedic braces. Charts, overflowing with handwritten notes and insurance codes, teetered precariously on a small, dented desk.

Ellie rubbed her perpetually cold hands together, the gesture doing little to thaw the chill that seemed to seep into her bones from the perpetually damp walls. She glanced at the clock above the door – 9:57 AM. Three more minutes until her first patient, Mr. Silas Abernathy, a retired history professor whose post-hip replacement recovery was proving…challenging. Ellie sighed, the sound echoing in the small space. She truly loved her work, helping people regain their mobility and independence after injuries or surgeries. But the relentless paperwork, the demanding insurance companies, and the constant battle against the building's inherent disrepair were slowly chipping away at her resolve. Today, however, felt different. There was a heavier weight in her chest, a premonition of something unexpected, something…unsettling.
