The humid air hung thick and heavy, smelling of sun-baked hay and something vaguely…lemony. A persistent mosquito buzzed past Clara Bellwether’s ear, and she slapped at it absently, leaving a smear of damp earth on her tanned forearm. Clara inhaled deeply, the familiar scent grounding her. This was home. This was where she belonged.

Clara was the Head Animal Caretaker at the Whispering Pines Wildlife Sanctuary, nestled deep in the heart of the Redwood National Park. It wasn't a fancy zoo with paved paths and gift shops. Whispering Pines was rough around the edges, a haven carved out of the wilderness where injured or orphaned animals were rehabilitated and, whenever possible, released back into the wild.

The setting was a tapestry of vibrant green. Ancient redwood trees, their bark the color of rust and their crowns scraping the sky, surrounded the sanctuary. Sunlight dappled through the dense canopy, illuminating patches of fern-covered ground and sparkling on the surface of the creek that snaked its way through the property. The sounds were a symphony of nature: the rush of the creek, the chirping of unseen birds, the rustling of leaves in the breeze, and, faintly in the distance, the mournful howl of a coyote. This morning, however, the symphony was punctuated by a persistent, rhythmic banging coming from one of the enclosures – the one housing a particularly stubborn, and surprisingly strong, juvenile black bear named Barry. Clara sighed. Another Monday.
