## Story Opening:

The rhythmic clang of Mrs. Higgins' cast iron radiator punctuated Leo Maxwell's early morning like a rusty cymbal crash. He sighed, pulled the thick wool blanket tighter around his shoulders, and burrowed deeper into his pillow. 6:30 AM. Too damn early for anything, especially considering he'd spent the previous evening unclogging a drainpipe in the basement of the perpetually damp O'Malley Funeral Home. He shuddered, remembering the oddly sweet and floral smell that had lingered in the air, even after he'd scrubbed his hands raw.

He knew he should get up. Mrs. Higgins was a creature of habit, and her radiator was a creature of drama. It started its symphony of noise exactly at 6:30 AM every Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday. And if Leo wasn't there by 7:00 AM sharp, armed with his trusty wrench and a patient smile, he'd face the wrath of a woman who could make even the toughest construction worker crumble.

With a groan that matched the radiator's mournful clangs, Leo Maxwell, licensed plumber and purveyor of questionable jokes, reluctantly threw back the covers and faced the dawn. He knew, with a certainty that went beyond logic, that Mrs. Higgins' radiator was just the beginning of another long, wet, and probably weird day.

## Setting:

The story unfolds in the fictional, slightly rundown, but charmingly historic town of Oakhaven, nestled in the rolling hills of upstate New York. Oakhaven is the kind of place where everyone knows everyone, where the local diner still serves bottomless coffee for a dollar fifty, and where the biggest news of the week is usually about whose cat climbed the tallest oak tree in the town square.

Leo Maxwellâ€™s apartment is above "The Rusty Mug," a dive bar he frequents perhaps a little too often. His living space is small, functional, and perpetually in a state of organized chaos. Plumbing tools share space with half-finished model airplanes, stacks of well-worn paperback novels, and a collection of vintage radios he plans to restore "one of these days." The walls are painted a questionable shade of avocado green, a relic from a bygone era, and the aroma of coffee and pipe tobacco perpetually hangs in the air. His small balcony overlooks Main Street, offering him a front-row seat to the daily dramas and quirky characters that make Oakhaven, well, Oakhaven.
