The stale, floral potpourri hanging lopsidedly in the opulent hallway did little to disguise the lingering scent of Monsieur Dubois' cigar smoke. Beatrice Anne Holloway sighed, adjusting the worn strap of her apron over her shoulder. Seven years she'd been a housekeeper at Chateau Dubois, and seven years she'd been battling that same infernal smell. It clung to the velvet drapes, permeated the antique furniture, and stubbornly embedded itself within the very fabric of the sprawling, three-story estate nestled amidst the rolling vineyards of Bordeaux, France.

The Chateau itself was a beast of weathered stone, its history etched into every crack and crevice. Ivy snaked up its walls, softening the harsh angles, while gargoyles leered from the eaves, their stone eyes perpetually fixed on the sprawling grounds below. Sunlight streamed through the leaded glass windows, casting geometric patterns on the polished parquet floors, but even the beauty of the light couldn't quite dispel the air of hushed antiquity, the feeling that the Chateau held secrets older than Beatrice herself.

Not because of the dust - though there was plenty of it, clinging to the thousands of ancient books lining the shelves - but because of the unsettling feeling she always got within its walls. It felt like she was being watched, judged by the long-dead authors whose words still echoed within the leather-bound pages. And today, that feeling was particularly strong.
