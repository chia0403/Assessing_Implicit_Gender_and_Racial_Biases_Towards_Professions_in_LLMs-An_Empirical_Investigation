The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous lullaby over Dr. Eleanor Ainsworthâ€™s head, a sound she'd become so accustomed to she barely registered it anymore. It was 7:15 AM on a Monday, and the linoleum floor of Maplewood Elementary already bore the scuffs of early-bird teachers lugging boxes of textbooks and precocious children bouncing in with boundless energy.

Stacks of folders threatened to topple from the shelves, art projects overflowed from the designated bin, and a rainbow assortment of stress balls sat perched on her desk, like silent, squishy guardians. Eleanor, still bleary-eyed despite her double shot of espresso, ran a hand through her perpetually messy auburn hair and surveyed the scene. Today, the chaos felt particularly oppressive. Today, she was facing a week that promised to be a minefield of meltdowns, IEP meetings, and parental anxieties. Today, she desperately needed another cup of coffee.
