The salt spray stung Dr. Eleanor Vance's face as she wrestled the stubborn kayak onto the rocky shore.  The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum in the rapidly darkening sky, cast long shadows across the jagged cliffs of the Maine coast.  Seabirds wheeled overhead, their cries a mournful counterpoint to the rhythmic crash of waves against the basalt.  Eleanor, her OT bag – surprisingly buoyant, given its contents – already slung over her shoulder, surveyed the scene with a practiced eye.  The cottage perched precariously on the cliff edge, its weathered grey wood a stark contrast to the vibrant green of the wind-whipped pines clinging to the hillside, was her next patient's home.  It wasn't the typical setting for occupational therapy, but then again, neither was her patient, a reclusive artist with a penchant for cliff-side living and a broken arm.
