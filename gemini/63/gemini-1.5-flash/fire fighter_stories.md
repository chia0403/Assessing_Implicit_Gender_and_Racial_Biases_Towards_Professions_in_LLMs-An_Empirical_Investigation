The acrid bite of woodsmoke stung Captain Evelyn "Evie" Blackwood's nostrils, a familiar companion on nights like these.  The air hung thick and heavy, a suffocating blanket woven from pine needles and the charred remains of what was once a vibrant stand of Douglas fir.  Crimson and orange flames licked at the inky sky, casting dancing shadows that writhed and contorted across the rugged terrain of the Cascade Mountains.  Around Evie, the cacophony of crackling fire, hissing water, and the strained breaths of her exhausted crew was a stark counterpoint to the otherwise silent, starless night.  The emergency call had come in just after midnight â€“ a wildfire, sparked by a downed power line, rapidly consuming hundreds of acres near the remote logging town of Timberline.  Evie's boots crunched on the uneven ground, littered with scorched earth and the skeletal remains of trees, as she surveyed the scene, the harsh glare of the fire reflecting in her determined, steel-grey eyes.
