The biting November wind whipped at Elias Thorne's already chapped lips, stinging them like a swarm of tiny, icy bees.  He pulled his worn, threadbare scarf higher, the coarse wool scratching against his stubbled chin.  Below him, the skeletal frame of the new skyscraper clawed at the bruised, twilight sky â€“ a concrete and steel behemoth rising from the heart of downtown Chicago.  The city, a symphony of distant sirens and rumbling traffic, was a blurry tapestry of lights against the gathering darkness, a stark contrast to the cold, metallic world Elias inhabited for twelve hours a day, six days a week.  His steel-toed boots crunched on the frost-covered steel grating, the sound swallowed by the city's relentless hum.  Tonight, however, the usual rhythm of construction was broken.  A silence, heavy and unnatural, hung in the air, punctuated only by the rhythmic clang of his own heart, a frantic drum against the backdrop of the city's sleeplessness.
