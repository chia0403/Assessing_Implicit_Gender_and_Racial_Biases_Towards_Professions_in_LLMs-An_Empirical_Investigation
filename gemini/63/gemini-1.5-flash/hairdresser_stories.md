The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume only Aurelia "Ria" Blackwood could seem to conjure.  Her salon, "Shear Brilliance," nestled on the cobbled side street of  Rue de la Fontaine, was less a business and more a meticulously curated sanctuary.

Outside, the Parisian autumn painted the world in shades of burnt orange and deep crimson, a perfect foil to the crisp white towels folded origami-style on the gleaming stainless steel countertops.  Today, however, the usual calm was shattered.  A frantic knock echoed through the salon, followed by a sharp, high-pitched voice that sliced through the gentle hum of the hairdryer like a rusty saw.
