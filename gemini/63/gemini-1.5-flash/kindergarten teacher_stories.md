The chipped paint of the "Welcome to Ms. Eleanor Vance's Class!" sign flaked onto the vibrant, slightly sticky linoleum floor.  Dust motes, illuminated by the weak autumnal sun slanting through the classroom window, danced in the air like tiny, excited children.  It was a Tuesday, and for Ms. Eleanor Vance, Tuesday meant glitter.  Inevitably, glitter.  This Tuesday, however, promised a particularly spectacular glitter explosion, thanks to the upcoming Thanksgiving craft project: miniature cornucopias overflowing with construction paper cranberries and – you guessed it – enough glitter to coat a small flock of turkeys.  The air smelled faintly of glue, crayons, and the lingering sweetness of spilled apple juice from an earlier spill involving a particularly enthusiastic three-year-old named Timmy.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune, but inside Ms. Vance’s classroom, a cheerful chaos reigned, a miniature city humming with the high-pitched chatter of twenty-five five-year-olds.
