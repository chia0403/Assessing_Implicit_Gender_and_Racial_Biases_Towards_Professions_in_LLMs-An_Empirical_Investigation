The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Hernandez's hair across her face as she surveyed the almost deserted soccer field.  Fallen leaves, the color of burnt umber and rust, crunched under her worn cleats.  Floodlights, pale halos in the gathering dusk, illuminated the skeletal goalposts, casting long, skeletal shadows across the slick, muddy turf.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and woodsmoke drifting from the distant houses huddled on the edge of Willow Creek, a small, forgotten town nestled deep in the Appalachian foothills.  Amy, head coach of the Willow Creek Wildcats U16 girls’ soccer team, pulled her thick scarf tighter around her neck, a shiver not entirely from the cold crawling down her spine.  Tonight’s practice had been cancelled – a casualty of the unexpected blizzard warning – but she couldn't shake the feeling that something else, something far more unsettling, had blown in with the storm.
