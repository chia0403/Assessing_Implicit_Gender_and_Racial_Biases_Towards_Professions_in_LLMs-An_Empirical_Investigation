The scent of rain-soaked petrichor mingled with the heady perfume of jasmine and lilies, clinging to the damp cobblestones of Nightingale Lane like a second skin.  Rain lashed against the leaded windows of "Petals & Promises," a tiny florist's shop tucked away between a crooked bookshop and a perpetually-empty bakery.  Inside, the air was warm and fragrant, a stark contrast to the blustery October evening outside.  Amelia Rose Hawthorne, her fingers stained a delicate shade of emerald from arranging a cascade of orchids, hummed a low, melancholic tune as she worked.  The flickering gaslight cast long shadows across the vibrant blooms, highlighting the tiny droplets clinging to their velvety petals, each one a miniature jewel.
