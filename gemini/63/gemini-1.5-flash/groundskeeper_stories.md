The November wind, a spiteful, icy hand, clawed at Elias Thorne's weathered face as he wrestled with a stubborn oak branch.  Dead leaves, the colour of rust and decay, swirled around his worn boots, clinging to the thick wool of his trousers. Elias, groundskeeper of Blackwood Manor for the past twenty-seven years, was used to the November chill, used to the relentless work, used to the silence that settled over the sprawling estate like a shroud after the last of the summer visitors departed.  Blackwood Manor itself loomed above him, a gothic behemoth of grey stone and shadowed windows, its turrets disappearing into the swirling mist that clung to the valley like a persistent ghost.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and decaying vegetation, a perfume only a groundskeeper could truly appreciate, or perhaps tolerate.  This year, however, the silence feltâ€¦different.  Heavier.  More ominous.
