The pre-dawn chill bit at Elias Thorne’s cheeks as he unlocked the bakery’s heavy oak door.  Dust motes, disturbed by the faintest crack of light filtering through the grimy windowpanes, danced in the gloom of “The Gilded Crust,” a name ironically at odds with its current state of faded grandeur.  Elias, a man whose flour-dusted apron concealed a heart as warm as his oven, ran a hand over the chipped paint of the counter, the cool surface a stark contrast to the warmth radiating from the slumbering brick oven.  The air, thick with the promise of yeast and sugar, held the ghosts of countless loaves and pastries, a testament to generations of bakers who had kneaded their dreams into the very fabric of this venerable, if slightly dilapidated, building.  Outside, the cobblestone streets of Oakhaven were still hushed, the only sound the distant caw of a crow, a mournful counterpoint to the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Elias’s own heart, already anticipating the day's baking challenges.
