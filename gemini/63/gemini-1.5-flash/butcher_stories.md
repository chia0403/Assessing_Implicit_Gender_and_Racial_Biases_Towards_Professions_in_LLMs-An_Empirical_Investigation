The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of blood, sawdust, and something faintly sweet – a peculiar perfume only a butcher like Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield could appreciate.  It clung to the rough-hewn wooden counters of his shop, "Barty's Best Cuts," clinging even more stubbornly to Barty himself, a permanent stain on his apron as dark and rich as the prime rib hanging proudly behind the glass.  The shop, nestled on the cobbled side street of Grimsborough, was a cavern of shadows and gleaming steel, a place where the rhythmic clang of cleaver on bone was the soundtrack to Barty’s life, a life lived amongst the primal scent of freshly slaughtered meat.  Outside, a late October wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the dusty windowpanes and hinting at the coming winter, a season as unforgiving as the business Barty knew so well.
