The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Amy” Hernandez’s auburn hair across her face as she hurried down the snow-dusted cobblestone streets of St. Ives.  The scent of brine and woodsmoke, usually comforting, was overwhelmed tonight by the metallic tang of blood, a scent that clung to the damp air like a shroud.  St. Ives, a picturesque Cornish fishing village usually postcard-perfect, was shrouded in an unnatural gloom, the gaslights struggling to pierce the swirling grey. Amy, a physician's assistant at the tiny, centuries-old St. Ives General Hospital, pulled her thick wool coat tighter, the collar scratching against her already chapped cheeks.  The emergency call had come in just minutes ago, cryptic and urgent: “Fisherman. Harbour.  Badly hurt.”  Her breath plumed white in the frigid air, mirroring the anxiety tightening in her chest.  This wasn't her first night facing the harsh realities of coastal life, but something about the raw fear in the dispatcher's voice sent a shiver down her spine.
