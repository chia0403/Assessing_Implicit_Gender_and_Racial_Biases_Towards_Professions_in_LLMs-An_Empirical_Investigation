The battered chrome of "Betsy," Jeremiah "Jerry" Stone's eighteen-wheeler, gleamed faintly under the bruised purple of a Wyoming sunset.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of ochre and rust, danced across the cracked asphalt of I-80, swirling around the lonely expanse of sagebrush and scrub that stretched to the horizon like a wrinkled, faded carpet.  The air, thin and crisp, carried the scent of pine and something indefinably wild, a perfume only the high desert could offer.  Jerry, his face etched with the map of a thousand miles and a lifetime spent battling the elements, watched them spin, a weary sigh escaping his lips.  He'd been on the road for three days, the hum of Betsy's engine a constant companion to the gnawing loneliness that had become as familiar as his own shadow.  His next delivery was due in Cheyenne, but the setting sun painted a picture of delay, a promise of another night under the vast, indifferent sky.
