The humid air hung heavy, thick as the perfume of a thousand overripe mangoes, clinging to Amelia Hernandez like a second skin.  Sweat beaded on her forehead, reflecting the harsh glare of the midday sun beating down on the cobblestone streets of Antigua, Guatemala.  The vibrant colours of the colonial architecture – faded ochre, bruised purple, and a startling turquoise – seemed almost to vibrate in the heat.  Amelia adjusted the worn strap of her satchel, its contents – a battered guidebook, a half-eaten chocolate bar, and a collection of slightly damp postcards – shifting with the movement.  Today's tour, a small group of Americans eager to soak up the city's history and charm, was already fifteen minutes late, and the oppressive heat was threatening to melt even Amelia's usually unflappable patience.  She sighed, pushing a stray strand of dark hair behind her ear, and glanced at the ornate clock tower looming over the Plaza Mayor, its bells promising a cacophony of midday chimes any minute now.
