The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face as he leaned against the railing of the ferry, the wind whipping his charcoal-grey overcoat around him like a restless spirit.  Below, the churning grey waters of the Puget Sound churned, separating the vibrant, bustling city of Seattle from Bainbridge Island, a place of hushed forests and silent, watchful mountains.  Elias, a man whose life was usually measured in precise angles and meticulously balanced blueprints, found himself oddly unsettled by the chaotic beauty of the churning sea.  His usual calm, almost clinical demeanour was replaced by a nervous energy, a feeling entirely at odds with the meticulously organised portfolio case resting at his feet, containing the plans for what could be his most ambitious project yet â€“ the restoration of the crumbling Blackwood Manor, a gothic masterpiece perched precariously on the island's windswept cliffs.
