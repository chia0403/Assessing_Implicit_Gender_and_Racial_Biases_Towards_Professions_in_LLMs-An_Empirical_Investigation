The rusty barber's pole outside creaked a mournful tune in the blustery November wind, its faded red, white, and blue stripes almost swallowed by the encroaching gloom.  Inside, Elias Thorne, a man whose life seemed as weathered and worn as the worn leather of his barber's chair, hummed a low, melancholic tune to himself.  Dust motes, illuminated by a single, flickering bulb hanging precariously from the ceiling, danced in the air above the chipped porcelain sink. The scent of Bay Rum and something faintly metallic, perhaps old blood, clung to the worn wooden walls of Thorne's Tonsorial Parlour, a business as steadfast and unchanging as the ancient oak tree visible through the grimy windowpane.  Outside, the town of Havenwood, nestled deep in the Appalachian foothills, was already surrendering to the early darkness.
