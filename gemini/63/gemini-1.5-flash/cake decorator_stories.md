The air hung thick and sweet in "Flour Power," a bakery so crammed with sugary delights it felt like stepping inside a giant, edible gingerbread house.  The scent of vanilla bean, almond extract, and faintly burnt caramel clung to everything, from the meticulously-arranged pastries lining the glass counter to the flour-dusted aprons hanging on the back wall.  Behind the counter, amidst a chaotic ballet of rolling pins and piping bags, stood Seraphina Antoinette Bellweather, her brow furrowed in concentration as she meticulously crafted a cascade of buttercream roses onto a three-tiered wedding cake.  The buttercream, a delicate shade of blush pink, shimmered under the warm glow of the bakery's incandescent lights, a stark contrast to the storm brewing outside, a furious tempest that rattled the old shop's windows.  Seraphina, however, remained oblivious, completely absorbed in her sugary masterpiece.
