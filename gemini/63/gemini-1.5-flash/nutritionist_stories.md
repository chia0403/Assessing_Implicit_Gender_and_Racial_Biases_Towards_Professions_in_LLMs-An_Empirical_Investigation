The fluorescent lights of the "Nourish & Thrive" clinic hummed a monotonous tune, a stark counterpoint to the vibrant chaos of the overflowing herb garden visible through the large bay window.  Dr. Eleanor Vance, a nutritionist whose name was practically synonymous with healthy living in the quaint coastal town of Seabrook, sighed. The scent of rosemary and sea salt, usually so calming, did little to soothe her frayed nerves this morning.  A mountain of paperwork – client files, supplier invoices, and the dreaded quarterly tax reports – loomed on her desk like a particularly menacing sourdough starter.  Outside, the relentless Pacific pounded against the cliffs, a rhythmic reminder of the relentless tide of demands on her time.  Seabrook, with its charming facade of seaside serenity, was currently feeling less like a haven and more like a pressure cooker.
