The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Amy” Hernandez’s hair across her face as she wrestled the heavy back door of the ambulance open.  The rusted hinges groaned a mournful protest, a sound almost swallowed by the insistent wail of sirens echoing from the distant city.

The flickering neon sign of the Rusty Mug tavern across the street cast a sickly yellow glow on the slick, rain-streaked asphalt of Elm Street, illuminating the scene before her – a crumpled figure lying amidst shattered glass and overturned picnic tables.  The air, thick with the smell of stale beer and something metallically sharp, told her this was going to be a long night.  This was the kind of night that tested even the most seasoned EMTs in the gritty, unforgiving underbelly of Providence, Rhode Island.
