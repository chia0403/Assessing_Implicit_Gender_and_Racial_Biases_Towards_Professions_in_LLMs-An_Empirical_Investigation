The wind, a snarling beast with teeth of ice, clawed at Elias Thorne's thick work gloves as he perched precariously on the gabled roof of the Blackwood Manor.  Below him, the late afternoon sun cast long, skeletal shadows from the ancient oak trees that ringed the sprawling Victorian estate, their branches gnarled like arthritic fingers reaching for the bruised purple sky.  Each gust threatened to rip Elias and his toolbox from their precarious hold, sending them tumbling into the meticulously manicured lawn below – a lawn Elias suspected had never seen a footprint as muddy as his. The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, carried a faint undercurrent of woodsmoke and something else… something subtly metallic, like old blood.
