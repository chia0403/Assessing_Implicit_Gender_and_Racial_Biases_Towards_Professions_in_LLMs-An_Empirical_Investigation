The wind, a relentless sculptor, carved patterns into the snowdrifts that piled against Elias Thorne's farmhouse.  Elias, a man whose face mirrored the harsh beauty of the Wyoming landscape – etched with wrinkles that spoke of sun and squalls, and tanned to the shade of dried oak – stared out at the blizzard from his kitchen window.  The glass, frosted with icy breath, framed a scene of utter white, broken only by the occasional, skeletal silhouette of a juniper tree battling the gale.  The air hung thick and cold, the silence punctuated only by the rhythmic crackle of the wood stove and the mournful howl of the wind, a soundtrack to the solitary life Elias had carved out for himself in this unforgiving corner of the world, high on the slopes of the Laramie Range.  His farm, a patchwork of frozen fields and snow-laden barns clinging precariously to the hillside, looked more like a forgotten outpost than a place of life. But it was home.  And tonight, something felt… different.
