The scent of woodsmoke and damp wool hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Elias Thorne, master tailor of Oakhaven.  Rain lashed against the leaded-glass windows of his shop, a rhythmic drumming that competed only with the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of his shears.  Elias, his brow furrowed in concentration, meticulously shaped a sleeve of deep emerald velvet, the rich fabric gleaming under the weak light of a single oil lamp.  Outside, the cobblestones of Oakhaven's High Street glistened, reflecting the blurry glow of distant gas lamps, a stark contrast to the cozy warmth of his cluttered workspace, where bolts of silk, linen, and tweed jostled for space alongside half-finished garments and tools of his trade.  The air, thick with the promise of a long, wet night, held a hint of something else â€“ a tension, a simmering unease that even the comforting rhythm of his work couldn't quite dispel.
