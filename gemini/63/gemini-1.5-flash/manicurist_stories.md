The scent of acetone and lavender hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Aurelia "Reli" Marigold.  Reli, a manicurist with hands as nimble as a hummingbird's and a laugh that could charm the birds from the trees, surveyed her kingdom:  "The Polished Petal," a tiny nail salon tucked away on a cobblestone side street in the heart of Prague's Old Town.  Rain lashed against the stained-glass window, blurring the already hazy gaslight glow of the street outside, painting the scene in muted oranges and bruised purples.  Inside, however, the air buzzed with the low hum of conversation, the gentle whir of the electric file, and the rhythmic click-clack of Reli's own skillful fingers working on a client's intricate floral design.  Tonight, however, the usual gentle chaos felt charged, thick with a premonition as unsettling as the storm brewing overhead.
