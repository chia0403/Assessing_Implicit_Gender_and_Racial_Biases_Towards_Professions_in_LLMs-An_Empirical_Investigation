The chipped paint of the dressing room door, a faded shade of rose, mirrored the exhaustion blooming beneath Seraphina Evangeline Moreau's meticulously applied stage makeup.  The air hung thick with the cloying sweetness of cheap perfume and the metallic tang of fear.  Outside, the roar of the crowd at the Rusty Mug – a legendary dive bar clinging precariously to the edge of the city's crumbling docks – was a low, guttural beast, promising both adulation and oblivion in equal measure.  Seraphina ran a trembling hand over the worn velvet of her microphone stand, the cool material a stark contrast to the frantic beating of her heart. Tonight, everything was on the line. This wasn't just another gig in a string of forgotten back alleys and smoky bars; tonight, she was playing for her life, or at least for a shot at it. The stale air smelled of desperation and cheap beer, the perfect aroma for a singer who had nothing left to lose.
