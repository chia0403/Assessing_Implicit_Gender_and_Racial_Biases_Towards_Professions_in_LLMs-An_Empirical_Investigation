The fluorescent lights of the drafting room hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic scratch of Elias Thorne's pencil on Mylar.  Dust motes, illuminated by the harsh glare, danced in the stagnant air above his cluttered desk, a miniature galaxy swirling around blueprints for a proposed wind farm off the coast of Maine.  Elias, a man whose life seemed as meticulously planned as the grid lines on his current project, meticulously shaded the contours of a turbine blade, the graphite a fine, precise dance across the translucent surface. The air smelled faintly of stale coffee and the slightly acrid scent of developing chemicals from the darkroom down the hall â€“ a scent Elias, after twenty years at Winslow & Croft Architects, had come to associate not with unpleasantness, but with the quiet, predictable rhythm of his working life.  Outside, the October wind howled a different tune entirely, a wild counterpoint to the order he meticulously crafted within the four walls of his office.
