The stale air of the Midtown Manhattan law firm hung heavy with the scent of expensive coffee and simmering resentment.  Fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune above Amelia Hernandez’s head, their glare reflecting harshly off the polished mahogany of her desk.  Amelia, a paralegal with five years of experience and a caffeine addiction that rivaled even the most seasoned litigator's, sighed, the sound swallowed by the low thrum of activity in the open-plan office. Outside, the city roared – a chaotic symphony of car horns, sirens, and the incessant chatter of a million hurried footsteps – but inside, the only audible sound beyond the hum of the lights was the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of her fingers on the keyboard, a counterpoint to the gnawing anxiety churning in her stomach.  Tonight, the looming shadow of the Peterson case hung heavier than usual.  It was a multi-million dollar lawsuit, and Amelia held the key to unlocking its secrets, hidden somewhere within the mountains of disorganized paperwork stacked haphazardly on her desk – a precarious Jenga tower of legal documents threatening to topple at any moment.
