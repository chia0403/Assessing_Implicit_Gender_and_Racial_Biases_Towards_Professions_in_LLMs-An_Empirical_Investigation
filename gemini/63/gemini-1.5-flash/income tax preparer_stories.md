The fluorescent lights of Reginald “Reggie” Fitzwilliam’s cramped office hummed a discordant tune, a soundtrack to the creeping dread that accompanied the final weeks of tax season.  Reggie, a man whose neatly-parted brown hair and meticulously ironed shirts suggested a life far more ordered than the chaotic mountain of paperwork threatening to engulf his desk, sighed. The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee, printer ink, and the faint, underlying aroma of desperation – a scent Reggie knew intimately.  Outside, the March wind howled a mournful melody against the grimy windows of his storefront office on the edge of downtown Belleville, a town whose charm was overshadowed by its persistent economic struggles.  This year felt particularly brutal; the usual anxieties were amplified by the new tax law, a confusing labyrinth of deductions and penalties that had left even Reggie scratching his head.  He rubbed his tired eyes, the harsh glare reflecting off the overflowing in-tray, each file representing another life story, another tale of financial hope and hardship.
