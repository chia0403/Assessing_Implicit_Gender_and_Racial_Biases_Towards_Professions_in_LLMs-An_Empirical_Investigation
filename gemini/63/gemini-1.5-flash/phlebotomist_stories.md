The fluorescent lights of the Mercy General Hospital phlebotomy lab hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* of Amelia Grace Hawthorne's own pulse.  It was a sound she'd become intimately familiar with over the last seven years, a soundtrack to countless veins located, accessed, and sometimes, frustratingly, missed.  The air hung heavy with the antiseptic scent of rubbing alcohol and the faint, metallic tang of blood – a perfume Amelia had, surprisingly, come to tolerate, even appreciate in a peculiar, professional way.  Tonight, however, the usual clinical calm was shattered.  A frantic, whispered conversation echoed from the hallway beyond the swinging doors, punctuated by the sharp, metallic clang of a gurney.  Amelia, usually unflappable, felt a prickle of apprehension crawl up her spine.  This wasn’t just another routine blood draw night.
