The biting Antarctic wind howled like a banshee, tearing at the seams of Dr. Aris Thorne’s thermal parka.  Ice crystals, sharp as shards of glass, stung his exposed skin despite his balaclava.  He hunched deeper into the swirling snow, the rhythmic crunch of his boots the only sound that pierced the deafening roar of the gale.  Above, the perpetual twilight cast a sickly green hue over the desolate, ice-covered landscape of the McMurdo Dry Valleys.  Aris, a glaciologist with the British Antarctic Survey, squinted through the blizzard, his breath misting in the frigid air.  His breath hitched, not from the cold, but from the sight before him – a fissure in the ancient ice, impossibly deep, radiating an unnatural, inner glow.  It pulsed with a faint, rhythmic light, a heartbeat in the frozen heart of the continent. This was no ordinary geological formation.  This was something… else.
