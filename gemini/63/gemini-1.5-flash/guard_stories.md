The biting wind howled a mournful song across the desolate plains of Eryndor, whipping snow into frenzied spirals that stung Gareth Rhys’s cheeks raw.  He hunched deeper into his worn furs, the collar pulled high against the icy blast.  His breath plumed out in white clouds, quickly swallowed by the swirling vortex.  Gareth, a veteran guard of the King’s own elite Raven Guard, stood sentinel at the edge of the Whisperwind Pass, a narrow, treacherous defile that snaked through the jagged peaks towards the forbidden lands beyond. The only sound louder than the wind was the rhythmic crunch of his boots on the frozen ground, a solitary beat in the vast, unforgiving landscape.  The flickering light of his lantern, barely piercing the pre-dawn gloom, cast long, dancing shadows that seemed to writhe and twist like malevolent spirits in the periphery of his vision.  This was no ordinary patrol; tonight, something felt…different.  A primal unease prickled at the back of his neck, a feeling far colder than the icy wind that whipped at his cloak.
