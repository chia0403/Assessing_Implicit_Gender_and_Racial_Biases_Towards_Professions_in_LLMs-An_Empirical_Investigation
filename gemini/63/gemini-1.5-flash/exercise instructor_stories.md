The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of sweat and cheap air freshener, clinging to the peeling paint of the "Fit & Fab" gym like a second skin.  Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the chipped linoleum floor.  This wasn't the gleaming, chrome-and-glass fitness emporium advertised in the glossy brochures; this was Fit & Fab's less glamorous, slightly damp, basement branch.  But for Esmeralda "Esme" Valencia, certified personal trainer and Zumba enthusiast extraordinaire, it was home.  The rhythmic thump-thump-thump of a salsa beat pulsed from the tiny speaker system, a stark contrast to the quiet, almost mournful creak of the aging exercise bikes in the corner. Esme, her vibrant turquoise leggings gleaming under the harsh lights, checked her watch impatiently.  Five minutes until her 6:00 pm Zumba Gold class, and so far, only Agnes and Mrs. Periwinkle were bravely battling the humidity.
