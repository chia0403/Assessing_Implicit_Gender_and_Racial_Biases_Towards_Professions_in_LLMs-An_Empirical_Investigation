The fluorescent lights of the Galleria hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne's meticulously crafted despair.  Amelia, or Amy as most people (mostly clients trying to haggle her down) called her, adjusted the silk scarf draped around her neck, the pale lavender a stark contrast to the stark white of her impeccably tailored suit.

The last hour had yielded precisely zero sales, and the mounting pressure was starting to feel like a physical weight on her chest.  Her quota loomed, a monstrous, glittering beast ready to devour her if she didn't slay it by the end of the week.
