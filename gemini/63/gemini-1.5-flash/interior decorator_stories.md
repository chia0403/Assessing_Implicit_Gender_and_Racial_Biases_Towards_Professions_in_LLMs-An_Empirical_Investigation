The scent of linseed oil and old wood hung heavy in the air, a perfume as familiar to Seraphina "Sera" Moreau as her own breath.  Dust motes, illuminated by the slanting afternoon sun slicing through the grimy warehouse windows, danced in the cavernous space.  Crates overflowed with forgotten treasures â€“ chipped porcelain dolls, tarnished silver picture frames, and velvet-covered chaise longues, their once-opulent fabric now faded and moth-eaten.  This wasn't Sera's usual design studio, nestled in the chic boutiques of the Marais district; this was the forgotten heart of Belleville, a labyrinth of crumbling buildings whispering tales of a bygone era, and today, it was her canvas.  The air thrummed with the low, rhythmic hum of a nearby construction site, a stark counterpoint to the quiet rustle of Sera's silk scarf as she surveyed her latest, and most challenging, project.
