The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Mia” Hernandez’s dark hair across her face as she navigated the crumbling steps of the dilapidated apartment building.  Number 2B, scrawled in faded, chipped paint, was her destination, the final stop on a particularly brutal Tuesday.  The air hung heavy with the scent of stale cigarettes, damp concrete, and something indefinably…off.  This wasn't the picturesque, leafy suburb she'd envisioned when she'd started her career as a probation officer in the city; this was the underbelly, a concrete labyrinth of desperation woven between crumbling brick and shattered dreams.  The flickering streetlight cast long, distorted shadows, making even the familiar feel menacing.  Mia tugged her worn wool coat tighter, the collar scratching at her neck a small discomfort compared to the knot of unease tightening in her stomach.  She was here to see Javier Rodriguez, her most challenging case to date, a young man teetering on the precipice, and Mia wasn't sure she could prevent his fall.
