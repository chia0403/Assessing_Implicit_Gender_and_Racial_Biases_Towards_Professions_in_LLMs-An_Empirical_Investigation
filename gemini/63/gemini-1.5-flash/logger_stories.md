The biting wind howled a mournful song through the skeletal branches of the ancient Douglas firs, a counterpoint to the rhythmic groan of Elias Thorne's chainsaw.  Elias, a man carved from the same granite as the mountains surrounding him, barely registered the chill.  He was lost in the work, the familiar scent of pine and sawdust filling his lungs, a comforting aroma that had been a part of his life since he could walk.  He stood perched precariously on the steep, snow-dusted slope of Mount Arrowsmith, the vast, unforgiving wilderness of British Columbia sprawling before him, a landscape both beautiful and brutal in its untamed glory.  The sky, a bruised purple canvas streaked with angry orange, promised a blizzard before nightfall.  The only sound louder than the chainsaw was the insistent drumming of Elias's own heart, a rhythm as steady and reliable as the fall of the ancient trees.
