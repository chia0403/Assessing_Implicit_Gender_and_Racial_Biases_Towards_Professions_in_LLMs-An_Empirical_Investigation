The scent of lavender and sandalwood hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the chill November wind rattling the windowpanes of Serenity Spa.  Rain lashed against the leaded glass, a steady, rhythmic drumming that almost drowned out the low hum of the ambient music.  Inside, however, a quiet intensity reigned.  Eleanor Vance, a massage therapist with hands as nimble as a hummingbirdâ€™s wings and a gaze that could soothe a wounded soul, meticulously prepared for her last appointment of the day.  Her workspace, a haven of calm nestled between two other treatment rooms, was bathed in the soft glow of a Himalayan salt lamp, its warm orange light reflecting in the polished wooden surfaces.  The only sounds were the gentle whirring of the air purifier and the occasional creak of the ancient floorboards beneath her feet.  Tonight, however, the usual tranquility was laced with a subtle unease.  Eleanor felt it in the pit of her stomach, a prickling sensation that had nothing to do with the lingering chill of the autumn evening.
