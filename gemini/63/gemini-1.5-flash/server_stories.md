The flickering neon sign outside cast long, distorted shadows across the worn linoleum floor, highlighting the dust motes dancing in the single shaft of light that pierced the gloom. Tonight, even the usual Friday night bustle felt subdued, a hesitant tremor rather than a lively hum.  Amelia, a twenty-four-year-old with eyes the color of a stormy sea and a smile that could charm a crab out of its shell, knew this quiet meant trouble.  The kind of trouble that usually came in the form of unpaid tabs and increasingly demanding customers.
