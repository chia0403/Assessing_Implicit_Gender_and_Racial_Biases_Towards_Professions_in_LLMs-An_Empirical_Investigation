The biting wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vance’s auburn braid across her face as she wrestled the heavy oak door of the Alder Creek Veterinary Clinic open.  The scent of antiseptic and pine – a peculiar blend unique to the isolated mountain town – hit her with the force of a physical blow.  Snow, thick and unforgiving, piled high against the weathered clapboard siding, obscuring everything beyond the porch except for the skeletal branches of a lone, snow-laden spruce.  Inside, the clinic was a haven of warmth, the air thick with the comforting aroma of simmering chamomile tea and the faint, almost metallic, tang of iodine.  A crackling fire in the hearth cast dancing shadows on the worn, linoleum floor, momentarily chasing away the bleakness of the winter landscape outside.  Eleanor shivered, shaking off the lingering chill, and headed for the familiar warmth of the examination room, the rhythmic *tick-tock* of the grandfather clock in the hallway a steady counterpoint to the howling wind.
