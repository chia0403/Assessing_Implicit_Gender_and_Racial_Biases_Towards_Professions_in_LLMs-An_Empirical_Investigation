The chipped Formica countertop felt cool beneath Elias Thorne's fingertips as he polished a glass, the rhythmic swirl a counterpoint to the low hum of conversation and the clinking of ice.  Rain lashed against the windows of "The Rusty Mug," blurring the neon glow of the city streetlights into hazy halos.

The Mug, nestled on a forgotten corner of Bleecker Street in a forgotten part of Greenwich Village, was a haven for the lost, the lonely, and the perpetually underestimated, a place where secrets spilled easier than the cheap bourbon. Tonight, however, felt different.  Even the usual cacophony felt muted, replaced by an unsettling quiet that prickled at the back of Elias's neck, a silence pregnant with something unseen, something… waiting.
