The stale scent of dust and forgotten dreams clung to the air in the dilapidated theatre, a perfume only Esmelia "Esme" Blackwood truly appreciated.  Crimson velvet, once plush, now frayed and moth-eaten, draped the empty proscenium arch, a skeletal grin against the peeling plaster walls.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of sunlight slicing through a grimy window, illuminating the scattered debris: a discarded wig, a half-eaten sandwich petrified to the floorboards, and a single, iridescent feather, possibly a relic from a long-dead peacock.  This was the Grand Majestic Theatre, or what remained of it â€“ Esme's latest, and possibly her most ambitious, project.  The air crackled not only with the dust, but with the ghosts of countless performances past, and the silent promise of a theatrical resurrection yet to come.
