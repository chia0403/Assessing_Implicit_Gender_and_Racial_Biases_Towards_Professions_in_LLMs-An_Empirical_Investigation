The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful song around Captain Evelyn "Evie" Reed's battered Cessna 185, its icy breath frosting the already-fogged cockpit windows.  Below, the Chugach Mountains clawed at the bruised, twilight sky, their jagged peaks shrouded in a swirling, ethereal mist that swallowed the valleys whole.  The only sound louder than the wind was the rhythmic thrum of the engine, a reassuring heartbeat against the vast, unforgiving wilderness. Evie gripped the yoke, her knuckles white against the worn leather, her gaze fixed on the barely-visible outline of the glacier ahead â€“ her destination, and possibly her only hope. The radio crackled with static, a mocking whisper in the deafening silence of the Alaskan expanse.  This wasn't just another flight; it was a fight for survival.
