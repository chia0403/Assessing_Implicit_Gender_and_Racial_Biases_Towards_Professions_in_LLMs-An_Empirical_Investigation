Rain lashed against the Art Deco windows of the Chrysler Building, blurring the already fading twilight into a hazy grey.  Inside, on the fifty-first floor, the opulent office of Reginald Grimshaw, CEO of Grimshaw & Sons Import-Export, was a haven of warmth and quiet. Eleanor Vance, her full name rarely uttered in the hurried rhythm of the office, sat at her mahogany desk, the rhythmic tapping of her fingers on the keyboard the only sound besides the muted roar of the storm outside.  The emerald green lamp cast a soft glow on her neatly organized workspace, highlighting the precise stacks of files and the single white orchid perched delicately in a crystal vase.  She was impeccably dressed in a charcoal grey suit, her auburn hair pulled back in a sleek chignon, a stark contrast to the chaos brewing just outside her door.  Eleanor had a premonition, a prickle of unease that had settled in her stomach hours ago and refused to budge. It wasn't the storm; she was used to those. This was something else, something connected to the mysterious package that had arrived earlier that day, a package addressed simply to "R. Grimshaw" with no return address and a distinctly foreign stamp.
