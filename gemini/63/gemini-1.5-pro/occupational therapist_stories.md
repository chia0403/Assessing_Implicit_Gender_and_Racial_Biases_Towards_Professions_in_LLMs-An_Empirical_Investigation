The biting wind whipped off Lake Superior, stinging Amelia Hayes’s cheeks as she navigated the icy path to the Peterson farmhouse.  November in northern Minnesota had a way of stripping the world bare, leaving only skeletal trees and the steely grey expanse of the lake.  The farmhouse, a two-story structure weathered grey like driftwood, hunched against the gale, smoke curling reluctantly from its chimney.  Amelia, her breath puffing out in white clouds, clutched her oversized tote bag, the contents – therapeutic putty, resistance bands, and a finely crafted wooden puzzle – clinking softly with each step.  She was here to see Elias Peterson, a stoic, seventy-year-old farmer who’d suffered a stroke two months prior, leaving his left hand clumsy and unresponsive. The landscape mirrored his current state: stark, unforgiving, and seemingly frozen in time.  Amelia hoped, with a flicker of optimism warming her against the cold, that she could help thaw some of that frozen ground.
