The biting November wind whipped Elias Thorne's threadbare cap across the manicured lawns of Eventide Manor, chasing it towards the skeletal branches of the ancient oak that dominated the eastern edge of the property.  Elias sighed, a puff of white against the grey sky, and trudged after it. Eventide, with its gothic turrets and ivy-choked facade, loomed over him, a brooding presence against the backdrop of the churning North Sea. The salty spray, carried on the relentless wind, stung his face and coated the already-damp grass with a fine, glistening mist.  He retrieved his cap, tucking a stray strand of greying brown hair back under its brim, and surveyed his domain.  Twenty acres of meticulously maintained gardens, his responsibility and his refuge, lay spread before him, a patchwork of muted autumnal colours punctuated by the dark green of the evergreens.  But this morning, something felt different.  A disquiet hung in the air, heavier than the sea mist, colder than the November wind.
