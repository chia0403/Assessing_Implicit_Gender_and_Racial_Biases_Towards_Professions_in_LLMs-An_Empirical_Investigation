The clatter of horse-drawn carriages on cobblestones was a constant lullaby in the SoHo district of London, a rhythm that vibrated through the floorboards and up into the cramped workroom of Eliza Rose Hawthorne.  It was 1888, a year draped in the suffocating grey of a perpetual London fog, and gaslight flickered across Eliza’s nimble fingers as they manipulated a length of emerald green silk.  Her workroom, tucked away above a bustling bakery on Greek Street, was a sanctuary of colour and texture. Bolts of velvet, satin, and lace were stacked precariously against the walls, their vibrant hues a stark contrast to the monochrome world outside.  Pins and needles glinted like tiny jewels scattered across the worn wooden worktable, where half-finished gowns lay draped like sleeping beauties, awaiting Eliza’s transformative touch.  Tonight, however, the usual comforting chaos of her creative space held an unusual tension.  The air was thick, not just with the scent of fabric and beeswax, but with anticipation.  A single crimson rose, delivered just an hour earlier, lay on her worktable, its petals unfurling like a whispered promise of something momentous.
