The rusty scissors, affectionately nicknamed "Snippy" by Esmeralda "Esme" Rodriguez, snicked rhythmically, punctuated by the soft hiss of hairspray. The air in "Shear Radiance," Esme's tiny salon, hung thick with the mingled scents of coconut shampoo, lavender detangler, and the faint, metallic tang of perm solution.  Nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed fortune teller's parlor on the faded end of Magnolia Street in New Orleans, the salon wasn't much to look at from the outside.  Peeling paint, a flickering neon sign, and a perpetually crooked potted fern by the door gave it a slightly dilapidated charm. But inside, amidst the vibrant wall murals depicting fantastical hairstyles and framed photographs of satisfied customers, Esme reigned supreme, wielding her scissors like a magic wand and dispensing wisdom and gossip in equal measure.  The afternoon sun, slanting through the dusty windows, cast long shadows across the checkered linoleum floor as Mrs. Dubois, her poodle perched nervously in her lap, recounted the latest drama unfolding in her apartment building.  The bell above the door chimed, signaling a new arrival, and Esme, mid-sentence about the outrageous price of okra these days, looked up with a welcoming smile.
