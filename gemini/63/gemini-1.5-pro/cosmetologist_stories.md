Rain lashed against the glass, mirroring the nervous flutter in Wednesday’s stomach.  This wasn’t just any dye job. This was a transformation, a rebellion, and Wednesday, with her steady hand and artistic eye, was the catalyst. She knew this particular shade of green would be the talk of the town, and for Wednesday, that was precisely the point.
