The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, rattling the corrugated iron roof of the Shetland Islands Broadcasting station and making the guy wires sing a mournful tune.  Inside, nestled amidst a tangle of vacuum tubes, wires, and resistors, Elias "Eli" Vance tightened the last connection on a newly installed transmitter, a faint scent of solder still hanging in the air.  Lerwick, the largest town on the archipelago, blinked below like a scattering of Christmas lights against the bruised purple of the approaching twilight.  It was late December, 1957, and a blizzard was brewing.  The only sounds besides the wind were the rhythmic clicking of the morse code receiver in the corner and the low hum of the generator churning faithfully in the adjacent room.  Eli, his brow furrowed in concentration, double-checked the dial settings, his calloused fingers leaving faint greasy smudges on the bakelite knobs.  Tonight was the annual Christmas Eve broadcast, a tradition cherished by the isolated islanders, and Eli, as the sole technician, carried the weight of its success entirely on his shoulders.  He couldn't afford any glitches, not tonight.
