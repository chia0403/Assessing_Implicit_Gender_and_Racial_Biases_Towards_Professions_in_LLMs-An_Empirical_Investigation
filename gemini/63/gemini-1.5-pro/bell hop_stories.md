The revolving doors of the Grand Majestic Hotel sighed open, exhaling a gust of frigid Chicago air that ruffled the perfectly coiffed hair of Mrs. Vandergelt the Third.  Bartholomew "Barty" Higgins, his pillbox hat perched precariously on his head,  braced himself. This was it.  The Christmas rush. A tide of fur coats, diamond tiaras, and demanding whispers were about to engulf the lobby, and Barty, in his crisp navy uniform with brass buttons gleaming under the crystal chandeliers, was their first line of defence. The Grand Majestic, a monolith of marble and gilt, loomed over Michigan Avenue, its windows glowing warmly against the December gloom.  Built in 1928, it breathed an air of old-world elegance, a stark contrast to the bustling, modern city outside.  Inside, the air thrummed with a unique energy â€“ a cocktail of anticipation, wealth, and the faint scent of pine needles emanating from the twenty-foot Christmas tree that dominated the centre of the grand foyer.  For Barty, however,  Christmas Eve at the Majestic wasn't about twinkling lights and festive cheer. It was about survival.
