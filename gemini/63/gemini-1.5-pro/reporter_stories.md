The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Thorne's auburn hair across her face as she huddled deeper into her threadbare coat.  Rust-colored leaves, crisp underfoot, swirled around her ankles like confetti celebrating the demise of autumn.  She stood on the cracked asphalt of Sycamore Street, the only soul brave – or foolish – enough to be out in the pre-dawn chill in the desolate town of Havenwood, Pennsylvania.  A single streetlamp, its bulb flickering weakly, cast long, skeletal shadows that danced with the swirling leaves, lending the already dilapidated storefronts an even more sinister air. Havenwood, once a bustling coal mining town, was now a husk of its former self, a place where hope had packed its bags and boarded the last train out years ago.  Amy, notepad clutched in her gloved hand, her breath misting in the frigid air, had come to Havenwood chasing a story, a ghost story, some said. The story of the Ravenwood Mine disaster and the whispers that followed – whispers of something more than just a cave-in.
