The relentless Michigan winter had finally released its icy grip on Ann Arbor, leaving behind a damp, earthy scent that clung to everything.  Magnolia trees, still bare of their creamy blossoms, dripped with melting snow, and the Huron River, freed from its frozen shackles, gurgled with renewed vigor.  Inside the warmly lit, pastel-hued office of "Smile Design by Dr. Albright,"  Amelia Rose Hawthorne, RDH, polished a set of stainless steel dental instruments, the rhythmic clinking a counterpoint to the gentle whirring of the autoclave.  It was a Tuesday morning, precisely 7:52 AM, and Amelia, always punctual, was preparing for her first patient, a nervous teenager scheduled for a routine cleaning.  A faint scent of cinnamon hung in the air, courtesy of the pot brewing in the breakroom, and though the day promised to be busy, Amelia felt a sense of calm settle over her as she surveyed her meticulously organized operatory.  She was good at her job, enjoyed helping people, and the familiar routine was a comfort in a world that often felt anything but predictable.
