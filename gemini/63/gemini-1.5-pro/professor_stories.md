The biting November wind whipped around Professor Alistair Finch, tugging at the edges of his tweed overcoat as he hurried across the cobbled quadrangle of St. Jude's College, Oxford. Gargoyles leered down from the honey-coloured stone of the medieval buildings, their grotesque faces slick with rain.  The gas lamps, recently lit against the encroaching dusk, cast flickering pools of orange light, barely penetrating the thick fog that was beginning to roll in from the Isis. Alistair clutched a worn leather satchel overflowing with student essays, the weight a familiar comfort against his side.  He was late for the weekly meeting of the Bibliophiles Society, a gathering he cherished for its arcane discussions and the quiet camaraderie of fellow academics. Tonight's topic – the possible existence of a lost manuscript detailing John Dee's alchemical experiments – promised to be particularly intriguing, and Alistair, a scholar of Renaissance esotericism, was eager to contribute.  However, a nagging unease prickled at the edges of his anticipation, a sense that something was amiss, a feeling as cold and clinging as the fog itself.
