The bell above the door of "Petal & Stem" tinkled, a fragile counterpoint to the rumble of a passing garbage truck.  Rain lashed against the large front window, blurring the vibrant colours of the tulips and hyacinths displayed there. Inside, Eliza Jane Hawthorne, her auburn braid draped over one shoulder, hummed along to a scratchy Billie Holiday record as she expertly wired the stem of a delicate blush-coloured rose. The small shop, nestled between a laundromat and a dimly lit pawnbroker on Bleecker Street, was a riot of fragrant chaos. Buckets overflowing with blooms lined the walls, their scents mingling with the earthy aroma of damp potting soil and the sweet perfume of Eliza's signature rosewater spray.  It was a grey Tuesday morning in late November, and while the rest of Greenwich Village braced itself for the impending Thanksgiving rush, Petal & Stem held a quiet, almost sacred air, a sanctuary from the bustling city outside.
