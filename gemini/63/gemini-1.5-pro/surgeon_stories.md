The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne as he hurried across the cobbled courtyard of St. Jude's Hospital, the ancient stone radiating a chill that seeped through his thick wool overcoat.  Gargoyles perched on the eaves, their granite faces grimacing down at him, seeming to mirror the knot of anxiety tightening in his stomach.  St. Jude's, nestled in the heart of Edinburgh's Old Town, had stood for centuries, its walls steeped in history, both medical and macabre.  Tonight, the air felt particularly heavy, the usual comforting scent of antiseptic replaced by something Elias couldn't quite place â€“ something metallic and faintly sweet. He pushed open the heavy oak doors, the brass nameplate gleaming under the dim gaslight: "Elias Thorne, MD, FRCS."  Inside, the hushed expectancy of a waiting room held its breath, and Elias knew, with a certainty that chilled him more than the November wind, that tonight would be different.
