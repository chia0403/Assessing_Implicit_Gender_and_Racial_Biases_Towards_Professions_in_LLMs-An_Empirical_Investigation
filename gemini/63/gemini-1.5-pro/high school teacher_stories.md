St. Agatha's, a bastion of old money and older traditions nestled in the sleepy, affluent town, seemed impervious to the changing seasons, its ivy-covered stone walls whispering stories of generations past.  This morning, however, a different kind of chill hung in the air, a premonition of something unsettling that went beyond the mere dip in temperature.  Elias had felt it since arriving, a subtle dissonance in the familiar rhythm of the school day, like a skipped beat in a well-rehearsed melody.
