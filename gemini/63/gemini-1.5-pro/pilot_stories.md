The biting wind whipped at Amelia “Mia” Rodriguez’s flight suit as she prepped her Cessna 172 Skyhawk for takeoff.  The Alaskan sun, a pale ghost in the pre-dawn sky, cast long shadows across the frozen expanse of Lake Hood, the world's busiest seaplane base.  Ice crystals glittered on the wings like a dusting of diamonds, a deceptive beauty hiding the treacherous conditions.  Mia exhaled, a puff of white momentarily obscuring her view of the Denali range, its jagged peaks looming in the distance like the teeth of a slumbering giant. This morning’s flight was a routine cargo run to a remote mining outpost nestled deep in the Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve, but routine in Alaska often translated to unpredictable and potentially perilous. The air crackled with static, a familiar soundtrack to her solitary flights, mirroring the nervous energy thrumming beneath Mia’s calm exterior.  She had a feeling this wasn't going to be just another milk run.
