The rusty squeak of the screen door announced the arrival of the day's first customer, just as Elias Thorne was finishing polishing the chrome of his barber chair.  Elias, a man whose own salt-and-pepper beard was as precisely sculpted as a topiary bush, surveyed his domain: Thorne's Tonsorial Parlour. Situated on the dusty corner of Oak and Elm in the perpetually sleepy town of Harmony Creek, Oregon, the parlour was a small, wood-panelled haven from the relentless summer heat shimmering off the asphalt outside.  A faint scent of bay rum mingled with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee, a ritual Elias never missed.  The faded sign hanging above the door, depicting a pair of gleaming scissors crossed over a straight razor, hinted at a bygone era, an era Elias stubbornly clung to in the face of modern trends. The rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner added to the timeless, almost hypnotic atmosphere. The newcomer, silhouetted against the bright morning sun, paused in the doorway, dust motes dancing around him like tiny fireflies.
