The biting November wind whipped around Eleanor Vance, plastering strands of her auburn hair across her face. She tugged her charcoal grey scarf tighter, the wool scratching against her cheek as she surveyed the site.  A skeletal frame of steel beams clawed at the bruised London sky, a stark contrast to the elegant Georgian townhouses that lined the adjacent street.  This was Fitzrovia, a place where old world charm wrestled with modern ambition, a battle mirrored within Eleanor herself.  Here, nestled amongst the ghosts of literary giants and bohemian spirits, she was tasked with designing a structure that would both honour the past and embrace the future.  The Fitzrovia Arts Centre, her most ambitious project to date, was still months from completion, but even in its nascent form, Eleanor could feel the weight of expectation pressing down on her. The rhythmic clang of metal on metal echoed around the site, a soundtrack to her silent contemplation. This wasn't just a building; it was a statement, a testament to her vision, and the pressure to get it right was immense.
