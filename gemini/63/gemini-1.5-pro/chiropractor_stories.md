The rusty weathervane atop the old Victorian creaked in protest as a gust of wind rattled the windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's chiropractic clinic.  Rain lashed against the glass, blurring the view of the deserted main street of Havenwood, Oregon.  The town, nestled deep in the Willamette Valley, was usually picturesque with its rows of quaint shops and towering Douglas firs, but tonight, it felt cloaked in an almost palpable unease. Inside, the only sounds were the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock in the waiting room and the muted crackling of the fireplace in Elias's office. He sat hunched over a stack of patient files, the warm glow of the fire reflecting in his wire-rimmed glasses, a frown etched deep between his eyebrows. He'd been in Havenwood for five years, slowly building his practice and trying to outrun the shadows of his past. Tonight, however, those shadows felt closer than ever.  The bell above the door chimed, a discordant clang in the otherwise silent night, and Elias looked up, a sense of foreboding tightening in his chest.
