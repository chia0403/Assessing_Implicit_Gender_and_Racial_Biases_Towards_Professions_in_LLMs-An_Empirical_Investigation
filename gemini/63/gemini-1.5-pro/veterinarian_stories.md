The biting wind whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne as he wrestled the heavy oak door of his clinic closed against the gale.  Snow, driven almost horizontally by the relentless prairie wind, stung his face and piled against the weathered clapboard siding.  The Prairie Winds Veterinary Clinic, nestled between a feed store and a perpetually closed gas station on the outskirts of Harmony, Nebraska, looked desolate and forlorn under the oppressive grey sky.  Inside, a single flickering fluorescent light cast long, skeletal shadows across the worn linoleum floor. The only sounds were the mournful howl of the wind and the occasional clink of surgical instruments hanging from the stainless-steel examination table.  Elias stamped the snow from his boots, a sigh escaping his chapped lips.  It was going to be a long, lonely night.
