The flickering fluorescent lights of the Zenith Laboratories sub-basement hummed a lonely B flat, a counterpoint to the rhythmic squeak of Ezekiel "Zeke" Holloway's mop bucket wheels.  Zeke, a man whose age was etched deeper into his face than the Grand Canyon into Arizona, pushed the bucket down the sterile white hallway. It was 3:17 am, the quietest hour in the building, a time when even the genetically modified mice in the labs above seemed to hold their breath. Zenith Labs, a sprawling complex nestled in the heart of Silicon Valley, prided itself on cutting-edge bio-engineering, a field Zeke understood about as well as he understood quantum physics. His world consisted of waxed floors, overflowing trash cans, and the faint, ever-present scent of disinfectant. Tonight, however, something was different.  A faint, rhythmic pulsing emanated from behind the heavy steel door at the end of the hall, a door marked simply with a biohazard symbol and the number 42.  A door Zeke had been explicitly told never to approach.
