The flickering fluorescent lights of St. Jude's Hospital Emergency Room buzzed like trapped insects, casting a sickly yellow glow over the controlled chaos.  It was 2:17 am, a time when the city outside slept, but the ER pulsed with a life of its own.

Tonight, the waiting room overflowed, a grim tapestry of sniffles, moans, and the vacant stares of exhaustion.  Eleanor, her dark hair pulled back in a tight bun, adjusted the stethoscope around her neck and took a deep breath, steeling herself for whatever the night might bring.  Rain lashed against the windows, mirroring the turbulent emotions swirling within her.  This wasn't just another shift; tonight, Eleanor knew, something felt different.
