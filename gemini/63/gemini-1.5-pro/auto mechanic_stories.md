The rusty aroma of brake dust and engine oil clung to the air like a second skin in the Quonset hut that served as Rosie "Rosebud" Callahan's garage.  Grease stains patterned the concrete floor like abstract art, reflecting the weak winter sun filtering through the grimy skylights. Outside, the wind howled across the desolate expanse of the Mojave Desert, rattling the corrugated iron walls and whipping sand against the lone gas pump that stood sentinel at the edge of the highway. Rosebud, her hands calloused and blackened, tightened the last bolt on a battered '67 Mustang's engine, the wrench clinking in the echoing silence.  Highway 117, a ribbon of cracked asphalt stretching towards the hazy horizon, offered little promise of customers on a day like this. But Rosebud wasn't worried. She had a feeling something – or someone – interesting was about to roll in.
