The bell above the door of Apothecary & Anise jingled merrily, a counterpoint to the low growl of thunder rumbling in the distance. Rain, the kind that promised to settle in for the night, lashed against the large, arched window, blurring the gaslit glow of downtown Hollow Creek.  Inside,  Eleanor Vance, Pharm.D.,  tapped a precise rhythm on her antique apothecary scale with one hand while the other held a delicate silver scoop filled with dried valerian root.  The scent, earthy and slightly sweet, mingled with the sharper notes of eucalyptus and peppermint that perpetually hung in the air of her shop.  Hollow Creek, nestled deep in the Appalachian Mountains, was a town that relied on its remedies – both modern and ancient – and Eleanor was the keeper of both.  Tonight, however, the usual evening rush of townsfolk seeking relief for aches, pains, and restless sleep was conspicuously absent.  The only other presence in the shop was a fat orange tabby cat named Clementine, curled asleep on a stack of vintage medical journals, blissfully unaware of the storm brewing both outside and, Eleanor suspected, within the town itself.
