The aroma of coconut oil and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume that clung to Beatrice "Bea" Flores like a second skin.  Her salon, "Snip & Sass," nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed fortune teller's parlor on Bleecker Street, was a vibrant splash of teal and fuchsia in the otherwise grey landscape of Greenwich Village. Rain lashed against the large front window, blurring the neon "Open" sign and painting streaks across the reflection of Bea's worried face.  It was a Tuesday afternoon in late October, the kind of day that usually brought a steady trickle of regulars needing a trim or a touch-up.  But today, the salon was eerily silent, save for the rhythmic tick-tock of the vintage Coca-Cola clock above the reception desk and the restless drumming of Bea's manicured fingernails on the countertop.  She had a bad feeling, a knot tightening in her stomach that had nothing to do with the lukewarm bodega coffee sheâ€™d gulped down earlier. Something was off.
