The salt spray kissed Aurelia "Rory" Vance's face as she wrestled a canvas onto the easel.  The wind, a boisterous artist itself, whipped her auburn braid across her cheek, momentarily obscuring the view of the churning grey Atlantic. Her studio, a repurposed lobster shack perched precariously on the granite cliffs of Monhegan Island, Maine, creaked and groaned in protest against the approaching storm.  The scent of brine mingled with the sharp tang of turpentine and the faint, sweet perfume of the wildflowers clinging to the cliff face. Inside, paintbrushes bristled in chipped mugs and tubes of vibrant color lay scattered across a worn wooden table, a testament to Roryâ€™s frenetic energy.  This tiny, isolated island, ten miles from the mainland, was her sanctuary, her muse, her prison, and the only place she could truly breathe.
