The biting wind whipped Amelia “Amy” Hawthorne’s auburn braid across her face as she trudged through the knee-deep snow towards the primate enclosure. Dawn painted the sky in bruised purples and hesitant pinks over the sprawling expanse of the Aspen Valley Primate Sanctuary.  Nestled high in the Colorado Rockies, the sanctuary was a haven for rescued primates, a collection of misfits and refugees from labs, circuses, and private owners who’d underestimated the commitment involved in caring for highly intelligent, often volatile, animals. The air, thin and crisp, carried the sharp tang of pine and the faint, musky scent that always clung to the enclosure, a mixture of monkey chow, hay, and something undeniably wild.  The shriek of a macaque echoed through the still morning, followed by the resonant thump of a gorilla's chest beating against the wooden wall of its night house. Amy pulled her thick fleece tighter around her and quickened her pace. Today was census day, which meant every single one of the sanctuary's seventy-two primates needed to be accounted for, and with the fresh snowfall covering everything, it promised to be a long and challenging task.
