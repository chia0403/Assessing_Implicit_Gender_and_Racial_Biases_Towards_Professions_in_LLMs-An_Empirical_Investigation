The biting wind whipped at Elias Thorne's weathered face, stinging his eyes as he surveyed the frost-kissed expanse of Thornefield Farm.  Dawn painted the eastern sky in hues of bruised plum and icy blue, promising another day of frigid toil.  Nestled in the shadow of the brooding, snow-capped peaks of the Whisperwind Mountains, the farm, a patchwork of fields and orchards, clung to the fertile valley like a tenacious weed.  A thin layer of ice crunched under Elias's heavy boots as he walked, the only sound louder than the mournful sigh of the wind through the bare branches of the apple trees. The air smelled of woodsmoke and the damp earth, a scent that usually brought comfort, but this morning held a chilling premonition, a sense of unease that settled deep in Eliasâ€™s gut.  The harvest had been poor this year, and the looming winter threatened more than just cold; it threatened the very survival of his family and their farm.
