The clatter of pots and pans was Eleanor Ainsworth's morning symphony. Not the delicate tinkling of a triangle, mind you, but the full-throated roar of a brass section â€“ a dented stockpot lid cymbal crashing against a warped frying pan.  The air in the tiny kitchen, tucked away at the back of The Salty Siren, a seaside diner clinging to the cliffs of Osprey Point, hung thick with the aroma of frying bacon and brewing coffee. Outside, the fog, a regular visitor in the early hours, clung to the ragged coastline, shrouding the rocky beach and the restless grey expanse of the North Sea beyond.  Eleanor, with flour dusting her apron and a smudge of grease on her cheek, hummed along to a scratchy radio broadcast, already anticipating the rush of fishermen and early-bird tourists that would soon flood the diner, seeking refuge from the damp chill and craving the warmth of her legendary clam chowder.
