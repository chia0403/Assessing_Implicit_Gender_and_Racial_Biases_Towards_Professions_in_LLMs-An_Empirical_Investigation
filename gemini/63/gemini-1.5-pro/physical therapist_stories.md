The biting wind whipped off Lake Superior, rattling the frosted panes of the Superior Physical Therapy clinic and stinging Dr. Elias Vance's cheeks as he hurried across the parking lot.  The November dusk had settled early, painting the sky in bruised purples and gunmetal greys.  Snow, the kind that crunched satisfyingly underfoot, blanketed everything in a pristine layer, muffling the usual sounds of the small Minnesota town of Lutsen. Inside, the clinic was a haven of warmth and quiet, lit by the soft glow of salt lamps and the gentle hum of the ultrasound machine.  Elias stamped the snow off his boots, a sigh escaping him as the scent of pine disinfectant and peppermint tea filled his lungs.  This was his sanctuary, his space to mend broken bodies and, sometimes, broken spirits.  Tonight, however, a different kind of chill lingered in the air, one that had nothing to do with the plummeting temperature outside.
