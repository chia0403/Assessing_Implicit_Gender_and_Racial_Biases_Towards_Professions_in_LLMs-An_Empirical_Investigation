The salt spray kissed Amelia "Milly" Reyes's face as she leaned against the railing of the *Mermaid's Whisper*, a rickety but charming ferryboat chugging its way towards Isla Mujeres. The turquoise waters of the Caribbean Sea shimmered under the relentless Mexican sun, a stark contrast to the brooding grey skies Milly had left behind in Seattle just two days prior. Isla Mujeres, a small island just eight miles off the coast of Cancun, was a world away from the drizzle and evergreen forests of her Pacific Northwest home.  Here, the air vibrated with the buzz of cicadas, the scent of hibiscus and salty air, and the promise of hidden cenotes and ancient Mayan ruins. Today, Milly had a group of twenty eager tourists to shepherd through the island's treasures, a task she usually relished. But a nagging feeling, a premonition almost, tugged at the edges of her usual sunny disposition.  Something felt different about this tour, about this island, today.
