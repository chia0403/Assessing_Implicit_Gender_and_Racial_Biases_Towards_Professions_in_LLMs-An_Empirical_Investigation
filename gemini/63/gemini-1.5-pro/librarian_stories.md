Outside, the bustling metropolis of New London, Connecticut hummed with the rhythm of modern life, but within the thick stone walls of the Athenaeum, time seemed to hold its breath, whispering secrets only Amelia could hear. This particular afternoon, however, the whispers held a different tone – a chilling premonition that something within the library’s tranquil heart was about to change.
