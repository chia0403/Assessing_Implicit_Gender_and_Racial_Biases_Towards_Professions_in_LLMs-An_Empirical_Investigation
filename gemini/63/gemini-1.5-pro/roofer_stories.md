The sun, a malevolent eye in the bruised-purple sky, beat down on Elias Finch's back. Sweat trickled down his temples, stinging his eyes as he secured another shingle on the steeply pitched roof of the old Victorian mansion.  Below him, the town of Havenwood, Pennsylvania, stretched out like a crumpled green carpet, punctuated by the silver ribbon of the Susquehanna River.  It was a postcard-perfect scene, but Elias barely noticed. His focus was entirely on the task at hand, the rhythmic hammering a steady counterpoint to the buzzing of cicadas in the heavy, humid air. This old house, with its peeling paint and overgrown ivy, was his current battlefield, and gravity was the enemy.  Heâ€™d been at it since dawn, and the late July heat was radiating up from the slate tiles, baking him alive. He knew that the promised thunderstorm would break soon, bringing with it a welcome respite, but until then, it was just him, the scorching sun, and the endless expanse of roof.
