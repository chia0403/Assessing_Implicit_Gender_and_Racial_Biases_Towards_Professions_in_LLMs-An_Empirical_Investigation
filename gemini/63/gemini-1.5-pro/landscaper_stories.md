The biting October wind whipped Amelia “Milly” Reyes’s braid against her cheek as she surveyed the skeletal remains of Mrs. Hawthorne's prize-winning rose bushes.  Frost had come early to Hollow Creek, Oregon, this year, leaving a brittle, silver kiss on everything it touched. Milly pulled her worn leather gloves tighter, the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves thick in the air. Hollow Creek wasn’t much – a smattering of Victorian houses clinging to the foothills of the Cascades, a general store that doubled as the post office, and a perpetually overcast sky – but it was home. And home, for Milly, meant the satisfying ache in her muscles after a long day wrestling with nature, coaxing life from the soil, and shaping the wild beauty of the Pacific Northwest into ordered tranquility.  Mrs. Hawthorne's garden, usually a riot of color even in late autumn, was this year's biggest challenge. Milly, however, never backed down from a challenge.
