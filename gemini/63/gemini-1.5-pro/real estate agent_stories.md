The salt spray kissed Amelia "Amy" Reyes's face as she wrestled a "SOLD" sign onto its post, the wind whipping her dark hair across her eyes. Below her, the turquoise waters of the Gulf of Mexico lapped against the sugar-white sands of Clearwater Beach, Florida.  This beachfront condo, with its panoramic views and private balcony, had been a tough sell, the previous owner's eccentric decorating choices a major hurdle. But Amy, ever the resourceful agent, had staged the space with borrowed furniture and strategically placed seashells, transforming it into a breezy coastal haven.  Now, with the ink dry on the contract and the keys handed over to a beaming young couple, she allowed herself a satisfied sigh.  The salty air, usually invigorating, carried a hint of unease this afternoon, a premonition that the calm wouldn't last. Amy couldn't shake the feeling that something, somewhere, was about to shift in the sands.
