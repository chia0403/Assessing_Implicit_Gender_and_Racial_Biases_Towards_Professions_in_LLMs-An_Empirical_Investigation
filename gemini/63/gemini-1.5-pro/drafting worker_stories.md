The flickering fluorescent lights of the Titan Engineering drafting room hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Reyes’ life.  It was a Tuesday, indistinguishable from any other Tuesday, in the sprawling industrial complex that clung to the edge of Lake Erie like a barnacle on a ship’s hull.  Outside, the November wind howled, rattling the single-pane windows and spitting icy rain against the glass.  Inside, the air was thick with the smell of stale coffee, pencil shavings, and the faint metallic tang of the machine shop a floor below. Amelia, hunched over her drafting table, meticulously inked the final lines of a blueprint for a new turbine blade.  Her brow furrowed in concentration, a stray curl of dark hair escaping her bun to dance across her cheek.  The room, a vast, open space populated by rows of identical tables, was almost deserted.  Most of the other drafters had already left for the day, leaving Amelia in the quiet company of her T-square and the rhythmic scratching of her pen.  The clock on the wall ticked relentlessly towards 6 pm, a promise of freedom from the precise world of angles and dimensions.  But even as she prepared to pack up, a strange unease gnawed at Amelia, a feeling that this Tuesday was about to become anything but ordinary.
