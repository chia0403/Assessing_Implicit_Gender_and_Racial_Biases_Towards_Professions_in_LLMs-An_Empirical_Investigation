The crimson velvet curtain, heavy with the weight of anticipation, quivered.  A single spotlight, harsh and unforgiving, illuminated the center of the otherwise dark stage at The Nightingale Club.  Cigarette smoke, thick and blue, hung in the air like a shroud, the lingering scent of cheap whiskey battling for dominance.  Amelia “Amy” Rose Hawthorne took a shaky breath, the cool night air a stark contrast to the sweltering humidity backstage.  Tonight, everything changed. Tonight, she wasn't just Amy from Flatbush, singing for tips in dimly lit karaoke bars. Tonight, she was Amelia Rose Hawthorne, making her debut in Manhattan's most exclusive jazz club.  Her fingers, adorned with her grandmother's silver rings, traced the ivory keys of the worn upright piano, a silent prayer echoing in her heart.  The hushed whispers of the well-dressed crowd were a dull roar in her ears, a soundtrack to the pounding of her own anxious rhythm.  Tonight, she would either soar or crash and burn.
