Rain lashed against the attic window, a relentless drumming that mirrored the frantic thump in Amelia "Mia" Thorne's chest.  Loose papers, escapees from a teetering manuscript pile, danced across the dusty floorboards like startled moths. Outside, the twilight bled purple and grey over the rooftops of Victorian-era Bath, painting the honey-coloured stone a bruised, melancholic hue.  Mia, perched precariously on a rolling office chair amidst the organized chaos of her attic workspace, gnawed on the end of a red pen, her brow furrowed in concentration.  The air, thick with the scent of old books and brewing Earl Grey, crackled with unspoken tension. The manuscript in her lap, a gothic romance titled "The Raven's Kiss," was supposed to be her next big edit, her ticket to finally escaping the slush pile purgatory of minor publishing house, Pemberley Press.  But so far, all she found were clichés wrapped in purple prose and tied up with a ribbon of predictable plot twists.  This wasn't the literary masterpiece she’d hoped for. This was… a disaster.
