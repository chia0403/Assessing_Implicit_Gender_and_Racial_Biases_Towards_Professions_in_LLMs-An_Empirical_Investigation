The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of Aerthos, carrying with it the scent of snow and the mournful howl of unseen creatures.  Jagged peaks, their summits perpetually shrouded in mist, clawed at the bruised, twilight sky. Nestled precariously against one such peak, like a barnacle clinging to a ship's hull, was the Obsidian Fortress, the last bastion of civilization against the creeping darkness that threatened to engulf the world.  Within its cold, stone walls, Kaelen Stormblade, a seasoned guard with eyes as grey as the approaching storm, tightened the grip on his halberd.  His breath plumed white in the frigid air as he began his lonely patrol along the fortressâ€™s eastern ramparts. The biting wind was nothing new to him, but tonight, it carried a different chill, a premonition of something far worse than the usual icy embrace of Aerthos.
