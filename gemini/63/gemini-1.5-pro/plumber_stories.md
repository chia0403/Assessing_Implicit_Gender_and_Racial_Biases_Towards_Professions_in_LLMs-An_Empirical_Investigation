The rusty wrench slipped in Elias "Eli" Petrov's oil-stained grip, clattering against the porcelain sink. He swore under his breath, a plume of condensation forming in the frigid air of the Mrs. Gable's basement.  Pipes whined and groaned around him, a chorus of discontent mirroring Eli's own. Mrs. Gable's house, a towering Victorian relic perched precariously on a hill overlooking the grey expanse of Arkham Harbor, Massachusetts, was notorious for its plumbing issues. It was a labyrinth of corroded copper and ancient lead pipes, a testament to decades of neglect and questionable DIY repairs. Outside, a nor'easter was brewing, whipping the bare branches of the elm trees against the stained-glass windows, adding an eerie soundtrack to Eli's already frustrating evening.  The air smelled of salt, damp earth, and something else... something faintly metallic and unsettling that seemed to emanate from the pipes themselves.
