The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, carrying the scent of brine and sawdust to Elias Thorne.  He pulled his thick wool cap lower over his ears, the knit scratching against the stubble on his jaw.  The sky above the small Orkney island of Eday was a bruised purple, hinting at the snowstorm promised by the radio earlier that morning.  Elias, his calloused hands shoved deep into the pockets of his worn oilskins, surveyed the half-finished frame of the croft house.  The skeletal timbers, lashed together with rope, stood stark against the undulating landscape of heather and exposed rock, a testament to his weeks of solitary labor.  The nearest village, a cluster of stone cottages huddled around a sheltered harbor, was a mile's walk across the windswept moor, a walk Elias was not looking forward to making in the impending blizzard.
