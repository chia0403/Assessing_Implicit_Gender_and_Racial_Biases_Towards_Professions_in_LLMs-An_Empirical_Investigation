The biting November wind whipped around Amelia “Amy” Reyes, snagging at the frayed edges of her Carhartt jacket as she surveyed the scene.  Frozen puddles reflected the sickly yellow glow of the sodium vapor streetlights, painting the dilapidated Victorian mansion in a jaundiced hue.  Wisteria vines, barren and skeletal in the late autumn air, clung to the peeling paint like grasping claws.  Brambles choked the overgrown front yard, and a wrought-iron gate, rusted and groaning on its hinges, stood sentinel before the crumbling stone steps.  Amy exhaled, a puff of white against the gloom, and adjusted the heavy tool bag slung over her shoulder.  This was Oakhaven Manor, her latest call-out, and it radiated an unsettling aura that went beyond simple disrepair. The work order had been vague – “complete electrical failure, possible antiquated wiring” – but the whispered rumors in town hinted at something more… something darker lurking within those decaying walls.  This wasn't going to be a simple rewiring job.
