The flickering neon sign of "A-1 Tax Solutions" cast a sickly green glow across Amelia Pearl Holloway's face as she stared out the frosted glass of her storefront.  Slush, the colour of dirty dishwater, piled against the curb outside, remnants of a late March blizzard that had unexpectedly slammed into Buffalo, New York.

It was a nagging feeling, a premonition almost, that something significant, something potentially dangerous, was lurking just around the corner.
