The biting wind whipped around Elias Thorne's ankles as he hurried down Cobblestone Lane, the gas lamps casting flickering shadows that danced like phantoms on the slick, rain-washed streets of Hollow Creek.  Elias, bundled in a thick wool coat of his own making, clutched a brown paper parcel close to his chest.  It contained a finished commission, a silk evening gown destined for Lady Beatrice Ashworth, the most demanding client in the entire borough. Hollow Creek, a small, isolated town nestled deep in the Moors, wasn't exactly a hub of high fashion, but Lady Ashworth, a transplant from the glittering metropolis of Aethelgard, insisted on maintaining her extravagant lifestyle.  Tonight was her annual Midsummer’s Eve ball, a notoriously lavish affair, and the gown inside Elias’s parcel was, he hoped, going to be the talk of the town.  Above him, the nearly full moon hung like a silver coin in the inky sky, its pale light barely penetrating the swirling mist that clung to the crooked rooftops and shrouded the town in an ethereal, unsettling glow.
