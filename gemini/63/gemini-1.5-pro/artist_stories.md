The salt spray kissed Amelia "Mia" Rodriguez's face as she leaned precariously over the edge of the cliff, her easel perched on a rocky outcrop.  Below, the churning turquoise waters of the Aegean Sea crashed against the volcanic cliffs of Santorini. Whitewashed houses, clinging like barnacles to the steep slopes, tumbled down towards the caldera, their blue domes gleaming under the fierce Greek sun.  Mia, a whirlwind of frenetic energy even in stillness, squinted, her dark braid whipping in the wind.  Her fingers, smudged with cerulean and cadmium yellow, tightened around her charcoal pencil as she attempted to capture the impossible, dazzling light that bathed the island in an almost ethereal glow.  This was her third attempt at capturing the scene, the previous two canvases abandoned in her small, rented studio overlooking the harbour in Oia, deemed inadequate sacrifices to the breathtaking beauty before her.  This time, she swore, this time she would get it right.
