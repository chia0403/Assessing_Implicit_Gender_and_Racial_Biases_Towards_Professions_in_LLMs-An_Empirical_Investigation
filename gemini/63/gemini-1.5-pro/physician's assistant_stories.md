The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorne, PA-C, as he hurried across the cobbled courtyard of St. Jude's Community Hospital, his breath clouding the frigid air.  Nestled in the heart of the rugged, coastal town of Port Blossom, Maine, the hospital was a beacon of warmth and sterile light against the encroaching darkness.  The salt spray from the nearby Atlantic clung to everything, coating the bare branches of the ancient oak trees that lined the perimeter wall like a frosted lattice. Inside, the emergency room buzzed with its usual controlled chaos – a symphony of beeping monitors, hurried footsteps, and hushed, urgent voices. Elias, pulling his worn tweed jacket tighter around him, braced himself for another long shift. The fishing trawlers were due back in port, and experience told him that meant a night of mending nets…and perhaps something more. The scent of brine and impending snow hung heavy in the air, a portent of a storm brewing both outside and within the walls of St. Jude's.
