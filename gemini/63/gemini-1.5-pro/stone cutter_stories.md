The biting wind whipped across the exposed granite slopes of Mount Cinder, carrying with it the scent of pine and the faint, metallic tang of freshly quarried stone. The sky, a bruised purple, promised snow before nightfall.  Elias Thorne, his calloused hands tucked deep into his sheepskin-lined pockets, surveyed the sheer cliff face before him, his breath clouding the air.  The setting sun cast long, dramatic shadows across the quarry, painting the jagged edges of the exposed rock in hues of deep orange and violet. Nestled precariously against the mountainside, Elias's small stone cottage, built from the very rock he carved, clung to the earth like a stubborn lichen. Smoke curled lazily from its chimney, a beacon of warmth against the gathering cold.  Inside, a pot of stew simmered over the hearth, its savory aroma a welcome promise after a long day wrestling with the mountain’s unyielding heart.  This was Elias’s life, a solitary existence etched in stone, as constant and enduring as the granite itself.
