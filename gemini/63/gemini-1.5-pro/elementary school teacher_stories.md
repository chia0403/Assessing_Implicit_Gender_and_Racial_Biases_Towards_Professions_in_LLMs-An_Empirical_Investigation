The aroma of stale coffee and dried-up Play-Doh hung heavy in the air of Mrs. Eleanor Vance’s classroom, a scent she’d come to associate not with failure, but with the messy, vibrant reality of teaching second grade.  Rain lashed against the tall, arched windows of Maplewood Elementary, blurring the vibrant autumn hues of the Vermont woods into a hazy watercolor. Inside, the fluorescent lights hummed a steady, monotonous tune, a stark counterpoint to the chaotic energy that usually filled the room. It was a Friday afternoon, the last day of October, and the sugar rush from the class Halloween party had finally subsided, leaving behind a palpable sense of exhaustion. Eleanor, her auburn hair pulled back in a loose bun, sank into her worn swivel chair, the squeak of its springs a familiar comfort. Scattered across her desk were half-finished grading assignments, a stack of construction paper bats with lopsided wings, and a lone, slightly squashed candy corn. Outside, the wind howled, mirroring the quiet storm brewing inside Eleanor as she contemplated the upcoming parent-teacher conferences.
