The rain hammered against the mullioned windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's office, mirroring the relentless anxiety gnawing at his gut.  His consulting room, nestled on the second floor of a converted Victorian house in the grey, perpetually drizzle-kissed town of Port Rowan, usually offered a sense of calm.  The walls, painted a soothing shade of seafoam green, were adorned with framed prints of botanical studies.  A worn Persian rug softened the polished floorboards, and the air, usually fragrant with the lavender and rosemary growing in the window boxes, was thick today with the petrichor of the storm. But the usual tranquility was absent.  Elias shifted in his leather armchair, the squeak a jarring sound in the otherwise hushed room. He glanced at the ornate clock ticking away on the mantelpiece.  It was almost 7 pm, well past his last scheduled appointment, and the darkness outside was deepening, reflecting the shadows that seemed to be gathering in the corners of his own mind.  He was waiting for a new patient, one whose referral had been shrouded in an unsettling level of secrecy, a patient whose name he only learned moments ago:  Seraphina Blackwood.
