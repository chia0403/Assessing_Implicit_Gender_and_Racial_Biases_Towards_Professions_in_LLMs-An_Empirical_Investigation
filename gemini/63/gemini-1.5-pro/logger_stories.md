The biting wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the Douglas firs, clawing at Jedediah "Jed" Blackwood's thick flannel shirt as if trying to peel it from his broad back. Dawn hadn't yet cracked the horizon, painting the eastern sky a bruised purple, but Jed was already halfway up the logging road, the rumble of his ancient Ford F-100 echoing through the stillness of the Cascade Mountains.  He’d lived in these woods all his thirty-eight years, knew every twist of the rutted track, every whispering stand of pine, every shadowed hollow where the black bears denned for the winter. This morning, however, a new kind of quiet hung in the air, a tense, unnatural hush that settled deep in Jed’s gut like a stone. It wasn't the quiet of winter's slumber, but something else entirely, something that smelled faintly of ozone and rust. He squinted at the towering peaks, their jagged silhouettes barely visible against the pre-dawn gloom, and a shiver ran down his spine, colder than the mountain air.  This morning, the woods held a secret. And Jed Blackwood, whether he liked it or not, was about to find out what it was.
