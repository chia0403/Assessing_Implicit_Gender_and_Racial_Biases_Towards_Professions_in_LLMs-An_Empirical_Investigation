The air in the Bumblebrook Daycare center hummed with the chaotic symphony of toddlers.  Tiny plastic hammers pounded on xylophones, a chorus of "Wheels on the Bus" competed with the insistent beeping of a toy truck, and the smell of apple juice and disinfectant hung heavy in the air.  Sunlight streamed through the large windows, illuminating a whirlwind of finger-painted masterpieces taped to the walls and a scattering of brightly colored building blocks across the worn, multi-colored carpet. Amidst this vibrant chaos, twenty-two-year-old Amelia Grace Hawthorne knelt patiently, coaxing a tearful Leo back to the block castle he'd abandoned in favor of clinging to her leg. Her floral-print dress, perpetually sprinkled with glitter and stray crayon marks, was a testament to her chosen profession. Outside, the late April breeze rustled the leaves of the ancient oak tree that shaded the playground, a silent observer to the daily joys and tantrums within the cheerfully painted walls of Bumblebrook.
