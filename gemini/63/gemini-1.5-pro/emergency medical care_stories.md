The siren's wail sliced through the thick, humid air of New Orleans, echoing off the wrought-iron balconies and brick facades of the French Quarter. Rain, the kind that falls in sheets and reduces visibility to near zero, hammered against the windshield of the ambulance.  Inside, Amelia “Amy” Louise Dubois gripped the steering wheel, her knuckles white, navigating the flooded streets with practiced ease. Her partner, Marcus “Big Easy” Broussard, braced himself against the dashboard, his eyes scanning the street ahead for submerged potholes and floating debris.  It was Mardi Gras season, and though the official parades were over, the revelry – and the resulting emergencies – continued unabated. Tonight, however, felt different. The usual boisterous energy of the Quarter was replaced by a tense, almost eerie quiet, broken only by the rhythmic swish of the windshield wipers and the incessant drumming of the rain.  Dispatch crackled over the radio: "Ambulance Six, we have a possible cardiac arrest, 22 Royal Street.  Expedite." Amy slammed the gas pedal to the floor, the ambulance lurching forward into the storm. 22 Royal.  That was deep in the heart of the Vieux Carré, a labyrinth of narrow streets and hidden courtyards.  And tonight, with the rain and the rising water, it felt like navigating a treacherous maze.
