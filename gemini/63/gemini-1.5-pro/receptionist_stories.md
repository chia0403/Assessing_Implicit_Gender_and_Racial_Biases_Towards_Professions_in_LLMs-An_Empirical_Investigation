Eleanor, in her impeccably tailored navy suit, straightened a stack of embossed business cards, the subtle scent of her jasmine perfume a quiet rebellion against the sterile, metallic tang of the building.  She tapped the intercom button.  "Thorne & Blackwood, good morning." Her voice, trained to a professional, melodic calm, betrayed none of the simmering frustration she felt at being interrupted just as she was about to delve into the latest issue of "Architectural Digest."  This, she thought ruefully, was the glamorous life of a receptionist.
