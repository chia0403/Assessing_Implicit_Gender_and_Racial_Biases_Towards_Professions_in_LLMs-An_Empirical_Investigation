The neon glow of the Big Texan Steak Ranch reflected in the raindrops clinging to the windshield of Jolene "Jo" Carter's Peterbilt 389. Amarillo, Texas, spread out before her like a damp, shimmering circuit board, its arteries of highway buzzing with the late-night hum of eighteen-wheelers just like hers. Rain lashed against the cab, the rhythmic drumming a counterpoint to the mournful whine of the wind whipping across the flat, unforgiving expanse of the Texas Panhandle.  Jo, her long dark hair pulled back in a tight braid, watched the downpour with a sigh. This wasn't the kind of weather that encouraged a woman to tackle a 72oz steak, even if it was free.  She'd been aiming for that free steak ever since she'd started driving rigs six years ago. Tonight, though, the lure of a hot shower and the threadbare comfort of her bunk was stronger than any carnivorous craving.  Besides, something about the stillness in the air, beyond the storm's fury, feltâ€¦ wrong.
