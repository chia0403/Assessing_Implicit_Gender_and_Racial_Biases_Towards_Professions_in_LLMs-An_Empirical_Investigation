The bell above the door to "Nailed It," jingled merrily, announcing another Tuesday morning customer to Seraphina Rose Dubois.  Seraphina, whose name felt far too grand for the strip mall salon she owned and operated, sighed internally.  The scent of acetone and acrylic hung thick in the air, a permanent fixture that she’d long since ceased to notice.  Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the rows of pastel polishes lining the wall.  Outside, the New Jersey November wind howled, rattling the cheap metal security gate pulled down over the shopfront.  Seraphina glanced at the clock – 9:02 AM.  Mrs. Kowalski was two minutes early, again.  She adjusted her leopard-print apron and plastered on a smile, already knowing exactly what shade of pink Mrs. Kowalski would choose.
