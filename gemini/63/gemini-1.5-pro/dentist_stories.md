The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne as he locked up his practice, Thorne Family Dentistry.  The frosted breath puffing from his mouth momentarily obscured the neat gold lettering on the window before dissipating into the twilight.  Oakhaven, Illinois, a town nestled amongst rolling cornfields and stubbornly clinging to its agricultural roots despite the encroaching Chicago suburbs, was settling in for another long winter.  The streetlights flickered to life, casting long, skeletal shadows of bare branches across the freshly fallen dusting of snow. Elias pulled his collar higher, the scent of woodsmoke and pine needles thick in the air, and started his trek home, the crunch of his boots the only sound breaking the quiet of the evening.  He was looking forward to a warm fire, a good book, and the comforting silence of his empty house.  He had no idea that the quiet wouldn't last.
