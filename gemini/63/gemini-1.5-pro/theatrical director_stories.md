The biting November wind whipped around Beatrice "Bea" Aurelia Thorne as she stood on the fire escape of the dilapidated Grand Majestic Theatre, a cigarette clenched between her teeth.  Flakes of rust, disturbed by the gusts, rained down on her worn leather jacket. Below her, the alley reeked of stale beer and desperation, a fitting aroma for a theatre on its last legs.  The Grand Majestic, once the jewel of New Bedford’s theatrical scene, now boasted peeling paint, a leaky roof, and an audience comprised mostly of dust motes and the occasional bewildered pigeon. Bea, however, saw not decay but potential, a sleeping giant waiting for her touch to awaken it. Tonight was the final dress rehearsal for her daring, modern reimagining of "Macbeth," a production she’d poured her heart, soul, and dwindling savings into.  Success meant resurrection for the Majestic, failure meant oblivion for both.  And Beatrice Thorne, a woman who thrived on dramatic tension both on and off the stage, wouldn't have it any other way.
