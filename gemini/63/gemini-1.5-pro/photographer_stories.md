The salt spray kissed Amelia “Millie” Reyes’s face, a familiar sting that mirrored the dull ache in her left knee.  She perched precariously on the jagged cliffs of Inis Mór, the largest of the Aran Islands, her trusty Nikon D850 clutched tight.

The sky, a bruised purple canvas streaked with angry orange, promised a storm. Millie wasn’t there for sunsets though, or even the dramatic seascape.  Her lens was trained on a solitary figure, hunched over amidst the crumbling ruins of Dún Aonghasa, a pre-historic stone fort that clung to the edge of the world.  This wasn't a tourist; this was her subject. A man she had traveled across an ocean and braved the unpredictable Irish weather to find.
