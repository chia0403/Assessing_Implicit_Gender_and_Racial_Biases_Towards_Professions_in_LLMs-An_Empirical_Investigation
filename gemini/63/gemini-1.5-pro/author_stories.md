The salt-laced wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne's auburn braid across her face as she stared out at the churning grey expanse of the North Sea.  Her small cottage, perched precariously on the cliffs of the Yorkshire coast, groaned and shuddered against the gale, a familiar symphony of creaks and rattles that usually lulled her. Today, however, the wind's mournful song only amplified the hollowness that had settled in Amelia's chest.  The cottage, normally her sanctuary, a haven of overflowing bookshelves and the scent of woodsmoke and brewing tea, felt more like a cage.  Three months.  Three months since the words had dried up, since the vibrant characters that usually danced across the pages of her notebooks had fallen silent, leaving her with nothing but a stack of blank paper and a gnawing sense of failure.  Her last novel, a gothic mystery set in the very cliffs that sheltered her, had been a critical and commercial success, catapulting her from obscurity to literary darling.  Now, facing the daunting task of following up that triumph, Amelia felt like a fraud, a one-hit wonder teetering on the brink of oblivion.
