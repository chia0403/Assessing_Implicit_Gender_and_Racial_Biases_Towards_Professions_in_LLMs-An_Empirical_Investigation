The biting wind whipped across the desolate stretch of Interstate 80, stinging Amelia Reyes's cheeks and turning her breath into fleeting white clouds. The Wyoming sky, normally a vibrant blue canvas, was bruised purple and grey, hinting at the approaching blizzard.  Amelia, bundled in layers of fluorescent orange under a thick parka, stomped her feet against the frozen asphalt, trying to coax some life back into her toes. The digital clock on the dash of her orange work truck blinked 5:17 AM, an ungodly hour to be battling the elements, but a rock slide the night before had left a treacherous pile of debris blocking the westbound lane, and Amelia, as the Wyoming Department of Transportation's lead maintenance technician for this section of I-80, was responsible for clearing it.  The flashing hazard lights of her truck cast long, dancing shadows across the snow-dusted highway, the only signs of life for miles in either direction except for the rhythmic whoosh of the wind and the occasional mournful howl of a distant coyote.  The mountains, usually majestic sentinels in the distance, were shrouded in a swirling curtain of snow, making the already isolated stretch of road feel even more remote and forbidding.
