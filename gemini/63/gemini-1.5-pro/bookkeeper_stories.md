The frosted glass of Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s office door declared, in elegant gold lettering, “A.G. Hawthorne, Bookkeeping & Accountancy.”  The lettering was a splurge, Amelia admitted, but it gave her a small thrill every time a client saw it.  Her office, nestled on the second floor of a slightly ramshackle building overlooking the bustling fish market of Grimsby, England, wasn't glamorous. The scent of salt and brine perpetually hung in the air, a stark contrast to the neat rows of ledgers and the faint aroma of lavender polish she used on her desk. Outside, the November wind howled, whipping the North Sea into a frenzy and rattling the windowpanes. Inside, a coal fire crackled merrily in the hearth, casting dancing shadows across the worn Persian rug Amelia had inherited from her grandmother.  It was a Friday afternoon, the kind where the sky turned a bruised purple early, and the promise of a warm pub and a good book beckoned more strongly than any balancing of accounts. Yet, Amelia persisted, her pen scratching diligently across a ledger, meticulously recording the profits and losses of Grimsby’s premier fishmonger, Mr. Perkins.  She had a feeling this particular set of accounts held a secret, and Amelia Grace Hawthorne, with her keen eye for detail and a nose for discrepancies, intended to find it.
