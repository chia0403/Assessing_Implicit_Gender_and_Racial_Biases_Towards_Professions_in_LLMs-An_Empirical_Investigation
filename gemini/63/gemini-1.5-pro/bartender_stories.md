The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of The Rusty Spigot, a rhythm Elias Thorne had come to find strangely comforting.  It was a Tuesday night in Port Blossom, Oregon, a town clinging to the edge of the Pacific like a barnacle to a ship's hull.  The Spigot, nestled between a bait shop and a perpetually closed psychic parlor, was usually bustling with fishermen, dockworkers, and the occasional lost tourist. But tonight, the only company Elias had was the downpour and the ghostly flicker of the neon beer sign in the window.  He wiped down the sticky mahogany bar top, the scent of stale beer and brine clinging to the air like a stubborn seagull. A half-empty bottle of rye sat on a shelf behind him, a testament to the slowness of the evening.  Elias sighed, the sound swallowed by the drumming rain. He adjusted the faded "World's Okayest Bartender" pin on his denim shirt, a gift from his niece, and wondered if anyone would brave the weather tonight.
