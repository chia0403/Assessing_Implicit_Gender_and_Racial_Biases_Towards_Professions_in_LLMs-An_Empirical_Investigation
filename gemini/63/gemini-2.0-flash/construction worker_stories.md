## Story Opening & Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The roar of the concrete saw vibrated through Leo Maxwellâ€™s bones, a familiar thrum that usually soothed him into a rhythmic focus. Today, though, it just amplified the throbbing in his temples. The desert sun beat down mercilessly, turning the sweat clinging to his brow into a salty sting that threatened to drip into his eyes. He wiped it away with the back of his gloved hand, leaving a smear of dust and grease. He hated working Saturdays. Especially Saturdays like this, when the air felt thick enough to choke on and his boss, a man with a voice like gravel gargling, was breathing down his neck about deadlines. But Leo needed the overtime. He needed it like a dying man needed water.

**Setting:**

The setting is a sprawling construction site just outside the burgeoning city of Phoenix, Arizona. The landscape is dominated by the stark beauty of the Sonoran Desert, with distant, hazy mountain ranges shimmering in the heat. The site itself is a chaotic ballet of heavy machinery, exposed rebar, piles of gravel, and the hurried movements of a dozen construction workers. Dust devils dance across the parched earth, swirling around the half-finished foundations of what will eventually be a luxury condominium complex. The air is thick with the smell of diesel, concrete dust, and the faint, metallic tang of welding. A chain-link fence, adorned with faded "Hard Hats Required" signs, marks the perimeter, a stark reminder of the encroaching civilization slowly consuming the desert.
