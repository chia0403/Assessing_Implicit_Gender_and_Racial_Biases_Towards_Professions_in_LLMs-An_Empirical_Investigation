## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights of the warehouse hummed a relentless, discordant symphony with the clatter of forklifts. Inside, amongst towering stacks of cardboard boxes threatening to topple like poorly-played Jenga towers, lived the kingdom of Reginald Fitzwilliam Finch. He ruled not with a scepter, but with a laminated product catalogue, and his crown was the phone headset perpetually perched on his head.

Today, however, even his usual boisterous, borderline-obnoxious energy was struggling to ignite. The phone was silent, the clock on his perpetually messy desk mocking him with its relentless tick-tock. Reginald slumped back in his worn office chair, the vinyl cracking beneath his weight, and stared out at the grey, rain-streaked window. Another dismal Tuesday. Another dismal Tuesday of selling industrial-grade cleaning supplies to people who probably used them to clean up far more interesting things than he could ever imagine.
