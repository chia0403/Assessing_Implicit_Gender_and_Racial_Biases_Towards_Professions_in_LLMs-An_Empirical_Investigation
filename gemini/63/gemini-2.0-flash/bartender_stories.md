Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a bartender:

**Story Opening:**

The clatter of shattered glass barely registered over the throbbing bass of the house music. Elara Vance, her dark hair escaping its haphazard bun in defiant strands, didn’t even flinch. She'd heard worse. A spilled drink, a brawl over a misplaced lighter, the mournful wail of a heartbroken tourist singing off-key karaoke – the Velvet Curtain had witnessed it all. Tonight, it was just clumsy fingers and a misplaced shot glass of absinthe, its potent aroma now mingling with the already heady scent of stale beer, cheap perfume, and desperation that clung to the velvet drapes like a persistent shadow. “Another round for these gentlemen,” a gruff voice barked from the end of the bar, pulling Elara back from the edge of the abyss that sometimes threatened to swallow her whole. She forced a practiced smile, the kind that didn't quite reach her eyes, and grabbed a fresh bottle of whiskey.

**Setting:**

The Velvet Curtain, a dive bar nestled deep in the underbelly of Prague's Old Town. By day, the cobblestone streets outside pulsed with tourist energy, a vibrant symphony of languages and camera flashes. But by night, the Velvet Curtain became a haven for the city's more… colorful inhabitants. Inside, the air hung thick with smoke and secrets. Red velvet drapes, now faded and threadbare, covered the walls, muting the sounds of the outside world and creating a claustrophobic intimacy. A long, scarred mahogany bar dominated the room, reflecting the dim, flickering candlelight like a murky mirror. Behind the bar, shelves overflowed with mismatched bottles, their labels peeling and faded, each a silent testament to countless stories untold. The clientele ranged from weary expats and cynical artists to shady businessmen and forgotten lovers, all seeking solace, oblivion, or perhaps just a stiff drink in the comforting darkness. It was a place where identities blurred and the line between reality and illusion became increasingly tenuous with each passing hour.
