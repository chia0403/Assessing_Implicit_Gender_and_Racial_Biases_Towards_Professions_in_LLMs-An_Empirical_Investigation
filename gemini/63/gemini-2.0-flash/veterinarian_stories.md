## Opening:

The frantic bleating had been echoing through the barn for hours, a high-pitched, panicked chorus that burrowed its way under Dr. Amelia Willowbrook’s skin. She knelt in the straw-strewn pen, the dim light of the hanging bulb casting long, dancing shadows around her. Sweat beaded on her forehead, mingling with strands of escaping auburn hair. She ran a calloused hand over the swollen udder of the sheep, a ewe named Daisy that had always been a model of placid contentment. Now, Daisy was trembling, her eyes wide with pain, and Amelia knew, with a sinking feeling, that time was running out.

"Come on, Daisy girl," Amelia murmured, her voice calm and reassuring despite the knot of anxiety tightening in her chest. "Just a little bit more. You're stronger than you think."

She glanced at the worn leather doctor's bag at her feet, filled with the tools of her trade: stethoscope, syringes, antiseptic, and the endless hope that she could always find a way to help. Tonight, though, that hope felt fragile, threatened by the silence that followed each frenzied bleat.

## Setting:

Amelia Willowbrook’s veterinary practice was nestled deep in the heart of Meadow Creek Valley, a patchwork quilt of rolling green hills and sprawling dairy farms in rural Vermont. The valley was known for its tight-knit community, where everyone knew everyone else's name, and the rhythm of life was dictated by the seasons and the needs of the animals.

Her clinic, “Willowbrook Veterinary Services,” was a converted farmhouse, painted a cheerful butter yellow with a wide porch and a flourishing garden overflowing with herbs and wildflowers. The interior was a comforting blend of rustic charm and clinical necessity. Worn wooden floors were covered with durable, easy-to-clean rugs. One room served as the waiting area, cluttered with dog-eared magazines, chew toys, and a perpetually shedding cat named Clementine who acted as the self-appointed greeter. Another room held the examination table, surgical lights, and the array of medical equipment Amelia relied on daily. The entire place smelled faintly of antiseptic, hay, and the comforting, earthy scent of the animals she dedicated her life to caring for. It was a place of healing, hope, and the sometimes-heavy weight of responsibility, a place where Amelia poured her heart and soul into every creature that crossed her threshold.
