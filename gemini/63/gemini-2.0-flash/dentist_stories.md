## Story Opening:

The high-pitched whine of the drill usually didn't bother Dr. Eleanor Vivian Fairchild. After fifteen years battling sugar-fueled dental decay in the mouths of Maple Creek, she'd become almost immune to it. But today, the sound vibrated in her chest, a relentless thrumming that amplified the knot of anxiety tightening in her stomach.

She paused, retracting the suction, and gazed at Mrs. Higgins, whose eyes, magnified behind safety glasses, held a mixture of fear and forced stoicism. "Almost done, Mrs. Higgins," Eleanor said, her voice deliberately soothing. "Just polishing up this filling and we'll have you good as new."

Mrs. Higgins offered a weak smile, a silent plea for the ordeal to end. Eleanor knew the feeling. It was a universal sentiment, shared by almost every patient who graced the worn linoleum floor of Fairchild Family Dentistry. And lately, Eleanor suspected, she was feeling it too. The overwhelming urge to just... *end* something.

She resumed polishing, the tiny brush whirring against the newly filled molar. Her gaze drifted past Mrs. Higgins's head, past the cheerful, albeit dated, wallpaper patterned with smiling cartoon teeth, and out the window.

## Setting:

Maple Creek, nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, was a town where time moved a little slower. Fairchild Family Dentistry, a small, one-story building with a faded blue awning, sat on Main Street, right between the hardware store and the bakery. The building itself was older than Eleanor, built back in the 1950s by her grandfather, Dr. Samuel Fairchild, the town's first and only dentist for decades. The waiting room was cluttered with well-worn magazines, a mismatched collection of children's toys, and the lingering scent of fluoride and freshly brewed coffee, a scent that had permeated the very walls over generations.

Eleanor had inherited more than just the practice; she'd inherited a legacy, a responsibility to the people of Maple Creek. A responsibility that was starting to feel less like a calling and more like a gilded cage.
