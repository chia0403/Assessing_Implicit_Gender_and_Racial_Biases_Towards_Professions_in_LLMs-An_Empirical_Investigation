## Story Opening:

The pre-dawn air was thick and soupy, clinging to everything like a guilty conscience. Outside the cab of his rig, 'The Wanderer,' the world was a monochrome wash of grey, punctuated only by the flickering neon of the Lonely Star Diner. Inside, a mug of lukewarm coffee did little to thaw the creeping chill that had settled into Jedidiah Ezekiel Harding's bones. He’d been hauling a load of Maine lobsters down to Miami for the past two days, and the constant vibration of the road, coupled with the erratic sleep schedule, was starting to wear him thin.

He squinted at the clock on the dashboard. 4:17 AM. Just enough time for a quick refill and a slice of that suspiciously glowing cherry pie before hitting the road again. As he reached for his wallet, a news report crackled through the speakers, the announcer’s voice hushed and urgent. Jedidiah paused, a gut feeling prickling the back of his neck. He never paid much mind to the news; politics were a highway full of potholes, best avoided altogether. But something in the announcer's tone made him hesitate.

"…authorities are advising residents within a fifty-mile radius of Blackwood National Forest to stay indoors. The reports remain unconfirmed, but witnesses describe…unusual activity… including strange lights and unexplained seismic disturbances…"

Jedidiah scoffed. Probably some kids pulling a prank. Still, Blackwood National Forest. That was right on his route, just past Savannah. He drained the last of his coffee, a bad taste lingering on his tongue. He had a feeling this run was about to get a whole lot more interesting.

## Setting:

The story begins in the early hours of the morning at the **Lonely Star Diner**, a greasy spoon establishment clinging to the side of Interstate 95 in rural **South Carolina**. The diner is a classic roadside attraction, a relic of a bygone era with its chrome trim, vinyl booths, and permanently stained countertops. It's the kind of place where the coffee is strong, the food is cheap, and the conversation is even cheaper.

Outside, the interstate stretches into the distance, a ribbon of grey asphalt winding through a landscape of pine forests and sprawling farmland. The air is heavy with the scent of pine needles and damp earth, a promise of rain hanging in the air. The only light comes from the diner's neon sign and the occasional headlights of passing trucks, cutting through the dense fog like spectral eyes. Beyond the highway, in the distance, lies the looming darkness of **Blackwood National Forest**, a vast, untamed wilderness steeped in local legends and whispers of things unseen. The forest is a place where the trees grow thick and gnarled, where the shadows are deep and long, and where the modern world seems to fade away, leaving only the ancient whispers of the wild. This forest is a critical element to the story's unfolding events and will become a much more significant setting later on.
