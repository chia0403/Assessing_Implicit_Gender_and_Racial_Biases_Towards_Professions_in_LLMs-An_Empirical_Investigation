## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights of the senior center buzzed overhead, a constant, irritating hum that mirrored the nervous flutter in Dr. Amelia Eleanor Davies’s stomach. Usually, Amelia thrived in these situations – workshops on healthy eating for the elderly were her bread and butter, so to speak. But today felt different. Today, she was staring at a sea of prune-colored faces, all fixed on her with a disconcerting blend of skepticism and expectation.

Amelia cleared her throat, adjusted the microphone clipped to her crisp, white lab coat, and plastered on what she hoped was a reassuring smile. "Good afternoon, everyone! My name is Dr. Amelia Eleanor Davies, and I'm a registered dietician..."

She trailed off, her words lost in the sudden, ear-splitting screech of a bingo caller announcing "B-4!" The room erupted in cheers and groans, temporarily eclipsing her presence. Amelia sighed internally. This was going to be a long afternoon.

## Setting:

The story is set in the **"Sunset Glades Senior Center"** in **Clearwater, Florida**. The main room, where Amelia is conducting her workshop, is a large, brightly lit space decorated with faded pastel walls and generic landscape paintings. Rows of folding chairs are arranged in front of a small stage, which is currently adorned with a banner that reads: "Eat Healthy, Live Happy!" - the irony of which is not lost on Amelia. 

Off to one side, a small kitchen hums with the scent of institutional coffee and microwaved meals. The air is thick with the perfume of lavender-scented hand lotion, stale cigarette smoke (despite the "No Smoking" signs), and a general sense of quiet resignation. Beyond the main room, glimpses can be caught of other activities: a group playing mahjong, a couple slow dancing to a dusty record player, and a cluster of residents gathered around the television in the corner, their faces illuminated by the flickering light.
