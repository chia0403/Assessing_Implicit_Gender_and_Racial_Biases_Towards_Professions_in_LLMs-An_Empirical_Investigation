The biting wind, laced with the scent of salt and seaweed, clawed at the thick woolen curtains of "Needles & Threads," Bartholomew "Bart" Finch's humble tailoring shop. Outside, the fishing village of Port Blossom, nestled precariously on the craggy Cornish coast, was slowly succumbing to the twilight. The cobblestone street, usually bustling with fishermen mending nets and gossiping housewives haggling over the price of mackerel, was now deserted save for the occasional scuttling gull. The air held a premonition of a storm, a familiar yet unsettling presence in this isolated corner of the world.

Inside, the shop was a haven of warmth and order. A crackling fire roared merrily in the hearth, casting dancing shadows on the rows of neatly arranged spools of thread, bolts of vibrant fabric, and the gleaming scissors that hung from a peg near Bart's well-worn workbench. The scent of beeswax, lanolin, and the lingering aroma of pipe tobacco hung heavy in the air, a comforting blend that was as much a part of Bart's identity as his calloused fingers and keen eye for detail. Bartholomew Finch, a man whose age was etched on his face in the fine lines around his kind, hazel eyes, paused in his stitching, a half-finished navy blue pea coat lying across his lap. He glanced out the window, a knot of unease tightening in his chest. The storm was coming, he could feel it in his bones, and something else... something darker.
