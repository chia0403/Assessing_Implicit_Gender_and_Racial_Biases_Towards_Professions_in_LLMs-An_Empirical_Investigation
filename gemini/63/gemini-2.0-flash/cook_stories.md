## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The flickering gaslights of Rue de la Fontaine-au-Roi painted the cobblestones in an uneven wash of yellow. The air, thick with the scent of roasting chestnuts, cheap perfume, and the ever-present miasma rising from the Seine, clung to everything. It was a chilly November evening in 1888, and the final patrons were trickling out of the Belle Époque brasserie, "Le Coq Hardi."

**Opening:**

The rhythmic clang of copper against iron was the only sound above the soft murmur of the cleaning staff. Auguste Ferdinand Dubois, chef de cuisine of Le Coq Hardi, stood hunched over a massive stockpot, his broad back a silhouette against the dying embers in the hearth. He tasted the broth, a deep, savory concoction built upon the bones of the day's roasted pheasant, his brow furrowed in concentration. A pinch more thyme, perhaps? Or was it a whisper of tarragon he detected, threatening to overpower the delicate balance? Auguste’s life was a constant, meticulous calibration of flavors, a dance between tradition and intuition. Tonight, however, the broth was proving as elusive as a whispered secret in a crowded cafe. He sighed, the sound lost in the steam rising from the pot. Tonight, the problem wasn't the broth. Tonight, the problem was Elsie.
