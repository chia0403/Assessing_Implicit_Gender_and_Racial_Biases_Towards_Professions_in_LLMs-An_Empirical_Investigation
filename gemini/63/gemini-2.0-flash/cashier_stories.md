The fluorescent lights of the "Quik Stop & Go" buzzed with a relentless, low-frequency hum that threatened to drill a hole straight through Eleanor Beatrice Ainsworth's skull. It was 2:17 PM on a Tuesday, the deadest time of the week, and the only sounds besides the buzzing were the rhythmic clatter of the conveyor belt and the occasional groan of the ancient refrigerator cases holding lukewarm sodas and wilting lettuce. Outside, the July heat shimmered off the cracked asphalt of the parking lot, baking the row of dusty cars parked haphazardly along the faded yellow lines.

Eleanor, who usually found solace in the predictable monotony of her job, was finding it particularly grating today. A migraine, brewing since the morning, had finally settled behind her eyes like a hot stone. She leaned her elbows on the worn Formica countertop, her gaze fixed on the chipped corner of the "Employee Must Wash Hands" sign above the sink, willing the throbbing to subside. Even the smell of stale coffee, usually a comforting presence, felt aggressive and cloying. All she wanted was to close her eyes for five minutes, to escape the hum and the heat and the general feeling of beige that permeated everything inside the Quik Stop & Go, but duty, and the stern gaze of Mr. Henderson’s laminated photo behind the till, kept her rooted in place. Today, the Quik Stop & Go felt less like a convenience store and more like a purgatorial waiting room for a life that wasn’t quite happening.
