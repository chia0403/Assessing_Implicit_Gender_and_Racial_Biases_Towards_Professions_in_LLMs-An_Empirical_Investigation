**Opening:**

The insistent chirp of a robin, usually a welcome sound, felt like a mocking alarm clock to Eleanor "Ellie" Davies. Sunlight, diluted by the grimy film on her window, sliced across her face. She groaned, burying her head deeper into the threadbare pillow. Last night’s cheap whiskey and the late-night deep dive into the city archives were conspiring to punish her. Another sunrise in Havenwood, another day chasing shadows.

**Setting:**

Havenwood, Pennsylvania, wasn't a place most people aspired to live. Once a thriving hub for steel manufacturing, the industry had long since crumbled, leaving behind a skeleton of rusting factories and boarded-up storefronts. The air hung thick with the ghosts of prosperity and a lingering scent of industrial decay. Ellie’s apartment, above a perpetually empty laundromat on Elm Street, was a testament to the town's decline. The walls were thin, the plumbing temperamental, and the view was a depressing panorama of grey brick and forgotten dreams. Yet, Havenwood held a strange grip on her. It was a town built on secrets, and Ellie, a journalist with a nose for uncovering them, had arrived determined to exhume them, one forgotten headline at a time. She wrote for the *Havenwood Herald*, a scrappy local paper fighting for survival in the digital age, its headlines a constant stream of petty crime, school board squabbles, and the annual pumpkin festival. But Ellie knew there was more to Havenwood than met the eye, something darker and more compelling lurking beneath the surface, waiting to be brought to light.
