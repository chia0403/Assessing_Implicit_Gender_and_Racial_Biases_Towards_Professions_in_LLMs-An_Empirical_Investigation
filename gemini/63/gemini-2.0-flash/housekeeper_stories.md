The scent of lemon polish and old money hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume that had clung to Eleanor Margaret Ainsworth since she first stepped foot in Ravenwood Manor five years ago. Dust motes danced in the shafts of afternoon sunlight that pierced through the gargantuan, gothic windows of the Grand Salon. Eleanor, perched precariously on a mahogany chair, stretched her arm, her duster a pathetic little cloud against the vast, ornate ceiling. She was trying to reach the head of a particularly grumpy-looking cherub that formed part of the elaborate plasterwork, the cherub’s sneer seemingly mocking her efforts.

Ravenwood Manor, nestled deep within the misty hills of Derbyshire, was a sprawling, imposing estate that had been in the Ravenwood family for generations. It was a testament to opulence and a monument to decaying grandeur, its shadowed corridors whispering tales of forgotten fortunes and whispered scandals. Eleanor wasn’t privy to the scandals, not really. But she knew the secrets that resided in the dusty corners, the cobwebs that clung to faded portraits, and the subtle shift in the air when the current Lord Ravenwood, the enigmatic Mr. Alistair Ravenwood, was near. He rarely ventured from his study, a room Eleanor had only cleaned twice in her entire tenure, a room that felt colder and darker than any other in the house.

Outside, the wind howled, rattling the ancient window panes. Winter was tightening its grip on Ravenwood Manor, and Eleanor knew, with a sigh, that the already daunting task of keeping the place habitable was about to become even more arduous. She just hoped she could reach that cherub before its sneer became unbearable.
