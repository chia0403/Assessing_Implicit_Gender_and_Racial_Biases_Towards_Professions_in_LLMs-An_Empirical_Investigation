## Story Opening and Setting

**Opening:**

The smell of burnt rubber and stale coffee hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Bartholomew "Bart" Finch. He swore he could taste it in his morning cereal sometimes. This morning, the burnt rubber smell was particularly strong, likely emanating from the mangled mess that was currently occupying bay number four. Bart squinted, the fluorescent lights reflecting off the greasy smudges on his safety glasses. The twisted metal and shattered plastic of what used to be a gleaming cherry-red Mustang were a stark reminder of just how quickly things could go wrong on the winding roads of Willow Creek County.

He sighed, grabbing his well-worn toolbox. Another day, another mangled machine, another puzzle to solve. He just hoped this one didn't involve too much blood.

**Setting:**

Bart's Auto Repair, a single-story, cinder block building painted a faded blue, sat just on the outskirts of Willow Creek, a small, rural town nestled in the rolling hills of Willow Creek County, Virginia. The surrounding landscape was a patchwork of farms, vineyards, and dense forests, all connected by a network of winding country roads notorious for their blind curves and unexpected wildlife crossings. The shop itself was a testament to Bart's pragmatism and dedication. It wasn't pretty, but it was functional. Three bays, each equipped with a lift and a collection of tools that ranged from state-of-the-art diagnostic equipment to decades-old wrenches passed down from his grandfather, lined the main area. The walls were adorned with calendars featuring vintage car ads, faded pin-up posters, and hand-drawn diagrams illustrating the inner workings of various engines. A perpetually cluttered office, crammed with spare parts, invoices, and half-eaten sandwiches, sat at the back, separated from the main workshop by a grimy glass window. Outside, a small, gravel-covered parking lot housed a motley collection of vehicles awaiting repair, ranging from rusted-out pickup trucks to luxury sedans sporting significant dents and scratches.
