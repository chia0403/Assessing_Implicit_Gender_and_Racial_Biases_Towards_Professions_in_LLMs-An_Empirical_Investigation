The stale, metallic scent of printer ink clung to the air like a stubborn ghost, a fitting perfume for the newsroom of the dying newspaper. Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the *Albany Argus*, mirroring the tempest brewing in Victoria Eleanor Blackwood’s gut. 

It was 3:17 AM. Victoria, usually a stickler for deadlines, slumped back in her creaky office chair, the headline shimmering mockingly on her laptop screen: "LOCAL GROCERY CHAIN FACES PRICE GOUGING ALLEGATIONS." Riveting stuff. Pulitzer-worthy, she thought with a snort that disturbed a nearby pigeon roosting on the fire escape.

Victoria had been a reporter at the *Argus* for fifteen years, starting as an eager intern fuelled by idealism and strong coffee. Now, she was fuelled mostly by caffeine, cheap takeout, and a nagging sense that she was wasting her life chasing stories about cat shows and community garden disputes.

The setting was the skeletal remains of the *Albany Argus* building on Clinton Avenue, a once-grand Victorian structure that had seen better days. Decades of budget cuts had ravaged it. Leaky ceilings left damp patches on the walls, the once-ornate woodwork was chipped and peeling, and the air perpetually hung heavy with the mournful echoes of typewriters that had long fallen silent. Most of her colleagues had been bought out or transferred. Victoria remained, partly out of loyalty, partly out of stubbornness, and partly because she had nowhere else to go. This city, this paper, this life – it was all she knew. And right now, staring at the bland headline, she felt like she knew it far too well.
