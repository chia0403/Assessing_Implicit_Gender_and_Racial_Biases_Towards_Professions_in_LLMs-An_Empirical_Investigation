The salt spray, thick and biting, hammered against the leaded-glass windows of the Captain's Quarters. Inside, however, a bubble of tranquility stubbornly persisted, painstakingly cultivated by Eleanor Beatrice Ainsworth, interior decorator extraordinaire. She hummed a light, jazzy tune under her breath, a stark contrast to the mournful shriek of gulls circling outside. Eleanor knelt amongst a sea of swatches – velvet in shades of deep sea teal, linen the color of sun-bleached sand, and silk that shimmered like captured moonbeams. Her meticulously manicured fingers, tipped with a surprisingly practical navy blue, carefully sorted through them, the rhythmic tap of her signet ring against the polished oak floor the only sound louder than her humming.

Eleanor was on Penhale Island, a windswept, largely uninhabited speck off the coast of Cornwall, a place favored by artists and hermits seeking solace from the relentless march of the modern world. She was here on assignment, tasked with breathing new life into the crumbling grandeur of Penhale Manor, a sprawling, gothic monstrosity perched precariously on the cliffs. The Manor, ancestral home of the eccentric and notoriously reclusive Lord Ashworth, had been neglected for decades, left to the mercy of the elements and the encroaching ivy. Now, Lord Ashworth, in a rare moment of social ambition (or perhaps a sudden fear of his property collapsing into the sea), had decided to drag it kicking and screaming into the 21st century. And Eleanor, with her unparalleled eye for detail and a backbone of pure steel disguised beneath layers of silk and charm, was just the woman to do it. The challenge was immense, the location remote, and the client… well, he was a character to say the least. But Eleanor thrived on the impossible. After all, turning crumbling castles into stylish sanctuaries was her specialty.
