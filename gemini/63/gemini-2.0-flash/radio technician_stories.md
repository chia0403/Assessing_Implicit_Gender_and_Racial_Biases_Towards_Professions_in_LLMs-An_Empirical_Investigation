The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, whistling a mournful tune through the rusted antennae that clawed at the perpetually grey sky. Inside the Port Bramblehead Coastal Listening Station, a small, brick building that seemed to hunch against the elements, the air was thick with the smell of solder, dust, and disappointment. Eleanor Rose Bellweather, radio technician extraordinaire and sole occupant of this lonely post, sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. The dial of the vintage Eddystone receiver, her pride and joy, stubbornly refused to settle on anything more interesting than static.

Port Bramblehead itself was a dying town, clinging precariously to the edge of England's eastern coast. Once a bustling hub for fishing and trade, it was now mostly populated by seagulls, memories, and a dwindling number of residents who hadn't yet packed their bags for the promise of brighter futures further inland. The Listening Station, built during the war and subsequently repurposed for maritime distress signals, was, like the town, a forgotten relic. Eleanor, however, found a strange solace in its solitude and the crackling hum of the radios, a connection to the wider world that Bramblehead had long since lost.
