## Story Opening:

The scent of old paper and lukewarm Earl Grey clung to Eleanor Beatrice Ainsworth like a second skin. It was the aroma of her life, the comforting, slightly musty perfume of her tiny office nestled in the labyrinthine bowels of Ainsworth & Sons, Literary Purveyors - a family business so old, the "Sons" hadn't been updated in at least three generations. Sunlight, a rare and precious commodity down here in the archive, slanted weakly through the single, grime-streaked window, illuminating swirling motes of dust dancing in the air. Eleanor, hunched over a manuscript titled "The Corpse Candle Conspiracy," chewed thoughtfully on the end of her pen, a habit that drove her impeccably-groomed, perfectly-suited older brother, Charles, absolutely spare.

Another rejection. Sighing, she scribbled a polite, yet firm, paragraph explaining why Mr. Archibald Pimpleworth's tale of gaslit shenanigans and sentient wax wouldn't quite fit their current catalogue. It wasn't terrible, exactly. Just... predictable. Eleanor longed for something truly original, something that would shake the dust off these venerable shelves and remind the world that Ainsworth & Sons still had its finger on the pulse of literary genius.

The phone buzzed on her cluttered desk, jolting her from her reverie. She picked it up, already anticipating Charles's clipped tones and a litany of complaints about the dwindling profits and the need to "modernize," a word that sent shivers of dread down her spine.

"Eleanor Ainsworth speaking," she said, bracing herself for the inevitable lecture.

## Setting:

Eleanor Beatrice Ainsworth's office is a small, cramped space in the basement of Ainsworth & Sons, Literary Purveyors, a Victorian-era publishing house located in a quiet, cobblestoned street in Bloomsbury, London.

*   **The Room:** Bookshelves, overflowing with aged manuscripts and bound volumes, line every wall, reaching almost to the low, arched ceiling. A single, grime-streaked window offers a meager glimpse of the world outside. The air is perpetually dusty and smells faintly of old paper and stale tea.
*   **The Desk:** A large, mahogany desk, inherited from her grandfather, dominates the room. It's piled high with manuscripts, rejection letters, editing tools, and half-empty teacups.
*   **The Furnishings:** A worn leather armchair sits in one corner, a silent invitation to escape into the written word. An antique globe, its countries rendered in faded colours, rests on a small table, a reminder of the wider world beyond the basement walls.
*   **Atmosphere:** The atmosphere is one of quiet contemplation and scholarly dedication, tinged with a hint of melancholy. The room feels frozen in time, a refuge from the bustling modernity of London above.
