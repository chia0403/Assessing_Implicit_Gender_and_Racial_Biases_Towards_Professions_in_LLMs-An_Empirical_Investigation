The sickly sweet scent of burnt sugar and despair hung thick in the air of the breakroom, clinging to the chipped linoleum floor and the perpetually stained coffee maker. It was a smell Amelia Josephine Bellweather knew intimately; it was the scent of Mondays at Goldstein, Finch, and Sterling. Amelia, a paralegal with seven years under her belt and the calluses to prove it, sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose. Another burnt batch of Mr. Henderson’s “famous” caramelized pecans. Another week facing down mountains of discovery documents, petulant partners, and the lingering specter of her slowly evaporating student loan debt.

The setting was a nondescript office building in downtown Boston, sandwiched between a dry cleaner advertising suspiciously cheap alterations and a dimly lit bar whose primary clientele seemed to be pigeons and regret. The building itself, 12 Beacon Street, was a monument to faded glory, its once-grand facade now marred by pigeon droppings and the relentless grind of city life. Goldstein, Finch, and Sterling occupied the entire seventh floor, a warren of cramped offices divided by flimsy partitions that offered little in the way of privacy. The decor could best be described as “Early 1980s Lawyer,” featuring a color palette of muted browns and beiges, punctuated by the occasional wilting philodendron in a terracotta pot.
