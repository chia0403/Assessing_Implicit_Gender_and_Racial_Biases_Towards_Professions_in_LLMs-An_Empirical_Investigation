**Story Opening:**

The whirring of the laser printer was the only sound breaking the silence of a Tuesday morning that felt determined to be aggressively beige. Even the rain, drumming a monotonous rhythm against the panoramic window, seemed reluctant to commit to anything more interesting than a gentle drizzle. Eleanor "Ellie" Mae Kensington sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. Another day, another parade of impeccably dressed executives breezing through the lobby, barely sparing her a glance as they chased deals and deadlines. She wondered, not for the first time, if anyone actually saw her – really *saw* Ellie Mae, the woman behind the sleek, minimalist reception desk, and not just the smiling face that greeted them with a perfectly memorized list of names and conference room numbers.

**Setting:**

The gleaming, modern lobby of Kensington & Associates, a high-powered investment firm located on the 47th floor of the Zenith Tower in downtown Chicago. Everything in the lobby screamed success: the Italian marble floor, polished to a blinding sheen; the oversized abstract art piece that looked vaguely like a shattered Picasso; the meticulously arranged orchids, their delicate blooms reaching towards the sunlight that, on a good day, streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows offering a breathtaking view of Lake Michigan. Even the air felt expensive, subtly infused with the scent of sandalwood and ambition. The reception desk itself was a monolithic slab of dark wood, its smooth surface broken only by a state-of-the-art computer, a multi-line telephone, and a small, framed photo of Ellie’s grumpy ginger cat, Winston. The entire space was designed to impress, to convey an image of unwavering confidence and undeniable wealth – a fitting facade for the financial machinations that took place within.
