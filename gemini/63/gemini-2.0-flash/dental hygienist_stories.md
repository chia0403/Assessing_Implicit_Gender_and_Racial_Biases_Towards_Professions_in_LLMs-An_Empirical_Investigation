The fluorescent lights hummed their monotonous tune, a familiar soundtrack to the clinking of metal instruments and the whir of the ultrasonic scaler. Inside the small, brightly-lit operatory of "Dr. Evelyn Reed's Family Dentistry" in the sleepy town of Willow Creek, Oregon, **Seraphina Willowbrook** meticulously flossed the molars of a nervous ten-year-old boy named Timmy. Outside, a typical Oregon rain pattered gently against the frosted window, blurring the view of the Douglas firs lining Main Street. Seraphina, however, was oblivious to the weather. Her focus was entirely on eradicating the stubborn patch of plaque clinging to Timmy's lower right. She wasn't just cleaning teeth; she was building trust, one gentle scrape and encouraging word at a time. This was her sanctuary, her contribution to the world, and the small, cozy space that allowed her to lose herself in the details, a welcome distraction from the quiet unease that had been simmering beneath the surface of her life lately.
