The July sun hammered down on the black asphalt, radiating heat that shimmered in the distance. The air, thick with exhaust fumes and the scent of melting tar, hung heavy around the orange cones that peppered Interstate 80 just west of Truckee, California. **Margaret Elizabeth "Maggie" O'Connell** wiped a bead of sweat from her brow with the back of her gloved hand, leaving a smudge of grime across her forehead.

She straightened, cracking her spine with a satisfying pop, and surveyed her little kingdom of inconvenience. Lane closures, blinking warning signs, and the endless roar of semi-trucks whizzing past just inches away â€“ it was a symphony of chaos Maggie knew by heart. Today, she and her crew were patching potholes, a thankless job that kept the artery connecting the Golden State to the rest of the country from completely crumbling.

The setting wasn't glamorous. A portable toilet sat precariously balanced on the shoulder of the road, its plastic door creaking ominously in the wind. Their crew truck, a battered Ford F-350 named Bessie (affectionately, and slightly sarcastically, by Maggie), was parked a short distance away, its air conditioning fighting a losing battle against the oppressive heat. Beyond the highway, the jagged silhouette of the Sierra Nevada mountains rose majestically, their snow-capped peaks a cruel reminder of the cooler temperatures just a few miles away.

Maggie sighed, adjusted her safety vest, and grabbed her shovel. It was going to be a long, hot day on the I-80, and Maggie O'Connell, queen of the potholes, was ready to rule.
