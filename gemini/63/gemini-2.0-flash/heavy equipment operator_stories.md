The humid air hung thick and heavy over the Florida Everglades, clinging to everything like a damp shroud. Gnats buzzed aggressively around the cab of the bulldozer, a nuisance Jebediah "Jeb" Ezekiel Thompson usually ignored, but today, they felt especially irritating, mirroring the simmering frustration building inside him. He swatted at them half-heartedly with a calloused hand, leaving a smear of sweat and dirt on the already grimy window.

Jeb, a man built like the oak trees he occasionally had to uproot with his D9, sat perched on the edge of his seat, the engine idling beneath him like a caged beast. The rising sun, a bruised orange in the polluted sky, cast long, skeletal shadows of the cypress trees across the expanse of reclaimed land. This wasn't the kind of scenery Jeb usually appreciated. He preferred the untouched wildness, the chaotic symphony of croaking frogs and screeching birds, to the methodical destruction he was paid to enact. But progress, as they called it, demanded its dues.

Jeb's job, and that of the sprawling construction crew scattered across the vast wetland, was to prepare this section of the Everglades for a new luxury resort. Golf courses, swimming pools, and pastel-colored condominiums were set to replace the sawgrass and muddy waterways, a sacrifice deemed necessary for the flourishing economy of Miami, a city that always seemed to be hungry for more. Jebediah "Jeb" Ezekiel Thompson just wished progress didn't taste so much like the dying earth. He killed the engine, the sudden silence amplifying the whirring of insects and the distant rumble of thunder that promised another afternoon downpour. Today feltâ€¦off.
