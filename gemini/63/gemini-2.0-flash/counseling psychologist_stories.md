Okay, here's a story opening and setting, introducing our counseling psychologist main character:

**Opening:**

The scent of damp earth and dying chrysanthemums clung to Dr. Eleanor Vance’s tweed blazer as she unlocked the wrought-iron gate.  The air, thick with October’s melancholy, seemed to seep right into her bones, mirroring the familiar weight she carried in her practice. Another Tuesday evening, another litany of anxieties, regrets, and fractured hopes echoing in the sterile, beige-painted walls of her office.  She sighed, the sound lost in the rustling of leaves underfoot.  Sometimes, even after fifteen years of listening, Eleanor felt like a sponge, saturated with everyone else's pain, unable to wring herself dry.  Tonight, the sponge felt particularly full.

**Setting:**

Dr. Eleanor Vance’s practice, “The Anchorage,” was nestled in the quiet, historic district of Alexandria, Virginia. The building itself was a three-story Victorian house, painted a stately shade of gray with crisp white trim.  It had been converted into professional offices decades ago, but retained much of its original charm: stained-glass windows depicting allegorical scenes, creaking hardwood floors, and an intricate crown molding that Eleanor always found oddly comforting. Her office was on the second floor, overlooking a small, overgrown garden.  Inside, she’d tried to create a calming atmosphere: soft lighting, comfortable armchairs upholstered in muted blues and greens, and carefully chosen artwork depicting landscapes and seascapes.  A small, antique writing desk sat tucked into a corner, overflowing with client files, appointment books, and a collection of well-worn psychology textbooks.  Despite her best efforts, however, the faint scent of disinfectant, lingering from the building's cleaning crew, always seemed to undermine the tranquility she was striving for, a constant reminder of the clinical reality lurking beneath the surface.
