## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The biting November wind howled off Lake Michigan, rattling the windows of the modest, brick-faced office building on Milwaukee's East Side. Inside, the fluorescent lights buzzed a monotonous drone, casting a sterile glow on rows of desks cluttered with paperwork, half-empty coffee cups, and the silent desperation of lives lived in spreadsheets. The year is 2018.

**Story Opening:**

The phone rang, a jarring shriek that ripped through the afternoon's monotonous quiet. **Beatrice Eleanor Kowalski**, perpetually perched on the edge of her worn-out swivel chair, sighed and stabbed the answer button with a vengeance.

"Kowalski Insurance, Beatrice speaking," she said, her voice a carefully constructed mask of professional cheerfulness, designed to both soothe potential clients and mask the overwhelming sense of existential dread that often threatened to engulf her. On days like this, when the sky pressed down like a leaden weight and the air crackled with the promise of snow, Beatrice found it increasingly difficult to maintain the facade. The Midwest in November was a cruel mistress, and Beatrice was starting to suspect she was one bad claim away from packing it all in and moving to a place where the sun shone more than three hours a day.

"Beatrice, darling! It's Dolores. Dolores Schmidt?"

Beatrice squeezed her eyes shut. Dolores Schmidt. Of course. The woman who called every Tuesday afternoon, without fail, to complain about the squirrel in her bird feeder and ask, for the twentieth time, if her homeowner's insurance covered "acts of God involving rodents and birdseed." Beatrice braced herself. This was going to be a long afternoon.
