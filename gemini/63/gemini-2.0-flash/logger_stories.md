Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a logger as the main character:

**Story Opening:**

The roar of the chainsaw ripped through the pre-dawn stillness like a wounded beast. Silas "Si" Harding gripped the vibrating machine, his knuckles white against the cold steel. The biting wind, already laced with the threat of winter, whipped around him, carrying the scent of pine and wet earth. Another day, another tree.  He spat a stream of brown tobacco juice into the snow and adjusted his wool cap, the worn fabric scratching against his forehead.  The sheer size of the Douglas fir before him still managed to impress him, even after twenty years of felling giants in these woods. This one, though, felt different. Older. Wiser. As if it held secrets he couldn't fathom. He knew it was just the fatigue setting in, the ache in his back a familiar companion. Still, a shiver, not entirely from the cold, ran down his spine. He tightened his grip, his calloused hands feeling for purchase, and prepared to make the first cut.

**Setting:**

The story is set in the rugged, heavily forested mountain region of the **Olympic Peninsula in Washington State**, in late **November**. The year is **1978**.

The specific logging site is on a steep, snow-dusted hillside overlooking a valley carved out by the Skokomish River. Towering Douglas fir, hemlock, and cedar trees dominate the landscape, their branches laden with snow.  A thin layer of ice covers the ground, making footing treacherous. The air is crisp and clean, with a hint of dampness that clings to everything.  The sounds of the forest – the creaking of branches, the distant rush of the river, and the occasional call of a raven – are amplified by the vastness of the wilderness. The nearest town, a small logging community called Hoodsport, is a few miles away, clinging to the edge of Hood Canal.
