Okay, here's a story opening and setting focusing on a plumber:

**Setting:**

The humid, mildew-scented basement of the old Victorian home at 13 Willow Creek Lane, nestled in the historic district of Savannah, Georgia. The air hung thick and heavy, tasting faintly of earth and something indefinably ancient. Exposed brick walls, once vibrant with color, were now stained and crumbling. Spiderwebs, thick as cotton candy, draped across the low-hanging pipes and ancient fuse boxes. The only light came from a bare, buzzing bulb hanging precariously from a single wire, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to writhe with a life of their own.

**Opening:**

The wrench slipped in his greasy hand, smacking with a dull thud against the rusty iron pipe. "Damn it," muttered Bartholomew "Bart" Quincey, wiping the sweat from his brow with the back of his equally greasy forearm. He readjusted his position, the cramped space forcing him to contort his body into a shape that felt vaguely illegal. The pipes in this old house were a labyrinthine nightmare, a testament to decades of shoddy repairs and questionable decisions by previous, less-than-competent plumbers. He cursed under his breath, the sound swallowed by the damp air. Mrs. Abernathy had called in a panic about a "flooding situation." He hadn't anticipated the situation to be a century-old disaster waiting to happen. This job was going to take more than just a wrench and a prayer. This job, Bart was starting to suspect, was going to take a miracle.
