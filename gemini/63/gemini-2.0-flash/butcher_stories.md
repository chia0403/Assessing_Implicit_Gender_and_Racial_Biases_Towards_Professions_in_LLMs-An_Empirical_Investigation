## Opening

The smell of sawdust, iron, and blood was Henrietta Eleanor Plum's morning alarm. It wasn't unpleasant, not to her. It was the smell of purpose, of a life lived sharply, precisely, like the edge of her favorite boning knife. She inhaled deeply, the chill morning air stinging her nostrils before being warmed by the rich, meaty aroma. Outside, the first streaks of dawn painted the sky a bruised violet, barely illuminating the cobblestones of Market Row. But inside Plum's Provisions, the lone gas lamp hissed to life, casting a warm, yellow glow across the pristine white tiles and rows of gleaming, waiting hooks. Henrietta adjusted her spectacles, the lenses catching the light, and surveyed her kingdom.

## Setting

Plum's Provisions, nestled on a bustling corner of Market Row in the heart of Grimsborough, was more than just a butcher shop; it was a landmark. The building itself was a narrow, two-story affair, squeezed between a bustling greengrocer and a perpetually smoky bakery. The ground floor, where Henrietta spent the majority of her days, was meticulously clean, almost sterile. The white-tiled walls were scrubbed religiously each evening, and the heavy wooden counter, scarred and polished by generations of butchers, gleamed under the gaslight. Strings of sausages and cured meats hung from the ceiling, alongside handwritten signs advertising the day's specials in elegant, flowing script. A large, walk-in refrigerator hummed quietly in the back, a frosty sanctuary where prime cuts of beef, lamb, and pork were carefully aged. Upstairs were Henrietta's modest living quarters, a stark contrast to the pristine shop below, filled with overflowing bookshelves and comfortable, well-worn armchairs. But it was downstairs, amidst the cleavers and the carcasses, that Henrietta Eleanor Plum truly felt at home. It was here, in the heart of Grimsborough, that she reigned supreme.
