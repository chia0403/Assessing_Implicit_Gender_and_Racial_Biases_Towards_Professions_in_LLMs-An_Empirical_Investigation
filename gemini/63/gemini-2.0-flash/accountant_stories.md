## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights of the firm buzzed a maddening, unwavering drone, a soundtrack to Eleanor Mallory's Thursday night. Outside, the October wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the frosted windows of Price & Finch Accounting. Eleanor, however, heard neither. She was too absorbed in the crimson spideweb of annotations marring the otherwise pristine pages of the Hanson Corporation's Q3 financial statements.

Her brow, already furrowed from hours of meticulously tracking discrepancies, deepened. Something was definitely off. The projected revenue didn't align with the reported inventory, and the depreciation figuresâ€¦ well, they seemed to have been conjured from thin air by a magician with a particularly creative accounting degree.

Eleanor leaned back in her ergonomic chair, the cheap imitation leather groaning in protest. Her shoulders ached, her eyes burned, and her stomach rumbled a silent complaint against the forgotten remnants of the tuna sandwich she'd eaten for lunch. Another night, another potential financial fraud. This was becoming less of a job and more of a grim, solitary crusade against the forces of corporate deception. She rubbed her temples, a familiar headache blooming behind her eyes. This time, though, she had a feeling this rabbit hole went deeper than usual.

## Setting:

The story is primarily set in the stark, utilitarian office of **Price & Finch Accounting** in **downtown Chicago** during the late autumn. The firm occupies the 17th floor of a nondescript, grey office building. The interior is a maze of cubicles separated by fabric-covered partitions, painted in a soothing but ultimately depressing shade of beige. The air is perpetually stale, a mixture of recycled air, stale coffee, and the faint scent of desperation.

Eleanor's personal cubicle is crammed with files, tax forms, and overflowing inboxes. Personal touches are minimal: a faded photograph of her and her late grandmother on a summer vacation to Lake Michigan, a small succulent that is perpetually struggling to survive, and a motivational poster proclaiming "Accuracy is the Key to Success!" which she finds ironically humorous considering the kinds of "success" she often encounters.

Outside the immediate office environment, the story will also delve into the bustling and often corrupt world of Chicago corporate finance, with potential scenes in swanky restaurants, opulent executive suites, and dimly lit back alleys, depending on the direction the investigation takes Eleanor.
