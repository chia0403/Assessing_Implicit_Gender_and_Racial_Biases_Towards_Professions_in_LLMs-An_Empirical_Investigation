The chipped mug warmed Ms. Eleanor Josephine Ainsworth's hands, a small comfort against the arctic blast emanating from the old windowpanes of her classroom. It was 6:00 AM, the hour of ghosts and forgotten lesson plans, and the pre-dawn gloom painted the empty desks in shades of gray. Northwood High, nestled deep in the heart of Minnesota, wasn't exactly a place that exuded sunshine even at noon, but this early in January, it felt particularly bleak. Snow, piled high outside, muffled the already sparse sounds of the awakening town. Eleanor sighed, the condensation fogging her glasses as she stared out at the snow-covered football field, remembering when the cheers of the student body used to fill the air, instead of the deafening silence. Today, she had to inspire that same energy, not to win a game, but to dissect the complexities of "The Great Gatsby" for a room full of teenagers who probably considered TikTok the greatest tragedy of the modern era.
