## Story Opening:

The steam from the facial steamer swirled around Seraphina Lucia Moretti's face, a welcome, humid embrace against the crisp January air that always seemed to seep into the salon. She closed her eyes, inhaling the faint scent of chamomile and lavender, trying to find a pocket of calm before the storm arrived. It was Friday, which meant the meticulously organized sanctuary of Seraphina's Studio, usually a haven of soft lighting and hushed tones, would soon be a battlefield of chipped nail polish, frantic brides, and the ever-present drone of gossip.

Seraphina sighed, rubbing the bridge of her nose with a knuckle. She loved her job, she really did. Witnessing the transformation, the blossoming of confidence in a woman who just needed a little boost, was a daily joy. But today felt different. A knot of unease had settled in her stomach, a premonition she couldn't quite shake off. Maybe it was the unusually persistent grayness of the sky outside. Maybe it was the way Mrs. Abernathy, a client who swore by the rejuvenating power of bee venom facials, had muttered something about "omens" during her appointment earlier that morning. Or maybe, just maybe, it was the unsettling phone call she'd received the day before, a whispered voice on the other end that had vanished before she could even speak.

## Setting:

**Seraphina's Studio** is nestled on the bustling main street of the small, historic town of Bellbridge, Connecticut. The building itself is a charming Victorian house, painted a soft dove gray with crisp white trim. Seraphina painstakingly renovated the space, transforming it into a modern, inviting salon while retaining the building's original character.

Inside, the d√©cor is a blend of vintage charm and contemporary chic. Antique mirrors hang on the walls, reflecting the soft glow of strategically placed Edison bulbs. Plush velvet seating in shades of blush pink and emerald green creates a welcoming atmosphere. Each station is meticulously organized, boasting high-end products and state-of-the-art equipment. A small, cozy waiting area features a fireplace and shelves lined with beauty magazines and curated books.

The scent of essential oils and freshly brewed herbal tea permeates the air, creating a sense of tranquility that belies the frenetic pace of Seraphina's day. Large windows look out onto the bustling street, offering a glimpse of the town's quaint shops and the constant flow of passersby. In the back, a private treatment room offers a more secluded setting for facials, waxing, and other specialized services. Overall, Seraphina's Studio is a haven of beauty and relaxation, a place where women can escape the stresses of everyday life and emerge feeling refreshed, rejuvenated, and ready to face the world.
