## Story Opening:

The stench of boiled cabbage and damp wool clung to the air, a familiar perfume for Guardsman Alistair Thorne. He shifted his weight, the leather of his breastplate creaking a weary protest, and squinted at the throng pushing through the East Gate of Oakhaven. Merchants hawked their wares, their voices a discordant symphony of promises and bargains. Farmers, their faces weathered like ancient stone, jostled alongside nobles draped in silks that shimmered even in the overcast morning light. Alistair had seen it all before, a constant, swirling tide of humanity flowing into and out of the city.

He suppressed a yawn. Another day, another headache waiting to happen. The only excitement he'd encountered in his twelve years on the wall was the occasional runaway pig or the unfortunate pickpocket who thought he could outsmart the city guard. Today, he suspected, would be no different.
## Setting:

The story opens at the **East Gate of Oakhaven, a bustling city nestled in the fertile valley of the River Eldwyn.** The gate itself is a formidable structure of grey stone, reinforced with iron and flanked by two watchtowers that loom over the surrounding countryside. Oakhaven is a hub of trade and agriculture, drawing people from all walks of life.

Beyond the gate lies a cobblestone road, lined with stalls overflowing with produce, textiles, and various goods. The air is thick with the smells of cooking food, horse dung, and unwashed bodies. The architecture is a mix of sturdy, practical buildings made of brick and timber and more elaborate structures boasting decorative carvings and painted facades. In the distance, the towering spire of the Grand Cathedral pierces the sky, a symbol of the city's wealth and power.

The valley itself is lush and green, dotted with fields of wheat and barley. The River Eldwyn meanders through the landscape, providing a vital source of water and transportation. The surrounding hills are covered in dense forests, rumored to be home to wild animals and forgotten ruins.
