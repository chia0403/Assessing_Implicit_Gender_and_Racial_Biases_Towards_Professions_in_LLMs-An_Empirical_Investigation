The flickering fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous drone, a soundtrack to life’s forgotten corners. Dust motes danced in the weak beams, pirouetting across the floor of the Grand Majestic Theatre, a relic of a bygone era clinging stubbornly to its faded grandeur. The velvet curtains, once a vibrant crimson, now hung heavy and threadbare, stained with the ghosts of spilled champagne and forgotten dreams. A lone spotlight, angled precariously from the balcony, cast long, skeletal shadows across the empty stage.

Here, in the hushed silence between performances, lived the second shift. Here, amid the echoes of applause and the scent of stale popcorn, lived **Silas Bartholomew Pruitt**, janitor. He wasn't just *a* janitor, mind you, he was *the* janitor. He was the man who knew every squeak in the floorboards, every cobweb clinging to the rafters, every discarded playbill crumpled beneath the seats. He was the guardian of the theatre's forgotten secrets, the silent witness to its slow, inevitable decline. He stood now, a stooped figure in a faded blue uniform, pushing his battered mop bucket across the stage, the rhythmic swish and squeak of the mop the only sound besides the hum of the lights. He wasn’t just cleaning; he was preserving. He was holding onto the last vestiges of magic in a place where the curtain was slowly falling. And tonight, Silas had a feeling, something was different. The air was thick with anticipation, like a pre-show tension that lingered long after the audience had gone home.
