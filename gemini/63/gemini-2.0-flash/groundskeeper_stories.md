Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a groundskeeper named...

**Story Opening:**

The morning mist clung to the manicured lawns of Oakhaven Cemetery like a shroud, blurring the already faded inscriptions on the weathered headstones. Silas Abernathy, Grounds Keeper, squinted against the damp, his breath puffing out in small, white clouds. He gripped the handle of his well-worn spade, the familiar weight a comfort in the unsettling silence. He wasn't usually nervous, not after twenty years of tending to the dearly departed, but something felt different this morning. The crows hadn't cawed at sunrise, the squirrels hadn't chattered their usual territorial disputes, and even the wind seemed to hold its breath. It was a stillness that pressed down on Silas, heavy and unnatural. And then, he saw it. A single, blood-red rose, laid perfectly centered on the freshly turned earth of an unmarked grave in the perpetually shaded 'Rose Garden' section of the cemetery. It hadn't been there yesterday. And Silas was absolutely, unequivocally, sure that no one had been granted permission to bury anyone there.

**Setting:**

Oakhaven Cemetery. It sprawls over fifty acres of gently rolling hills just outside the small, quiet town of Havenwood, nestled deep in the Appalachian Mountains. The cemetery is divided into several distinct sections:

*   **The Old Section:** The original grounds, filled with crumbling Victorian-era monuments, weeping angels with moss-covered wings, and family crypts that have stood for generations. This section is overgrown and romantic, a testament to a bygone era.

*   **The Rose Garden:** A smaller, more modern section, notable for its carefully cultivated rose bushes and simple, often unmarked, graves. It's known for its perpetual shade, cast by a thick canopy of ancient oak trees.

*   **The Veteran's Section:** Row upon row of identical, white headstones, honoring those who served their country. A somber and respectful space.

*   **The Mausoleum:** A grand, marble structure, housing the remains of the town's wealthiest families. Ornate and imposing.

*   **The Grounds Keeper's Cottage:** A small, stone cottage located near the main entrance. Silas lives here year-round, ensuring the grounds are kept immaculate. It's cozy and cluttered, filled with well-worn books, gardening tools, and the scent of earth and dried flowers.

Oakhaven is a place of both beauty and sadness, a testament to the cycle of life and death. It's a place where the past lingers, and the secrets of the dead are carefully guarded by the living.
