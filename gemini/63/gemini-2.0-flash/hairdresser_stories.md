## Story Opening:

The buzzing of Mrs. Featherstonehaugh's hearing aid, usually drowned out by the relentless chatter of Salon Seraphina, pierced through the relative calm like a rogue bee. "Darling, are you even listening?" she boomed, her voice a gravelly foghorn honed from decades of disapproving tea parties and garden club meetings.

Seraphina Dubois plastered on a smile, the kind she’d perfected for dealing with demanding clients since she was sixteen and sweeping up clippings. "Of course, Mrs. Featherstonehaugh. You were saying…?"

Mrs. Featherstonehaugh jabbed a bony finger at her reflection. "This *thing*. This… poodle fright wig! It's not the 'softly sculpted waterfall of silver' I requested. It's an architectural catastrophe! It looks like I've been electrocuted by Liberace!"

Seraphina sighed internally. It was Tuesday, and Tuesday was always a test of her patience. She took a deep breath, the scent of perm solution and ambition clinging to the air, and reminded herself that Mrs. Featherstonehaugh's weekly appointment was a small price to pay for the freedom to pursue her real dream: winning the prestigious Golden Comb award at the National Hairdressing Convention in Vegas.

## Setting:

**Salon Seraphina** was a kaleidoscope of colour and controlled chaos, nestled on a quiet side street in the bustling, artsy district of **Asheville, North Carolina**. Sunlight streamed through the large, plate-glass windows, illuminating swirling dust motes and the vibrant, slightly faded tapestry hanging behind the reception desk. The walls were painted a warm, inviting coral, a stark contrast to the industrial chic aesthetic that dominated most of the surrounding businesses. Six antique barber chairs, salvaged from various estate sales and lovingly restored, faced large, well-lit mirrors.

Shelves overflowed with a dizzying array of styling products: shimmering sprays in pearlescent bottles, tubs of brightly coloured waxes, and rows of shimmering, multi-hued hair dyes that promised everything from "Mystic Merlot" to "Electric Tangerine." The air hummed with the low thrum of hairdryers, snippets of conversations about everything from local gossip to the latest art exhibit, and the ever-present, surprisingly soothing, rhythmic snip-snip-snipping of scissors.

Outside, the cobblestone street buzzed with a different kind of energy: the clatter of tourists browsing the quirky boutiques, the rhythmic strumming of a street musician serenading passersby with a melancholic tune, and the general, vibrant pulse of a city that embraced both its bohemian spirit and its growing popularity. Salon Seraphina was an oasis of calm amidst the vibrant chaos, a place where people came to transform, to be pampered, and, if Seraphina Dubois had anything to do with it, to leave feeling just a little bit more beautiful than they arrived.
