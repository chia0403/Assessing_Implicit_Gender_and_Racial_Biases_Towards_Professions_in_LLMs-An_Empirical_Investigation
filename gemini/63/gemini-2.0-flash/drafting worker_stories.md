Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a story featuring a drafting worker:

**Story Opening:**

The rhythmic scratching of lead against vellum was the only sound in the cavernous drafting room that actually soothed Clara Elizabeth Ainsworth. It was a sound sheâ€™d come to rely on, a counterpoint to the incessant clamor in her own head. Today, however, even that familiar sound couldn't quite drown out the anxieties bubbling within her. The deadline loomed, like a shadowy skyscraper against the fading afternoon light creeping in through the grimy, arched windows of the old building. She took a deep breath, the metallic tang of ink and the musty scent of aged paper filling her lungs. If she didn't finish the detailed schematics for the cantilevered roof supports on the new opera house soon, Mr. Harding, the head architect, would have her hide nailed to the mahogany drawing table. And that was, Clara knew, not an exaggeration.

**Setting:**

The story is primarily set in the drafting room of Harding & Sons Architects, a well-established but somewhat antiquated architectural firm in *New Orleans, Louisiana* in the year *1928*.

*   **The Room:** The drafting room itself is a large, high-ceilinged space in a Beaux-Arts style building located in the heart of the city's business district. Rows of large, adjustable drafting tables dominate the space, each littered with vellum blueprints, technical drawing instruments, and overflowing ashtrays (smoking is, of course, rampant). Sunlight streams in through large, arched windows, but is often filtered by the perpetually dusty glass. The walls are lined with shelves filled with rolled blueprints, architectural books, and models of past projects, lending the room an air of both industriousness and slight disarray.
*   **Atmosphere:** The atmosphere is one of focused, sometimes frenzied, activity. The air is thick with the scent of ink, paper, and cigarette smoke. There's a constant buzz of conversation, punctuated by the clatter of instruments and the rustle of blueprints. Tension is often palpable, especially as deadlines approach.
*   **Outside:** The building's location in New Orleans provides a backdrop of both historical charm and simmering social tensions. The city is a melting pot of cultures, and the architecture reflects this: a vibrant mix of French, Spanish, and American influences. However, beneath the surface beauty, the city is also grappling with issues of race, class, and changing times. The rise of jazz music, flapper culture, and new technologies are all challenging the established order.
