## Story Opening:

The scent of jasmine and old money hung heavy in the air of the Grand Palais Hôtel, a perfume perfected over a century of discreet entrances and whispered indiscretions. Outside, Paris shimmered, a city of lights and dreams. Inside, everything was hushed, expectant. It was a theatre, and tonight, the curtain was about to rise on a drama not even the most seasoned playwright could have conceived.

Amelia Claire Dubois, her name as classic and refined as the hotel itself, straightened the silk ascot that adorned her crisp white blouse. At forty-three, with eyes the colour of the Seine on a stormy day and an air of composed competence, she was the Grand Palais's head concierge, a linchpin in its intricate, gilded machinery. She’d seen everything within these walls: illicit affairs, extravagant displays of wealth, broken hearts, and triumphs celebrated with champagne that flowed like the river itself. Tonight, however, there was a different kind of tension simmering beneath the surface, a prickling unease that raised the hairs on the back of her neck. The arrival of Madame Valois, infamous widow of the recently deceased shipping magnate, Jean-Luc Valois, had certainly amplified it. But even before Madame Valois’s motorcade had swept into the courtyard, Amelia had felt it, a discordant note in the otherwise harmonious symphony of the Grand Palais.

Tonight, something was wrong. And Amelia Claire Dubois knew, with a certainty that settled deep in her bones, that she was about to be caught in the middle of it.
