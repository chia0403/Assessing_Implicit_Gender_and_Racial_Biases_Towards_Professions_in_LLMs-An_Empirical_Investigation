## Story Opening:

The flickering neon sign of "Globetrotter Getaways" cast a sickly yellow glow across Eleanor Mallory's face as she stared out the rain-streaked window. Another Tuesday night, another empty office. The only sound was the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of her pen against the worn surface of her mahogany desk, a soundtrack to her slowly dwindling dreams. Eleanor, a woman whoâ€™d once envisioned herself jet-setting to exotic locales on someone else's dime, was instead, more often than not, arranging budget cruises to the Bahamas for retirees named Mildred. Tonight, however, even Mildred seemed to be avoiding her.

A particularly vicious gust of wind rattled the glass, momentarily obscuring the faded posters of turquoise beaches and ancient ruins that lined the walls. Eleanor sighed. This was supposed to be her year. The year she broke free from the humdrum routine, the year she finally used her expert knowledge to craft her own adventure. But the only adventure she seemed destined for was one of paperwork and dwindling commission checks.

## Setting:

The Globetrotter Getaways office was nestled in a forgotten corner of downtown Willow Creek, Ohio, between a pawn shop that smelled faintly of stale cigarettes and a taxidermist with an unnerving collection of glassy-eyed squirrels. The interior was a testament to a bygone era of travel glamour: plush, velvet chairs (slightly threadbare in places), a world globe that predated the fall of the Berlin Wall, and brochures for destinations that now felt like relics of a more optimistic time. The air hung heavy with the scent of old paper and potpourri, a cloying sweetness that did little to mask the general air of stagnation. Eleanor's desk was a meticulously organized chaos of maps, travel guides, and sticky notes overflowing with phone numbers and scribbled reminders. The only personal touch was a framed photograph of her backpacking through Southeast Asia years ago, a vibrant reminder of a life that felt increasingly distant.
