Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a florist named Eleanor Beatrice Hawthorne:

**Opening:**

The scent of damp earth and dying roses clung to Eleanor Beatrice Hawthorne like a second skin. She barely noticed it anymore, not after twenty years of running "Hawthorne & Petal," the little flower shop tucked between Mrs. Peabody's perpetually closed antique store and Mr. Fillmore's perpetually crowded bakery. This morning, however, the usual earthy fragrance was overpowered by something else entirely: the acrid sting of smoke. Eleanor wrinkled her nose, peering over a half-finished arrangement of lilies towards the street. A wisp of grey drifted past the window, carrying with it the faint, unsettling whisper of burning paper. *Something* was definitely amiss, and Eleanor Beatrice Hawthorne, purveyor of beauty and secrets in equal measure, had a distinct feeling it involved more than just a clumsy customer with a rogue cigarette.

**Setting:**

The story is set in the quaint, somewhat faded, seaside town of Port Blossom, Maine. Port Blossom is a place where the fishing industry is slowly giving way to tourism, but still holds onto its salty, weathered charm. Think clapboard houses painted in muted blues and greens, lobster traps stacked haphazardly near the docks, and the constant cry of seagulls overhead.

"Hawthorne & Petal" is located on Main Street, a cobblestone lane lined with small, independently owned shops. The shop itself is small and overflowing with life. Buckets of flowers in every color imaginable crowd the floor, overflowing onto shelves. The air is thick with the perfume of roses, lilies, and hyacinths. Vintage flower presses hang on the walls, alongside framed botanical prints. Eleanor's workspace is a sturdy, worn wooden table piled high with ribbons, floral wire, and snippets of greenery. The overall effect is charming, slightly chaotic, and undeniably welcoming - a haven of natural beauty amidst the sometimes-dreary reality of a small coastal town struggling to stay afloat. Behind the main shop area is a small, cluttered back room where Eleanor stores her supplies and occasionally sneaks a cup of tea.

Let me know if you'd like me to continue the story or tweak the setting or opening in any way!
