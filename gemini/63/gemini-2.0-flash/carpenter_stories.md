The smell of pine, aged cedar, and sawdust hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Elijah James Thorne. Sunlight streamed through the grimy windows of his workshop, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the golden rays like tiny, restless spirits. Outside, the sleepy town of Havenwood, nestled deep in the Appalachian Mountains, was just beginning to stir. The rumble of Mr. Henderson's milk truck, making its early morning rounds, barely penetrated the thick walls of Elijah's workshop, a deliberate insulation he'd built himself, years ago, seeking solace and focus in the rhythmic whine of his saw.

Elijah hadn't slept well. He'd been haunted again by the same recurring dream: splintered wood, a gaping hole, and the sound of a mournful wind whistling through it. He wasn't a superstitious man, but the dream always left him feelingâ€¦uneasy. He ran a calloused hand over the grain of a piece of walnut, the smooth, dark surface grounding him in the present. Today was the day he was to deliver the coffin he'd been commissioned to build for old Mrs. Willowbrook. It was a simple design, as requested, but Elijah had put his heart into it, choosing the finest wood and ensuring every joint was perfect. He hoped it would bring some small comfort to her grieving family.
