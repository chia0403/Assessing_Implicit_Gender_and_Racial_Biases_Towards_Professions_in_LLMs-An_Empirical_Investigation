The relentless beep of the cardiac monitor cut through the pre-dawn gloom of the Intensive Care Unit like a rusty saw. Amelia Jane Davies, OT/L, CTRS, sighed, the sound barely audible above the mechanical symphony of life support. She ran a hand through her already messy bun, the stray wisps of brown hair catching the faint, sickly green light filtering from the hallway.

The setting was the sprawling University Medical Center, a concrete and glass behemoth that dominated the skyline of downtown Minneapolis. On this particular floor, the ICU, time seemed to warp and blur. Day and night held little meaning, dictated only by the changing shifts of nurses and the relentless rhythm of the machines. The air was thick with the antiseptic tang of cleaning solutions and the faint, underlying scent of fear and hope, a constant reminder of the fragile lives hanging in the balance. Amelia, in her practical but uninspired teal scrubs, often felt like she was walking through a dream, or perhaps a nightmare, depending on the patient she was about to see. Today, it was Mr. Henderson, post-stroke, and the beep of his heart was a maddening, insistent reminder of the long road ahead.
