The harsh fluorescent lights of the office hummed a monotonous symphony, a soundtrack to Beatrice Eleanor Ainsworthâ€™s misery. At 8:57 AM, precisely three minutes before her boss, Mr. Harding, thundered in with the ferocity of a disgruntled rhino, Beatrice meticulously arranged the pens on his desk. Blue on the left, black on the right, all pointing in the same direction, their caps clicked on with a satisfying, quiet finality. It was a small act of order in the chaos of her day, a ritual she clung to like a life raft in a sea of paperwork and petty demands.

The setting was the perpetually beige-toned office of Harding & Sons, a family-owned import/export company nestled on the 17th floor of the Griffin Building, downtown Chicago. From her desk, a cramped space wedged between the copier and the break room, Beatrice had a sliver of a view of Lake Michigan, usually obscured by the grime-coated window. The air always smelled faintly of burnt coffee and desperation, a testament to the long hours and even longer tempers that brewed within these walls. Today, however, the air held a slightly different scent: a floral perfume, cloyingly sweet, that Beatrice knew could only mean one thing: another visit from Mr. Harding's overbearing wife, Priscilla. This was going to be a long day.
