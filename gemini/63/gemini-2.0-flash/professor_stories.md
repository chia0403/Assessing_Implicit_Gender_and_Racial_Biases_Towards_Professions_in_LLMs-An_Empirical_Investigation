**Setting:** The hushed, wood-paneled library of the Athenaeum Club in London. Rain lashed against the tall, gothic windows, blurring the gaslight into flickering halos. The scent of old leather, beeswax polish, and damp wool permeated the air. Rows upon rows of leather-bound books stretched towards the high, ornately plastered ceiling, their titles glinting faintly in the dim light. A crackling fire struggled against the encroaching chill in the massive marble fireplace.

**Opening:**

Professor Eleanor Ainsworth, Ph.D., FRHistS, shivered, pulling her tweed shawl tighter around her. The chill, she suspected, was less from the unseasonably cold October evening and more from the unsettling letter clutched in her gloved hand. The spidery, elegant script, so familiar yet so deeply disturbing, hinted at a mystery buried for decades - a mystery she had vowed to leave undisturbed. The Athenaeum, usually a sanctuary of intellectual calm, now felt oppressive, its weight of history pressing down on her like the very dust-laden tomes that lined its shelves. She smoothed the wrinkled parchment, the firelight dancing across the chilling words: *“The secrets you sought to bury are stirring, Eleanor. Come to Blackwood Manor. He remembers.”*
