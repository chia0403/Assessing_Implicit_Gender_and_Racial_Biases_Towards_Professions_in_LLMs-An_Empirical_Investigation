Okay, here's a story opening with a setting and a main character who is a judge:

**Opening:**

The gavel slammed down, the sound echoing in the cavernous courtroom like a thunderclap. Judge Eleanor Vance, a woman whose steely gaze could freeze hell over, adjusted her spectacles and surveyed the defendant with an almost palpable weariness. It wasn't the case itself, a rather mundane corporate embezzlement, that weighed on her. It was the feeling, gnawing at the edge of her consciousness, that something was profoundly wrong. The air in the courtroom, usually thick with legal jargon and hushed whispers, felt…different.  Charged.  Like a static electricity before a storm. She took a deep breath, trying to focus on the presenter's closing statement, but her eyes kept drifting to the ornate carvings above the judge's bench.  They seemed to be…shifting.

**Setting:**

The story is set in the **Kingswood County Courthouse** in the fictional town of **Havenwood, Massachusetts**. Havenwood is a picturesque, historic town nestled in the Berkshire Mountains, known for its charming bed and breakfasts, antique shops, and, more recently, a string of unexplained disappearances that have the local police baffled. The Kingswood County Courthouse is a stately, Neo-Gothic building constructed in the late 19th century. Its exterior is imposing, made of dark grey stone, with gargoyles perched on the roof, overlooking the town square. Inside, the courtroom itself is a grand, high-ceilinged space, adorned with mahogany paneling, stained-glass windows depicting scenes of justice, and portraits of past judges. The air inside is often cool and damp, carrying the scent of old books and dust.
