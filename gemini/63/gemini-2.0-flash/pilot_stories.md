The biting wind whipped at Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne's worn leather flying jacket as she preflighted her beloved Stinson Reliant, "The Peregrine." The high-altitude sun, stark and unforgiving, painted the snow-dusted peaks of the Wrangell-St. Elias National Park in hues of rose and lavender. This was her office; the endless Alaskan sky.

She inhaled deeply, the crisp air filling her lungs with the scent of pine and aviation fuel. Chatter marks on her hand-held radio told of a storm brewing down south, near Anchorage, but up here, nestled in the shadow of Mount Blackburn, the air was still pristine. Amelia was a bush pilot, one of the last of a dying breed. She hauled supplies, transported prospectors, and occasionally, when the authorities called, assisted in search and rescue operations.

Today's flight was a simple supply run to the remote village of Nabesna, a cluster of log cabins clinging to the edge of the Chisana River. But in Alaska, "simple" was a relative term. Anything could happen out here, and Amelia knew it. She patted the fuselage of The Peregrine, a gesture that was part reverence, part habit. In this vast wilderness, her plane wasn't just a machine; it was her lifeline. She flipped the switch on the engine, and the familiar roar filled the mountain air, swallowing the silence whole. Another day above the clouds was about to begin.
