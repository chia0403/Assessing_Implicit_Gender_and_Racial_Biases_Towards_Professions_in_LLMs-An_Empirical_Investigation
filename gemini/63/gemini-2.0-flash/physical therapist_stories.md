## The Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** A biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, swirling snow against the frosted windows of the "Restore & Renew Physical Therapy Clinic" in a revitalized, but still gritty, neighborhood of Milwaukee. Inside, the fluorescent lights hummed a relentless tune above the clatter of weights and the groan of straining muscles. The air smelled of disinfectant, sweat, and the lingering scent of Brenda's lavender-scented hand sanitizer.

**Opening:**

Amelia Grace Kowalski, DPT, braced herself against the cool metal of the parallel bars and offered a strained smile to Mrs. Petrowski, a woman whose arthritis had sculpted her hands into gnarled branches. "Just a little further, Mrs. Petrowski. You're doing fantastic. Feel that burn in your biceps? That's good! That's what we want."

Mrs. Petrowski, her face flushed with effort, only managed a pained grimace in response. Amelia knew the woman was pushing herself, fueled by a stubborn hope that she might one day hold her grandson again without wincing. That hope, Amelia had learned, was a potent medicine, often more effective than any ultrasound or electrical stimulation she could offer.

Suddenly, the bell above the clinic door jangled, a jarring sound that cut through the quiet hum. Amelia glanced up, expecting another cancellation notification from the blizzarding weather. Instead, a figure stood framed in the doorway, shaking snow from a threadbare coat. He was tall, impossibly so, with a haunted look in his eyes and a cane that looked almost as weary as he did. Something about him, a deep-seated weariness that radiated outwards, snagged Amelia's attention and left her feeling an inexplicable sense ofâ€¦ dread.
