The aroma of stale potpourri and lingering lemon cleaner clung to the air in the McMansion like a desperate perfume. Brenda Sue McMillan, a woman whose own home decorating aesthetic leaned more towards "grandma chic with a hint of leopard print," suppressed a gag. It was her fifth showing of the day, and each one felt like a slow, agonizing death by beige.

Brenda Sue adjusted the lapel of her perfectly pressed crimson blazer, a pop of color she considered her "closing deal" accessory. She’d learned long ago that in the cutthroat world of Dallas real estate, a little bit of audacity went a long way.

She stood on the manicured lawn, the kind that required more water than the entire continent of Africa, and squinted at the monstrosity before her. It was located in the prestigious Preston Hollow neighborhood, a district known for its sprawling estates, its high-net-worth residents, and its crippling HOA fees. This particular house, dubbed "Tara's Retreat" by the previous owner, was a six-bedroom, seven-bathroom testament to excess. The Grecian columns flanking the double front doors looked particularly absurd against the backdrop of the Texas landscape.

Brenda Sue sighed. Selling Tara's Retreat wouldn't be a piece of pecan pie. The previous owners had left it in a state that could charitably be described as "lived-in." More accurately, it was a biohazard waiting to happen. She’d already dealt with the lingering scent of Mr. Snuggles, the deceased Persian cat (gone but not forgotten, apparently), and a suspicious stain on the master bedroom carpet that she dared not investigate too closely.

But Brenda Sue McMillan wasn't one to back down from a challenge. She'd sold houses that were falling apart, houses with resident ghosts (allegedly), and even a house that had been used as a meth lab (much to the horror of the new owners, but hey, disclosure was key!). She was Brenda Sue McMillan, damn it, and she would sell this godforsaken Grecian monstrosity, even if it killed her.
