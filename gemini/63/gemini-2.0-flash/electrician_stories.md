## The Hum

The air in the old Victorian mansion, even with the summer heat beating down outside, felt perpetually damp and cold. A shiver snaked down Evelyn Maeve Carter's spine, despite the thin film of sweat clinging to her forehead. She adjusted her tool belt, the familiar weight a comforting counterpoint to the unsettling atmosphere.

Evelyn was standing in the grand foyer, its once-opulent wallpaper peeling away in baroque swirls, revealing layers of faded floral patterns underneath. Dust motes danced in the shafts of sunlight that pierced through the grimy stained-glass windows, illuminating the vast emptiness of the room. The only sound, apart from the chirping crickets outside, was the faint, persistent *hum* emanating from somewhere deep within the house.

Evelyn Maeve Carter, a seasoned electrician with calloused hands and a sharp eye, wasn't easily spooked. She'd wired up everything from leaky trailers to cutting-edge solar farms, facing down angry homeowners, rogue raccoons, and enough faulty wiring to fill a small town. But there was something about this place, Blackwood Manor, that prickled her senses. The air felt heavy, expectant. And that infernal *hum*…

She double-checked her tools – voltage tester, wire strippers, pliers, a roll of electrical tape – all neatly organized and ready to go. Mr. Blackwood, the eccentric, reclusive owner, had been adamant on the phone: "The lights flicker, Ms. Carter. And that blasted hum! It's been driving me mad for weeks!"

Evelyn sighed, pulling her braided brown hair back from her face. "Alright, Blackwood," she muttered to the silent foyer. "Let's see what horrors you've got lurking in your fuse box."

With a deep breath, Evelyn Maeve Carter started her trek deeper into the shadowy heart of Blackwood Manor, the hum growing steadily louder with each step. The adventure had only just begun.
