The midday sun beat down on the meticulously manicured lawns of Blackwood Manor, shimmering off the freshly mown emerald blades.  Dust motes danced in the air, creating a hazy halo around the ornate wrought-iron gates.  Elias Thorne, landscaper extraordinaire, wiped the sweat from his brow with the back of his hand, a practiced movement that spoke volumes of years spent under the relentless English summer sun.  He adjusted the leather strap of his gardening shears, the familiar weight a comfort against the rising tension in his shoulders.  This job, this pristine perfection, was supposed to be a balm, a refuge from the turmoil that had plagued him for months.  Instead, Blackwood Manor felt more like a cage, its meticulously crafted beauty a cruel mockery of his own fractured inner landscape.

The manor itself stood as a testament to opulent decadence.  Grey stone, weathered yet imposing, rose high into the sky, its windows reflecting the harsh glare like cold, unblinking eyes.  Formal hedges, clipped into perfect geometric shapes, bordered the long, winding drive, a stark contrast to the riotous wildness Elias craved.  Everywhere, the whispers of meticulous planning, of rigid control, hung heavy in the air.  Elias felt a shiver of unease, a prickly sensation of being watched, even though the only other presence was the meticulously groomed topiary of a snarling dragon that guarded the entrance to the property.
