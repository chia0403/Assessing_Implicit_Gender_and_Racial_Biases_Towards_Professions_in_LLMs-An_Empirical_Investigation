The biting wind whipped Amelia "Ellie" Blackwood's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks like a thousand tiny needles.  She adjusted the strap of her worn leather satchel, the weight of her meticulously curated notes a familiar comfort against the chill.  The cobblestones beneath her boots, slick with a mixture of rain and frost, echoed the restless rhythm of her own heartbeat.  She stood at the precipice of the Whispering Cliffs, the grey granite rising like an angry tooth against the bruised twilight sky.  This was the final stop on the "Legends of the Lost Valley" tour, and, despite the weather, a hush fell over the small group of tourists huddled around her.  Their murmurs, whispers of awe and apprehension, mingled with the mournful howl of the wind, a symphony of anticipation.  Ellie, with her decades of experience guiding lost souls (both literally and figuratively) through this desolate, yet captivating valley, knew this was more than a simple sightseeing trip.  This was an experience.  This was a story, waiting to be told.


**Setting:** The Whispering Cliffs, a jagged, wind-swept promontory overlooking a valley steeped in legend and myth.  The valley itself is a tapestry of ancient forests, hidden glens, and crumbling ruins, shrouded in an almost perpetual mist, giving it a sense of mystery and isolation.  It is a place where the past seems to cling to the present, whispering secrets in the wind.
