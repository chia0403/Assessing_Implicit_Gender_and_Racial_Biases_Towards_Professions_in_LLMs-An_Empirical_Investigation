Aeridor, the City of Whispers, was a place where secrets clung to the stone buildings like damp moss, and fear was a constant companion.  Elara, a guard of the Palatine Precinct, felt the weight of it all pressing down on her.  Her uniform, a dark, practical grey, felt stiff against her skin, mirroring the inflexible rules and expectations that defined her life.  She clutched the worn leather strap of her sword, its cool metal a small comfort in the icy air.  The scent of stale bread and burnt offerings, a constant feature of the city's aroma, hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the bitter chill.  Ahead, the archway to the Quarter of Lost Souls loomed, a gaping maw of shadowed darkness, promising untold mysteries and lurking dangers.  Tonight, Elara was determined to silence the whispers that echoed within it.
