The biting wind, a razor-edged whisper against Silas Blackwood's exposed cheeks, whipped snow into stinging flurries across the jagged peaks of the Cascade Mountains.  Sunlight, a pale ghost, barely pierced the swirling white chaos, casting long, skeletal shadows that danced around the towering pines.  Silas, his calloused hands wrapped tight around the worn leather grip of his axe, hauled the heavy timber down the slope.  The air, thin and frigid, bit at his lungs, each breath a short, ragged gasp.  He was alone, as he always was, save for the relentless rhythm of the axe and the mournful cry of unseen birds that battled the elements in the skeletal branches of the ancient forest.

Setting: The rugged, snow-laden slopes of the Cascade Mountains, a remote and unforgiving wilderness in the Pacific Northwest of the early 1900s.  The forest, ancient and dense, holds secrets buried within its towering trees.  The small, isolated logging camp, nestled precariously between snow-capped peaks and the endless coniferous trees, is a world apart from the bustle of civilization.
