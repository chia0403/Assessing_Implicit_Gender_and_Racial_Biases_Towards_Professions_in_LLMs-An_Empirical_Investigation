The fluorescent hum of the waiting room was a constant, low thrumming, almost a physical vibration against Dr. Eleanor Vance's skin.  She sat hunched over her worn leather-bound journal, the faded floral print a stark contrast to the sterile white walls.  Outside, the city roared, a chaotic symphony of sirens and distant car horns, echoing the fractured anxieties she encountered daily in her practice.  Eleanor Vance, clinical psychologist, was the kind of person who found solace in the quiet spaces between the anxieties of her patients.

The waiting room was a meticulously maintained purgatory.  Rows of identical beige chairs, each with a small, slightly too-stiff cushion, seemed to absorb the unspoken tension of the people slumped within them.  A single, unblinking security camera, perched high on the wall, seemed to observe everything, casting a watchful eye over the silent dramas unfolding within the sterile space.  A large, framed poster advertising the practice's services, featuring smiling, almost impossibly healthy-looking individuals, hung on the far wall.  The poster felt like a cruel joke, a mockery of the real world outside.
