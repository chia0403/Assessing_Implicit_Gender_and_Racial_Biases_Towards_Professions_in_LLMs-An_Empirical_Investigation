The biting wind, a relentless harbinger of winter, whipped across the skeletal branches of the ancient oak trees that bordered Elias Thorne's farm, Oakhaven.  Snow, already a foot deep in the hollows, threatened to bury the meager harvest still clinging to the vines and stalks.  Elias, weathered and stooped, pulled his threadbare wool coat tighter around him, the scent of damp earth and pine needles clinging to his clothes.  His calloused hands, gnarled with age and toil, clutched the worn leather reins of his faithful Clydesdale, Bess.  The icy grip of the Pennsylvania winter had held Oakhaven in its icy vice for weeks, and every grain of wheat, every withered carrot, whispered of the encroaching famine that threatened not only his own family, but the entire valley.  The biting cold, the relentless wind, and the gnawing anxiety over the harvest formed a triad of horrors that painted the landscape in shades of grey and despair.  The once vibrant green hills were now muted, whispering tales of hardship and loss.
