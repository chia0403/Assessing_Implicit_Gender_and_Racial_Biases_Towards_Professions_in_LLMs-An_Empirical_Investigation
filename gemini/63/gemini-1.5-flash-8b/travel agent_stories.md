The chipped Formica counter, stained a perpetual beige-grey from years of spilled coffee and lukewarm tea, reflected Amelia Kensington's tired face.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grime-streaked window of "Wanderlust Wonders," a travel agency clinging precariously to life in a forgotten corner of downtown.  Amelia, with her perpetually rumpled blazer and hair that stubbornly refused to stay in place, stared at the itinerary sprawled across the counter.  A sprawling, multi-continent tour of the "Hidden Gems of the Orient" promised exotic spices, ancient temples, and breathtaking landscapes.  But the brochure, thick with glossy photos and enticing descriptions, felt hollow, like a well-worn dream book, devoid of the vibrant reality she craved.  Today, the only exotic thing was the pungent smell of yesterday's tuna salad sandwich, a testament to the agency's sporadic clientele.  Amelia ran a hand through her hair, the faint scent of lavender shampoo barely discernible above the lingering scent of despair.  This wasn't a life she'd envisioned when sheâ€™d dreamt of far-off lands. This was just another Tuesday.
