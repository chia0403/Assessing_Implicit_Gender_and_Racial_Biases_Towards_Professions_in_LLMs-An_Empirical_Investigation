The chipped paint of the playroom walls, a faded shade of something meant to be cheerful – perhaps coral, perhaps salmon – reflected the glint of Amelia Hayes's glasses.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grimy window, illuminating a chaotic scene.  Three-year-old Leo, a whirlwind of red hair and boundless energy, was attempting to scale the jungle gym, his tiny hands gripping the wobbly wooden bars with alarming strength.  Beside him, Lily, a wisp of a girl with eyes like melted chocolate, was meticulously arranging tiny plastic dinosaurs in a meticulously neat row on the colourful rug.  And somewhere amidst the noise and activity, eight-month-old  Mateo was content to simply stare, a small, serene observer of the escalating toddler mayhem.

Amelia, a child care worker at the "Sunshine Smiles" preschool, adjusted her apron, a familiar rustle against the fabric of the day.  The faint, sickly sweet smell of Play-Doh hung heavy in the air, mingling with the lingering scent of yesterday's burnt toast that still clung to the kitchen nook.   The room, while bustling with life, felt oddly quiet, the echoing laughter muted by the weight of the afternoon. Outside, the late afternoon sky was a bruised purple, threatening a storm that felt as oppressive as the day itself.  This was a typical Tuesday at Sunshine Smiles, and Amelia, with her tired but steady gaze, knew it would probably be a long one.
