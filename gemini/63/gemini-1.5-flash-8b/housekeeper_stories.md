The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the polished mahogany floors of Blackwood Manor, illuminating dust motes that swirled in the still air.  Eleanor Ainsworth, housekeeper for the formidable Lady Ashworth, adjusted the heavy velvet curtains, ensuring the faint glow of the streetlamp outside was completely obscured.  The scent of lavender, a constant companion throughout the sprawling manor, mingled with the faint, metallic tang of something else â€“ something she couldn't quite place.  

The manor itself, a gothic masterpiece with creaking timbers and shadowed hallways, stood perched atop a windswept hill overlooking the town of Ashworth.  Ivy clung stubbornly to the crumbling stone walls, its tendrils reaching like grasping fingers towards the shadowy windows.  A chill wind whispered through the gaps in the ancient woodwork, carrying with it the rustle of fallen leaves and the distant, mournful howl of a lonely wolf.  Moonlight, fractured and ethereal, painted the grounds in a pale, silvery glow.  Eleanor knew, with a certainty that settled deep in her bones, that tonight was different.  Something was stirring within the silent walls of Blackwood Manor, something beyond the usual chill of the autumn air.
