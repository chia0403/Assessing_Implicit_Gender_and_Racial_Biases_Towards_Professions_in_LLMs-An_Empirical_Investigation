The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow across Amelia "Amie"  Kingston's face, highlighting the faint stubble on her chin.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic rhythm of her own thoughts.  The small, smoky bar was a study in quiet desperation, the only sounds the clinking of ice, the low murmur of conversations, and the rhythmic slosh of cheap whiskey in glasses.  Amie, perpetually hunched behind the worn mahogany bar, felt the weight of the night pressing down on her like a lead apron.  Empty bottles lined the shelves like fallen soldiers, each one a silent testament to the sorrows and celebrations that had passed through these cramped walls.  Outside, the city of Veridian, a sprawling metropolis built on the ruins of a forgotten empire, was shrouded in a thick, grey fog.  Tonight, Veridian felt particularly cruel, mirroring the disquiet within Amieâ€™s soul.
