The chipped paint on the cab of the 'Iron Horse' gleamed under the harsh, unforgiving desert sun.  Dust devils danced across the cracked asphalt, swirling around Amelia "Ace"  Harding's rig as she gripped the steering wheel, knuckles white.  The odometer ticked over 150,000 miles, a testament to a life lived on the open road, a life that felt more like a relentless grind than a journey.  Beyond the shimmering heat haze, the jagged peaks of the Sierra Madre stretched into the sky, silent sentinels guarding the treacherous mountain pass that lay ahead.  Ace, her face etched with the lines of countless nights spent staring into the endless darkness, knew the mountain road intimately, knew the hidden dips and treacherous curves that had claimed more than one truck and driver.  This wasn't just a delivery; it was a test, a trial, one more dance with the unforgiving landscape. The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of sagebrush and impending storm.  Tonight, the mountain would have its say.
