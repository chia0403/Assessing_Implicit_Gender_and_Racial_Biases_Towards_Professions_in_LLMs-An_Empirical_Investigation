The biting wind whipped across the frozen fields of the northern Icelandic highlands, stinging Elara "Storm" Thorsdottir's cheeks as she huddled deeper into her thick wool parka.  Below, nestled in a valley shrouded in a perpetual twilight, lay the village of Skagaströnd.  A tapestry of small, colourful houses clung precariously to the slopes, each window a tiny beacon against the encroaching gloom.  Snow, in its relentless dance with the wind, had sculpted the landscape into a landscape of jagged peaks and treacherous crevasses. This was the domain of the Northern Glaciers, a region where nature dictated the rhythm of life – a rhythm Elara, head coach of the Skagaströnd Snow Striders, understood intimately.  Her team, a ragtag bunch of fiercely independent, frost-bitten adolescents, were out on their early morning training run.  Their breath, white plumes in the frigid air, marked their passage. Elara knew the mountains were testing them, pushing them to their limits.  She, in turn, was preparing them for a challenge of even greater magnitude.  The prestigious Northern Glaciers Winter Games were fast approaching.
