The flickering fluorescent lights of the Sterling Insurance agency hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's anxieties.  Rain hammered against the grimy windows of the third-floor office, mirroring the relentless drumbeat of paperwork piled high on her desk.  It was a Tuesday in late October, the kind of day where the city outside seemed to hold its breath, waiting for the inevitable autumnal chill to settle in.  The air in the office, however, was thick with the stale scent of stale coffee and desperation.  Amy, a mid-twenties insurance agent with tired eyes and even more tired nerves, stared blankly at the overflowing file labelled "High-Risk Claims."  This was her specialty.  Her territory: the broken promises and the crumpled dreams of the city's underbelly, a world she felt increasingly ill-equipped to navigate.

The setting was a small, nondescript office building, sandwiched between a greasy spoon diner and a used bookstore, in the heart of a gritty, yet surprisingly vibrant, part of the city known as the "Five Points." The dingy, echoing space, barely large enough for the clattering of keyboards and the muffled sighs of clients, felt claustrophobic and oppressive.  The peeling paint and worn carpets hinted at a history of struggle and resilience, a story mirrored in the faces of the people who frequented the agency.  Outside, the cityscape clawed at the clouds, a tangible reminder of the looming financial pressures that weighed heavily on the residents Amy served.
