The scent of lilies and something vaguely metallic, probably the nail polish remover, hung heavy in the air of "The Polished Petal."  Sunlight, fractured by the ornate stained-glass window depicting a rose in full bloom, illuminated dust motes dancing in the humid air.  Magnolia, a manicurist with hands as precise as a surgeon’s and eyes that held a storm of unspoken emotions, meticulously filed a client’s nail, her movements fluid and deliberate.  She wore a crisp, white uniform, the immaculate starched linen a stark contrast to the vibrant hues of nail polish swirling around her. The small salon, tucked away on a quiet side street in the heart of the bustling city of Aethelgard, was a haven of calm amidst the urban clamor.  A gentle melody, almost inaudible, drifted from a hidden speaker, a soothing lullaby that masked the faint rumble of traffic outside.  Magnolia, whose full name was Magnolia Ashworth, felt a flicker of something akin to dread, a shadow that clung to her like the scent of lilies.  A persistent, uneasy feeling, the sort that heralded a storm before it even began to brew.
