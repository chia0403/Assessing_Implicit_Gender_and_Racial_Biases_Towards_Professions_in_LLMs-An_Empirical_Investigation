The fluorescent hum of the ER was a constant, low thrum beneath Amelia "Amy" Carter's skin.  It vibrated through the stainless steel of the examination tables, the chipped Formica of the waiting room counters, and, most acutely, through the frayed edges of her nerves.  It was a Tuesday night, the kind that promised a symphony of coughs, sprains, and the occasional heart attack, all vying for the attention of the small, overworked team in the Emergency Department of St. Jude's Hospital.  Amy, Physician's Assistant, hunched over a patient groaning in the corner.  The rhythmic beeping of monitors, punctuated by the clatter of gurneys and the panicked shouts of nurses, was the soundtrack to her existence, a relentless melody that played on repeat.

The emergency room, a chaotic ballet of hurried footsteps and anxious whispers, was bathed in the stark white glow of overhead lights.  A sterile, almost clinical smell hung heavy in the air, a mix of antiseptic and fear.  Rows of examination rooms, each a miniature world of urgency, lined the walls.  The air, thick with the smell of stale coffee and the antiseptic odor of countless traumas, pressed against the patients, and against the staff, molding them into a single, stressed collective.  Outside the main doors, the city pulsed with a life Amy couldn't fully engage with.  She was trapped, for now, inside the rhythmic beat of the emergency room.
