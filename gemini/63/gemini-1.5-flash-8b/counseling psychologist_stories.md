Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Dr. Eleanor Vance's tiny office, a rhythmic counterpoint to the frantic tapping of her fingers on the worn wooden desk.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and mildew, hung heavy in the small, cluttered space.  Eleanor Vance, a counseling psychologist with a practiced empathy that masked a perpetually anxious heart, stared at the crumpled note clutched in her hand.  It was from Mr. Arthur Grimshaw, a regular client, but this note felt different.  It was barely legible, scrawled in a frantic, almost desperate hand.  The words simply read, "Something... terrible.  I need to see you now."

The setting was the forgotten corner of Oakhaven, a once-bustling town now teetering on the brink of decay.  Old, Victorian houses, their paint peeling and their gardens overgrown, lined the narrow, rain-slicked streets.  The relentless downpour reflected in the murky waters pooling in the gutters, mirroring the anxieties swirling within Eleanor's chest.  A palpable sense of foreboding clung to the air, a feeling that even the weathered oaks seemed to share.  The town's history, a tapestry woven with secrets and unspoken tragedies, whispered through the wind-swept streets, a constant undercurrent to the present moment.  The impending doom hinted at in Mr. Grimshaw's note hung heavy over Oakhaven, a shadow stretching long and ominous, a shadow Eleanor now felt inextricably linked to.
