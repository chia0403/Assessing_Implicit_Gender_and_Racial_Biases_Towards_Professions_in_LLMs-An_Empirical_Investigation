The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's auburn hair across her face as she navigated the narrow, cobbled streets of the historic district.  Sunlight, fractured by the looming, grey stone buildings, cast long shadows that danced with the swirling leaves.  A chill, deeper than the air, settled in her bones, a feeling mirrored by the quiet solemnity of the neighborhood.  This wasn't the bustling, vibrant part of the city Amy was usually accustomed to.  This was the "forgotten corner," a collection of meticulously preserved, yet somewhat dilapidated, Victorian homes that whispered tales of bygone eras.  Her mission: to sell a home that had stood vacant for almost a decade, a house locals called the "Grey Ghost."

Amy, a real estate agent with the prestigious firm, Sterling & Stone, adjusted her oversized scarf and tightened her grip on her leather satchel.  The house itself was the last on the block, its darkened facade almost swallowed by the encroaching shadows.  Its aged, grey paint, once a rich cream, now looked bruised and worn, the few remaining flowers in the meager garden bed stubbornly clinging to life despite the harsh weather.  A tattered, faded "For Sale" sign, barely visible through the dense foliage, confirmed her destination. The scent of damp earth and old wood, mingled with the sharp tang of pine from nearby trees, filled her nostrils.  The house, like the neighborhood itself, held a palpable sense of history, of stories waiting to be unearthed.  Amy knew this sale would be different.
