The biting wind whipped Elias Thorne's worn canvas jacket around him, stinging his exposed cheeks.  He gripped the rusted metal ladder, the familiar cold a comforting counterpoint to the icy rain lashing against the corrugated iron roof.  Below, the city sprawled, a chaotic tapestry of flickering lights and towering buildings, all swallowed by the encroaching twilight.  He was high above it all, a solitary figure perched on the precarious edge of the world, the only sound the relentless drumming of the rain on the roof and the distant, mournful wail of a siren.  Elias, a roofer with calloused hands and eyes that held the wisdom of a thousand storms, was accustomed to this solitary dance with the elements.  This particular roof, the aged, peeling shingles of the Grandview Hotel, felt heavier than usual.  Something about the way the rain seemed to gather in the shadowed valleys of the roofline hinted at a deeper unease, a silent story hidden beneath the relentless downpour.  He wasn't sure what he was looking for, but the feeling in the air feltâ€¦wrong.  The city, usually a cacophony of life, seemed to hold its breath, as if even the streetlights were whispering secrets.
