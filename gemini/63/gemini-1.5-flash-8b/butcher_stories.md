The chill of the November air, thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, snaked through the creaky wooden planks of Bartholomew "Barty" Grimshaw's butcher shop, "The Cleaver's Cut."  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the grime-coated window, illuminating a glistening array of freshly butchered haunches of venison, their ruby-red surfaces glistening like polished jewels.  Barty, a man whose hands, roughened by years of wielding cleavers and carving knives, were as strong as oak, meticulously examined a plump, almost iridescent, pig's head, its eyes seemingly staring judgmentally at him.

The shop itself was a testament to its age and Barty's tireless dedication.  Meat hung from hooks like sculpted trophies, the air thick with the satisfying aroma of curing spices and woodsmoke.  A rusted metal trough, overflowing with blood, sat in a corner, a constant reminder of the lifeblood Barty wrestled with every day.  A chipped porcelain sink, stained a deep mahogany from years of washing knives, gleamed faintly under the weak light.  The counter, scarred with deep gouges and splatters of blood, reflected the flickering candlelight dancing on Barty's face, a face etched with lines that spoke of both hard work and silent contemplation.  The rhythmic clanking of Barty's knife against bone echoed through the almost silent space, the only sound other than the occasional rustle of fabric from a distant, unseen neighbour.
