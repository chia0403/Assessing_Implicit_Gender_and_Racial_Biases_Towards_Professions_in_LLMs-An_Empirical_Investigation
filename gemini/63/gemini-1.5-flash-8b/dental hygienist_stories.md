The fluorescent hum of the waiting room, a relentless drone punctuated only by the rhythmic click-clack of Amelia "Amy" Hayes's meticulously organized file cabinet, was a familiar soundtrack to her life.  Today, however, the hum seemed to vibrate with an unnerving undercurrent.  She glanced at the clock, the second hand a mocking metronome against the sterile white walls.  10:15 AM.  Five minutes until the first appointment of the day, and already Amy felt the familiar knot tightening in her stomach.  The waiting room, usually a quiet symphony of nervous fidgeting and whispered anxieties, was unusually still.  A single, heavy oak door, etched with intricate carvings of stylized teeth, stood sentinel at the far end of the room.  Beyond it lay the sanctuary, or rather, the battlefield, of her practice:  Dr. Alistair Finch's Dental Clinic.  The office, tucked away on a quiet street in the heart of the historic district of Oakhaven, was a curious blend of old-world charm and modern efficiency.  Antique mirrors hung alongside state-of-the-art dental equipment, casting long shadows that danced with the dust motes drifting in the filtered light.  The faint scent of antiseptic and sandalwood hung in the air, a comforting aroma that always managed to mask, just barely, the faint metallic tang of fear.
