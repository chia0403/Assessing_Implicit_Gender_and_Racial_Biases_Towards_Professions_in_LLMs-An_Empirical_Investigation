The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Willow Creek Florist, a rhythmic tattoo that echoed the frantic beat of Elara Nightingale's heart.  Water, slick and cold, dripped from the eaves, pooling on the already saturated soil surrounding the small, unassuming shop.  Inside, the scent of lilies and roses, normally a comforting balm, felt heavy, almost oppressive. Elara, a wisp of a woman with eyes the colour of bruised plums, hunched over a meticulously arranged bouquet of lavender and forget-me-nots.  The vibrant hues seemed to mock the grey gloom outside.

Willow Creek itself was a picturesque, yet melancholic, village nestled in a valley between towering, jagged mountains.  Cobbled streets, lined with ancient, moss-covered houses, seemed to hold their breath, waiting for the storm to subside.  The air, thick with the damp aroma of pine and earth, carried whispers of secrets buried deep within the hillsides.  A perpetual mist clung to the valley floor, shrouding the village in an ethereal, otherworldly glow,  and tonight, the mist seemed particularly thick, clinging to the already heavy, anxious feeling Elara felt.  This wasn't just any storm; it felt like a storm brewing within her own soul.
