Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the "Rusty Mug," a dimly lit dive bar clinging precariously to the side of the crumbling Victorian district.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale beer and desperation.  Amelia "Ace"  Ashworth, her trench coat plastered to her frame by the deluge, surveyed the room with the cool detachment of a seasoned predator.  Her sharp eyes, the color of a stormy sea, scanned the huddled patrons, each face a potential clue, each whispered conversation a possible lead.  Ace, private investigator extraordinaire, was on the case.  The victim, a renowned art collector named Bartholomew "Barty" Finch, had vanished from his opulent penthouse overlooking the city, leaving behind only a cryptic note hinting at a hidden trove of stolen antiquities and a shadowy organization known as the Serpent's Coil.

The setting was the rain-slicked, fog-shrouded streets of Ashworth City, a sprawling metropolis built on a network of canals and hidden alleys.  The Victorian district, nestled between the towering skyscrapers of the central business district and the grimy docks of the port, pulsed with a unique energy, a blend of decaying grandeur and simmering discontent.  Whispers of illicit dealings and clandestine meetings drifted through the narrow cobbled streets, carried on the wind and the relentless drumming of rain.  The city itself felt like a character, a vast, unpredictable stage for Ace's private dramas.
