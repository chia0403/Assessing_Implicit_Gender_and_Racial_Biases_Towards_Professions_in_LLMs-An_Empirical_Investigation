The flickering fluorescent lights of the Zenith Radio Repair Shop hummed a discordant counterpoint to the rhythmic click-clack of Amelia Peabody's fingers on the soldering iron.  Dust motes, illuminated by the harsh glare, danced in the air, suspended between the chipped Formica countertop and the grimy window overlooking a bustling, rain-slicked city street.  Rain lashed against the glass, blurring the neon signs into hazy streaks of colour.  Amelia, a wiry woman with perpetually tired eyes and a tangle of dark curls escaping her faded denim cap, focused intently on the intricate wiring of a vintage Zenith radio.  The year was 1987.
