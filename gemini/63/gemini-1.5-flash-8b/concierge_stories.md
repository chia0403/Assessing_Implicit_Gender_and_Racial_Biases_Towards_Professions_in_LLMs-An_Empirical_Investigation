The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual greyish-brown, reflected the flickering gaslight above the entrance hall of the Grand Astorian Hotel.  Rain lashed against the leaded windows, a relentless drumbeat that echoed the frantic rhythm in Amelia Nightingale's chest.  The year was 1928.

The Astorian, a monument of towering grandeur in the heart of Mayfair, stood as a silent sentinel, its ornate facade almost swallowed by the tempest.  Amelia, a petite woman with eyes the colour of storm clouds and a voice like polished mahogany, was the hotel's resident concierge.  Her meticulously pressed uniform, a navy blue dress that seemed to absorb the light, contrasted sharply with the pervasive atmosphere of impending doom.  Tonight, the Astorian, usually a beacon of warmth and luxury, felt strangely cold, echoing with the muffled whispers of unseen anxieties.  A single, solitary guest, a Mr. Alistair Finch, awaited her attention.
