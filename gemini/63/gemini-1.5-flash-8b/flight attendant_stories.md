The humid air hung thick and heavy, a palpable shroud clinging to the polished brass of the first-class cabin.  Amelia "Amy" Carmichael, her name embroidered on the crisp white uniform, felt it pressing down on her shoulders like a physical weight.  The recycled air, heavy with the scent of expensive perfume and the faint metallic tang of jet fuel, mirrored the suffocating tension in the cabin.  The 747,  named "The Sapphire Star," stretched out before her like a shimmering, silver leviathan, its wings poised for take-off over the sprawling tarmac of Singapore Changi Airport.  Amy, twenty-seven and meticulously crafted in her ivory uniform,  was already anticipating the inevitable flight delays, the predictable complaints, the near-inevitable drama.

The setting: Singapore Changi Airport, a glittering, futuristic hub bathed in the warm, humid glow of a late-afternoon tropical sun.  The vast expanse of the terminal bustled with a kaleidoscope of colours and languages.  Beyond the polished floors and sky-piercing pillars, the dense jungle canopy of Singapore loomed, a wild counterpoint to the sterile precision of the airport.
