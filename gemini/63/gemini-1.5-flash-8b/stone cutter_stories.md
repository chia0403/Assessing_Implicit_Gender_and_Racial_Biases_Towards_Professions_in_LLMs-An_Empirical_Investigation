The rasping screech of the chisel against flint-hard granite echoed through the narrow valley, a mournful counterpoint to the incessant drone of cicadas.  Dust motes, the colour of aged amethyst, danced in the midday sun, illuminating the craggy face of Mount Veridian.  This was Elias Thorne's domain, a sun-baked, windswept outcrop nestled deep within the heart of the Whispering Peaks.  Stone, the very essence of the mountain itself, was the substance of his life.

Elias Thorne, a stone-cutter of unmatched skill and unwavering resolve, had carved his living from the mountain's breast for twenty years. His hands, gnarled and weathered, possessed a memory as profound as the mountain's own, able to coax the desired shape from the most stubborn block.  Every furrow, every vein of the granite spoke of ages past, and Elias, attuned to these whispers, felt a profound connection to the mountain's spirit.
