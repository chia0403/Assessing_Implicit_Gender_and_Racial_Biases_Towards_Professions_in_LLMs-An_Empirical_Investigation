The biting wind howled a mournful dirge through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks, rattling the corrugated iron roof of the dilapidated fire station.  Rain, a relentless curtain of icy needles, hammered against the weathered walls, mirroring the frantic drumming in Captain Amelia "Amy"  Rivera's chest.  The station, a relic from a bygone era, stood perched precariously on the windswept edge of Blackwood Ridge, a forgotten corner of the city, where the only lights seemed to be those flickering from the scattered, isolated houses clinging to the slopes.  Amy, her breath clouding in the frigid air, stared out at the swirling grey tempest, her gaze fixed on the flickering emergency lights of a distant house, a beacon in the storm's fury.  Inside, the small, cramped station felt claustrophobic, the smell of damp earth and ozone clinging to the air.  A lone, sputtering fluorescent light flickered above the worn-out map of the district, highlighting the route to Oakhaven. The call had come in sharp and insistent, a chilling prelude to the possible chaos ahead.
