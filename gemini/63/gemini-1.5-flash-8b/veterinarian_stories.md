The biting wind whipped Amelia "Maisie" Blackwood's tweed coat around her legs as she navigated the treacherous, ice-slicked path to the Blackwood Veterinary Clinic.  The clinic, nestled deep within the shadowed valley of Whisperwind Ridge, was a ramshackle affair, its weathered wooden exterior stained a muted grey by years of harsh winters and countless storms.  Snow, thick and pristine, piled high against the windows, obscuring the dim, flickering light within.  Maisie, despite the biting cold, felt a familiar knot of apprehension tighten in her stomach.  Tonight's case was particularly unusual.  A frantic call from farmer Silas Finch, owner of the sprawling Finchcrest Farm, had brought her out into the unforgiving wilderness.  Silas had reported strange ailments affecting the livestock: a peculiar lethargy, coupled with a glistening, almost oily sheen on their coats.  The animals weren't exhibiting any obvious signs of illness, yet something about them feltâ€¦ wrong.  Each rustle of the snow-laden branches, each creak of the ancient, groaning farmhouse, amplified the unsettling feeling.  Inside, the flickering gaslight cast long shadows that danced with the swirling snow outside, creating an eerie, almost spectral atmosphere.
