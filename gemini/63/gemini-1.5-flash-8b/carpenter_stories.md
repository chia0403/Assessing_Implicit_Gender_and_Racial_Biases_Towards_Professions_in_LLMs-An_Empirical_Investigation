The biting wind whipped at the eaves of the workshop, rattling the faded sign that proclaimed "Elias Thorne, Carpenter."  Elias Thorne, a man whose hands, weathered and calloused like the oak beams he shaped, were currently cradling a piece of polished cherrywood.  He worked in a small, cluttered space, the air thick with the scent of sawdust and linseed oil.  Sunlight, filtered through the grime-coated windowpanes, illuminated dust motes dancing in the air.  Tools, a collection of hammers, chisels, and planes of varying ages, leaned against the walls, their metal dulled by years of use.  A lone hearth, the only source of warmth, crackled merrily, its flames painting dancing shadows on the rough-hewn table where Elias meticulously measured and marked his wood.  Outside, the village of Oakhaven, nestled in the valley below, looked like a patchwork quilt of grey roofs and shadowed trees under the encroaching twilight.  The cold, relentless wind howled a mournful tune.
