The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's tweed coat around her legs as she trudged down the deserted path, the rhythmic crunch of frost-laden leaves underfoot the only sound besides the mournful hooting of a Great Horned Owl from the ancient oaks that draped the hillside.  The air, thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, held the promise of a snowstorm, a promise Amelia welcomed with a quiet sort of dread.  She was the Animal Caretaker for Blackwood Manor, a sprawling estate steeped in history and secrets, and tonight, the responsibility for the twenty-four creatures under her charge weighed heavily on her shoulders.  The estate, a Victorian monstrosity of grey stone and ivy-clad walls, was practically alive with the nocturnal symphony of rustling leaves, the low groans of the old house itself, and the occasional frantic chirps of the nocturnal creatures.  Amelia, her breath misting in the frigid air, knew that each animal – from the fluffy Himalayan mountain goats in their stone enclosure to the silent, enigmatic owls nesting in the rafters of the stables – needed her watchful eye.   The Manor, though grand in scale, held a spectral melancholy that clung to its very walls, a palpable echo of forgotten stories and whispered tragedies.
