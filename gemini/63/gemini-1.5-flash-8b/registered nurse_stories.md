The sterile white of the operating room hummed with a low, insistent thrum, a counterpoint to the frantic beeping of monitors.  Dr. Alistair Finch, a man whose face betrayed a lifetime of surgical stress, was focused, his brow furrowed, as he painstakingly stitched the patient's laceration.  Across the room, bathed in the pale glow of the overhead lights, Amelia Blackwood, a registered nurse with a practiced grace that belied her twenty-seven years, methodically checked the IV drip rate and restocked the sterile trays.

The setting:  St. Jude's General Hospital, a sprawling institution nestled in the heart of the sprawling, grey metropolis of Zenith.  The air, thick with the scent of antiseptic and fear, hung heavy in the operating theatre.  Rain hammered against the windows, mirroring the relentless rhythm of Amelia's heartbeat, each drop a reminder of the relentless, unseen forces that battled for the lives entrusted to her care.  The city outside was a blur of neon lights and shadowy alleys, a stark contrast to the carefully controlled environment of the operating theatre where life and death were played out on a microscopic scale.
