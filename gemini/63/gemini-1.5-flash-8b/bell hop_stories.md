The chipped porcelain sink of the Grand Wyndham Hotel's employee restroom, perpetually coated in a film of grime and the faint scent of old cigarettes, reflected the pale, anxious face of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield.  He squinted, tracing the smudged lines of a faded map pinned to the cracked tile wall.  The map, a faded relic of a forgotten promotion, detailed the routes of the hotel's bellhops, a labyrinth of hallways and stairwells, each path a potential minefield.  His assignment, the key to his livelihood and his hopes for tonight, was to deliver a precious, unmarked package to the esteemed Mr. Alistair Finch in Room 707.  The Grand Wyndham, once a beacon of opulence, now whispered tales of shifting fortunes and secretive dealings in its grand, echoing halls.  The air, thick with the perfume of lilies and the lingering scent of desperation, held the promise of both glamour and peril.
