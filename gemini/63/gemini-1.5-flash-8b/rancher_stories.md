The wind, a relentless, icy knife, sliced through the skeletal branches of the aspens, whipping dust devils across the parched plains.  Dawn, a grudging, pale blush on the horizon, offered little comfort to Elias Thorne, a rancher of the High Plains.  The year was 1887, and the dust-choked valley of the Dry Fork River, once a vibrant tapestry of grass and wildflowers, was now a canvas of ochre and despair.  His weathered face, etched with the stories of countless sunrises and sunsets on this unforgiving land, bore the weight of a drought that had gripped the region for three agonizing years.  Horses, gaunt and weak, huddled beneath the meager shade of the few remaining willow trees, their ribs clearly visible beneath their thin coats.  Elias, his weathered hands calloused and cracked, gripped the worn reins of his aging mustang, a faithful companion named Comet.  The biting wind seemed to whisper tales of hardship and loss around him, a relentless chorus of the land's suffering.  He felt the silent pressure of his responsibility, the weight of the families that depended on his cattle, his livelihood.  His heart, though hardened by the trials of the plains, ached with a familiar, desperate longing for rain.
