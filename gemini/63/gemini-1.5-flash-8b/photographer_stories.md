The biting wind whipped Amelia Petrova's long, dark hair across her face as she crouched low, her lens pressed against the frosted glass of the abandoned greenhouse.  Sunlight, fractured and ethereal, bled through the shattered panes, painting the interior in a kaleidoscope of fractured colours.  Moss, thick and emerald green, clung to the rusted iron supports, weaving a tapestry of decay over the skeletal remains of what had once been a vibrant garden. This forgotten corner of the city, nestled between a crumbling apartment block and a forgotten railway line, was Amelia's sanctuary, her laboratory for capturing the ephemeral beauty of decay.  It was here, surrounded by the whispered ghosts of former glory, that she found her muse.  Amelia, a photographer known for her haunting portraits of urban decay, sought to capture the stories whispered on the wind.  The air, thick with the smell of damp earth and forgotten memories, carried a secret, a story waiting to be told.
