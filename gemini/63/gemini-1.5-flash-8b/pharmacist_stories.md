The fluorescent hum of the pharmacy, "Apothecary's Corner," thrummed a constant, low-level anxiety.  Rain hammered against the corrugated metal roof, mirroring the relentless drumming in Elara Blackwood's temples.  The scent of antiseptic and old paper, usually comforting, felt oppressive tonight.  It was a Tuesday, the slowest night of the week, yet Elara, meticulously wiping down the mahogany counter, felt the clock's hands move in agonizing slow motion.  Outside, the city's cacophony—the rumble of distant traffic, the occasional siren wail—seemed to press in on the small, cluttered shop, amplifying the silence within.  Elara, 32, with dark, tired eyes and a perpetually furrowed brow, was a pharmacist in the heart of a city struggling with a creeping undercurrent of unease.  This particular Tuesday was different. Not in the chaotic, bustling way of a Saturday, but in the unsettling calm before the storm.  The air, usually thick with the smells of herbs and healing salves, felt... heavy.
