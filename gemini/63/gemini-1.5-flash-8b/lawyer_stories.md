The chipped Formica countertop gleamed under the harsh fluorescent lights of the cramped downtown office.  Rain hammered against the grimy windowpanes, mirroring the relentless drumming of Amelia "Amy"  Charleston's thoughts.  Amy, a junior associate at the prestigious, yet notoriously cutthroat, Sterling & Sterling law firm, stared at the meticulously organized (yet still overflowing) file labelled "The Blackwood Estate Case."

The office building, a concrete monolith rising precariously from the urban sprawl, seemed to swallow the city's noise in its cavernous maw.  The scent of stale coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air, a constant companion to the gnawing anxieties that settled in Amy's gut.  She was acutely aware that her perceived inexperience, coupled with the firm's ruthless ambition, could easily swallow her whole.  The city itself, a chaotic symphony of honking taxis and whispering alleys, seemed to echo her own inner turmoil.  Each raindrop that hit the glass felt like a judgment, a reminder of the weighty responsibilities she bore, both professionally and personally.
