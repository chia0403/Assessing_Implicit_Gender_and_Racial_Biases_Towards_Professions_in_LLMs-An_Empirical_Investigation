The fluorescent lights of the "Ironclad Athlete" gym hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Kensington's daily ritual.  Dust motes danced in the beams, illuminating the gleaming rows of weight machines and the sweat-slicked floor, a testament to the relentless energy Amelia poured into each class.  Today, however, the air felt different.  A thick, almost palpable tension hung in the humid summer air, a subtle shift from the usual frenetic energy of her 6 AM Power Sculpt class.  Amelia, a woman with muscles sculpted from years of rigorous training, felt it too.  The usual cheer of her regulars seemed muted, replaced by a low-key buzz of anticipation.  This morningâ€™s class was supposed to be a regular Tuesday session, but rumors whispered through the community that something extraordinary was about to happen.  Something bigger than even the usual high-energy training.
