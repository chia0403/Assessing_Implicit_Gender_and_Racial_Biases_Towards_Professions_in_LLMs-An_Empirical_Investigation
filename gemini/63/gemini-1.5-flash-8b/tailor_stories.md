The scent of beeswax and aged linen hung heavy in the air of Silas Blackwood's workshop, a comforting aroma that had been his constant companion for thirty-five years.  Sunlight, filtered through the dusty panes of the small, cobbled alleyway shop, illuminated the intricate patterns etched into the fabric spread across his wooden table.  Silas Blackwood, his face etched with the lines of countless hours spent meticulously crafting garments, meticulously pinned a tiny, iridescent thread to a delicate silk scarf.  Dust motes danced in the shafts of light, mirroring the countless stories whispered within the walls of his establishment, stories of kings and queens, merchants and mistresses, all sewn into the fabric of his life.  His workshop, nestled between a bustling market square and a shadowed, labyrinthine alley, held more secrets than a king's treasury, and Silas, with his discerning eye and steady hands, was the keeper of them all.
