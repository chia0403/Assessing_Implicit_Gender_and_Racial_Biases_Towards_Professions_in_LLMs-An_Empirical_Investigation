The flickering neon sign of "The Leaky Faucet" cast a sickly yellow glow on Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's greasy overalls.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the tiny, dilapidated workshop, mimicking the relentless thump-thump-thump of Barty's own heart.  He hunched over a cracked porcelain sink, his calloused hands wrestling with a stubborn drainpipe.  The workshop, barely larger than a walk-in closet, reeked of mildew and stale coffee, the aroma compounded by the metallic tang of pipes and solder.  Sunlight, fractured and distorted by the grime-coated windows, illuminated dust motes dancing in the air.  Outside, the city of Aethelgard – a sprawling metropolis of towering skyscrapers and hidden alleyways – churned with the restless energy of a beast awakening.  Barty, however, felt trapped in the suffocating stillness of his tiny workshop.  His meticulously organized tool collection, each instrument gleaming with a quiet promise of fixing, was rendered mute under the relentless pressure of the unending plumbing woes.  He was, as usual, utterly alone.
