The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the chipped linoleum floor of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's barbershop, "The Clipper's Edge."  Dust motes, illuminated by the single bulb hanging precariously from the ceiling, swirled in the air, mimicking the anxious flutter in Barty's own chest.  It was a Tuesday night, a usually quiet evening for the shop nestled on the backstreets of the burgeoning industrial city of Ashbrook, but tonight, a palpable tension hung heavy in the air.  Rain hammered against the narrow storefront windows, echoing the rhythmic thumping of Barty's heart.  Across the small room, his loyal, if somewhat eccentric, customer, Mr. Grimshaw, sat stiffly in the wooden barber's chair, his face a mask of strained composure.  The scent of lavender shaving cream, usually a comforting balm, felt almost suffocating.
