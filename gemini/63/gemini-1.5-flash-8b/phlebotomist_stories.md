The fluorescent lights of the Hematology ward hummed, a monotonous drone that echoed the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's heart.  Each beep of the heart monitor, each whir of the centrifuge, was a metronome counting down to the next draw.  Amy, a phlebotomist at the sprawling Saint Jude's Medical Center, meticulously wiped the antiseptic pad on a patient's arm, her movements practiced, almost robotic.  The sterile scent of iodine hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint, metallic tang of fear â€“ a scent she'd become all too familiar with over the years.

The ward, a vast expanse of beige walls and sterile white furniture, pulsed with a subdued energy.  Rows of hospital beds stretched into the distance, each a miniature world of worried faces and whispered anxieties.  Sunlight, filtered through the grimy windows, cast long shadows across the floor, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air.  The constant murmur of hushed conversations, the rhythmic beeping of machines, and the occasional cough of a patient formed a subtle, almost mournful symphony. This wasn't a place of healing; it was a place where the body's own battles were fought and, all too often, lost.  Amy felt the weight of it pressing down, a silent, palpable pressure on her chest.
