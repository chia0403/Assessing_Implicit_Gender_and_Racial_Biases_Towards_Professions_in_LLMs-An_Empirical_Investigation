The humid air hung heavy in the small, sun-drenched office of Dr. Amelia Hayes, Chiropractor.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sunlight filtering through the grimy windowpanes, illuminating a chaotic array of medical equipment:  a gleaming adjustment table, a worn massage chair, and a stack of X-ray films taller than Amelia herself.  The scent of antiseptic mingled with the faint aroma of brewing coffee, a constant companion in the otherwise quiet room.  Amelia, a woman with the kind of tired strength etched into her face that spoke volumes of late nights and countless adjustments, shifted in her swivel chair, the worn leather squeaking a mournful counterpoint to the rhythmic hum of the air conditioner.  Outside, the city buzzed with its relentless cacophony of sirens and car horns, a constant reminder of the aching bodies that filled her waiting room.  It was a Tuesday afternoon, and Amelia knew, with a sinking feeling in her stomach, that this one would be different.
