The chipped Formica countertop hummed with a low, almost imperceptible thrum, a constant counterpoint to the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Amelia Kensington's fingers on the keyboard.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of afternoon sunlight piercing the grimy window of the "Acme Architectural Abstractions" office.  The air hung thick with the smell of stale coffee and forgotten deadlines.  Amelia, a petite woman with perpetually tired eyes and a smile that felt more practiced than genuine, stared at the blinking cursor.  Another email, another client request.  Another day at the front desk of a company that seemed to exist solely in the realms of theoretical design and existential architecture.


The office, a cramped space tucked away on a side street in the forgotten corner of a city known more for its history than its dynamism, was a testament to architectural ambition failing to fully realize itself.  Rustic wooden beams supported an overly high ceiling, painted in a gradient of depressing greys.  Oddly-shaped, almost skeletal models of buildings, some unfinished, others covered in a layer of accumulated dust, dominated the space, whispering tales of unrealized visions. A half-eaten bowl of fruit sat on a small, mismatched table, the only hint of life amidst the sterile perfection of unfulfilled dreams.
