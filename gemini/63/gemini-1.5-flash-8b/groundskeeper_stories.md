The biting November wind whipped Amelia Hawthorne’s thin wool jacket around her as she surveyed the skeletal remains of the rose garden.  Crimson petals, once a vibrant testament to summer’s bounty, were now scattered like fallen confetti, swirling in the eddies of icy air.  Frost, a fine white lace, clung to the gnarled branches of the ancient oak trees that framed the sprawling estate of Blackwood Manor.  Amelia, groundskeeper for Blackwood Manor for the past ten years, shivered, but not from the cold alone.  A sense of foreboding, thick and heavy as the encroaching winter, settled over her.  It wasn't just the desolate beauty of the dying season; it was the profound stillness, the absence of the usual autumnal symphony of rustling leaves and chirping birds that had always marked the end of summer.  A silence heavy with secrets, a silence that whispered of something unseen, something amiss.

Blackwood Manor, a gothic masterpiece of dark stone and towering turrets, loomed over the grounds.  Its many windows, like watchful eyes, stared out at the empty landscape.  For generations, the manor had guarded its secrets, its history, its very soul, ensconced within its ancient walls.  The sprawling estate, stretching for acres in every direction, was a testament to opulence and decay.  Ivy, a relentless green serpent, choked the foundations of abandoned outbuildings, while meticulously trimmed boxwood hedges, silent sentinels, lined the paths.  Amelia knew every crevice, every shadow, every whispered story etched into the very stones of the grounds.  But tonight, a new chill, a new mystery, clung to the air, beckoning her deeper into the heart of the secrets it held.
