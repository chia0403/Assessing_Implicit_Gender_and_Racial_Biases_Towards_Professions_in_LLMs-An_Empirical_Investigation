## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The waiting room of "Sunshine Smiles Dental," a cheerfully painted practice on the main street of Havenwood, a small, picturesque town nestled in the rolling hills of Vermont. Sunlight streams through the large windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. The scent of peppermint toothpaste and floral air freshener hangs heavy, battling for dominance. A stack of well-thumbed magazines promises escape, while a fish tank bubbles quietly in the corner, its inhabitants oblivious to the anxiety brewing in the humans around them.

**Story Opening:**

Cecelia Mae Harding sighed, smoothing the crisp collar of her uniform. Outside, the vibrant autumn leaves of Havenwood were putting on their annual show, a fiery spectacle of reds and golds that drew tourists from miles around. Inside, however, it was a different kind of show – a performance of tight smiles, nervous fidgeting, and the occasional muffled groan. As a dental hygienist for over a decade, Cecelia knew the script by heart. She'd seen it all, from toddler tantrums to grown men who looked like they were about to faint at the mere mention of flossing. Today, however, there was a different kind of tension in the air, something thicker and more palpable than the usual dental anxiety. It crackled, like static electricity before a storm, and Cecelia could feel it clinging to the peppermint-scented air. It had started with the cryptic phone call that morning, and now, as she glanced at the clock, she knew things were about to get a whole lot more…interesting.
