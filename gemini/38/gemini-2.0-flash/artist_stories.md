## Story Opening:

The smell of turpentine and burnt coffee hung heavy in the air, clinging to the threadbare Persian rug and the overflowing ashtray that seemed to breed dust bunnies overnight. Amelia Rose Hawthorne, her fingers stained with ochre and crimson, leaned back from her easel, a groan escaping her lips. Light from the grimy attic window, fractured by years of ingrained dirt, slashed across her face, illuminating the weariness etched around her eyes. The canvas stared back at her, a blank, mocking white expanse. It was supposed to be a portrait of Mrs. Abernathy’s prize-winning poodle, Fluffy, but all Amelia could see was a swirling vortex of self-doubt. Another commission, another bill, another crushing reminder that “starving artist” was less a romantic notion and more a brutally accurate job description.

## Setting:

Amelia’s studio occupied the dusty, neglected attic of a Victorian townhouse in the crumbling heart of Providence, Rhode Island. The building itself was a patchwork of faded glory and imminent collapse, a monument to a forgotten era of prosperity. Leaky ceilings, warped floorboards, and cobwebs thick enough to serve as hammocks were the norm. The furniture consisted mostly of salvaged finds: a mismatched collection of antique chairs covered in paint splatters, a drafting table scavenged from a flea market, and a chipped enamel sink stained with generations of artistic endeavors. Sunlight, when it dared to penetrate the grime, illuminated swirling motes of dust that danced in the air like tiny spirits, a constant reminder of the decay that permeated the very bones of the house, and perhaps, Amelia's own artistic ambitions. The air was thick with the ghosts of previous residents, a blend of genteel poverty and artistic eccentricity that resonated with Amelia's own precarious existence.
