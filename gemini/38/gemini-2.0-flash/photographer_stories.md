The biting wind, laced with the promise of snow, whipped around Abigail "Abbey" Rosewood as she wrestled with her tripod on the desolate clifftop. The year was 1938, and the location: a remote, windswept promontory jutting out into the churning North Sea. This was the Godwit Head, a notorious landmark for sailors, its jagged teeth of rock often shrouded in a blinding fog. Today, however, the visibility was miraculously clear, allowing Abbey a panoramic view of the dramatic coastline stretching away in both directions.

She hunched deeper into her tweed coat, the wool scratching against her skin. The salty spray stung her face, but her eyes remained fixed on the distant horizon, a steel-grey canvas punctuated by the occasional whitecap. This harsh, unforgiving landscape was precisely what Abbey had come for. She wasn't interested in the manicured gardens and smiling faces that filled the glossy magazines in London. Abbey Rosewood craved the raw, untamed beauty of the natural world, a beauty she felt compelled to capture with her trusty Rolleiflex. This trip, a self-funded expedition to document the vanishing landscapes of the British Isles, was her passion, her escape, and, she hoped, her key to finally being taken seriously in a male-dominated profession.
