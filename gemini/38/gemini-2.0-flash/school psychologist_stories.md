## The Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The story opens in the cramped, perpetually cluttered office of the school psychologist at Northwood Heights Elementary School in Cedar Creek, Wisconsin. It's early October, the air thick with the scent of fallen leaves and impending pumpkin spice lattes. Sunlight, filtered through a kaleidoscope of brightly colored construction paper stars taped to the window, illuminates dust motes dancing above a precarious stack of case files. A half-eaten granola bar sits forgotten on a coaster next to a lukewarm mug adorned with a cartoon sloth and the phrase "Hang in There!"

**Story Opening:**

The ringing of the ancient, beige rotary phone startled Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Ainsworth, jolting her from a particularly engrossing chapter on the neurobiology of childhood anxiety. She sighed, rubbing the bridge of her nose. The afternoon was already a juggling act of parent conferences, behavioral observations, and the lingering feeling that she’d forgotten to schedule the mandatory fire safety drill presentation. She snatched up the receiver, the familiar plastic cool against her ear.

"Dr. Ainsworth, school psychologist," she said, projecting an air of calm efficiency that felt entirely at odds with the organized chaos of her office.

A choked sob crackled from the other end. "Dr. Ainsworth… it's Mrs. Peterson, Mikey's teacher. Something... something terrible has happened." Ellie's heart clenched. That sinking feeling, the one she’d learned to dread in her years at Northwood Heights, twisted in her gut. This was more than a forgotten homework assignment or a playground squabble. This felt…different.
