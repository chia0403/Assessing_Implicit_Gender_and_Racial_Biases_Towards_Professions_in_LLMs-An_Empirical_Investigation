## Opening and Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The rhythmic clatter of the pill counter echoed in the hushed quiet of Oakhaven Pharmacy, a sound Elias Thorne found strangely comforting. Even at 6:15 AM, before the first rays of dawn had fully chased away the inky blackness, he was here, meticulously counting out amoxicillin capsules. His breath fogged slightly in the chilly air, a reminder that winter, despite its late start, still had teeth. He hadn't slept well, plagued by the same gnawing anxiety that had been his unwelcome companion for weeks. Tonight, the meeting. Tonight, he would finally know. He finished the count, securing the label onto the amber vial, and sighed, a puff of condensation disappearing into the dimly lit space. He reached for the next prescription, hoping, as he did every morning, that today would be different. That today, the pressure wouldn't feel so crushing.

**Setting:**

Oakhaven Pharmacy was a relic. Located in the heart of the small, almost stubbornly quaint town of Oakhaven, Pennsylvania, it felt more like a museum exhibit than a modern healthcare facility. The mahogany shelves, stained dark with age, were crammed with antique apothecary jars and dusty patent medicine bottles that Elias had never gotten around to throwing out. The air always carried a subtle scent of herbs and saccharine, a potent cocktail of the past. The original pressed tin ceiling was patched and peeling, and the linoleum floor had seen better days. In the corner, a vintage cash register, a brass behemoth with levers and chimes, served as a charming but entirely impractical decoration. Even the lighting, a combination of flickering fluorescent tubes and a single, warm-toned lamp behind the counter, contributed to the sense of stepping back in time. Outside, the town square was just beginning to stir. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee from the diner across the street wafted in through the cracks in the window, a comforting, familiar smell that was a welcome counterpoint to the anxious knot in Elias's stomach.
