## Story Opening:

The incessant hum, a high-pitched whine that burrowed into Bartholomew "Bart" Finchley's skull, was the soundtrack to his life. He’d learned to filter it out, to let it become white noise against which he conducted the complex symphony of his craft. Tonight, however, the hum felt different – sharper, almost frantic. He squinted at the oscilloscope, its green waveform a jittery mess, not the clean, rhythmic pulse he expected.

"Something ain't right," Bart muttered, adjusting the dial on his workbench lamp, a vintage Art Deco piece that cast a warm, amber glow across the cluttered room. He reached for his well-worn multimeter, its plastic casing cracked and held together with electrical tape. Another night, another potential gremlin lurking within the tangled circuitry of the antiquated radio he was nursing back to life.

## Setting:

Bart's workshop was crammed into the attic of his rambling Victorian house in Havenwood, Maine. Dust motes danced in the faint light filtering through the single dormer window, illuminating the room's organized chaos. Every inch of space seemed occupied by a radio – hulking cathedral radios with ornate wooden cabinets, sleek, chrome-plated models from the 1950s, and even a few early crystal sets that looked more like scientific instruments than entertainment devices. 

Shelves overflowed with vacuum tubes, resistors, capacitors, and rolls of colored wire. Open manuals lay scattered across the workbench, their pages dog-eared and stained with coffee. The air was thick with the scent of soldering flux, ozone, and the comforting, almost nostalgic aroma of aging electronics. Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune off the Atlantic, a constant companion to the static crackle that perpetually emanated from Bart's workspace. The attic was his sanctuary, a world where the past lived and breathed through the crackling voices of the airwaves. A world, tonight, that felt unsettlingly off-kilter.
