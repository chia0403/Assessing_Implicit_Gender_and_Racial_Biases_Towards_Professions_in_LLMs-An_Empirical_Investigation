## Opening:

The scent of lavender and disinfectant hung thick in the air, a familiar perfume that always managed to both soothe and irritate Eliza Maeve Hawthorne in equal measure. She smoothed down the front of her navy scrubs, a habit born of nervous energy, and adjusted the name tag that insisted she was “Eliza H., O.T.” as if anyone in the Sunhaven Rehabilitation Center didn't already know her by sight, smell, or the gentle but firm encouragement she dispensed like medicine. Outside, the relentless Florida sun beat down on the palm trees lining the drive, painting harsh shadows across the manicured lawn. But inside, the air conditioning hummed a constant, chilly hymn of recovery, a stark contrast to the often messy, painful, and ultimately triumphant process that unfolded within these walls. Today, triumph felt particularly distant.

## Setting:

Sunhaven Rehabilitation Center, nestled in the heart of coastal Florida, wasn't exactly a tropical paradise, despite its location. While the exterior boasted lush landscaping and cheerful pastel paint, the interior was decidedly more practical. Long hallways, painted a calming but undeniably sterile pale green, stretched away from the main lobby, lined with doors leading to patient rooms, therapy gyms, and offices. The main therapy gym, where Eliza spent most of her days, was a brightly lit space filled with a cacophony of sounds: the rhythmic whirring of exercise bikes, the encouraging shouts of therapists, the groans of patients pushing their limits, and the sometimes mournful, sometimes hopeful strains of music playing softly in the background. Equipment lined the walls: parallel bars gleamed under fluorescent lights, resistance bands hung in colorful rows, and a mountain of specialized tools designed to rebuild strength, mobility, and independence stood ready for use. It was a place of constant motion, a workshop of resilience, and Eliza Hawthorne, Occupational Therapist, was one of its master craftspeople.
