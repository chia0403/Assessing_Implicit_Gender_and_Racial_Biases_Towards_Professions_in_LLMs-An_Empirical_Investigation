## The Whispering Pines Trailer Park, Dawn's Gray Light

The first hint of dawn was a pale, reluctant gray seeping through the gaps in the threadbare curtains of Trailer 7. It wasn't enough to chase away the shadows clinging to the corners of the cramped living room, but it was enough to reveal the dust motes dancing in the air, stirred by the restless shifting of a miniature schnauzer named Captain Pickles.

Outside, the Whispering Pines Trailer Park was just starting to stir. A rusty pickup coughed to life somewhere down the lane, the engine's roar quickly fading as it lumbered out onto County Road 12. A screen door slammed shut, followed by the sharp yapping of a different, less discerning dog. The smells of burnt coffee and stale cigarette smoke already hung heavy in the air, a familiar and unwelcome aroma for the residents, and for **Anya Marie Petrova**, emergency medical technician and reluctant early riser.

Anya groaned, her eyes still gritty with sleep, and pushed herself up in the dented La-Z-Boy chair. Her back protested with a symphony of pops and creaks. Twenty-four-hour shifts were starting to take their toll. She ran a hand through her tangled, dark brown hair, the remnants of last night's braid falling free. The faint scent of antiseptic and diesel fuel still clung to her skin, a constant reminder of her job.

She glanced at the digital clock on the microwave: 5:47 AM. Too early to get up properly, but too late to fall back asleep. Another day in Harper County, another day where anything could happen. And more often than not, in the Whispering Pines Trailer Park, it did.
