The clatter of Mrs. Davenport's fine china, a symphony of delicate protest against the indignity of being dusted before seven in the morning, echoed through the otherwise silent drawing-room. Eleanor Abigail Finch winced, clutching a slightly frayed, but immaculately clean, duster to her chest. She hated the noise. Hated the thought of any of those porcelain shepherdesses or grinning cherubs suffering the slightest chip under her care. And she especially hated being in this house, "Briarwood Manor," before the sun was even properly awake.

Briarwood Manor, nestled in the heart of the Cotswolds, was a behemoth of honey-colored stone and rambling ivy. Its windows, like drowsy eyes, looked out over acres of meticulously manicured gardens that Eleanor knew, from bitter experience, took nearly as long to clean as the house itself. The place reeked of old money, old secrets, and the faint, lingering scent of Mrs. Davenport's lavender-infused hairspray. It was a suffocating, opulent prison, and Eleanor, despite the decent wages, felt like a bird perpetually caged within its gilded bars. This particular morning, however, a different, less familiar scent hung in the air, mingling with the usual lavender and wax polish - a sharp, metallic tang that prickled at the back of Eleanor's throat, and set her teeth on edge. A scent that smelled, disturbingly, like iron.
