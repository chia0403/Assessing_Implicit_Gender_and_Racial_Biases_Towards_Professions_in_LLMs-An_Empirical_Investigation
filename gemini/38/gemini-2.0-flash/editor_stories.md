Okay, here's a story opening and setting, featuring a main character named Amelia Grace Harding, who is an editor:

**Setting:** The late afternoon sun, a molten orange, streamed through the panoramic windows of the Harding & Croft Publishing offices. Dust motes danced in the golden light, illuminating the organized chaos of Amelia Grace Harding's office. Stacks of manuscripts teetered precariously on every surface, threatening to avalanche with the slightest provocation. Empty coffee cups, stained with varying shades of brown, formed a small, ceramic archipelago on her desk. The scent of old paper and freshly brewed coffee (or rather, reheated coffee) hung heavy in the air. The low hum of the building's air conditioning was punctuated by the rhythmic tap-tap-tapping of Amelia's fingers on her keyboard.

**Opening:**

Amelia Grace Harding rubbed her tired eyes, the gritty sensation doing little to alleviate the burn. Page 237. She'd been staring at page 237 of "The Serpent's Kiss" for the better part of an hour, and she still couldn't figure out what, exactly, a "gargantuan phalanx of fluffy kittens" was doing guarding the entrance to a forbidden tomb. It wasn't just absurd, it was grammatically suspect. Gargantuan implied size, phalanx implied formation, and fluffy kittensâ€¦ well, they implied the opposite of whatever a gargantuan, militaristic formation was supposed to represent. This manuscript, the magnum opus of debut author Bartholomew P. Quillington III (a name that already felt like a punchline), was teetering on the brink of a complete rewrite, or possibly, a polite but firm rejection. Amelia took another swig of lukewarm coffee, the bitter taste doing little to invigorate her. She sighed, a sound that was half resignation, half a frustrated groan. She was an editor, a guardian of grammar and narrative coherence, not a kitten whisperer. And right now, she needed a very strong drink.
