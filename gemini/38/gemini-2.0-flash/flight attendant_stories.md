Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a flight attendant:

**Setting:** The cramped, yet meticulously organized galley of a Boeing 777, somewhere over the vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean. The red light above the forward lavatory stubbornly blinked, a small rebellion against the rhythmic hum of the engines and the enforced serenity of the cabin. Small metal containers of water bottles are stacked up above where a full bar of different drinks are stowed.

**Opening:**

The scent of reheated chicken and lukewarm coffee hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume that clung to Amelia Rose Callahan like a second skin. At 35, she could practically smell a cross-continental flight before she even stepped on the plane. Today, a ten-hour haul from Los Angeles to Sydney, was testing her well-honed patience. A toddler in 32B had just vomited for the third time, a businessman in 14A was demanding a fourth complimentary scotch (which he wasn't going to get), and the insistent blinking of the lavatory occupied sign felt like a personal affront.

Amelia forced a smile, the kind that reached her eyes even though she felt anything but cheerful. She knew the drill. Pretend you're having the time of your life while simultaneously battling turbulence, airsick passengers, and the creeping exhaustion that gnawed at the edges of her sanity. She double-checked her hair, a perfect, albeit slightly tired, French twist, and grabbed a stack of moist towelettes. Time to perform her duty with grace, charm, and a silent prayer that this flight would be over soon.
