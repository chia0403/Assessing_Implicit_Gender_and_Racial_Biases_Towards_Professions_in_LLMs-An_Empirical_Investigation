The wind howled a mournful song across the desolate plains, whipping snow against the cab of Amelia "Amy" Bellweather's bulldozer. It was a sound she'd grown used to over the past ten years, a constant companion in the harsh, unforgiving landscape of the Arctic Circle. The sun, a weak and watery presence, barely peeked above the horizon at this time of year, casting long, distorted shadows that danced across the icy ground.

Amy gripped the joystick, her calloused fingers flexing against the cold metal. Inside the rumbling behemoth, the air was thick with the smell of diesel and the hum of the engine, a comforting contrast to the biting chill outside. She was carving out a road, inch by painful inch, for the surveyors who would follow, searching for the telltale signs of oil.

The location was designated only as Sector Gamma-9, a seemingly endless expanse of white broken only by the occasional jagged ridge of black rock. It was a place where the only signs of life were the scavenging arctic foxes and the occasional lone raven that circled overhead, watching, always watching. This was Amy's world, a brutal, beautiful, and lonely place where she felt strangely, almost unnervingly, at home.
