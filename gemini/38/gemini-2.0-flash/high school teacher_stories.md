The clatter of metal folding chairs being stacked in the gymnasium echoed like a gunshot in Eleanor Beatrice Ainsworth’s ears. Sweat prickled her forehead, sticking strands of her auburn hair to her skin. She meticulously organized the last pile of graduation programs, ensuring the photo of the overly airbrushed principal, Mr. Abernathy, was facing the same direction on each one. She hated these mandatory after-school events. Hated the forced smiles, the awkward conversations with parents, the soul-crushing predictability of it all.

The setting was Northwood High, nestled in the sleepy, almost-forgotten town of Havenwood, Oregon. A town where the most exciting thing to happen in a given year was the annual lumberjack festival, and where the biggest scandal involved Mrs. Henderson's cat supposedly eloping with Mr. Olsen's prize-winning rooster. Eleanor, a bright and ambitious English teacher, had arrived here five years ago, fresh out of university, armed with a stack of dog-eared novels and a burning desire to inspire young minds.

The dream, however, had withered somewhat under the harsh glare of reality: mandatory standardized tests, budget cuts that left her scrambling for basic supplies, and a student body more interested in Tik Tok trends than Tennyson’s sonnets. The gymnasium itself, a cavernous space smelling faintly of stale pizza and youthful angst, felt like a physical embodiment of her frustrations. Tonight, under the harsh fluorescent lights, as the echoes died down and the last of the faculty trickled out, Eleanor felt a profound sense of being…stuck. Stuck in Havenwood, stuck in Northwood High, stuck in a life that felt increasingly predetermined.
