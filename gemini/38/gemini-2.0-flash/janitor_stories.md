Okay, here's a story opening and setting, including a main character named, let's say, Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins:

**Opening:**

The fluorescent lights of the OmniCorp Tower hummed a monotonous dirge, a sound Bart Higgins had grown to both resent and rely on. At 3:17 AM, it was the only sound that reliably broke the oppressive silence, a silence thick with the ghosts of mergers past and the unfulfilled ambitions of the employees who inhabited its glassy walls during the day. Bart paused, his worn mop suspended mid-swirl in the polished obsidian of the lobby floor. He'd been scrubbing the same dried coffee stain for five minutes. He sighed, a weary exhale that puffed a small cloud of vapor in the cool, perpetually-air-conditioned air. Some days, it felt like he was cleaning up more than just spills. He was cleaning up dreams.

**Setting:**

The OmniCorp Tower dominates the skyline of Neo-San Francisco, a chrome and glass behemoth that reflects the neon glow of the city back onto itself like a self-satisfied mirror. Inside, the tower is a labyrinth of cubicles, executive offices, and data centers, all humming with the low thrum of advanced technology. The building is meticulously clean, almost sterile, a testament to Bart and his crew's nightly efforts. The lower floors are open to the public, housing trendy cafes and tech showrooms, while the upper echelons are reserved for the elite, the C-suite executives and master programmers who dictate the city's technological future. The OmniCorp Tower is a symbol of progress and innovation, a glittering beacon of the future, but for Bart, it's just another floor to mop, another desk to dust, another stain to erase before the dawn breaks and the ambitious swarm back in.
