The last rays of a bruised, purple sunset bled across the fields of rye, painting the golden stalks in shades of deep crimson and somber grey. A chill, sharper than usual for early September, pricked at the exposed skin of Jedediah Bartholomew Finch, a farmer whose face was as weathered and lined as the soil he tilled. He leaned against the scarred tailgate of his battered Ford pickup, the engine ticking softly as it cooled, and watched the light fade.

Jedediah Finch, known as Jed to most folks (though his late wife, Martha, had always insisted on the full name on Sundays), was a man of the land, body and soul. He’d inherited Finch Farm from his father, and his father before him, each generation carving out a life from the unforgiving Nebraska prairie. Finch Farm wasn't much – a rambling, two-story farmhouse with peeling paint, a barn that sagged in the middle like a tired old man, and a hundred acres of arable land bordered by a creek that sometimes ran dry in the summer. But it was home. It was his life. And lately, it felt like it was slipping through his calloused fingers like grains of sand.
