Okay, here’s a story opening and setting, featuring a physical therapist as the main character:

**Opening:**

The scent of chlorine and disinfectant hung heavy in the air, a familiar but not entirely pleasant perfume to Dr. Eleanor Beatrice Albright. She suppressed a sneeze, adjusted her ponytail, and peered through the observation window of the therapy pool. Mrs. Petrov, bless her heart, was gamely attempting a breaststroke, her arthritic shoulders protesting with every hesitant glide. Eleanor mentally noted the grimace flickering across the older woman’s face and reached for her clipboard, ready to adjust the resistance jets down a notch. It was days like these, days filled with the aches and groans of aging bodies, the quiet triumphs and frustrating setbacks of recovery, that Eleanor felt the full weight of her chosen profession. And sometimes, she admitted, the full weight of her own life.

**Setting:**

The story takes place in the "Shoreline Wellness Center" in the small, coastal town of Port Blossom, Maine. The center is a relatively new facility, built in the Craftsman style with plenty of natural light and calming colors. It boasts a state-of-the-art therapy pool, a well-equipped gym with specialized rehabilitation equipment, several private treatment rooms, and a bright, welcoming reception area. Large windows throughout offer views of the rocky coastline and the perpetually crashing waves, a constant reminder of the strength and resilience of nature. Port Blossom itself is a quintessential New England town: quaint, a little weathered, and fiercely proud of its history and community. It's a place where everyone knows everyone, and word travels fast. The town's main industry is tourism, drawing visitors during the summer months who come to enjoy the beaches, fresh seafood, and charming local shops. In the off-season, the population dwindles, and the town becomes a quiet haven for its permanent residents, a close-knit group of fishermen, artisans, and retirees.
