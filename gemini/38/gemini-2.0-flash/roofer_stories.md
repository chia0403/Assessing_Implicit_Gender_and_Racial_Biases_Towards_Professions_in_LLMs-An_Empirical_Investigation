The tar paper shimmered under the relentless July sun, radiating heat that felt like a physical blow each time Elias Thorne shifted his weight. He adjusted his sweat-soaked bandana, wiping his brow with the back of a calloused hand, and squinted. Heâ€™d been staring at the same stretch of mottled grey shingles for the better part of three hours now, and the monotony was starting to gnaw at the edges of his concentration.

Elias Thorne, roofer, third generation, was perched precariously on the sloping roof of Mrs. Gable's Victorian gingerbread house in the sleepy, perpetually-sun-drenched town of Havenwood, Arizona. Havenwood, population 1,847, prided itself on its immaculate lawns, its prize-winning roses, and its charmingly antiquated architecture. The latter, unfortunately, meant a constant stream of leaky roofs and rotting eaves for Elias to mend.

Mrs. Gable's house was a particular beast. Built in 1898, it was a riot of turrets, dormers, and intricate fretwork, all painted a sickly sweet shade of lavender. The roof, a sprawling tapestry of mismatched shingles and haphazard repairs from previous, less-than-competent handymen, seemed to groan under the Arizona heat, as if daring him to find the source of the latest leak. Elias sighed, the metallic tang of exhaustion coating his tongue. He was only halfway through, and the promise of a cold beer at The Rusty Nail, Havenwood's only watering hole, seemed impossibly distant.
