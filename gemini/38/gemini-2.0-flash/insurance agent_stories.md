## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights of the office hummed, a soundtrack to Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins' mounting anxiety. Outside, the November wind howled against the plate glass window, rattling the blinds and mimicking the frantic rhythm in his chest. He gnawed on the end of his pen, the plastic already scarred with teeth marks, and stared blankly at the stack of denial letters threatening to topple off his desk.

Another one. Another family left to face the crushing weight of medical bills, lost income, and the grief he, Bartholomew Higgins, was supposed to alleviate. The irony was a bitter pill. He, the man whose job it was to shield people from life's financial storms, felt perpetually on the verge of drowning himself.

He closed his eyes, picturing his daughter, Lily, sketching fantastical creatures at their kitchen table. He'd promised her new art supplies, a promise tied to his performance bonus. A bonus that was looking increasingly like a distant mirage shimmering in the desert of rejected claims.

He sighed, the sound escaping his lips like a deflated balloon. "Come on, Bart," he muttered to himself, "chin up. There's gotta be one decent file in this whole godforsaken pile."

He reached for the top folder, his fingers trembling slightly. The name on the label was barely legible, scrawled in faded ink: "Elias Thorne."

## Setting:

**Interior:** The story opens in the cramped, utilitarian office of "SecureFuture Insurance," a mid-sized regional insurance company located on the third floor of a nondescript office building in the fictional town of Havenwood, Pennsylvania. The office space is generic and uninspired: beige walls, worn grey carpet, and rows of cubicles separated by particle board dividers. The air is stale and smells faintly of stale coffee and desperation. Bart's particular cubicle is slightly cluttered with stacks of paperwork, half-empty coffee mugs, and a framed photo of his daughter, Lily. The window behind his desk offers a bleak view of the town's parking lot and the perpetually overcast sky.

**Exterior:** Outside, Havenwood is a typical, struggling small town in Pennsylvania, grappling with economic decline and the fading glory of its once-thriving industrial past. The town is nestled in a valley surrounded by wooded hills, which are now bare and stark in the late fall. The wind whips through the streets, carrying with it the scent of damp leaves and wood smoke.
