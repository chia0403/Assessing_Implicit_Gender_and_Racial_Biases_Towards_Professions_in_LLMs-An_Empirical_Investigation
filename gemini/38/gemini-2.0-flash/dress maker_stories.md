Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a story with a dressmaker named Evangeline Marguerite Dubois as the main character:

**Setting:**

The setting is the quaint, historic town of Bellweather Cove, nestled on the rocky coast of Maine. The air is thick with the scent of salt and pine, and the cries of gulls are a constant chorus. The buildings are a charming mix of weathered clapboard and faded brick, many dating back to the town's whaling heyday. Bellweather Cove is a place where time seems to move a little slower, where secrets linger in the fog that rolls in off the sea, and where traditions are fiercely guarded. It's late October, just before Halloween, and the town is decorated with pumpkins and spooky decorations. The days are getting shorter, and the wind is colder, making the nights feel long and haunted.

**Opening:**

Evangeline Marguerite Dubois, needles flying with practiced ease, barely registered the shiver that ran down her spine. Not from the brisk October wind whipping through the cracks of her small storefront window, but from the unsettling feeling that had been clinging to her since sunrise. "Dubois' Designs", her simple sign proclaimed in elegant script, but today, inspiration felt as thin as the gossamer silk she was currently working with.

Evangeline paused, holding the shimmering fabric up to the light. It was for Mrs. Abernathy's daughter, a debutante dress for the Halloween Gala, a Bellweather Cove tradition dating back centuries. The girl wanted something "ethereal, with a hint of the gothic", and Evangeline, usually brimming with ideas, was drawing a blank. All she could see in the swirling, smoke-grey silk was a reflection of her own unease.

A raven landed on the window ledge, its dark eyes gleaming in the fading light. Evangeline jumped, pricking her finger on the needle. A tiny bead of blood blossomed on her fingertip, mirroring the ruby pendant that always hung around her neck, a gift from her grandmother. That unsettling feeling intensified, swirling around her like the autumn fog rolling in from the harbor. Something was coming to Bellweather Cove, something more than just the annual Halloween festivities. And Evangeline, with her keen eye and deep connection to the town's history, feared she was about to be caught in its thread.
