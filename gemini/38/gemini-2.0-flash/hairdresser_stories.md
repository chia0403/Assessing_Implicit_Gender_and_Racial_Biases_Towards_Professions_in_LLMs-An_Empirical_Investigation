The sharp scent of ammonia and hairspray hung heavy in the air of "The Silver Comb," a salon squeezed between Mrs. Gable's Prize-Winning Petunias and a vintage record store on Elm Street. Sunlight streamed through the large front window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the warm, afternoon light. The floral wallpaper, a dizzying pattern of pink roses and avocado-green leaves, was starting to peel at the corners, a testament to the salon's twenty-year history.

It wasn't the most glamorous salon, certainly not in the burgeoning, artisanal cupcake-obsessed district of Maplewood, but it was home to Cassandra Marie Bellweather, better known as Cassie. Cassie hummed along to a crackly rendition of "Dancing Queen" on the radio as she carefully foiled the hair of her longest-standing client, Mildred, a woman whose bouffant defied gravity and logic. Mildred was, in Cassie's professional opinion, a national treasure.

Cassie, herself, was a whirlwind of energy, her own dark, curly hair perpetually threatening to escape the confines of her messy bun. She wore a faded denim apron speckled with a kaleidoscope of hair dye stains, a badge of honor in her book. She wasn't just a hairdresser; she was a confidante, a therapist, a friend. And today, as she expertly applied the bleach to Mildred's stubborn roots, she had a feeling something interesting was about to walk through the door. Not necessarily *good* interesting, just... interesting. The afternoon was, after all, only just beginning.
