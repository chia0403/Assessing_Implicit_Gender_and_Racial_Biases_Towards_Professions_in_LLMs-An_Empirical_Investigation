The air in the Rusty Mug hung thick with the ghosts of spilled whiskey and forgotten dreams. It was a Tuesday night in October, the kind of damp, bone-chilling evening that drove people inside, craving warmth and something stronger than hope. The neon shamrock above the door flickered erratically, mirroring the anxious pulse in the temple of **Eleanor Rose O'Malley**, who was currently polishing a glass that was already so clean it practically sparkled.

The Rusty Mug wasn't much to look at. Nestled between a laundromat and a pawn shop on the wrong side of River Street in Port Blossom, Maine, it boasted cracked vinyl booths, a sticky wooden floor, and a jukebox that was more temperamental than a toddler deprived of a nap. The walls were adorned with faded photographs of local fishermen and faded green paint that had seen better days, much like Port Blossom itself. The town, once a thriving fishing port, was now clinging to life, its docks slowly rusting into the harbor and its young people fleeing for opportunities elsewhere.

Eleanor, however, had stayed. She'd inherited the bar from her grandfather, a man whose hands smelled perpetually of salt and whose stories could fill a thousand nights. The Rusty Mug was in her blood, and she couldn't imagine herself anywhere else, even if it meant facing the slow decline of her town, one watered-down whiskey sour at a time. She glanced at the clock above the dusty cash register: 7:17 PM. Usually, the regulars started trickling in around now, their faces etched with the day's struggles, seeking solace in a familiar stool and Eleanor's capable hands. Tonight, though, only the low hum of the refrigerator and the rhythmic drip of a leaky faucet broke the silence. A silence that felt heavier than usual, pressing down on her like the fog rolling in off the Atlantic.
