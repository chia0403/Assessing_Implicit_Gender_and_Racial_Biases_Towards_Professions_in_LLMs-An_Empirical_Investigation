## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The humid, sticky air of a late August evening hung heavy over Cypress Bend, Louisiana. Mosquitoes buzzed with a frenzied energy, drawn to the flickering porch light of the St. Claire Animal Clinic. Spanish moss, thick and grey, dripped from the ancient oaks that lined the quiet street, casting long, dancing shadows. The scent of honeysuckle and damp earth mingled with the faintly medicinal aroma emanating from the clinic's open doorway.

**Opening:**

Dr. Evangeline "Evie" St. Claire sighed, running a hand through her already messy auburn braid. The faint twang of a country song drifted from the radio in the next room, a melody she'd heard a thousand times. She stared at the X-ray, the skeletal image of a raccoon's mangled paw glowing a ghostly white against the darkened screen. "Well, Maisie," she muttered to the sleepy calico curled on the counter, "looks like we're pulling an all-nighter." The cat blinked slowly, unimpressed. Evie knew what she had to do, and as much as she dreaded the intricate microsurgery ahead, the thought of leaving the poor creature in pain was simply unbearable. She grabbed her surgical gloves, the familiar scent of latex a comfort in the quiet solitude of the clinic. Just another Tuesday in Cypress Bend. Just another life to save.
