**Setting:**

The unforgiving, wind-whipped plains of central Montana. The year is 1934, deep in the heart of the Dust Bowl. The sky, usually a brilliant sapphire, is perpetually stained a sickly orange-brown, thick with choking dust that seeps into every crack and crevice. The small town of Dust Creek, a collection of dilapidated wooden buildings huddled around a rusting grain elevator, is clinging desperately to survival. The only escape, both literally and figuratively, is the sky.

**Opening:**

Amelia "Amy" Beatrice Davies adjusted her goggles, the leather rough against her chapped cheeks. The engine of her battered biplane, a Curtiss JN-4 "Jenny" she affectionately called "Dust Devil," sputtered and coughed, threatening to stall before she even left the ground. Amy felt a bead of sweat trickle down her temple, mingling with the grime that perpetually clung to her skin. Another bad storm was brewing. She could taste the grit in the air, a coppery tang that presaged the blinding fury to come.

"Come on, old girl," she muttered to the plane, patting the worn wooden fuselage. "Just one more run. We need to get that medicine to the Olsen farm before this damn dust swallows everything whole."

She glanced over at Jedediah "Jed" Olsen, his face etched with worry as he stood beside her. His farm, like so many others in Dust Creek, was barely clinging to life. A cough racked his body, a sound that mirrored the failing engine.

"You sure about this, Amy?" Jed asked, his voice hoarse. "Storm's comin' in fast. Maybe we should wait."

Amy shook her head, her jaw set. "Waiting won't make this any easier, Jed. Besides," she added with a wry smile, "Dust Devil and I are old hands at fighting the wind."

She gripped the throttle, pulling it back slowly. The engine roared to life, a defiant shout against the desolate landscape. Amy braced herself, her heart pounding in her chest. It was time to take to the sky, to gamble against the elements, and to try, just one more time, to snatch a small victory from the jaws of despair. The Dust Devil rumbled down the makeshift airstrip, kicking up a cloud of red dirt, and soared, however briefly, above the suffocating grip of the Dust Bowl.
