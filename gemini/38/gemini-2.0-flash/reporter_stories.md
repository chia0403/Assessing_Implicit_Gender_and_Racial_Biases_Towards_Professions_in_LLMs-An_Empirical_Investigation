The biting wind, smelling of salt and something indefinably ancient, whipped around Eleanor Vance, tugging at the scarf knotted beneath her chin. She hunched deeper into her thick wool coat, pulling it tighter against the pre-dawn chill that permeated the small fishing village of Port Blossom. The slate-grey sky threatened rain, mirroring the somber mood clinging to the town like the persistent fog rolling in from the Atlantic.

Eleanor, a seasoned reporter for the "Coastal Gazette," usually thrived in the chaos of a breaking story, the adrenaline pumping through her veins as she chased down leads and pieced together the truth. But Port Blossom felt different, heavier. The air itself seemed thick with secrets. She’d arrived late the night before, the last ferry groaning its way into the harbor under a shroud of mist. The few locals she’d encountered at the deserted pub had offered only clipped answers and wary glances, their faces etched with a mixture of grief and something else… something that felt distinctly like fear.

The story, at least on paper, was straightforward enough. A local fisherman, a man named Silas Blackwood, had gone missing three weeks ago. Initially dismissed as another unfortunate accident in a dangerous profession, the case had taken a darker turn with the discovery of his boat, adrift and empty, its nets untouched. Eleanor had caught wind of whispers of old legends, of strange lights seen on the water, and a lingering unease that pointed to something far more sinister than a simple maritime tragedy. And Eleanor Vance, always drawn to the mysteries that lurked beneath the surface of everyday life, had packed her bags and braved the relentless November winds to uncover the truth of what happened to Silas Blackwood.
