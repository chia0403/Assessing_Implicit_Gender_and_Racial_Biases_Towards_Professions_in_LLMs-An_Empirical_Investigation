## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The salt-laced wind whipped through Port Blossom, a quaint coastal town clinging to the jagged cliffs of the Oregon coast. The air, thick with the scent of pine and the cries of gulls, hung heavy over the cobblestone streets. In the heart of town, nestled between a weathered bookstore and a seafood shack, stood "The Wild Bloom," its vibrant window display a cheerful contrast to the grey, overcast sky.

**Opening:**

Eleanor Rose Thorne, her hands dusted with pollen and soil, squinted at the wilting stargazer lilies. They were usually so robust, so vibrantly pink. Today, they drooped like forgotten promises. "Come on, darlings," she murmured, adjusting the humidity gauge with a furrow in her brow. "What's got you so down?"

Outside, the rain started, a soft drizzle that slicked the cobblestones and reflected the neon glow of the "Open" sign hanging in her window. Eleanor loved the rain. It brought people in, seeking refuge and a splash of color in the grey monotony. But today, even the soothing rhythm of the rain couldn't shake the unease that had settled in her bones. Something feltâ€¦ off. She couldn't quite place it, but the lilies seemed to echo her premonition. A cold dread, like the approaching winter storms, was beginning to brew in the heart of The Wild Bloom.
