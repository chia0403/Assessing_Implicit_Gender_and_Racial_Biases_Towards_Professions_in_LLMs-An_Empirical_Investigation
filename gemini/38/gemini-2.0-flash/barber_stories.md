The afternoon sun, heavy with the scent of roasting chestnuts and exhaust fumes, slanted through the frosted glass of the "Sweeney Todd Barber Shop & Razor Emporium" sign, casting a warm, blurry glow on the linoleum floor. Inside, the air hung thick with the familiar aroma of bay rum, stale cigarette smoke, and the quiet anticipation of a good, old-fashioned shave. Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light illuminating the waiting area, where a worn leather armchair sat empty, silently absorbing the radio crooning a tinny rendition of "White Christmas."

Behind the scarred counter, meticulously polishing a straight razor with a worn leather strop, stood Bartholomew Reginald Abernathy, a man who considered himself a craftsman in the purest sense of the word. He wasn't just cutting hair, he was sculpting it, shaping not just a man's appearance, but his confidence, his outlook, his very place in the unforgiving grayscape of 1950s London. Bartholomew, with his neatly trimmed mustache, his sharp eyes perpetually magnified behind thick spectacles perched on the bridge of his long, aristocratic nose, and his crisp white barber's coat that spoke of meticulousness rather than cleanliness, was a fixture on Fleet Street, a monument to tradition in a rapidly changing world. He straightened his spine, a flicker of impatience crossing his face. His 2:00 PM appointment was late. Again.
