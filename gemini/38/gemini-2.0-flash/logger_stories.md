Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a logger named:

**Character Name:** Silas "Si" Blackwood

**Setting:** The rugged, rain-soaked Olympic Peninsula of Washington State, specifically in the year 1957.

**Story Opening:**

The whine of Silas Blackwood’s chainsaw sliced through the morning mist like a hungry wolf through fog. The air, thick enough to chew, tasted of pine sap, damp earth, and the metallic tang of his own sweat. Each vibration of the roaring engine seemed to shake the ancient forest, sending droplets cascading from the towering Sitka spruces and Douglas firs that formed a cathedral around him. Si wrestled the saw around the base of a giant, its trunk easily ten feet across. He’d been logging this section of the Blackwood family land for twenty years now, ever since his father had succumbed to the damp and a bad case of pneumonia. Twenty years of the same smells, the same backache, the same relentless rhythm of steel biting into wood. Twenty years of knowing, deep in his bones, that every tree he felled brought him closer to financial security, and yet further from something he couldn't quite name. Today, though, felt different. The air was heavier, the silence between the saw’s roars punctuated by a disquieting lack of birdsong. Si paused, shutting off the chainsaw. The sudden silence was deafening. He wiped the grime from his brow with the back of a calloused hand and listened. The only sound now was the drip, drip, drip of water falling from the towering branches, each drop echoing in the oppressive stillness like a secret whispered from the heart of the ancient woods. Something was wrong. Terribly, unnervingly wrong.
