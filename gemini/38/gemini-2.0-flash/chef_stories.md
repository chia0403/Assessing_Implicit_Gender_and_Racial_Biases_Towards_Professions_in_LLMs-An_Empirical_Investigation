The clatter of pans was a familiar lullaby to Beatrice Eleanor Moreau, even at 3:00 AM. The industrial kitchen of "Le Fleur Sauvage," usually a symphony of controlled chaos, was eerily silent save for the rhythmic thud of her cleaver against the heavy wooden cutting board. Outside, Paris slept, a city dreaming of romance and flaky croissants, unaware that Beatrice was battling a far less palatable demon: her sourdough starter.

Le Fleur Sauvage, nestled on a cobbled street just off the Place des Vosges, was a haven of rustic elegance. The dining room boasted exposed brick walls draped with climbing ivy, mismatched antique chairs upholstered in velvet, and a zinc bar that had seen more confessions than a Parisian confessional box. Sunlight, when it dared to peek through the perpetually overcast Parisian sky, streamed through the large windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and the happy faces of patrons savoring Beatrice's creations. At least, that was the story during daylight hours. Now, under the harsh fluorescent lights of the kitchen, the restaurant felt less like a fairytale and more like a pressure cooker.

Beatrice, a woman whose hands seemed more comfortable kneading dough than holding a pen, squinted at the bubbling, greyish mass in the glass jar. "Damn it, Gerard," she muttered, addressing the unruly starter as if it were a petulant child. This batch, named in a fit of romantic optimism after the baker who first taught her the secrets of sourdough, was proving to be anything but cooperative. Tomorrow was Bastille Day, the busiest day of the year for Le Fleur Sauvage, and she needed perfect, crusty baguettes, not this... this sour, unyielding mess. The fate of the restaurant, and her reputation, might just hang in the balance.
