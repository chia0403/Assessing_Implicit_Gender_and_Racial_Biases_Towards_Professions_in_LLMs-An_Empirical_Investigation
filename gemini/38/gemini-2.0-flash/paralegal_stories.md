The fluorescent lights of the 27th floor hummed, casting a sterile glow across Amelia Rose Davies' meticulously organized desk. From her perch, she could see the sprawling metropolis of Chicago stretching out, a concrete and glass tapestry shimmering under the morning sun. But Amelia wasn't looking. She was staring, instead, at the stack of affidavits that threatened to topple over, each one a tiny brick in the wall of the looming O'Malley v. GlobalTech lawsuit.

Amelia Rose Davies, paralegal extraordinaire at the prestigious law firm of Harding & Sterling, felt a familiar knot tighten in her stomach. It was a Tuesday morning, a typically chaotic Tuesday morning, and she was already behind schedule. This was her third year at Harding & Sterling and, despite the prestige and the decent (for a paralegal) paycheck, she knew deep down that her soul was slowly being vacuumed out by the soul-sucking machine that was corporate law.

The office, a monument to modern minimalist design, was all glass and steel, punctuated by pops of expensive art that Amelia secretly thought looked like spilled paint. The silence, normally punctuated by the rhythmic tap-tap-tapping of keyboards and hushed phone calls, felt particularly oppressive this morning. It was the kind of quiet that preceded a storm, a storm of billable hours and demanding partners, and Amelia Rose Davies felt herself bracing for impact.
