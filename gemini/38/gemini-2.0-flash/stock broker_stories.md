Okay, here's a story opening and setting:

**Story Opening:**

The last tendrils of dawn were clawing their way through the canyons of Midtown Manhattan as Arthur Benedict Sterling IV, a man who habitually woke before even the roaches, adjusted the knot of his Herm√®s tie. It was a shade of robin's egg blue, a calculated flash of preppy rebellion against the grey conformity of Wall Street. He took a final swig of lukewarm coffee from his paper cup, the bitter liquid a necessary fuel for the day ahead. He needed to be sharp, predatory even. Today, Arthur was hunting.

**Setting:**

The story begins in the opulent, yet surprisingly sterile, lobby of Sterling Investment Group, a privately owned stock brokerage firm located on the 47th floor of a mirrored skyscraper on Park Avenue. The air is thick with the subtle, expensive scent of sandalwood and the faint hum of the building's ventilation system. Gleaming marble floors reflect the muted light filtering through floor-to-ceiling windows, offering a panoramic view of the awakening city. The lobby is sparsely furnished: a low, angular sofa upholstered in charcoal leather, a minimalist glass coffee table displaying art books on abstract expressionism, and a polished steel reception desk manned by a perpetually bored-looking woman named Tiffany, who, despite Arthur's best efforts to elicit a smile, remained stoically indifferent to his charm. The overall atmosphere is one of quiet power, a testament to the wealth and influence that resides within.
