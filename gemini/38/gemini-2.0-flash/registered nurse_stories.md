## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The humid air hung thick and heavy over Charity Hospital, New Orleans, Louisiana. It was August, a time when the city seemed to exhale sweat and the ancient bones of the French Quarter groaned under the weight of the heat. The fluorescent lights of the Emergency Room buzzed with a frantic energy, a stark contrast to the lethargic pace of the afternoon outside. The air smelled of antiseptic, stale coffee, and something vaguely metallic, a cocktail unique to the chaos and heartbreak that perpetually pulsed within these walls.

**Story Opening:**

The insistent shriek of the ambulance siren cut through the din of the ER, followed by the frantic crackle of the dispatcher’s voice over the radio. "ETA two minutes, possible GSW to the chest. Unconscious, unstable…"

Dr. Landry barked orders, but it was registered nurse, Eleanor Rose Beaumont, who moved with the practiced efficiency of a well-oiled machine. She laid out the crash cart, her gloved hands moving instinctively. Eleanor, or Ellie as she preferred to be called, had seen too much tragedy walk, or more often, be wheeled, through these doors. She’d learned to compartmentalize, to steel herself against the tide of trauma that threatened to engulf her. But tonight, a gnawing unease prickled at the back of her neck. A feeling, sharp and unwelcome, that this was just the beginning of something bigger, something more. She just hoped she was wrong.
