## Story Opening:

The rhythmic clatter of cutlery against china was Beatrice Anya Moreau's lullaby. It was a sound that usually soothed her, a white noise against the cacophony of her own thoughts. But tonight, the symphony of service felt like a personal assault. Each scrape, each clink, each forced pleasantry grated on her nerves, amplifying the ache in her feet and the knot in her stomach. She could smell the lobster bisque from Table Six, a sickeningly rich aroma that clung to the air like a persistent, unwelcome guest. Tonight, even the scent of money couldn't mask the bitter taste of desperation.

## Setting:

"Le Fleur d'Or," or "The Golden Flower," was a Parisian restaurant bathed in the warm glow of amber lighting and hushed expectation. Located on a quiet, cobbled side street in the Marais district, it catered to a clientele that valued elegance and discretion. Think polished silver, starched linen, and waiters who knew your order before you even sat down. The walls were painted a soft, creamy white, adorned with original artwork by local artists. Outside, flickering gas lamps cast long shadows, adding to the restaurant's romantic and somewhat exclusive atmosphere. Le Fleur d'Or was a place where secrets were whispered, deals were made, and fortunes were both won and lost, all under the watchful eye of Beatrice and her fellow servers.
