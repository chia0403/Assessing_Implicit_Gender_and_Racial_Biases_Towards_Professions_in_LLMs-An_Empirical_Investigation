## Story Opening & Setting:

**Opening:**

The clatter of bone meeting cleaver was as familiar to Elias Thorne as the rhythm of his own heart. He didn't even need to look as his practiced hand guided the heavy blade, splitting the lamb shoulder with a clean, satisfying *thwack*. A fine spray of marrow dust settled on his already flour-dusted apron, a testament to the hours he'd already spent wrestling with carcasses this morning. But today, the familiar comforting rhythm felt…hollow. A discordance. He couldn’t quite place it, but a prickle of unease skittered down his spine. Maybe it was the storm gathering outside, the slate-grey sky pressing down on the village like a heavy lid. Or maybe, Elias thought, grimly, it was Mrs. Higgins' request for a particularly lean cut of pork, delivered with that knowing smirk that always made him feel like he was being judged.

**Setting:**

The story unfolds in the quaint, often-damp village of Oakhaven, nestled deep in the rolling hills of North Yorkshire. Oakhaven clings stubbornly to tradition, its cobblestone streets lined with half-timbered houses that have weathered centuries. Life revolves around the village green, the church bell that chimes the hour, and the local businesses: Mrs. Periwinkle’s tea shop, the "Drunken Duck" pub, and, of course, Thorne's Family Butchers. The shop itself, passed down through generations of Thorne men, is a haven of polished wood, gleaming steel, and the rich, earthy scent of fresh meat. Strings of sausages hang from the rafters, alongside hams cured with Elias’s grandfather’s secret recipe. A large, hand-painted sign above the door depicts a proud bull, its slogan proclaiming: "Thorne's: Quality You Can Taste." Despite its rustic charm, Oakhaven harbours a quiet undercurrent of secrets, whispered in hushed tones over pints of ale and guarded jealously by its long-term residents. And Elias, despite being a lifelong inhabitant, often feels like an outsider looking in, a butcher in a town that increasingly prefers the convenience of the supermarket over the honest work of a craftsman.
