The late afternoon sun, already beginning its fiery descent behind the sandstone cliffs, cast long, skeletal shadows across the cluttered office of Professor Dr. Alistair Quentin Humphrey. Dust motes danced in the golden light filtering through the single, grime-streaked window, illuminating stacks of haphazardly piled books, ancient tomes with cracked spines and fraying pages. Half-eaten crumpets, left from a hastily consumed breakfast, lay fossilized on a chipped saucer amidst scattered academic journals and a half-finished crossword puzzle.

Alistair, a man whose tweed jacket looked as though it had absorbed the very essence of the Oxford library he called home, squinted at the faded map spread across his oak desk. His thinning, silver hair was perpetually dishevelled, escaping the confines of a comb's influence hours ago. The map, brittle and yellowed with age, depicted the unexplored regions of Bhutan, circa 1890. Its hand-drawn contours hinted at forgotten trails and the whispered legends of mythical creatures. Alistair, a professor of comparative mythology and obscure Himalayan folklore, had been chasing these whispers for the better part of his adult life.
