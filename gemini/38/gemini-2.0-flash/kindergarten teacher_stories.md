The squeak of rubber soles against the linoleum floor was Amelia Willowbrook's daily symphony, a melody she usually found charming, even comforting. But this morning, it grated. The bright, artificial sunshine streaming through the oversized windows of the "Rainbow Room" kindergarten class at Willow Creek Elementary did nothing to dispel the gray cloud hanging over her head. It wasn't the sticky fingers, the misplaced glue sticks, or the endless stream of "Miss Amelia, he's looking at me!" that was bothering her. No, it was the looming parent-teacher conferences scheduled for the next day, and one parent in particular: Bartholomew "Bart" Butterfield. 

Amelia sighed, smoothing down her floral-print dress for probably the tenth time. The Rainbow Room was a kaleidoscope of five-year-old artwork: crayon rainbows, glitter-glued sunflowers, and construction paper self-portraits that ranged from eerily accurate to gloriously abstract. Sunlight dappled across the alphabet rug, scattered with tiny plastic dinosaurs engaged in an epic battle of extinction. Outside, the crisp autumn air hinted at the approaching holidays, but inside, Amelia felt a knot of dread tightening in her stomach. Bart Butterfield was notorious for his complaints, his nitpicking, and his uncanny ability to find fault where others saw only the innocent chaos of childhood. This year, he had promised a "thorough evaluation" of his daughter, Beatrice's, progress, and Amelia, for the first time in her five years of teaching, felt genuinely unprepared.
