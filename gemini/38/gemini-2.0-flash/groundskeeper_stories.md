## Story Opening:

The first scent of the day, as always, was dew-soaked grass and the faint, earthy undertones of decaying leaves. For Jedidiah Bartholomew Finch, it was the most honest and comforting perfume he knew. He inhaled deeply, letting the crisp morning air fill his lungs, a welcome counterpoint to the ever-present ache in his lower back. He straightened, wincing slightly, and surveyed his domain. 

## Setting:

Jedidiah Bartholomew Finch was the head groundskeeper of Pemberley Gardens, a sprawling, meticulously-maintained estate located in the heart of the Cotswolds, England. Not *the* Pemberley Gardens, of course. This was a much humbler affair, owned by the eccentric and reclusive Ms. Eleanor Thorne. Think of it as Pemberley’s slightly-less-famous, but arguably more charming, younger sister.

The gardens themselves were a patchwork of perfectly manicured lawns, overflowing rose bushes, and carefully sculpted hedges. A babbling brook, fed by a natural spring, meandered through the grounds, culminating in a small, lily-pad adorned pond. Beyond the formal gardens, a wilder, more untamed area stretched towards the ancient woodland bordering the property – a haven for wildlife and, on occasion, Jedidiah’s own quiet contemplation. It was a place of peace, beauty, and a relentless need for weeding.
