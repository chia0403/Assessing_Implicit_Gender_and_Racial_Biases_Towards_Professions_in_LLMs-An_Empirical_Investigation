The clock above the oven ticked with a deliberate, mocking rhythm, each tick a tiny hammer blow against Amelia Bellwether's patience. Flour dusted her apron like a fresh snowfall, and the aroma of baking bread hung heavy in the air, a comforting fragrance that tonight felt more like a suffocating blanket. Outside, the October wind howled, rattling the windows of "Amelia's Sweet Surrender," her little bakery nestled on the edge of Havenwood Forest.

Havenwood itself was a town steeped in folklore, where the leaves turned crimson with an almost unnatural intensity, and the locals whispered tales of ancient magic lurking amongst the trees. Amelia, a practical woman by nature, usually dismissed these stories as the ramblings of bored townsfolk. But tonight, the wind seemed to carry more than just leaves; it carried a prickling unease, a sense that something was amiss.

She was late. Ridiculously, unforgivably late with the Harvest Moon cake, a three-tiered masterpiece of pumpkin spice and maple buttercream, the centerpiece for the annual Havenwood celebration. A celebration, she reminded herself sternly, that would be considerably less festive if she didn't manage to pull this cake out of the oven in the next ten minutes. Amelia wiped a bead of sweat from her brow with the back of her flour-dusted hand and tried to ignore the unsettling feeling that was slowly crawling under her skin. It was just the wind, she told herself. Just the wind... and a very late cake.
