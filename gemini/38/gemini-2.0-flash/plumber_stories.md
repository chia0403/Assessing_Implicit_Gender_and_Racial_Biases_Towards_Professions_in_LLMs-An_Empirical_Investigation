The air in the old Victorian house hung thick and heavy with the scent of mildew and regret. Rain lashed against the stained-glass windows, mimicking the relentless drumming in Elias Theodore Blackwood's skull. He knelt in the cramped crawlspace beneath the kitchen sink, the beam of his headlamp cutting a swathe through the dust and cobwebs. A colony of spiders scattered at his intrusion, their delicate webs swaying like miniature hammocks in the humid air.

Elias sighed, the sound swallowed by the groaning plumbing that was his nemesis for the evening. Mrs. Higgins, a woman whose voice could curdle milk, had called in a panic. "Burst pipe, Mr. Blackwood! Burst pipe! It's ruining my antique linoleum!"

Antique linoleum. Just his luck. Elias wasn't just a plumber; he was a craftsman, a problem-solver, a master of the wrench. But he wasn't an art restorer. And he definitely wasn't eager to spend another minute in this suffocating purgatory beneath the house at 13 Blackthorn Lane. The house itself seemed to exhale a palpable sense of unease. He could almost feel the ghosts of generations past, whispering complaints about leaky faucets and dripping pipes. Tonight, however, their spectral woes were overshadowed by the very real prospect of water damage and the wrath of Mrs. Higgins. He adjusted his headlamp, its beam flickering across the corroded copper pipes, and muttered, "Alright, you wretched leak. Let's see what you're made of."
