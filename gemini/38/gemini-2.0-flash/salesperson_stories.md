## The Story Opening & Setting:

The neon sign outside "Lucky's Used RVs" buzzed a sickly green, humming a low, persistent drone that matched the hum of anxiety thrumming in Theodore Bartholomew Finch's chest. He tugged at the collar of his already-too-tight polyester shirt, the humid Georgia air clinging to him like a shroud. It was August, and even under the relative shade of the RV awnings, the asphalt shimmered with heat.

Theodore Bartholomew Finch, Top Salesman (according to Lucky, anyway, who was known to embellish), nervously smoothed back his thinning hair, a futile gesture against the relentless breeze that perpetually stirred up dust devils in the gravel lot. He’d been staring at the dusty windows of the "Big Bertha" – a monstrous 36-foot Winnebago with questionable shag carpeting and a history older than Theodore himself – for the last twenty minutes, trying to conjure the perfect sales pitch.

He knew what he *should* say. He knew the benefits of owning an RV – the freedom, the adventure, the unparalleled access to America's natural beauty. He’d recited them a thousand times, each syllable polished and perfected.

But today, Theodore felt like a rusty cog in a machine that had long since broken down. The weight of his dwindling commissions, his nagging wife Gladys, and the looming threat of his rapidly encroaching mid-life crisis felt heavier than the Big Bertha herself.

The door to the RV swung open with a creak, and a woman emerged, shielding her eyes from the harsh sunlight. Theodore recognized her. She'd been browsing the lot for the past hour, her face etched with a mixture of fascination and skepticism.

This was it. His chance to turn the tide. Theodore took a deep breath, plastered on his most sincere smile, and began to walk towards her, the gravel crunching under his worn leather shoes.

“Well, good afternoon, ma’am! I’m Theodore Bartholomew Finch, and welcome to Lucky's Used RVs! Are you finding everything to your liking today?”
