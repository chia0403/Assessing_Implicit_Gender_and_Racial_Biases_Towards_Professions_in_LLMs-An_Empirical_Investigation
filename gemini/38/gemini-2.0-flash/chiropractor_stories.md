Okay, here's a story opening with a chiropractor named Dr. Elias Thorne as the main character, including the setting:

**Story Opening:**

The air in the waiting room of Thorne Chiropractic Clinic hung thick with the smell of peppermint and nervous anticipation. Rain hammered against the large bay window, blurring the already fading twilight into streaks of amber and grey. Dr. Elias Thorne, his tie loosened and his sleeves rolled up to reveal forearms etched with the faint lines of hours spent adjusting spines, watched the downpour with a sigh. He was running late, again, and the last patient of the day, Mrs. Higgins, always had a tale or two to tell, each one seemingly more intricate and time-consuming than the last. He rubbed the bridge of his nose, the scent of menthol from his muscle rub clinging to his fingers. He loved his work, truly, loved the feeling of restoring movement and alleviating pain. But some days, like today, the relentless demand, the constant listening, the pressure to be a healer and a confidant all at once, felt like a vise tightening around his chest.

He glanced at the framed diplomas on the wall: Logan University, a testament to years of study and sacrifice. Sometimes, staring at those faded documents felt more like a reminder of the idealistic young man he used to be, a man brimming with boundless energy and unwavering faith in his ability to fix the world, one vertebrae at a time. He pushed the feeling aside. Mrs. Higgins wouldn't appreciate existential angst when all she wanted was relief from her sciatica.

The muted chime of the reception bell announced her arrival. "Right on cue," Elias muttered under his breath, pasting a welcoming smile on his face. "Time to work some magic."

**Setting:**

The story opens in **Thorne Chiropractic Clinic**, located in the small, perpetually damp town of **Oakhaven, Oregon**.

*   **Oakhaven:** A former logging town, now struggling to redefine itself. Its main street is lined with a mix of antique shops, coffee houses, and businesses clinging to life. The surrounding landscape is dominated by towering Douglas firs and the ever-present murmur of the Willamette River. It’s a town where everyone knows everyone, and secrets are a commodity.

*   **Thorne Chiropractic Clinic:** The clinic is in a converted Victorian house. The waiting room is furnished with comfortable, mismatched armchairs and a worn Oriental rug. The color scheme is a calming palette of greens and blues, intended to evoke a sense of tranquility. However, the building's age is evident in its creaky floors, the faint musty scent that lingers in the air, and the occasional draft that sneaks in around the window frames. The clinic itself holds two adjustment rooms, an x-ray room, and Elias’s office. It is both his sanctuary and a constant reminder of the weight of his responsibilities.

I hope this is a good start for your story! Good luck!
