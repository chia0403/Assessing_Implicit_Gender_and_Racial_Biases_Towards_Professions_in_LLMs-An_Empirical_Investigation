Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a hair cutter named Augustina Violet Dubois:

**Setting:** A sweltering July afternoon in New Orleans' French Quarter. The air hung thick and heavy, a fragrant soup of jasmine, exhaust fumes, and the faint, metallic tang of the Mississippi River. Sunlight, relentless even through the tattered awning, beat down on "Scissors & Stilettos," a narrow, brightly painted salon nestled between a fortune teller's parlor and a beignet shop. Inside, the air was slightly cooler, thanks to a rattling window AC unit fighting a losing battle against the Louisiana heat. Mirrors lined the walls, reflecting a kaleidoscope of colorful wigs, vintage styling tools, and Augustina's quirky collection of Mardi Gras masks.

**Story Opening:**

Augustina Violet Dubois hummed along to the off-key saxophone solo wafting from a street performer outside as she meticulously sharpened her favorite pair of shears. The rhythmic *shick-shick-shick* was almost meditative, a familiar counterpoint to the chaos that often brewed within the walls of Scissors & Stilettos. Today, though, the salon was unusually quiet. The midday rush had come and gone, leaving behind only the ghosts of laughter and hairspray. Augustina glanced at the clock, its ornate hands frozen stubbornly at half-past two. She knew Madame Evangeline next door would be shaking her head, muttering about the unreliability of cheap battery-operated mechanisms. Augustina sighed, a tiny puff of breath that barely ruffled the stray curl that had escaped her vibrant purple headscarf. Business had been slow all week, a worrying trend that sent little pinpricks of anxiety dancing across her skin. Maybe she should finally take Madame Evangeline up on her offer of a tarot reading. Or, perhaps, just find someone willing to let her experiment with the new turquoise hair dye she'd been eyeing. At least that would bring a splash of color to this suffocating afternoon. The bell above the door jingled, startling her. A woman stood silhouetted in the doorway, her figure framed by the blinding sunlight. Augustina squinted, pushing the anxiety aside. Business, slow or not, was business. "Bonjour, madame," she called out, her voice lilting with a Creole accent. "Welcome to Scissors & Stilettos! What can I do for you today?"
