## The Story Opening:

The rhythmic scratch of graphite on vellum was the only sound that truly comforted Archibald Finch. It was a predictable, dependable sound, unlike the chaotic symphony of the city that clawed at the edges of his tenth-floor office. He was bent over his drafting table, the lamplight reflecting harshly off the chrome of his specialized rulers and setting tiny fires in the inkwells scattered across the surface.  His breath caught in his throat. The damn girder wouldn’t align. Again.

Archibald Finch, Junior, Senior Architectural Draftsman for the esteemed (and notoriously pedantic) firm of  Fitzwilliam, Hawthorne & Sons, pushed back his spectacles, the wire frames digging grooves into the bridge of his nose. He rubbed his tired eyes, which felt gritty and strained. He was on his fourth iteration of the structural support for the grand atrium of the new Municipal Arts Building, and Fitzwilliam, Hawthorne & Sons, or rather, Fitzwilliam *himself*, found fault with every single damn one.

"Too frivolous," Fitzwilliam had declared of the first. "Lacking in gravitas" of the second. The third, according to the man, was "simply inadequate." Archibald had refrained, with monumental effort, from replying that *Fitzwilliam* was simply inadequate. He sighed, the air heavy in his lungs, thick with the scent of paper dust, sweat, and quiet desperation. He’d been at this for eighteen hours straight, fuelled only by lukewarm coffee and the gnawing fear of losing his job. He just wanted the damn girder to *align*.

## The Setting:

Archibald's office, while technically part of a larger open-plan space occupied by other draftsmen and designers, felt like his own private, cramped world. It was located on the tenth floor of the Fitzwilliam, Hawthorne & Sons building, a towering edifice of grey stone that dominated the skyline of 1930s New York City.  The office itself was a study in utilitarian pragmatism, reflecting the firm's old-fashioned, no-nonsense approach to architecture.  

His drafting table, a sprawling, oak monstrosity with a tilting surface and various shelves and drawers, was the undisputed center of his domain. It was cluttered with tools of his trade: T-squares, set squares, compasses, protractors,  pencils of varying grades (meticulously sharpened), erasers worn down to nubbins, and stacks of blueprints and architectural journals.  

Surrounding the table were floor-to-ceiling shelves crammed with reference books, detailing the minutiae of classical design, building codes, and engineering principles.  A small window, grimy and slightly cracked, offered a panoramic view of the city's sprawling urban landscape, a stark contrast to the intricate detail of his work. It was a view he rarely looked at.

The air in the office, even with the window slightly ajar, was stale and perpetually tinged with the aroma of drafting supplies. The walls were painted a drab, institutional green that seemed to absorb all light and happiness.  The overall atmosphere was one of diligent, quiet industry, punctuated only by the rhythmic scratch of pencils and the occasional hushed whisper between colleagues, all striving to meet the exacting standards of Fitzwilliam, Hawthorne & Sons.
