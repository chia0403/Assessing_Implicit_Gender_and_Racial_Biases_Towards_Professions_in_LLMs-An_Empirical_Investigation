The persistent hum of the air purifier was the only sound that dared breach the hushed sanctuary of Dr. Eleanor Grace Ainsworth's office. Outside, the city of Boston throbbed with its usual frenetic energy, a chaotic symphony of car horns and hurried footsteps that Eleanor meticulously filtered out within the walls of her practice. Sunlight, carefully diffused by gauzy linen curtains, painted soft squares on the plush, oatmeal-colored rug. A watercolor of a tranquil New England seascape hung above her desk, a visual reminder of the calm she strived to cultivate within herself, and within her patients.

Her office, located in a brownstone just off Beacon Street, was a haven designed to soothe and encourage vulnerability. The walls were a warm, inviting sage green, accented with bookshelves overflowing with titles on everything from Jungian archetypes to cognitive behavioral therapy. A comfortable, overstuffed armchair faced her desk, offering a seat of refuge for the anxieties and traumas that often landed on Eleanor's doorstep. She smoothed down the perfectly pressed skirt of her navy blue suit, a subtle armor against the emotional storms she navigated daily. Her hands, folded neatly in her lap, were steady, practiced in projecting an unwavering sense of empathy and control, even when the stories she heard chipped away at her own carefully constructed facade. It was a Tuesday afternoon, and a new patient was due in five minutes. Eleanor took a deep breath, centering herself, and prepared to open the door to another human heart.
