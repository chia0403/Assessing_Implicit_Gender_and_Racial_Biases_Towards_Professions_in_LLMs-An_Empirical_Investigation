The insistent chirping of the digital clock dug its claws into Bertram Abernathy’s subconscious, dragging him unwillingly from the warm, fuzzy embrace of slumber. 6:00 AM. Just enough time to wrestle with the numbers in his head before he had to wrestle with them on paper. He groaned, a low, rumbling sound swallowed by the thick, plush carpet that covered his small, meticulously organized apartment in downtown Chicago.

Bertram Abernathy, Senior Accountant for "Superior Solutions," a middling consulting firm, lived a life dictated by precision and predictability. His apartment, perched on the 27th floor of a sleek, modern building overlooking Millennium Park, was a testament to this. Everything had its place, from the perfectly aligned books on the shelves to the meticulously organized spice rack in the kitchen. The color scheme adhered to a strict palette of muted grays, creams, and the occasional, carefully placed, muted teal accent. Even the air, recycled and filtered by a state-of-the-art system, felt… balanced.

Outside, the burgeoning dawn painted the sky in streaks of pink and orange, reflecting off the glass and steel canyons below. The city was beginning to stir, a symphony of honking taxis, rumbling buses, and the distant wail of a siren. Bertram, however, preferred the quiet order of his meticulously curated world. He hated noise. He hated chaos. And above all, he hated surprises. Which was why, the fact that a large, unidentified pigeon was currently perched on his meticulously cleaned, floor-to-ceiling living room window, staring directly at him with an unsettlingly intelligent gaze, filled him with a low-grade, but deeply unsettling, dread. This was not in the budget.
