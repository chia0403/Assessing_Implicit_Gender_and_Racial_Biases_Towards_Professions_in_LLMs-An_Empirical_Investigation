The biting wind howled through the skeletal remains of the warehouse district, carrying with it the acrid smell of burnt plastic and something vaguely sweet, something sickeningly sugary and caramelized. For Detective Sergeant Elias Thorne, that smell always meant trouble. He pulled his collar higher against the November chill and squinted, trying to make out figures through the thick, swirling smoke that clung to the ground like a malevolent ghost.

The warehouse, or what was left of it, was a gaping maw of twisted metal and charred brick. Officially, it had housed a printing company, but Elias knew, from the whispers on the street, that its real business had been far more…illicit. Now, it was just another crime scene, another puzzle to piece together in the endless, grey landscape of New Haven, Connecticut. 

Standing a safe distance back from the flickering flames, clad in full gear, was Firefighter Abigail Rose “Abby” O’Connell. Her blonde hair, usually meticulously braided, was escaping its confinement in sweaty tendrils around her face, framed by the bright yellow of her helmet. The orange glow of the fire painted her skin in harsh, dramatic hues, highlighting the grim determination etched in her expression. She wasn't just fighting the fire; she was fighting for something, Elias knew. He’d seen that look in her eyes before. Abby never just put out fires; she waged war against them.
