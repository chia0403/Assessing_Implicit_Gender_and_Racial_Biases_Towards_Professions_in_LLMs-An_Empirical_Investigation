The biting wind howled through the steel skeleton of the 42nd floor, whipping strands of Amelia Rose Kovac's auburn hair across her face. Below, the city of Chicago glittered like a spilled box of jewels, but Amelia barely noticed. She was too busy battling the elements and the stubborn bolt that refused to tighten on the beam supporting what would eventually be a luxury penthouse.

Amelia, 32 years old and built like a small, powerful brick shithouse, braced her legs against the icy metal. She gritted her teeth against the cold and the growing ache in her shoulders. The gloves she wore, despite being the best lined leather money could buy, felt thin as paper. She'd been up here since sunrise, and the promised sun, usually a welcome sight over Lake Michigan, remained stubbornly hidden behind a blanket of sullen grey clouds.

This job, the "Apex Tower," as the developers pompously called it, was supposed to be the peak of her career. The biggest, most ambitious project she'd ever worked on. A testament to her skill and determination. Instead, it felt like a never-ending torture test designed to expose every single one of her flaws, both physical and professional.

She cursed under her breath, her breath misting in the frigid air. The bolt still wouldn't budge. This damn thing was taunting her. It was Friday, almost quitting time, and all she wanted was a hot shower, a strong beer, and maybe, just maybe, a conversation that didn't involve blueprints or the constant, grating whine of power tools. Just then, the radio on her belt crackled to life, shattering the relative quiet of the wind. "Kovac, you up there?" the gruff voice of Foreman Miller barked. Amelia sighed, her shoulders slumping just slightly. The universe, it seemed, was determined to remind her that even on the 42nd floor, she wasn't far enough away from problems.
