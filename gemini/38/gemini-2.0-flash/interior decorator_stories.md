The persistent drip from the leaky faucet echoed in the otherwise silent apartment, a maddening counterpoint to the chirping crickets outside. Rain, a common occurrence in Seattle, lashed against the panoramic windows, blurring the already hazy skyline. Eleanor Isabelle Vance sighed, setting down her charcoal pencil. Another sketch, another dead end. Sheâ€™d been staring at the same awkwardly placed support beam for the better part of three hours, trying to figure out how to transform this bland, modern box into something resembling a home.

The apartment, a sprawling penthouse overlooking Puget Sound, belonged to billionaire tech mogul, Reginald Harding. He had the money to buy anything, but seemingly no taste. Cold, minimalist, and echoing with emptiness, it was a testament to function over feeling, and Eleanor felt a familiar wave of frustration wash over her. Reginald Harding had given her carte blanche and an unlimited budget, the kind of commission most interior decorators would kill for. But he'd also given her *himself* - his demanding nature, his constant second-guessing, and his complete lack of vision.

Eleanor Isabelle Vance prided herself on understanding her clients, on finding the essence of their personality and reflecting it within the spaces they inhabited. But Reginald Harding was a cipher, a man built on algorithms and quarterly profits. Finding the heart of this project felt akin to finding a seashell buried in the concrete of the Space Needle.
