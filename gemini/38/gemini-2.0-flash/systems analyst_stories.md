The flickering fluorescent lights of the server room hummed a monotonous lullaby, a lullaby that usually soothed Amelia Beatrice Stone. Tonight, however, the mechanical drone grated on her nerves, each pulse of light mirroring the frantic hammering in her chest. Outside, the Chicago wind howled a mournful tune, threatening to shatter the already frost-covered windows of the Continental Insurance headquarters.

Amelia, a systems analyst by trade and a puzzle solver at heart, was hunched over a server rack, her fingers flying across the keyboard of her ruggedized laptop. Sweat slicked her brow, plastering stray strands of her auburn hair to her forehead. The room smelled of ozone and stale coffee, a potent cocktail that usually fueled her late-night problem-solving sessions. Tonight, it just tasted like panic.

The digital clock on the server rack mocked her with its unwavering red glow: 3:17 AM. In a little over two hours, Continental would open its digital doors for business, and if Amelia didn’t fix this catastrophic system failure, chaos would reign. The company’s entire claims processing system, the very lifeblood of Continental Insurance, was down. And so far, Amelia was coming up empty.
