Okay, here's a story opening and setting centered around a stone cutter named Elias Thorne:

**Setting:**

The setting is the village of Oakhaven, nestled in the foothills of the Whisperwind Mountains. Oakhaven is a place steeped in tradition, where the rhythm of life is dictated by the changing seasons and the ancient stones that form the very foundation of their homes. The village is known for its skilled artisans, particularly its stone cutters, who quarry the distinctive grey granite of the Whisperwind Mountains. The air is often crisp and carries the scent of pine and the earthy tang of freshly cut stone. The architecture is simple and sturdy, built to withstand the harsh winters, with many buildings adorned with intricate carvings that tell stories of the village's history and folklore. Elias's workshop is a ramshackle affair at the edge of the village, perpetually dusted with granite grit, filled with the clang of his tools, and boasting a half-finished sculpture of a mythical griffin, its wings perpetually caught in mid-flight.

**Story Opening:**

The predawn sky was the color of bruised plums when Elias Thorne, a man built like the very mountains he sculpted, began his day. His breath plumed in the frigid air as he unlocked the heavy oak door of his workshop, the hinges groaning a familiar lament. He was a silhouette against the faint glow of the hearth within, his broad shoulders hunched slightly under the weight of years spent coaxing beauty from unyielding stone. Elias paused, his hand resting on the cool, rough surface of a half-finished gargoyle. Its leering face seemed to mock the approaching dawn. He ran a calloused thumb across a chipped fang, a habit he'd developed over the years, a silent conversation with the stone. Today was market day in Oakhaven, and he needed to finish at least one small piece to sell â€“ preferably something that would fetch more than a loaf of bread and a handful of dried beans. The winter had been harsh, and the village coffers, and his own, were running dangerously low.
