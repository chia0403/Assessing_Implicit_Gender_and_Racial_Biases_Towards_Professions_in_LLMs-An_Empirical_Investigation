The flickering neon sign of "The Golden Spoon Diner" cast a sickly yellow glow across Evelyn Rose Hawthorne's face as she huddled deeper into her worn leather jacket. It was 3:17 AM in Harmony Creek, Iowa, a town so quiet you could hear a squirrel whisper sweet nothings to its acorn stash. And Evelyn, Harmony Creek's most tenacious, albeit least successful, real estate agent, was staring across the deserted Main Street at 14 Willow Lane, a property that was quickly becoming the bane of her existence.

Harmony Creek, nestled amidst rolling cornfields and boasting a population that peaked around 800 in the summer, wasn't exactly a hotbed for real estate transactions. Most folks inherited their homes, built them themselves, or, like the previous owner of 14 Willow Lane, died in them. And that was the problem.

Old Mrs. Gable, bless her soul, had peacefully expired in her rocking chair by the fireplace three months ago. The house had been on the market ever since. Not because of the price, which Evelyn had painstakingly lowered to an almost insulting amount, but because of the persistent, unsettling rumour that Mrs. Gable hadn't actually left. At least, not entirely. And Evelyn Rose Hawthorne, champion of the underdog property, was starting to wonder if the rumour was true. The flickering streetlight only added to the sense of unease, painting long, dancing shadows across the dilapidated Victorian's porch. Tonight, she was determined to get to the bottom of it, armed with a thermos of lukewarm coffee and a healthy dose of skepticism. Or, at least, as much skepticism as a woman who relied on selling haunted houses in Harmony Creek could muster.
