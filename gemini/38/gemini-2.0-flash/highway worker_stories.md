The sun beat down on Arthur Bartholomew “Bart” Miller's neck, a familiar, unforgiving kiss. Heat shimmered off the asphalt, blurring the already monotonous landscape of endless highway. Bart squinted, pushing the brim of his faded orange hard hat lower. Another mile, another crack sealed. He could practically feel the tar bubbling inside the kettle, a low, greasy rumble mirroring the weariness in his own bones.

The setting was US Highway 93, about twenty miles south of Kingman, Arizona. It was desolate country: a ribbon of black snaking through a tapestry of sun-baked browns and ochres. Joshua trees, gnarled and skeletal, punctuated the sparse vegetation. The silence, punctuated only by the rhythmic roar of passing eighteen-wheelers and the clank of Bart's tools, was a palpable thing. The air, thick and dry, smelled of dust and hot asphalt. This particular stretch of 93 was notoriously isolated, a forgotten corner of the state where the rattlesnakes were bolder, the shadows longer, and cell service was a flickering, unreliable myth. Bart liked it that way. He just wished the heat wasn't trying to melt him into the tarmac.
