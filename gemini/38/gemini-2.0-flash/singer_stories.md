The spotlight hit just as Elara Violet Thorne reached the crescendo of "Lost at Sea," bathing her in a luminous, almost ethereal glow. A collective sigh rippled through the dimly lit, smoky confines of The Velvet Curtain, a jazz club nestled in the heart of New Orleans' French Quarter. The air, thick with the scent of stale cigarettes, cheap bourbon, and the ghosts of a thousand lost souls, vibrated with the raw emotion Elara poured into every note.

The Velvet Curtain was a place where dreams went to either be realized or to slowly, agonizingly, drown. It was a haven for the broken, the hopeful, and the deeply, irrevocably in love with the city's melancholic charm. Tarnished velvet booths lined the walls, their plushness offering a momentary respite from the harsh realities just outside. Above, ornate chandeliers, their crystals dull with grime, cast flickering shadows that danced like secrets on the faces in the audience. The stage, no bigger than a postage stamp, had hosted legends, from Billie Holiday to Ella Fitzgerald's lesser-known cousin, Esmeralda. It was a proving ground, a baptism by fire, and tonight, Elara was laying her soul bare on its worn planks.
