The aroma of garlic, rosemary, and simmering stock clung to Antoine Dubois like a second skin. He’d worn the scent for so long, he barely noticed it anymore, but the early morning market vendors certainly did. Antoine Dubois, head chef of "Le Chat Noir," a tiny, perpetually-booked bistro nestled in the labyrinthine backstreets of Vieux Lyon, was a fixture. He'd been sourcing the freshest ingredients from these very stalls for the past twenty years, his booming laugh and sharp wit as much a part of the morning ritual as the dew on the lettuce.

The setting was the sun-drenched marketplace of Vieux Lyon, France. Ancient cobblestones, worn smooth by centuries of footsteps, stretched between overflowing stalls piled high with colorful produce, fragrant herbs, and plump, glistening cuts of meat. The air hummed with the low thrum of morning chatter – vendors hawking their wares, housewives haggling over prices, and Antoine, weaving his way through the throng with the practiced ease of a conductor leading his orchestra. The rising sun cast long shadows, painting the medieval architecture in hues of gold and rose, promising another beautiful day in the heart of France. Even before the bells of the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Cathedral chimed seven, the marketplace throbbed with life, a symphony of sights, sounds, and smells that Antoine Dubois considered the most inspiring start to any day.
