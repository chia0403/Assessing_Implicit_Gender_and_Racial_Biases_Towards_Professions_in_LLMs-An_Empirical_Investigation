## The Story Opening

The insistent rasp of the emergency call startled Dr. Alistair Humphrey Beaumont awake. Not that he'd been truly asleep, mind you. He'd been hovering in that purgatorial space between wakefulness and slumber, haunted by the image of fractured ribs and the hollow rasp of a dying man's breath. He glanced at the bedside clock: 3:17 AM. The call was coming from his landline, a relic he stubbornly refused to relinquish despite the ubiquity of mobile phones in the remote Scottish Highlands.

He fumbled for the receiver, the cold plastic a jarring contrast to the lingering warmth of his down duvet. "Beaumont," he croaked, his voice thick with sleep.

A frantic, high-pitched voice assaulted his ear. "Doctor! Doctor Beaumont! You have to come, it's terrible, it's... Mrs. MacMillan, she's..." The voice trailed off into a choked sob.

Alistair's mind instantly snapped into focus, the remnants of his nightmare banished. Mrs. MacMillan. Agnes. A sweet, silver-haired woman with a penchant for strong tea and even stronger opinions on the weather. He knew something like this was coming; her chest was riddled with cancer. But knowing and being ready were two entirely different things.

"Where are you calling from, Mrs. Campbell?" he asked, his voice calm and reassuring, a practiced mask he'd honed over years of dealing with panicked patients.

"Croft Number Four, just past the loch," she gasped. "Please, Doctor, hurry!"

## The Setting

The setting is the **Scottish Highlands**, specifically a small, isolated village nestled amongst rolling hills and overlooking a vast, brooding loch.

**The village:** Known as Lochleven, it's a place where time seems to move slower, where the modern world encroaches reluctantly. Most of the buildings are constructed from the local gray stone, weathered by centuries of wind and rain. Croft houses, scattered across the surrounding hillsides, are the lifeblood of the community, their small plots of land providing a meager but honest living. The village pub, "The Stag's Head," is the center of social life, where locals gather to share stories, drink whisky, and escape the harsh realities of Highland life.

**Dr. Beaumont's Home:** Alistair lives in a converted stone farmhouse on the edge of the village, a property that had belonged to his family for generations. Inside, the decor is a blend of old and new, with antique furniture passed down through his family alongside modern medical equipment and a well-stocked library. The house offers a stunning view of the loch, a constant reminder of both the beauty and the isolation of his chosen life.

**The Time:** The present day, but a present that feels steeped in the past. There's a lingering sense of history, tradition, and a deep connection to the land that shapes the lives of everyone who lives here.
