The sun beat down on Jedediah Walker’s weathered face, etching the lines around his eyes deeper with each passing year. The dust, the endless, fine-grained dust of the Red River Valley, coated everything: his worn leather chaps, the sweat-soaked bandanna tied around his throat, even the sparse vegetation clinging to the arid landscape. Jedediah spat a stream of tobacco juice into the cracked earth, the sound swallowed by the relentless wind that whistled through the canyons. He squinted at the horizon, the shimmering heat waves distorting the already desolate vista.

His ranch, the "Last Chance," was anything but. Named with a hopeful, almost desperate, irony by his grandfather, it was a sprawling, unforgiving expanse of rock and scrub, carved out of the wild heart of West Texas. Fences, built with sweat and ingenuity, stretched as far as the eye could see, marking the boundaries of Jedediah’s livelihood, his inheritance, and his burden. Today, that burden felt particularly heavy, the silence broken only by the mournful lowing of cattle echoing from the distant water trough, a sound that usually brought Jedediah a sense of connection, but now only amplified the isolation and the creeping fear that clung to him like the dust.
