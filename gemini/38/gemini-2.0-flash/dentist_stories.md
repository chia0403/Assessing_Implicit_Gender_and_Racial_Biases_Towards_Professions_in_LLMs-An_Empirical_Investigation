## The Story:

**Opening:**

The dull, rhythmic hum of the ultrasonic scaler was the soundtrack to Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Vance's Tuesday afternoon. Usually, it was a comforting white noise, a sign that she was doing her job, banishing plaque and decay from the mouths of Maple Creek. Today, however, the sound grated on her nerves, a tiny, insistent mosquito buzzing in her ear. Mr. Henderson, a retired accountant with a fondness for Werther's Originals and an even stronger aversion to flossing, was reclined in her chair, his mouth agape, a pink and cavernous landscape illuminated by the harsh overhead lamp. Ellie gripped the scaler a little tighter, the cool metal a small comfort in her suddenly clammy hand. It wasn’t the work, not really. It was the gnawing unease that had settled in her gut like a bad filling, a feeling that something was deeply, profoundly wrong in Maple Creek, and she couldn't shake the suspicion that it had something to do with the suspiciously cheerful newcomer who'd arrived last week.

**Setting:**

Ellie Vance’s dental practice, "Vance Family Dentistry," was a converted Victorian house on Elm Street, the heart of the small, picturesque town of Maple Creek, Vermont. The waiting room boasted floral wallpaper, well-worn copies of National Geographic, and a fish tank filled with lethargic goldfish named Molar and Plaque (a joke Ellie's father, the practice's founder, had found endlessly amusing). The treatment rooms were modern and spotless, filled with state-of-the-art equipment, a sharp contrast to the house's antique charm. From the windows of Room Two, Ellie had a view of the town square, complete with its quaint gazebo and the towering maple tree that gave the town its name. The air in Maple Creek, even in the heat of summer, always had a faint crispness to it, a hint of mountain air and the promise of changing leaves. While idyllic on the surface, Maple Creek held a quiet, almost unsettling tranquility, the kind that made Ellie feel like she was living inside a snow globe, beautiful and still, but fragile and easily shattered.
