Okay, here's a story opening and setting, including the full name of the main character, who is a guard:

**Opening:**

The biting wind howled through the crenellations, tugging at Sergeant Elias Thorneâ€™s heavy wool cloak. He shivered, though whether from the cold or the creeping dread that had taken root in his gut, he couldn't say. For seventeen years, Elias had stood guard on the western wall of Oakhaven, a stoic sentinel against the wilderness. Seventeen years of mostly uneventful nights, filled only with the mournful cries of wolves and the occasional panicked scamper of a rabbit. But tonight, the air was thick with a silence that felt more oppressive than any storm. Even the stars, usually a comforting blanket of light above the valley, seemed to be hiding behind a veil of unseen fear. He gripped the worn leather of his spear, his knuckles white, and prayed to the Old Gods that whatever was coming stayed on the other side of the Whispering Woods.
**Setting:**

The story takes place in Oakhaven, a walled city nestled in a valley at the edge of the Whispering Woods. Oakhaven is a relatively small, self-sufficient community with a population of around 2,000 people. The city is primarily built of stone, with a central keep towering above the surrounding buildings. The economy is based on farming, crafts, and some limited trade with neighboring villages.

The Whispering Woods, bordering Oakhaven, is a vast and ancient forest, known for its unnerving silence and unsettling phenomena. Local legends speak of strange creatures and forgotten magic lurking within its depths. The woods are a constant source of fear and mystery for the people of Oakhaven.
