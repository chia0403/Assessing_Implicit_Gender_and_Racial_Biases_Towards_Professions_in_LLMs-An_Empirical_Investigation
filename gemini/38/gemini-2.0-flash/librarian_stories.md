## Story Opening and Setting:

**Story Opening:**

Beatrice Eleanor Ainsworth hated Thursdays. Not because of anything particularly calamitous that had ever befallen her on a Thursday, but because Thursday, in its dull, inoffensive mediocrity, highlighted the growing feeling that her life, too, was slowly turning into a beige, uninspired Thursday. The muted hum of the fluorescent lights in the Ainsworth Library seemed to mock her. Even the comforting scent of aged paper and leather, usually a balm to her soul, felt like a suffocating blanket of predictability. Today, even the predictable was fraying. Mrs. Higgins, usually a beacon of docile patronage, had just loudly accused a biography of Teddy Roosevelt of being “scandalously biased” for the third time this morning. Beatrice sighed, adjusting her spectacles and preparing to unleash her most soothing, "library voice."

**Setting:**

The Ainsworth Library is a brick-and-mortar testament to a bygone era in the small, historically-minded town of Havenwood, Massachusetts. Built in 1927, the library retains its original Art Deco facade, complete with intricate carvings of mythical creatures interspersed amongst stylized books. Inside, the space is surprisingly bright, thanks to the large arched windows that line the walls. Sunlight streams in, illuminating the polished oak shelves that stretch towards the high, coffered ceiling. The air is thick with the scent of aged paper, beeswax polish, and a faint hint of lavender, a scent Beatrice herself introduced to subtly combat the stuffiness. The main reading room houses a grand fireplace, rarely used but nonetheless a focal point, and comfortable wingback chairs are scattered throughout, inviting patrons to linger and lose themselves in the stacks. At the far end of the room, a small, cluttered desk serves as Beatrice's domain. It is piled high with returned books, overdue notices, and her ever-present mug of Earl Grey tea, a testament to her dedication to order, even amidst chaos. Despite the town's growing embrace of digital information, the Ainsworth Library stubbornly remains a beloved and well-utilized community hub, largely due to Beatrice's unwavering passion and dedication.
