The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual latte brown, reflected the flickering gaslight above Amelia Nightingale's head.  Dust motes danced in the pale glow, mirroring the hesitant tremor in her hands as she clutched the worn leather-bound notebook.  Outside, the cobbled streets of Southwark, London, 1888, echoed with the drunken cries of costermongers and the mournful wail of a nearby organ grinder.  Amelia, a young woman with eyes the colour of stormy seas and hair the shade of raven's wings, hummed a melody, a haunting counterpoint to the city's symphony of late-night sounds.  She was a singer, a ballad-monger with a voice that could soothe a storm and a repertoire as vast as the sprawling metropolis surrounding her.  Tonight, however, the melody was lost in the fear clenching her heart.  Tonight, the music felt...wrong.
