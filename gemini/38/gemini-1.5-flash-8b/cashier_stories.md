The fluorescent lights of the "Corner Mart" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's life.  The air, thick with the smell of stale coffee and the faint, cloying sweetness of expired candy, clung to her like a second skin.  It was a Tuesday, the kind of Tuesday where the only excitement was the slow drip, drip, drip of the automatic coffee machine, and the rhythmic clinking of coins in the register drawer. Amy, perched behind the glass counter, felt the familiar weight of the day settle on her shoulders, heavy as a sack of potatoes.

The Corner Mart, nestled between a dilapidated laundromat and a perpetually-empty storefront, was a microcosm of quiet desperation.  Its faded paint job and chipped tile floor mirrored the worn-out souls of the regulars who frequented it.  The only vibrant color was the faded sign, barely holding onto the fluorescent pink that had once screamed "FRESH!"  But, like the wilting flowers in the tiny display window, even the "Fresh Produce" section seemed to give up without a fight.
