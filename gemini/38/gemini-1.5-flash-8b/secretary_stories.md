Rain hammered against the arched windows of the Blackwood Manor library, a relentless tattoo that mirrored the frantic rhythm of Amelia Blackwood's heart.  The air, thick with the scent of old parchment and damp earth, hung heavy around her, a tangible weight pressing down on the already considerable anxieties swirling within.

Books, stacked high to the vaulted ceiling, cast long, dancing shadows that danced with the flickering candlelight. Dust motes, disturbed by the unseen drafts, swirled in the air, mimicking the chaos in her mind.  Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, and the rhythmic drumming of the rain was a constant, unsettling counterpoint to the frantic drumming in her chest. The mahogany desk, polished to a lustrous sheen, sat before her, a silent, unyielding testament to the weight of the impending crisis.  Her position, usually a haven of controlled efficiency, felt now like a pressure cooker on the verge of exploding.
