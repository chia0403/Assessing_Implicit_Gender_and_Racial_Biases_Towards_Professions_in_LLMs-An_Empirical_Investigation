The biting wind whipped Amelia Hayesâ€™s crimson fire-resistant jacket around her, stinging her cheeks and making her breath cloud in icy puffs.  Below, the flickering orange glow of the inferno cast long, dancing shadows across the snow-dusted streets of the mountain town of Havenwood.  The air, thick with the acrid smell of burning wood and something indefinably metallic, hung heavy and oppressive.  This wasn't just a house fire; this was a war.

Havenwood, nestled deep within the jagged peaks of the Cascade Mountains, was a place of breathtaking beauty and equally terrifying isolation.  In winter, the world shrank around the town, blanketed in a thick, silent shroud of snow that trapped the cold and, in recent years, a growing sense of unease.  The weathered, timber-framed houses, clinging to the slopes like stubborn ivy, seemed to whisper stories of generations past, stories that now echoed with the crackling of flames and the anguished cries of the trapped.  Amelia, her boots crunching on the frozen ground, felt the weight of those stories on her shoulders, a heavy burden in a place already strained by the harsh elements. Her name, though, carried a history of its own, a quiet legacy whispered through the generations of Havenwood's protectors.
