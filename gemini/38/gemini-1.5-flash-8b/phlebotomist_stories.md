The fluorescent hum of the clinic's waiting room, a low, persistent thrumming that echoed the rhythmic beat of Amelia "Em"  Everhart's own heart, was the soundtrack to her life.  Em, a phlebotomist with hands that moved with practiced grace over veins, felt a familiar knot tighten in her chest.  Another Monday, another mountain of anxious patients.  This one, a woman with eyes the colour of faded amethyst and a cardigan that smelled faintly of pine needles, was already displaying the telltale signs of stress â€“ a rhythmic tap-tap-tap of her manicured fingernails against the worn vinyl.

The clinic, a small, unassuming building nestled between a bakery overflowing with the sweet scent of cinnamon rolls and a bustling hardware store, radiated a quiet efficiency.  Sunlight, filtered through the grimy panes of the windows, dappled the floor in shifting patterns of light and shadow.  A single potted fern, stubbornly clinging to life in a corner, seemed to mock the sterile, almost clinical atmosphere.  The scent of antiseptic, always present, mingled with the faint aroma of freshly brewed coffee, a scent that had a curious way of evoking both comfort and unease. Each of the small, individual cubicles whispered of the stories untold, the anxieties contained, the quiet desperation that Em, in her own way, understood so well.
