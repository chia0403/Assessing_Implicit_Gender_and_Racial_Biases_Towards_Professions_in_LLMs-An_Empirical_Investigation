Professor Eleanor Vance-Armstrong, a woman whose tweed jacket perpetually smelled faintly of old paper and pipe tobacco, stared out the grimy window of her office at the rain-slicked cobblestones of Oxford.  The chipped porcelain teacup trembled slightly in her hand, mirroring the tremor in her voice as she muttered to herself.  The year was 1937.  The scent of damp earth and burning coal hung heavy in the air, a familiar, if sometimes suffocating, perfume of the English autumn.  Her office, tucked away on the third floor of the Ashmolean Museum, was crammed with overflowing bookshelves, dusty artifacts, and the half-finished sketches for a manuscript she'd been working on for what felt like an eternity.  A chipped teacup sat on a cluttered desk, a lone testament to a recent, and perhaps ill-fated, attempt at a much-needed break.  The relentless rhythm of the rain against the windowpane seemed to echo the relentless drumbeat of her own anxieties.  This was a particular brand of Oxford autumn, thick with the weight of secrets and the potential for revolution.
