The biting wind whipped Amelia Kensington's camera bag tighter around her shoulders, the nylon groaning in protest against the relentless Alaskan blizzard.  Frozen breath frosted the lens of her Leica, a shimmering, almost otherworldly, white against the stark, monochrome landscape.  The air hung thick with the scent of pine needles and something else, something metallic and faintly acrid, that clung to the fur of the arctic foxes sheâ€™d seen earlier, ghostly figures flitting across the snow-covered tundra.  She was halfway up the treacherous slope of Mount Denali, the massive peak looming like a jagged tooth, obscured and yet strangely visible in the swirling snow.  Amelia, a freelance wildlife photographer for National Geographic, was on assignment to capture the elusive, and increasingly rare, Denali snowshoe hare.  Three weeks into her expedition, the relentless weather had tested her resolve, her equipment, and her sanity.  This was a photo-shoot she wasn't sure she'd survive.


The setting:  The remote, windswept slopes and glaciers of Mount Denali National Park in Alaska, winter.  The landscape is brutal, beautiful, and unforgiving.  The air is frigid, the visibility often near zero.
