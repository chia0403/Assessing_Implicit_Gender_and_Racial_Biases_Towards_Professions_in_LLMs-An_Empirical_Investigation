Sunlight, filtered through a canopy of vibrant, tropical foliage, painted the scene in dappled light.

Amidst the fragrant chaos, Dr. Isabella "Izzy" Ramirez, a registered dietitian and nutritionist with a passion for sustainable food systems, navigated the throng.  Her tailored linen shirt, a vibrant cerulean, was practically swallowed by the vivid colours around her – saffron-yellow spices, ruby-red mangoes, and emerald-green limes.  Izzy’s eyes, a warm hazel, scanned the array of produce, her mind already cataloguing the potential nutritional benefits and hidden dangers lurking within the kaleidoscope of exotic fruits and vegetables.
