The year was 1888.  The scent of damp earth and brewing discontent hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint aroma of woodsmoke from the nearby cottages.  Barty Finch, a man whose face bore the etched lines of countless trials and sleepless nights, adjusted his spectacles, his gaze sweeping over the assembled figures â€“ the defendant, a gaunt woman with eyes that held the weight of a thousand sorrows, and the prosecutor, a burly man whose jowls seemed to tremble with the ferocity of his accusations.  This case, whispered about for weeks in the hushed corners of the town, threatened to shatter the fragile peace of Oakhaven.  The accusations against Elara Blackwood, of witchcraft and heresy, were as old as the town itself, yet the air crackled with a fear and distrust that felt entirely new.
