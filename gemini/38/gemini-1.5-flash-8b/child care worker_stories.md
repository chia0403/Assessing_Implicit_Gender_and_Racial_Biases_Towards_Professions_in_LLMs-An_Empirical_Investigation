The fluorescent lights of the "Rainbow Adventures" daycare hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia Rose Hawthorne's day.  Crumbs of Cheerios clung to the edges of the brightly-colored play mats, a testament to the relentless energy of the four-year-olds she supervised.  Today, however, the usual cacophony of giggles and shrieks was muted, replaced by an unnerving stillness.  Amelia, a young woman with eyes that held a surprising depth for her 23 years, felt a prickle of unease.  The air, usually thick with the scent of playdough and baby powder, held a faint, metallic tang, almost imperceptible, but unsettling nonetheless.  

The daycare, nestled in the quiet cul-de-sac of Maplewood, resembled a brightly colored, slightly chaotic ship, designed to nurture young imaginations.  Bold primary colors painted every wall, and whimsical murals depicting fantastical creatures adorned the hallways.  Wooden blocks and soft toys filled the various rooms, each designated for a different activity â€“ dramatic play, art, learning, and rest. The aroma of freshly-made applesauce and crayons always seemed to hang in the air, but today, it seemed subtly off, like a faint metallic undertone.  Sunlight streamed through the large windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the stillness, casting a faint golden glow over the hushed room.
