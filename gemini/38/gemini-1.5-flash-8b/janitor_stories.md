The fluorescent lights of the "Apex Research Institute" hummed, a monotonous drone that perpetually thrummed beneath Amelia Petrova’s worn cleaning gloves.  Dust motes danced in the pale, sterile light, mirroring the almost-invisible particles of worry swirling in her stomach.  The Institute, a gleaming edifice of polished granite and shimmering glass, housed some of the world’s most advanced, and arguably, most secretive, scientific endeavors.  Amelia, however, was just the janitor, a silent observer in this meticulously crafted world of precision and possibility.  Today, though, the usual symphony of whirring machines and hushed conversations was strangely absent.  An unsettling quiet, thick with an unspoken tension, hung in the air, a stark contrast to the usual vibrant energy.  The polished floor, usually a mirror reflecting the stark white walls, now felt strangely dull, almost concealing some unseen truth.  She knew from years of tiptoeing through the silent hallways that there was something different in the air. Something, Amelia suspected, far more profound and far more dangerous than a simple lack of activity.  The Institute's humming machinery seemed to hold its breath.
