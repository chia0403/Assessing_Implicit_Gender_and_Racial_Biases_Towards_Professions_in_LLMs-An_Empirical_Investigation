The biting November wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks, carrying with it the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves.  Elias Thorne, groundskeeper for Blackwood Manor, hunched deeper into his threadbare overcoat, his breath misting in the frigid air.  The manor, a gothic masterpiece perched atop a craggy hill overlooking the valley, loomed before him, its imposing silhouette stark against the bruised twilight sky.  Jagged shadows stretched across the meticulously manicured lawns, twisting and contorting into monstrous shapes in the fading light. Elias adjusted his worn leather gloves, the leather stiff from the damp.  He'd been tasked with final pruning, a ritual he performed every autumn, and the task felt strangely heavy this year.  Not just the weight of the shears against his calloused hands, but a different kind of weight, settling like a fog in the corners of his mind.


The sprawling grounds of Blackwood Manor were a paradox.  Crisp, perfect lawns met overgrown, almost untamed pockets of woodland.  Ivy, thick and emerald green in summer, now clung to the decaying stone walls like a macabre shroud.  Ancient stone pathways wound through the grounds, disappearing into the dense undergrowth.  Mysterious statues, weathered and worn, stood sentinel in the gloom, their once-proud expressions obscured by the encroaching twilight.  A sense of history, thick and palpable, clung to the very air, whispering tales of long-dead lords and ladies, of secrets buried beneath the earth, and of the strange occurrences that, whisper had it, had followed Blackwood Manor for centuries.
