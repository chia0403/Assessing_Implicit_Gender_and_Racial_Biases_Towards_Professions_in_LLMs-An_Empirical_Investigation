The humid air hung heavy in the salon, thick with the scent of jasmine and something vaguely metallic, likely from the new line of hair dyes.  Amelia "Maisie"  Montrose, her name whispered with affection and a touch of playful disdain by her regulars, adjusted the delicate lighting above her station.  Dust motes danced in the shaft of afternoon sunlight slanting through the arched window, illuminating the swirling golds and copper tones that shimmered on the chipped ceramic bowl containing her chosen palette for the day.  Maisie, a cosmetologist with a reputation for transforming women—sometimes quite literally—was meticulously blending the pigments, her practiced hand moving with the grace of a painter.  The salon, "Reflections," was nestled in the heart of the bustling, historic district of Old Willow Creek.  Cobblestone streets, lined with ivy-covered buildings and overflowing flowerpots, wound their way past the shop.  The rhythmic clinking of horse-drawn carriages and the distant cries of street vendors mingled with the quieter sounds of the salon—the snip-snip of shears, the soft murmur of conversation, the occasional sigh of a client finally surrendering to the transformative power of a fresh cut and colour.  Maisie, always attuned to the subtle nuances of her environment, felt a shiver of anticipation.  This was not just another day at Reflections; this was the day she was finally going to meet the elusive "Miss Periwinkle."
