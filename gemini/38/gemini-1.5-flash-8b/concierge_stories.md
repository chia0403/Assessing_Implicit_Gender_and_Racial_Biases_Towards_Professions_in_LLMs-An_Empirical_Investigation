The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual blush from decades of lukewarm coffee and spilled Earl Grey, reflected the perpetual twilight of the grand Victorian hotel.  Rain hammered against the leaded glass of the entrance hall, a relentless percussion that drowned out the muted whispers of the lobby.  Inside, Amelia Nightingale, concierge of the Grand Chancellor Hotel, adjusted her meticulously pressed uniform – a navy blazer over a crisp white blouse – and sighed, the faint scent of lavender sachet clinging to her.  The hotel, a monument to bygone elegance, felt increasingly fragile beneath the relentless onslaught of the storm.

**Setting:** The Grand Chancellor Hotel, a grand Victorian hotel in a rain-swept, somewhat decaying but still beautiful, seaside town. The atmosphere is one of muted opulence, with glimpses of faded glory.  The specific location is important to the plot, as the hotel is connected to various local families and secrets.  The hotel's location, facing the ocean, gives an impression of both grandeur and vulnerability.
