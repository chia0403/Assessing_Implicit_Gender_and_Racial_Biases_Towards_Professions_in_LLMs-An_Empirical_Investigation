The flickering neon sign of the "Reliable Reinsurance Agency" cast a sickly yellow glow on Amelia Kensington's rain-slicked trench coat.  The air, thick with the scent of damp asphalt and frying onions from the greasy spoon across the street, hung heavy in the late-night air.  It was a Tuesday, the kind of Tuesday that promised a slow crawl of paperwork and lukewarm coffee, yet here Amelia was, staring out at the deserted street, a half-empty mug in her hand.  The city, usually a vibrant symphony of honking taxis and chattering crowds, was now a hushed, melancholic canvas, painted in shades of gray and reflected in the puddles that mirrored the city’s endless anxieties.

Amelia, a meticulous insurance agent with a sharp mind and even sharper tongue, was known for her efficiency and her knack for finding the loopholes in seemingly airtight situations. But tonight, those skills seemed useless, even irrelevant.  A gnawing sense of unease, a feeling she couldn't quite name, settled over her.  It had begun subtly, a persistent itch in her subconscious, and it now clawed at her throat like a hungry bird.  She was supposed to be reviewing a routine claim, but the file felt strangely…off. It smelled of something unspoken, something shrouded in the darkness of the city she knew so well.
