The biting wind, a relentless, icy claw, clawed at Sergeant Alistair Finch's tunic.  He shivered, not from the cold alone, but from the creeping dread that clung to the air like frost.  The flickering torchlight cast long, dancing shadows across the cobbled courtyard of the Citadel of the Azure Spire, highlighting the skeletal remains of a withered rosebush – a stark, almost macabre, reminder of the seasons turning, and of something else, something… *lost*.  The Citadel, a towering fortress of grey stone, seemed to press in on him, its silent sentinel walls humming with an unseen, unsettling energy.  Above, the moon, a pale sliver in the inky sky, offered no solace, only a cold, indifferent gaze.


The year was 1472.  The kingdom of Aeridor, once famed for its flourishing gardens and vibrant cities, now lay fractured beneath a perpetual shroud of fear and suspicion.  The recent blight, a creeping pestilence that withered crops and twisted the very souls of the afflicted, had left a lingering darkness in its wake.  The Citadel, once a beacon of hope, was now a grim outpost, a fortified island in a sea of uncertainty.  Alistair, a veteran of countless skirmishes and uneasy truces, was entrusted with the security of Gatehouse Three, responsible for the flow of supplies and the prevention of unwanted incursions.  Tonight, however, the silence was more terrifying than any uproar.  The usual flurry of activity—the creak of wagons, the murmur of voices, the rhythmic clang of blacksmiths' hammers—had been replaced by an unnerving stillness, a vacuum in the air that felt pregnant with impending doom.
