The clatter of needles against fabric, a rhythmic symphony of precision, filled the small, cluttered workshop.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of sunlight piercing the grime-coated windowpanes of  Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's tailor shop, "The Well-Stitched Seam."  Barty, a man whose hands, gnarled and stained with years of indigo and wax, moved with an almost supernatural dexterity, meticulously measured a length of crimson silk.  The fabric, shimmering like captured moonlight, was destined for the Lady Eleanor Blackwood, a patron as demanding as she was wealthy, known throughout the city of Veridia for her exquisite taste and even more exquisite disdain for ill-fitting garments.  Veridia itself, nestled amongst rolling hills and ancient, moss-covered stone walls, held a palpable sense of history.  Its cobblestone streets, perpetually echoing with the hushed footsteps of merchants and the tinkling of shop bells, pulsed with a life that was both vibrant and contained.  The air itself hummed with the unspoken stories of countless generations, whispering tales of brave knights and forgotten queens.  Barty, however, was more interested in the next stitch, the next perfectly aligned button, the next challenge presented by the fickle demands of fashion.  Today, however, the whispers carried more than just history; they carried a growing unease.  The humming in the city was getting louder, louder than the usual murmur of trade.  A shiver snaked down Barty's spine. Something was stirring.
