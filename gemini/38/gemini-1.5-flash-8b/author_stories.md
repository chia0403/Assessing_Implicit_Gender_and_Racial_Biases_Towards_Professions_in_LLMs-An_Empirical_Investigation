The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Blackwood's hands, the faint scent of Earl Grey clinging to the air of the cramped Bloomsbury flat.  Sunlight, fractured and filtered through the grime-streaked windowpanes, painted the room in a mosaic of amber and grey.  Dust motes danced in the beams, tiny, defiant specks against the backdrop of Amelia's cluttered workspace.  Books, overflowing from shelves that seemed to groan under their weight, lined every available inch of the walls.  Papers, scrawled with indecipherable scribbles and vibrant coloured highlighter streaks, lay scattered across the worn oak table, alongside a half-eaten loaf of sourdough bread and a chipped teacup.  Amelia, a writer of renown (or perhaps, obscurity, depending on whose opinion you valued),  was, as usual, wrestling with the opening chapter of her latest novel. The manuscript, titled "The Obsidian Mirror," sat, a silent, brooding beast, on a stack of rejected poems and crumpled outlines.  Outside, the ceaseless murmur of London traffic – a symphony of honking horns and the rhythmic thump-thump of passing buses – served as both a soundtrack and a reminder of the pressures she faced.
