The fluorescent hum of the pharmacy, "Apothecary's Corner," was a constant, almost comforting drone.  Amelia Rose Hawthorne, her auburn hair pulled back in a tight bun, meticulously measured out a precise amount of powdered chamomile.

Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight filtering through the dusty, leaded window, illuminating rows of apothecary jars, each bearing a label etched with a forgotten language.  Amelia, a pharmacist with a lifetime's reverence for the delicate balance between nature and medicine, knew the stories held within those jars â€“ of herbs gathered at dawn, of remedies passed down through generations. This quiet routine, this meticulous attention to detail, was her anchor.  But today, a new kind of unrest stirred within the usually placid atmosphere.
