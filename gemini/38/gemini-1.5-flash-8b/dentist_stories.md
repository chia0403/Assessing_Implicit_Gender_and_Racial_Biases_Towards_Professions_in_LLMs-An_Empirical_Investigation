The fluorescent hum of Dr. Eleanor Vance’s office was a constant, almost soothing, soundtrack to her life.  Sunlight, fractured and distorted by the building’s many angles, cast fleeting shadows across the polished stainless steel of her dental equipment.  The air, thick with the antiseptic scent of chlorhexidine and the faint, metallic tang of fear, hung heavy in the small, meticulously organized waiting room.  A chipped porcelain doll, its painted smile askew, sat perched precariously on a stack of magazines, a silent observer of the anxious whispers and stifled coughs that rippled through the room.

Eleanor Vance, a dentist with a reputation as sharp as her instruments and a heart as complicated as the root canals she meticulously carved, felt the familiar knot tightening in her chest.  Another Tuesday. Another patient. Another story etched onto the walls of her mind, a story she was tasked with extracting, one cavity at a time.  This week, it was a young man, barely a boy, with eyes that held the weight of unspoken secrets.  Her nameplate on the door, a simple, elegant script, seemed to mock her sometimes, a reminder that even the most practiced of hands couldn’t entirely soothe the pain hidden beneath a polished facade.
