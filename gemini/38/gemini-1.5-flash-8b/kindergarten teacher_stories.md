The chipped paint of the "Welcome to Sunnyside Kindergarten" sign, a faded yellow now streaked with beige, seemed to mock the brilliant azure sky.  Rain lashed against the corrugated metal roof of the playground, a relentless drumming that echoed the frantic rhythm in Amelia Blackwood's chest.  It wasn't the sound of the storm, though, that rattled her; it was the frantic whispers circulating through the small, brightly coloured classroom.

Amelia, a kindergarten teacher with a name that somehow felt both reassuring and slightly theatrical, adjusted her oversized cardigan.  Her auburn hair, usually a halo of sunshine around her face, was now plastered to her forehead in damp, unruly strands.  The classroom, usually a vibrant explosion of art projects and colourful blocks, felt muted, almost suffocating in its quiet anticipation.  A single, half-eaten apple sat abandoned on the wooden table, untouched amidst a scattering of discarded crayons.  A faint scent of pine needles, carried on the wind, mingled with the musty aroma of old books and damp playdough.

The air hummed with unspoken fears and anxieties.  Around her, tiny, wide eyes darted, seeking reassurance from the familiar face of their teacher.  Amelia knew it couldn't be a normal day.
