The biting wind, a relentless prairie wolf, howled across the desolate expanse of the Wyoming Badlands. Dust devils danced across the cracked earth, mimicking the frantic beat of Elias Thorne's heart.  He squinted, the sun glinting off the jagged peaks of the Laramie Range, a stark contrast to the bruised purple hues of the bruised land around him.  His weathered hands, calloused from a lifetime spent wrestling with stubborn cattle and unforgiving terrain, tightened around the reins of his trusty sorrel mare,  Whisper.  The year was 1887, and a relentless drought, harsher than any Elias had known, had claimed countless lives - both animal and human.  The once vibrant green pastures were now scorched and barren, promising nothing but a desperate struggle for survival.  Elias, a rancher of the rugged Black Hills, felt a cold dread settle in his gut.  He wasn't just watching his herd dwindle; he was watching the very fabric of his life, his livelihood, unravel before him.  The whispers of the wind, usually a comforting lullaby on the plains, carried the chilling truth: this year, the land itself seemed to be fighting back.
