The scent of mildew and beeswax hung heavy in the air of Amelia Blackwood's tiny workshop, a space tucked between a cobbled alley and a towering brick wall.  Sunlight, fractured and weak, struggled to pierce the grime-coated windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air.  Amelia Blackwood, a dressmaker of considerable skill and even greater eccentricity, meticulously pinned a shimmering emerald silk swatch to a meticulously draped mannequin.  Her spectacles, perched precariously on her nose, magnified the tiny details of the fabric, highlighting the intricate pattern of woven gold thread.  The year was 1888.  London, a city humming with the energy of a thousand steam engines and whispered secrets, lay just beyond the cramped confines of Amelia's workshop.  A single, flickering gas lamp cast long shadows across the cluttered space, revealing rows of meticulously sorted fabrics, half-finished gowns, and the faintest trace of lavender perfume clinging to the air.
