The biting wind whipped Amelia "Maisie" Cartwright's tweed jacket around her, stinging her cheeks and frosting the breath in front of her.  The frosted breath, however, wasn't the only thing that clung to her.  The metallic tang of blood, sharp and acrid, clung to the air, mingling with the cloying scent of pine needles that clung to everything in the secluded Blackwood Forest.  This was Maisie’s domain, the isolated, snow-dusted veterinary clinic nestled at the edge of the forest, a precarious structure of weathered wood and glass, barely visible through the swirling snow.  A single, flickering gas lantern cast long, dancing shadows across the snow-covered path leading to the clinic.  Inside, the low hum of a heating stove struggled to counter the chill.  The silence was broken only by the rhythmic thump-thump of Maisie’s own heart, a frantic drumbeat echoing the growing unease in her stomach.  A frantic flurry of activity was underway.  A frantic call had pulled her back from the warmth of her cozy cabin, bringing her to this desolate outpost, into the heart of the Blackwood Forest, where whispers of strange animal behavior had been circulating. This time, it wasn't the usual stray cat or injured deer. This time, it was different.  Something sinister was afoot.
