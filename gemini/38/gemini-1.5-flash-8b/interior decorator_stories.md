The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the cluttered workshop of Amelia Hawthorne, Interior Decorator Extraordinaire.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single bulb dangling precariously from a fraying wire, swirled like miniature, spectral moths.  A riot of fabrics – emerald velvet, sun-bleached linen, sapphire brocade – draped over every available surface.  Paint swatches, pinned haphazardly to a weathered wooden plank, proclaimed a kaleidoscope of colors, from the muted grays of a forgotten era to the vibrant hues of modern abstraction.  Amelia, her name embroidered onto a faded apron, hunched over a meticulously crafted model of a sprawling country manor, meticulously tracing the lines of a proposed library with a charcoal pencil. The air, thick with the scent of linseed oil and pipe tobacco, hummed with the quiet energy of creation.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful dirge, a soundtrack to the city's restless slumber.
