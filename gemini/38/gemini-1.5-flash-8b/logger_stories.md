The biting wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the ancient redwoods, carrying with it the scent of pine needles and something akin to damp earth and fear.  Elias Thorne, a logger with hands like knotted oak and eyes the color of a stormy sea, shivered, not from the cold, but from a premonition that clung to him like the clinging moss on the forest floor.  He adjusted the worn leather strap of his axe, the familiar weight a comforting anchor in the encroaching unease.  The Redwood Creek valley, normally a symphony of the forest's breath—the rustling leaves, the distant hoot of an owl, the rhythmic drip of water—felt oppressive today. An unnatural silence hung heavy in the air, broken only by the creaking of the ancient trees themselves, as if groaning under a strain Elias couldn't quite comprehend.  The valley, once vibrant and alive, now felt hollow, as though a great sadness had settled over it, mirrored in the hollow, hollowed-out spaces in Elias's own chest.


He was positioned at the edge of a recently cleared section of forest, a stark, sun-drenched scar on the landscape.  A half-finished log cabin, its rough-hewn walls still lacking the final layer of shingles, stood like a skeletal hand reaching out into the forest.  A single, flickering fire cast long, dancing shadows across the exposed earth, illuminating the glinting metal of a discarded saw and the glint of something else—something metallic and unnatural—buried beneath a pile of recent cuttings.  This newly disturbed earth, once fertile and full of life, felt unnaturally hard, pressed down with a cold, alien weight.
