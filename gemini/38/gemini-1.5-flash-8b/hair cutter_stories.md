The chipped paint of the salon walls, a faded floral pattern that looked like a forgotten garden, was the only thing separating Elara Nightingale from the relentless rumble of the city outside.  Sunlight, fractured by the grime-coated windows, painted streaks of gold across the dust motes dancing in the air.  This was the sanctuary, or rather, the temporary haven, of Elara's Scissors & Souls salon.  Tucked away on a cobbled side street in the heart of Old Town, it was a place where the cacophony of the city seemed to lose its voice, replaced by the soft click of scissors against hair and the hushed murmur of whispered confidences.  Elara, a young woman with eyes the colour of stormy seas and hair the shade of midnight, hunched over her work, her sharp shears poised above a head of thick, tangled brown curls.  A symphony of buzzing clippers punctuated the silence, a rhythmic counterpoint to the steady rhythm of her shears, as she expertly sculpted the intricate design for her latest client.  It was a Tuesday, a day Elara usually reserved for quiet contemplation.  But today, the quiet was about to be shattered.
