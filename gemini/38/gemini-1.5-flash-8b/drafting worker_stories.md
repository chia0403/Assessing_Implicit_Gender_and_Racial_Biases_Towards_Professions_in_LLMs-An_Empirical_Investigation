The fluorescent lights of the "Precision Drafting & Design" factory hummed, a monotonous lullaby to the rhythmic click-clack of Elias Thorne's drafting pen across the smooth vellum.  Dust motes danced in the meagre shafts of light filtering through the grimy windows, illuminating the intricate, almost surreal, architectural renderings scattered across his drafting table.  Elias, a man of thirty-two with eyes that held the tired gleam of late nights and early mornings, traced a complex curve on a blueprint for a new high-rise.  He worked in the back corner of the sprawling factory, a space swallowed by the cacophony of the factory floor: the whir of machinery, the metallic scrape of metal on metal, the constant low growl of the air conditioning system.  Outside, the industrial city of Steelhaven sprawled, a concrete jungle shrouded in a perpetual grey haze.  The air itself tasted of coal smoke and the metallic tang of the nearby steelworks.  His job, his life, felt as inextricably linked to this place as the blueprints themselves were to the structures they depicted.
