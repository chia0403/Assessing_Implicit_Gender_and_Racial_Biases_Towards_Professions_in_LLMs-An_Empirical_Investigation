The biting wind whipped across the vast, desolate plains of the American Midwest, stinging Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez's cheeks as she wrestled the oversized tanker truck, the "Iron Horse," into a precarious parking spot at the dilapidated truck stop, "The Rusty Mug."  Dust devils danced across the cracked asphalt, mirroring the turmoil in Amy's gut.

She wasn't a woman who typically spent time ruminating on her decisions, but today, the silence in the vastness of the truck stop pressed in on her like a physical weight.  The delivery of the rare, experimental, and highly coveted 'Cosmic Bloom' serum - cargo classified as 'high-priority, utmost security' - was due, and the entire weight of the assignment, and the dangerous whispers surrounding it, rested squarely on her shoulders.  The 'Iron Horse' had been meticulously checked, the load locked tight, and every precaution taken, but a deep unease still throbbed within her.
