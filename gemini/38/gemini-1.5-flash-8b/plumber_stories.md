The flickering neon sign of "Ace Plumbing" cast a sickly yellow glow over the rain-slicked alley.  Water, a relentless, whispering curtain, hammered against the corrugated iron walls.  Inside, Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, a man whose perpetually damp overalls seemed to absorb the city’s sorrows as readily as the leaky pipes he fixed, hunched over a corroded pipe, his brow furrowed in concentration.  The air, thick with the smell of mildew and desperation, hung heavy in the cramped confines of the tiny workshop.  Barty’s calloused hands, stained a deep indigo from years of wrestling with rusted metal and stubborn clogs, fumbled with a wrench.  Outside, the rhythmic drumming of rain was punctuated by the distant wail of a siren, a familiar soundtrack to Barty's nightly existence.  This particular night, however, felt different.  A prickling unease, like a tiny, unwelcome rat, gnawed at the edges of his otherwise routine work.
