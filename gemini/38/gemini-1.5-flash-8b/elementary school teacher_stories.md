The chipped paint on the door of Mrs. Eleanor Ainsworth's third-grade classroom at Oakhaven Elementary School peeled away like sunburnt skin, revealing a faint, almost invisible, pattern of swirling ochre underneath.  Dust motes, illuminated by the weak afternoon sun filtering through the grimy windowpanes, danced in the air, mirroring the restless energy of the eight-year-olds crammed into the room.  Eleanor, a woman whose auburn hair was a constant battle against unruly frizz, stood at the front of the room, a worn copy of "The Very Hungry Caterpillar" balanced precariously on her stack of lesson plans.  The air, thick with the scent of crayons and slightly sour milk, hummed with the low thrum of excited whispers and the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of a hundred tiny fingers on desks. This particular Tuesday afternoon promised more of the usual chaos, only this time... something felt different.  It feltâ€¦charged.
