The flickering fluorescent lights of "Rusty Wrench Auto Repair" cast long, oily shadows across the grimy floor.  Grease, a chameleon-like substance, clung to everything â€“ the wrenches, the toolbox, even the chipped paint on the battered counter.  Outside, the rhythmic clang of a passing subway echoed through the small, cramped shop, a constant soundtrack to the whirring of the old air compressor.  This was the domain of Bartholomew "Barty" Finch, a man whose hands, calloused and scarred like ancient maps, spoke volumes of a lifetime spent wrestling with pistons and spark plugs.  The air, thick with the smell of burnt rubber and gasoline, was Barty's familiar comfort zone.  Today, however, something felt different.  Not just the unusually quiet morning, but a subtle shift in the very air itself.  A faint, metallic tang mingled with the usual fumes, a scent as peculiar as it was unsettling.
