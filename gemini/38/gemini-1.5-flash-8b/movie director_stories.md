The flickering neon sign of the "Flicker & Fade" diner cast a sickly yellow glow on Amelia Thorne's rain-slicked face.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless percussion echoing the frantic beat of her heart.  Outside, the sprawling, industrial wasteland of Neo-Kyoto sprawled beneath a bruised sky, a landscape of rusted scaffolding, towering chrome factories, and alleyways choked with discarded cybernetics.  Amelia, director Amelia Thorne, chewed the end of a nicotine-infused gum, the metallic taste a familiar companion in the face of looming deadlines and whispered threats.  Her worn leather jacket, a testament to countless nights spent navigating the labyrinthine underbelly of Neo-Kyoto, smelled faintly of burnt sugar and desperation.  Inside the diner, the air hung thick with the aroma of stale ramen and the low hum of a thousand anxieties.  She was here, at this hole-in-the-wall, attempting to find the elusive 'source' â€“ a missing character from her latest film, 'Ghost in the Gears', a cyberpunk thriller exploring the volatile intersection of technology and humanity in this dystopian metropolis.  The only clue, a cryptic note scrawled on a discarded datapad, vanished into the flickering neon. The chase was on.
