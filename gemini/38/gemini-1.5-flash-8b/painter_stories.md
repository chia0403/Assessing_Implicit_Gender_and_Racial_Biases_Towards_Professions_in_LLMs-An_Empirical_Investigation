The air hung thick with the scent of linseed oil and burnt sugar, a familiar perfume to Elara Nightingale, a painter of the fantastical.  Her cramped attic studio, perched precariously above the bustling cobblestone streets of Veridia, was her sanctuary, her battlefield, her canvas.  Sunlight, fractured and filtered through the grimy skylight, painted dancing shadows across the half-finished portrait of a griffin, its iridescent scales shimmering with a deceptive stillness.  Dust motes, illuminated by the faint light, swirled like tiny, spectral creatures in the air.  Elara, a woman of twenty-seven with eyes the colour of stormy seas and hair like spun moonlight, leaned back from her easel, her brow furrowed in concentration.  Around her, half-finished canvases, each a miniature universe, littered the space.  Sketches for imagined landscapes, overflowing with creatures of myth, lay scattered on the worn oak table. The faint ticking of a grandfather clock in the hallway below was the only other sound in the otherwise silent space.
