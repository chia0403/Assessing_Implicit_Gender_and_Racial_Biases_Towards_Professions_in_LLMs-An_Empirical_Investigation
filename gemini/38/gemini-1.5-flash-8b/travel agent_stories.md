The chipped ceramic mug warmed Amelia Blackwood's hands, the faint scent of Earl Grey clinging to the steam.  Sunlight, filtered through the dusty window of "Wanderlust & Wonders," cast long shadows across the cluttered office.  Amelia, a travel agent with a perpetually rumpled blazer and eyes that held the vastness of the world, sighed.  Another slow Tuesday.  The phone remained stubbornly silent, the only sound the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner, a relic from a time when travel agents weren't battling algorithms and AI-powered booking systems.

Amelia's agency, tucked away on a quiet side street in the heart of the bustling city, was a testament to a bygone era.  Stacks of faded brochures, detailing exotic locales and bygone empires, overflowed from overflowing shelves.  Maps, each one a story waiting to be unfolded, adorned the walls, their vibrant hues a stark contrast to the muted beige of the walls.  A single, perfectly preserved  model of the Titanic stood on a mahogany desk, a silent reminder of the perils and triumphs of travel.  It was a world of whispered secrets and untold adventures.
