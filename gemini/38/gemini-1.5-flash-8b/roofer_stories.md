The biting wind whipped Amelia "Sparrow" Finch's hair across her face, stinging her eyes as she surveyed the sprawling Victorian mansion.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron she'd climbed onto, drumming a relentless tattoo against the already groaning framework.  Below, the cobbled street of Oakhaven, a town steeped in centuries of history and whispered secrets, was swallowed by a thick, grey fog.  Every now and then, a ghostly glow from a distant lamppost pierced the gloom, casting long, dancing shadows across the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks lining the road.  Sparrow, perched precariously on a steeply pitched roof, felt a shiver that had little to do with the chill wind. This job, this roof, felt different.  It felt…heavy.

The house, known locally as Blackwood Manor, had been the source of countless hushed conversations and anxious whispers since the sudden death of its reclusive owner, Mr. Silas Blackwood, a recluse known only for his eccentric habits and even more eccentric collection of antique tools.  Sparrow, a roofer with a reputation for her resilience and uncanny ability to navigate even the most treacherous rooftops, was hired to repair the damage – or what she thought was damage – caused by the storm last week.  But beneath the layers of broken tiles and the rusting iron, something else felt amiss.  The house felt… watching.  The air thrummed with an unseen energy, a subtle hum that resonated deep within the bones of the old building.
