Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the small, weathered clinic, mimicking the relentless drumbeat of anxiety in Dr. Anya Petrova's chest.  The flickering fluorescent lights cast long, distorted shadows across the cluttered waiting room, highlighting the chipped paint and faded posters advertising stress-management techniques.  A single, threadbare armchair sat forlornly in the corner, its faded floral print a stark contrast to the peeling wallpaper.  This was the heart of the Willow Creek Community Counseling Center, a place where the quiet desperation of a small town played out in the hushed whispers of therapy sessions.  Anya, a counseling psychologist with a quiet intensity that belied her deceptively gentle demeanor, adjusted her glasses, the faint scent of chamomile tea lingering from her previous session.  Outside, the wind howled, a mournful symphony accompanying the relentless rain.  It was a typical Wednesday evening in Willow Creek, and Anya was already anticipating the storm that was about to break.
