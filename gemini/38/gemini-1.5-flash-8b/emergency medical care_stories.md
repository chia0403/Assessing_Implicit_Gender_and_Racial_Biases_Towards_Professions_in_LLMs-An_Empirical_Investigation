The biting wind whipped Amelia Hayes's coat around her legs, stinging her cheeks.  Snow, thick and relentless, obscured the already dim streetlights of the isolated mountain village.  The air, sharp and frigid, cut through her thin fleece layers.  It was a night made for staying indoors, huddled by a crackling fire.  But Amelia, EMT for the unforgiving, snow-bound hamlet of Whisperwind Peak, had a patient.  A very sick patient.

**Setting:** Whisperwind Peak, a remote, mountainous village nestled deep within the rugged peaks of the Appalachian range.  The village, almost entirely dependent on a single, winding mountain road, was blanketed in a deep winter sleep.  Heavy snowdrifts piled high against the ancient wooden buildings, their roofs almost swallowed by the white expanse.  A flickering electric current, often struggling to maintain its grip, lit the sparsely populated streets.  The biting cold seeped into the very bones, making any outside activity a challenge.
