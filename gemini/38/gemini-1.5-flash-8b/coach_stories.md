Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the "Phoenix Athletics" gymnasium, mimicking the fury brewing inside Amelia "Sparrow"  Fitzwilliam.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and sweat, hung heavy in the cramped space.  Empty water bottles lay scattered like fallen soldiers around the bleachers, testament to the grueling double-session practice.  Tonight, Sparrow wasn't just coaching the high school basketball team; she was battling a storm of her own.  Her team, the Phoenix Flyers, a scrappy bunch of underdogs, was supposed to be soaring, not sinking under the weight of their own insecurities and the whispers of doubt from the larger, more celebrated schools.  The rhythmic thump of Amelia's heart pounded in time with the frantic squeak of sneakers against the worn hardwood floor, a relentless counterpoint to the insistent drumming of the rain.
