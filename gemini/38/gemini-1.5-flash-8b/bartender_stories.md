The flickering neon sign of the "Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow over Amelia "Sunny" Hawthorne, painting her already freckled face in an ethereal light.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of moonlight slicing through the grime-coated windows, illuminating the swirling condensation on the chipped mugs lining the counter.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale beer, cheap cigarettes, and something indefinably floral, likely a stray bouquet of wilting wildflowers someone had left on a forgotten table.  This was the "Rusty Mug," a dive bar tucked away on a backstreet in the perpetually overcast city of Ashwood, a place where the regulars knew their names, and whispered stories about the moon and the shadows before the sun peeked over the industrial skyline. Tonight, the bar was eerily quiet, the only sound the rhythmic clinking of ice cubes in Amelia's glass as she meticulously measured out a shot of whiskey.  Her brow was furrowed, a familiar crease deepening with each passing second, a silent testament to the night's unspoken tension.  A lone figure sat hunched in the corner booth, their back to her, lost in a world of their own making.
