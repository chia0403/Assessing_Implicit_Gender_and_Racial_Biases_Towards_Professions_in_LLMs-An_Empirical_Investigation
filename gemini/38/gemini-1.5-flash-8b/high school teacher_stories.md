The fluorescent lights of Ms. Eleanor Vance's classroom hummed, a monotonous drone that mirrored the rhythm of her own thoughts.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grimy window, illuminating the scattered papers and half-eaten bags of chips strewn across the otherwise pristine, oak-paneled desks.  September.  The air still held the faint scent of pine and damp earth, a comforting yet melancholy aroma that clung to the quiet corners of the school.  The old brick building, a testament to a bygone era, whispered tales of countless students who had come before, their stories woven into the very fabric of the aged walls.  This year, though, felt different.  A weight, heavy and unsettling, settled upon Ms. Vance's shoulders, a feeling she couldn't quite name.  It pressed down on her chest, restricting her breath, mirroring the suffocating silence that seemed to linger in every empty classroom.
