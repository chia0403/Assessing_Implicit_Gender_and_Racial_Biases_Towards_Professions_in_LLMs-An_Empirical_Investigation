The fluorescent lights of the "Apex Solutions" reception area hummed, a monotonous drone that mirrored the rhythmic click-clack of Amelia Butterfield’s heels against the polished linoleum floor.  Rain lashed against the large panoramic windows, blurring the cityscape outside into a grey, swirling vortex.  Amelia, a petite woman with a perpetually worried frown, adjusted the oversized floral print on her name badge, “Amelia Butterfield - Reception”.  The faded, vibrant colours seemed incongruous with the overall sterile atmosphere of the office, a stark contrast to the chaotic symphony of beeps, chimes, and hushed voices that echoed through the waiting area.  A half-eaten granola bar lay abandoned on the pristine reception desk, a silent testament to the day's already dragging start.  Apex Solutions was a high-tech company that dealt in the increasingly obscure field of quantum entanglement, an area of study that seemed to Amelia like a confusing dance of subatomic particles, as frustrating as a particularly stubborn computer glitch. Today, however, it seemed to be a dance that had left her utterly disoriented.
