The rasp of Elias Thorne's plane echoed through the workshop, a rhythmic counterpoint to the insistent drip, drip, drip of water seeping from a forgotten leak in the roof.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grime-coated windows, illuminating splinters of wood scattered across the floor like fallen stars. Elias Thorne, a carpenter of considerable renown (though mostly within the confines of the impoverished East Quarter),  was hunched over a newly acquired oak beam.  He ran a calloused thumb along the smooth grain, the scent of aged wood filling his nostrils.  This was no ordinary beam; it pulsed with a subtle warmth that had Elias's attention, a warmth that he couldn't quite explain.  He was, in truth, rather bewildered by it. The beam was destined for the new Cathedral of the Rising Sun, a project demanding meticulous craftsmanship and precision, and Elias, despite his reputation, felt an unfamiliar tremor of apprehension.


**Setting:**  The East Quarter of the sprawling city of Aethelgard.  A dense, cobbled maze of narrow alleyways and towering, weathered buildings.  The sun, a pale, watery disc, struggled to pierce the perpetually grey sky, casting long shadows that stretched and twisted through the grimy streets.  The scent of roasting meats and stale ale hung heavy in the air, intermingled with the earthy aroma of damp earth and decaying leaves.  The Cathedral of the Rising Sun, a gleaming beacon of ivory and gold against the backdrop of soot-stained rooftops, stood as a stark contrast to the surrounding poverty.
