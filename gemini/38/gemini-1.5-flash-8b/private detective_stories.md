Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the "Dusty Detective Agency," a cramped storefront tucked between a pawn shop and a bakery that smelled perpetually of stale croissants.  The flickering neon sign, advertising "Solutions Found," cast a sickly yellow glow on the soaked street outside.  Inside, Amelia "Ace"  Ashworth, a private investigator with eyes the color of stormy seas and a mouth perpetually set in a thin, determined line, hunched over a stack of manila folders.  Each folder contained a different nightmare, a different desperate plea for justice lost in the labyrinthine underbelly of the city.  Tonight, however, the scent of something more pungent than stale croissants hung heavy in the airâ€”the sharp, metallic tang of blood.

The setting was the gritty, post-industrial heart of Veridian, a city where skyscrapers scraped the bruised sky and shadows stretched long and menacing.  Rain-slicked alleyways echoed with the murmur of unseen figures, and the faint, sickly sweet scent of cheap perfume mingled with the reek of exhaust fumes.  Veridian was a city built on secrets, whispers, and the relentless pursuit of something lost.  The damp, echoing silence of the city was punctuated only by the rhythmic drip, drip, drip of the rain on the corrugated iron roof above and the occasional clang of a metal object against metal deep within the darkened building next door. Tonight, Ace's investigation was about to become a descent into the very heart of the city's festering underbelly.
