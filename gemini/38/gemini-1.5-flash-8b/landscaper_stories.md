The wind, a skeletal hand, clawed at the wrought-iron gates of Blackwood Manor, rattling the ancient, ornate hinges.  Rain, the colour of pewter, hammered against the panes of the impossibly large windows, each strike echoing like a tiny drumbeat in the oppressive silence of the overgrown grounds.  This, for Elias Thornewood, was business as usual. Elias Thornewood, landscaper extraordinaire (though he preferred the simpler "groundskeeper"), surveyed the scene with a weary sigh. The once-grand estate, now a testament to neglect, lay before him, a symphony of overgrown hedges, choked pathways, and towering, skeletal trees.  His breath fogged in the frigid air, the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves thick in his nostrils.  His task, for the month, was clear: restore a semblance of order to the chaos. But the manor's ancient, brooding aura hinted at a deeper, more sinister tale concealed within its overgrown heart.
