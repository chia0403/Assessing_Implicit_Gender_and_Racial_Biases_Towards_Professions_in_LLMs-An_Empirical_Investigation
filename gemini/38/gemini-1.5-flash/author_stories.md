The salt spray stung Amelia Katherine Blackwood's face, a familiar discomfort she welcomed as a counterpoint to the stifling humidity clinging to the air like a second skin.  Amelia, or Amy as most people – save her publishers – insisted on calling her, perched precariously on the crumbling edge of the ancient stone jetty, the rhythmic crash of waves against the pilings a hypnotic metronome to her thoughts.  The sun, a molten orb sinking towards the turquoise expanse of the Aegean Sea, cast long shadows across the whitewashed buildings of Mykonos town, transforming the familiar landscape into something almost ethereal.  This wasn't the bustling, tourist-trapped Mykonos of the brochures; this was the Mykonos of hidden alleyways whispering secrets, of sun-drenched tavernas promising forgotten tastes, and of a sea that held, Amy felt certain, untold stories waiting to be unearthed.  It was here, in this forgotten corner of paradise, that she hoped to find the inspiration she so desperately needed to finish her novel, a historical fiction she'd been wrestling with for far too long.
