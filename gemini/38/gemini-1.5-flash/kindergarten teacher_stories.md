Outside, the usual boisterous playground cacophony was muted, replaced by an unnerving stillness that mirrored the classroom's hushed expectancy.  The normally vibrant mural depicting a playful farm scene seemed to watch her with unsettling intensity, each painted pig and cow somehow imbued with a silent, knowing gaze.
