The salt spray kissed Elara Vance's face as she navigated the narrow, cobbled streets of St. Ives, the wind whipping her auburn braid across her cheek.  The grey Cornish sky threatened rain, mirroring the stormy mood brewing inside her.  Elara, a registered occupational therapist with a specialty in neurological rehabilitation, hadn't anticipated the emotional toll this case would take.  The scent of brine and seaweed, usually a comforting balm, did little to soothe the knot of anxiety tightening in her stomach.  She adjusted the worn leather strap of her bag, its contents – meticulously organized therapeutic tools and a half-eaten Cornish pasty – a stark contrast to the chaotic turmoil she was about to face.  Her destination:  a secluded clifftop cottage, home to her newest patient, a renowned artist suffering from a debilitating stroke.  The dramatic, windswept landscape, usually a source of inspiration, felt today like a stark reflection of the fragility of the human spirit.
