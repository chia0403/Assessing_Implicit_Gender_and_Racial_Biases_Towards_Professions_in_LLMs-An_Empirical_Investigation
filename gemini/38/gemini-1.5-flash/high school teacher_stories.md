The chipped paint of the "Welcome to Northwood High" sign peeled away like sunburnt skin, mirroring the gradual erosion of Ms. Eleanor Vance's enthusiasm for her job.  It was a humid August afternoon in the small, perpetually drowsy town of Oakhaven, Georgia, the air thick with the scent of honeysuckle and the low thrum of cicadas.  The school itself, a sprawling brick behemoth dating back to the 1950s, loomed over the town square like a slumbering giant, its windows reflecting the oppressive heat.  Inside, the silence was broken only by the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the principal's office and the occasional creak of the aging floorboards under Ms. Vance's worn leather flats.  She stood in her classroom, sunlight slanting across the dusty desks, a half-empty mug of lukewarm coffee beside a stack of unread essays â€“ a stark reminder of the daunting mountain of paperwork that awaited her before the new school year officially began.
