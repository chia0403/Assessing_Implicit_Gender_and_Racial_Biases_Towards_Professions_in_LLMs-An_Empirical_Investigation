The brass nameplate gleamed under the low, amber light of the Atrium Hotel lobby:  *Augustus "Gus" Finch, Concierge*.  Gus Finch, however, was not gleaming.  He was slumped in his plush, mahogany desk chair, the weight of a particularly demanding guest – a platinum-haired socialite with a penchant for vintage champagne and impossible demands – pressing down on him like a lead apron.  Rain lashed against the vast panoramic windows overlooking the city, blurring the neon glow of the skyscrapers into a shimmering, indistinct watercolor.  The Atrium, a beacon of opulence nestled in the heart of the perpetually rain-slicked city of Seattle, usually hummed with a quiet, luxurious energy.  Tonight, however, it felt suffocated, mirroring the grim expression etched onto Gus's tired face.  The scent of expensive lilies, normally a comforting aroma, now seemed cloying, a fragrant reminder of the endless stream of privileged problems he navigated daily.
