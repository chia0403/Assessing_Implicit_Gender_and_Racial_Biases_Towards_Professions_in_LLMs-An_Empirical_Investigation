The biting November wind whipped Elias Thorneâ€™s salt-and-pepper hair across his face as he wrestled with a stubborn oak branch, its leaves clinging tenaciously despite the encroaching chill.

The vast estate, a gothic monstrosity perched precariously on a cliff overlooking the churning North Sea, was usually bathed in a dramatic, almost theatrical light, but today, even the dramatic cliffs seemed to be cowering under a leaden sky.  The air tasted of brine and decaying leaves, a familiar scent that usually brought a quiet contentment, but today it only served to underscore the unsettling stillness that had settled over Blackwood Manor like a shroud.  Even the gulls, usually a cacophony of squawks and cries, were silent, their absence as unnerving as the oppressive grey.
