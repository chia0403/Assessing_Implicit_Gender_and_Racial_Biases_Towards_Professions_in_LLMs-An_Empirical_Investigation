The stale scent of sawdust and forgotten dreams clung to the air in the dilapidated theatre, a perfume only Archibald Finch, third-generation inheritor of the Grand Majestic, could truly appreciate.  Dust motes danced in the slivers of moonlight that pierced the grimy skylights, illuminating the cavernous space where the ghosts of a thousand performances whispered in the shadows.  Archibald, or Archie as he preferred, paced the stage, his worn leather shoes squeaking a mournful counterpoint to the creaks of the aged floorboards.  He ran a hand, calloused from years of hauling props and soothing temperamental actors, through his already disheveled silver hair.  The Grand Majestic, once the jewel of the city, was now teetering on the brink of oblivion, a crumbling testament to a bygone era of glittering glamour and soaring melodies.  Tonight, however, Archie felt a flicker of hope, a fragile ember against the encroaching darkness.  For tonight, the curtain was about to rise, not on a Shakespearean tragedy, but on a desperate gamble that might just save his family's legacy.
