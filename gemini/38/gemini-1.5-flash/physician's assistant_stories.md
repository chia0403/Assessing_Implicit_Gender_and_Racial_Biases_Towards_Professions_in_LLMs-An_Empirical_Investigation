The biting wind whipped Amelia “Mia” Hernandez’s dark hair across her face as she wrestled the heavy oak door of the clinic open.  The scent of antiseptic and pine – a strangely comforting blend – hit her immediately, a familiar counterpoint to the raw, icy breath of the Alaskan winter howling outside.  The small, single-story building, perched precariously on the edge of Juneau, looked more like a stranded fishing shack than a medical facility, its weathered grey siding patched haphazardly with planks of varying shades.  Inside, the air was warmer, a welcome relief, but the chill lingered, clinging to the worn linoleum floor and the slightly frayed edges of the faded floral wallpaper.  The only sound was the rhythmic tick-tock of an ancient grandfather clock in the waiting room, its pendulum swinging with a mournful cadence that mirrored the uneasy feeling settling in Mia’s stomach.  This wasn't her usual bustling city clinic; this was remote, rugged, and she was bracing herself for whatever lay beyond the reception desk.
