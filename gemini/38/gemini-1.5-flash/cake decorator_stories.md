The air hung thick and sweet in "The Flour Child," a bakery so crammed with sugary delights it felt less like a shop and more like a whimsical, edible labyrinth.  Cinnamon and vanilla battled for dominance with the sharp tang of lemon curd, a perfume only slightly less intoxicating than the buttercream roses meticulously piped onto the three-tiered wedding cake dominating the center island.  Amelia Katherine Hawthorne, her hands dusted a delicate shade of powdered sugar, delicately swirled a final, perfect rosette onto a vibrant crimson poppy.  The late afternoon sun, filtering through the dusty lace curtains, cast long shadows across the flour-dusted countertops, highlighting the fine lines etched around Amelia’s eyes – lines earned not from age, but from countless hours spent coaxing beauty from buttercream and fondant.  Outside, the bustling city of Charleston hummed with life, but inside The Flour Child, time seemed to slow, measured only by the rhythmic click of Amelia’s decorating bag and the soft whir of the nearby mixer.
