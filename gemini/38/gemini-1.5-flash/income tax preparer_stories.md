The fluorescent lights of Mildred McMillan's Tax Services hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the annual avalanche of paperwork threatening to bury Mildred herself.  Dust motes, illuminated like tiny, glittering stars in the harsh glare, danced in the air above stacks of 1040s, W-2s, and the occasional forlorn-looking K-1.

Outside, the March wind howled a mournful counterpoint to the whirring of Mildredâ€™s ancient computer, a beige behemoth that had witnessed countless tax seasons and more than its fair share of panicked client meltdowns.  This year, however, felt different.  A palpable tension hung in the air, thicker than the dust, heavier than the anxieties of her clients.  Mildred McMillan, a woman whose life revolved around the meticulous balancing of debits and credits, felt a premonition bloom in her chest, as unsettling as an unexpected audit notice.
