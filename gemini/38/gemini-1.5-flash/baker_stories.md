The aroma of cardamom and orange blossom hung heavy in the air, a fragrant fog clinging to the cobblestone streets of Marrakech.  Dust motes, illuminated by the weak winter sun, danced in the shafts of light filtering through the arched doorways of the souk.  For Elara Zahra Ben Youssef, the scent was as familiar and comforting as her own heartbeat.  It was the scent of home, the scent of her bakery, "Le Pain Dor√©,"  a tiny oasis of warmth tucked away on a quiet side street, just off the bustling Djemaa el-Fna square.  The bell above the door, a tarnished silver disc, chimed a melancholic tune as a stray cat, its fur the colour of burnt cinnamon, slipped inside, seeking refuge from the encroaching chill.  Elara, flour dusting her already smudged apron, barely registered its presence.  Her mind was elsewhere, lost in the intricate swirls of dough she was shaping, preparing for the day's bread.
