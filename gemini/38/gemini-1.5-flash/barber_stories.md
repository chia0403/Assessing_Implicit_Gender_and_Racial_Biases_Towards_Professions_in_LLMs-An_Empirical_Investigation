The scent of Bay Rum and stale coffee hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume that clung to Elias Thorne like a second skin.  Elias, owner and sole operator of Thorneâ€™s Traditional Barbershop, ran a damp cloth over the already gleaming chrome of his antique barber's chair. Dust motes danced in the weak afternoon sun that slanted through the grimy window of his shop, illuminating the faded floral wallpaper and the chipped porcelain mugs perched precariously on a shelf behind him. Outside, the relentless rhythm of city traffic pulsed like a distant, throbbing heart, a stark contrast to the quiet, almost meditative atmosphere within Thorne's.  The shop, nestled on a forgotten corner of Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village, had seen better days, but it held a certain melancholic charm, a testament to a bygone era of slow, deliberate craftsmanship.  Elias sighed, the sound barely audible above the hum of the refrigerator in the back room. Another slow day, he thought, another day spent battling the encroaching tide of modern, soulless hair salons.
