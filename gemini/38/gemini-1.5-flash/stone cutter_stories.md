The rasp of granite against steel echoed through the cavernous workshop, a counterpoint to the rhythmic clang of Jasper Thorne's hammer.  Dust, fine as powdered sugar, motes in the single shaft of sunlight slicing through the grimy window, hung suspended in the air, a shimmering halo around him.  Jasper, his face grimy but his eyes sharp and focused, worked with the steady precision of a seasoned craftsman, his calloused hands moving with a practiced grace that belied the raw power behind each blow.  The air smelled of wet stone, iron filings, and the faint, lingering scent of woodsmoke from the forge nestled in a shadowed corner.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune around the granite cliffs that dominated the bleak, windswept coastline of Cornwall, a constant, untamed presence that mirrored the wildness in Jasper's own heart. This was his sanctuary, his world: a rough-hewn stone workshop perched precariously on the edge of the world.
