The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s auburn hair across her face as she hurried down the cobblestone street.  Rain, a fine, persistent drizzle, plastered her tailored coat to her back.  The gas lamps of  Charleston, South Carolina, cast a hazy, amber glow on the ancient, moss-draped oaks lining the street, their branches skeletal against the bruised twilight sky. Amelia, a physical therapist with a reputation as sharp as her wit, tugged her scarf tighter around her neck, the damp chill seeping into her bones despite the layers.  Her destination: the imposing, antebellum mansion looming at the end of the street, its darkened windows like vacant eyes staring out into the storm.  It was here, within those shadowed walls, that her latest patient – a reclusive, enigmatic artist named Silas Blackwood – awaited her.  The scent of jasmine, even in the rain, hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the unease tightening in Amelia’s chest.  This wasn't just another case; something about Silas Blackwood, and the shadowed history clinging to his mansion, felt profoundly…wrong.
