The fluorescent lights of Sterling & Thorne hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Grace Hawthorne's otherwise silent existence.  Dust motes, illuminated like tiny galaxies, danced in the stale air above the polished mahogany reception desk.  Amelia, perched on her ergonomically correct but decidedly uncomfortable chair, meticulously organised the already pristine pile of brochures, the faint scent of lemon polish clinging to her fingertips. Outside, the London drizzle pattered against the panoramic window, blurring the sharp lines of the city skyline into a watercolour impression of grey and steel.  Inside, the air hung thick with the unspoken anxieties of a thousand pending deals and the ever-present hum of corporate life.  It was 8:03 AM, and Amelia already felt the familiar weight of another day settling upon her shoulders, a weight both predictable and profoundly unsettling.
