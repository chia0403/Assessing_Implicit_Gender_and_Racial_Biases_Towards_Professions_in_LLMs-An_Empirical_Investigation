The chipped Formica tabletop felt slick beneath Amelia Hernandez's fingertips as she wiped it down for the tenth time in as many minutes.  The air in the "Rusty Mug Diner" hung thick with the smell of stale coffee, burnt bacon, and a faint, underlying aroma of desperation â€“ a scent Amelia had come to recognize as the lingering perfume of another slow Tuesday night.  Rain lashed against the dusty windows of the diner, blurring the already indistinct neon glow of the "OPEN" sign into a hazy, orange smear.  Inside, the only sounds were the rhythmic hiss of the coffee machine and the low hum of the refrigerator, punctuated by the occasional, mournful clink of Amelia's own silverware against the worn steel tray.  This was her kingdom, a greasy spoon kingdom of lukewarm coffee and weary faces, and tonight, it felt particularly bleak.
