The biting Antarctic wind howled a mournful symphony around Dr. Aris Thorne's research station, a lonely outpost clinging precariously to the ice shelf like a barnacle on a whale.  Ice crystals, sharp as shards of glass, whipped across the desolate landscape, blurring the already indistinct horizon.  The air, thin and frigid, tasted of ozone and the faint, metallic tang of blood – a smell Aris had, unfortunately, become accustomed to over the past six months.  He hunched deeper into his thermal parka, the thick fabric doing little to quell the persistent shiver that ran down his spine. It wasn't just the cold; a gnawing unease had settled in his gut, a feeling far more chilling than the Antarctic winter itself.  Tonight, something felt…different.  The usual rhythmic creak and groan of the ice seemed to carry a sinister undertone, a whisper of something vast and unseen stirring beneath the frozen surface.
