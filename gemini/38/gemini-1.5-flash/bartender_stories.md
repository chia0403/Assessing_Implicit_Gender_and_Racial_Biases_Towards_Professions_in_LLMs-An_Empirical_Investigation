The chipped Formica countertop felt cold beneath Elias Thorne's fingertips as he meticulously polished a already spotless glass.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows of "The Rusty Mug," blurring the neon glow of the liquor store across the street into a hazy, shimmering smear.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale beer, spilled whiskey, and the faint, metallic tang of regret â€“ a perfume Elias had grown accustomed to over his ten years behind the bar.  Tonight, however, the usual Friday night buzz was absent, replaced by a gnawing silence punctuated only by the rhythmic drip, drip, drip of a leaky faucet somewhere in the back.  Even the jukebox, usually a vibrant heartbeat of the establishment, sat stubbornly quiet, its illuminated panels mocking the emptiness of the room.  Outside, the wind howled a lonely tune, a mournful counterpoint to the desolate scene within.
