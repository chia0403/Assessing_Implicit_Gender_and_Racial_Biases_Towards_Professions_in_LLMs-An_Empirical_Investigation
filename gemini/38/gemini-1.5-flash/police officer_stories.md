The salt spray stung Officer Amelia "Mia" Hernandez's face as the November wind whipped through the skeletal remains of the old fishing pier.  Grey, churning waves slammed against the decaying pilings, their rhythmic roar a counterpoint to the mournful cry of gulls overhead.  The air hung thick with the smell of brine and something else… something metallic and faintly sweet, a scent that clung to the back of Mia's throat like the taste of blood.  She pulled her threadbare wool scarf tighter around her neck, the flimsy fabric offering little protection against the biting wind that threatened to rip her uniform jacket from her shoulders.  Below, the inky black water of the Atlantic churned restlessly, swallowing the last slivers of fading daylight. This was Havenwood, Maine, a town beautiful enough to break your heart, and tonight, it was holding a secret close to its chest – a secret Mia Hernandez was determined to uncover.
