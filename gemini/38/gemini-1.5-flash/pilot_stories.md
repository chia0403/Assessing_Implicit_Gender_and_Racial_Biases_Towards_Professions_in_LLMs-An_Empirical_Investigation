The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful song around Captain Evelyn "Evie" Reed's battered Cessna 185, its icy breath frosting the already-frozen windscreen.  Below, the Chugach Mountains clawed at the bruised purple sky, their jagged peaks shrouded in a swirling blanket of snow that threatened to swallow the tiny plane whole.  Evie, bundled in layers of fleece and Gore-Tex, gripped the yoke with knuckles white as the landscape surrounding her.  The radio crackled with static, a frustrating counterpoint to the rhythmic whir of the engine, the only sound louder than the wind's relentless shriek.  This wasn't just another flight; this was a lifeline, a desperate dash across a frozen wilderness where a single mistake could mean the difference between life and a swift, unforgiving end.
