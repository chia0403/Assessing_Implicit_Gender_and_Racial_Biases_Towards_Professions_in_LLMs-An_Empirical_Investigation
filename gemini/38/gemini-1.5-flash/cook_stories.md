The salt spray stung Amelia Katherine “Amy” Finch’s face as she hauled the last crate of oysters onto the deck of the *Sea Serpent*.  The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum in the churning grey sky, cast long shadows across the bobbing fishing boats in the harbour of Port Blossom, a town clinging precariously to the jagged cliffs of the Cornish coast. The air, thick with the smell of brine and seaweed, was punctuated by the cries of gulls and the rhythmic thud of waves against the harbour wall. Amy, her hands raw and chapped despite thick gloves, straightened, a grimace twisting her lips.  This was her life – a constant battle against the elements, a rhythm of hard work and the unpredictable bounty of the sea, all for the sake of her small, but fiercely loyal, clientele at The Mariner's Rest, the only restaurant in town.
