The relentless Florida sun beat down on Amelia Hernandez’s shoulders, turning the already stifling air inside her beat-up Corolla into a humid oven.  Sweat beaded on her forehead, blurring the already smudged map spread across the passenger seat. Amelia, a seasoned real estate salesperson with a reputation for closing deals even in the face of hurricane-force winds (metaphorically speaking, mostly), squinted at the address scribbled in faded blue ink.  Palm trees swayed languidly in the distance, their fronds rustling like whispers against the relentless drone of cicadas.  The destination: a sprawling, slightly dilapidated mansion nestled deep within the overgrown, almost jungle-like, fringes of Boca Raton.  This wasn't her usual clientele – the high-roller beach-front condos were her bread and butter – but desperation, like the Florida humidity, clung to everything, especially her dwindling commission checks.  This house, however, held the potential to change everything.
