The scent of rosemary and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume only Aurelia "Rella" Nightingale could concoct.  Rella, perched on a worn, velvet stool behind the antique barber's chair in her tiny salon, "Snip & Sip,"  carefully applied a streak of honey-blonde highlight to Mrs. Periwinkle's already aggressively platinum bob.  Rain lashed against the single, mismatched windowpane of the shop, a rhythmic counterpoint to the whirring of the ancient hairdryer humming in the corner.  Snip & Sip, tucked away on a cobbled side street in the perpetually damp, eternally charming town of Seabrook, was as much a haven for gossiping locals as it was a place for a stylish cut.  The walls, painted a faded seafoam green, were adorned with faded photographs of past clients, their smiles frozen in time, alongside shelves overflowing with brightly coloured hair dye tubes and an eclectic collection of chipped teacups.  Tonight, however, the usual cheerful chatter was muted, the storm outside mirroring the uneasy silence that had settled over Seabrook since the disappearance of young Thomas Ashton a week ago.
