The air hung thick and sweet with the cloying scent of coconut oil and burnt sugar – a perfume unique to the island of Avani and its eclectic salon, "Shear Serenity."  Sunlight, fractured by the palm fronds that scraped against the corrugated iron roof, dappled the worn wooden floorboards.  Dust motes danced in the shafts of light, illuminated like tiny, golden fireflies.  Amelia “Mia” Hernandez, her fingers nimble and quick, worked with the precision of a surgeon, shaping a cascade of thick, raven hair into a perfectly sculpted bob.  The rhythmic snip-snip-snip of her shears was the only sound louder than the gentle lapping of turquoise waves against the shore, just visible through the open doorway.
