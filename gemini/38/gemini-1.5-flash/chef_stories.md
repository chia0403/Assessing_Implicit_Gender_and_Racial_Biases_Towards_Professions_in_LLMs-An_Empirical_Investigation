The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of frying garlic and simmering spices, a fragrant counterpoint to the acrid tang of seawater clinging to everything in the tiny coastal town of Port Blossom.  Chef  Isabelle “Izzy” Moreau, her usually vibrant auburn hair plastered damply to her forehead, wrestled a recalcitrant lobster onto a cutting board.  The worn, wooden surface, slick with years of spilled olive oil and the ghosts of a thousand meals, groaned under the crustacean's struggles.  Outside, the relentless Pacific beat against the pilings supporting Izzy's restaurant, *Le Petit Crabe*, a charmingly dilapidated shack that somehow managed to exude both rustic charm and imminent collapse. Tonight, however, collapse was the least of Izzy's worries.  The annual Port Blossom Seafood Festival was just hours away, and her star dish – a daring lobster bisque with saffron and sea bean foam – was threatening to become a culinary catastrophe.
