The chipped paint of Dr. Eleanor Vance’s waiting room was a familiar shade of institutional beige, a hue that somehow managed to absorb both light and hope.  Rain lashed against the tall, gothic windows of her Victorian practice, a rhythmic drumming that mirrored the anxious tapping of her own foot beneath the mahogany desk.  The scent of old books and faintly floral air freshener hung heavy in the air, a peculiar blend that Eleanor had come to associate with the weight of other people’s sorrows.  This Wednesday afternoon, however, felt heavier than most.  The usually calming presence of her overflowing bookshelf – filled with dog-eared volumes on trauma, attachment, and the intricacies of the human psyche – offered little solace.  The storm outside matched the tempest brewing inside her, a disquiet that had nothing to do with the upcoming case files and everything to do with the unsettling phone call she’d received just an hour ago.
