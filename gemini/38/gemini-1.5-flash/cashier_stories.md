The fluorescent lights of "Quick Stop Mart" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Hernandez's Tuesday evening.  The air hung thick with the cloying sweetness of cheap air freshener, battling the more pungent aroma of stale coffee and something vaguely resembling week-old fish. Amelia, perched on her stool behind the chipped Formica counter, absently tapped her fingernails against the worn surface.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the already indistinct view of the deserted gas station across the street.  Outside, the only sound louder than the relentless drumming rain was the occasional mournful wail of a passing siren, a siren song of a city struggling to sleep.  Inside, it was just Amelia, the flickering lottery ticket display, and the rhythmic beep of the scanner, a mechanical metronome marking the slow, steady passage of time.
