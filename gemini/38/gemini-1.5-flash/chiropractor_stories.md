The biting November wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vance's auburn hair across her face as she hurried across the deserted town square of Havenwood, the collar of her wool coat pulled high.  Havenwood, population 873 (give or take a stray dog and a couple of itinerant salesmen), nestled in a valley carved deep into the Appalachian Mountains, was usually picturesque.  But tonight, under a sky the colour of bruised plums, it felt isolated, almost menacing.  The only sound louder than the wind was the rhythmic creak of the old wooden sign hanging askew above her chiropractic clinic – "VANCE CHIROPRACTIC –  Relief from the Neck Up (and Down!)" – a testament to both her profession and the slightly folksy nature of her clientele.  The flickering gaslights cast long, distorted shadows that danced with the restless wind, making even the familiar buildings seem alien and threatening.  Eleanor tugged her scarf tighter, a prickle of unease crawling down her spine.  It wasn't just the weather; something felt…off.
