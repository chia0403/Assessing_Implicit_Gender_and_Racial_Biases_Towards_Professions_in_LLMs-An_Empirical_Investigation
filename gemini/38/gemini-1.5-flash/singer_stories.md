The salt spray stung Seraphina "Sera" Nightingale's face as she braced herself against the railing of the *Sea Serpent*, a battered fishing trawler repurposed as a floating music venue.  The air, thick with the smell of brine and diesel, vibrated with the low thrum of the aging engine and the anticipatory murmur of the crowd gathered on the rickety wooden deck.

Below, the churning water, reflecting the shimmering lights of Mykonos in the distance, mirrored the nervous flutter in Sera's stomach.  This wasn't some polished concert hall; this was raw, untamed, and utterly, breathtakingly, hers.
