The grease-stained overalls of Elias Thorne felt like a second skin, a comforting weight against the chill October wind whipping through the cavernous bays of Thorne's Auto.  Leaves, the color of bruised plums and decaying embers, swirled across the cracked asphalt of the yard, clinging to the rusted chassis of a forgotten Ford pickup.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of burnt oil, anti-freeze, and something vaguely floral â€“ probably the air freshener Mrs. Gable from down the street had gifted him last Christmas, a gesture he appreciated even if the sickly sweet smell did little to mask the pervasive aroma of his profession.  Thorne's Auto, nestled precariously between a liquor store with perpetually broken windows and a laundromat that perpetually smelled of dryer sheets and despair, wasn't much to look at, but it was Elias's kingdom.  And tonight, the kingdom felt unusually quiet, the usual cacophony of whirring engines and hammering replaced by an unsettling stillness.
