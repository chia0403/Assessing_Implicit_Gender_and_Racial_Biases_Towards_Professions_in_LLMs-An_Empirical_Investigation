Professor Eleanor Vance, PhD, adjusted her spectacles, the faint scent of old parchment and pipe tobacco clinging to the lenses.  Rain lashed against the leaded-glass windows of her study, a relentless drumming that mirrored the frantic hammering of her own heart.  The study itself was a chaotic symphony of scholarship: towering shelves crammed with leather-bound books threatened to topple under their own weight, overflowing with knowledge both ancient and arcane.  Half-finished manuscripts lay scattered across a mahogany desk burdened by a weighty brass lamp, its light struggling to pierce the gloom.  Beyond the rain-streaked panes, the ancient oaks of Blackwood Manor clawed at the stormy sky, their branches skeletal fingers against a bruised purple twilight.  Tonight, however, the storm raging outside was nothing compared to the one brewing within Eleanor's soul.
