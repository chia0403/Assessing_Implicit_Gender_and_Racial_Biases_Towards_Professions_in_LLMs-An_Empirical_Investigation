The biting wind howled a mournful tune across the desolate plains of Montana, whipping snow into frenzied spirals that obscured the already fading twilight.  Ice, thick as a blacksmith's hammer, clung to the grill of Earl "Dusty" Rhodes' eighteen-wheeler, the frosty breath of the engine barely enough to keep the windshield clear.  Dusty, his face weathered like an old saddlebag, gripped the steering wheel of his rig, *The Wandering Star*, its chrome gleaming faintly under the bruised purple sky.  The highway, US-93, stretched before him like a ribbon of black ice, disappearing into the heart of a blizzard that felt capable of swallowing the world whole.  His CB radio crackled with static, a counterpoint to the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the tires battling the unforgiving terrain. Tonight, the only warmth Dusty found was in the lukewarm coffee cooling in his thermos and the faint glow of the dashboard lights, illuminating the miles still to go before he could reach the shelter of Butte.
