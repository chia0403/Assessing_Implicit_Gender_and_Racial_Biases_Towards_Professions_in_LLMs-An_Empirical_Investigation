Dust motes, illuminated like tiny stars in the dim light, danced in the sluggish air, a silent testament to the hotel's slow decline.  The once-grand marble floors were now stained and chipped, the plush carpets worn thin in places, revealing glimpses of the original parquet beneath.  A faint scent of lavender, clinging desperately to the faded tapestries, battled with the pervasive odor of stale cigars and forgotten ambitions.  Tonight, however, the usual quiet melancholia of the Grand Majestic was punctuated by an unsettling stillness â€“ a silence thicker than the dust, more unnerving than the usual creaks and groans of a dying building.
