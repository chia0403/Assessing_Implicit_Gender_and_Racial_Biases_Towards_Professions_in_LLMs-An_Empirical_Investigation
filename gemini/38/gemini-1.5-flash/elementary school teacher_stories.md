The chipped paint of Mrs. Eleanor Vance's classroom desk felt rough beneath her fingertips, a familiar texture that mirrored the gravelly scratch in her throat.  Dust motes, illuminated by the weak November sun struggling through the grimy windowpanes of Maplewood Elementary, danced in the stillness of the empty room.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the ancient oak tree whose branches clawed at the brick fa√ßade of the building.  Inside, a single, flickering fluorescent light buzzed incessantly, the only sound louder than the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the hall, its pendulum a metronome keeping time for the creeping loneliness that had settled over Eleanor since the last bell had rung.  The scent of chalk dust and old paper hung heavy in the air, a familiar aroma that, tonight, felt less comforting and more like a suffocating blanket.
