The scent of lilies, sharp and sweet, hung heavy in the air, a counterpoint to the damp chill clinging to the cobblestones of Willow Creek.  Rain, a fine, persistent drizzle, plastered Amelia Hawthorne's auburn curls to her forehead.  Her breath plumed out in small white clouds as she unlocked the heavy oak door of "Petals & Promises," her flower shop, a charmingly dilapidated Victorian building nestled between a crooked bookshop and a bakery that perpetually smelled of warm cinnamon.  Inside, the air was a fragrant explosion of roses, jasmine, and the earthy perfume of freshly cut stems.  The flickering gaslight cast long shadows across the vibrant blooms, illuminating the chaos – a beautiful, fragrant chaos – that was Amelia's life.
