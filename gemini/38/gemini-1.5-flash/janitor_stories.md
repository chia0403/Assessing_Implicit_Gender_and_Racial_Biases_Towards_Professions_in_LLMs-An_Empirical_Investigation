The fluorescent lights of the Blackwood Academy hummed a discordant tune, their sickly yellow glow reflecting off the polished linoleum floor.  Dust motes, disturbed by the slow, deliberate sweep of Elias Thorne's mop, danced in the weak beams like tiny, frantic fireflies.  Elias, a man whose life was measured in the rhythmic swish of his mop and the quiet squeak of his worn-out shoes, was alone, as usual, in the cavernous emptiness of the school after hours. The scent of lemon cleaner fought a losing battle against the lingering aroma of old textbooks, chalk dust, and the faint, almost imperceptible tang of teenage desperation that clung to the very walls of Blackwood Academy.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful song, rattling the ancient gothic windows, a stark contrast to the sterile, almost antiseptic quiet within.  Tonight, however, the usual stillness was punctuated by an unnerving silence â€“ a silence deeper than the usual nocturnal hush of the academy.
