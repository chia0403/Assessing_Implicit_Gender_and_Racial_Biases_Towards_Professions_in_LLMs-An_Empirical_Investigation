The recycled air hung thick and faintly metallic, a familiar perfume to Amelia Katherine Stone.  Amelia, or Amy as most passengers called her – though she much preferred the formality of her full name in the sterile environment of 30,000 feet – adjusted her crisp, navy-blue uniform, the tiny silver wings pinned above her breast a weightless counterpoint to the simmering tension in the cabin.  Outside, the inky blackness of the Atlantic stretched endlessly, punctuated only by the occasional wink of a distant star.  Flight BA249, London Heathrow to New York JFK, was less than an hour from its scheduled arrival, but the air buzzed with an unspoken unease, a low hum of anxiety vibrating beneath the drone of the engines.  The usual pre-landing bustle – the rustling of newspapers, the clatter of trays – was absent, replaced by a heavy, unsettling silence, broken only by the rhythmic sigh of the plane itself, a metal beast breathing its last breaths before touching down.  Amy scanned the faces of the passengers, her trained eye picking out the subtle shifts in posture, the clenching of fists, the nervous twitch of a jaw. Something was wrong, profoundly wrong, and she knew, with a sickening certainty, that it had nothing to do with turbulence.
