The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the Rusty Mug, a rhythm that mirrored the pounding in Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's temples.  Neon signs advertising long-defunct breweries flickered intermittently through the grime-streaked window, casting a sickly yellow glow across the almost empty bar. Salt spray, whipped in from the churning Atlantic just a block away, clung to everything, coating the cracked vinyl barstools and leaving a gritty residue on Amy's fingertips.  Port Blossom, Maine, population dwindling, was a town clinging to the frayed edges of the map, and the Rusty Mug, with its peeling paint and lingering scent of stale beer, was its equally tenacious heart. Tonight, however, even that heart seemed to beat a little weaker than usual. Only two patrons huddled at the far end of the bar, their faces obscured by the shadows and the rising steam from their mugs.  A nor'easter was brewing, both outside and, Amy suspected, within herself.
