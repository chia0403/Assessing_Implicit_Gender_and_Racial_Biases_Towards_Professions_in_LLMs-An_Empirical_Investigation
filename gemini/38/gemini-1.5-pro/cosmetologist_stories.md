The pungent aroma of perm solution hung in the air, a familiar perfume that Genevieve "Gigi" Dubois barely registered anymore.  It mingled with the sweet scent of hairspray and the low hum of the dryers, creating the unique symphony of "Shear Radiance," the salon Gigi owned and operated in the heart of Magnolia Springs, Mississippi.  The town was small, nestled amidst rolling hills dotted with pecan trees and antebellum homes, their paint peeling like sunburnt skin.  Magnolia Springs moved at a slower pace than most places, a rhythm punctuated by the chirp of cicadas in summer and the rustle of falling leaves in autumn.  This Wednesday morning, however, a different kind of electricity crackled in the air.  The arrival of the "Hollywood Hair Extravaganza" tour bus – emblazoned with a larger-than-life photo of celebrity stylist, Ricardo Valentino – had disrupted the usual tranquility, and Gigi, perched on a rolling stool behind the reception desk, felt a knot of anticipation tighten in her stomach.
