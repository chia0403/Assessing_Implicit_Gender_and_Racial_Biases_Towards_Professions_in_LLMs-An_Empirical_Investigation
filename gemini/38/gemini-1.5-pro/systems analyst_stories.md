Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of the Zephyr Holdings building, forty stories above a rain-slicked Chicago.  Inside, the air thrummed with the low hum of servers and the frantic tap-tap-tapping of keyboards.  Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the rows of identical cubicles.  Eleanor Vance, a systems analyst with a reputation for untangling the most knotted digital Gordian knots, hunched over her monitor, her brow furrowed in concentration.  Lines of code, glowing green against a black background, scrolled across the screen like an esoteric, digital river.  A half-empty mug of lukewarm coffee sat beside her, a testament to the hours she’d already poured into this particular problem.  Zephyr’s entire internal network had been experiencing intermittent outages for the past week, and Eleanor was the only one who seemed capable of even beginning to diagnose the issue.  The pressure was mounting, and the rhythmic drumming of the rain against the glass only served to amplify the tension that crackled in the air.
