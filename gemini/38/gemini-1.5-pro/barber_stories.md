The rusty squeak of the barber chair was as familiar to Elias Finch as his own heartbeat. It punctuated the quiet rhythm of his mornings in the sleepy town of Harmony Creek, nestled deep in the Appalachian foothills.  Elias's Barbershop, a small, wood-paneled building sandwiched between Miss Patty's bakery and a perpetually closed antique store, was the repository of Harmony Creek's secrets, whispered over the snip of scissors and the hum of clippers. The large front window, etched with faded gold lettering proclaiming "Elias Finch - Tonsorial Artist," offered a view of the town square, where the centerpiece, a weathered bronze statue of a fiddler, perpetually gazed across Main Street.  The air, thick with the sweet scent of honeysuckle from the vines clinging to the barbershop's porch, usually carried the distant murmur of the creek, but this morning, a different kind of stillness hung in the air, a stillness that prickled the hairs on the back of Elias's neck.
