The rusty hinges of the Clip Joint Salon groaned a mournful tune as Elias Finch unlocked the door, the sound swallowed by the thick, humid Charleston air.  Spanish moss, draped like forgotten scarves on the live oaks lining Meeting Street, dripped with the previous night's rain.  It was barely 7am, but the sun already beat down with a ferocity that promised a scorcher. Elias, his white linen shirt already clinging to his back, flipped the switch, illuminating the salon's faded grandeur.  Dust motes danced in the single beam of sunlight that pierced through the grimy window, highlighting the worn leather chairs and the chipped porcelain sink.  The air inside still held the faint, sweet scent of yesterday's perm solution, mingling with the ever-present aroma of Elias's own cologne, a blend of sandalwood and citrus he'd concocted himself.  He surveyed his domain, a kingdom built on split ends and unruly curls, and sighed. Another day, another dollar, another chance to snip away the worries of Charleston's elite, one perfectly angled bob at a time.
