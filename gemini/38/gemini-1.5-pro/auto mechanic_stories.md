The biting November wind whipped through the open bay doors of Rusty's Rods and Repairs, swirling dust devils across the cracked concrete floor.  Grease-stained calendars, pin-up girls yellowed with age, peeled from the cinderblock walls.  The scent of motor oil, burnt rubber, and stale coffee hung heavy in the air.  Florence "Flo" Amelia Hayes, her auburn hair pulled back in a messy bun beneath a faded baseball cap, wiped a smudge of grime from her cheek with the back of her hand, revealing a streak of grease that simply blended in with the rest.  She squinted at the stubborn bolt on the '67 Mustang fastback hoisted above her, a wrench clutched in her hand. The engine, gutted and exposed like a dissected frog, seemed to mock her with its intricate complexity.  Outside, the skeletal branches of an old oak tree clawed at the overcast sky above the small, rural town of Havenwood, Pennsylvania, population 842, and falling.  Winter was coming, and Flo knew this Mustang, her current project, had to be running before the first snow fell.
