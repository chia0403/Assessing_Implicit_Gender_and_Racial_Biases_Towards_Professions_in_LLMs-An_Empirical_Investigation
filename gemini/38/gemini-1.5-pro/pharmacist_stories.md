The relentless drizzle of a Seattle November clung to the air like a damp grey blanket, mirroring the persistent ache in Elias Thorne's lower back.  Emerald City Pharmacy, nestled between a perpetually-closed antique shop and a bustling pho restaurant, hummed with the low murmur of fluorescent lights and the rhythmic beeping of the prescription-filling machine.  Elias, his name tag pinned slightly askew on his crisp white coat, meticulously counted out tiny, pale blue pills, the scent of antiseptic and something faintly sweet – perhaps the lingering ghost of Mrs. Henderson’s rosewater perfume – filling the air.  Outside, the neon glow of the "Open" sign reflected in the rain-slicked streets, a beacon in the gathering dusk, promising relief, remedy, and maybe even a little human connection in a city that often felt as cold and impersonal as the steel sky above.
