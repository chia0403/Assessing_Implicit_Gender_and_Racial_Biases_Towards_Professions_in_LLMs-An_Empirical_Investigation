The bell above the door of "Nailed It," a tiny salon squeezed between a laundromat and a perpetually closed bakery, chimed a discordant welcome. Rain lashed against the window, blurring the neon "OPEN" sign into a hazy smear. Inside, Eliza June Hawthorne, her name stitched in elegant cursive on the pocket of her denim apron, sighed and capped the bottle of "Midnight Merlot" she'd been meticulously applying to a client's nails. The client, a woman with a voice like gravel and hair the colour of dandelion fluff, had abruptly declared a nail emergency – a chipped pinky – and fled, promising to return later with cash. Eliza doubted she would. The salon, usually buzzing with the low hum of dryers and the rhythmic snip of her cuticle scissors, was now silent save for the drumming rain and the faint, metallic tang of acetone hanging in the air. Dusk was settling over the small, coastal town of Port Blossom, casting long shadows across the empty pedicure chairs and reflecting in the myriad bottles of polish lining the walls like jewels.
