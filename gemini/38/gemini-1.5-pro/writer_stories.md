The salt spray kissed Amelia Zephyr Thorne's face as she leaned against the weathered railing of her porch, the rhythmic crash of waves against the rocky Cornish coast a familiar lullaby.  Perched atop a windswept cliff overlooking the churning Atlantic, her cottage, "Seawhisper," was a ramshackle affair of grey stone and slate, its garden a tangle of sea thrift and wind-battered roses.  Inside, the aroma of woodsmoke and brewing tea mingled with the scent of old books and the faint, salty tang of the sea air that permeated everything. Amelia, wrapped in a thick, knitted shawl the colour of a stormy sky, sipped her tea and watched the sun bleed crimson into the vast expanse of ocean.  Her latest manuscript lay open on the small table beside her, the words blurring in the fading light, forgotten for the moment in the face of the raw, untamed beauty that stretched before her.  She had come to Seawhisper seeking solitude, inspiration, and an escape from the clamour of London literary circles.  But the silence, once a welcome balm, was starting to feel a little too profound, the isolation a little too complete.
