The biting wind, straight off the Hudson, whipped at Captain Elias Thorne's turnout coat as he stared up at the brownstone.  Flames licked greedily at the fourth-floor windows, spitting out orange embers that danced like malevolent fireflies against the pre-dawn sky.  A low, guttural roar emanated from the building's belly, the sound of a beast feeding.  The air crackled with the electricity of burning wood and the urgent shouts of firefighters battling the blaze. Ladder 49, Elias’s company, had arrived just minutes ago, the first on the scene of what was quickly becoming a five-alarm inferno in the heart of Harlem.  The biting January air, already frigid, offered no respite from the radiating heat.  Sirens wailed in the distance, a mournful chorus heralding the arrival of more engines and more men to fight a battle that already felt perilously close to being lost.  The street, slick with ice and reflecting the flickering orange glow, was a chaotic ballet of hoses snaking across the pavement and firefighters moving with practiced urgency. Elias, his helmet shadowing his grim face, felt a knot tighten in his stomach.  This one felt… different.
