The insistent Vermont wind rattled the leaded glass windows of Dr. Albright’s Family Dentistry, whistling a mournful tune that seemed to echo the churning in Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s stomach.  Snow, thick and wet, piled against the brick facade of the building, blurring the view of the quaint, normally bustling town square of Maple Creek. It was a Thursday, typically one of Amelia’s busiest days, but the blizzard, which had started the previous evening, had kept all but the most determined (or desperate) patients away.  The silence in the usually chatter-filled office was unsettling, broken only by the rhythmic hiss of the autoclave and the occasional sigh of the ancient radiator struggling against the February chill. Amelia, clad in her pale blue scrubs, stared out the window, a faint sheen of anxiety glazing her normally bright green eyes. This was supposed to be a day of routine cleanings and fluoride treatments, a welcome respite from the more complex cases that often landed on her Fridays.  Instead, it felt like a scene from a gothic novel, with the isolating snow and the unnerving quiet amplifying a sense of foreboding that had been clinging to her since the first snowflakes began to fall.
