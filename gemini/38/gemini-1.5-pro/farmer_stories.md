The biting wind whipped across the frost-covered fields of Abernathy Farm, catching in the tangled brown beard of Jedediah Caleb Finch.  Jedediah, his calloused hands shoved deep in the pockets of his worn canvas coat, surveyed his land.  The November sun, a pale, watery disc in the gunmetal sky, offered little warmth.  Abernathy Farm wasn’t much – a hundred acres of rolling hills and stubborn soil nestled in the shadow of the brooding Black Ridge Mountains in western Virginia – but it was his.  Every furrowed acre, every weathered fence post, every bleating sheep in the distant pasture represented generations of Finch sweat and toil.  This year, though, something felt different.  The air hung heavy with an unnatural stillness, the kind that precedes a storm, and it wasn't the meteorological kind.  Jedediah couldn’t shake the feeling that something was watching him, something lurking just beyond the veil of the swirling mist that clung to the valley floor.
