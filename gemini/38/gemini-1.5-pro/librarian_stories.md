The frosted breath of November clawed at the leaded glass windows of the Briarwood Public Library, sketching ephemeral ferns and spirals across the panes. Inside, the air hummed with the low thrum of the ancient radiator and the faint, parchmenty scent of aging books.  Dust motes danced in the shafts of sunlight that pierced through the gaps in the heavy, velvet drapes.  Eleanor Vance, the head librarian, perched on a rolling ladder, her fingers tracing the spines of a particularly dusty collection of Victorian poetry. She wore a cardigan the colour of a robinâ€™s egg, a stark contrast to the muted browns and greys of the surrounding shelves.  Outside, the wind howled, rattling the skeletal branches of the ancient oak that stood sentinel over the library grounds, a harbinger of the coming winter and the secrets it held.
