The biting November wind whipped around Eleanor Vance, RN, as she hurried across the deserted parking lot of St. Jude's Community Hospital.  Fluorescent lights bled through the grimy windows of the ER, casting long, skeletal shadows of the bare branches scraping against the glass. The air smelled of wet asphalt and the faint, metallic tang of approaching snow. Eleanor pulled her threadbare wool coat tighter around herself, the damp chill seeping through to her bones despite the layers she wore underneath her scrubs.  Tonight, her shift had stretched hours past its scheduled end, a familiar symphony of overflowing waiting rooms and short-staffed floors.  The small town of Havenwood, nestled deep in the Appalachian Mountains of western North Carolina, was experiencing a particularly brutal flu season, and St. Jude's, the only hospital within a fifty-mile radius, was bearing the brunt of it.  As Eleanor reached the entrance, the automatic doors slid open with a groan, revealing the chaotic ballet of a typical Friday night in the ER, amplified tenfold by the relentless surge of sickness.
