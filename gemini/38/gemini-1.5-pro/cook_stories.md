The clatter of pots and pans was a familiar morning symphony for Elias Thorne.  He hummed along, a low, rumbling tune lost beneath the sizzle of bacon and the rhythmic chop of his cleaver against a wooden board.  Outside, the fog clung to the cobbled streets of Port Blossom, a small fishing town nestled between the jagged cliffs of the Whisperwind Coast and the churning, grey expanse of the North Sea.  The salty air, thick with the scent of brine and woodsmoke, seeped into Eliasâ€™s tiny kitchen, mingling with the aroma of frying onions and brewing coffee.  The Galley Grub, Elias's diner, was a snug, single-room affair, its walls adorned with faded fishing nets, hand-painted buoys, and a collection of mismatched plates, each bearing a story gleaned from a passing sailor or weathered fisherman.  Dawn was just breaking, painting the sky in hues of lavender and rose, promising a day of unpredictable weather, just like any other day in Port Blossom.
