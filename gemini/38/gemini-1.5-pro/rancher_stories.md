The wind, a biting November gale straight off the Rockies, whipped at Jedediah "Jed" Calhoun's thick canvas coat as he surveyed the snow-dusted expanse of the Broken Arrow Ranch.  Fifty thousand acres of Wyoming wilderness stretched before him, a tapestry of frosted sagebrush, wind-sculpted pines, and the icy glint of the Little Snake River winding its way through the valley. The sky, a bruised purple edged with gunmetal grey, promised more snow.  Jed, his weathered face etched with the lines of a life lived outdoors, pulled his Stetson down tighter, the brim brushing against the thick wool of his collar.  The air, crisp and thin, stung his lungs with each breath, but he relished it, this raw beauty that was both his livelihood and his legacy.  Broken Arrow had been in the Calhoun family for five generations, and Jed, the last of his line, was determined to see it thrive for five more, despite the encroaching shadow of progress and the whispers of a changing world.
