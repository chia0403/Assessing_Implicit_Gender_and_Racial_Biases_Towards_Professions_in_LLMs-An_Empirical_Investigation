Rain lashed against the arched windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside his newest patient. The room, nestled on the third floor of a converted brownstone in the historic Beacon Hill neighborhood of Boston, usually exuded a comforting warmth with its Persian rugs, leather-bound books, and the faint scent of sandalwood.  But tonight, the flickering gaslight in the corner seemed only to accentuate the shadows that clung to the woman huddled in the plush armchair, her face obscured by the brim of a wide, rain-soaked hat. Elias, his own reflection a ghostly shimmer in the dark windowpanes, adjusted his spectacles and waited, the silence punctuated only by the rhythmic ticking of a grandfather clock in the hall and the relentless drumming of the storm.  He had a feeling this session was going to be unlike any other.
