The clatter of a passing hansom cab echoed up the narrow alley, momentarily drowning out the rhythmic whir of Amelia Harlow's treadle sewing machine.  It was a blustery November afternoon in 1888, and the gas lamps in Whitechapel, London, already flickered against the encroaching gloom. Ameliaâ€™s workshop, tucked away behind a bustling flower market on Dorset Street, was small but brimming with life: bolts of vibrant silk and sturdy wool stacked high, half-finished gowns draped over dress forms, and the comforting scent of lavender sachets hanging in the air to ward off the ever-present London smog. A single window, grimy with soot but offering a sliver of the grey sky, illuminated the dust motes dancing in the air, each pirouette a tiny rebellion against the encroaching darkness.  Amelia, her auburn hair pinned back severely, hummed a melancholic tune as she stitched the intricate beadwork onto a deep emerald ballgown, her nimble fingers moving with practiced ease.  Outside, the cries of street vendors mingled with the rumble of cartwheels, creating a constant, low thrum that served as the soundtrack to Amelia's solitary existence.
