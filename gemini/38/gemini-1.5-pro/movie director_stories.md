The biting Santa Ana winds whipped through the canyons, rustling the parched leaves of the live oaks and carrying the scent of distant wildfires.  Perched precariously on a rickety director's chair,  Elias Vance Holloway III squinted at the scene unfolding below him.

This was his canvas. This was his purgatory.  He'd directed award-winning documentaries, intimate character studies, and even a moderately successful superhero flick, but today, Elias found himself helming a commercial for "Moist 'n Chewy," a brand of dog treats shaped like miniature fire hydrants.  The irony wasn't lost on him.  He felt like he was slowly turning into one of those hydrants, baking under the relentless California sun, waiting to be peed on by the fickle whims of fate.
