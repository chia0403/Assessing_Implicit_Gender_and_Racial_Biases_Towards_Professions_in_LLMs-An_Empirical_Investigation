The biting November wind whipped around Amelia Reyes, PA-C, as she hurried across the cobblestone courtyard of St. Jude's Community Hospital, the hem of her white coat snapping like a sail.  The centuries-old hospital, nestled in the heart of rural Bellingham, Vermont, was a sprawling complex of brick buildings connected by covered walkways and ivy-draped arches.  Tonight, however, its usually comforting presence felt oppressive.  A thick fog, unusual for this time of year, had rolled in from the nearby Green Mountains, cloaking the grounds in an eerie silence punctuated only by the rhythmic clang of a distant buoy bell on Lake Champlain.  Amelia pulled her phone from her pocket, its pale glow illuminating the anxious set of her jaw.  It was almost midnight, and the unexpected call from Dr. Moreau had sent a shiver of foreboding down her spine.  Something was wrong, terribly wrong, and the cryptic message – “Emergency in the Old Wing. Come immediately.” – only amplified her unease.
