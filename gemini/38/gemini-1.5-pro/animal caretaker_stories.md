The biting wind whipped Amelia "Mia" Ramirez's auburn braid across her face as she trudged through the ankle-deep snow towards the primate enclosure.  Dawn hadn't yet broken over the sprawling expanse of the Oakhaven Wildlife Sanctuary, nestled deep in the Adirondack Mountains of upstate New York. The only illumination came from the moon, hanging fat and low in the inky sky, and the string of fairy lights twinkling around the perimeter fence, a whimsical touch insisted upon by the sanctuary's eccentric founder.  The air, crisp and carrying the scent of pine and damp earth, stung Mia’s lungs, but the cold never bothered her.  She was used to it, having spent the last five years of her life braving the harsh winters to care for Oakhaven’s rescued residents. This morning, her primary concern was Koko, the sanctuary's elderly orangutan, who had developed a persistent cough and refused to leave her heated indoor enclosure for the past two days.
