The recycled air hummed a monotonous tune as Amelia "Mia" Rodriguez secured the cabin door of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Outside, the Miami International Airport buzzed with pre-dawn activity, a chaotic ballet of flashing lights and hurried ground crew. The air hung thick and heavy with the promise of a Florida summer sunrise, a humid blanket draped over the tarmac. Inside, the cabin was cool and dimly lit, the overhead bins yawning open like sleepy giants.  Mia, her crisp navy uniform a stark contrast to the plush passenger seats, adjusted the knot of her silk scarf, a small wave of pre-flight jitters rippling through her. This wasn't just any flight. It was the inaugural run of Sunshine Airways' new direct route to Santiago, Chile, and Mia, handpicked for her bilingualism and impeccable service record, was leading the cabin crew. The weight of expectation, both from the airline and from her own ambition, settled in her stomach, a mix of excitement and a healthy dose of nerves. This flight, she knew, could be the first step towards her dream of becoming a chief purser.
