The biting wind whipped across the desolate airfield, stinging Captain Amelia "Ace" Reyes's cheeks as she prepped her battered Cessna 182 Skyhawk for takeoff.  Dust devils danced across the cracked tarmac of Harmony Airfield, a forgotten speck in the vastness of the Nevada desert.  The only signs of civilization for miles were a rusted-out fuel pump, a dilapidated hangar that leaned precariously to one side, and the flickering neon sign above the equally dilapidated diner across the road, which proclaimed “Rosie’s – Best Coffee This Side of Nowhere.”  Amelia tightened the straps of her leather flying jacket, the rising sun painting the sky a bruised orange and purple. This wasn’t the glamorous life she'd envisioned as a fresh-faced graduate of the Air Force Academy, but it was her life, and the wide-open sky above promised something more than the dust and despair below. This morning, that promise came in the form of a crumpled telegram, and a job that was either crazy or incredibly important.  She glanced back at the telegram clutched in her gloved hand. It was simply addressed:  "Ace."
