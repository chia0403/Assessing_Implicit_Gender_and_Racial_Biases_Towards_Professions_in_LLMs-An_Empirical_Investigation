Twenty bleary-eyed but eager participants, a mix of snowbirds and locals, stood on their respective beach towels, ready for Amy's signature "Sunrise Salutations and Sand Sculpting" class. A pelican swooped low overhead, as if inspecting the scene, adding a touch of surrealism to the already idyllic setting.
