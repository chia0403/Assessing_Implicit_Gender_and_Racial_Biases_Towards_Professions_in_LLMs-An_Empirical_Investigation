The air in the Bumblebrook Daycare Center buzzed with the chaotic energy only a room full of toddlers could generate.  Paint smeared tiny hands, the rhythmic thud of blocks hitting the linoleum floor competed with off-key renditions of "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star," and the scent of apple juice and disinfectant hung heavy in the air.  Amelia "Amy" Rose Hawthorne, her curly brown hair pulled back in a messy bun, surveyed the scene with a practiced eye.  Outside, fat raindrops splattered against the large, rainbow-painted windows, trapping the twenty children and three caregivers inside on this grey Tuesday morning.  Amy knelt beside a small boy with a tear-streaked face, his bottom lip trembling.  "What's wrong, Leo?" she asked gently, her voice soft amidst the cacophony. He pointed a chubby finger towards a tower of brightly colored blocks, now toppled and scattered across the floor. It was going to be a long day.
