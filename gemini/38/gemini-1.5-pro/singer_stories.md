The flickering gaslight painted Esme Aurelia Blackwood’s dressing room in hues of sepia and ochre.  Outside, the November wind howled around the eaves of the Grand Majestic Theatre, rattling the windowpanes like skeletal fingers tapping for entry.  Built in the opulent style of the late 1800s, the theatre, with its plush velvet seats and ornate gold trim, felt both grand and decaying.  Tonight, the scent of damp wool from the audience mingled with the cloying sweetness of Esme’s gardenia perfume, a fragrance that had become her signature.  She sat at her vanity, its cracked mirror reflecting back a face framed by raven curls, her emerald eyes shadowed with a mixture of pre-performance nerves and a deeper, more persistent melancholy.  Tonight was the opening night of her comeback tour, a tour she hadn't wanted, a tour she felt compelled to do.  The chipped porcelain doll perched on the corner of the vanity seemed to mock her with its painted smile, a stark contrast to the trepidation that tightened Esme’s throat.
