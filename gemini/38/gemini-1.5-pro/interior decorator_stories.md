Rain lashed against the arched windows of Genevieve "Gen" Dubois's studio, a converted carriage house nestled behind a row of Victorian townhouses in the heart of Boston's Back Bay. The rhythmic drumming of water on the glass panes usually soothed Gen, a calming counterpoint to the vibrant chaos of fabrics, paint swatches, and furniture miniatures that filled her workspace. But today, the storm mirrored the tempest brewing inside her.  A half-finished mood board for a particularly demanding client – a tech millionaire with a penchant for chrome and a complete lack of taste – lay scattered across her drafting table, a testament to her creative block.  The scent of lavender from the diffuser she kept by her easel did little to dispel the rising tide of frustration. Outside, the twilight painted the wet cobblestones in hues of charcoal and steel, reflecting the glum mood that had settled over Gen like a heavy velvet drape.
