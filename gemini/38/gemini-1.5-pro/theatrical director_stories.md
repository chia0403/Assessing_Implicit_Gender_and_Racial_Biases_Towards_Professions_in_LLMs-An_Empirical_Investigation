The biting November wind whipped around the corner of Grimshaw Lane, tearing at the tattered posters advertising "The Tragedy of Macbeth" – Vivienne Holloway's latest, and most ambitious, production.  Rain, a relentless drizzle that promised to turn to sleet, plastered Vivienne’s dark hair to her forehead as she hurried toward the dilapidated brick building that housed the Grimshaw Playhouse. Its paint peeled like sunburnt skin, and one flickering neon sign stubbornly proclaimed "PLAYHO–SE."  Inside, Vivienne knew, chaos reigned.  Opening night was a mere week away, Macbeth’s soliloquies were being mangled by a lead actor grappling with laryngitis, the witches' cauldron prop had mysteriously gone missing, and the theatre's ancient heating system had chosen this precise moment to stage its own dramatic death.  Vivienne gripped the chipped brass doorknob, her breath misting in the cold air, a grim smile playing on her lips. This was her natural habitat.  This beautiful, crumbling chaos was where she thrived.
