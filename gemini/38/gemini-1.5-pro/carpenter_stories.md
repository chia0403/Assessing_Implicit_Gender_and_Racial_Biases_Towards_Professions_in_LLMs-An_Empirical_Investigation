The biting wind whipped off the Northumberland coast, carrying the scent of brine and sawdust into Elias Thorne's workshop.  Nestled between the craggy cliffs and the restless North Sea, the small village of Craster clung to the shoreline like a barnacle.  Its weathered stone cottages, huddled together against the elements, were a testament to generations of fishermen and their families who had braved the unforgiving ocean.  Elias, however, was a different breed.  While the rhythmic crash of waves against the shore was the soundtrack to most lives in Craster, the steady tap-tap-tap of his hammer and the rasp of his saw were the music that filled his days. His workshop, a converted bait shed perched precariously on the cliff edge, was a sanctuary of warm wood shavings and the comforting aroma of cedar and pine. Today, however, the usual peace was shattered by a frantic rapping at the door.
