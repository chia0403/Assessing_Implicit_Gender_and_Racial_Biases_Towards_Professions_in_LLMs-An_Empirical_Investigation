The rain hammered against the window of "Off the Beaten Track," obscuring the already fading November afternoon light in downtown Portland, Oregon. Inside, Elsie Magnolia Cartwright sighed, the rhythmic drumming a melancholic soundtrack to her day.  Her office, a cozy nook tucked between a boisterous brewpub and a perpetually empty yoga studio, usually vibrated with the energy of her meticulously planned itineraries and the dreams of her clients.  Today, however, the only tangible vibrations came from the rickety radiator wheezing in the corner.  A half-eaten veggie burger sat forlornly on her desk beside a stack of brochures for Icelandic glaciers, Tuscan vineyards, and Amazonian rainforest treks, none of which seemed to hold the slightest interest for anyone at the moment. Elsie suspected the dismal weather was partly to blame, but a deeper unease settled in her stomach.  It had been a slow week, a slow month, truthfully.  If things didn't pick up soon, Elsie feared her own off-the-beaten-track dreams might have to be indefinitely postponed.
