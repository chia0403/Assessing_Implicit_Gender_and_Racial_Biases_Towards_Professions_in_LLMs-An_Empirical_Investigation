The clatter of aluminum pots, the sizzle of garlic hitting hot oil, the rhythmic thud of a cleaver against a well-worn wooden block – these were the sounds that composed the morning symphony of  Eleanor "Ellie" Vance's life.  Her restaurant, "The Salt Cellar," nestled in the heart of the fog-draped, cobbled streets of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, was a haven from the bracing Atlantic winds.  Its walls, painted a warm, inviting ochre, held the tantalizing aroma of a thousand culinary experiments – from Ellie's signature lobster bisque, simmering on the back burner, to the subtly spiced apple crumble cooling on the window sill. This morning, however, the air held a tension thicker than the clam chowder Ellie was prepping for the lunch rush. A crisp letter, bearing the insignia of a prestigious culinary academy in Paris, lay unopened on the counter, its ivory edge a stark contrast to the well-worn wood.  Ellie, her chestnut braid coiled tightly at the nape of her neck, avoided its gaze, her focus resolutely fixed on the rhythmic chopping of celery.  This letter held the answer to a dream she’d held close for years, a dream that threatened to upend the comfortable rhythm she’d built for herself in this salty, seaside town.
