Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the precinct, mirroring the turmoil brewing inside Dr. Eleanor Vance Holloway. The flickering fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow across the cramped interview room.  Eleanor, her dark hair pulled back in a tight bun, meticulously arranged her recording equipment on the scarred metal table. The air hung thick with the stale scent of coffee and despair, a familiar aroma in the 19th precinct of the Lower East Side. Tonight's subject, a man accused of a particularly gruesome double homicide, awaited her in the adjacent holding cell.  Eleanor adjusted her glasses, the faint click of the frames a small counterpoint to the rhythmic drumming of the rain. This wasn't her first rodeo, but something about this case, the sheer brutality coupled with the suspect's unnerving calmness, had her on edge.  The detective’s words from earlier echoed in her mind: "Dr. Holloway, this one… he's different."
