The insistent London drizzle seemed to mirror the relentless thrum of Amelia "Amy" Thorne's headache.  It was a Tuesday, the kind that started with a lukewarm cup of tea and the realization that the printer ink was, yet again, magenta deficient.

The only splash of colour came from the neon pink sticky note plastered to her monitor: "Deadline: Midnight.  No excuses, Thorne."
