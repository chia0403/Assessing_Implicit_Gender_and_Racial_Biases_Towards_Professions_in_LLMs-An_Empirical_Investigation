The biting wind, scented with woodsmoke and the faint iron tang of blood, whipped around Elias Thorne as he hoisted a freshly slaughtered pig carcass onto the hook in his shop.

This was Elias's world, a world of sharp edges and quiet efficiency, a world where life and death met on the butcher's block every single day.  But today, something felt different.
