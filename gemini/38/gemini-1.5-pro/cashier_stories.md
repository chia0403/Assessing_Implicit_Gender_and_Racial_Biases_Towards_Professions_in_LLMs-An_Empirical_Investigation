The flickering fluorescent lights of the Quick Stop buzzed in a rhythm only they understood, a counterpoint to the relentless hum of the refrigerated aisles. It was 2:17 AM, the deadest part of the night, and Amelia “Amy” Rodriguez leaned heavily against the scratched linoleum counter, idly spinning a keychain adorned with a miniature plastic taco.  Outside, the rain hammered against the single window, blurring the neon glow of the “Open 24 Hours” sign into a hazy, otherworldly beacon. The Quick Stop, nestled between a bail bonds office and a perpetually closed laundromat on the outskirts of Harmony Creek, Nevada, was less a beacon of hope and more a last resort. Tonight, like most nights, it was just Amy and the ghosts of stale coffee and lukewarm hot dogs keeping each other company.
