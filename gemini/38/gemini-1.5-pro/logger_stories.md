The biting pre-dawn air, sharp with the scent of pine and impending snow, nipped at Elijah "Lige" Blackwood's exposed cheeks. Frost crunched under his heavy boots as he navigated the rutted track leading deeper into the whispering woods of the Cascade Mountains.  Above, a sliver of moon hung pale and thin, offering little comfort against the encroaching darkness. Lige’s breath plumed before him, a ghostly white against the dense shadows of towering Douglas firs and Western Hemlocks. He adjusted the thick wool cap pulled low over his ears and squinted at the faintest hint of grey light bleeding into the eastern sky. Another day, another tree.  This stretch of old-growth forest, nestled high in the remote Snoqualmie Valley of Washington State, had been Lige’s domain, his livelihood, and his prison for the last twenty years.  He knew every twist of the logging road, every creek bed, every stand of ancient timber as intimately as the lines on his own calloused hands.
