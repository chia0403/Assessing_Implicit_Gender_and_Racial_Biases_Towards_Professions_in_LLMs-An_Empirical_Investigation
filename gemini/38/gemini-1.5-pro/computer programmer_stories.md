Rain lashed against the panoramic window of Elias Thorne's apartment, blurring the Seattle skyline into a shimmering, impressionistic mess of grey and electric blue.  Thirty-two stories below, the emerald needles of the Space Needle poked through the swirling mist, a ghostly reminder of the future Elias had always envisioned â€“ one of sleek lines and technological marvels.  Inside, the apartment was a stark contrast to the tempestuous scene outside.  Clean, minimalist, and dominated by the soft glow of multiple monitors, it was a sanctuary built on binary code and the comforting hum of high-powered processors. Elias, still in his worn programming hoodie and three-day-old stubble, hunched over his keyboard, fingers flying across the keys with a practiced ease.  He was chasing a bug, a particularly elusive one that had been plaguing his sleep and sanity for the past week.  The air smelled faintly of stale coffee and the remnants of a hastily microwaved burrito. Tonight, the deadline was looming closer than the storm clouds outside, and Elias knew, with a sinking feeling in his stomach, that sleep was a luxury he couldn't afford.
