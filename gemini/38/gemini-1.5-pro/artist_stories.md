The salt spray kissed Elara Vivienne Holloway's face as she perched precariously on the cliff edge, sketchbook balanced on her knee.  Below her, the turquoise waters of the Aegean Sea crashed against the volcanic rock of Santorini, carving deeper into the dramatic caldera that dominated the island's landscape.  Whitewashed villages, clinging like limpets to the sheer cliffs, shimmered in the late afternoon sun, their blue-domed churches punctuating the stark landscape with vibrant splashes of color.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and wild thyme, vibrated with the cicadas' relentless chorus.  Elara, her fiery red hair escaping its loose braid and whipping around her face like flames, squinted, trying to capture the precise shade of rose that kissed the clouds as the sun began its slow descent towards the horizon.  This was her third attempt to capture the scene, and frustration was beginning to prickle beneath her skin.  Nothing, not even the most vibrant pigment in her travel kit, could truly replicate the raw, breathtaking beauty before her.
