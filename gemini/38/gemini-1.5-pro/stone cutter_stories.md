The biting wind whipped off the granite face of Mount Cinder, stinging Elias Thorne's cheeks as he surveyed his latest project.  The air, thin and cold at this altitude, carried the scent of pine and damp earth, a fragrance Elias had inhaled since boyhood.  His workshop, little more than a canvas lean-to clinging precariously to the mountainside, offered meager protection from the elements. Inside, amidst a chaotic jumble of chisels, mallets, and half-finished carvings, a flickering oil lamp cast dancing shadows on the rough-hewn walls.  Below, the valley spread out like a rumpled green carpet, the village of Oakhaven nestled amongst the foothills, its houses appearing no bigger than pebbles from this vantage point.  Elias, a man built of granite himself – broad-shouldered and weathered, with hands calloused from a lifetime of wrestling stone – adjusted the thick wool scarf around his neck and picked up his chisel, the setting sun painting the sky in hues of bruised purple and fiery orange. Today, he was carving a griffin, its wings outstretched in defiant majesty, destined for the lintel of Oakhaven’s new library.  But Elias wasn't just carving stone; he was carving a legacy. A legacy whispered in the wind, echoed in the valleys, and etched into the very heart of the mountain.
