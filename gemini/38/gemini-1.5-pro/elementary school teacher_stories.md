The late afternoon sun, filtered through the dusty Venetian blinds of Mrs. Eleanor Vance’s third-grade classroom, cast long stripes across the worn linoleum floor.  Chalk dust, the faint scent of Elmer’s glue, and the lingering ghost of peanut butter sandwiches hung in the air.  Room 3B at Maplewood Elementary, nestled in the heart of sleepy Ashworth Valley, Oregon, was usually a whirlwind of activity. But now, at 4:45 pm, only Eleanor remained, perched on the edge of a tiny chair amidst a sea of miniature desks.  Outside, the rhythmic squeak of the swing set and the distant shouts of children playing tag provided a melancholic soundtrack to her solitude.  A single, crumpled drawing of a rainbow-colored unicorn lay on her desk, its creator’s name – “For Mrs. Vance, by Lily” – scrawled in thick crayon across the bottom. It was a small token of appreciation, yet it weighed heavily in Eleanor’s hand. This particular Tuesday had been…challenging, to say the least.
