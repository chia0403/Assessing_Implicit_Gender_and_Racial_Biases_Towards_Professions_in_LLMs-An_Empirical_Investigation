The biting wind whipped across the desolate expanse of the Klondike Plateau, stinging Rosalind "Roz" Murphy's exposed cheeks despite the thick layer of petroleum jelly she'd slathered on.  The sun, a weak, watery orb hanging low in the perpetually grey sky, offered little warmth.  Roz, perched high in the cab of her D11 dozer, squinted through the swirling snow at the staked-out path ahead.  This was her third season up north on the Aurora Borealis pipeline project, and by far the harshest.  The temperature gauge inside the cab read -35 degrees Celsius, and that didn't factor in the windchill, which Roz figured added another painful twenty degrees. Below her, the frozen earth groaned and creaked, a sound that usually faded into the background noise of the massive machine, but today, it held a sharper, more ominous edge.  She tightened her grip on the controls, a knot of unease forming in her stomach. This was no ordinary cold snap.  Something felt different.
