The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne as he locked up his practice, Thorne Family Dentistry, tucked between a laundromat and a perpetually closed Italian restaurant in the sleepy town of Havenwood, Oregon.  Fallen leaves, the color of burnt umber and rusty orange, skittered across the cracked asphalt of the parking lot.  The neon "Open" sign buzzed faintly as Elias flipped the switch, plunging the waiting room into darkness, save for the ethereal glow of the streetlight filtering through the frosted glass depicting a cartoon molar winking conspiratorially.  Havenwood, nestled in the Willamette Valley, was known for its Pinot Noir vineyards and its unnerving quiet, a quiet Elias had both cherished and resented in the five years since he'd moved there.  Tonight, however, the silence felt particularly heavy, pregnant with a sense of foreboding that had nothing to do with the impending winter.
