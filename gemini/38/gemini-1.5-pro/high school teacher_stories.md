The fluorescent lights of Mr. Elias Thorne's classroom hummed a monotonous B-flat, a counterpoint to the restless shuffling of papers and the hushed whispers of his tenth-grade English class at Ashwood High.  Rain lashed against the large, grimy windows, mirroring the grey, oppressive mood settling over the small town of Hollow Creek, Oregon. October had arrived, cloaking the normally vibrant, evergreen landscape in a damp, chilling fog. Elias, his worn tweed jacket pulled tight against the persistent draft sneaking through the window frame, watched the students with a mixture of weariness and affection.  Hollow Creek wasn't exactly a hotbed of literary enthusiasm, and convincing a room full of teenagers that Shakespeare wasn't ancient torture was a daily battle he was slowly losing. This particular Monday, however, felt different. A strange tension hung in the air, thicker than the fog outside, a premonition of something unsettling about to unfold.
