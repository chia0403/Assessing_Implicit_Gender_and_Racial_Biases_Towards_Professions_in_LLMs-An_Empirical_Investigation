The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, rattling the frosted panes of Dr. Elias Thorne's surgery window.  Sleet hammered against the glass, mirroring the insistent throbbing in his temples.  Greyhaven, a small fishing village perched precariously on the cliffs of the Yorkshire coast, was shrouded in a perpetual twilight, the low-hanging clouds swallowing the weak November sun. Inside, the surgery was dimly lit, the only sounds the crackling of the coal fire in the grate and the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner.  Elias rubbed his tired eyes, the faint scent of antiseptic clinging to his skin like a second coat.  He hadn't slept properly in days, ever since the strange sickness began to spread through the village.
