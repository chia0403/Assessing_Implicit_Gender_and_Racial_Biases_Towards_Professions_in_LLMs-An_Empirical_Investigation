The flickering neon sign of the Lucky Dragon Chinese takeout cast an oily sheen across the rain-slicked asphalt.  Amelia "Amy" Reyes, her trench coat clinging to her like a second skin, shivered despite the muggy July night in Miami.  Palm trees swayed rhythmically in the humid breeze, their fronds rustling like whispered secrets.  Amy adjusted the strap of her messenger bag, the weight of case files a familiar burden. Inside, dog-eared photographs and handwritten testimonies documented the broken promises and fragile hopes of her clients â€“ a tapestry of petty thieves, drug offenders, and those caught in the undertow of circumstance.  Tonight, she was headed to the last address on her list, a dilapidated Art Deco building on the edge of Little Havana, praying that Miguel Alvarez, a repeat offender with a penchant for fast cars and bad decisions, was actually where he claimed to be. The air thrummed with a nervous energy, a premonition that hung heavy in the thick Miami air. This was just another Tuesday night for Amy Reyes, but something told her this one would be different.
