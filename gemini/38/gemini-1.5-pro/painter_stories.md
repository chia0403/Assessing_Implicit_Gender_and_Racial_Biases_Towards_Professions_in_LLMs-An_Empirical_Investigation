The salt-laced wind whipped Amelia Zephyr Thorne's auburn braid across her face, momentarily obscuring the view of the crumbling lighthouse she was attempting to capture on canvas.  Perched precariously on a windswept bluff overlooking the churning turquoise waters of the Celtic Sea, Amelia braced herself against a jagged outcropping of rock.  The Isle of Skye, in all its raw, untamed beauty, sprawled before her, a tapestry of heather-clad hills, dramatic cliffs, and hidden lochs.  Grey clouds scudded across a sky the colour of bruised plums, casting fleeting shadows that chased each other across the landscape.  The air was thick with the cries of gulls and the rhythmic crash of waves against the shore, a symphony that both soothed and invigorated Amelia's artistic soul.  This remote corner of Scotland, miles from the nearest village, was where she came to find inspiration, to lose herself in the wild embrace of nature, and to translate the untranslatable onto the blank canvas before her.
