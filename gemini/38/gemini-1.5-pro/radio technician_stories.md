The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, rattling the corrugated iron roof of the shed where Elias Thorne, his breath clouding the frigid air, meticulously soldered a connection on a vintage Marconi receiver. The shed, perched precariously on the cliff edge overlooking the churning grey expanse, served as both workshop and home for Elias.  Salt spray, a constant companion, coated everything in a fine, gritty film, including the jumble of wires, vacuum tubes, and antique radio equipment that crammed the space. The only light came from a bare bulb dangling from a rafter, casting long, dancing shadows that mimicked the restless waves below.
