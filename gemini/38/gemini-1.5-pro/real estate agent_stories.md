The crisp October air, scented with woodsmoke and decaying leaves, nipped at Juliana "Jules" Devereux's cheeks as she hurried across the cobblestone walkway. Her breath puffed out in white clouds, momentarily obscuring the wrought-iron gate of Eventide Manor. Nestled amidst the vibrant foliage of the Berkshire Mountains in western Massachusetts, the estate seemed to sigh under the weight of its history.

Jules adjusted the strap of her oversized leather bag, the weight of property brochures and a thermos of lukewarm coffee a familiar burden.  This listing, a sprawling Victorian relic rumored to be haunted, had been sitting stagnant on the market for over a year.  Jules, however, saw potential beneath the dust and the whispers. This wasn't just another house; it was her ticket to finally making a name for herself in the fiercely competitive Lenox real estate scene.
