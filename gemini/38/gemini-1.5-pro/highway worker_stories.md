The biting wind whipped across the desolate stretch of Highway 17, stinging Elias Vance's cheeks like a thousand tiny needles.  The late November sun, a watery disc low in the iron-grey sky, offered little warmth.  Around Elias, the skeletal branches of jack pines clawed at the steely expanse above, their mournful sighing the only sound besides the distant drone of a semi and the crunch of Elias's boots on the frost-covered gravel shoulder.  He pulled his orange safety vest tighter, the reflective stripes a beacon in the gathering gloom.  A discarded tire swing, its rope frayed and dangling, hung from one of the pines, a lonely sentinel overlooking the vast, snow-dusted plains of southern Saskatchewan. This was Elias’s domain – mile after mile of asphalt ribbon unspooling across the empty landscape, his responsibility to keep it clear, safe, and, in this weather, passable. Today's task was less glamorous than most: replacing the faded, bullet-riddled road signs warning of the upcoming sharp curve, a notorious spot for black ice and bewildered tourists.
