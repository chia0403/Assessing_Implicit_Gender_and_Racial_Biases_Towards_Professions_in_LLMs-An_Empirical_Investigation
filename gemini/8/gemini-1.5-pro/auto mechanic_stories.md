The rusty clang of a dropped wrench echoed through the cavernous garage, swallowed up by the perpetual twilight of stacked tires and looming engine hoists.  Grease stained the concrete floor like abstract art, reflecting the faint, flickering fluorescent lights overhead.  This wasn't just Amelia "Milly" Rodriguez's workplace, it was her sanctuary, a haven of whirring motors and the comforting scent of gasoline that had permeated her life since she was old enough to hold a socket wrench.  Rodriguez Auto Repair, nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed down bowling alley on the outskirts of Harmony Creek, Oregon, was more than just a business; it was a legacy, passed down from her grandfather, a Cuban immigrant who had poured his heart and soul into every bolt and piston that crossed his path.  Now, it was Milly's turn, and the weight of that responsibility settled on her shoulders like a well-worn mechanic's jumpsuit.  The early November air, crisp and carrying the scent of pine from the nearby forests, seeped through the gaps in the garage door, a reminder of the world outside, a world Milly rarely had time for.
