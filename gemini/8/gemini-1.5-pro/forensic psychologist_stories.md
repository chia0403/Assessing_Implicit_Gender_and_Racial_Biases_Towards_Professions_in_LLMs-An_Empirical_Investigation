The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Eleanor Vance, snagging at the edges of her charcoal grey coat and plastering stray strands of auburn hair across her face.  The sodium-vapor lamps of the Grimsby Police Department parking lot cast a sickly yellow glow on the scene before her: a cordoned-off area pulsating with flashing blue and red lights, the stark white of a forensics tent a jarring counterpoint to the grimy brick wall of the abandoned warehouse behind it.  Rain, mixed with sleet, began to fall, coating the asphalt in a treacherous sheen.  Eleanor tucked a loose strand behind her ear, a nervous habit, and adjusted her briefcase, the leather cold and stiff against her gloved hand. Detective Inspector Davies, a burly man with a face like granite, emerged from the swirling chaos and approached her, his breath clouding the frigid air. "Glad you could make it, Doctor," he said, his voice gravelly. "Weâ€™ve got a nasty one here."
