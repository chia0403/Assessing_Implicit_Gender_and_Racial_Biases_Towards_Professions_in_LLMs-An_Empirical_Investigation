The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of plumeria and exhaust fumes.  A gecko chirped from a crack in the crumbling ochre wall of the Palacio de los Capitanes Generales, seemingly oblivious to the cacophony of Havana’s bustling Plaza de Armas. Isabella “Izzy” Rodriguez smoothed down her crisp linen shirt, adjusting the microphone clipped to the collar.  She squinted against the fierce midday sun, her gaze sweeping over the cobblestones, worn smooth by centuries of foot traffic.  Her group, a motley crew of twelve American tourists, fanned themselves with brightly colored brochures, their faces a mixture of awe and bewilderment. Izzy, accustomed to the heat and the faded grandeur of her city, offered a welcoming smile. "Bienvenidos a La Habana Vieja," she announced, her voice clear and resonant, cutting through the background noise. "Welcome to Old Havana. A city frozen in time, yet pulsing with a life all its own."
