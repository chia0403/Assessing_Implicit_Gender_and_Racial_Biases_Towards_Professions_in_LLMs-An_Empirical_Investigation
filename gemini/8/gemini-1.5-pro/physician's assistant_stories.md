Rain lashed against the windows of the Cedarwood Clinic, mimicking the frantic rhythm hammering in Elias Thorne's chest.  The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sterile, cold glow over the waiting room, now eerily empty save for Elias and the receptionist, Mrs. Petrov, who was knitting a vibrant purple scarf with an almost unsettling calm.  Cedarwood, nestled deep in the Appalachian foothills of western North Carolina, was usually a haven of tranquility. Tonight, however, an unnerving tension hung in the air, thick and heavy like the fog swirling outside. Elias, a physician's assistant barely a year out of school, rubbed the sleep from his eyes, the lingering dregs of a snatched nap on the examination table doing little to alleviate the exhaustion clinging to him like the damp mountain air.  The clinic's single phone line, usually silent at this hour, had shrieked to life just an hour ago, shattering the uneasy peace and summoning Elias back to a reality that felt increasingly surreal.
