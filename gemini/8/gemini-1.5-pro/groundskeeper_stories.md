The biting November wind whipped across the manicured lawns of Eventide Manor, tugging at Elias Thorne's threadbare cap and sending crimson and gold leaves swirling around his worn work boots.  Elias, whose full name was Elias Peregrine Thorne, pulled his collar higher and surveyed his domain.  Eventide, a sprawling gothic mansion perched on a cliff overlooking the churning grey expanse of the North Sea, was his responsibility. Every blade of grass, every rose bush, every gnarled oak in its extensive gardens fell under his care. He knew the rhythms of this place like the back of his calloused hand â€“ the way the dawn mist clung to the rose arbour, the mournful cry of the gulls as they wheeled overhead, the creak of the ancient wisteria that clawed its way up the west wing.  Today, however, something felt different. A stillness hung in the air, heavier than the approaching storm clouds, and a prickle of unease settled at the base of Elias's spine. He couldn't quite place it, but the air hummed with a strange, unsettling energy.  It felt like Eventide was holding its breath.
