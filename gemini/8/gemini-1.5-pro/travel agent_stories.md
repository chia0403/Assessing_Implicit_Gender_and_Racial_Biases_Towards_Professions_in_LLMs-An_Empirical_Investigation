The relentless Glasgow rain hammered against the window of "A Wee Jaunt Away," blurring the neon script advertising last-minute deals to Tenerife.  Inside, Elsie May MacIntyre, hunched over a steaming mug of tea, stared at the flickering computer screen. The agency, tucked between a chippy and a perpetually closed laundromat on Byres Road, usually buzzed with the hopeful chatter of holidaymakers. This Tuesday morning, however, the only sound was the rhythmic drumming of the rain and Elsie May's occasional sigh. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow across the brochures promising sun-drenched beaches and azure skies â€“ a stark contrast to the grey reality outside.  Elsie May longed for escape, a yearning as persistent as the Scottish drizzle. Ironically, the purveyor of exotic getaways hadn't taken a proper holiday herself in five years.
