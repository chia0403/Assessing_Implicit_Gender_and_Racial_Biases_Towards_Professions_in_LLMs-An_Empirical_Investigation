The fluorescent lights of the Sterling-Cooper Building hummed a monotonous B-flat above Beatrice "Bea" Periwinkle, their dull glow reflecting in the polished mahogany of Mr. Henderson's desk.  It was a Tuesday in October, 1962, and a damp chill clung to the air conditioning like a forlorn lover. Outside, the grey canyons of Manhattan teemed with the usual lunchtime rush, the sounds muted to a low thrum behind the thick pane of glass. Bea, perched on the edge of her secretarial chair, tapped a crimson-tipped fingernail against her notepad, the rhythmic click a counterpoint to the relentless whir of the IBM Selectric typewriter in the corner.  Her crisp white blouse, starched to within an inch of its life, rustled softly with every precise movement.  Everything in Mr. Henderson’s office, from the meticulously arranged leather-bound volumes on the bookshelf to the gleaming silver pen and pencil set, spoke of order and control. Except, perhaps, for the overflowing ashtray beside the telephone, a swirling vortex of grey ash and burnt-out cigarette butts – a silent testament to the simmering tension that always preceded Mr. Henderson's important meetings. And today was particularly important.
