Static crackled from the speakers – the persistent Martian wind translated into radio noise – but underneath, faint and distorted, she could just make out the strains of a Vivaldi concerto, a ghostly echo from home.  Her mission was simple: keep the comms online. But on Mars, even simplicity was a fight against the elements, a constant battle against the unforgiving red dust and the gnawing loneliness.
