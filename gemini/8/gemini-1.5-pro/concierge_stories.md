Rain lashed against the Art Deco windows of the Grand Majestic Hotel, each drop a frantic drumbeat against the elegant silence within.  Inside, bathed in the warm glow of the lobby's crystal chandeliers,  Evangeline "Evie" Periwinkle, the hotel's head concierge, adjusted the silk scarf around her neck.  The Grand Majestic, perched on a cliff overlooking the churning grey expanse of the Atlantic Ocean just outside of the picturesque Irish village of Port Blossom, was a haven from the storm raging outside.  Tonight, however, Evie sensed a different kind of tempest brewing within its hallowed halls. A thick fog, mirroring the one clinging to the cliffs outside, seemed to have settled over the usual jovial atmosphere, replacing it with an unsettling stillness.  The only sound, apart from the relentless rain, was the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner, each tick a measured step towards an unknown event.
