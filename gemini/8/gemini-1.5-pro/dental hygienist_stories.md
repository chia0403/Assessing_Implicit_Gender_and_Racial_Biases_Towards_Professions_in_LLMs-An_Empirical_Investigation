The insistent Florida sun, already a brutal force at 8:00 am, glinted off the chrome hubcaps of the cars lining Palm Coast Parkway.  Inside the cool, sterile confines of "Smile Designers," Amelia Grace Holloway adjusted the overhead lamp, the faint whir a familiar hum in her ears. The pristine white of her uniform starkly contrasted with the vibrant turquoise walls of the office, a deliberate choice by Dr. Ramirez, who believed it evoked a sense of calm and tropical tranquility. Amelia, however, mostly found it clashing. Today, though, even the turquoise couldn’t distract her. A knot of unease tightened in her stomach, a feeling as persistent as the humidity clinging to the air.  It wasn't the usual Monday morning dread. It was something else, a prickle of anticipation mixed with a growing sense of foreboding.  She had a new patient today, a Mr. Silas Blackwood, and his file, unusually thin, lacked the standard insurance information.  He'd paid for the initial consultation in cash, a thick wad of bills, according to the receptionist.  And Amelia, despite her best efforts, couldn’t shake the feeling that something about Mr. Blackwood, and his unsettlingly perfect smile, was off.
