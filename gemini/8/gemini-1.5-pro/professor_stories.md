The biting November wind whipped around Professor Alistair Finchley, causing the edges of his tweed jacket to flap like agitated sparrows. He pulled his scarf tighter, the coarse wool scratching against his chin, and hurried across the cobbled quadrangle of St. Jude's College, Oxford.  Gargoyles leered down from the medieval stonework, their grimaces seemingly amplified by the swirling mist that clung to the ancient buildings.  The gas lamps, recently lit against the encroaching dusk, cast a flickering, ethereal glow over the scene, painting the damp stone in hues of orange and shadow.  Alistair was late, and the thought of facing the disapproving frown of the Dean, nestled amongst the other senior fellows in the Senior Common Room, spurred him onward.  He clutched a worn leather satchel overflowing with student essays, their weight a familiar burden.  Tonight, the aroma of pipe tobacco and sherry wouldn't be enough to mask the tension simmering beneath the surface of collegiate civility. Tonight, the future of the Archaeology Department, and indeed, Alistair's own future, hung precariously in the balance.
