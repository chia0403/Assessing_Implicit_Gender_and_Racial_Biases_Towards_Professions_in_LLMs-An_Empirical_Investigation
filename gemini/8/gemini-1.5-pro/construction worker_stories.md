The biting wind whipped at Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez's thick, dark braid as she surveyed the skeleton of the future skyscraper. Steel girders, like ribs of some metallic behemoth, clawed at the grey Manchester sky.  Fifty stories below, the city hummed, a dull roar swallowed by the wind and the clang of metal on metal.  It was 6:00 am, the sky barely blushing with the promise of dawn, but already sparks flew as welders began their day, tiny suns against the pre-dawn chill.  Amy, perched precariously on a steel beam, two hundred feet in the air, tightened her harness and adjusted her hard hat. This was her office, her domain.  The Shard, they were calling it. Another glass and steel monument to progress, piercing the heart of a city constantly reinventing itself. For Amy, it was just another job, another set of blueprints to bring to life, another dance with gravity. But something about the biting wind this morning, the way it howled through the skeletal frame, sent a shiver down her spine that had nothing to do with the cold.
