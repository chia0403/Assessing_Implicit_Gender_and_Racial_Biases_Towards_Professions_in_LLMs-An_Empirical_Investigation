Rain lashed against the mullioned windows of Amelia Thorne’s attic apartment, mimicking the staccato rhythm of her fingers tapping across the keyboard.  The ancient gargoyles perched on the Notre Dame Cathedral, barely visible through the downpour, seemed to leer disapprovingly at the flickering neon sign of the "Le Chat Noir" jazz club across the narrow Rue de la Huchette. Inside, a muffled saxophone solo warred with the storm’s fury. Amelia, a freelance editor with a penchant for vintage typewriters and strong black coffee, ignored both.  Her apartment, a charmingly chaotic blend of overflowing bookshelves, precariously stacked manuscripts, and the faint scent of old paper, was her sanctuary. Tonight, it was also her prison. A deadline loomed, the manuscript a particularly dense biography of a 17th-century French alchemist, and Amelia, fueled by caffeine and sheer stubbornness, was determined to conquer it.
