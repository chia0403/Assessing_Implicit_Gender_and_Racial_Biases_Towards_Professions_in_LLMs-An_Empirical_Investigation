The flickering gaslight painted the cobbled alleyway in a sickly yellow, its glow barely reaching the chipped brick wall where Elara Nightingale perched, humming a melancholic tune.  A single, crimson rose, tucked behind her ear, was the only splash of vibrant colour against the muted greys and browns of 1898 London.  Fog, thick as pea soup, swirled around her ankles, obscuring the refuse and rat-infested corners of Whitechapel. Elara, her breath misting in the cold November air, tightened the threadbare shawl around her shoulders.  The melody she hummed, a haunting ballad of lost love and betrayal, was one she’d written herself, and it echoed the hollowness that gnawed at her heart. Tonight, she wasn’t Elara Nightingale, the celebrated songbird of the Alhambra Music Hall. Tonight, she was just Elara, a ghost haunting the backstreets, searching for a truth that threatened to shatter the fragile illusion of her success.
