The biting wind whipped off the East River, carrying the greasy scent of frying onions from a nearby hot dog stand and the metallic tang of old snow. Detective Isabella “Izzy” Diaz, her dark hair plastered to her face by the icy rain, hunched deeper into her threadbare NYPD jacket, the collar pulled high.  Across the street, the gargoyles perched atop the gothic architecture of St. Augustine's Church seemed to leer at the scene unfolding below: a cordon of yellow tape flapping in the wind, two uniformed officers shivering beside a body bag, and the flashing blue and red lights painting grotesque shadows on the church’s stone façade. This was Alphabet City, East Village, Manhattan, and a cold Tuesday morning in March had just gotten a whole lot colder.
