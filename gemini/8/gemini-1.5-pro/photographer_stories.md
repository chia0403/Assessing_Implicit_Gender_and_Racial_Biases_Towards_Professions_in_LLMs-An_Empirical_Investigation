The salt spray kissed Amelia Reyes’s face, a familiar greeting on this windswept cliff overlooking the churning slate-grey waters of the North Atlantic.  The lighthouse at Land’s End, Cornwall, stood sentinel against the encroaching dusk, its beam a hesitant finger of light probing the gathering gloom. Amelia, perched precariously on a rocky outcrop, adjusted the tripod of her Hasselblad, her breath misting in the cold air.  The biting wind whipped strands of her dark hair across her face as she meticulously framed the shot – the crashing waves, the stark white tower against the darkening sky, a lone gannet circling overhead. This was the image she'd been chasing for weeks, the perfect blend of wild beauty and quiet solitude that captured the very essence of this remote corner of England.
