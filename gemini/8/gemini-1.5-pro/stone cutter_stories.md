The biting wind whipped off the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains, carrying with it the scent of pine and the faint, metallic tang of snowmelt. It clawed at Elias Thorne's thick wool cloak as he surveyed the cliff face, a sheer drop that plunged hundreds of feet into the mist-shrouded valley below.  His weathered hands, calloused and scarred from years of working granite and obsidian, gripped the worn leather handle of his hammer. The setting sun cast long shadows across the quarry, painting the grey stone in hues of violet and deep crimson. Here, nestled precariously on a narrow ledge, Elias carved his life from the unforgiving mountain, one painstaking swing of the hammer at a time.  His workshop, little more than a canvas tarp stretched over a wooden frame, clung to the rock face like a tenacious spider. Inside, amidst a clutter of chisels, mallets, and half-finished sculptures, a small fire crackled merrily, offering a fleeting respite from the encroaching cold.
