The salt-laced wind whipped Aurelia Celeste Moreau's hair across her face, tasting of brine and distant storms.  She tucked a stray auburn curl behind her ear, her fingers smudged with Prussian blue.  Perched precariously on a crumbling stone wall overlooking the churning Atlantic, Aurelia adjusted the easel, its wooden legs digging into the sparse, wind-battered grass.  Below, the fishing village of Port Blossom, Maine, clung to the rocky coastline like a barnacle to a ship's hull.  Its brightly painted houses, a riot of blues, greens, and reds against the grey backdrop of the sea, were Aureliaâ€™s current obsession, her canvas already alive with their vibrant, miniature forms. The late October air held a chill that promised snow, but Aurelia, lost in the interplay of light and shadow on the weathered shingles, barely noticed.  This rugged coast, a place of stark beauty and unpredictable moods, was both her muse and her sanctuary.
