Sunlight, filtered through those same leaves, cast dappled patterns across the worn, alphabet rug in the reading corner.  In the crisp air of a late September morning in the small town of Harmony Creek, Oregon, the faint scent of woodsmoke mingled with the ever-present aroma of crayon wax and Elmer's glue.  Mrs. Vance, a woman whose gentle smile crinkled the corners of her eyes like well-loved pages of a storybook, surveyed the room with a mixture of fondness and anticipation.
