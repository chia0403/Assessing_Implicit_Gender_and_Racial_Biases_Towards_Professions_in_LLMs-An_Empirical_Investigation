The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of The Rusty Mug, a rhythm as familiar to Elias Thorne as his own heartbeat.  Neon signs advertising long-defunct breweries flickered intermittently through the grime-streaked windows, casting an eerie, pulsating glow across the almost empty bar.  It was a Tuesday night in Port Blossom, Oregon, a town where the fog rolled in thicker than the tourists, and the only things booming were the crashing waves against the cliffs and Elias's business in the summertime.  Tonight, however, only two patrons huddled at the far end of the bar, their voices low murmurs against the relentless drumming of the rain.  Elias, his sleeves rolled up to his elbows, polished glasses with a practiced hand, the clinking a lonely counterpoint to the storm raging outside. The air hung thick with the scent of stale beer, damp wool, and the faint, lingering aroma of the fish and chips Mrs. O'Malley had cooked up earlier.  A single bulb above the bar cast a yellowish light on Elias's dark hair, streaked with premature grey at the temples, and the deep lines etched around his kind, but weary, eyes. He sighed, the sound swallowed by the storm, and glanced at the clock ticking slowly towards closing time.
