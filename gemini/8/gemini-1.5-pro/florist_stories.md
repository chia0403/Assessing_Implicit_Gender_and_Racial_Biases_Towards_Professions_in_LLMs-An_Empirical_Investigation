The bell above the door of "Petal & Stem" jingled merrily, a counterpoint to the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of Eliza Jane Worthington’s shears.  Outside, the cobbled streets of Port Blossom, Maine, shimmered under a July sun, the salty air thick with the scent of brine and blooming hydrangeas. Inside, the air was cooler, perfumed with the heady fragrance of lilies, roses, and the earthy, comforting aroma of damp soil.  Eliza, her auburn hair pulled back in a practical braid, surveyed her latest creation – a cascading bouquet of white orchids and pale pink sweet peas – with a critical eye.  This was for Mrs. Agatha Higgins' 80th birthday, and Agatha, as the town’s longest-standing resident and most discerning customer, expected nothing short of perfection.
