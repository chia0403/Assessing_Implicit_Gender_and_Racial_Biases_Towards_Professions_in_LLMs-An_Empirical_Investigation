The rain lashed against the mullioned windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her newest patient.  Her consulting room, nestled on the second floor of a converted Victorian townhouse in the historic Beacon Hill neighborhood of Boston, usually exuded a calming atmosphere.  The walls were painted a soft dove gray, accented by framed botanical prints and the warm glow of a Tiffany lamp perched on a mahogany side table.  A plush, emerald green sofa and two matching armchairs invited confidence and relaxation.  But tonight, even the crackling fire in the hearth couldn't quite dispel the chilling tension that hung in the air.  Eleanor, her dark auburn hair pulled back in a loose knot, observed the man seated across from her with a thoughtful frown.  He was hunched forward, his hands clasped tightly together, his knuckles white against the dark wool of his overcoat.  He hadn't spoken a word since arriving, the silence punctuated only by the rhythmic drumming of the rain and the occasional sigh that escaped his lips.  Something about him, about the palpable weight of his unspoken words, told Eleanor that this case would be unlike any she'd encountered before.
