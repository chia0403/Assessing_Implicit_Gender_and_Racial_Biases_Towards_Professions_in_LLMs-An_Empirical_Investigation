The relentless Nevada sun beat down on the dusty asphalt of Harmony Springs, baking the air to a shimmering haze.  Inside Harmony Springs Pharmacy, the only respite from the oppressive heat came from the whirring of the ancient ceiling fan and the hum of the refrigerated medication locker.  Eleanor Vance, PharmD, leaned against the cool metal of the locker, absently tracing the outline of a faded prescription label with her finger.  Harmony Springs, population 384 (not counting the occasional rattlesnake), wasn’t exactly a bustling metropolis, and Tuesdays were usually even slower than the tumbleweeds that rolled down Main Street.  This Tuesday, however, felt different. A prickle of unease ran down Eleanor's spine, a sensation she usually attributed to the impending arrival of a particularly demanding customer, or perhaps the town’s notorious gossip, Mildred McMillan, bearing tales of perceived slights and requesting her usual "nerve tonic." But this feeling was different, heavier.  It clung to the air like the dust motes dancing in the single shaft of sunlight that pierced the gloom of the pharmacy.
