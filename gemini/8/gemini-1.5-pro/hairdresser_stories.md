The rusty bell above the door of "Shear Perfection" jingled merrily, announcing the arrival of Mrs. Higgins, perpetually clad in lilac and smelling faintly of mothballs.  Elara Rosalind Thorne, her auburn braid coiled like a sleeping serpent atop her head, sighed inwardly.  It was another sweltering Tuesday afternoon in Harmony Creek, Georgia, a town where gossip spread faster than kudzu and sweet tea flowed like the Mississippi.  The air hung thick and heavy, promising thunderstorms later, a fact reflected in the frizz haloing Mrs. Higgins' perm.  Elara plastered a smile on her face, her emerald green eyes sparkling with practiced warmth. "Afternoon, Mrs. Higgins! What can I do for you today?"  She gestured towards the worn, but comfortable, salon chair, its vinyl a faded shade of avocado green. Harmony Creek might be small, but Elara poured her heart and soul into her little haven, a splash of vibrant color and life in the otherwise sleepy town square.  Today, however, she had a feeling this wouldn't be a typical Tuesday appointment.
