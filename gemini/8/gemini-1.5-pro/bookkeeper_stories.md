The rhythmic clatter of the old Underwood typewriter punctuated the stillness of the Silas Higgins Bookkeeping office, a small, cluttered space tucked between a laundromat and a perpetually closed fortune teller's parlor on Sycamore Street.  Dust motes danced in the weak afternoon sun filtering through the grimy windowpane, illuminating stacks of ledgers, overflowing file cabinets, and the hunched figure of Beatrice Amelia Peterson. Bea, as she preferred, tapped a stray lock of auburn hair back behind her ear with an ink-stained finger, her brow furrowed in concentration as she meticulously entered figures into the ledger for the Sycamore Street Butchers' Association.  The air in the small office was thick with the scent of aged paper, pencil shavings, and the faint, lingering aroma of Mrs. Higgins’ lavender hand soap – a ghostly reminder of the former owner who had passed away the previous spring, leaving Bea, her sole employee of ten years, to inherit the business and its eccentric clientele.  Outside, the humid July air hung heavy over the sleepy town of Havenwood, promising a thunderstorm later that evening.  But inside, in her small, ordered world of debits and credits, Bea felt a sense of calm, a comforting predictability that she clung to like a life raft in a turbulent sea.
