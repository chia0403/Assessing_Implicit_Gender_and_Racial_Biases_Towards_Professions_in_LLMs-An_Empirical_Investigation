The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Mug" cast a lurid, magenta glow across Amelia Reyes's tired face. Rain lashed against the window of the tiny diner, blurring the already distorted reflection of the 24-hour copy shop across the street where she'd spent the last twelve hours wrestling with a particularly demanding client's logo redesign.  It was 3:17 AM in the damp, gritty heart of downtown Philadelphia, a city that usually pulsed with a restless energy Amelia found invigorating, but tonight, it felt like a concrete cage pressing in on her. The chipped Formica tabletop, sticky with spilled coffee and forgotten dreams, mirrored the state of her own frayed nerves. Amelia, clutching a lukewarm mug that read "World's Okayest Designer,"  stared out at the desolate street, the rain a melancholic soundtrack to her mounting despair. This logo, a stylized phoenix meant to represent the client's "rebranding," was proving to be more of a turkey.  And if she didn't crack it soon, she'd be the one going up in flames.
