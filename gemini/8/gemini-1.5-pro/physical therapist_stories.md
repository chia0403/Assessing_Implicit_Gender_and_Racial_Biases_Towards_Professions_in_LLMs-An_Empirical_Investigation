The fluorescent lights of the Cedarwood Rehabilitation Clinic hummed a monotonous tune, punctuated by the rhythmic squeak of Dr. Eleanor Vance’s sensible shoes against the polished linoleum floor.  The scent of antiseptic mingled with the faint, metallic tang of winter clinging to the boots of patients trudging in from the snow-dusted parking lot. Outside, the January wind howled a mournful lament against the bare branches of the sycamore trees lining Route 44, their skeletal silhouettes stark against the bruised twilight sky of rural Vermont.  Eleanor adjusted the collar of her crisp white coat, a faint frown creasing the corners of her mouth.  This was her fourth year at Cedarwood, and while she’d grown accustomed to the long hours and the often heartbreaking stories that unfolded within these walls, the isolation of this small town was beginning to wear on her.  This evening, however, held a new kind of unease.  A new patient was scheduled to arrive - a high-profile case shrouded in an unusual amount of secrecy, and Eleanor had a distinct feeling that this arrival would disrupt the quiet rhythm of her life in ways she couldn’t yet imagine.
