The fluorescent lights of Northwood High hummed a monotonous B flat, a soundtrack to Ms. Eleanor Vance's Tuesday morning. Rain lashed against the window of her office, blurring the view of the sodden football field beyond.  Each droplet seemed to mirror the weight pressing on Eleanor's chest.  It wasn't the weather, not entirely. It was the feeling, the oppressive premonition that clung to the air like the scent of stale coffee and teenage angst. Northwood, nestled in the heart of the Oregon wilderness, was usually a haven of towering pines and crisp, clean air.  But today, something feltâ€¦ off.  The silence in the hallways was too thick, the absence of the usual boisterous chatter unsettling.  Even the perpetually cheerful secretary, Mrs. Peterson, had greeted Eleanor with a strained smile and whispered apologies about the broken coffee machine.  It was a Tuesday that felt like a Monday, only worse.
