The biting wind whipped down Chestnut Street, rattling the frosted panes of Madame Evangeline Moreau's atelier. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of beeswax, steaming tea, and the faint, sweet perfume of dying violets.  Sunlight, pale and watery as diluted wine, filtered through the large bay window, illuminating the chaotic beauty within.  Mannequins, draped in half-finished gowns of silk and lace, stood like ghostly sentinels.  Swatches of fabric in every imaginable colour and texture spilled from overflowing baskets, and pins, needles, and spools of thread littered every surface. Evangeline, perched on a low stool, her silver thimble gleaming in the weak light, meticulously stitched a row of pearl beads onto the bodice of a wedding gown.  Beyond the warmth of her small coal stove, the cobbled streets of 1888 Paris lay shrouded in a December chill.
