The rain hammered against the leaded glass windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's office, mimicking the relentless drumming in his own chest.  His consulting room, nestled on the second floor of a converted Victorian house in the sleepy, seaside town of Port Blossom, Maine, usually exuded an air of calm. The walls were painted a gentle seafoam green, bookshelves overflowed with well-worn volumes on human behavior, and a plush, teal-colored armchair sat invitingly across from his own.  But tonight, the storm raging outside seemed to seep into the very foundations of the house, mirroring the tempest brewing within Elias himself.  He stared out at the churning grey expanse of the Atlantic, the rhythmic sweep of the lighthouse beam momentarily illuminating the white-capped waves, and wondered if the approaching hurricane was an omen. He had a feeling the next few days were going to be anything but calm.
