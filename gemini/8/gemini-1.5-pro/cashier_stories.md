The flickering fluorescent lights of the Quick Stop buzzed in a dissonant hum with the perpetually whirring slushie machine.  Amelia Reyes, her name tag slightly askew on her faded blue polo shirt, sighed and leaned against the counter.  Outside, the Nevada sun beat down on the cracked asphalt of the parking lot, baking the air thick and heavy. Dust devils danced across the deserted expanse, occasionally swirling around the lone gas pump, its digital price display blinking $4.99 a gallon.  Inside, the only sound other than the mechanical chorus was the gentle clinking of Amelia sorting pennies in the cash drawer. It was a Tuesday afternoon in Harmony Springs, a town so small its only claim to fame was being halfway between two slightly larger, equally unremarkable towns.  Amelia, having graduated high school two years prior with no prospects beyond the Quick Stop, felt as stuck and stagnant as the lukewarm, half-melted cherry slushie swirling in the machine.  This, she thought with a pang of despair, was her life now.
