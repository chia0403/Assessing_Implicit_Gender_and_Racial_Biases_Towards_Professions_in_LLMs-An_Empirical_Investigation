The scent of old paper and beeswax hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma that Eleanor Vance, head librarian of the Whisperwood Public Library, had come to associate with sanctuary.  Whisperwood itself was a sleepy, fog-kissed town nestled deep in the Redwood National Park, where the ancient trees loomed like silent guardians, their branches filtering the sunlight into ethereal beams.  The library, a quaint Victorian building with gabled roofs and stained-glass windows depicting scenes from classic literature, stood as a beacon of knowledge amidst the natural grandeur. It was a Tuesday afternoon in late October, the kind where the air held a crisp bite and the leaves rustled with the promise of approaching winter. Rain pattered softly against the diamond-paned windows, a gentle rhythm accompanying Eleanor as she shelved a returned copy of "Moby Dick."  The library was unusually quiet, even for a Tuesday.  The only other occupant was old Mr. Henderson dozing peacefully in his usual armchair by the fireplace, a half-finished crossword puzzle resting on his lap.  This tranquility, however, was about to be shattered.
