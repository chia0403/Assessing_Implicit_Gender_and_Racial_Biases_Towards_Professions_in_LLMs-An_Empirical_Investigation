The siren’s wail sliced through the thick, humid air of a New Orleans night, reflecting off the wrought-iron balconies and echoing down the narrow streets of the French Quarter. Rain hammered against the windshield of Medic One, blurring the already hazy glow of neon signs advertising voodoo shops and beignets. Inside, paramedic Evangeline “Evie” Dubois gripped the dashboard, her knuckles white against her dark skin. The radio crackled with the dispatcher’s frantic voice: “Multiple casualties reported at the corner of Bourbon and Royal. Possible gas explosion. Medic One, expedite.” Evie exchanged a grim look with her partner, a rookie named Javier Rodriguez, his eyes wide with a mixture of fear and adrenaline. The humid air hung heavy in the ambulance, thick with the smell of antiseptic and the premonition of disaster.  As they rounded the corner onto Bourbon Street, the scene that unfolded before them was nothing short of chaotic.
