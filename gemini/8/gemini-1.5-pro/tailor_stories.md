The rhythmic clack of the treadle sewing machine echoed through the cramped, yet meticulously organized workshop. Dust motes danced in the single ray of sunlight that stubbornly pierced the grimy windowpane, illuminating Elias Thorne's nimble fingers as they guided a length of emerald green silk across the feed dogs. Elias, a man of forty-odd years with a perpetually stooped posture and kind, crinkled eyes the same shade as the fabric he worked, hummed a melancholic tune only he knew the words to. His shop, "Thorne's Threads & Trims," nestled between a boisterous butcher's and a perpetually dusty second-hand bookstore in the cobbled backstreets of Lower Grimsby, a port town perpetually shrouded in a salty mist that clung to everything like a second skin. The air, thick with the commingled scents of brine, coal smoke, and the faint sweetness of Eliasâ€™s beeswax polish, hinted at the secrets and stories woven into the very fabric of the town.  Today, however, a different scent, sharp and metallic, cut through the familiar aroma, bringing with it a premonition that would unravel the quiet routine of Elias Thorne's life.
