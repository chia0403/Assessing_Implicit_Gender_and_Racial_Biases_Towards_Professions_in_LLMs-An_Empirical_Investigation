The fluorescent lights of Mr. Theodore Finch’s classroom hummed a monotonous B-flat, a counterpoint to the restless shuffling and hushed whispers of his tenth-grade English class.  Rain lashed against the tall, arched windows of St. Jude’s Preparatory School, a venerable institution nestled amidst the rolling hills of the Hudson Valley.  October had arrived, painting the landscape in vibrant hues of crimson and gold, but inside Room 3B, the atmosphere was distinctly grey. Theodore, a lanky man with perpetually rumpled tweed jackets and a shock of unruly brown hair, tapped his pen against the worn copy of *The Great Gatsby* lying open on his desk.  He felt the familiar pre-lesson flutter in his stomach, a mixture of anticipation and dread that hadn't dissipated in his fifteen years of teaching.  Today, however, the dread was winning.  There was a distinct chill in the air, beyond the autumnal dip in temperature, and it seemed to emanate not from the storm raging outside, but from something within the very walls of St. Jude’s.
