The clatter of tin pans echoed through the cramped galley kitchen of the *Wanderlust*, a tramp freighter chugging its way across the storm-tossed Tasman Sea.  Rain lashed against the porthole, blurring the already grey view of churning water. The air hung thick with the competing scents of frying onions, diesel fumes, and the faint, metallic tang of approaching seasickness.  Elias Thorne, a man whose girth rivaled the ship's boiler, wiped a sheen of sweat from his brow with a stained dish towel. He hummed a jaunty sea shanty as he expertly flipped a mountain of potatoes in a well-worn cast iron skillet, his movements a practiced ballet of controlled chaos in the swaying galley. Outside, the wind howled, a mournful cry against the relentless waves.  Elias, however, was unfazed.  He had weathered worse storms than this, both at sea and in the kitchens of some of the most notorious ports in the southern hemisphere.  This was just another Tuesday.
