The rusty tang of rain hung heavy in the air, clinging to the slate roofs of Victorian houses like a damp shroud.  A chill wind, straight off the North Sea, whipped around Elias Thorne as he perched precariously on the chimney stack of Mrs. Albright's three-story terraced house, the red brick gritty beneath his calloused fingertips. Below him, the cobbled streets of Whitby, Yorkshire, stretched out like a grey and brown tapestry, punctuated by the occasional flash of a brightly coloured fisherman's jumper.  The fishing boats bobbed restlessly in the harbour, their masts clanging a mournful rhythm against the backdrop of the churning sea. Elias, secured by a worn leather harness, adjusted his safety goggles and squinted at the cracked mortar, the wind tugging at the edges of his faded blue beanie.  This was the fifth chimney he'd scaled that day, and the damp chill had seeped deep into his bones. He just hoped Mrs. Albrightâ€™s notorious cat, Mr. Whiskers, wouldn't decide to make an appearance today. Their last encounter had involved a near-fatal slip and a scratched face that had taken weeks to heal.
