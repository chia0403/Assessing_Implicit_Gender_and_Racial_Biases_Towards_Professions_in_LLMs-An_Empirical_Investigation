The rusty clang of the meat hook echoed in the pre-dawn chill of the butcher shop. Elias Thorne, his thick fingers already slick with the day's first blood, hummed a mournful tune as he hoisted a side of pork onto the gambrel.  Fat, pearly white and streaked with crimson, glistened under the single bare bulb hanging from the low ceiling.  Thorne's Butcher Shop and Fine Meats occupied a sliver of a storefront on Grimshaw Lane, nestled between a perpetually closed antique store and Mrs. Hathaway's overflowing haberdashery. Grimshaw Lane itself was a forgotten artery in the heart of Port Blossom, Maine, a town whose salty air hung heavy with the ghosts of its shipbuilding past and the whispered secrets of its inhabitants.  The rhythmic thud of Elias's cleaver against the worn wooden block was the only sound for blocks, save for the distant cry of a gull and the gentle lapping of the tide against the crumbling docks. The shop, with its sawdust-covered floor and the faint, metallic tang of blood in the air, felt like a world apart, a place where time moved slower, governed by the primal rhythm of flesh and bone.
