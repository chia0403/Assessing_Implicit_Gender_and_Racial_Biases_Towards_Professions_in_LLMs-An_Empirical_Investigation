The salt spray kissed Dr. Elias Thorne's face as he squinted at the ramshackle ferry pulling into the harbor.  Port Blossom, Maine, population 384 (not counting the seagulls), shimmered under a weak October sun.  Fishing boats bobbed gently against the weathered docks, their colorful hulls a stark contrast to the grey, shingle-sided buildings huddled along the waterfront.  Elias pulled his worn leather satchel closer, the faint metallic scent of dental instruments mingling with the sharp tang of the sea.  He hadn't planned on practicing dentistry in a place that felt more like the edge of the world than a functioning town, but Port Blossom, in its peculiar, isolated way, needed him. And, perhaps, he needed it too.
