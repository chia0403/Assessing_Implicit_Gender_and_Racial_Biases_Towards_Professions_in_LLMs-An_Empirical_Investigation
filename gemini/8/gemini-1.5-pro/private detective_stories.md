Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the Pink Flamingo Detective Agency, a rhythmic drumming that matched the dull ache in Delilah "Del" Jones's temples.  Neon light from the pawn shop across the street flickered through the grimy window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the stale air.  Her office, nestled between a laundromat perpetually exhaling the scent of hot detergent and a bail bondsman's with barred windows, was a small, claustrophobic box in the heart of Phoenix, Arizona.  The air conditioner, a wheezing relic from a bygone era, battled valiantly against the desert heat, losing the fight with a pathetic gurgle.  Del, perched precariously on a rolling chair that squeaked with every movement, tapped a chipped crimson nail against a mahogany desk scarred with cigarette burns â€“ relics of a previous tenant, she hoped.  The only other illumination came from a gooseneck lamp, its weak bulb casting a yellowish glow over a half-eaten container of lo mein and a stack of unpaid bills. It was 7:47 pm on a Tuesday, and the phone, stubbornly silent for days, finally shrieked to life, shattering the humid stillness.
