The air hung thick and heavy with the aroma of frying onions and sizzling bacon grease, a smell Amelia “Amy” Rodriguez had grown accustomed to, though never quite fond of.  The fluorescent lights of the Galaxy Diner buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow over the worn red vinyl booths and checkered tile floor.  It was 6:30 am on a Tuesday, the kind of morning that felt like it should still be night, and Amy, already two hours into her shift, was pouring coffee for a lone trucker nursing a plate of scrambled eggs and home fries. Outside, the pre-dawn sky over the dusty Nevada town of Harmony Springs was just beginning to lighten, revealing the jagged silhouettes of the distant McCullough Range. The diner, situated just off the lonely stretch of Highway 93, was the only sign of life for miles.  Amy, clad in her star-spangled uniform – a requirement she secretly found endearingly kitsch – sighed and wiped a stray strand of dark hair from her forehead.  Another day, another dollar.  She just hoped this one wouldn't involve another broken coffee pot or a run-in with Hank, the self-proclaimed mayor of Harmony Springs, who always seemed to find something to complain about, even if it was the perfectly good placement of the salt shaker.
