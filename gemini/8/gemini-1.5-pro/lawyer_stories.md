Her office, perched on the 27th floor of the Zenith Tower, normally offered a breathtaking panorama of the Chicago skyline, but tonight the city lights were swallowed by the swirling grey mist.  A half-empty mug of lukewarm Earl Grey tea sat forgotten on her desk, next to a framed photograph of her late grandfather, a renowned judge who had instilled in her a fierce passion for justice.  The incessant ringing of her phone cut through the rhythmic drumming of the rain.  It was a call she had been dreading.
