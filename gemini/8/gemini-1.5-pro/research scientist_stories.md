The biting Antarctic wind whipped at Dr. Aris Thorne's parka, stinging his exposed cheeks despite the layers of thermal protection.  He adjusted his goggles, the world sharpening back into a landscape of blinding white punctuated by the jagged, blue-grey peaks of the Ellsworth Mountains.  The Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, a cluster of low-slung buildings resembling oversized shipping containers, was a distant smudge on the horizon, a beacon of relative warmth and human contact in this desolate expanse.  Aris, bundled in his extreme weather gear, felt acutely aware of his isolation.  He was five kilometers from the station, alone except for the whirring of the specialized drill boring into the ancient ice beneath his feet, a sound that echoed strangely in the vast, frozen silence.  He was here, at the bottom of the world, to retrieve samples from a depth of two kilometers, ice that had last seen the sun over a million years ago, ice that held secrets he hoped would unlock the mysteries of Earth's past â€“ and potentially, its future.
