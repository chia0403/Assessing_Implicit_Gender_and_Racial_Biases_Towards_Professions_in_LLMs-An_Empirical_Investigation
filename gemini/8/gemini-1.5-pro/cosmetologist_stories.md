The flickering neon sign of "Shear Radiance Salon" cast a lavender glow across the rain-slicked asphalt of Sycamore Street. Inside, amidst the hum of hair dryers and the sharp scent of perm solution, Elara Vivienne Holloway meticulously applied a vibrant teal dye to Mrs. Henderson's wiry curls.  Elara, a whirlwind of controlled energy in her black apron and studded platform sandals, loved the controlled chaos of Friday afternoons at the salon.  Sycamore Street, nestled in the heart of the quirky, artsy town of Harmony Glade, Oregon, was usually a haven of tranquility, but Fridays held a distinct buzz, a collective exhale as the town geared up for the weekend's festivities. This Friday, however, held a different kind of tension, a palpable electric hum that vibrated beneath the rhythmic snip of Elara's scissors, a premonition that something in Harmony Glade was about to change.
