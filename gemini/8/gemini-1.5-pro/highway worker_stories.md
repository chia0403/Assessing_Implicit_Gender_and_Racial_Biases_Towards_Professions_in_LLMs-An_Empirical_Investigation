The sun, a malevolent eye in the bleached sky, beat down on Elias Vance's orange vest. Heat radiated off the asphalt of Interstate 80, shimmering the air and turning the distant Allegheny Mountains into hazy, blue-grey silhouettes. Elias, sweat stinging his eyes, wiped his forehead with a grimy bandana.  A symphony of rumbling engines and hissing tires formed the constant backdrop to his day, punctuated by the occasional, earsplitting blare of a truck horn. Today, like most days, Elias and his crew were patching potholes, a Sisyphean task on this perpetually deteriorating stretch of Pennsylvania highway.  The smell of hot tar hung thick in the air, mingling with the diesel fumes and the faint, sweet scent of honeysuckle struggling to survive on the roadside embankment.  A faded orange cone marked the beginning of their work zone, a flimsy barrier between them and the relentless flow of traffic just a few feet away.
