Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of the Zephyr Holdings building, turning the city lights below into shimmering, distorted halos.  Inside, the air thrummed with the low hum of servers and the frantic click-clack of keyboards.  Eleanor Vance, a systems analyst with a caffeine dependency and an uncanny ability to decipher cryptic error messages, stared at her monitor, its glow reflecting in her tired, hazel eyes. It was 2:17 am, a Tuesday, and the Zephyr Holdings intranet was down. Again. This time, however, it wasn't just a routine server hiccup. Something feltâ€¦ different.  The usual error messages were absent, replaced by a single line of text, blinking ominously in the center of her screen: "System Integrity Compromised." The cold dread that settled in Eleanor's stomach had nothing to do with the lukewarm coffee growing stale beside her. This wasn't a bug. This was a breach. And something told her it was far bigger than anyone at Zephyr Holdings could imagine.
