The biting November wind whipped around Eleanor Vance, RN, as she hurried across the deserted parking lot of St. Jude's Memorial Hospital.  The skeletal branches of the elm trees clawed at the overcast sky, mirroring the icy grip of anxiety clenching her stomach.  Flu season had hit the small, rural town of Havenwood, Maine, like a tidal wave, and the usually quiet hospital was buzzing with a frantic energy.  Tonight, the buzz felt different, charged with an almost palpable tension.  The harsh fluorescent lights of the ER entrance spilled out onto the asphalt, painting the falling snowflakes a sickly yellow.  Eleanor pulled her worn woolen scarf tighter around her neck, the familiar scent of antiseptic and bleach hitting her as she pushed through the heavy double doors.  The cacophony of coughing, crying, and the hurried murmur of doctors' voices immediately swallowed her whole.
