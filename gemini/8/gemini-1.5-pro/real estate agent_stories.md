The crisp October air, scented with woodsmoke and decaying leaves, whipped around Amelia Grace Hawthorne as she adjusted the "For Sale" sign.  It leaned precariously against the rusted wrought-iron fence surrounding the Hemlock House, a once-grand Victorian on the outskirts of Hollow Creek, Vermont.  Hollow Creek was a town clinging stubbornly to the edges of its faded glory, a place where time seemed to move slower, thick as maple syrup in January. The house, with its peeling paint and overgrown gardens, mirrored the town's wistful decline.  Amelia, however, saw potential.  She always did. This was her specialty â€“ finding the diamond in the rough, the forgotten beauty beneath the dust and cobwebs, and polishing it until it gleamed. But even Amelia felt a prickle of unease as the wind howled through the skeletal branches of the ancient elm that loomed over the property, its shadow stretching across the lawn like a skeletal hand.  This house held secrets, she could feel it in her bones.  And in Hollow Creek, secrets had a way of staying buried...until they didn't.
