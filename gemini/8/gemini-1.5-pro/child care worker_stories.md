The fluorescent lights of the "Little Wonders Daycare" hummed a monotonous tune, punctuated by the rhythmic squeak of a swing set outside.  Rain lashed against the large picture windows, blurring the view of the overgrown playground into a swirling green mess. Inside, the air hung thick with the mingled scents of crayon wax, disinfectant, and the faint, ever-present aroma of strained peas. Amelia “Amy” Rose Hawthorne, her curly auburn hair pulled back in a messy bun, sighed, wiping a stray streak of finger paint from her cheek with a damp paper towel.  It was 3:00 pm on a dreary Tuesday in late October, the kind of day that made even the most energetic toddlers clingy and irritable. The usual cacophony of squeals and shouts had subsided into a low, rumbling murmur, broken only by the occasional wail of frustration.  Amy surveyed her domain, a brightly colored room cluttered with building blocks, discarded art projects, and miniature plastic furniture.  She felt a pang of exhaustion, but a genuine smile warmed her face as a small hand tugged at her paint-splattered smock.  It was going to be a long afternoon.
