The biting November wind whipped at Elias Thorne's cheeks, turning them the same shade as the crimson oak leaves he was raking into a neat pile.  Frost crunched under his worn leather boots as he worked in the sprawling garden of the old Blackwood Manor.  The sprawling estate, nestled deep in the Hudson Valley, was a tapestry of dying glory.  Maples blazed orange and gold, while skeletal branches of birch trees clawed at a sky the color of bruised plums.  Elias, his breath clouding the crisp air, surveyed his work.  Heâ€™d been meticulously tending the Blackwood gardens for five years, and despite the creeping chill of late autumn, a quiet satisfaction settled over him.  He loved this place, the hushed tranquility broken only by the rustling of leaves and the distant cry of a hawk circling overhead.  He even loved the grand, slightly gothic manor itself, its dark windows watching him like silent, knowing eyes.  Little did he know, those windows held more than just silent observation. They held secrets, secrets that were about to unravel and entangle Elias in a story far beyond the quiet life of a landscaper.
