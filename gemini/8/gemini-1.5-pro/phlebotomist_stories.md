The fluorescent lights of St. Jude's Hospital hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack Amelia Reyes had grown accustomed to over her five years as a phlebotomist.  The pre-dawn chill clung to the air, even inside, and Amelia rubbed her hands together, trying to coax some warmth into her fingers before her first patient arrived. Phlebotomy Lab A, her usual domain, was a compact space, painted in a shade of pale green supposedly meant to soothe patients, but which Amelia always thought resembled something slightly off, like a lime Jolly Rancher left out in the sun too long.  This morning, the only other occupant was the coffee machine, gurgling contentedly in the corner, its aroma a welcome counterpoint to the faint metallic tang that perpetually hung in the air. Outside, the Chicago skyline was just beginning to blush pink with the promise of sunrise, a view largely obscured by the imposing brick buildings surrounding the hospital. Today, however, Amelia had a feeling that something was about to disrupt the predictable rhythm of her workday.
