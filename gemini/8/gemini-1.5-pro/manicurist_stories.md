The insistent New Orleans humidity clung to Magnolia “Maggie” Broussard like a second skin, plastering her floral sundress to her back.  It was the kind of heat that made sweet tea taste like salvation and wilted even the hardiest of bougainvillea. Inside “The Polished Pearl,” Maggie’s tiny nail salon tucked between a po'boy shop and a voodoo apothecary on Decatur Street, the air hung thick and fragrant with acetone and the sugary scent of the mango lotion she’d just used on Mrs. Dubois.  Sunlight, filtered through the dusty lace curtains, cast dancing shadows on the pastel walls adorned with framed pictures of elaborate nail art.  A chipped, ceramic cat figurine, a relic from her grandmother’s salon, watched serenely from the cluttered counter, its painted emerald eyes seeming to follow Maggie’s every move as she swept up a scattering of glitter. The afternoon lull had settled over the French Quarter, the usual cacophony of street musicians and chattering tourists replaced by a drowsy hum.  Maggie, however, felt anything but drowsy.  A strange disquiet, like the premonition of a summer storm, was brewing in her gut.
