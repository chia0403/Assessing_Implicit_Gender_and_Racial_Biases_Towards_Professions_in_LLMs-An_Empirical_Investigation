The Nevada sun beat down on the cab of the Peterbilt 389, baking the turquoise paint until it shimmered like a mirage. Dust devils danced across the cracked asphalt of Highway 50, the so-called “Loneliest Road in America,” living up to its name this sweltering July afternoon.  Inside, with the AC struggling against the desert heat, Delilah “Dee” Montgomery squinted at the shimmering road ahead, the rhythmic drone of the engine a familiar lullaby. Her calloused fingers, tanned from years gripping a steering wheel, tapped out a restless beat on the dash. Dee’s CB radio crackled to life, a burst of static followed by a gravelly voice: “Breaker one-nine, anybody out there seein’ Smokey bear on this stretch?” Dee chuckled, adjusting the microphone clipped to her visor.  This leg of her haul, from Reno to Ely with a load of mining equipment, was usually uneventful.  But something about the stillness of the air, the way the heat seemed to press down, told her this trip might be different.
