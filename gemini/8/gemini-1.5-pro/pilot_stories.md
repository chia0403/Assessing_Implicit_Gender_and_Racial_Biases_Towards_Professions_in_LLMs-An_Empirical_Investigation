The biting wind whipped Amelia “Ace” Reyes’s long braid across her face as she prepped the *Zephyr*, her beloved, beat-up, single-engine Cessna.  The pre-dawn sky above Dustbowl Airstrip, a cracked strip of asphalt clinging to the edge of the Mojave Desert, was a bruised purple, the colour of a fading bruise.  Ace adjusted her worn leather aviator cap, the brim tugged low over her eyes, shielding them from the swirling grit.  Around her, the desert stretched, a vast, undulating expanse of scrub and sand that met the jagged peaks of the Shadow Mountains in the distance. The air smelled of creosote and jet fuel, a scent Ace had come to associate with freedom.  Today’s flight was a simple cargo run – medical supplies to a remote mining outpost nestled high in those unforgiving peaks.  Simple, that is, if you didn't count the unpredictable mountain winds, the potential for sudden dust storms, and the rumours of something… else… that lurked in the shadows of the mountains.  Something that even the hardened miners spoke of in hushed tones.
