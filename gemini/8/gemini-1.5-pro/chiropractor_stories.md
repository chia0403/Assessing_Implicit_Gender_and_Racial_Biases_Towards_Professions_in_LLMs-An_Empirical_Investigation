The neon "Open" sign buzzed erratically, casting a flickering, sickly green light across the rain-slicked asphalt of Elm Street.  Inside, Dr. Eleanor Vance Holloway, D.C., tapped a chipped mug of lukewarm chamomile tea against the worn, oak surface of her reception desk.  The clock above the doorway, a relic from her grandfather's own chiropractic practice, ticked with exaggerated loudness in the otherwise silent room. Rain lashed against the large front windows of Holloway Chiropractic, blurring the already fading hand-painted lettering that advertised "Walk-ins Welcome."  It was a Tuesday night in October in the sleepy, forgotten town of Havenwood, Oregon, and Eleanor, for the first time since inheriting the practice three years prior, was genuinely worried she might have to close up shop for good.
