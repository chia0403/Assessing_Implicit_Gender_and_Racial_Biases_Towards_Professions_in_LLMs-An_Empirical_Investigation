Okay, here's a story opening and setting centered around a probation officer named Evelyn Rose Thatcher:

**Story Opening:**

The scent of stale coffee and simmering anxiety hung heavy in the air of the Willow Creek Probation Office, a miasma Evelyn Rose Thatcher had grown tragically accustomed to. Sunlight, thin and apologetic, squeezed through the grimy blinds, illuminating dust motes dancing a macabre waltz. She chewed on the end of her pen, staring at the mountain of files on her desk, each a testament to broken promises and shattered lives. This Monday morning felt particularly oppressive, a lead weight pressing down on her chest. Not just because of the backlog, not just because of the perpetual understaffing, but because of the name scrawled across the top of the file directly in front of her: "Kyle Harding." He was due in at 10:00 AM, and the thought of facing him again made the lukewarm coffee curdle in her stomach. He was a mistake waiting to happen, a volatile mix of simmering rage and desperate hope she wasn't sure she possessed the skills to navigate.

**Setting:**

The story is primarily set in **Willow Creek, a small, economically depressed town nestled in the Appalachian foothills of West Virginia.** Willow Creek was once a thriving coal mining community, but after the mines closed down decades ago, the town has struggled with poverty, addiction, and a pervasive sense of hopelessness. The landscape is beautiful, with rolling hills and dense forests, but the beauty is often marred by the scars of strip mining and the neglect of abandoned buildings.

Specifically, the main locations are:

*   **The Willow Creek Probation Office:** A cramped, underfunded government building located on the outskirts of town. It is characterized by its peeling paint, flickering fluorescent lights, and the weary resignation of its staff. The atmosphere is a mixture of bureaucratic drudgery and the raw emotions of the people cycling through. The waiting room is always full of people struggling with everything from drug addiction to petty theft.
*   **Evelyn's modest home:** A small, slightly dilapidated house she inherited from her grandmother, located on a quiet street a few blocks from the town square. It's cluttered with books and plants, a sanctuary she tries to create amidst the chaos of her work.
*   **Various locations throughout Willow Creek:** These might include trailer parks, rundown bars, abandoned mines, and the struggling businesses that barely manage to stay afloat. These locations will help illustrate the socio-economic challenges of the town and the lives of the people Evelyn is trying to help.

The setting plays a vital role in the story, reflecting the challenges and struggles faced by the characters. It's a place where hope is often hard to come by, but where resilience and community still flicker beneath the surface.
