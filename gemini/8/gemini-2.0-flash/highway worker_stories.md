**Setting:**

The merciless Nevada sun beat down on the ribbon of asphalt known as Highway 95, baking the already cracked surface to an almost unbearable temperature. Mirages shimmered in the distance, playing tricks on the eye, making distant Joshua trees appear as shimmering oases. The landscape was a study in muted browns and tans, punctuated by the occasional hardy shrub stubbornly clinging to life. Dust devils danced across the barren plains, miniature whirlwinds kicking up grit and grime. The air was thick and heavy, smelling of hot tar and the faintest hint of sagebrush. The only sounds were the hum of distant traffic, the occasional cry of a hawk circling overhead, and the rhythmic thud of roadwork equipment. This particular stretch of highway, about twenty miles south of Tonopah, was notoriously bad, riddled with potholes and cracks that threatened to swallow unsuspecting tires.

**Story Opening:**

The hammer swung with practiced ease, each strike driving the orange traffic cone a little deeper into the cracked asphalt.  He wiped the sweat from his brow with the back of a calloused hand, leaving a smear of grime across his forehead.  **Elijah James "Eli" Walker**,  a man built like a desert boulder, with sun-leathered skin and eyes the color of the storm clouds that rarely graced this arid landscape, surveyed his work with a critical eye. Cone perfectly aligned. Safety secured.  Another small victory against the relentless forces of the Nevada desert.  He knew the futility of it all – tomorrow the sun and the relentless traffic would conspire to undo his efforts, but today, at least, this stretch of highway would be a little safer thanks to him.

He took a swig of lukewarm water from his dented thermos, the metallic tang doing little to quench his thirst.  He’d been working this stretch of highway for fifteen years, patching, sealing, and praying that one day, the state would actually invest in a proper resurfacing project.  But the promises always came and went like the dust devils, leaving only the same old cracked asphalt and the endless, sun-baked horizon.  Today, though, something felt different.  A prickling unease settled at the back of his neck, a feeling as familiar as the ache in his back and the grit between his teeth.  He couldn't quite put his finger on it, but the vast, silent landscape felt…watched.  He scanned the horizon again, half expecting to see a coyote slinking through the brush, but there was nothing. Just the endless expanse of desert, the oppressive heat, and that nagging sense of foreboding that whispered in the silence.
