## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights of H&R Block hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Arthur Penhaligon's impending seasonal demise. He chewed on the end of his pen, the familiar metallic tang doing little to soothe his frayed nerves. He'd already ingested half a box of lemon drops, his only weapon against the encroaching spreadsheet fatigue. Outside, the blustery March wind howled, mirroring the internal tempest brewing within him. Another tax season, another avalanche of W-2s, 1099s, and enough receipts to paper the entire city of Oakhaven. And this year, the whispers of impending automation, the rumors of AI taking over his job, felt louder than ever.

## Setting:

The Oakhaven H&R Block branch was nestled between a struggling laundromat and a perpetually under-construction deli on Elm Street. Its once-vibrant green sign was now faded and peeling at the edges, a testament to the neighborhood's slow decline. Inside, the walls were painted a sterile, institutional beige, punctuated by motivational posters featuring stock photos of smiling families receiving generous tax refunds. Arthur's cramped cubicle, number 3B, was a fortress of organized chaos, overflowing with tax law books, half-eaten snacks, and a small framed photograph of his grumpy-looking tabby cat, Winston. The air hung heavy with the scent of cheap coffee and desperation.
