The scent of pine and sawdust hung thick in the air, clinging to the worn denim apron and dusting the bristled beard of Silas Blackwood. Outside, the coastal wind howled a mournful song against the weathered clapboard of his workshop, mimicking the low groan of the ancient oak tree that had been his steadfast companion since childhood. It was a late October evening in Port Blossom, Maine, a town where the rhythm of life was dictated by the tides and the clang of lobster traps.

Silas straightened, his back protesting with a symphony of pops and clicks. He ran a calloused hand over the smooth, unfinished surface of the cradle he was crafting. The wood was cherry, a deep, warm red that seemed to glow even in the dim light filtering through the grimy windows. He imagined the tiny face that would soon rest there, the soft gurgles and sighs that would fill the silence with life. He'd carved a delicate border of wildflowers around the edges, each petal meticulously rendered, a small act of love poured into the wood.

Tonight, however, the beauty of his creation offered little solace. A knot of anxiety tightened in his chest, as persistent and stubborn as the toughest oak. He knew he should be feeling joy, excitement even. After all, this was his first grandchild. But instead, a wave of unease washed over him, a premonition that something was amiss, carried on the salt-laced wind that rattled the very foundations of his workshop.
