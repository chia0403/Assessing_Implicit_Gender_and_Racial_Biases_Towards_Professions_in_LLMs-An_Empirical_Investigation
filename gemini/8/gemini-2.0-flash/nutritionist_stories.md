The aroma of freshly baked sourdough warred with the lingering scent of garlic and anxiety that seemed perpetually trapped within the walls of Nourish & Thrive, Dr. Anya Sharma's nutrition clinic. Sunlight, weak and watery like diluted broth, strained through the frosted glass window, doing little to illuminate the room. Anya chewed the inside of her cheek, her gaze fixed on the rhythmic sway of the hanging air plant she'd impulsively bought last week. It was supposed to purify the air, but judging by the persistent hum of stress she felt buzzing in her chest, it wasn't earning its keep.

The setting was a converted Victorian townhouse in the rapidly gentrifying neighborhood of Northwood Heights, Philadelphia. The exterior, once grand and imposing, now sported peeling paint and a mismatched collection of security cameras, a testament to the neighborhood's uneasy transition. Inside, Anya had attempted to create a calming oasis. Pale sage green walls were adorned with framed prints of vibrant fruits and vegetables, and soft, instrumental music trickled from hidden speakers. She'd even splurged on comfortable, ergonomic chairs. Despite her best efforts, however, a certain clinical sterility pervaded. The weight of expectation, of diets failed and dreams dashed, clung to the air like a stubborn fog. Today, she was bracing herself for another deluge, another patient clinging to the hope that Anya held the magic key to unlock their perfect, healthy self.
