## Story Opening:

The humid Louisiana air hung thick and heavy, a living, breathing thing that clung to everything it touched. Alphonse "Al" Broussard, a man built like a seasoned oak, wiped the sweat from his brow with the back of a calloused hand, leaving a smudge of lather across his forehead. He sighed, a sound like air escaping a deflated tire. He was already drenched, and it wasn't even 9:00 AM. The cicadas outside his shop, "Alphonse's Cuts & Shaves," were deafening, a constant buzz that vibrated through the wooden floorboards and settled in his teeth like a gritty film. Today was shaping up to be a scorcher, and Alphonse had a feeling it was going to be a long one. He adjusted the worn leather strap on his favorite barber's chair and stared out the dusty front window. The only thing moving on Cypress Street was a stray dog, scavenging for scraps in the gutter. He hoped someone would walk through that door soon. He needed the company, and frankly, he needed the business.

## Setting:

Alphonse's Cuts & Shaves was a small, unassuming building painted a faded shade of robin's egg blue. Its paint peeled in places, revealing patches of bare wood underneath, testament to years of relentless sun and the occasional hurricane. A hand-painted sign, featuring a somewhat lopsided razor blade, swung gently from the porch roof. Inside, the shop was a time capsule. Two well-worn barber's chairs, upholstered in cracked and patched brown leather, faced a long, mirrored wall. Underneath the mirror, a cluttered counter held an array of combs, brushes, shaving creams, and aftershaves, all arranged in a haphazard fashion that only Alphonse understood. 

The air was thick with the lingering scent of bay rum, talcum powder, and the faintest hint of sawdust. A vintage radio, perched precariously on a shelf cluttered with faded photographs and knick-knacks, crackled with static and the occasional burst of country music. The walls were adorned with hunting trophies - a deer head with one antler missing, a stuffed bass that was losing its scales - and framed photographs of past customers, frozen in time with their neatly trimmed hair. It was a place steeped in history, a cornerstone of the small, tight-knit community of Cypress Cove, Louisiana, and Alphonse Broussard was its undisputed keeper.
