Okay, here's a story opening and setting, including a main character with a full name and occupation:

**Setting:**

The biting November wind whipped off Lake Michigan and slammed against the tall glass windows of the Anderson & Burke Insurance building in downtown Chicago. Inside, the fluorescent lights buzzed, casting a sterile glow on the cubicle farm stretching as far as the eye could see. A faint scent of stale coffee and desperation hung in the air, thick enough to choke on. Holiday decorations, painfully premature, adorned some cubicles: a plastic snowman with a chipped nose, a string of tangled Christmas lights, and a single, droopy paper snowflake.

**Story Opening:**

"Another rejection," murmured Rosalind "Roz" Anya Sharma, running a hand through her perpetually messy bun. The words blurred slightly on her monitor, reflecting the exhaustion that had settled deep in her bones. She massaged her temples, trying to ward off the headache she felt brewing, fueled by too little sleep and too much lukewarm office coffee. She'd spent the last three hours cold-calling potential clients, pitching Anderson & Burke's new group life insurance plan with all the enthusiasm she could muster. And for what? Three hang-ups, five curt "no's," and one man who claimed to be waiting for a call from Prince Harry.

Roz glanced at the whiteboard she had propped against the back of her cubicle. It was plastered with inspirational quotes and sales targets. Underneath them, a hastily scrawled note in bright pink marker stood out: "Q4 Bonus â€“ Hawaii or bust!" She sighed. Hawaii felt like a million miles away, as unattainable as a personal audience with the actual Prince Harry. This was the last week of the quarter, and Roz was still significantly short of her quota. She wasn't sure if she was more afraid of disappointing her boss, Mr. Henderson, or disappointing herself.
