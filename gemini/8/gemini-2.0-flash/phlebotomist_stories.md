Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a phlebotomist named Amelia Jean Hawthorne:

**Setting:** The sterile, brightly lit waiting room of the "Sunrise Valley Senior Wellness Center" on a Tuesday morning. The walls are painted a calming, albeit generic, shade of pale green. A muted television plays a continuous loop of nature documentaries, currently showcasing the vibrant plumage of a parrot in the Amazon rainforest. Three vinyl chairs are occupied by elderly individuals, each holding a well-worn copy of "Reader's Digest" or staring blankly at the floor. The air smells faintly of disinfectant and nervous anticipation.

**Opening:**

The whirring of the centrifuge was Amelia Jean Hawthorne's white noise, her lullaby in the sterile symphony of the Sunrise Valley Senior Wellness Center. She hummed along, barely audible, to the mechanical drone, her gloved hands meticulously labeling vials of blood with the delicate precision of a calligrapher.  "Mrs. Gable, Mrs. Gable," she murmured, affixing a label to a lavender-topped tube.  "That's three down, seventeen to go."  Amelia wasn't usually one for dreading Mondays or finding solace in Tuesdays. But on Mondays, the patient load was heavier, fueled by weekend indulgences and the lingering anxieties of a Sunday spent contemplating mortality. Today, however, was just a normal Tuesday. And she was already running behind.
