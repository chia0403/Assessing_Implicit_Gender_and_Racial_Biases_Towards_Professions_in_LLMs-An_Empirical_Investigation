Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a drafting worker:

**Setting:**

The year is 1952. The air in the office of "Stanton, Briggs & Associates, Architectural Designers" hangs thick with the smell of pipe tobacco, stale coffee, and the distinctive tang of ammonia from the blueprint machine. Sunlight, weak and filtered through perpetually smudged windows, struggles to illuminate the vast drafting room. Row upon row of drafting tables, each a miniature landscape of pencils, rulers, protractors, and partially completed blueprints, stretch into the distance. The room is a hive of activity, a cacophony of clattering t-squares, the low hum of conversation, and the occasional sharp, frustrated sigh. Outside, the bustling streets of Chicago rumble and groan, a constant reminder of the city's relentless energy, a contrast to the focused, meticulous work being undertaken within these walls.

**Story Opening:**

Margaret Eleanor Davies hated the smell of ammonia. It clung to everything – her clothes, her hair, even the cream she meticulously layered onto her dry hands each morning. But more than the smell, she hated the way it always seemed to permeate her dreams, a ghostly blue haze obscuring the intricate details she so desperately craved to see.

This morning, the scent was particularly potent, a physical manifestation of the looming deadline for the Westview Apartments blueprints. Margaret hunched over her drafting table, the soft lead of her pencil gliding across the vellum. She adjusted her spectacles, the bridge pinching her nose, and squinted at the complex network of lines representing the plumbing system for the third floor. Mr. Briggs, a man whose mustache rivaled his own booming voice, had been breathing down her neck all week. “Faster, Davies, faster!” he’d bellowed, seemingly oblivious to the fact that rushing only led to mistakes, mistakes that would cost Stanton, Briggs & Associates dearly.

A sharp rap on her table startled her.

"Davies," a voice clipped and precise, cut through the drafting room din. "Mr. Stanton wants to see you. Immediately."

Margaret's stomach clenched. This was never good.
