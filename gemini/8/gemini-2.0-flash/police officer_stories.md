## Story Opening & Setting

**Setting:** The humid, pre-dawn air hung thick and heavy over the French Quarter of New Orleans, a miasma of stale beer, beignet sugar, and the faintest whiff of decay. Shadows clung to the wrought-iron balconies, obscuring the chipped paint and faded glory of the historic buildings. The only sounds were the rhythmic drip of a leaky faucet down a nearby alley and the distant, mournful wail of a tugboat on the Mississippi. The narrow, cobblestone street, Rue Royale, was mostly deserted, save for a few early risers setting up shop, and a scattering of discarded party favors from the night before - sequined masks, broken beads, and the ghost of a celebration clinging to the air.

**Opening:** Detective Sergeant Isabelle Marie Dubois shivered, pulling her worn leather jacket tighter around her. The humidity did little to ward off the early morning chill that seeped into her bones. She took a long drag from her lukewarm coffee, the bitter taste a necessary jolt after a long night. The flickering gas lamps cast long, distorted shadows across her face, emphasizing the lines etched around her weary eyes and the determined set of her jaw. She stared across the street at the open doorway of "Maison des Mystères," a dimly lit occult shop known for its potent brews, questionable fortune tellers, and a clientele that was, to put it mildly, eclectic. It was a place she usually avoided like the plague, but a phone call from the night watchman – and the unsettling discovery within - had dragged her back into the Quarter's murky heart once more.
