## Story Opening:

The scent of lemon and lavender clung to the air, a signature fragrance meticulously crafted by Agnes Primrose, and now, it was failing to mask the rot. Agnes wrinkled her nose, a small, pinched expression that had become almost permanent after twenty years of battling the insidious decay that seemed to seep from the very walls of Blackwood Manor. The dampness, the age, the sheer neglect of its absentee owner - it was all a relentless assault on Agnesâ€™s senses, a constant reminder of the slow, agonizing demise of a once-grand house.

She sighed, adjusting the slightly crooked floral scarf around her neck, and continued polishing the mahogany banister, the wood gleaming dully under her efforts. Today was a day for deeper cleaning. Mr. Archibald Blackwood, the recluse and owner, was due for his annual, hour-long visit. Agnes hadn't seen him in person in over a year, the upkeep of the estate handled remotely, and the communication terse and always conducted through his solicitor. Still, a ritual was a ritual. Blackwood Manor had to be presentable, even if its resident never truly was.

## Setting:

**Blackwood Manor** stands precariously on the windswept Cornish coast, a gothic behemoth of grey stone and crumbling crenellations. Years of salty air and relentless gales have taken their toll, etching deep lines into the building's facade and leaving a perpetual layer of dampness clinging to its interior. Inside, the house is a labyrinth of shadowed corridors, echoing halls, and rooms filled with antique furniture shrouded in dust sheets. The grandeur is still faintly visible in the intricate carvings, the soaring ceilings, and the faded tapestries depicting scenes of long-forgotten battles and hunts. Yet, the overwhelming impression is one of decay and abandonment, a beautiful ghost of its former self, clinging desperately to the cliffside, much like Agnes herself. The manor is surrounded by overgrown gardens, once meticulously manicured but now a riot of wild roses, tangled ivy, and gnarled, wind-battered trees. The air is thick with the smell of salt and decaying vegetation, a constant reminder of the relentless power of nature and the enduring spirit of a house refusing to surrender to the elements.
