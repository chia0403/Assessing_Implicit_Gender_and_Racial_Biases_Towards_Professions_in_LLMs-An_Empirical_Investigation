## Story Opening:

The rhythmic rasp of the crystal file against acrylic was the only sound anchoring Esmeralda "Esme" Valentina Diaz to reality. Outside, the Miami sunshine was a screaming, neon advertisement for joy – a joy Esme felt about as deeply as the fake nails she buffed to a high gloss. Usually, the predictable routine, the familiar smells of acetone and rose-scented lotion, were her comfort. But today, the anxiety was a relentless tide, pulling her under with each meticulous stroke. Today was different. Today, Mrs. Beatrice Hawthorne, notorious for her sky-high expectations and equally high tipping, had requested a specific shade of red, a shade Esme had sworn she'd never see again. A shade that dredged up memories best left buried under layers of gel and glitter.

## Setting:

"La Belleza Nail Salon" was tucked into a vibrant corner of Little Havana. Bright murals depicting Cuban landscapes adorned the exterior walls, competing with the cacophony of salsa music spilling from the nearby domino park. Inside, the salon was a vibrant explosion of color. Walls painted a sunny yellow were adorned with framed pictures of flawlessly manicured hands. Four manicure stations, each with its own swiveling stool and arsenal of tools, faced a wall lined with hundreds of nail polish bottles, arranged in a rainbow spectrum. The air hung thick with the scent of acrylics, disinfectants, and a lingering sweetness from the guava pastries Esme’s abuela always brought on Thursdays. Despite the constant bustle of chattering clients, whirring fans, and the clack of nail clippers, La Belleza was a sanctuary, a place where women came to be pampered, to share gossip, and to leave feeling just a little bit brighter than they had arrived. At least, that's what Esme usually aimed for. Today, the sunshine outside felt like a spotlight, glaring down and amplifying the knot of dread tightening in her stomach.
