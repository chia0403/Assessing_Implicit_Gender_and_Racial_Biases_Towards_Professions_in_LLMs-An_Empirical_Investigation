Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a story with a cashier main character:

**Setting:**

The "Starlight Diner" was a greasy spoon clinging precariously to the edge of Highway 40, about twenty miles outside of Reno, Nevada. Neon stars flickered intermittently in the front window, casting a sickly glow on the cracked vinyl booths and the perpetually sticky countertops. The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee, frying bacon, and something vaguely metallic. A jukebox in the corner stubbornly played a loop of forgotten country tunes, occasionally punctuated by the clang of the kitchen door and the grumbled orders of Martha, the short-tempered cook.

**Story Opening:**

Beatrice "Bea" Eleanor McKinley hated Thursdays. Thursdays were the day truckers started rolling in off the early morning shifts, all bleary-eyed and demanding refills. Thursdays were the day tourists remembered they were hungry after gambling away their vacation funds. And Thursdays, most consistently, were the day old Mr. Henderson came in and tried to pay with Canadian pennies.

Bea sighed, idly wiping down the already clean countertop in front of her cash register. Her fingernails, chipped despite her best efforts to maintain a semblance of professional polish, clicked softly against the metal. She watched a lone tumbleweed dance across the empty highway, a feeling of shared desolation welling up inside her. Twenty-three years old, and this was her life. Punching numbers and enduring the early morning gripes of the Starlight Diner’s clientele. She’d dreamed of art school, of charcoal sketches and vibrant cityscapes. Instead, she was an expert at calculating tax on eggs benedict and preventing coin shortages. The bell above the diner door jingled, announcing another customer and shattering Bea’s fleeting moment of quiet. A man with eyes like chips of flint walked in, and Bea plastered a smile on her face. “Morning,” she chirped, already bracing herself for whatever Thursday would throw at her.
