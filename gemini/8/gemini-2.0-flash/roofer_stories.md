**Story Opening:**

The sun, a cruel, unforgiving hammer, beat down on the corrugated iron. Bartholomew "Bart" Finch wiped the sweat from his brow, his salt-laced handkerchief sticking uncomfortably to his skin. He could taste the grit of asphalt shingles in the air, a familiar flavor, a flavor that paid the bills. He gripped his hammer, the worn wood warm and familiar in his calloused hand, and swung, the rhythmic *thwack* echoing across the suburban landscape. Today's job wasn't just any roof; it was Mrs. Higgins' roof, and Mrs. Higgins was notorious. Notorious for her meticulously manicured rose bushes that Bart had to navigate precariously, notorious for her endless supply of iced tea (far too sweet, in his opinion), and most notoriously, for her eagle eye that missed absolutely nothing. He'd already re-positioned a stray shingle five times based on her "suggestions."

**Setting:**

The story is set in the fictional town of Willow Creek, nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains in North Carolina. It's late July, sweltering and humid. The air hangs heavy with the scent of pine and honeysuckle, a deceptive sweetness masking the oppressive heat. The houses are mostly ranch-style, built in the mid-20th century, each with its own carefully tended lawn and flowering shrubs. Mrs. Higgins' house, in particular, is a picture of suburban perfection, except, of course, for the leaky roof that Bartholomew Finch was currently battling. The surrounding streets are quiet, save for the occasional lawnmower and the distant drone of traffic. Willow Creek is a place where time seems to move a little slower, a place where everyone knows everyone else, and gossip travels faster than the summer breeze. The towering Blue Ridge mountains provide a constant, beautiful backdrop, a stark contrast to the mundane routines of everyday life.
