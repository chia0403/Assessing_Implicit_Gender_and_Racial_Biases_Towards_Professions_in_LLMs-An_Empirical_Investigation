The fluorescent lights of the "Accountant's Corner" strip mall buzzed a relentless, monotonous hum, a sonic wallpaper that mirrored the predictable rhythm of Priscilla Penelope Plumtree's life. She adjusted her spectacles, perched precariously on the bridge of her nose, and sighed. Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the cheap aluminum siding and threatening to rip the gaudy "We Fix Your Taxes!" banner from its moorings. Priscilla glanced at the swirling grey sky, the colour of lukewarm gruel, and shivered. It was late October in Grimblewood, Ohio, and the joy of Pumpkin Spice season had long since curdled into a damp, bone-chilling pre-winter malaise.

Inside, Priscilla's office, "Plumtree's Precise Profit," was a testament to order and a quiet battle against the encroaching chaos of the outside world. Every pen was aligned perfectly in its holder, every file meticulously labeled and stacked. The air smelled faintly of paper and lemon-scented disinfectant, a scent Priscilla found oddly comforting. The only splash of colour came from a wilting African violet, a gift from her eccentric Aunt Mildred, which sat stubbornly on the window sill, attempting, and mostly failing, to inject a bit of life into the dreary space.

Priscilla Penelope Plumtree, a woman of forty-two with a penchant for sensible cardigans and a deep, unwavering love for a balanced ledger, was wrestling with the accounts of "Grimblewood's Goofy Golf," a miniature golf course notorious for its collapsing windmill and perpetually broken water feature. As usual, something didn't quite add up.
