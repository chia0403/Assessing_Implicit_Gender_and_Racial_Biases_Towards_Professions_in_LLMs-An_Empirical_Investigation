## Story Opening:

The rain, a persistent, needling drizzle, clung to the brim of Jack Rourke’s fedora and plastered it to his forehead. He pushed it back with a grunt, the action revealing more of a face that could generously be described as “lived-in.” Deep lines etched themselves around his perpetually narrowed blue eyes, and a network of tiny broken capillaries painted his nose the color of aged brick. The dame on the other end of the line hadn't sounded like much, but even a simple missing cat case was better than staring at the peeling wallpaper in his office.

He pulled the collar of his trench coat tighter around his throat and double-checked the address scribbled on a damp scrap of paper: 32 Hemlock Lane. The wrought iron gate, rusted and overgrown with ivy, creaked open with a mournful sigh as he pushed it. This wasn't just Hemlock Lane, this was Hemlock *Mansion* Lane. And judging by the silence emanating from the place, it was likely as haunted as it looked. Jack just hoped the ghost hadn't made off with the missing feline.

## Setting:

**Location:** The story opens on a dreary, late autumn evening in the fictional coastal town of Ashwood, Massachusetts. Ashwood is a place steeped in New England history, a blend of picturesque charm and quiet secrets. The town is characterized by:

*   **Victorian Architecture:** Grand, but often decaying, Victorian mansions line the older streets, remnants of a prosperous shipbuilding past.
*   **Coastal Setting:** The salty air and the ever-present sound of crashing waves are a constant reminder of the town's proximity to the Atlantic Ocean. A working harbor is a hub of activity, though it has seen better days.
*   **Melancholy Atmosphere:** Ashwood carries a pervasive sense of melancholy, a feeling of forgotten glory and secrets buried beneath layers of time. The overcast skies and frequent rain contribute to the overall mood.
*   **Wealthy, Established Families:** The town is home to a few very old, very wealthy families, who hold a significant amount of power and influence within the community. Their affairs are often shrouded in mystery.

**Specifically, the opening scene takes place outside the grand but decaying Hemlock Mansion.** The mansion is situated at the end of a long, winding driveway lined with gnarled trees. It is a three-story Victorian structure with pointed turrets, ornate carvings, and numerous dark, unlit windows. The grounds are overgrown with ivy and weeds, giving the impression of neglect and isolation.

## Main Character:

**Full Name:** Jack Rourke

**Occupation:** Private Detective

**Personality:** A cynical and world-weary individual with a strong moral compass buried beneath a gruff exterior. He's seen too much of the dark side of human nature, but still clings to a belief in justice. He possesses a sharp mind, keen observational skills, and a dry sense of humor. He also has a soft spot for a stiff drink and a good dame, though experience has taught him to be wary of both.
