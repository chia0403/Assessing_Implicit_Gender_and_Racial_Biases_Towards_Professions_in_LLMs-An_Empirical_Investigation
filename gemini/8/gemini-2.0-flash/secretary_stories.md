Okay, here's a story opening and setting, with a secretary as the main character:

**Story Opening:**

The rhythmic clatter of the typewriter was a familiar comfort to Agnes Beatrice Plumtree. It was a steady, predictable sound in a world that often felt anything but. This morning, though, even the comforting rhythm couldn't quite quell the flutter of unease in her stomach. Mr. Abernathy had summoned her to his office first thing, a summons delivered with a strange, almost apologetic, expression by young Timothy from Accounting. And Mr. Abernathy *never* apologized. Especially not to his secretary.

Agnes finished typing the last line of the memo regarding the firm's annual picnic – a picnic she had meticulously planned, down to the precisely portioned potato salad – and took a deep breath. Her fingers trembled slightly as she placed the memo in the "Out" basket and smoothed down her sensible, navy blue skirt. It was just a chat, she told herself. Perhaps a new project. Or maybe… maybe he finally appreciated all the extra hours she'd put in, the countless fires she’d put out, the sheer, tireless dedication she poured into Abernathy, Finch & Stern.

She straightened her shoulders, adjusted the collar of her starched white blouse, and knocked lightly on the mahogany door.

"Come in," Mr. Abernathy's voice, usually booming and imperious, was strangely subdued.

Agnes turned the doorknob and stepped into the lion's den.

**Setting:**

The setting is 1950s New York City. Agnes works as a secretary at Abernathy, Finch & Stern, a mid-sized law firm specializing in corporate law.

*   **Office:** The firm is located in a stately, if slightly outdated, building in the Financial District. Agnes's workspace is a small, somewhat cramped office just outside Mr. Abernathy's corner office. It's filled with the essential tools of the secretarial trade: a large, manual typewriter, a rotary dial telephone, a filing cabinet overflowing with documents, and a calendar meticulously marked with appointments and deadlines. The walls are painted a pale green, and a framed print of a pastoral scene hangs crookedly above her desk.
*   **Abernathy's Office:** Mr. Abernathy’s office is a stark contrast to Agnes’s. Large and impressive, it boasts a panoramic view of the city skyline. Heavy oak furniture, including a massive desk and leather armchairs, gives the room a sense of power and authority. Sunlight streams through the large windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air.
*   **General Atmosphere:** The atmosphere of the firm is formal and hierarchical. There is a clear pecking order, and Agnes, as a secretary, is near the bottom. Despite the rigid structure, there's also a sense of camaraderie among the staff, forged from shared deadlines, late nights, and the constant pressure to meet Mr. Abernathy's demanding expectations. The air is thick with cigarette smoke, the smell of old paper, and the faint aroma of strong coffee.
