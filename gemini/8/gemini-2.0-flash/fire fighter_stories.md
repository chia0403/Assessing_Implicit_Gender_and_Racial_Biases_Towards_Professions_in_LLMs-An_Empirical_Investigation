The biting wind whipped off the Atlantic, carrying the scent of salt and the promise of a coming nor'easter. Inside Station 17, the low hum of the generator fought a losing battle against the rhythmic clang of the buoy bell out on the point. Smoke, not from a fire, but from the ancient, temperamental percolator, curled lazily towards the ceiling. Across the room, wrapped in a threadbare afghan knitted by his late grandmother, **Daniel Thomas Riley** sat nursing a lukewarm cup of the aforementioned brew. He stared out the grimy window, his gaze fixed on the angry, churning sea, a landscape he knew intimately, loved fiercely, and, on days like this, feared a little too much.

Station 17, perched precariously on the edge of the granite cliffs in the small fishing town of Port Providence, Maine, was less a fire station and more a family heirloom. Passed down through generations of Rileys, it was a ramshackle collection of peeling paint, chipped brick, and the ghosts of a hundred rescues. The building groaned with every gust of wind, a symphony of protest against the elements. The firetruck, a vintage Mack pumper affectionately nicknamed "The Bessie," was nearly as old as the station itself, its chrome gleaming dully under the fluorescent lights. Here, time seemed to move slower, the present constantly overlaid with the memories of the past. And today, with the storm brewing on the horizon, those memories felt particularly heavy.
