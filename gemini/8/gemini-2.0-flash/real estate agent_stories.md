## Story Opening:

The rhythmic thud of Agnes Montgomery’s heels against the polished marble floor echoed through the empty foyer, a lonely soundtrack to her growing sense of dread. At 5:58 PM, two minutes before the scheduled open house, the only sign of life at 12 Magnolia Drive was Agnes, her carefully coiffed blonde bob starting to wilt in the unseasonably humid August air. The perfectly positioned fliers in their lucite stands were untouched, the miniature cookies from "Crumbs & Co." remained uneaten on their silver platter, and the air, meticulously sprayed with a "vanilla bean and cedar" fragrance, clung thick and expectant. This wasn’t just a slow Tuesday afternoon open house; this felt like a monumental, career-threatening failure. Agnes swallowed, forcing a smile that felt more like a grimace. "Just gotta stay positive," she muttered to the vacant living room, the sound swallowed by the high ceilings and suffocating silence.

## Setting:

The story is set in **Bloomfield Estates, Connecticut**, a highly desirable, affluent suburb known for its meticulously manicured lawns, top-rated schools, and quiet, family-friendly atmosphere. 12 Magnolia Drive itself is a sprawling, five-bedroom Colonial Revival house situated on a generous, wooded lot. The house boasts all the hallmarks of Bloomfield Estates luxury: a gourmet kitchen with granite countertops and stainless steel appliances, a sun-drenched sunroom overlooking a meticulously maintained garden, a finished basement with a home theater, and a three-car garage. However, despite its undeniable beauty and prime location, the house has been on the market for three months with little interest, a fact that is weighing heavily on Agnes's professional reputation. The overall vibe is one of pristine perfection masking a potential undercurrent of boredom and unspoken secrets.
