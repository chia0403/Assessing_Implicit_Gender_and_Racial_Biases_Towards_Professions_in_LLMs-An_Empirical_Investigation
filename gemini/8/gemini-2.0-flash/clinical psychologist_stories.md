The chipped ceramic mug warmed Dr. Eleanor Vanceâ€™s hands as she stared out the rain-streaked window of her office. The late afternoon sky was a bruised purple, a mirror of the anxiety that clawed at her insides. The flickering fluorescent lights hummed a discordant tune, a fitting soundtrack to the unsettling case files stacked precariously on her desk. Eleanor hated Tuesdays. Tuesdays were always heavy.

Her office was nestled on the third floor of the weathered Victorian building housing "The Lakeside Wellness Collective" in the small, stubbornly quaint town of Havenwood, Maine. The building itself was a testament to the town's refusal to modernize - all gingerbread trim and peeling paint, overlooking the perpetually fog-shrouded expanse of Sebago Lake. Inside, Eleanor had attempted to create a sanctuary. The walls were painted a calming sage green, adorned with prints of Georgia O'Keeffe flowers. A comfortable, overstuffed armchair sat angled towards a worn oriental rug, a haven for the lost souls who sought solace within its faded patterns. But even the soft light of the antique Tiffany lamp on her side table couldn't quite dispel the feeling of a building steeped in history, a history that sometimes felt too heavy, too close. Today, especially, that history pressed down on her, a palpable weight in the quiet space.
