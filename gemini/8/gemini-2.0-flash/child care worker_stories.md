## Story Opening:

The squeak of miniature sneakers against linoleum was the soundtrack to Clara Eleanor Davies' mornings. This particular morning, it was accompanied by the insistent, albeit off-key, rendition of "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star" courtesy of four-year-old Leo, who seemed determined to use the volume of his vocal chords to compensate for his lack of pitch. Clara, armed with a half-eaten banana and a reservoir of patience she sometimes felt was as boundless as the sky, plastered on a smile and navigated the chaotic sea of building blocks and discarded artwork. "That's a beautiful song, Leo!" she called out, mentally adding "find earplugs" to her ever-growing to-do list.

## Setting:

**The "Little Acorns" Child Care Center** occupied a converted Victorian house on Elm Street, a quiet, tree-lined avenue in the heart of Maplewood, a quaint suburban town an hour outside of the city. The house, once a grand family home, had been lovingly adapted to cater to the energetic whims of toddlers and preschoolers. Brightly colored murals depicting friendly animals adorned the walls, and the rooms were divided into designated areas for play, reading, and eating. The scent of Play-Doh and apple juice hung in the air, a constant reminder of the controlled, yet wonderfully messy, chaos that defined Clara's days. Outside, a sprawling, fenced-in garden offered swings, a sandbox, and a miniature climbing frame, providing ample opportunity for outdoor adventures, even on days like today, when a thin veil of drizzle threatened to dampen spirits, but not, Clara hoped, *her* spirit.
