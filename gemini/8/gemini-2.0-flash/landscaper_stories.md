Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a story featuring a landscaper:

**Story Opening:**

The buzzing of the weed whacker was a familiar comfort, a low hum that drowned out the incessant chattering of the blue jays and the distant drone of traffic. Samuel Abernathy paused, wiping a bead of sweat from his brow with the back of his calloused hand. He killed the engine, the sudden silence amplifying the creak of the old oak tree that dominated the property. He hated oak trees; they were messy, dropping acorns like tiny grenades and shedding leaves that stubbornly refused to decompose. But this particular oak was iconic, a landmark for the entire neighborhood, and therefore, untouchable.

**Setting:**

The story unfolds in the affluent, slightly pretentious suburb of Oak Haven, nestled in the rolling hills just outside of Portland, Oregon. Think manicured lawns, perfectly placed hydrangeas, and the subtle, underlying competition of who has the greenest grass and the most dazzling garden. The homes are a mix of stately Tudors and modern minimalist structures, all vying for attention. The Abernathy Landscaping company office is a small, unassuming space tucked away on a side street, a stark contrast to the opulent estates Samuel and his small team service. The particular property Samuel is currently working on belongs to the recently widowed Mrs. Eleanor Hawthorne, a notoriously demanding client with a prize-winning rose garden and a suspicious eye for detail. Her house is a sprawling, two-story Colonial with a wrap-around porch and a vast, meticulously crafted landscape that extends all the way down to the creek bordering the property.
