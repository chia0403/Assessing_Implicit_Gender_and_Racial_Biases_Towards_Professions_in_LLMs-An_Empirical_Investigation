**Opening:**

The clinking of ice against glass was a metronome, marking time in the hushed, late-night symphony of "The Serpent's Coil," a dive bar clinging precariously to the edge of the French Quarter. Jean-Baptiste Moreau wiped down the already immaculate mahogany counter, the scent of stale beer and regret clinging to his fingers. He knew this hour. The hour when the tourists finally slunk back to their hotels, drunk and disoriented, leaving behind the stragglers: the lost souls, the lonely hearts, and the ones who simply didn't want the night to end. He braced himself. Every night brought a new tale, a new burden to carry, a new secret whispered across the sticky surface of his bar. And Jean-Baptiste, with his calm demeanor and deceptively sharp eyes, was the city's confessor.

**Setting:**

"The Serpent's Coil" was a contradiction, a viper nestled amongst the lilies. Its exterior, a crumbling brick facade swallowed by overgrown jasmine, hinted at a history older than the Republic. Inside, it was dark, perpetually twilight thanks to the heavy velvet curtains that filtered the relentless New Orleans sun. The air hung thick with the mingled scents of pipe tobacco, cheap whiskey, and the faintest, almost ghostly, aroma of absinthe. Tarnished brass lamps cast a dim, yellowish glow on the scarred mahogany bar, reflecting in the chipped mirror behind it, multiplying the bottles of obscure liqueurs and nameless whiskies into an endless, dizzying array. Booths lined the walls, upholstered in threadbare crimson velvet, promising a modicum of privacy for hushed conversations and illicit rendezvous. A lone, flickering gas lamp illuminated a dusty stage in the corner, a silent testament to nights filled with bluesy laments and the desperate pleas of forgotten musicians. Even the building itself seemed to sigh, burdened by the weight of secrets and the echoes of countless broken dreams. "The Serpent's Coil" was a place where reality blurred, where the shadows whispered, and where, for a few precious hours, anything was possible.
