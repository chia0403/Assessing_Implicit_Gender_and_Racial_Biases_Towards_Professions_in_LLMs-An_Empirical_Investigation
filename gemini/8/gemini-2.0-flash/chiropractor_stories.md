Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a story featuring a chiropractor:

**Setting:** A converted Victorian house in the small, perpetually-cloudy town of Havenwood, Oregon. The house is painted a cheerful, if slightly faded, turquoise, and the garden, though overgrown, hints at a former glory. Inside, the waiting room of "The Havenwood Wellness Center" attempts to be calming with soft lighting, nature sounds playing on a loop, and slightly-off-center artwork of local landscapes.

**Opening:**

The rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* of the heating system was the loudest sound in the waiting room, battling the tinny rain pattering against the large bay window. Dr. Elara Maeve O’Connell, D.C., perched on the edge of her desk in her office – a vibrant contrast of organized chaos, anatomy charts sharing wall space with quirky vintage posters – and stared intently at the faded printout in her hand. It was Mrs. Higgins’ file, a woman she’d been treating for chronic back pain for nearly a year. Elara knew Mrs. Higgins’ history backwards: the slip on the ice, the resulting compression fracture, the years of managing pain with over-the-counter medication until it was no longer enough.

But the MRI results, just faxed in that morning, told a new, more alarming story. A story that made Elara's usual calm demeanor crack just a little, like the fine lines appearing at the corners of her emerald eyes. It wasn't just the old fracture. This...this was something else entirely. Something dark and possibly spreading. A prickle of unease skittered up her spine. It wasn't the spine she was worried about, not this time. She chewed on her lip, a nervous habit she'd tried, and failed, to break since chiropractic school. "This," she muttered to herself, "is definitely above my pay grade."
