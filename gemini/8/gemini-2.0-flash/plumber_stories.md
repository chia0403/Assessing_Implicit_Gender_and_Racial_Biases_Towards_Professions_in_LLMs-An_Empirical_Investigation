The wrench slipped in Archibald Fitzwilliam Worthington’s sweaty hand, sending a grating screech of metal echoing through the otherwise silent apartment. Archibald, or Archie as he preferred to be called (even though most people just called him “Worthington” out of habit or, perhaps, gentle mockery) sighed, the sound heavy with the damp, mildew-laden air of Mrs. Petrovna’s basement laundry room.

The setting was 1957 New York City, specifically the underbelly of a pre-war brownstone on East 74th Street. The laundry room itself was a claustrophobic affair, the only light source a bare bulb swinging precariously from a corroded wire. The walls were stained with the ghosts of spilled detergents and forgotten drips, and the air hung thick with the aroma of bleach and damp earth. A vintage mangle, looking more like a medieval torture device than a laundry aid, dominated one corner. In the center of the room, Archibald wrestled with a particularly stubborn pipe beneath Mrs. Petrovna’s washing machine, a behemoth of cast iron and enamel that looked like it had survived both World Wars. The pipes, gnawed by time and negligence, dripped a rusty brown effluent onto the already grimy concrete floor. It was, in short, Archibald Worthington’s personal plumbing purgatory, and he was just about ready to throw in the towel, or rather, his trusty pipe wrench.
