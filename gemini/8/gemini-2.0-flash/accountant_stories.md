The fluorescent lights of Kruger, Schmidt & Finch buzzed with a maddening consistency, a sonic metronome marking the slow, agonizing march toward 5:00 PM. For Archibald Leopold Finch, or Archie as he was begrudgingly known around the office, this was the most excruciating time of the day. He was hunched over a sprawling spreadsheet, the blue light of his monitor reflecting in the thick lenses of his glasses, blurring the already overwhelming rows of numbers.

Archie was a creature of habit, a man who found solace in the rigid order of debits and credits. He was, above all else, an accountant. And a damn good one, if he did say so himself. He thrived in the world of tax returns, balance sheets, and quarterly reports. He understood the language of profit and loss, a language that, unlike the chattering of his colleagues, made perfect sense.

The office itself, located on the 17th floor of the "Financial Solutions" building in downtown Chicago, was a monument to corporate blandness. Beige cubicles stretched as far as the eye could see, punctuated only by the occasional sad-looking potted plant or motivational poster. The air was thick with the smell of lukewarm coffee and quiet desperation. Outside, the city skyline peeked through the grime-coated windows, a constant reminder of the exciting, chaotic world Archie had carefully barricaded himself against. He preferred the predictable rhythm of his desk, his accounts, his life. Or at least, he thought he did, until the call came.
