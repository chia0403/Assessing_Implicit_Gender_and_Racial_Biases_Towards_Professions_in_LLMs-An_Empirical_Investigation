## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The flickering fluorescent lights of the Visitation Room at Blackwood Penitentiary hummed a discordant tune, a constant drone that seemed to amplify the tension in the air. The room itself was small, sterile, and deliberately unwelcoming. A thick pane of bulletproof glass separated the visitor's side from the inmate's, allowing for only strained visual contact through a crackling intercom system. The walls were painted a depressing shade of institutional green, chipped in places where frustrated fists had met them in the past.

**Opening:**

Dr. Eleanor Vance adjusted her glasses, a nervous habit she hadn't managed to shake even after fifteen years in the field. Across the glass, a man sat rigidly, his eyes, the color of chipped flint, fixed on some unseen point beyond her. His orange jumpsuit, stark against his pale skin, seemed to leach the life from his face, making him appear even more skeletal than he already was.

"Mr. Silas Thorne," Eleanor began, her voice carefully neutral, projecting across the static. "I understand you're aware of the purpose of my visit."

Silas Thorne didn't react. He remained silent, his thin lips a tight, unyielding line. Eleanor knew this would be difficult. Silas Thorne was a master of control, a man who had built a fortress of silence around his mind, protecting the secrets within. He was a challenge, a puzzle she needed to solve if she was to help the prosecution understand the darkness that had driven him to commit the unspeakable.

"I'm Dr. Eleanor Vance," she continued, emphasizing her credentials. "I'm a forensic psychologist, and I'm here to conduct a psychological evaluation."

Still no response. Just the unwavering, unsettling gaze. Eleanor took a deep breath. This was going to be a long day. A very long day. And she had a feeling that, behind that cold, impassive facade, Silas Thorne was waiting for her to make the first wrong move.
