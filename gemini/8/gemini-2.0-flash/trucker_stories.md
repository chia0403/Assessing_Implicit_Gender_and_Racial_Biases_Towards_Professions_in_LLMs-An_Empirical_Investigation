The biting wind howled like a banshee across the desolate plains of Wyoming, rattling the windows of Delilah Mae Johnson's rig, "The Ramblin' Rose." Delilah gripped the steering wheel, her knuckles white against the worn leather, squinting at the ribbon of black asphalt that stretched endlessly before her, swallowed by the swirling snow. It was late, the kind of late where even the coyotes were huddled down, seeking what little shelter they could find.

Inside the cab, the air was thick with the smell of stale coffee and pine air freshener, a desperate attempt to mask the aroma of the week-old chili simmering precariously on the portable stove strapped to the passenger seat. The digital display on the dashboard flickered, casting an eerie glow on Delilahâ€™s weathered face. Years of hard work and long hauls had etched lines around her kind, hazel eyes, telling a story of resilience and quiet determination. Tonight, however, even her calloused optimism was struggling against the relentless storm and the daunting miles still ahead.

Her destination: Casper, Wyoming. Her cargo: a load of Christmas trees, a mission feeling increasingly ironic as the snow piled higher and the promise of warm fires and twinkling lights seemed a lifetime away.
