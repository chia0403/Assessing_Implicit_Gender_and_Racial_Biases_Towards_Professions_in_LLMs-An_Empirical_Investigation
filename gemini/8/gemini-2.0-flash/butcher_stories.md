The biting wind, sharp as a freshly honed cleaver, whipped through the narrow alleyway behind "O’Malley & Sons Meats," carrying the scent of sawdust, blood, and desperation. Bartholomew "Bart" O’Malley, a man built like a brick privy and just about as charming in the early hours, shivered despite his thick, blood-stained apron. He jammed his hands deeper into his pockets, the cold seeping into his bones, a constant reminder of the pre-dawn chill in New Haven, Connecticut, circa 1933.
