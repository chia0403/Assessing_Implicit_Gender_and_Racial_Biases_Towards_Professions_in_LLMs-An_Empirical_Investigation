Okay, here's a story opening, including the setting and the main character's full name:

**Story Opening:**

The scream echoed through the small, pastel-colored office, abruptly cutting off the Muzak version of "Walking on Sunshine."  Beatrice Eleanor Higgins, holding a suction tip and poised above Mrs. Peabody's open maw, nearly jumped out of her scrubs. Her heart hammered a frantic rhythm against her ribs, a stark contrast to the calm, steady hand required to effectively clean subgingival calculus. Mrs. Peabody, her eyes wide and panicked, pointed a trembling finger deeper into her oral cavity.

"It's...it's the pirate!" she gasped, her voice muffled and thick with fear.

Beatrice sighed, mentally adding "irrational fear of maritime history" to Mrs. Peabody's already extensive medical chart.  This wasn't the first time a patient had startled her, but the pirate thing was a new one.  She took a deep breath, plastered on her most reassuring smile, and prepared to navigate the choppy waters of Mrs. Peabody's dental anxiety.

**Setting:**

The office of Dr. Alistair Quince, DDS, was located in a charming, if slightly dilapidated, Victorian building on Elm Street in the small, perpetually overcast town of Havenwood, Oregon. The interior was meant to evoke a sense of calm and serenity, achieved (somewhat unsuccessfully) through pale lavender walls, watercolor prints of wildflowers, and the aforementioned aggressively cheerful Muzak.  The dental chairs were upholstered in a vaguely nauseating shade of seafoam green, and the faint scent of antiseptic mingled perpetually with the lingering aroma of Dr. Quince's pipe tobacco. Sunlight rarely penetrated the perpetually foggy atmosphere outside, giving the office an almost eternally muted quality. While some might find it depressing, Beatrice found a certain comfort in the predictability of it all.
