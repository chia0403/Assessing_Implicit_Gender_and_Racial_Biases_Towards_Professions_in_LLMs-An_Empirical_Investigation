Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a guard named with a full name:

**Story Opening & Setting:**

The humid air hung thick and heavy, smelling of petrichor and something faintly metallic – the rust from the iron gates of Fort Obsidian, no doubt. Sergeant Darius Thorne, his back aching in protest, shifted his weight against the rough-hewn stone of the watchtower.  He’d been on duty since dusk, and the relentless drone of cicadas had burrowed its way deep into his skull.  His uniform, perpetually damp with sweat, clung to him like a second, less-forgiving skin.

Below, the moon, a chipped sickle in the inky sky, cast long, dancing shadows across the courtyard.  The only other sounds were the rhythmic snorts of the stable horses and the occasional creak of the old wooden drawbridge.  Fort Obsidian was not known for excitement. It was a remote outpost, a forgotten cog in the vast, creaking machine of the Kingdom of Eldoria, and more often than not, its primary purpose seemed to be keeping the local spiders employed.  Darius had spent the last five years staring at the same crumbling battlements, the same overgrown moat, the same stubbornly persistent patch of weeds that refused to die in the courtyard, no matter how many times he pulled them.  Five years of boredom, punctuated only by the occasional supply caravan or the even rarer visit from a bored noble passing through.  He'd started to believe that the legendary Goblin raids his grandfather used to tell him about were just that: legends.  

Tonight, however, felt different. The air crackled with an almost palpable tension. A silence, deeper than the usual rural quiet, had settled over the forest beyond the fort walls. Even the cicadas seemed subdued. And Darius, a man not usually prone to flights of fancy, felt a prickle of unease crawling up his spine. He tightened his grip on the hilt of his sword, his senses on high alert.  Something was coming.  And he had a sinking feeling it wouldn't be pleasant.
