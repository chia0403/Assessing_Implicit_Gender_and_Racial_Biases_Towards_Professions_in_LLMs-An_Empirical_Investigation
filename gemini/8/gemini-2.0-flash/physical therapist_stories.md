## Story Opening and Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The scent of stale disinfectant and liniment hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Dr. Amelia Grace Harding. She winced, adjusting the mask perched on her nose, and squeezed a dollop of hand sanitizer onto her gloved palms. It was 7:58 AM. Just two minutes until Mrs. Petrovich and her chronic lower back pain arrived, and Amelia desperately needed another shot of lukewarm coffee to face the day. Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the poorly insulated windows of the clinic. Amelia knew that sound well; it was the sound of another gloomy Seattle morning, perfectly mirroring the ache in her own soul. She took a deep breath, squared her shoulders, and reminded herself why she was here: to help. Even if it meant facing another avalanche of complaints about aches, pains, and the exorbitant cost of co-pays.

**Setting:**

The story is set in "Rehabilitate Northwest," a small, independent physical therapy clinic located in the Ballard neighborhood of Seattle, Washington. The clinic itself is housed in a renovated brick building, originally a maritime supply store. While the exterior retains some of its rustic charm, the interior is a mix of modern and dated elements. The reception area is sparsely furnished with uncomfortable vinyl chairs and a stack of outdated magazines. Beyond the reception desk, the treatment area is divided into smaller, semi-private cubicles with thin, sound-dampening partitions. Each cubicle contains a treatment table, a small selection of resistance bands and weights, and a portable heater that rarely works. A larger, more open area in the back houses specialized equipment like a treadmill, stationary bike, and parallel bars, all showing signs of heavy use and a tight budget. The overall atmosphere is functional but somewhat sterile, a constant reminder of the medical nature of the space. The Pacific Northwest weather, particularly the constant rain and gray skies, often plays a significant role in the story, mirroring the characters' internal struggles and adding to the overall mood.
