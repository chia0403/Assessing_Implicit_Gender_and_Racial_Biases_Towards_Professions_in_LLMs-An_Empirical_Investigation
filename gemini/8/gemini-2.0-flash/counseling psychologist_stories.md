## Story Opening:

The stale coffee threatened to spill as Dr. Eleanor Mallory slammed her travel mug onto her desk, the sound echoing in the surprisingly empty waiting room. Outside, the relentless Seattle rain hammered against the floor-to-ceiling windows of her office on the 32nd floor of the Rainier Tower, turning the already gray city into a blurry watercolour. She'd been staring at the same damn intake form for the last ten minutes, trying to conjure up a spark ofâ€¦ something. Interest? Empathy? Anything other than the dull throb of exhaustion pressing behind her eyes.

The form belonged to a Mrs. Agnes Finch, referred by her primary care physician for "acute anxiety and possible hoarding tendencies." Another day, another mountain of emotional baggage for Eleanor to unpack. Usually, she relished the challenge. Usually, she found some grain of hope, some flicker of resilience, even in the most fractured psyches. But today, the prospect felt more like slogging through quicksand.

She glanced at the clock. 9:57 AM. Three minutes until Mrs. Finch was due. Eleanor sighed, a sound swallowed by the white noise of the storm. She pushed the intake form aside, her gaze drifting out to the Space Needle, a hazy silhouette against the turbulent sky. She wondered if even that iconic symbol of hope felt as weighed down as she did in this perpetual Seattle gloom. This was her city, her sanctuary, but lately, even the rain felt like a personal attack.

## Setting:

Dr. Eleanor Mallory's office, "Mindful Connections," is located on the 32nd floor of the Rainier Tower in downtown Seattle. The building itself is a modern architectural marvel, its unique "tulip" shape giving the office panoramic views of the city.

**Inside the office:** The decor is designed to be calming and welcoming. Soft gray and muted blue tones dominate the color palette. The waiting room is minimalist, with comfortable armchairs, low lighting, and a small, bubbling water feature that attempts to mask the city's cacophony. Abstract art, chosen for its soothing qualities, adorns the walls.

**Eleanor's consulting room:** This room is more personal. Shelves lined with psychology textbooks and framed degrees sit behind her desk. A comfortable, overstuffed armchair faces her desk, offering a less formal setting for her clients. A collection of small, hand-picked objects - a smooth river stone, a dried lavender sprig, a miniature Buddha statue - are arranged on her desk, offering tactile and visual points of focus for anxious clients. A small window box overflowing with vibrant, resilient succulents sits on the windowsill, a testament to Eleanor's belief in the power of growth even in challenging environments. The overall feeling is one of quiet professionalism, a safe space where vulnerabilities can be explored and healing can begin.
