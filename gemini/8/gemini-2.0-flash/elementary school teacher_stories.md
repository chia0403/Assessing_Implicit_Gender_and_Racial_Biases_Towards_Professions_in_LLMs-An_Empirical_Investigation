The scent of stale crayons, dried glue, and overripe bananas clung to Mrs. Eleanor Abigail Hawthorne's classroom like a persistent, well-meaning ghost. It was 7:15 AM, and the pre-dawn light filtering through the dusty windows of room 3B at Meadowbrook Elementary School painted the room in shades of grey. Eleanor, or Miss Hawthorne as she was fiercely referred to by her third graders, already had the coffee pot gurgling merrily in the corner, its aroma a sharp contrast to the pervasive fruit-and-art-supply musk. She surveyed her domain, a carefully orchestrated explosion of colorful posters, student artwork haphazardly taped to every available surface, and the looming, slightly menacing skeleton named Bartholomew, who was currently sporting a construction paper Santa hat. Meadowbrook Elementary, a brick building worn smooth by generations of sticky fingers and echoed with the joyous screams of countless recesses, nestled in the sleepy, predominantly residential town of Willow Creek, Ohio. The town, famous mostly for its annual pumpkin festival and the unnervingly synchronized waving of its elderly residents, held a certain quiet charm that Eleanor had grown to appreciate over her seven years of teaching. But this morning, the familiar comfort felt a little thinner, a little less reassuring. Today was Picture Day, a chaotic carnival of forced smiles, misplaced hair bows, and the looming threat of rogue spaghetti stains.
