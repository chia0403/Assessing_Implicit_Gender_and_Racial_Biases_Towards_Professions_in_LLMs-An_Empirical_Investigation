## Story Opening:

The static crackled and hissed like a thousand angry cats, the usual soundtrack to Evelyn Mae Harding’s life. She sighed, pushing a stray wisp of greying auburn hair from her forehead with the back of a grease-stained hand. It was a Tuesday, and Tuesday meant trouble, at least according to her internal radio-engineer weather report. Tuesdays were always when the gremlins crawled into the broadcast equipment at KBRX, the tiny, perpetually underfunded radio station serving the equally tiny town of Harmony Creek, Nebraska.

Today's gremlin seemed to be particularly tenacious. Evelyn had been chasing it for the past three hours, tracing faulty wiring, testing tubes with her ancient Hickok 539B tube tester, and muttering increasingly inventive curses under her breath. The music she was supposed to be broadcasting – a relentlessly upbeat polka tune – was now a mangled symphony of distortion and dead air.

## Setting:

KBRX was a relic, a forgotten corner of broadcasting history housed in a converted Quonset hut on the outskirts of Harmony Creek. The paint, once a vibrant sunshine yellow, was now peeling and faded, giving the building a perpetually mournful expression. The interior was even worse. Wires snaked across the floor like metallic vines, competing for space with discarded coffee cups, half-eaten donuts, and the accumulated detritus of decades of broadcast operation.

Evelyn's "office" was essentially a narrow alcove crammed with oscilloscopes, multimeters, and a dizzying array of tools that would have made a seasoned electrician weep. A single, bare bulb cast a harsh, unforgiving light over the chaotic scene. A hand-drawn sign, taped to the wall above her workbench, read: "If it ain't broke, I haven't gotten to it yet." Underneath that, another sign in smaller print: "Please leave me alone unless something is actively on fire."
