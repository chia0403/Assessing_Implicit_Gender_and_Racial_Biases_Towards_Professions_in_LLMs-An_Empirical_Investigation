The stale, metallic tang of city grit coated Amelia Hayes' tongue as she squinted at the flashing neon sign of the Golden Gate Diner. Rain, a relentless curtain of shimmering gray, lashed against her trench coat, soaking through despite the hurried sprint from the bus stop. It was the kind of rain that seeped into your bones and reminded you of every bad decision you'd ever made, every story left untold, every lead that went cold.

The Golden Gate Diner, perched on the edge of San Francisco's Tenderloin district, was a bastion of late-night gristle and greasy spoons. Inside, the air hung thick with the aroma of stale coffee, cheap bacon, and desperation. The vinyl booths, ripped and patched with duct tape, were occupied by a cast of characters ripped straight from a Raymond Chandler novel: lonely truckers, weary prostitutes, and men with eyes that held secrets darker than the alleyways outside. Amelia knew this place. She’d spent countless nights here, nursing lukewarm coffee and waiting for a tip, a rumour, a sliver of truth to break through the city's carefully constructed façade.

Amelia Hayes, investigative reporter for the *San Francisco Chronicle*, was on the hunt. Not for a big expose, not tonight. Tonight, she was chasing a ghost: a name whispered in hushed tones, a file gone missing, a conspiracy buried deep beneath the city's glittering veneer. Tonight, she was hunting down Vincent Costello, and she had a sinking feeling he was somewhere inside this greasy spoon.
