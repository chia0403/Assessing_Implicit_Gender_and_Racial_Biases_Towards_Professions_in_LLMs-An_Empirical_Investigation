The fluorescent lights of the Peterson Institute of Astronomical Research hummed, a low, constant drone that permeated every corner of the cavernous lobby. Dust motes, disturbed by the industrial-sized air conditioning vents, danced in the artificial sunlight, looking almost like tiny galaxies of their own. Outside, the Arizona desert pressed in, a silent, unforgiving expanse.

This was Hector Ramirezâ€™s domain. He knew every tile crack in the polished floor, every scuff on the brushed steel elevator doors, every fingerprint on the massive picture window that offered a tantalizing, but ultimately uninspiring, view of the car park. For Hector Ramirez, janitor extraordinaire, the pre-dawn shift at the Peterson Institute was less a job and more a ritual. He arrived before the scientists, before the administrators, before even the security guard brewing his first pot of coffee. He preferred it that way. Solitude allowed him to lose himself in the rhythmic swish of the mop, the hiss of the vacuum cleaner, the gentle chemical scent of disinfectant.

Tonight, however, the quiet had been shattered. An emergency call had dragged him in an hour early. And as he pushed his cleaning cart past the reception desk, he saw it: a chaotic tableau of upturned chairs, scattered paperwork, and a lingering scent of burnt coffee so strong it masked even the industrial-strength lemon scent of his floor cleaner. Something was definitely not right.
