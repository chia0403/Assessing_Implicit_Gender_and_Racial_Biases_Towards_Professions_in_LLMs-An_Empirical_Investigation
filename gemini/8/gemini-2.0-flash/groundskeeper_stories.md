The morning dew clung to the manicured lawns of Blackwood Manor like a forgotten lover's tears. It sparkled under the weak, pre-dawn sun, momentarily transforming the ordinary blades of grass into a field of diamonds. This was the hour that Alistair Finch, Grounds Keeper First Class, preferred. The silence, punctuated only by the chirping of early birds, allowed him to appreciate the artistry of his labor, the precise lines of the flowerbeds, the sculpted symmetry of the hedges.

Blackwood Manor itself loomed in the distance, a gothic behemoth of dark stone and shadowed gargoyles. It had been built in the late 1800s by a shipping magnate with more money than sense and a penchant for the dramatic. Alistair knew every inch of the sprawling estate, from the whispering willow trees guarding the south pond to the crumbling stone cherubs hidden amongst the rose bushes in the walled garden. Heâ€™d been tending it for fifteen years now, a task both challenging and strangely comforting.

Alistair inhaled the crisp air, a blend of damp earth, freshly cut grass, and the faint, almost metallic tang of the river that bordered the property. He tightened his grip on his trusty hedge trimmers, the hum of their motor about to break the tranquility. Today, it was the East Wing hedges that needed attention, and Alistair Finch, Grounds Keeper First Class, was nothing if not meticulous. He just hoped Mrs. Blackwood didn't decide to inspect his work this morning. Her withering pronouncements and perpetually raised eyebrow were enough to wilt even the hardiest of perennials.
