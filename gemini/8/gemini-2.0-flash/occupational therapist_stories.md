## Story Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

The scent of lavender and despair hung heavy in the air, a peculiar cocktail familiar to Dr. Eleanor Grace Hawthorne. She adjusted her glasses, the frames pressing a little too snugly against the bridge of her nose, and surveyed the scene. A half-finished jigsaw puzzle depicting a pastoral landscape lay abandoned on the worn, floral-patterned table. Mrs. Gable, a woman who usually greeted Eleanor with a torrent of colourful, albeit often repetitive, stories, sat slumped in her armchair, her gaze fixed on some unseen tragedy etched into the faded wallpaper. Today, the spark had gone out.

**Setting:**

The story unfolds primarily within the confines of *The Golden Years Assisted Living Facility* in the quiet, coastal town of Seabrook, Maine. The building itself is a sprawling, two-story structure built in the early 1970s, attempting to blend modern functionality with a semblance of New England charm. Imagine beige siding, trimmed with a peeling, slightly chipped, faux-colonial white. A small, manicured lawn stretches before the entrance, punctuated by a couple of gnarled apple trees that offer shade in the summer and a melancholic air of bare branches in the winter.

Inside, the air is perpetually warm and slightly humid, a constant battle against the harsh Maine weather. The hallways are lined with faded photographs of past residents, snapshots of younger, brighter selves. Each room is personalized with varying degrees of enthusiasm â€“ some meticulously decorated with family photos, crocheted blankets, and well-loved books, while others remain sparsely furnished, reflecting a life either winding down or stubbornly refusing to be defined by its current limitations.

Eleanor's office, a small space tucked away near the dining hall, is a haven of organized chaos. Stacks of charts fight for space with colorful stress balls, sensory toys, and a small ceramic frog she bought at a craft fair, hoping its whimsical charm would ease the tension of her daily work. The walls are covered in anatomical charts, motivational posters, and artwork created by her patients, a testament to her dedication and the small victories achieved within those four walls. The overall impression is one of gentle hope clinging to the edges of a building steeped in the realities of aging and loss.
