## The Story Opening:

The humid Mississippi air hung heavy with the scent of magnolias and something else, something metallic and acrid that pricked Dr. Eleanor Maeve Dubois' nostrils. She squinted, pushing her thick-rimmed glasses higher on her nose. The early morning sun, even filtered through the Spanish moss draping the ancient oaks, felt like a physical weight. She'd been up all night, delivering twins at the Charity Hospital on the edge of New Orleans, and her scrubs felt damp and clinging. Now, here she was, summoned to Oak Haven Plantation by a frantic phone call and the promise of a "situation requiring immediate medical attention."

The "situation," as it turned out, was sprawled face down on the manicured lawn, surrounded by a gaggle of hysterically weeping women in gauzy white dresses and a pair of grim-faced men who looked like they'd rather be anywhere else. Eleanor knelt, her medical bag bumping against her hip, and touched the man's neck. No pulse. The metallic smell, she realized with a sinking feeling, wasn't just in the air. It was coming from the crimson stain blooming on the pristine white shirt stretched taut across the man's back.

## The Setting:

**Oak Haven Plantation, Louisiana, 1928.** A sprawling antebellum estate, its white columns gleaming like teeth under the Southern sun. The main house, a testament to a bygone era of wealth and opulence, sits perched atop a gentle rise overlooking acres of meticulously maintained gardens. Ancient oak trees, their branches draped with Spanish moss, cast long, dappled shadows across the lawn. The air is thick with humidity and the scent of magnolias, jasmine, and decay. While the plantation still boasts a veneer of grandeur, a closer look reveals signs of neglect: peeling paint, overgrown flowerbeds, and a general atmosphere of quiet desperation. The remnants of the old South cling fiercely to this place, even as the modern world encroaches, bringing with it new ways of life and unsettling secrets. The shadows of the past run deep here, as dark and tangled as the roots of the ancient oaks themselves.
