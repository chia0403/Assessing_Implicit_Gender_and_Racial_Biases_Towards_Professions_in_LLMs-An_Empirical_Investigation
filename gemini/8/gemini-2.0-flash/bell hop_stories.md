## Story Opening:

The brass nameplate, polished to a blinding sheen under the lobby's opulent chandelier, proclaimed "The Grand Meridian Hotel." Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of lilies, old money, and whispered secrets. And just inside the revolving doors, a blur of scarlet and gold, stood Bertram Bartholomew Butterfield, Bellhop extraordinaire. He adjusted his cap, a nervous tic he’d developed on his first day, and watched a gaggle of impeccably dressed women with matching poodles mince towards the reception desk. This was it. The start of the Saturday socialite rush, the busiest day of the week at The Grand Meridian, and the day Bertram hoped to finally catch the eye of Miss Penelope Plumtree, the hotel’s resident florist, who possessed a smile as bright as a summer marigold and a way of handling thorny rose bushes that Bertram found absolutely captivating. If only he could just avoid tripping over his own feet, spilling luggage, or, God forbid, getting assigned to the infamous "Mr. Henderson" on the 13th floor. Today, Bertram Bartholomew Butterfield was determined to be more than just a bellhop. Today, he was a smooth operator, a purveyor of impeccable service, and hopefully, a suitor worth noticing.

## Setting:

**The Grand Meridian Hotel:** A sprawling, Beaux-Arts masterpiece nestled in the heart of the prestigious Upper East Side of Manhattan. Built in the 1920s, the hotel exudes an air of old-world glamour and hushed elegance. Think crystal chandeliers, marble floors that echo with every footstep, and plush velvet seating arranged in strategically-placed nooks perfect for discreet conversations. The lobby is a whirlwind of activity, a constant stream of well-heeled guests, impeccably dressed staff, and the occasional celebrity seeking refuge from the paparazzi. The air is thick with the scent of expensive perfume, freshly brewed coffee from the hotel’s renowned cafe, and the subtle, underlying aroma of wealth. The hotel boasts several restaurants, a rooftop bar with breathtaking views of the city, a state-of-the-art spa, and enough winding corridors to get even the most seasoned guest lost. Beyond the lobby, a silent army of staff keeps the hotel running smoothly, from the crisp white linens to the perfectly arranged floral displays (courtesy of Miss Plumtree). The Grand Meridian is not just a hotel; it’s an institution, a symbol of luxury and exclusivity, and a stage where Bertram Bartholomew Butterfield hopes to finally make his mark.
