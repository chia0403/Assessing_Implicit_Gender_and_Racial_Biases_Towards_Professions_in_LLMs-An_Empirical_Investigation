Okay, here's a story opening and setting, including the full name of the main character, who is an interior decorator:

**Story Opening:**

The scent of lavender and old money hung thick in the air, a familiar perfume that always clung to Penelope Ainsworth's cashmere scarf after a consultation in Beacon Hill. She smoothed the fabric, the gesture more habit than necessity, as she stepped out of the meticulously restored brownstone. Inside, Mrs. Van Derlyn, a woman whose jewelry could finance a small nation, was agonizing over the exact shade of celadon for her drawing room. Penelope, of course, had just the swatch, hand-dyed silk from a small workshop in Florence. It was details, Penelope knew, that separated the merely wealthy from the truly elegant.

But as she hailed a cab on Charles Street, her thoughts weren’t on silk or shades of green. They were on the jarring email that had pinged into her inbox just before her meeting – a frantic plea from her estranged sister, a sister Penelope hadn't spoken to in almost five years. The subject line was simply: "Rose Cottage. Help."

**Setting:**

The story is primarily set in **Boston, Massachusetts**, focusing initially on the upscale neighborhoods like **Beacon Hill** where Penelope's interior design business, "Ainsworth Interiors," thrives.

**Rose Cottage**, mentioned in the email, is in a stark contrast to Penelope's usual clientele. It's located in the **rural, coastal town of Port Blossom, Maine**, a place Penelope remembers from childhood summers, filled with weathered clapboard houses, salty air, and a quieter, more rugged beauty than the polished perfection of Boston. Port Blossom is a town that has seen better days, its fishing industry declining and tourism becoming its main lifeline. Rose Cottage itself is a charming, but dilapidated, cottage overlooking the ocean, filled with faded floral wallpaper and the ghosts of family memories.
