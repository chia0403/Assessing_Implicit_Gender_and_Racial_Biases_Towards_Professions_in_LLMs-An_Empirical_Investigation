The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, stinging Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth's exposed cheeks as she hurried across the cobbled square. The scent of salt and brine, normally invigorating, was lost today beneath the metallic tang of impending snow. She clutched her leather medical bag tighter against her chest, its worn surface offering a sliver of warmth in the pre-dawn chill. The fishing town of Port Dunbrodie, normally bustling with the rhythmic clang of shipyards and the cries of gulls, was shrouded in a ghostly silence, broken only by the rhythmic creak of a lone fishing trawler bobbing restlessly in the harbor.

Eleanor was late. Not disastrously, but late enough to warrant a frown from Nurse Brodie, a woman whose disapproval could curdle milk. She quickened her pace, her sturdy boots echoing against the ancient stonework. The Dunbrodie Infirmary, a squat, grey building that looked more like a fortress than a place of healing, loomed ahead. It was a stark, unforgiving structure, much like the lives of the men and women who relied on it. Eleanor knew that better than anyone. This was her domain, her battleground, and this morning, she was already bracing herself for the storm to come, both inside and out.
