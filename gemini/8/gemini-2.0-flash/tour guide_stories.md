## The Story Opening:

The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of frangipani and diesel as Cordelia Mallory adjusted the brim of her Panama hat, squinting at the shimmering heat rising from the tarmac. A bead of sweat trickled down her spine, a sensation as familiar as the rustle of palm fronds in the ever-present Caribbean breeze. She chewed on the inside of her cheek, a nervous habit she hadn't been able to shake since her first tour group arrived, a decade and a thousand sunburned tourists ago. Today, however, the usual pre-tour jitters were amplified. The email from "Mr. Sterling" had been cryptic, mentioning "special interest" and "utmost discretion." Cordelia Mallory wasn't one for mysteries, especially when they threatened to disrupt her meticulously planned "Treasures of Tortuga" tour. She glanced at the clock tower in the sleepy capital of Port Royal, a landmark she pointed out with weary enthusiasm at least twice a week. 10:00 AM sharp. They should be arriving any minute. She just hoped these "special interest" tourists wouldn't require her to fabricate too many elaborate pirate tales, or worse, uncover any actual buried treasure. Cordelia preferred her history safely confined to textbooks and postcards.

## The Setting:

The story opens in the bustling, yet quaint, capital of Port Royal on the fictional Caribbean island of Tortuga. The scene unfolds on the bustling waterfront, specifically near the docks where cruise ships and ferries regularly disgorge their passengers. The architecture is a colourful blend of colonial Spanish and British styles, weathered by the relentless sun and sea spray. Buildings painted in vibrant hues of turquoise, ochre, and coral line the narrow, cobbled streets, interspersed with ramshackle wooden structures that seem to cling precariously to the hillside. The air is filled with a cacophony of sounds: the hawkers' calls advertising everything from handcrafted jewellery to rum punch, the reggae beats spilling from open-air cafes, and the constant hum of activity from the arriving and departing boats. The harbour itself is a vibrant tapestry of colourful fishing vessels, sleek yachts, and the imposing silhouettes of the cruise liners further out at sea. Lush tropical vegetation spills from every corner, softening the edges of the bustling town and hinting at the wilder, untamed interior of the island.
