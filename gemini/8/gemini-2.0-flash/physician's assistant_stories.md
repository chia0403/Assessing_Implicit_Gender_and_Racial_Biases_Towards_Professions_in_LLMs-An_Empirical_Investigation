## Opening:

The persistent, rhythmic beep of the cardiac monitor was a stark counterpoint to the gentle rhythm of the snow falling outside the clinic window. Amelia Rose Hayes, Physician’s Assistant, kneaded the bridge of her nose, trying to ward off the beginnings of a tension headache. It had been a long day at the clinic, and the weight of responsibility felt heavier tonight than usual. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, amplifying the fatigue buzzing beneath her skin.

“Amelia?” Dr. Petrov’s voice, laced with a familiar exhaustion, cut through the sterile silence. “Can you come take a look at Mrs. Davies’ chart? I’m not liking the protein levels.”

Amelia sighed, a silent, almost imperceptible puff of air. Duty called. She pushed back from her desk, the wheels of her chair squeaking a tiny protest against the linoleum floor, and headed toward the small consultation room at the end of the hall. The snow outside seemed to fall a little harder, a soft, white curtain drawn against the harsh realities inside.

## Setting:

**Dr. Petrov’s Family Clinic**, nestled in the small, rural town of Havenwood, Montana, was a building born of necessity rather than aesthetics. A sprawling, single-story structure built in the 1970s, it was practical but undeniably dated. The exterior was a faded brick, softened by climbing ivy in the summer months (now just bare, skeletal tendrils clinging to the brick in the winter's grip).

Inside, the waiting room was a symphony of beige and muted blues, the walls adorned with generic landscape paintings that had probably hung there since the clinic's opening. Comfortable, but worn, armchairs lined the walls, usually occupied by a mix of ranchers, farmers, and the town's elderly population.

The hallways were narrow and smelled faintly of antiseptic and old coffee. Examination rooms were small and functional, each equipped with a standard examination table, a rolling metal cart holding various medical instruments, and a framed anatomy chart. Dr. Petrov's office, a slightly larger version of the examination rooms, was cluttered with stacks of medical journals and patient files.

Havenwood itself was a town clinging to tradition. Surrounded by rolling hills and vast, open fields, its main industry was agriculture. It was a tight-knit community, where everyone knew everyone else's business, and secrets were a rare commodity. The harsh winters and isolation fostered a resilience in its inhabitants, but also a certain distrust of outsiders.
