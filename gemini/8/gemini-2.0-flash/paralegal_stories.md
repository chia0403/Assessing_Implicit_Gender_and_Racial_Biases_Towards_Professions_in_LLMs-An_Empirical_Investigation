## The Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The fluorescent lights of the 27th floor of the Beaumont & Finch law firm hummed a monotonous tune above Amelia Hayes' head. It was 7:48 PM, and the city of Chicago, a glittering tapestry of car headlights and building lights, stretched out beyond the panoramic window beside her desk. The air was thick with the scent of stale coffee and impending deadlines, a familiar perfume in the after-hours warren of the Beaumont & Finch complex litigation department. Scattered across her desk like casualties of a legal battle were stacks of depositions, highlighted witness statements, and the ever-present, ominous bulk of the "Goliath Technologies Anti-Trust Suit" binder.

**Opening:**

Amelia Hayes, a paralegal with Beaumont & Finch, massaged the bridge of her nose, the ghost of a headache throbbing behind her eyes. The coffee hadn’t helped, nor had the lukewarm, hastily consumed slice of pizza from lunch. For the past three months, her life had revolved around Goliath Technologies and their alleged monopolistic practices, a soul-crushing dance of legal jargon and endless document review. She glanced at the blinking cursor on her laptop screen, a mocking reminder of the brief she needed to finish summarizing before tomorrow morning's partner meeting. Just one more witness statement, she thought, just one more. Then maybe, just maybe, she could escape this gilded cage and find solace in a glass of wine and a true crime podcast. But as she scrolled through the digital transcript, her eyes snagged on a single line, a throwaway comment made by a relatively minor executive named David Miller. It was a sentence that didn’t seem to fit, a discordant note in the otherwise harmonious symphony of corporate denial. It was a sentence that made Amelia Hayes' blood run cold. It read: "…and then we made sure the problem was permanently… addressed."
