**Opening:**

The rhythmic thrum of the heated stone against her palm was a meditative anchor in the chaos of her own thoughts. Evelyn Grace Blackwood, registered massage therapist, pressed the smooth basalt against the taut muscles of Mr. Henderson's shoulder, her mind a whir of unpaid bills and a leaky faucet she couldn't seem to fix. She knew she should be present, focusing on the nuances of his tissue, the knots that told the story of stress and sedentary living. But the weight of the city, the ever-present pressure to keep her small practice afloat, felt as heavy as the stones themselves. He sighed, a sound of deep, involuntary relief, and Evelyn forced a smile, hoping it reached her eyes. "Feeling a bit better, Mr. Henderson?"

**Setting:**

Evelyn's practice, "The Kneaded Soul," occupied a cozy, sun-drenched space on the third floor of a converted brownstone in the heart of Boston's South End. The walls were painted a calming sage green, adorned with framed prints of botanical illustrations and calming watercolors of New England landscapes. Soft, instrumental music, carefully curated to avoid anything too jarring or upbeat, trickled from hidden speakers. The air was thick with the soothing aromas of lavender and eucalyptus, punctuated by the subtle, earthy scent of the heated stones.

A small, antique reception desk, inherited from her grandmother, sat just inside the entrance, cluttered with appointment books and a vase of fresh-cut wildflowers (a weekly indulgence, despite her financial woes). Beyond the reception area was a comfortable waiting room with plush armchairs and a selection of wellness magazines. Further down the hallway were two treatment rooms, each meticulously arranged with heated massage tables, comfortable blankets, and adjustable lighting. The overall effect was one of tranquil sanctuary, a welcome escape from the bustling city streets just beyond its walls. However, behind the serene facade, Evelyn knew the true cost of maintaining this oasis, the constant struggle to keep it from crumbling under the weight of her mounting debts.
