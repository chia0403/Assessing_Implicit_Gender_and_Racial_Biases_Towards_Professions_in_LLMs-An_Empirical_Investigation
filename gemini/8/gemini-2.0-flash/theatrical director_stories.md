## Story Opening:

The stench of stale coffee and desperation clung to the air of the dimly lit Black Box Theater like a second skin. Bartholomew "Bart" Quill, artistic director and resident masochist, pinched the bridge of his nose, a familiar ache blossoming behind his eyes. The clock on the wall, a donation from some long-forgotten benefactor, ticked with the mocking insistence of a metronome gone mad. It was 2:17 AM, and the dress rehearsal for "The Tragedy of Barnaby Button," a play so avant-garde it made Samuel Beckett look like Disney, was going up in flames. Metaphorically, of course. Though, given the current trajectory of the production, Bart wouldn't entirely rule out a literal conflagration.

**Setting:**

The Black Box Theater, nestled in the forgotten alleyways of a semi-gentrified arts district in Chicago. Its peeling paint, mismatched furniture, and perpetually sticky floor testified to its long and storied history of housing theatrical dreams that mostly went bust. The building itself was a converted warehouse, its brick walls adorned with a haphazard collection of posters from past productions, each one a faded testament to the relentless optimism (and occasional delusion) that fueled the theater's existence. The stage was small and intimate, barely large enough to swing a particularly disgruntled cat, and the lighting rig, affectionately nicknamed "The Frankenstein," was a temperamental beast that required constant coaxing and prayer. The atmosphere, even on the best of days, was a potent blend of artistic angst and existential dread, a cocktail that Bartholomew Quill seemed to thrive on, or at least, tolerate with a world-weary sigh.
