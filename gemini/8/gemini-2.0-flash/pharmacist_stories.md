The bell above the door of "The Willow Creek Apothecary" jingled, its cheerful chime swallowed almost immediately by the oppressive silence that had become Eleanor Maeve Bellweather's constant companion. Eleanor, whose hair was pulled back in a severely practical bun that did little to soften the sharp angles of her face, didn't bother to look up from the prescription she was meticulously filling. It was likely just Mrs. Higgins again, wanting to complain about the price of her new blood pressure medication, or perhaps old Mr. Abernathy, needing a refill on his hemorrhoid cream and eager to recount his bowel movements in excruciating detail. 

Willow Creek, Pennsylvania, a town nestled amongst the gentle, perpetually-misty hills, was a place where secrets festered beneath a veneer of folksy charm. The kind of place where everyone knew everyone else's business, or at least thought they did. It was also the kind of place where nothing much ever happened. Except, perhaps, the occasional blue-ribbon winning pie at the annual county fair, or the drama surrounding the local high school football team.

Eleanor had inherited the apothecary from her grandfather, a gruff but beloved man who had served the town's medical needs for over fifty years. She’d left Willow Creek after high school, chasing a dream of a life beyond endless fields of corn and the suffocating closeness of its inhabitants. She’d achieved that dream, becoming a respected pharmacist in a bustling Philadelphia hospital. But then, her grandfather’s health had failed, and the pull of family, duty, and a strange, melancholic fondness for the familiar had brought her back. Now, three years later, she often found herself staring at the swirling dust motes dancing in the afternoon sunlight, wondering if she hadn't simply traded one kind of cage for another.

The jingling bell sounded again, this time followed by a sharp, nervous cough. Still, Eleanor didn’t look up. “Be with you in a moment,” she mumbled, carefully counting out the last few tablets. The air hung heavy with the scent of dried herbs, lavender, and the faint, metallic tang of something she couldn't quite place. She’d learn to place it soon enough, she suspected. Something told her that today, in the sleepy town of Willow Creek, something was about to happen. Something significant. Something… unsettling.
