The humid Mississippi air hung thick and heavy, even as the sun began its slow descent, painting the sky in bruised hues of orange and violet. Inside the cramped, fluorescent-lit confines of Room 217 at Clarksdale High, Evangeline Mae Dubois was already feeling the weight of it all: the air, the expectation, the lingering scent of teenage angst mixed with industrial cleaner. Chalk dust clung to her navy blue dress like stubborn memories, and the rhythmic squeak of her rocking chair, a comforting anachronism in the sterile classroom, was the only sound louder than her own thoughts.

This was her sanctuary, or at least, it was supposed to be. Usually, surrounded by the well-worn copies of "The Great Gatsby" and the haphazardly constructed dioramas of ancient Greece, Evangeline found a quiet joy. Today, however, the silence was unsettling. The end-of-term paperwork was piled high on her desk, a daunting monument to another year weathered, and the ghost of a recent, heated exchange with Principal Thompson hung heavy in the air, a constant reminder that even sanctuary wasn't always sacred.
