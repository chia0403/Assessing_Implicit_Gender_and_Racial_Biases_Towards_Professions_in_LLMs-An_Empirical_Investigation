The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the dilapidated garage, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic thumping in Amelia "Ace"  Ashworth's chest.  The air, thick with the smell of damp earth and stale beer, hung heavy in the space, punctuated by the occasional mournful howl from a stray dog somewhere in the shadowed alleys beyond.  Ace, her trench coat plastered to her thin frame, hunched over a chipped Formica table, her brow furrowed as she meticulously examined a faded photograph.

Setting:  The grimy back alleys and rain-slicked streets of  Newhaven, a city choked by the shadow of its industrial past.  A city where secrets festered like forgotten refuse in the forgotten corners, and whispers carried on the wind like slivers of broken glass.  The city's heart beat in a ragged rhythm, a pulse of despair and desperation.  Towering, soot-stained factories loomed over the narrow streets, their skeletal frames reaching into the overcast sky like grasping fingers.  The once-vibrant harbour now lay quiet, its docks echoing with the ghostly clang of forgotten machinery.  It was a city built on grit and shadows, and Ace, a private investigator with a past as murky as the Thames, was perfectly suited to navigating its labyrinthine depths.
