The fluorescent lights of Mrs. Amelia Peabody's third-grade classroom hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to the ceaseless chatter.  Crayon shavings littered the desks like fallen snow, and the air, thick with the scent of glue and unidentifiable snack remnants, felt almost suffocating.  Amelia, a woman whose auburn hair was perpetually escaping its neat bun, sighed, running a hand through her tangled tresses.  It was a Tuesday afternoon, the week before spring break, and the relentless energy of her students was threatening to overwhelm her.  Outside, the crisp, spring air buzzed with the insistent chirping of unseen birds, a stark contrast to the contained chaos within the classroom walls.

**Setting:** A brightly colored, yet slightly cluttered, third-grade classroom in a small, suburban elementary school. The school sits on the edge of a gently sloping hill overlooking a quiet neighborhood, with the faint sound of traffic a constant background hum.  Sunlight streams through the windows, catching dust motes dancing in the air, highlighting the kaleidoscope of artwork adorning the walls. The faint aroma of freshly brewed coffee and cinnamon rolls filters in from the nearby staff room.
