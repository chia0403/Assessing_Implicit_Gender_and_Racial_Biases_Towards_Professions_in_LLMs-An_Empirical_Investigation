The chill wind whipped through the narrow alley, carrying the scent of brine and rotting fish, a familiar counterpoint to the cloying sweetness of the butcher shop's own aroma.  Barnaby "Barn"  Grimshaw, his face a mask of grim determination, wiped a glistening bead of sweat from his brow with the back of a calloused hand.  The small, cramped shop, "Grimshaw's Good Cuts," was bathed in the flickering light of a single gas lamp, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to mock the relentless chill.  Meat, in varying shades of crimson and taupe, hung from hooks, their weight a tangible presence in the air.  A sharp, metallic tang hung heavy in the air, competing with the ever-present scent of sawdust and the faint, yet persistent, whiff of something decidedly *un*butcher-like... something almost... floral.

The setting was the shadowed back alleys and narrow cobblestone streets of Blackwood, a city infamous for its festering poverty and its ever-present sense of impending doom.  Blackwood, nestled between the towering spires of the wealthy district and the sprawling, desolate industrial zone, was a place where shadows held secrets and whispers carried stories of whispered deals and unspoken horrors.  Barn felt the weight of Blackwood's secrets pressing down on him, a constant, heavy cloak that seemed to cling to the very air he breathed.  He knew, deep within the marrow of his bones, that this scent, this peculiar floral note, was intimately tied to the city's underbelly and the dark bargains that were struck in its shadowed corners. And he was, perhaps, about to find himself squarely in the middle of one.
