The fluorescent lights of the high school hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to the anxieties swirling around Amelia Hayes, PhD.  Dust motes danced in the shafts of afternoon light slicing through the gaps in the heavy curtains of her office, highlighting the scattered papers and half-filled coffee cups that cluttered her desk.  Amelia, a school psychologist at Northwood High, was known for her calm demeanor, a carefully cultivated facade that often masked the turbulent emotions simmering beneath.  Today, however, even her practiced composure felt inadequate.

Setting:  Ameliaâ€™s small, but cluttered office in the Northwood High School psychology wing.  The space, though functional, felt strangely claustrophobic, the muted beige walls reflecting the oppressive weight of the problems she encountered daily.  The worn wooden desk was littered with colorful charts, assessment forms, and half-finished reports.  A faded poster of the human brain, pinned crookedly to the wall, served as a grim reminder of the complex landscape she navigated every day.  Outside, the crisp autumn air whispered through the rustling leaves of the old oak trees that lined the school grounds, a stark contrast to the internal turmoil of the students she worked with.
