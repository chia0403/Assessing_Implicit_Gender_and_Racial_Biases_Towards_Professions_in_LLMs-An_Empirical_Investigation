The biting wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vance's lab coat around her legs as she hunched against the skeletal frame of the old barn.  Dust devils, kicked up by the relentless winter gale, swirled around the weathered corrugated metal roof, carrying with them the ghosts of countless livestock and the low, mournful bleating of a lost lamb.  The air, thick with the scent of pine needles and decaying hay, hung heavy and cold, a stark contrast to the warmth radiating from the flickering kerosene lamp she held clutched in her gloved hand.  She knelt beside the huddled sheep, its fleece matted with icy spray, its ribs painfully prominent beneath the thin skin.  This remote valley, nestled deep within the Appalachian foothills, was her domain, a kingdom of rusting farm machinery and whispering pines, and tonight, it was her responsibility.


The year was 1928. The valley, known as Hollow Creek, had been her family's livelihood for generations.  The isolated farms, each clinging to the sides of the mountains, were often forgotten by the outside world, a land of quiet desperation and even quieter hope.  Eleanor, born and raised in the valley, had inherited not just the responsibility of caring for the animals, but a quiet, almost unspoken vow to protect them.  The local veterinarian had passed, leaving a void that stretched beyond the absence of medical care.   Her small, makeshift clinic, crammed within the barn's dilapidated interior, was the last line of defense against the harsh realities of rural life, a testament to her love for the animals and her determination to stay.
