The scent of pine needles and damp earth hung heavy in the air, clinging to Dr. Alistair Finch's tweed jacket as he stepped out of his battered, but beloved, 1973 Volkswagen Beetle.  The small, moss-covered sign, barely clinging to the weathered wooden post, read "Finch Family Chiropractic."  Alistair adjusted his glasses, the lenses reflecting the late afternoon sun filtering through the canopy of the ancient Redwood forest that bordered his practice.  Nestled deep within the towering trees, the office was a secluded haven, a world apart from the relentless hum of the nearby coastal town of Seabrook. The sound of the Pacific Ocean, a constant, rhythmic roar, barely reached this quiet sanctuary.  He pushed open the creaky wooden door, the old floorboards groaning beneath his weight.  Inside, the air hung thick with the familiar aroma of lavender oil and the faint, almost imperceptible, scent of cedarwood.  A single, flickering light bulb cast long shadows across the room, highlighting the dusty shelves filled with antique medical texts and the gentle, rhythmic clicking of the adjustment tables.  Today, a particularly difficult case awaited him - a young surfer, known in Seabrook for his daring exploits, had come in with a nagging lower back pain.  How could he fix what the unforgiving waves had wrought?
