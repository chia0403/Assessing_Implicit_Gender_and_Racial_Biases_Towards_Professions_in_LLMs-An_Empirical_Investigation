The biting wind, a relentless sculptor itself, whipped Elias Thorne’s roughspun cloak around him.  Dust, the colour of dried blood, swirled in the meagre sunlight that pierced the grey canopy of the Whispering Peaks.  He stood at the precipice of the quarry, a jagged scar in the mountainside, the granite echoing his own weariness.  For Elias Thorne, stone cutter, the mountain was more than just a source of livelihood; it was a constant, demanding companion, a silent judge of his skill.  He surveyed the massive, grey monolith before him, a block of Carrara marble, its pristine white a stark contrast to the surrounding, weathered rock. This was the heart of his next project – a monument, he knew, to a forgotten king, commissioned by the newly risen House Alderan.  His calloused hands trembled slightly, a flicker of apprehension beneath the practiced calm.  The weight of expectation pressed down on him, a pressure he felt not just in his hands but in every fibre of his being.  The whispers of the mountain, amplified by the wind, seemed to echo the unspoken demands.
