The biting wind whipped Amelia Hawthorne, Judge of the Provincial Court of Oakhaven, across the cobbled plaza.  Rain, a relentless curtain of grey, obscured the already dim gas lamps, shrouding the meticulously maintained town square in a perpetual twilight.  The aroma of roasted chestnuts and damp earth mingled with the acrid scent of brine from the nearby docks, a constant reminder of the sea's proximity and the constant, unpredictable nature of the North Sea.  Oakhaven, nestled between the rugged cliffs and the ceaseless waves, clung precariously to its existence, a town carved from the very heart of the storm.  Amelia, her dark cloak billowing around her, hurried towards the courthouse, the weighty gavel in her pocket a familiar counterpoint to the relentless tempest outside.  Inside, the flickering gaslight illuminated a courtroom buzzing with the hushed whispers of the accused and the expectant murmurs of the assembled townsfolk.  The case of the missing mariner, Captain Silas Blackwood, was set to begin.  The fate of the sea, and of Oakhaven itself, seemed to rest on the delicate balance of justice.
