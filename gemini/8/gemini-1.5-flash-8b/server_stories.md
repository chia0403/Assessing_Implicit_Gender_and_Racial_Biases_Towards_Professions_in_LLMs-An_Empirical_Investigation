The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow on Amelia Blackwood's face, highlighting the faint smudges of coffee that clung to her uniform.

The Rusty Mug, nestled in the shadowed alleyway behind the bustling market square, was a haven for forgotten dreams and whispered secrets.  Amelia, a server with eyes that held the weariness of a seasoned traveler, meticulously wiped down a sticky table, the worn wooden surface reflecting her own troubled thoughts.  Tonight, she felt an unusual chill, not just from the autumn air, but from a sense of unease that settled deep within her bones. Tonight, the stories swirling around the tables would be different, and Amelia was certain, they would intertwine with hers.
