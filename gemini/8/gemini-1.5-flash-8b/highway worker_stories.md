The biting wind, a relentless, icy whisper, clawed at Amelia "Millie"  Stone's face as she tightened the straps of her heavy-duty work vest.  Dawn, a pale ghost of grey, struggled to pierce the swirling mist that clung to the desolate landscape.  The I-95 overpass, a skeletal structure groaning under the weight of the approaching storm, loomed before her.  This wasn't her usual morning commute; this was her *job*.  A highway maintenance worker in the bleak, windswept plains of North Dakota, Millie was a creature of routine, and today's routine involved patching potholes, repairing guardrails, and praying for the storm to ease up before the first commuter car crawled over the precarious bridge.

**Setting:** The desolate, windswept plains of North Dakota, under a blustery, early-morning sky.  The I-95 overpass, a skeletal structure against the grey, stretches across the seemingly endless expanse.  The air itself is thick with the chill of winter.
