The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the polished mahogany floor of Lady Beatrice Blackwood's drawing-room.  Dust motes, illuminated like tiny, ethereal fireflies, swirled in the faint currents of air.  Agnes Periwinkle, a woman whose hands, though nimble and strong, bore the quiet marks of years spent scrubbing and polishing, meticulously arranged a silver tea service.  The scent of lavender, a comforting balm in the grand, echoing room, mingled with the faint, musty aroma of old parchment and aged leather.  Agnes, her starched uniform a stark contrast to the opulent surroundings, felt a familiar tremor of apprehension.  Tonight was the Blackwood's annual soir√©e, a glittering spectacle that always seemed to threaten to swallow her whole with its opulence. Tonight, the famous and the infamous would gather within these walls, and Agnes, the humble housekeeper, would be but a silent, unseen presence. Tonight, something was different.  A subtle shift in the air, a hint of unspoken anticipation, clung to the very fabric of the house. This house, Blackwood Manor, nestled on the windswept slopes overlooking the churning grey sea, held secrets as deep and dark as the ocean itself.
