The fluorescent lights of the "Every Day Needs" grocery store hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia Blackwood's life.  Rows upon rows of neatly stacked produce – vibrant reds, plump greens, golden yellows – seemed to mock the muted palette of her grey uniform.  The air, thick with the scent of ripe tomatoes and the faintest whiff of disinfectant, felt stale, a constant reminder of the repetitive nature of her job.  Amelia, 27, with her perpetually tired eyes and hair pulled back in a tight bun, was currently scanning a basket overflowing with wilting spinach and a single, suspiciously large, head of broccoli.  Outside, the sun beat down on the city, a stark contrast to the cool, sterile interior of the store.  The only sound besides the scanner's beep was the low, rhythmic rumble of the aging refrigeration unit, a constant companion.  Tonight, though, that familiar hum seemed to vibrate with an unnerving intensity.  It felt different. Something was... off.
