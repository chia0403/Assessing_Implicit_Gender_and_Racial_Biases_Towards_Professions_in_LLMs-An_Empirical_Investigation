The biting wind, a razor-sharp shard of Arctic air, clawed at Amelia "Ames" Blackwood's face as the Falcon roared down the runway.  Below, the frozen tundra stretched out like a canvas painted in shades of grey and white, punctuated by the occasional, skeletal remains of a long-abandoned mining outpost.  Ames, her knuckles white around the controls, felt a familiar thrum of adrenaline mix with a chilling premonition.  Today wasn't just another routine flight reconnaissance mission over the desolate, almost forgotten, Blackwood Plateau.  This was personal.

**Setting:** The desolate Blackwood Plateau, a high-altitude, windswept region in the remote northern reaches of the world, several decades into the future.  Technology has advanced, but pockets of the world remain largely untouched by progress.  The icy, desolate terrain is scarred by the remnants of bygone industries, whispering tales of past expeditions and forgotten hopes.  The air is thin, the temperatures plummeting, and the silence is broken only by the wind and the rhythmic hum of aircraft engines.  The atmosphere is both breathtaking and menacing.
