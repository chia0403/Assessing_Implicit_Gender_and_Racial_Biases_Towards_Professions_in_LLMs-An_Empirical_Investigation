The biting wind, a relentless harbinger of the approaching winter, whipped through the gaps in the crumbling stone walls of the old courthouse.  Rain, a relentless grey curtain, hammered against the slate roof, mirroring the storm brewing inside Amelia Cavendish-Hayes, Senior Counsel.  The air, thick with the smell of mildew and stale coffee, clung to the threadbare carpets and aged oak furniture of the courtroom, a silent witness to countless legal battles.  This one, however, felt different.  This one felt personal.

Amelia, a woman sculpted from granite and honed by years of relentless legal skirmishes, sat hunched over her meticulously organized briefcase, the leather worn smooth from countless journeys through the labyrinthine halls of justice.  Her sharp eyes, the colour of stormy seas, scanned the room, taking in the hushed expectancy in the faces of the plaintiffs and defendants, the watchful stares of the judge, and the barely suppressed tension radiating from her opponent, the formidable barrister, Silas Blackwood.

The courtroom, a relic of a bygone era, stood on the edge of the city, a place swallowed by shadows and whispered stories.  Ancient, imposing oak trees formed a skeletal canopy above, their gnarled branches reaching like skeletal fingers towards the grey, overcast sky.  Beyond the barred windows, the city sprawled out, a tapestry of lights and shadows, a bustling metropolis indifferent to the drama unfolding within these crumbling walls. This specific courtroom, however, had a reputation for hosting the city's most intractable, most intriguing cases.  This was the courtroom where whispers of injustice were heard, where shadows danced with the law.
