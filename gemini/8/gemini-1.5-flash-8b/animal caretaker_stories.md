The biting wind whipped Amelia Nightingale's auburn hair across her face as she squinted at the swirling snow blanketing the craggy peaks of the Cairngorms National Park.  The air, thin and crisp, stung her lungs.  Her breath puffed out in white clouds, mirroring the frosted breath of the snow leopard nestled in its enclosure, a magnificent creature named "Whisper" that was one of Amelia’s prized charges.  Amelia, Animal Caretaker at the remote, high-altitude Cairngorm Sanctuary, was used to the elements.  This was her fourth winter, and she loved it, despite the relentless cold and isolation.  The Sanctuary, a haven for endangered wildlife rescued from poaching and habitat loss, sat nestled in a valley, surrounded by towering mountains that seemed to press in against the fragile peace within.  Inside, a network of enclosures, each meticulously crafted to replicate the natural habitats of their inhabitants, hummed with a quiet life of its own.  The harsh beauty of the Scottish Highlands, though, was a stark counterpoint to the gentle care Amelia lavished on the creatures under her charge.  The crisp air, tinged with the scent of pine and damp earth, carried an unspoken promise of adventure, and today, it felt… charged.  A shiver of something more than the usual winter chill prickled her skin.
