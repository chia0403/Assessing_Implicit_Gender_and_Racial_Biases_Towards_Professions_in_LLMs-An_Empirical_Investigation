The scent of sandalwood and lavender hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket around Amelia Blackwood, massage therapist extraordinaire.  Her small, dimly lit clinic, nestled between a bustling bakery and a perpetually overflowing antique shop, hummed with a quiet energy.  Sunlight, filtered through the lace curtains of the window, painted the walls in a warm, golden hue, highlighting the intricate floral patterns of the wallpaper.  A delicate chime tinkled as the door opened, announcing the arrival of another client.  Amelia, her hands poised over a worn, leather-bound massage book, smiled faintly, the faintest hint of a weariness etched around her eyes.  Another day, another set of aching muscles, another story to be unwound.
