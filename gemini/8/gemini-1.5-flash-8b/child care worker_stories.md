The chipped paint of the playroom walls, a faded pastel lavender, seemed to absorb the afternoon sun, turning it into a muted, almost ghostly light.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom, illuminating tiny, discarded blocks scattered across the floor.  Eleven-year-old Amelia “Em”  Montgomery, her worn cardigan pulled tight against the chill, surveyed the scene with a practiced eye.  The children, a chaotic whirlwind of energy only moments before, had quieted.  Now, they sat in scattered clumps, their focused silence punctuated only by the occasional rustle of paper or the soft click of a pencil. Em, a child care worker at the Sunny Days Daycare Centre, knew these moments.  They were the quiet lulls before the storm. The storm of art projects, tantrums, and boisterous games that always followed.  Today, however, a different kind of calm settled over the room, a stillness that mirrored a growing unease in her own chest.  The setting sun cast long shadows across the room, each one seeming to lengthen with the accumulating silence.
