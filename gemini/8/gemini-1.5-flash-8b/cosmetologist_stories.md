Rain lashed against the chipped paint of the salon windows, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Amelia Blackwood.  The rhythmic drumming on the glass punctuated the frantic clicking of her manicurist's shears, the snipping sound a jarring counterpoint to the quiet sobs escaping from the back room.
