The flickering neon sign of the "Grand Zenith Hotel" cast an unsettling, emerald glow on Amelia Petrova's face as she surveyed the deserted lobby.  Rain lashed against the enormous panoramic windows, mirroring the tempest brewing within her.  The hotel, usually a symphony of hushed conversations, bustling staff, and the clinking of silverware, was eerily silent.  It was a Tuesday, a night usually teeming with guests anticipating dinner at the renowned "Celestial" restaurant.  But tonight, only the ghosts of laughter and the faint scent of jasmine lingered in the air, punctuated by the rhythmic drip, drip, drip of water from a leaky pipe somewhere within the grand, marble corridors.

Amelia, Concierge extraordinaire of the Grand Zenith, adjusted the worn leather straps of her satchel, the weight a tangible representation of her mounting anxieties.  The hotel was unusually quiet.  Uncharacteristically quiet.  A premonition, cold and sharp, settled in her stomach.  She was alone, her duty was hers alone, amidst the silent grandeur that had once been her sanctuary. Tonight, it felt like a tomb.  The polished mahogany of the reception desk, normally reflecting the warm glow of the city lights, now seemed to absorb the encroaching gloom.
