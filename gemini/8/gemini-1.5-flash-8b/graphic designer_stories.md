The fluorescent hum of the design studio, a cacophony of keyboard clacks and the rhythmic whir of a laser cutter, was a familiar lullaby to Amelia Blackwood.  Dust motes danced in the sliver of afternoon sun slicing through the grimy windowpanes of "Pixel Pushers," a cramped, yet surprisingly vibrant, space nestled between a vintage bookstore and a perpetually overflowing Chinese takeout joint. Amelia, a graphic designer with a penchant for bold typography and a soul full of unspoken stories, hunched over her desk, her fingers flying across the keyboard.  Today's project: a rebranding for a local bakery, "Sweet Surrender," a shop renowned for its exquisitely crafted, yet inexplicably melancholic, pastries.
