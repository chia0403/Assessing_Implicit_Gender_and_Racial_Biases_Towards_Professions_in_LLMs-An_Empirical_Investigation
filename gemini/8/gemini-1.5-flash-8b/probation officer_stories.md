Rain hammered against the grimy windows of the probation office, mimicking the relentless rhythm of Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's thoughts.  The stale coffee scent, a familiar comfort, couldn't mask the knot tightening in her stomach.  It was 2:17 AM, and the fluorescent lights hummed with a sterile, unnerving energy.  Her tiny cubicle, tucked away on the third floor of the District Attorney's office, felt more like a cold, concrete cell than a sanctuary.  Outside, the city of New Verona thrummed with a nocturnal energy Amy had come to associate with hidden crimes and whispered secrets.  The city was a tapestry woven with shadows, a canvas for the injustices she saw every day, and tonight, those shadows felt particularly long and menacing.  

The setting was the heart of New Verona, a sprawling metropolis built on a forgotten industrial past.  Towering skyscrapers, gleaming with a thousand artificial lights, cast long, skeletal shadows across the cobbled alleyways and darkened plazas.  The rain-slicked streets echoed with the faint sounds of distant sirens and the muttered conversations of the city's underbelly.  Amy's office building, a brutalist concrete monolith, stood sentinel over the chaos, a stark reminder of the legal machinery she was part of, a machinery that often felt as broken as the lives she was tasked with overseeing.
