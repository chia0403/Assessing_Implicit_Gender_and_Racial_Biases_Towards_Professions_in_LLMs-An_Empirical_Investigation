The scent of sandalwood and something faintly metallic hung heavy in the air of "The Razor's Edge," a barbershop tucked away on a cobbled lane off the bustling marketplace of Veridian.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom of the small, windowless shop.  Barnaby "Barty"  Featherstone, a man whose face bore the faintest trace of a perpetual worry line etched by the pressures of life, meticulously sharpened his razor.  Each stroke, a tiny, precise dance of steel against steel, echoed the quiet rhythm of the town itself â€“ a rhythm Barty, in his own way, understood intimately.  Veridian wasn't known for its grand spectacles or boisterous celebrations.  It was a place where whispers of secrets and the hum of old, well-worn stories filled the air. And Barty, with his discerning eye and even more discerning hands, was one of its quiet keepers.
