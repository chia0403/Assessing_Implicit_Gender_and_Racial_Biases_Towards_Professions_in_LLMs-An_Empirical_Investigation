The biting wind whipped Amelia "Anya" Petrova's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks.  She adjusted the worn leather satchel slung across her shoulder, its contents – maps, brochures, and a well-worn copy of "The Lost Cities of the Andes" – feeling strangely comforting in the frigid air.  Below, the ancient Incan city of Machu Picchu, shrouded in a perpetual mist, seemed to breathe with a spectral silence.  Anya, with her vibrant red hair pulled back in a practical braid, stood at the precipice of the Sun Gate, the first glimpse of the lost city for the throng of tourists below.  Today's group – a mix of seasoned adventurers and first-time wanderers, most carrying cameras with lenses wide enough to capture the breathtaking vista –  thrummed with anticipation, barely audible above the wind’s mournful howl.  Anya, however, felt a different kind of anticipation, a knot of unease tightening in her stomach. This wasn’t just another tour.  This was personal.
