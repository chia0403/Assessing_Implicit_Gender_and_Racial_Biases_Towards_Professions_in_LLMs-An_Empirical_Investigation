The scent of aged mahogany and beeswax hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Eloise Nightingale, Interior Decorator.

The estate, perched atop a hill overlooking the rolling emerald countryside of the Cotswolds, exuded an aura of both grandeur and decay.  Ivy clawed at the stone walls, whispering tales of forgotten feasts and whispered secrets.  Wind chimes, long silenced, hung like forgotten melodies in the stillness.  The grand entrance hall, once a symphony of opulent furnishings, was now a dusty mausoleum of discarded furniture and faded tapestries.  This wasn't just about redecorating; it was about breathing life back into a place that had slowly, agonizingly, been suffocated by time and neglect. Eloise knew the Blackwood family's extravagant history, and whispered tales of their eccentric past swirled around the musty air.
