Stone walls, sculpted with intricate carvings, rose like ancient sentinels, their weathered surfaces whispering tales of forgotten feasts and whispered secrets.  Ivy, once a verdant embrace, now clawed at the decaying stonework, a testament to the estate's slow, agonizing decline.  Amelia, standing amidst the ruins of the formal gardens, felt a strange pull, a sense of responsibility, a feeling that she was meant to be here.
