The scent of mothballs and beeswax, a comforting yet slightly suffocating blend, hung heavy in the air of Amelia Nightingale’s atelier.  Sunlight, fractured by the stained-glass window depicting the martyrdom of Saint Agnes, painted shifting patterns on the floor, highlighting the meticulous piles of fabric – silks the colour of twilight, cottons the hue of summer rain, and velvets the depth of midnight – that spilled across the room.  Amelia Nightingale, her fingers stained a delicate shade of indigo from the latest batch of hand-dyed silk, hunched over her meticulously crafted pattern.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of light piercing the gloom of the attic workshop.  The chipped porcelain doll, perched on a stack of sketchbooks, seemed to observe her with silent, unblinking eyes.  This small, cramped room, tucked away on the top floor of the old Victorian townhouse, was Amelia’s sanctuary, her kingdom.  And tonight, a visit from a most unusual client awaited her.
