Professor Eleanor Vance-Ashworth, a woman whose tweed jacket seemed perpetually dusted with the faintest whisper of forgotten chalk, stared out at the swirling grey mist that clung to the cobbled streets of Oxford.  Rain, a persistent, leaden curtain, blurred the already indistinct architecture of the ancient buildings, their stone faces weathered and etched with centuries of history, secrets whispered in the damp air.  The scent of damp earth and decaying leaves hung heavy in the air, a palpable presence that mirrored the melancholy that settled in Professor Vance-Ashworth's chest.
