The biting wind whipped Amelia Hayes's lab coat around her legs, stinging her cheeks with icy particles.  The flickering sodium lights of the deserted highway painted the snow-dusted landscape in an eerie yellow glow.  A crumpled figure lay sprawled amidst the drifts, a stark silhouette against the monochrome expanse.  Amelia, her breath puffing white clouds in the frigid air, adjusted the strap of her medical bag, the familiar weight grounding her in the isolating vastness.  This was her 11th call in as many hours, the emergency medical care system strained to its breaking point by the relentless blizzard.  The small town of Oakhaven, nestled deep within the heart of the Appalachian mountains, had become an icy tomb. And she, Amelia Hayes, paramedic for the Oakhaven Volunteer Rescue Squad, was its lone, unwavering sentinel.

The setting: Oakhaven, a remote mountain town in the Appalachian region, clinging to a ridge during a ferocious winter blizzard.  The snow, already piled high, was still falling relentlessly, blanketing the landscape in a suffocating white.  Roads were impassable in places,  communication lines were unreliable, and the biting cold was not just a discomfort, but a tangible threat to anyone caught unprepared.  The air hung heavy with the scent of pine and impending danger.
