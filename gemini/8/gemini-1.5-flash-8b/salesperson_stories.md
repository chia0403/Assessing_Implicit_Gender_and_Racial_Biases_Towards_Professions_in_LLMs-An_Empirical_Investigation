The fluorescent lights of the "Everything Under the Sun" department store hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Butterfield's existential dread.  Rows upon rows of brightly colored, meticulously organized trinkets – from novelty socks shaped like miniature dinosaurs to exquisitely crafted miniature replica Eiffel Towers – stretched before her, a dizzying array of consumerist desires.  Amelia, a salesperson in the "Home Décor" section, felt like she was standing inside a meticulously curated prison.  Each meticulously displayed item seemed to mock her with its perfect, manufactured happiness.  Today, the fluorescent hum intensified as Amelia felt it more than ever.  The store, sprawling across three levels, smelled faintly of old paper and disinfectant, a sickly sweet aroma that clung to her clothes like a second skin.  Outside, the city of Veridian sprawled in a haze of smog, a concrete jungle mirroring the overwhelming feeling inside her.
