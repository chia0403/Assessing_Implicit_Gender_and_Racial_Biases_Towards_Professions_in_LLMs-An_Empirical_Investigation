The aroma of roasted paprika and garlic hung heavy in the air, a fragrant curtain shielding the chipped paint and peeling wallpaper of Amelia Blackwood's tiny kitchen.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of sunlight piercing the grime-coated window, illuminating a flurry of flour-dusted aprons, half-empty spice jars, and the faint outline of a forgotten loaf of bread on a countertop cluttered with overflowing mixing bowls.  Amelia Blackwood, her name stitched in faded embroidery onto the collar of her chef's jacket, knelt before a battered wooden table, painstakingly shaping a delicate rose from a dollop of perfectly-formed pastry dough.  Each delicate petal, painstakingly sculpted, held a faint promise of something sweet, something comforting.  The rhythmic thump of her fingers against the dough was the only sound in the cramped space, punctuated only by the distant rumble of the city traffic, a constant, insistent hum outside her haven of flour and spices.  The year was 1932. London, England, simmered in the throes of the Great Depression.  But inside this small, cluttered kitchen, Amelia was building a world of her own.
