The fluorescent hum of the clinic's waiting room was a constant, low thrum, vibrating through Amelia Blackwood's boots as she navigated the sea of expectant faces.  Grey cubicle walls, painted a shade so dull it seemed to absorb the daylight, pressed in around her.  The sterile scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, punctuated by the faint, metallic tang of blood.  Amelia, a phlebotomist with a practiced grace that belied her twenty-four years, felt a familiar prickle of anxiety.  Not the kind that sent her heart racing, but a subtle unease that settled in her gut like a lead weight.  Today was different.  The patient, a man named Mr. Henderson, with eyes like chips of ice and a demeanor as frigid, was unnervingly still.  He sat slumped in the worn vinyl chair, his gaze fixed on the swirling dust motes dancing in the weak afternoon light.  Amelia felt a tremor run through her, a premonition that this routine blood draw might not be quite as ordinary as it seemed.
