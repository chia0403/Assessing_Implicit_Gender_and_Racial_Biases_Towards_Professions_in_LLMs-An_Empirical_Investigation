The biting wind whipped at Elias "Brick" Blackwood's hard hat, stinging his cheeks as he surveyed the skeletal frame of the new skyscraper.  Below, the city of Veridia sprawled out like a patchwork quilt of steel and glass, a glittering, almost mocking display of human ambition.  He adjusted his gloves, the leather stiffening against the early October chill.  Veridia, renowned for its relentless pursuit of progress, often seemed to forget the sacrifices demanded in its construction.  Brick had felt that sting many times in the years he'd spent clambering up its towers, chipping away at the stone and concrete that formed its heart.  Today, though, the air felt different.  A prickling sensation, more than just the wind, snaked its way through him, a premonition that perhaps, just perhaps, this project held more than just brick and mortar.

The construction site was a chaotic symphony of sound: the roar of jackhammers, the rhythmic clang of steel on steel, the low hum of unseen machinery.  Dust motes danced in the fading light, obscuring the intricate web of scaffolding that snaked upwards towards the still-uncompleted spire.  He worked on the 27th floor, overlooking the sprawling industrial district of Veridia, a zone swallowed by smokestacks and the relentless churn of industry.  The rhythmic hammering of the nearby crews was almost a lullaby, a soundtrack to the silent, solitary hours Brick spent contemplating his existence.
