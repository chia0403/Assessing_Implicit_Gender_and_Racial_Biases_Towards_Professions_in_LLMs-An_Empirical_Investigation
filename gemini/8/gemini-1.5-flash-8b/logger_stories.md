The biting wind, a razor-sharp whisper through the skeletal branches of the ancient pines, clawed at Elias Thorne's weathered face.  He squinted, his eyes, the colour of a stormy sea, searching the grey expanse of the Alaskan wilderness.

The year was 1928, and the Yukon Territory, a land of unforgiving beauty and brutal isolation, held Elias captive in its relentless embrace.  His axe, the familiar weight of seasoned maple in his calloused hand, was more than a tool; it was an extension of himself, a testament to the unforgiving life he'd carved out, a life steeped in the rhythm of the forest and the pulse of the timber.  Elias, a man forged in the crucible of the Alaskan woods, knew that survival here wasn't a choice, it was a constant, arduous battle.
