The fluorescent lights of the Occupational Therapy department hummed, a relentless counterpoint to the rhythmic clatter of Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's keyboard.  Rows of colourful therapy aids – brightly-painted blocks, textured balls, oversized puzzles – sat neatly arranged on shelves, their vibrant hues doing little to dispel the gloom that clung to the room like damp wool.  Rain hammered against the windowpanes, mirroring the relentless drip-drip-drip of frustration in Amy's mind.  It was a Monday, and the constant stream of patients with complex needs, compounded by the crushing workload, was making it a particularly challenging start to the week.  The aroma of antiseptic and stale coffee hung heavy in the air, a familiar, almost comforting, scent in the sterile sanctuary of the rehabilitation centre.

Setting:  The Occupational Therapy department of St. Jude's Rehabilitation Centre, a sprawling facility nestled within the quiet, leafy suburbs of a large city.  The therapy room, nestled on the second floor, was a large, rectangular space, bathed in the harsh glow of fluorescent lights.  The walls were a sterile, off-white, the air thick with the subtle yet unmistakable scent of cleaning products.  The room was packed with different therapy equipment, clearly labelled and organised by category: fine motor skills, gross motor skills, cognitive function, sensory processing.  The sheer volume of it all, and the constant presence of patients, made the space both intimidating and inspiring in equal measure.
