The biting November wind whipped Amelia Nightingaleâ€™s hair across her face as she hurried down the cobbled lane.  The scent of woodsmoke mingled with the damp earth, a familiar comfort in the otherwise desolate landscape.  She adjusted her worn, but ever-reliable, wool scarf, pulling it tighter around her neck against the chill.  Today, the rhythmic thud of her boots against the uneven stones seemed unusually loud, amplified by the near-silence of the village of Oakhaven.  Every cottage window was dark, save for a single, flickering lamplight emanating from the window of a small, almost hidden workshop just beyond the bend.  This was where she was headed.

Setting:

Oakhaven was a picturesque but isolated village nestled in a valley carved by the winding River Ash.  Autumn had painted the surrounding hills with fiery hues of crimson and gold, but now, in the grip of winter, a pervasive stillness clung to the air, broken only by the creaking of ancient trees and the occasional howl of the wind.  The buildings, huddled together for warmth, were constructed of weathered timber and stone, their dark colours blending seamlessly with the shadowed landscape.  The workshop, a small, low-slung structure clinging to the slope, was barely discernible from the surrounding trees, its only visible indication of presence being the single, flickering lamp.  Within, Amelia hoped to find a source of both work and a moment of respite.
