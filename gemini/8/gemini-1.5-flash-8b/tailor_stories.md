The biting November wind whipped across the cobblestone streets of Old St. Germain, stinging Elodie Dubois’ cheeks as she hurried towards her workshop.  The scent of woodsmoke and roasted chestnuts hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the sharp tang of brine rising from the Seine.  Leafy debris, swirling like confetti, danced in the gloom.  Elodie, a tailor of considerable renown in the Parisian Quarter, adjusted her worn, yet meticulously pressed, dark-blue apron.  Her workshop, tucked away on a narrow alley, was a sanctuary of calm amidst the bustling city; a haven of delicate fabrics, carefully pinned patterns, and the rhythmic clack of her needle against thread.  Within, the fire crackled merrily, casting dancing shadows on the intricate embroidery patterns laid out across a large, polished table.  Inside, the air was thick with the intoxicating aroma of beeswax and freshly pressed linen.  She clutched a sketch, a miniature masterpiece depicting a gown of shimmering silk and intricate lace, a commission from a discerning client – Madame de Valois.
