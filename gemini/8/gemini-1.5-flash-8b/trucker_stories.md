The fluorescent lights of the Pilot's Inn hummed, a monotonous counterpoint to the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Jasper "Jax" Blackwood's heart.  He stared out the grimy window at the endless expanse of the Nebraska plains, the endless cornfields stretching to the horizon like a sea of emerald green.  Dust devils danced across the cracked asphalt, mimicking the turmoil brewing inside him.  Jax, a seasoned trucker with calloused hands and eyes that held the weariness of a thousand miles, was stranded.  Not by mechanical failure, not by a flat tire, but by something far more insidious: a cryptic message scrawled on a faded napkin, left on his dashboard in the dead of night.  It read simply, "The Willow Creek Ghost."

The setting:  A desolate stretch of Interstate 80, somewhere between Omaha and Denver.  The Pilot's Inn, a roadside haven for weary travelers, offered a wearying symphony of the mundaneâ€”the clatter of trays, the murmur of conversations, the clatter of tires outside, each sounding like a dull drumbeat in Jax's head.  The year was 1998.  The air hung heavy with the scent of diesel and cheap coffee.  Outside, the vast and unforgiving landscape of the American Midwest stretched out, indifferent to the anxieties of the man caught in its grip.
