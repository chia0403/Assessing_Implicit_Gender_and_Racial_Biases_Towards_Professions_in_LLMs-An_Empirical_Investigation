The biting wind whipped Amelia Hawthorne's auburn hair across her face as she surveyed the skeletal remains of the old mill.  Grey, skeletal fingers of concrete and rusted metal clawed at the bruised sky, mirroring the aching emptiness in Amelia's chest.  The air, thick with the smell of damp earth and forgotten machinery, tasted of ash and regret.  This was  "The Leviathan," a project she'd poured her heart and soul into, a sprawling, ambitious design for a sustainable community nestled amongst the unforgiving peaks of the Adirondack Mountains.  Now, only jagged shards of hope remained.

The year was 2042.  The remnants of a severe winter storm had left the once-vibrant construction site a desolate wasteland, littered with discarded tools and the ghostly silhouettes of abandoned structures. Amelia, Architect extraordinaire,  stood alone, her gaze fixed on the fractured landscape that represented both the culmination of a dream and the cruel reality of human fallibility.  She was here, not to mourn, but to salvage what was leftâ€”a task far more daunting than rebuilding the steel frame of the mill.  The town's investors had pulled out just weeks before completion, leaving Amelia and her dwindling team of dedicated workers in the treacherous aftermath of a catastrophic collapse in the global economy.  The very air, it seemed, held a suffocating weight of doubt and uncertainty.
