The biting wind, a razor-edged whisper against the steel and glass of the high-rise, whipped Amelia Petrova's crimson fire-resistant jacket around her.  Below, the city sprawled in a chaotic tapestry of lights, a glittering, indifferent backdrop to the inferno raging within the twenty-seventh floor of the Zenith Tower.  The air, thick with the acrid tang of burning plastic and ozone, stung her lungs.  She gripped the fire hose, the pressure a relentless thrum against her calloused palm.  The building groaned, a skeletal whisper under the relentless assault of the flames.  Each second felt like an eternity.

Setting:  The fictional city of Veridia, a metropolis of towering skyscrapers built on reclaimed land by the Veridian River.  Known for its innovative architecture and booming tech industry, Veridia also bore the scars of its rapid development;  its high-rises, while impressive, were often constructed with fast, cheap materials, making them particularly vulnerable to fire. This particular blaze, erupting in the recently opened Zenith Tower, a hub for cutting-edge software development, was already drawing national media attention.
