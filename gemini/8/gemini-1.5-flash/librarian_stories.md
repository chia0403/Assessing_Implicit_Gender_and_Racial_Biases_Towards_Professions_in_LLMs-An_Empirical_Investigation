The scent of aged paper and leather hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma that usually soothed Eleanor Vance's soul.  But tonight, the familiar fragrance only served to heighten the prickling unease crawling up her spine.  Rain lashed against the gothic windows of the Blackwood Public Library, each gust rattling the ancient panes as if trying to claw its way inside.  Eleanor, perched behind the oak circulation desk, her spectacles perched precariously on her nose, watched the storm rage outside with a growing sense of foreboding.  The library, usually a haven of quiet contemplation, felt strangelyâ€¦alive.  The only sounds besides the tempest were the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner and the unsettling whisper of the wind whistling through a crack in the ill-fitting window near the Dewey Decimal system.  Tonight, the hushed silence of Blackwood Public Library felt far more sinister than any storm.
