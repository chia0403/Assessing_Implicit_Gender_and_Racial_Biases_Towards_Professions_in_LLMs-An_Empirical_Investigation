The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume only Aurelia “Relly” Blackwood could conjure.  Relly, owner and sole stylist of “Shear Bliss” salon, perched precariously on a ladder, attempting to wrestle a recalcitrant spotlight back into its socket.  The salon itself, nestled on a cobbled side street in the ancient, perpetually damp town of Port Blossom, was a charming chaos of mismatched furniture and overflowing flowerpots.  Sunlight, fractured by the stained-glass window depicting a rather flamboyant mermaid, dappled the worn wooden floorboards, illuminating dust motes dancing in the otherwise dim interior.  The rhythmic clatter of the sea against the harbour wall, just beyond the shop’s single, rain-streaked window, provided a steady, melancholic counterpoint to the frantic buzz of Relly’s internal monologue. Tonight was the annual Port Blossom Regatta Ball, and if Relly didn't get the lighting sorted, her clients – and their meticulously crafted updos – would be doomed to photographic obscurity.
