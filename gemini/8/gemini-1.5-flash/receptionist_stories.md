The fluorescent lights of the Zenith Corporation hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia “Mia” Hernandez’s otherwise silent morning.  At precisely 7:58 AM, the faint scent of stale coffee and desperation permeated the air, a familiar pre-dawn aroma that clung to the plush, yet threadbare, carpet of the reception area.  Mia, perched on her ergonomic chair (a perk she’d fought hard for during her negotiation), adjusted her perfectly-straight, auburn braid, the only splash of vibrant colour in the otherwise beige and grey landscape of Zenith’s lobby.  Rain lashed against the expansive glass windows, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her – it was Monday, and the answering machine was already blinking a menacing red.
