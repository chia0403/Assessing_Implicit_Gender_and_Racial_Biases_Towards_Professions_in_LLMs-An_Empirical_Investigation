The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Amy” Hernandez’s hair across her face as she wrestled a recalcitrant bale of hay into the goat pen.  Pine needles, shed from the ancient Douglas firs that ringed the sprawling Whispering Pines Animal Sanctuary, crunched under her worn work boots.  The air, sharp with the scent of damp earth and woodsmoke, carried the faint, almost musical bleating of the goats, a counterpoint to the mournful howl of a lone coyote echoing from the distant hills.  Amy, her cheeks flushed crimson against the pale morning light, didn’t flinch. This was her symphony, the chaotic yet comforting chorus of Whispering Pines, a place she’d called home – and a place she fiercely protected – for the last five years.
