The chipped paint of the "Welcome to Northwood High" sign flaked onto the asphalt like a dying butterfly, mirroring the slow decay Amelia Katherine Blackwood felt creeping into her own spirit.  It was a Tuesday, the kind that smelled faintly of stale coffee and impending doom, a scent Amelia had become intimately familiar with over her thirteen years teaching AP English at this institution.  Northwood High clung to the edge of Willow Creek, a town so small its only claim to fame was the annual county fair, which smelled significantly better than the school.  The school itself, a brutalist concrete monolith, seemed determined to leach the joy from even the most vibrant soul.  This Tuesday, it was succeeding remarkably well.
