The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face, a familiar kiss from the unforgiving Atlantic.  He braced himself against the relentless wind, the biting chill seeping through his worn leather jacket despite the multiple layers beneath.  The cliffs of Cornwall clawed at the bruised, grey sky, a dramatic backdrop to the churning sea far below.  Waves, monstrous and grey-green, crashed against the jagged rocks with a thunderous roar that vibrated in Elias's chest, a counterpoint to the rhythmic whirring of his drone ascending into the turbulent sky.  His weathered hands, calloused from years spent handling cameras and climbing precarious heights, gripped the controller with a practiced ease. This wasn't just a photoshoot; it was a pilgrimage, a desperate attempt to capture the raw, untamed beauty of a coastline that held a painful secret, a secret Elias Thorne was determined to photograph, even if it meant facing his own ghosts in the process.
