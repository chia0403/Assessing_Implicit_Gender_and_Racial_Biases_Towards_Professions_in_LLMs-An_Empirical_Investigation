The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia "Mia" Hawthorne's hands, a paltry defense against the November chill that seeped through the single-pane window of her attic office.  Rain lashed against the glass, a relentless drumming that mirrored the frantic rhythm of her own thoughts.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single bare bulb hanging precariously above her cluttered desk, danced in the weak light.  Stacks of manuscripts, their pages dog-eared and annotated with Mia's spidery script, threatened to topple at any moment.  The air hung thick with the scent of old paper, stale coffee, and the faint, lingering aroma of pipe tobacco â€“ a ghostly reminder of the previous tenant, a reclusive poet who'd left behind more than just his scent. This was the office of *The Quill*, a small, independent literary journal nestled in the heart of a crumbling, yet stubbornly charming, Victorian neighborhood in the city of Ashwood.  Mia, its editor-in-chief, felt the weight of its survival, and the fate of its struggling authors, rest squarely on her already overburdened shoulders.
