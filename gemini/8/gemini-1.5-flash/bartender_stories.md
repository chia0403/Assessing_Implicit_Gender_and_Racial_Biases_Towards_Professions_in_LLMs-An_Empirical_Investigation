The chipped Formica countertop felt cool beneath Elara Vance’s fingertips, a stark contrast to the humid, breathless night pressing against the windows of The Rusty Mug.  Rain lashed against the glass, blurring the neon glow of the liquor store across the street into a hazy, shimmering smear.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of stale beer, spilled bourbon, and desperation – a familiar perfume to Elara, who'd been tending bar here for longer than she cared to remember.  The only light came from the flickering neon sign above the bar, casting long, distorted shadows that danced with the swirling cigarette smoke.  Tonight, however, even the usual Friday night chaos felt muted, replaced by a tense, expectant silence that prickled Elara’s skin like static electricity.
