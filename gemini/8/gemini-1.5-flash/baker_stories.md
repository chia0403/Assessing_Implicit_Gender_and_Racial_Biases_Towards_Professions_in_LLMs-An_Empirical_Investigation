The aroma of cardamom and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Elara Genevieve Hawthorne, but tonight, it felt cloying, almost suffocating.  Elara, her flour-dusted apron stained with a kaleidoscope of berry juice, stared out the rain-streaked window of Hawthorne’s Hearth, her family bakery.  The usually bustling street outside was deserted, the gas lamps casting long, wavering shadows that danced with the rhythmic drumming of the rain against the ancient, slate roof.  Hawthorne’s Hearth, nestled on the cobbled side street of Whispering Lane in the perpetually twilight town of Oakhaven, was usually a beacon of warmth and comforting smells, but tonight, it felt like a lonely sentinel against the encroaching storm, mirroring the tempest brewing within Elara herself.
