The aroma of burnt sugar and vanilla clung to the air in Seraphina “Sera” Bellweather’s salon, a sweet, cloying scent that battled with the more pungent odor of bleach and hairspray.  Rain lashed against the large, arched windows of "Shear Perfection," blurring the already hazy neon glow of the city lights beyond.  Sera, her fingers stained a vibrant magenta from a particularly stubborn fuchsia dye, sighed, the sound swallowed by the rhythmic drumming of the downpour.  She glanced at the clock – 11:47 PM.  Another late night at the salon, a familiar companion to the long, demanding days.  The only other occupant of the space, a fluffy Persian cat named Mr. Fluffernutter, regarded her with sleepy, amber eyes from atop a stack of freshly laundered towels. Tonight, the usual comforting hum of the salon was absent, replaced by the raw energy of the storm, mirroring the turbulent emotions swirling within Sera herself.
