The biting November wind whipped across the cracked asphalt of the abandoned schoolyard, carrying with it the scent of damp leaves and the faint, metallic tang of rust.  Fallen oaks, their branches skeletal against the bruised purple sky, cast long, skeletal shadows across the neglected basketball court.  The backboard, a warped and splintered relic, hung precariously from a single, rusted support.  This was not the gleaming hardwood of a state-of-the-art arena, but it was home.  Home, at least, for Elias Thorne, head coach of the St. Jude's Hawks, a ragtag team of underdogs with more heart than talent, and a season that hung precariously, much like that backboard, by a single thread.
