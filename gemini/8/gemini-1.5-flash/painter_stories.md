The biting November wind whipped Amelia Katherine “Mel” Ainsworth’s auburn hair across her face as she wrestled the heavy easel into her ramshackle studio.  Salt spray, thick as pea soup, clung to everything, a fine, gritty film coating the weathered clapboard of the building and the skeletal remains of long-dead seabirds scattered across the shingle beach below.  Mel’s studio, perched precariously on the cliff edge overlooking the churning grey expanse of the North Sea, was less a haven of artistic creation and more a testament to her stubborn refusal to leave the only place that truly inspired her – the windswept, unforgiving beauty of the Cornish coast.  Inside, the air was thick with the smell of linseed oil and turpentine, a scent that, despite its harshness, Mel found comforting, a familiar perfume of her solitary life.
