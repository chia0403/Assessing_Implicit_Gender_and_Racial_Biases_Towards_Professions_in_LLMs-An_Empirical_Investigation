The chipped porcelain of Mrs. Albright’s antique teacup felt cool against Elara Vance’s fingertips.  Dust motes, illuminated by the weak winter sun slanting through the stained-glass window, danced in the otherwise silent drawing-room of Blackwood Manor.  Elara, her dark hair pulled back in a practical braid, sighed, the sound swallowed by the heavy velvet drapes. Blackwood Manor, perched precariously on a windswept cliff overlooking the churning grey Atlantic, was a beautiful prison.  Its gothic grandeur, usually a source of grim fascination, felt particularly oppressive today, a cold, stony shell reflecting the icy chill in Elara's own heart.  The salty tang of the sea air, usually invigorating, only served to emphasize the isolation, the stark loneliness of her existence within those forbidding walls.
