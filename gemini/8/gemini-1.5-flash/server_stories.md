The chipped Formica tabletop felt clammy beneath Amelia Hernandez’s fingertips.  The fluorescent lights of the “Rosie’s Diner” hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the clatter of cutlery and the sizzle of bacon from the grill.  Steam, thick and greasy, hung in the air, clinging to the faded floral wallpaper and the perpetually sticky menus.  Amelia, a wisp of a girl with eyes the colour of a stormy sea and hair pulled back tight in a practical bun, wiped down the counter with practiced efficiency, the rag leaving streaks of almost-clean on the surface.  Outside, the relentless July sun beat down on the deserted highway, baking the asphalt into shimmering waves.  Inside Rosie’s, it was a different kind of heat – the suffocating blend of stale coffee, frying grease, and simmering resentment that Amelia had come to know intimately over the past three years.
