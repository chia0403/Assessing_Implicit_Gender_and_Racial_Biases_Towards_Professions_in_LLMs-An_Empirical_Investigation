The scent of lavender and old linen hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the biting November wind rattling the single-paned windows of “Stitches & Dreams.”  Inside, nestled amongst bolts of silk the colour of twilight and velvet the shade of a raven’s wing, sat Aurelia Josephine Thistlewick.  Aurelia, or Rellie as most people called her, meticulously pinned a length of emerald green brocade, her brow furrowed in concentration.  The flickering gaslight cast long shadows across her nimble fingers, highlighting the tiny silver thimble perched neatly on her index finger.  Her workshop, situated on the third floor of a rambling Georgian building in the heart of York, was a chaotic haven – a symphony of spools, needles, and half-finished creations vying for space amongst antique sewing machines and overflowing drawers brimming with buttons and lace.  Outside, the cobbled streets echoed with the hurried footsteps of late-afternoon shoppers, a world away from the peaceful sanctuary Rellie had created for herself.
