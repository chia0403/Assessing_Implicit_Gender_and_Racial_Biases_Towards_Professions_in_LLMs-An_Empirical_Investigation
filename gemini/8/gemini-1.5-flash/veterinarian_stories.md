The biting wind whipped off the churning grey sea, stinging Dr. Eleanor Vance’s cheeks as she wrestled the heavy canvas tarp from a battered crate.  Salt spray, thick as pea soup, plastered her already wind-blown auburn hair to her forehead.  The air hung thick with the smell of brine, diesel, and something indefinably…fishy, a scent that usually calmed her but tonight only served to heighten the knot of anxiety twisting in her stomach.  The remote, windswept island of Aisling, population 312 (give or take a few puffins), wasn't exactly known for its vibrant veterinary practice, but tonight's emergency call had been particularly cryptic.  The message, left on her battered, barely-functioning satellite phone, had simply read:  "Urgent.  Unusual patient.  North Cove. Midnight."  Eleanor shivered, pulling her thick wool coat tighter. Midnight was fast approaching, and the only light visible was the lonely, flickering beam from the Aisling lighthouse, a skeletal finger pointing accusingly at the turbulent sky.
