His worn Stetson, low over his eyes, did little to shield him from the relentless glare.  The air hung heavy with the scent of dry grass and the faint, metallic tang of blood – a scent that sent a shiver down his spine even before he saw it.  A lone, dark shape lay sprawled near the watering hole, barely visible against the deepening twilight.
