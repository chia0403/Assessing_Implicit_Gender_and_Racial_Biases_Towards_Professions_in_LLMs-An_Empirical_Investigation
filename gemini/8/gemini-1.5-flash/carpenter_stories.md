The rasp of Elias Thorne's plane sang a mournful tune, a counterpoint to the relentless shriek of the gulls wheeling overhead.  Salt spray, thick as a shroud, clung to everything in the small, ramshackle workshop perched precariously on the cliffs overlooking the churning grey expanse of the North Sea.  The wind, a constant companion in this windswept corner of Cornwall, howled through the gaps in the aged timber framing, threatening to rip the entire structure from its moorings.  Inside, Elias, his face weathered and lined like the ancient oak he was currently shaping, worked with a grim determination, the rhythmic scrape of his tools the only sound louder than the ocean's roar.  The air hung thick with the scent of sawdust, brine, and woodsmoke â€“ a pungent perfume that spoke of both hardship and resilience, much like Elias Thorne himself.
