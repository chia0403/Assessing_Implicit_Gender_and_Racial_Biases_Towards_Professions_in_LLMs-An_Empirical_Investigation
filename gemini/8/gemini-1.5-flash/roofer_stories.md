The biting November wind whipped Elias Thorne’s already-chapped lips raw as he wrestled another bundle of asphalt shingles onto the precarious scaffolding.  Below, the sprawling Victorian mansion of Mrs. Eleanor Ainsworth loomed, a gothic behemoth of decaying grandeur clinging precariously to the cliff edge overlooking the churning grey expanse of the Atlantic.  Sea spray, driven by a gale that threatened to tear the shingles from his grasp, peppered his face with icy droplets.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and the faint, almost imperceptible aroma of woodsmoke from a distant chimney, tasted of salt and impending doom.  Elias, a seasoned roofer with calloused hands and eyes the colour of a stormy sea, shifted his weight, the rhythmic creak of the scaffolding a constant, unsettling counterpoint to the howl of the wind.  He’d seen a lot of storms in his forty years, but this one felt…different.  It felt like it held a warning.
