The scent of old paper and exotic spices hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume unique to Amelia Hawthorne’s travel agency, "Wanderlust & Co."  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sunbeams slicing through the tall, arched windows of her shop, illuminating the cluttered, yet somehow charming, interior.  Maps, faded and creased like ancient parchments, spilled from overflowing drawers and draped across walls painted a vibrant, almost unsettling shade of turquoise.  Miniature Eiffel Towers, miniature pyramids, and miniature Buddhas – a testament to Amelia's countless travels – jostled for space on every available surface, alongside overflowing baskets of postcards and brochures promising adventures in far-flung corners of the globe.  Outside, the grey drizzle of a London November mirrored the melancholy currently settling over Amelia’s heart, a stark contrast to the vibrant escapades her job usually conjured.
