The rasping cough that clawed its way up Elias Thorne's throat was as familiar as the smell of sun-baked earth and ripening wheat.  Dust, the fine, ochre dust of the Arizona desert, coated his calloused hands and clung to the worn denim of his overalls like a second skin.  The sun, a malevolent eye in the brassy sky, beat down on the parched land, baking the already brittle soil to a near-lethal hardness.  Elias squinted, his gaze sweeping across his family's failing farm, Thorne's Bounty – a cruel irony, considering the stingy yield this year’s crop promised.  The ancient cottonwoods, usually shimmering with a lush green canopy, were skeletal things, their leaves browned and curled at the edges, mirroring the desperation tightening Elias's own chest.  This wasn't just a dry spell; it felt like a curse, a slow, relentless erosion of everything he held dear.
