The chipped paint on the windowsill felt rough beneath Seraphina "Sera" Lancaster's fingertips as she stared out at the relentless grey of the November sky.  Rain lashed against the leaded glass, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  This wasn't just any derelict Victorian mansion; it was *the* Blackwood Manor, notorious throughout Ashworth for its scandalous history and even more scandalous owner, the reclusive Lord Ashworth himself.  Its crumbling grandeur, a symphony of peeling wallpaper, cracked plaster, and dust-laden antiques, was usually the kind of challenge Sera relished.  But this time, the weight of the house, the palpable sense of sorrow clinging to its decaying bones, felt different.  It pressed down on her, a suffocating blanket woven from years of unspoken tragedies.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and something else...something faintly metallic, like old blood.  And Sera, despite her years spent transforming the lives of others through interior design, felt utterly and completely unprepared.
