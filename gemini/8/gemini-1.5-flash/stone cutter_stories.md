The rasp of granite against steel echoed through the cavernous workshop, a sound as familiar to Elias Thorne as his own heartbeat.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single, flickering oil lamp hanging from the raftered ceiling, danced in the air like restless spirits.  Elias, his face grimy and streaked with sweat, worked with a practiced rhythm, the chisel a blur in his calloused hands.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and sharp stone, a perfume he’d inhaled since he was a boy, learning the trade from his father in this very workshop, nestled deep within the shadowed cliffs overlooking the churning grey expanse of the Whispering Sea.  Outside, the relentless wind howled a mournful song, a counterpoint to the rhythmic percussion of Elias’s craft. This workshop, carved from the living rock itself, had been the Thorne family's legacy for generations, a legacy Elias now carried on his strong, capable shoulders, a legacy that was about to be tested like never before.
