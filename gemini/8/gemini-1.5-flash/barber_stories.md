The scent of Bay Rum and stale coffee hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, proprietor of Butterfield's Barber Shop. Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grime-coated window of his shop, illuminating the swirling chaos of his workspace.  Shears, combs, and straight razors lay scattered across the worn mahogany countertop, alongside a half-empty bottle of Wild Cherry soda and a chipped mug stained the color of old blood.  Outside, the relentless rhythm of the city – the screech of tires, the rumble of distant sirens, and the incessant chatter of unseen crowds – formed a muted backdrop to the quiet hum of Barty's electric clippers.  It wasn't a glamorous life, but it was his.  And today, it was about to get a whole lot more complicated.
