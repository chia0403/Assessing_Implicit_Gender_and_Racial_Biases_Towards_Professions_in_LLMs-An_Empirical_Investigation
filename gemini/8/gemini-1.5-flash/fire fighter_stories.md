The acrid bite of smoke, thick and greasy with the scent of burning plastic, clawed at Captain Evelyn "Evie" Reed's throat.  She coughed, the sound swallowed by the roar of the inferno consuming the old textile mill on the edge of Grimsborough.  Flames, orange and malevolent, licked at the crumbling brick walls, their hungry dance reflected in the slick, obsidian surface of the water-logged street below.  Rain lashed down, a relentless grey curtain against the fiery spectacle, turning the cobblestones into a treacherous, churning river.  The air hung heavy with the scent of soaked wool and the metallic tang of blood â€“ a grim reminder of the two trapped workers still unaccounted for inside.  This wasn't just another blaze; this was Grimsborough's legacy going up in smoke.
