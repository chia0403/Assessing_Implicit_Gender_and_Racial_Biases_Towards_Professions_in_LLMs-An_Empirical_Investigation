The chipped paint of Dr. Eleanor Vance's waiting room seemed to sigh in the late afternoon sun, filtering through the dusty lace curtains.  Dust motes, illuminated like tiny galaxies, danced in the shafts of light.  The air hung heavy with the scent of old paper and something faintly floral, a desperate attempt to mask the underlying aroma of stale coffee and anxiety.  Eleanor Vance, PhD, a woman whose own carefully constructed composure often felt as fragile as those lace curtains, adjusted the small jade elephant on her desk, a talisman against the inevitable emotional storms that would soon batter her quiet sanctuary.  The clock on the wall ticked with a measured, almost mocking regularity, counting down the seconds until her next appointment â€“ a young man named Thomas Ashton, whose file promised a particularly thorny tangle of issues.
