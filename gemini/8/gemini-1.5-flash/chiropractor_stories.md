The salt spray stung Dr. Eleanor Vance's face as she wrestled with the stubborn canvas awning of her clinic, "Coastal Chiropractic," the wind threatening to rip it from its moorings.  The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum against the churning grey of the Atlantic, cast long shadows across the weathered clapboard building perched precariously on the edge of Seabrook Cove, Maine.  Seabrook itself was a town clinging to the cliffs like barnacles to a ship's hull â€“ a collection of charmingly ramshackle houses, fishing boats bobbing gently in the harbor, and the ever-present scent of brine and pine.  The air, thick with the promise of an approaching storm, carried the cries of gulls overhead and the mournful moan of the waves crashing against the rocks below.  Eleanor, her auburn hair escaping its braid to whip around her face, finally secured the awning, a small victory against the overwhelming power of the ocean and the increasingly ominous sky.  Inside, the warmth of the clinic, smelling faintly of arnica and eucalyptus, offered a stark contrast to the wildness outside.  But even the comforting aroma couldn't quite mask the tension that had settled over her, a feeling heavier than the impending storm.
