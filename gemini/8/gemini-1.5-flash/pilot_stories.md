The biting Antarctic wind howled a mournful symphony around Captain Evelyn Grace Holloway as she wrestled the joystick of the Twin Otter.  Ice crystals, sharp as shards of glass, stung her face exposed despite the balaclava.

The air crackled with static, the radio spitting out a distorted message from McMurdo Station, a distant speck of human activity swallowed by the brutal, indifferent beauty of the continent.  Evelyn squinted through the frosted windscreen, her breath misting in the frigid cockpit.  This was no ordinary supply run; this was a rescue, and the clock was ticking down faster than the mercury in her altimeter.
