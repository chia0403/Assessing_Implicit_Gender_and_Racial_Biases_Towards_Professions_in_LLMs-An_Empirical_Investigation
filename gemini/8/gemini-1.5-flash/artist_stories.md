The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face as he wrestled his easel onto the unsteady deck of the *Seraphina*.  The small fishing trawler pitched and rolled beneath him, a chaotic dance on the churning grey expanse of the North Sea.  Elias, a man whose hands were more accustomed to the delicate strokes of a brush than the rough grip of a rope, clutched at the canvas, its surface already speckled with the erratic splatters of seagull droppings and the ever-present threat of more.  The wind, a howling banshee, threatened to tear the oils from their moorings, leaving behind only a blank, unforgiving white.  This, however, was precisely the chaos Elias sought.  He needed the raw, untamed energy of the storm to capture the tempestuous heart of the sea, to translate its fury onto the canvas before him.  The lighthouse on the distant craggy island of Grimsey flickered intermittently, a defiant spark against the encroaching gloom.  It was a scene that promised not only a challenging painting, but perhaps, a masterpiece.
