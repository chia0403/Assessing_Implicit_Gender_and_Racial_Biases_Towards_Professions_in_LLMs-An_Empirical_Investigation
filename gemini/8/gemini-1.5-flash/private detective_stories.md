The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Jack Stratton's office, a relentless percussion that mirrored the throbbing headache behind his eyes.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale cigarettes and cheap coffee, a familiar aroma that clung to the peeling paint and worn leather of his mismatched furniture like a second skin.  Jack, or “Jackhammer” as some less-than-grateful clients had nicknamed him, sat hunched over a chipped Formica desk, the flickering neon sign of the “Lucky Dragon” Chinese takeaway casting an anemic glow on his weary face.  Outside, the neon signs of Chinatown bled into the inky blackness of a Seattle night, a labyrinth of alleyways and shadowed doorways promising both opportunity and danger in equal measure.  The only light in his cramped office came from the sputtering desk lamp illuminating the crumpled photograph before him – a woman with eyes that held a storm of unspoken sorrow, her face a mask of quiet desperation.  This was his latest case, and it smelled far worse than stale coffee.
