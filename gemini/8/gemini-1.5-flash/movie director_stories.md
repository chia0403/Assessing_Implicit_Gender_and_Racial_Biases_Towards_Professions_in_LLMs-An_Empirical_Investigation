The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Mia” Davenport’s auburn hair across her face as she surveyed the desolate, windswept landscape.  Grey, churning clouds hung low over the skeletal branches of the ancient oak trees, mirroring the turmoil brewing inside her.  The only sound louder than the wind was the rhythmic crash of waves against the jagged cliffs of the Cornish coast, a relentless percussion track accompanying the silent drama unfolding before her.  This wasn’t some picturesque postcard vista; it was the location for her most ambitious project yet, a gothic thriller titled *The Serpent’s Kiss*, and already, it felt cursed.  The ramshackle manor house, perched precariously on the cliff edge, looked less like a home and more like a decaying skull, its empty windows like dark sockets staring out at the unforgiving sea.  Mia shivered, pulling her thick wool coat tighter, the damp chill seeping into her bones despite the layers.  This was going to be a long shoot.
