The chill wind, thick with the scent of woodsmoke and brine, whipped at Bartholomew "Barty" Buttercup's apron as he hauled a side of beef onto the chopping block.  Barty, proprietor of Buttercup's Best Cuts, squinted at the pale morning light struggling to pierce the gloom of Oakhaven's market square.  Oakhaven itself clung precariously to the cliffside, a jumble of slate-roofed houses and cobbled lanes tumbling down towards the churning grey sea below.  The salty air carried the cries of gulls and the distant rumble of the ocean, a constant, rhythmic counterpoint to the clang of Barty's cleaver, a sound as familiar to Oakhaven's inhabitants as the tide itself.  This morning, however, the usual cheerful bustle of the market was muted, a strange quiet hanging heavy in the air, broken only by the mournful creak of the old wooden gallows that stood sentinel at the edge of the square, a stark reminder of Oakhaven's harsher realities.
