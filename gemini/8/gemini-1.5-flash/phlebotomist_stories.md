The fluorescent lights of the Meadowbrook Medical Clinic hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Elara Vanceâ€™s otherwise silent morning.  Elara, a phlebotomist with hands as steady as a surgeon's and a smile that could disarm even the most needle-phobic patient, adjusted the worn elastic band on her upper arm, a familiar comfort in the sterile environment.  The scent of antiseptic and faintly metallic blood hung in the air, a perfume she'd grown accustomed to, yet still found slightly unsettling after eight years on the job.  Rain lashed against the panoramic windows overlooking the sprawling, autumnal landscape of the Connecticut countryside, a stark contrast to the controlled chaos within the clinic's small, perpetually understaffed phlebotomy room.  Today, however, the chaos felt particularly pronounced.  Three patients were already waiting, each a unique challenge in their own right, their anxieties radiating outward like heat waves from a faulty machine.  Elara took a deep breath, reminding herself of the mantra she'd developed over the years: *Find the vein, draw the blood, make them feel better.  Repeat.*
