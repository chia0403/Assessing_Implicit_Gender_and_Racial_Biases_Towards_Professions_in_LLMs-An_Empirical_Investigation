The scent of vanilla bean and almond extract hung heavy in the air, a sweet, almost cloying perfume that clung to everything in Aurelia “Rel” Hawthorne’s tiny shop, “Sugarplum Dreams.” Dust motes danced in the afternoon sunbeams slanting through the grimy windowpanes, illuminating the swirling chaos of her workspace.  Rel, her hands dusted with a fine layer of powdered sugar, meticulously piped delicate buttercream roses onto a three-tiered wedding cake the size of a small child.  The cake itself, a masterpiece of ivory fondant, stood proudly on a rotating turntable, a silent testament to Rel’s considerable talent, even if the chipped paint on the turntable itself hinted at a less-than-perfect budget.  Outside, the relentless rhythm of the city – the insistent honking of taxis and the distant wail of a siren – faded into a muffled hum, swallowed by the sugary sweetness within the walls of Sugarplum Dreams.
