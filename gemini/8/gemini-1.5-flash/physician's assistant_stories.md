The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s hair across her face as she hurried down the cobbled street, the collar of her thick wool coat pulled high.  The air, thick with the scent of woodsmoke and brine, carried the mournful cry of gulls overhead.  She tugged her worn leather satchel tighter against her hip, its contents – a battered stethoscope, a well-thumbed medical textbook, and a half-eaten apple – jostling against each other.  The gas lamps flickered intermittently, casting long, dancing shadows that stretched and distorted the already gothic architecture of Port Blossom, a small, isolated fishing village clinging precariously to the rugged coastline of Maine.  Amelia, a physician’s assistant with a reputation for both skill and a stubborn streak wider than the Atlantic, was late.  Again.  And this time, the consequences might be more serious than a missed cup of tea with Mrs. Gable and her prize-winning marmalade.
