The biting wind whipped at Sergeant Valerius Thorne's cloak, a ragged thing of once-fine wool now stiff with frozen rain.  He hunched deeper into it, the collar scratching at his frost-chapped neck, and stamped his feet against the icy cobblestones of the Citadel’s outer wall.  The grey stone, slick with meltwater, reflected the equally grey, bruised sky above.  A lone raven, black as a pit of despair, circled lazily overhead, its harsh cry echoing the bleakness of the landscape.  Valerius, a man whose face was as weathered and worn as the ancient stones around him, gripped his halberd tighter, its cold steel a small comfort against the pervasive chill – both physical and emotional – that permeated the desolate outpost of Fort Argentum.  The fort, perched precariously on the windswept cliffs overlooking the Whispering Sea, was as isolated and unforgiving as the land itself, a lonely sentinel against whatever lurked beyond the horizon.
