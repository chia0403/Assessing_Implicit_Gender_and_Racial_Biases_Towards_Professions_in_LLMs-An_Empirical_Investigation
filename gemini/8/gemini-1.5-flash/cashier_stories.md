The fluorescent lights of "Quick Stop & Shop" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Elara Vance's Tuesday afternoon.  Elara, meticulously arranging a display of suspiciously-orange-hued mandarins, could practically feel the hum vibrating in her bones.  The air hung thick with the cloying sweetness of cheap air freshener â€“ something vaguely floral that clashed violently with the lingering scent of stale coffee and slightly-spoiled milk.  Outside, the late October wind howled a mournful counterpoint to the store's internal drone, rattling the already-loose window panes.  Rain lashed against the glass, blurring the already indistinct view of the deserted highway beyond.  Elara sighed, the sound swallowed by the relentless hum of the refrigerators behind her.  Another slow Tuesday at Quick Stop & Shop, another Tuesday spent staring at the chipped paint of the checkout counter.
