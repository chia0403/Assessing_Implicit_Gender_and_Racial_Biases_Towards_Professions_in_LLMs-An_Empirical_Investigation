The flickering neon sign of the "Rusty Mug Saloon" cast an oily, emerald glow across the rain-slicked streets of Dustbowl, Nevada.  A stray dog, ribs showing through its matted fur, shivered under a rusted dumpster, its howls a mournful counterpoint to the rhythmic clang of the city's only functioning streetlight, swaying precariously on its pole.  This was the kind of night that made even hardened souls reach for another shot of something strong.  For Elias "Sparky" Cartwright, however, it was just another Tuesday.  He wrestled a frayed length of wire, the dampness clinging to his calloused hands like a second skin, his breath misting in the chilly desert air.  The job – rewiring the saloon's ancient electrical system – was less than glamorous, but the promise of a hefty payment from the notoriously tight-fisted owner, a man known only as "Big Tony," kept him plugging away.
