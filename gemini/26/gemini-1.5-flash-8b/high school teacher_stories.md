Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Ms. Elara Nightingale's classroom, mimicking the frantic rhythm of her own thoughts.  The stale scent of old textbooks and forgotten lunches clung to the air, a constant reminder of the endless cycle of assignments, quizzes, and the relentless march of the school year.  It was a Tuesday, the kind that felt like a Wednesday and a Thursday all rolled into one.  Her classroom, nestled in the back corner of Willow Creek High, was a mausoleum of organized chaos.  Rows of empty desks, chipped paint, and posters plastered with motivational quotes that looked like they’d been rescued from a particularly depressing Pinterest board, created a stark contrast to the vibrant energy she’d craved to inject into her students.  The flickering fluorescent lights cast long, dancing shadows across the worn linoleum floor, illuminating the faint dust motes that danced in the air, mirroring the uneasy feeling that settled in Elara's stomach.  Outside, the relentless downpour obscured the already muted colours of the autumnal landscape, a perfect visual metaphor for the melancholy that had settled over her this week.
