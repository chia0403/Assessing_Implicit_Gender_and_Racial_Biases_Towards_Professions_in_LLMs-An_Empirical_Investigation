The fluorescent hum of the server room was a constant, almost imperceptible lullaby to Elias Thorne, Systems Analyst at GlobalTech.  Rows upon rows of humming metal cabinets, each a meticulously organized fortress of data, filled the cavernous space.  Dust motes danced in the weak beams of overhead lights, illuminated by the pale glow of thousands of interconnected circuits.  Elias, in his worn, navy blue hoodie and perpetually smudged glasses, moved with the quiet precision of a surgeon among the delicate electronics.  Tonight, however, the lullaby was jarring, a dissonant chord against the usually harmonious symphony of servers.  The hum was punctuated by sporadic, frantic beeps, echoing through the sterile, almost antiseptic space.  The air, usually thick with the scent of ozone and recycled air, now carried a subtle, metallic tang, a metallic tang of fear.  A critical system, responsible for maintaining the delicate balance of GlobalTech's global infrastructure, was failing.
