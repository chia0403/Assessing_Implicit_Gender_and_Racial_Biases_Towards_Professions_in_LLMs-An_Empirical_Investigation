The flickering fluorescent lights of "The Rusty Mug" cast long, skeletal shadows across the worn Formica tables.  Rain hammered against the chipped awning, a relentless percussion that seemed to echo the frantic rhythm of Amelia "Amy" Butterfield's heart.  Tonight, the usual Tuesday night lull had been replaced by a chaotic rush.  The annual "Pre-Fall Festival of Festivities" was in full swing, and the tiny, greasy spoon diner was packed tighter than a sardine can on a ferry.  Amy, a server with eyes the colour of warm caramel and a smile that could melt glaciers, was juggling three overflowing trays of plates, a half-eaten lasagna, and a bewildered customer asking for a "double-espresso-chocolate-caramel milkshake." The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee, frying onions, and desperation.  Outside, the wind howled, threatening to rip the flimsy awning from its moorings.  This was Amy's night.  This was the night she was going to prove she could handle anything.
