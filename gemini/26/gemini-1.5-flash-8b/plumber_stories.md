The flickering neon sign of "Plumbers' Paradise" cast a sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked cobblestones of Old Market Square.  Water, a relentless, insistent percussion, hammered against the corrugated iron awning above, a soundtrack to the city's constant, muted sigh.  Inside, Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, a plumber with grease-stained overalls and a perpetually surprised expression, wrestled with a stubborn drainpipe.  It was a Tuesday, one of those grey days that seemed to cling to the city like a damp shroud, and the air hung thick with the smells of mildew and brewing coffee from the nearby stalls.  Barty, despite the relentless drizzle and the pipe's stubborn refusal to cooperate, hummed a jaunty tune, a melody that seemed almost out of place in the gloom of the alleyway.
