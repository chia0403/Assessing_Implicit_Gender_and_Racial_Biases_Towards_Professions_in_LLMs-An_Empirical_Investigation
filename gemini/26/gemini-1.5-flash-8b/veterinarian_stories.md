The biting wind whipped across the jagged peaks of the Aosta Valley, stinging Dr. Elara Nightingale’s cheeks as she squinted at the crumpled figure huddled beneath the icicle-laden branches of a gnarled pine.  The air, thin and crisp, tasted of pine needles and impending snow.  The valley floor, a patchwork of ochre-toned fields and slate-grey mountains, stretched out before her, a breathtakingly beautiful panorama, yet one laced with an unsettling stillness.
