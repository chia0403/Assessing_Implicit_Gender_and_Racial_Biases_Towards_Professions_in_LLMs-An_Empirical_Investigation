The fluorescent lights of the subterranean lab hummed, a monotonous counterpoint to Dr. Eleanor Vance's frantic typing.  Dust motes danced in the beams, illuminating swirling graphs and cryptic equations plastered across her monitor.  The air, thick with the scent of ozone and something vaguely metallic, clung to her like a second skin.  She was in the bowels of the Icarus Institute, a research facility tucked beneath the sprawling metropolis of Neo-Kyoto, a place where the boundaries between science and the unknown blurred faster than her fingers could trace the data.  The year is 2242.
