The scent of sandalwood and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort in the tiny, sun-dappled barbershop of Barnaby "Barty" Butterfield.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grimy window, illuminating a haze of tobacco smoke that clung to the worn wooden chairs.  Barty, a man whose thick, dark hair was always meticulously sculpted into a meticulous quiff, leaned over the back of a creaking, mahogany chair, his sharp eyes scanning the nervous twitch of a young man named Finnigan O'Malley.  The clatter of his clippers was a rhythmic counterpoint to the nervous tapping of Finnigan's fingers on the worn wooden armrest.  The faded floral wallpaper, a testament to a bygone era of bold patterns and pastel hues, struggled to hold its own against the relentless grime. This was the Quiet Corner Barber Shop, tucked away on a back street in the heart of the bustling, yet strangely quiet, city of Emberton.
