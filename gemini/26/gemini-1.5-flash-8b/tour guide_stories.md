The biting wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks as she surveyed the sprawling, grey expanse of the moor.  Below, nestled amongst the skeletal, wind-battered trees, lay the ruins of Blackwood Manor.  A thick, almost tangible fog clung to the valley floor, obscuring the ancient stone walls and twisting pathways that snaked through the overgrown gardens.  This was her third tour of the month, and the eerie silence of the moor, usually punctuated by the distant cries of gulls, was unsettlingly profound.  Amy, a tour guide with a knack for weaving history and a touch of the supernatural into her narratives, felt a shiver run down her spine, a sensation not entirely due to the chill. Something about this particular manor held a palpable sense of unease, an unspoken story whispered on the wind.  Today's tour, she knew, would be different.  Not just different, butâ€¦ *significant*.  The whispers had started, almost a week ago, coming from the local village; they spoke of strange lights flickering in the windows of the manor, of the sound of footsteps echoing through empty halls in the dead of night.  Amy glanced at the weathered signboard advertising the tour: "Blackwood Manor: Echoes of the Past."  The past, she thought, had a tendency to linger, and sometimes, it chose to make its presence known.
