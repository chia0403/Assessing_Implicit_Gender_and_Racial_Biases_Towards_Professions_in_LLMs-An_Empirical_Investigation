The fluorescent lights of the Zenith Drafting Department hummed, a monotonous drone that permeated the air, mixing with the faint scent of stale coffee and the rhythmic *click-clack* of mechanical pencils.  Amelia Petrova, a drafting worker with meticulous, almost painful, attention to detail, hunched over her drafting table, a tangle of blueprints and technical schematics spread before her.  The space, a long, narrow room filled with identical tables, felt sterile, a concrete box designed for precision and efficiency, rather than creativity.  Windows were few, offering only a glimpse of the perpetually overcast cityscape outside.  Rain lashed against the glass, mirroring the relentless pressure Amelia felt to meet the looming deadline for the new Lunar Orbital Assembly blueprints.  This was her life, this cramped, fluorescent-lit space, a symphony of mechanical pencil strokes and the muted anxieties of deadlines.
