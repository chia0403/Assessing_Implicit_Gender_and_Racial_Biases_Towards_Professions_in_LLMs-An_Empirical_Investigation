The fluorescent lights of Ms. Eleanor Vance's office hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *tap-tap-tap* of her pen against the worn, oak desk.  Outside, the relentless November rain hammered against the grimy windowpanes of Northwood High, mirroring the tempest brewing within her.  Rain-slicked leaves, clinging to the branches like tattered banners, whispered secrets in the wind, secrets Eleanor desperately wished she could hear.  Her small office, tucked away on the third floor of the aging school building, felt cramped, stifling, almost suffocating.  The air, thick with the scent of stale coffee and despair, hung heavy in the humid November air.  A single, flickering Christmas-themed lamp sat on her desk, a jarring incongruity against the bleakness.  Students, the living embodiment of anxieties and unspoken fears, filled her schedule throughout the day, seeking solace and guidance in the midst of their own individual storms.  But today, something felt different. The weight in her chest was heavier than usual.  She had a feeling that this was not just another day at Northwood High.
