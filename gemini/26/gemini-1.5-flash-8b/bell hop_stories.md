The humid air hung thick and heavy over the Grand Magnolia Hotel, clinging to the polished mahogany floors and whispering through the ornate crystal chandeliers.  Dust motes, illuminated by the afternoon sun filtering through the stained-glass windows, danced in lazy spirals.  Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, a bell hop with a perpetually surprised expression, stood at the foot of the grand staircase, polishing a brass doorknob with an almost reverent care.  His starched white uniform, though immaculate, seemed to wilt slightly in the oppressive heat.  The aroma of jasmine tea and freshly baked pastries mingled with the faint scent of something almostâ€¦metallic, a scent that lingered in the corners of the lobby like a forgotten promise.
