The flickering neon sign of the Rusty Mug cast a sickly yellow glow over Amelia "Sparrow" Finch's shoulders, painting her already-tanned skin in a ghostly luminescence.  The air hung thick with the smells of stale beer, cheap cigarettes, and something vaguely floral that clung to the air like a phantom.  This was the Rusty Mug, a dive bar nestled in the shadowed alleys of Oldport, a city choked by industry and haunted by whispers of forgotten fortunes.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless percussion that echoed the frantic rhythm of Sparrow's heart as she wiped down the sticky bar.  Every chipped mug, every stained counter, every glint of reflection in the cracked mirror behind the bar held a story, and Sparrow, with her weary eyes and worn hands, listened to them all.  Tonight, however, a new story was beginning, one that wouldn't be told in hushed tones, but screamed in the deafening silence that followed the last, painful chord of a drunken ballad.
