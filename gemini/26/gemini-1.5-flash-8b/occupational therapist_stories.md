The chipped paint on the door of 17 Elm Street seemed to absorb the afternoon sun, mirroring the muted weariness that clung to Amelia Hayes.  Occupational Therapist Amelia Hayes, a woman whose life was a carefully orchestrated symphony of schedules and appointments, found herself unexpectedly stalled.  Not by a demanding client, not by a frustrating insurance company, but by a locked door.

The setting was a quiet, almost forgotten corner of the city, nestled between a sprawling park and a row of Victorian houses that whispered tales of long-ago lives.  Dust motes danced in the late afternoon light filtering through the sparse leaves of the sycamore trees lining the street, painting the narrow road in hues of amber and gold.  The air hung heavy with the scent of pine needles and damp earth, a familiar comfort to Amelia, despite the gnawing anxiety that pulsed beneath the surface of her calm exterior.  She traced a finger along the faded brass handle of the door, the smooth metal a stark contrast to the rough texture of the chipped paint. Inside, according to the paperwork she'd carried for three hours, lay a woman named Eleanor Vance, a patient requiring meticulous care.  But the note, scribbled in hurried script, held a secret Amelia wasn't quite ready to face.
