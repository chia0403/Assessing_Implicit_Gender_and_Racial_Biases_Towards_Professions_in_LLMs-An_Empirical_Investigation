The biting wind whipped across the exposed scaffolding, stinging Elias Thorne's cheeks as he tightened the final bolt on the fourth-story balcony railing.  The grey London sky, a bruised plum against the lowering sun, mirrored the weariness settling in his bones.  Below, the bustling, chaotic streets of the city thrummed with a life he rarely felt a part of.  He was a cog in a machine, a brick in a wall, a small, insignificant piece of this colossal, ever-shifting urban landscape.  Today, however, the relentless rhythm of the construction site felt acutely personal.


The year was 2042.  Elias Thorne, 32, worked for "Apex Structures," a prominent firm specializing in retrofitting and renovating historic London buildings.  The project was a painstaking restoration of the neo-Gothic St. Jude's Church, a landmark with a history shrouded in centuries of whispers and rumour.  Stonework, weathered and intricate, was revealing itself layer by layer, while the scaffolding, a spiderweb of steel and rope, clung to the aged structure like a protective embrace.
