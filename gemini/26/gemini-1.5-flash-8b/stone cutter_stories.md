The biting wind whipped across the jagged peaks of the Cairngorms, stinging Elias Thorne’s cheeks and rattling the loose stones in his apron.  He squinted against the swirling snow, his breath clouding the air around him like a phantom.  Below, the valley floor, a patchwork of grey and white, disappeared into the gathering gloom.  The air itself seemed to press down on him, thick and heavy with the weight of unspoken winter.

Elias Thorne, stone cutter of the Cairngorm Quarries, was not a man accustomed to complaining.  His hands, gnarled and weathered like ancient oak, were more comfortable wielding a chisel than uttering words.  But even Elias felt the chill seep into his very bones, a cold that had nothing to do with the plummeting temperature.  Today, the quarry felt different, haunted by a silence more profound than usual. The rhythmic clang of hammer against stone, the constant murmur of his fellow workers – all had vanished.  Just the wind, howling like a banshee, and the relentless whisper of the mountains.
