The flickering fluorescent lights of the abandoned radio station hummed a mournful tune, a counterpoint to the static crackle emanating from Amelia "Ace" Cartwright's workbench.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of sunlight piercing the grimy window, illuminating layers of solder flux and the faded remnants of graffiti scrawled across the concrete walls.  Ace, her name a testament to her fearless attitude, hunched over a battered, vintage shortwave receiver, her fingers dancing across the intricate network of wires.  The air, thick with the smell of ozone and burnt electronics, was a familiar comfort to her.  This was her sanctuary, this forgotten corner of the world, a testament to her life as a radio technician in the fading heart of the Rust Belt city.  It was here, amidst the decay and whispers of forgotten broadcasts, that she hoped to unearth something more than static.
