Professor Alistair Finch-Hastings, a man whose tweed jacket seemed perpetually dusted with the fine, grey ash of forgotten lectures, stared out the rain-streaked window of his cluttered study.  The London fog, a thick, suffocating blanket, clung to the cobbled streets below, mirroring the oppressive weight pressing down on his shoulders.  His study, a haven of academic disorder, was nestled within the grand, crumbling edifice of St. Anselm's College, a hallowed institution of learning steeped in centuries of whispered secrets and forgotten glories.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon light slicing through the gloom, illuminating stacks of meticulously annotated texts, half-finished manuscripts, and an overflowing ceramic teacup.  The air, thick with the scent of old paper and decaying mahogany, hummed with the silent, almost imperceptible, creak of the aging building.  Outside, the rhythmic drumming of rain against the windowpanes provided a constant, melancholic soundtrack to the professor's burgeoning unease.
