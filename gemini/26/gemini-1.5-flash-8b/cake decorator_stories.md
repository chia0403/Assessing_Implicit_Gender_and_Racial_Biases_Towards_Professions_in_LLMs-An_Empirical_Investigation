The chipped porcelain sink, stained a faded ochre from years of lukewarm soapy water and crushed almond paste, reflected the flickering gaslight above Amelia Nightingaleâ€™s head.  Dust motes danced in the single beam, illuminating the intricate sugar-paste roses she was meticulously arranging on a miniature wedding cake.  The air, thick with the sweet, cloying scent of vanilla and icing sugar, hung heavy in the tiny, cramped bakery.  Outside, the rhythmic clatter of horse-drawn carriages echoed through the cobbled streets of Victorian London, a symphony of city life that felt both distant and strangely pervasive within the hushed confines of the workshop.  Amelia, her fingers stained a delicate shade of pale pink, concentrated on the delicate swirls of the frosting, each tiny flourish a silent prayer for the couple whose union she was helping to craft.  It was a small, delicate slice of happiness she was painstakingly constructing, one that felt increasingly important in a world that often seemed to crumble around her.
