The fluorescent lights of the "Apex Legal" office hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia Nightingale's life.  Dust motes danced in the pale morning light filtering through the grimy windowpanes of the second-floor office suite, casting long shadows across the polished reception desk.  Amelia, a woman of thirty-two with eyes that held the weary wisdom of a seasoned bookkeeper, adjusted the chipped ceramic mug in her hand.  The lukewarm coffee offered little solace against the gnawing pre-dawn chill. Another Tuesday. Another avalanche of paperwork, phone calls, and impatient clients.  The smell of stale coffee and anxiety hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume of the legal profession.  Outside, the city stirred, a symphony of honking taxis and the rumble of approaching dawn. Amelia sighed, a quiet whisper lost in the hum of the fluorescent lights, and prepared for the day ahead.
