The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Amelia Blackwood's cottage, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic rhythm of her thoughts.  She hunched deeper into the worn armchair, the flickering gaslight casting long, dancing shadows across the cluttered desk piled high with manuscripts, half-finished stories, and overflowing coffee mugs.

Amelia, author of the critically acclaimed "Whispers of the Withered Woods," felt the familiar, oppressive weight of writer's block pressing down on her, a tangible entity in the otherwise empty room.  The remote Scottish Highlands, usually a source of inspiration, now felt like a suffocating cage.  The biting wind carried with it the ghosts of stories yet untold, the specters of characters yearning for life on the page.
