Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the dilapidated building, a rhythmic drumming that mirrored the frantic pounding in Amelia "Ace" Carmichael's head.  The air hung thick with the smell of mildew and cheap cigarettes, clinging to the musty scent of forgotten memories.  This wasn't Ace's usual office, not the polished mahogany and leather of her more prestigious cases. This was the backroom of "The Rusty Mug," a dive bar on the grimy edge of the city, a place where shadows stretched long and secrets whispered in the dim light. Ace, her trench coat slick with rain, hunched over a chipped Formica table, a half-eaten plate of greasy fries and a half-empty mug of lukewarm coffee providing meager sustenance.  The flickering neon sign of the bar, proclaiming "Whiskey & Whispers," cast an eerie glow on the worn, leather-bound ledger open before her.

**Setting:** The city of Ashwood, a sprawling metropolis built on a forgotten river, its heart pulsating with the undercurrent of industry and hidden deals. The Rusty Mug, tucked away in the industrial district, was a testament to the city's gritty underbelly.  The air hung heavy with the smoke from countless cigarettes, the clank of metal on metal, and the rumble of trucks.   Rain lashed down in sheets, reflecting the cold, hard steel of the city's skeletal infrastructure.
