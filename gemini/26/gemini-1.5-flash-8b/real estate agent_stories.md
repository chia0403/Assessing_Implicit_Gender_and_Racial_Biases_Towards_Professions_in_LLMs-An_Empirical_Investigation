The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwoodâ€™s scarf around her neck, a stark contrast to the gilded interior of the opulent estate she was touring.  Sunlight, fractured by the towering French windows, painted fleeting patterns on the polished parquet floor.

The manor's grand entrance, framed by towering oak trees, suggested a past filled with lavish parties and whispered romances, but the hushed silence, punctuated only by the creaking of ancient timbers, spoke of a present shrouded in mystery.
