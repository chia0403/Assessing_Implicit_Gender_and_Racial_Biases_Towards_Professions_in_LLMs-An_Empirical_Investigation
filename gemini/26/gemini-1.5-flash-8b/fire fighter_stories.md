The biting wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Carmichael's fire-resistant jacket around her as she surveyed the skeletal remains of the old mill.  A swirling vortex of ash and smoke still clung to the air, a ghostly shroud obscuring the once-proud brick facade.  The scent of burnt timber and ozone, a familiar, yet always unsettling, aroma, filled her nostrils.  This was her fourth fire in as many months in the heart of the small, windswept town of Oakhaven, nestled between the whispering pines and the jagged coastline of the Emerald Isle.  A town steeped in history, whispered to hold secrets as old as the timber that now lay shattered beneath the grey sky.

The setting:  Oakhaven, a small, historic coastal town in the Emerald Isle, clinging to the edge of a rugged coastline.  The town, with its weathered grey stone buildings and rambling, ancient trees, was both picturesque and eerily quiet on this particular autumn morning.  The smell of brine and pine needles hung heavy in the air, mingling with the acrid tang of smoke still clinging to the air. The old mill, the heart of the town's once-thriving industry, now lay in ruins, a gaping maw of shattered brick and splintered wood.   A chill wind howled through the decimated structure, carrying with it the murmurings of the sea and the whispers of the past.
