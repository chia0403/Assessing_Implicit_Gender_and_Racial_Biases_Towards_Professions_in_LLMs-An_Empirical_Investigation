The biting wind, a razor-edged shriek, clawed at Amelia Petrova's flight suit as she wrestled the controls of the Falcon 9000.  Below, the jagged peaks of the Himalayas rose like petrified teeth against a bruised, twilight sky.  Snow, the colour of powdered bone, blanketed the world, swallowing the valley villages whole.  Amelia, a seasoned pilot with the Crimson Wings Air Corps, felt the familiar tremor of the powerful engines beneath her, a rhythmic pulse against the icy silence of the high altitude.  This was her patrol route, a treacherous stretch of air known as the Dragon's Tooth, where even the bravest eagles dared not fly without a heart of steel.  Tonight, however, the silence held a different kind of chill, a foreboding hum that resonated with something more than the usual mountainous air currents.  She squinted through the visor, her breath puffing out in white clouds, searching for any sign of the unusual disturbance that had been reported from the isolated monastery nestled within the valley.  The squadron radio crackled, a static-filled whisper, "Falcon 9000, report." Amelia took a deep breath, the oxygen mask a cold comfort against the growing unease.  She knew, with a certainty that sliced through the chilling wind, that tonight's flight would be anything but routine.
