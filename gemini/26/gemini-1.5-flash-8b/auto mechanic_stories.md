The greasy, oily air hung thick in the "Rusty Wrench" garage, a testament to the ceaseless symphony of clanking metal and muttered curses.  Sunlight, fractured and distorted by the grime-coated windows, cast long shadows that danced with the swirling dust motes.  This was the domain of Bartholomew "Barty" Grimshaw, auto mechanic extraordinaire, or as the regulars affectionately (and sometimes not-so-affectionately) called him, "Barty the Bolt-Bender."  Barty, a man whose hands, weathered and calloused like ancient maps, spoke volumes of countless hours spent wrestling with engines, was hunched over a sputtering 1978 Ford Bronco, its once-proud chrome now tarnished and dull.  The Bronco, affectionately nicknamed "Bronco Buster" by Barty's youthful self, was the latest in a long line of vehicles that had graced, and sometimes disgraced, his attention.  Today, however, the Bronco posed a particular challenge.  Its stubborn refusal to ignite, coupled with a faint, acrid smell of burning rubber, suggested something more than a simple carburetor problem.
