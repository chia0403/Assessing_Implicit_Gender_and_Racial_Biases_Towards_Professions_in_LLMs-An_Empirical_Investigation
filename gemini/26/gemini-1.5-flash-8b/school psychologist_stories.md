The fluorescent lights of the Northwood High School counseling center hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Dr. Eleanor Vance's afternoon.  Paperwork, a never-ending tide of anxiety-ridden forms, progress reports, and disciplinary referrals, piled haphazardly on her desk, mirroring the chaotic energy swirling around her.  Today, the air felt thick with unspoken tension.  Rumors, like insidious tendrils, snaked through the hallways, whispers about a new student, a quiet girl named Elara, who'd arrived just a week ago.

Setting: Northwood High School.  A sprawling, brick edifice perched on a hill overlooking the city, its imposing facade masking a complex inner life.  Inside, the hallways echoed with the hurried footsteps of teenagers, the rhythmic thump of lockers, and the sharp crackle of laughter that often masked deeper anxieties. The counseling center, tucked away in a quiet corner of the building, offered a temporary refuge, a space meant for calm, but one that often felt far from it.  The muted colours of the room, beige walls and grey-blue carpeting, did little to soothe the frenetic energy that surrounded Eleanor.  Outside, the city spread out below, a vast tapestry of lights and shadows, a constant reminder of the world beyond the school walls.
