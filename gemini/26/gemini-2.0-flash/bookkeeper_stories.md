The fluorescent lights of "Numbers & Nookies, Accountants Extraordinaire" hummed a monotonous tune, a tune that matched the one playing in Amelia Beatrice Cartwrightâ€™s head. Outside, the late October wind whipped fallen leaves across the deserted parking lot, threatening to rip the garish, inflatable dancing man advertising tax returns right off his moorings. But inside, Amelia was lost in a labyrinth of spreadsheets, each cell a tiny square of financial truth, or at least, the approximation of it. The smell of stale coffee and day-old donuts clung to the air, a fragrant testament to the firm's dedication to, well, not much besides getting the job done. Amelia, perched on her ergonomically-approved chair (which, she privately suspected, was actively plotting against her spine), adjusted her glasses and sighed. Another day, another mountain of receipts to conquer. And tonight? Tonight she had promised herself she'd finally start that Jane Austen re-read. A promise she made most nights, a promise usually broken by the siren call of un-reconciled ledgers.
