Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring an electrician named Evelyn "Evie" Rodriguez:

**Story Opening:**

The hum was subtle, a low thrum vibrating through the floorboards of the old Victorian house like a nervous heartbeat. Evelyn "Evie" Rodriguez, her worn leather tool belt digging comfortably into her hip, paused, wrench mid-tighten. "Definitely not right," she muttered, her breath misting slightly in the unheated attic. Above, the wind howled like a banshee, rattling the stained-glass windows that were, to her untrained eye, probably worth more than her entire truck. She traced the exposed wiring with a cautious finger, the copper dull and green with age. A century's worth of dust, and probably a century's worth of bad choices, coated everything in a thick, unsettling film.

"Okay, Granny Willow," she said aloud to the empty space, forcing a confident tone. "Let's see what you've been hiding." She flipped on her headlamp, its beam cutting through the gloom, and began her investigation.

**Setting:**

The story begins in the drafty, unfinished attic of the Willow Creek Manor, a sprawling Victorian house perched on a windswept bluff overlooking the small, coastal town of Havenwood, Oregon. The house, currently owned by a reclusive, elderly woman named Mrs. Eleanor Willow (hence, 'Granny Willow' in Evie's monologue), is a local landmark, known for its intricate architecture, rumored history of hauntings, and its general state of disrepair.

The attic itself is a cramped, cluttered space filled with forgotten furniture draped in white sheets, cobwebs that shimmer like ghostly lace, and boxes overflowing with yellowed letters, antique dolls with vacant stares, and other relics of the Willow family's past. The air is thick with the scent of dust, mildew, and something elseâ€¦ something faintly metallic and unsettling. The single, small window at the far end of the attic offers a panoramic view of the turbulent Pacific Ocean, but it is currently obscured by grime and the swirling storm raging outside.
