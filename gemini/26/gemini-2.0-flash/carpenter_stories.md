## Opening:

The scent of pine and sawdust, a comforting blanket in the crisp morning air, did little to soothe Arthur Penhaligon's jangled nerves. He traced the grain of the cherry wood with a calloused thumb, the intricate swirl of nature's design a stark contrast to the unsettling knots tightening in his stomach. Today was the day. The day he’d promised to deliver the crib. And the day, if the rumors whispering through the village were true, that everything he thought he knew about Lost Cove would change forever. He took a deep breath, the familiar fragrance of his workshop a temporary balm. He had a job to do, and Arthur Penhaligon, carpenter and reluctant resident of Lost Cove, always finished what he started.

## Setting:

Arthur’s workshop, aptly named "Penhaligon's Handcrafted," was a small, single-story building nestled on the edge of Lost Cove, Maine. The salty tang of the Atlantic Ocean permeated the air, even filtered through the tightly-fitted panes of the shop's large, south-facing window. Inside, a controlled chaos reigned. Chisels, saws, and planes of every imaginable size hung neatly on the wall, casting long, dancing shadows in the morning light. Scraps of wood – oak, maple, cedar, and the ever-present pine – littered the floor, like fallen leaves in a vibrant forest. The air thrummed with the low hum of the bandsaw, a constant companion to Arthur's solitary craft. Outside, Lost Cove was a picturesque postcard come to life. Weather-beaten cottages clustered around a small, protected harbor, where colorful fishing boats bobbed gently in the water. Seagulls shrieked overhead, their cries echoing the ancient secrets held within the craggy cliffs that guarded the village from the relentless embrace of the sea. It was a place of stark beauty and unwavering tradition, a place where change came slowly, if at all. A place where newcomers were met with wary eyes and a knowing silence. And a place where Arthur, despite his efforts, never quite felt like he belonged.
