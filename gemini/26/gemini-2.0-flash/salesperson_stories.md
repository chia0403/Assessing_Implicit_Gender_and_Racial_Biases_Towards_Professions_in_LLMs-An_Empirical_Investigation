The stale air of the conference room hung thick with the ghosts of lukewarm coffee and disappointed dreams. Fluorescent lights buzzed a monotonous hymn above a sea of vacant expressions, reflecting off the glossy brochures scattered on the long, mahogany table. Outside, the Seattle drizzle painted the Puget Sound a mournful grey, mirroring the sinking feeling in Penelope Astrid Bellweather's stomach. 

Penelope, dressed in a sharp but now slightly rumpled navy blue suit, tried to ignore the relentless ticking of the clock on the wall. It was 4:57 PM. Three minutes until she faced the music. Three minutes until she had to explain to Mr. Davies, the Regional Sales Manager, exactly how she’d managed to land zero – not one, not a single – new accounts this quarter.

The setting was the corporate headquarters of "Cascadia Coastal Commodities," a mid-sized distributor of sustainably sourced seafood. Their office, nestled on Pier 70, boasted panoramic views usually reserved for high-end restaurants, but today, those views felt mocking. Penelope loved her city, and she believed in the company's mission, but right now, she felt like she was drowning in the same murky depths they were supposed to be harvesting from.
