## Story Opening:

The chipped ceramic mug warmed Dr. Eleanor Beatrice Davies' hands as she stared out the window, watching the November rain lash against the frosted panes of her office. It was a Tuesday, typically a busy day, but a cancellation had left her with an unexpected pocket of quiet. Not that she minded. The quiet, that is. The cancellation, courtesy of a sudden panic attack on Mrs. Abernathy's part, left a lingering unease in the air, a phantom echo of choked breaths and tearful confessions. Eleanor took a slow sip of her lukewarm Earl Grey, the bitter tang doing little to soothe the knot that had formed in her stomach.

**Setting:**

Eleanor's office was located on the second floor of a converted Victorian house in the quiet, tree-lined borough of Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia. The building itself housed a small collective of therapists, a chiropractor, and a holistic nutritionist. It was a space designed for healing, for gentle introspection. Eleanor's individual office reflected this aesthetic. Soft, muted colors adorned the walls - a pale sage green above a chair rail painted a calming cream. A comfortable, oversized armchair and a plush loveseat faced each other across a thick, hand-woven rug. The furniture was well-worn, comforting in its familiarity. Bookshelves crammed with volumes on psychology, philosophy, and even a surprising selection of poetry lined one wall. A small, antique desk sat tucked away in a corner, usually cluttered with paperwork, a half-finished crossword puzzle, and a small, framed photograph of Eleanor as a child, grinning gap-toothed beside her father in a sunny flower garden. Sunlight, when it managed to pierce the perpetual Philadelphia gloom, filtered through the sheer curtains, casting a soft, forgiving light on the room. Today, however, only the soft glow of a Tiffany-style lamp illuminated the space, casting long, dancing shadows on the walls.
