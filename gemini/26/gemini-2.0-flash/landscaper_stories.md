## Story Opening:

The humid Georgia air hung heavy, thick with the scent of honeysuckle and freshly cut St. Augustine grass. Bartholomew "Bart" Finch wiped a bead of sweat from his brow, leaving a smudge of dirt across his forehead. He squinted at the meticulously sculpted boxwoods that lined the driveway of the Oakhaven Estate, a sprawling antebellum mansion that seemed to loom out of the Spanish moss-draped oaks. He’d been landscaping here for nearly five years, a feat that, in Bart's opinion, deserved a medal of honor. Not for the landscaping itself, which he loved, but for enduring Mrs. Adelaide Beauregard Oakhaven, the estate's owner and resident gargoyle, every single week. Today, however, the usual anxiety wasn't churning in his stomach. Something was different. The air crackled with a low, almost imperceptible hum, and even the normally boisterous cicadas seemed to have gone silent. A shiver snaked down Bart's spine despite the oppressive heat. He took a deep breath, tightened his grip on his pruning shears, and muttered under his breath, "Alright, Bart. Just another Tuesday. Just another pruning." But deep down, he knew this wasn't just another Tuesday at Oakhaven Estate.

## Setting:

**Location:** Oakhaven Estate, a sprawling antebellum mansion located just outside Savannah, Georgia. The estate encompasses several acres, including formal gardens, pecan groves, and a winding dirt road leading to the main house. The air is thick with humidity and the scent of Southern flora – honeysuckle, magnolia, and jasmine.

**Time:** A Tuesday afternoon in late July. The sun is high in the sky, casting long shadows across the manicured lawns.

**Atmosphere:** The atmosphere is both beautiful and unsettling. The estate is undeniably picturesque, with its grand architecture and lush greenery, but there's also a sense of age, history, and maybe even something more… sinister lurking beneath the surface. The silence, punctuated only by the occasional bird call, is unnerving. The air feels heavy and charged.
