Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a graphic designer named Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne:

**Setting:** A cramped, but stylishly chaotic studio apartment overlooking the perpetually gridlocked I-405 in Los Angeles. The walls are plastered with tear sheets from magazines, vintage concert posters, and half-finished mood boards. Sunlight, filtered through a sheer, paint-splattered curtain, illuminates dust motes dancing in the air. Empty coffee mugs and discarded paper sketches litter the surface of a large drafting table.

**Opening:**

The shrill, synthetic warble of the alarm ripped Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne from a dream about sentient Pantone swatches trying to unionize. She groaned, blindly flailing for her phone on the nightstand, knocking over a precarious stack of design magazines in the process. The magazines landed with a soft *thump*, a sound that barely registered over the cacophony of the I-405 outside her window. 6:00 AM. Too early. Always too early.

Amelia finally managed to silence the alarm and flopped back onto her mismatched collection of throw pillows, staring at the cracked plaster ceiling. Another day, another deadline looming. Today, it was the redesigned logo for "Kween Krispy's Kreme," a donut chain aspiring to a level of Instagram fame that Amelia secretly found terrifying. She dragged a hand across her face, feeling the familiar grit of dried-up art marker. Maybe, just maybe, if she buried herself deep enough in bezier curves and color palettes, she could forget about the existential dread that came with living in a city fueled by dreams and desperation. But probably not. Today was definitely going to be a triple-shot-espresso kind of day.
