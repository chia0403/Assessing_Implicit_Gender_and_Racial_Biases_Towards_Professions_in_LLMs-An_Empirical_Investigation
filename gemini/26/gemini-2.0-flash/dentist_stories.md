## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The oppressive humidity hung thick and heavy in the air, a sticky blanket draped over Savannah, Georgia in the heart of a sweltering July. Spanish moss, usually a romantic drape, clung lifelessly to the ancient oak trees lining Forsyth Park, mirroring the weary residents who sought meager respite from the heat. The air conditioning unit in Dr. Eleanor Abigail Ainsworth's office, a converted townhouse on Jones Street, hummed a mournful tune, barely keeping pace with the outside temperature.

**Opening:** The scream, sharp and piercing, sliced through the hum of the air conditioner and the gentle jazz Eleanor usually played to soothe anxious patients. It came from Examining Room B, where she was about to begin a root canal on Mrs. Hemmings, a sweet, albeit notoriously jumpy, elderly woman with a mouth full of regrets and deteriorating molars. Eleanor’s heart hammered against her ribs. It wasn't Mrs. Hemmings’ scream. This was a scream born of terror, a primal sound that resonated deep within Eleanor’s own bones, sending a shiver crawling down her spine despite the stifling heat. She tossed down the gleaming probe she’d been holding, the metal clattering against the stainless steel tray, a jarring counterpoint to the silence that followed. "Darn," she muttered, pushing her reading glasses higher on her nose. "This day just keeps getting… stranger." And as she cautiously made her way towards Examining Room B, the scent of burnt sugar, thick and cloying, filled her nostrils, a scent that triggered a memory, a half-forgotten nightmare from her childhood, a nightmare that had no place in a dental office on a sweltering Savannah afternoon.
