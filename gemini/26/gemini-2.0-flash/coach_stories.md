Okay, here's a story opening and setting focusing on a coach:

**Story Opening:**

The squeak of Nikes on polished wood echoed in the cavernous gym, a sound that both soothed and irritated Eleanor Abigail "Ellie" McMillan.  She’d heard it a million times, each squeak a footfall towards victory, or, more often these days, towards a painful, disappointing loss.  The air, thick with the ghosts of sweat and teenage angst, felt heavy against her skin, like a damp wool blanket on a summer day.  She blew a stray strand of greying blonde hair from her face and consulted the clipboard clutched in her hand, the worn edges a testament to years spent scribbling drills and pep talks that didn't always translate into points on the scoreboard.  Tonight, though, the weight felt heavier than usual.  Tonight, the squeaks weren’t just footsteps.  They were the relentless ticking of a clock, counting down to something big, something *different*, that hung in the air like a poorly thrown free throw.  The whispers had started weeks ago, growing louder with each missed shot and each blown coverage. Whispers of “maybe it’s time,” whispers about new blood, whispers that threatened to drown out even the most enthusiastic cheerleader's cry.

**Setting:**

The story is primarily set in the gymnasium of Northwood High School, a public school nestled in the small, blue-collar town of Oakhaven, Ohio. The gym, known locally as "The Cage," is a relic of the school's past glory, built in the 1970s and showing its age.  The paint on the walls is peeling, revealing patches of faded blue and gold, the school colors.  The bleachers, scarred with years of teenage boredom, creak ominously when filled.  Championship banners, some dating back decades, hang precariously from the rafters, a constant reminder of the school's once-dominant basketball program. Outside the gym doors is a trophy case filled with dusty trophies, all gathering cobwebs. The overall feel is one of a town struggling to hold onto its past while facing an uncertain future, a sentiment mirrored in Ellie's own situation.
