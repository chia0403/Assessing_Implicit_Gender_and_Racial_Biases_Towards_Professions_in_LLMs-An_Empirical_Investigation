The chipped porcelain mug, lukewarm and stained with the ghosts of countless coffees, trembled slightly in Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins' hand. Outside, the early morning Richmond, Virginia sun was just beginning to pry its way through the perpetual haze hanging over Broad Street, a dull, orange glow that did little to illuminate the dust motes dancing in the air of "Bart's Barbershop."

Bart had inherited it from his grandfather, a man whose legendary mustache could rival a walrus. Now, after thirty years of wielding clippers and trading anecdotes, Bart was starting to feel like he was becoming part of the worn leather of the barber chair, part of the faded wallpaper depicting scenes of clipper ships braving tempestuous seas, part of the very fabric of Broad Street itself. He took a long sip of the tepid coffee, the silence of the shop before the day's onslaught of clients – lawyers needing a sharp trim before court, students craving a trendy fade, and the usual assortment of neighborhood characters – a fragile peace he knew wouldn't last. Today, however, felt different. The air hung heavier, the street noise sounded muted, and a strange presentiment, as sharp as the strop he used on his straight razor, tugged at the edges of his mind. Something was coming. And Bartholomew Higgins, the unassuming barber of Broad Street, was about to be caught in its wake.
