## Story Opening:

The scent of sweat and over-ripe bananas hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Bethany Mae Collier. She gripped the microphone tighter, her voice a cheerful shout battling the thumping bass of "Eye of the Tiger." "Alright, Super Squad! Let's feel that burn! Eight more reps, chest to floor! You got this! Remember your form, people, nobody wants a herniated disc on a Tuesday morning!"

Bethany's smile was plastered on, a practiced expression that could convince even the most cynical office worker that burpees were, in fact, a joyful experience. Inside, however, a small, gnawing doubt was taking root. She'd been saying the same lines, playing the same songs, and leading the same grueling workout routines for three years now. Three years of shouting encouragement into sweaty faces, and all she had to show for it was a permanently hoarse voice and a recurring twinge in her left knee.

As Mrs. Gable, a vision in leopard print leggings and a determined frown, struggled with the last push-up, Bethany caught a glimpse of her own reflection in the mirrored wall. Blonde ponytail pulled tight, perfectly sculpted arms, a six-pack visible even beneath her bright purple "Feel the Fierce" tank top. She looked the part. But did she feel it? That was the question that kept whispering through the upbeat music and the rhythmic grunts.

## Setting:

**The "Ignite Your Inner Fire" Fitness Studio, located in the burgeoning arts district of Willow Creek, Oregon.** The studio occupies the ground floor of a renovated brick building, its large windows letting in (mostly) natural light and a constant stream of pedestrian traffic. Inside, the walls are painted a vibrant, almost aggressively cheerful shade of orange, adorned with motivational posters featuring airbrushed bodies and slogans like "No Pain, No Gain!" and "Sweat is Your Fat Crying!"

The main studio space is a large, open room dominated by a wall of mirrors and packed with rows of yoga mats, free weights, resistance bands, and various torture devices disguised as exercise equipment. A small reception area with a brightly colored desk and a bulletin board overflowing with flyers for smoothie bars and chakra alignment workshops sits just inside the entrance. The air is perpetually thick with the combined aromas of disinfectant, protein powder, and the aforementioned bananas, creating a unique and slightly unsettling olfactory experience.
