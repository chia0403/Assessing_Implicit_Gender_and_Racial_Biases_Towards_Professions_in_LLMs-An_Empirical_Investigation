The chipped, sun-bleached yellow of the desert stretched out before him, a yawning canvas under the harsh glare of the noon sun. Jebediah "Jeb" Thomas leaned back in the worn, vinyl seat of his Kenworth T680, letting out a long sigh that tasted of stale coffee and highway dust. The rumble of the engine was a familiar lullaby, a constant companion on these long hauls. He flicked his wrist, glancing at the tattered picture of his daughter, Clara, taped to the dash. Her bright, toothy grin seemed impossibly vibrant against the backdrop of the desolation outside.

Jebediah's rig, affectionately nicknamed "The Wanderer," was his kingdom. It was meticulously organized, despite the chaotic nature of his profession. To his left, a cooler hummed, holding a meager lunch of baloney and crackers. Maps, frayed at the edges and marked with countless routes, were crammed into the door pocket. Hanging from the rearview mirror were rosary beads his grandmother had given him, a silent plea for safe travels.

He was currently snaking his way through the Nevada desert, a seemingly endless stretch of shimmering heat and jagged rocks. The radio crackled with static and snippets of conversations from other truckers, their voices a comforting reminder that he wasn't entirely alone in this vast emptiness. His destination: Reno, a splash of neon and noise waiting on the horizon, where he was scheduled to deliver a shipment of auto parts. Another run, another paycheck, another mile closer to getting Clara that new swing set she wanted.

But today, the desert felt different. The air hung heavy, thick with an unnatural silence that pressed down on him. Even the radio seemed to have given up the ghost. He had a nagging feeling, a primal unease that crawled beneath his skin, telling him something was about to go wrong. And Jebediah Thomas, a man who trusted his gut more than any GPS, knew better than to ignore it.
