The midday sun, usually a welcome sight in perpetually grey Seattle, beat down with a relentless intensity on the brick facade of Rainier Valley High. Eleanor Victoria Ainsworth, a woman whose perpetually tired eyes seemed to reflect the very soul of the institution, sighed and squinted as she wrestled her tote bag higher onto her shoulder. Inside rattled a ceramic mug – half-full of tepid, forgettably bad office coffee – and a stack of referral forms thick enough to suggest the student body was teetering on the brink of collective meltdown. Eleanor, the school psychologist, wouldn't have been entirely surprised. After all, it *was* Tuesday.

Rainier Valley High was a pressure cooker of expectations, anxieties, and hormones, housed within a building that looked like a repurposed factory. Chain-link fences ringed the perimeter, doing little to deter graffiti artists who treated the bare brick walls like their personal canvases. Inside, the hallways buzzed with a nervous energy, a palpable tension that Eleanor could practically taste. Lockers slammed like miniature explosions, punctuating the drone of teenage voices and the rhythmic squeak of sneakers on linoleum. The air was thick with the scent of floor wax, stale pizza, and something vaguely floral that Eleanor suspected was overly-perfumed body spray.

It wasn't a terrible place, not inherently. Beneath the surface chaos, there were glimmers of hope, moments of genuine connection, sparks of brilliance. But finding those sparks, nurturing them, required sifting through layers of apathy, defiance, and genuine pain. And Eleanor Victoria Ainsworth, armed with her bad coffee and her even worse coping mechanisms, was tasked with just that, one struggling teenager at a time. Today, the first name on her overflowing list was Sarah, a sophomore with a disruptive streak as wide as the Grand Canyon and a history of… well, Eleanor would find out. She just hoped the coffee would hold out long enough.
