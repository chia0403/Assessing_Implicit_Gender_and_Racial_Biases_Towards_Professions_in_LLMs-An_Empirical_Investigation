Okay, here's a story opening and setting:

**Setting:** The sprawling, sun-drenched backlot of Silver Screen Studios in Burbank, California. It's a late afternoon in mid-July, the air thick with the scent of freshly cut grass from the meticulously manicured lawns surrounding the various soundstages. The iconic water tower looms in the distance, casting a long, slanted shadow. There's a constant hum of activity – the muffled sounds of hammers from set construction, snippets of conversations carried on the breeze, and the distant bleating of an emergency vehicle siren.

**Story Opening:**

Ava Beatrice Sterling, her trademark oversized sunglasses perched on her nose, chewed aggressively on a stick of sugar-free gum. The script for "The Serpent's Kiss," her latest foray into the world of neo-noir thriller, lay open on the hood of her vintage Mustang, the pages flapping gently in the slight breeze.  Ava swore she could feel the weight of its potential – either a box office smash that would solidify her place as Hollywood's leading female director, or a critical flop that would send her back to directing low-budget horror flicks for streaming services. The sweat beaded on her forehead had less to do with the California heat and more to do with the looming pressure.  Across from her, a harried assistant director, a young man named Kevin, was practically vibrating with nervous energy as he tried to keep the chaos of the pre-production crew at bay.  "Ava, we've got a problem with the… the snakes," Kevin stammered, his eyes wide. Ava sighed, pushing her sunglasses higher on her nose. Snakes. Of course there were problems with the snakes. This was just her luck.
