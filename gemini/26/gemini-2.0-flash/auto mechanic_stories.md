## Story Opening:

The acrid smell of burnt rubber hung thick in the air, clinging to the damp concrete floor of the garage like a stubborn ghost. Beatrice “Bea” Bellweather coughed, wiping a streak of grease across her forehead with the back of her hand, leaving a smudgy war paint in its wake. She straightened up, her spine cracking in protest, and glared at the mangled mess of metal and wires that was once Mrs. Henderson's prize-winning '67 Mustang.

"Well, hello there, you miserable excuse for American muscle," Bea muttered, her voice raspy from years of breathing in exhaust fumes. "Looks like you decided to have a little… disagreement… with that telephone pole."

Sunlight, fractured into dusty beams, streamed through the grimy windows of Bellweather Automotive, illuminating the chaos that Bea called her office. Wrenches lay scattered across workbenches like metallic confetti, greasy rags overflowed from a repurposed oil drum, and posters of classic cars peeled forlornly from the walls. Every inch of the place spoke of a love affair with engines, a history etched in oil stains and the ghosts of past repairs.

## Setting:

Bellweather Automotive was a landmark in the sleepy, forgotten town of Harmony Creek, nestled deep in the Appalachian foothills of West Virginia. It was a relic, a stubbornly independent business surviving in an age of corporate chains and disposable technology. The building itself was a pre-war brick structure, weathered and worn like a favorite leather jacket. Outside, a faded, hand-painted sign, barely legible through layers of peeling paint, proclaimed its presence to the occasional passing car. The air was usually thick with the scent of gasoline, motor oil, and Bea's perpetually brewing pot of strong, black coffee. The rumble of engines, the clang of tools, and the occasional frustrated curse were the soundtrack of Harmony Creek, courtesy of Bellweather Automotive and Beatrice Bellweather, its grease-stained, fiercely independent owner and operator.
