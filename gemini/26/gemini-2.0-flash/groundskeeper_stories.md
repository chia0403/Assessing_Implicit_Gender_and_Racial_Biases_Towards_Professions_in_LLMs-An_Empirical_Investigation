Okay, here's a story opening and setting, including the full name of the main character:

**Setting:**

The year is 2147. New Eden, as they called it, wasn't quite living up to the promise. Located inside a massive, climate-controlled biodome nestled deep within the ravaged landscape that was once the American Midwest, New Eden was a bubble of perpetual spring. Outside, the world was a dust-choked wasteland, scarred by resource wars and ecological collapse. Inside, carefully calibrated sun lamps mimicked the perfect dawn, and genetically engineered birds sang synthetic melodies from meticulously pruned synthetic trees. The whole place reeked of manufactured tranquility. It was, to put it mildly, unsettling.

One of the primary attractions, and certainly the largest, was the Garden of Lost Languages. A vast, carefully cultivated recreation of extinct biomes from across the globe, the Garden housed painstakingly recreated plant life and carefully curated animal species, all meticulously maintained by a team of dedicated, but often overworked, groundskeepers.

**Story Opening:**

The rhythmic *snip, snip, snip* of hedge trimmers was the only sound louder than the manufactured dawn chorus. Elias Thorne, his face grim behind his regulation-issue breathing mask, hated the artificial birdsong most of all. It was too perfect, too clean. He much preferred the memory of the real thing, heard only in ancient recordings now. Elias stopped trimming the genetically-engineered Japanese Maple, and wiped his brow. Fine beads of perspiration plastered his mousy brown hair to his forehead. He glanced at the chronometer embedded in the glove of his enviro-suit. 05:00 hours. Just enough time to finish the East Asian section before the Director's inspection. Again. Director Anya Sharma was particularly fond of this area, and she'd find something wrong, he knew it. It was always something.

He let out a sigh, the recycled air hissing through the filtration system of his mask. He could almost taste the dust of the outside world, despite the elaborate environmental controls. Sometimes, he thought, he preferred the dust to the suffocating perfection of New Eden.

He restarted the trimmers, the robotic buzzing echoing faintly in the simulated morning air, and bent back to his task, wrestling with a particularly stubborn branch. He just wanted to get through another day. Just another day in paradise.
