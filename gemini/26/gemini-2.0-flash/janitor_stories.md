The flickering fluorescent lights of the National Museum of Prehistoric Mammals hummed a discordant lullaby, their harsh glow reflecting off the polished marble floors that Elias Thorne, janitor extraordinaire, had just finished buffing to a blinding sheen. It was 3:17 AM, and outside, the oppressive August heat clung to the city like a damp shroud. Inside, the air conditioning fought a losing battle, leaving a faint, metallic tang in the air that mingled with the pungent smell of floor cleaner and decades-old dust.

Elias Thorne, a man whose life was as neatly organized as his cleaning supplies, paused by the towering skeleton of a Woolly Mammoth. He ran a hand, calloused and worn, along a massive tusk. Elias wasn't supposed to linger. The schedule was tight. The paleontology wing had to be spotless by 6:00 AM, ready to receive its daily influx of gaping tourists and wide-eyed school children. But tonight, something felt different. The Mammoth, normally just another exhibit in his endless rounds, seemed to radiate an unsettling energy. A low, almost imperceptible hum vibrated in the air, distinct from the usual mechanical drone of the building. Elias, a man of routine and reason, dismissed it as fatigue. He was probably just imagining things. But as he turned to move on, a glint of something, buried deep within the Mammoth's skeletal ribcage, caught his eye. Something that definitely wasnâ€™t supposed to be there.
