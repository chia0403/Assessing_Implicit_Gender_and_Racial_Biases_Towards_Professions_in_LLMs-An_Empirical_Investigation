Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a housekeeper named Eleanor Ainsworth:

**Setting:** The sprawling, slightly crumbling estate of Blackwood Manor, nestled deep within the perpetually misty Dartmoor. It's late October. The trees lining the long, winding driveway are skeletal, their last leaves clinging on precariously like desperate fingers. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and woodsmoke, a constant reminder of the peat fires that burn day and night in Blackwood's vast hearths. The interior of the manor is a paradox: Grand rooms filled with priceless antiques are juxtaposed with peeling wallpaper, drafty windows, and the persistent whisper of decay.

**Opening:**

Eleanor Ainsworth sighed, the sound swallowed by the cavernous entrance hall of Blackwood Manor. Dust motes danced in the weak sunlight filtering through the grimy, leaded glass windows. She hated October at Blackwood. The dampness seemed to seep into her bones, amplifying the loneliness that already clung to her like the moorland mist. Ten years she'd been cleaning this place, ten years of polishing silver that hadn't been used in decades, of dusting portraits of generations of Blackwoodâ€™s who stared down at her with cold, aristocratic disapproval. Ten years of the same routine, the same silence, the same feeling of being a ghost in someone else's grand, dying story. Today, though, felt different. More...charged. A tremor of unease tickled her spine as she adjusted the strap of her cleaning apron. The master, Mr. Alistair Blackwood, was due back from London today. He hadn't been at Blackwood in nearly five years. Eleanor had always received her instructions from his solicitor, a brusque, unpleasant man named Mr. Harding. Now, after all this time, Alistair Blackwood was finally coming home. And Eleanor Ainsworth couldn't shake the feeling that something was about to change, something significant, and perhaps, something dreadful.
