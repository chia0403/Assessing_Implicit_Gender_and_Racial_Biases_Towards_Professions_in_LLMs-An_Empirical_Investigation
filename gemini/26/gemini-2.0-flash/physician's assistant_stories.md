The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face as he wrestled with the stubbornly knotted mooring line. The "Sea Serpent," his grandfather’s battered fishing trawler, bucked against the pilings, eager to be free of the slip. Dawn was a bruised purple and orange smear on the horizon, painting the ramshackle docks of Port Blossom, Maine, in a fleeting, ethereal beauty. The air, thick with the briny scent of decaying seaweed and diesel fuel, was a stark contrast to the sanitized, lavender-scented air of the clinic where Elias usually spent his days. He preferred it.

Port Blossom was a town clinging stubbornly to the edge of the Atlantic, its economy once buoyed by fishing and now struggling to survive on the crumbs of summer tourism. The tourists, bless their sunburnt hearts, didn't come out this early. They wouldn't see the real Port Blossom, the one where grizzled fishermen like Elias’s grandfather still hauled lobster pots, and widows tended their meager gardens, hoping for a glimpse of their lost husbands in the restless waves. Elias Thorne, Physician’s Assistant, felt more at home in this forgotten corner of the world than he ever had in the sterile suburbs where he’d grown up. He’d come back after PA school, much to the chagrin of his parents, promising himself he’d help this town, one cough, cut, or chronic ailment at a time.
