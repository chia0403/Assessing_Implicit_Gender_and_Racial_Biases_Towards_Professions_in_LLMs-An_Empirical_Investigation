Okay, here's a story opening and setting, including the full name of the main character, who is a manicurist:

**Story Opening:**

The cloying scent of almond cuticle oil and stale regret hung thick in the air, a familiar perfume in the cramped confines of "Nails by Nina."  Delilah "Dee" Rosewater stared at her reflection in the dusty mirror, her face a mask of carefully applied calm that barely concealed the buzzing energy beneath. She ran a trembling hand over the perfectly sculpted acrylics she'd painstakingly applied that morning â€“ a vibrant, almost obscene, shade of electric blue. Today was going to be *huge*. Today, Delilah Rosewater was finally going to break free of this fluorescent-lit purgatory and launch her own line of cruelty-free, crystal-infused polishes to the world. All she needed was the seed money, and Mrs. Higgins, with her notoriously thick wallet and even thicker ankles, was due in at 2:00 for a gel refill. This was it. This was her shot. Unless, of course, the floor decided to swallow her whole first.

**Setting:**

"Nails by Nina" was a sliver of a storefront tucked between a perpetually-closing laundromat and a discount tax preparation service in a struggling strip mall on the outskirts of Harmony, Ohio.  The interior was a chaotic tapestry of clashing textures and colors.  Four mismatched manicure stations, each adorned with a dizzying array of nail polishes (ranging from chipped and faded to suspiciously fluorescent), were arranged haphazardly in the small space. The walls were painted a sickly Pepto-Bismol pink and adorned with faded posters of impossibly perfect hands sporting impossible nail art.  A flickering fluorescent light buzzed incessantly overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on everything.  A small, cluttered reception desk, buried under a mountain of appointment books and half-eaten bags of chips, guarded the entrance.  The overall impression was one of cheerful desperation, a place where dreams were filed and buffed, but rarely took flight.
