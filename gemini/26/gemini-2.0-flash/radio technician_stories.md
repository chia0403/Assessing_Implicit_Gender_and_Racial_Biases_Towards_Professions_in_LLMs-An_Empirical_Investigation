## Story Opening:

The hum was driving Beatrice "Bea" Montgomery mad. Not the comforting, low thrum of the vacuum tubes in her transmitter, no. This was a high-pitched whine, a mosquito in the ear of the airwaves, and it was coming from somewhere within the belly of WOJB, Johnsonburg's sole radio station.

Bea gripped the oily rag in her hand, wiping a smudge of grime from her already blackened cheek. She’d been troubleshooting the infernal thing for three hours, ever since Old Man Hemlock, the station manager, had practically wrestled her out of her Sunday dinner with a panicked phone call. “Bea, honey, the airwaves are bleedin’!” he’d croaked, dramatic as ever. "Get down here before we lose our damn sponsorships!"

Bea sighed. Sponsorships were Hemlock's lifeblood, and WOJB was Beatrice Montgomery's. It was a symbiotic, if slightly dysfunctional, relationship.

## Setting:

Johnsonburg, nestled deep within the Allegheny Mountains of Pennsylvania, was a town steeped in the ghosts of coal and lumber. The year was 1948. The post-war optimism felt thin here, clinging to the clapboard houses and crumbling brick storefronts like peeling paint. The Main Street movie theatre, the Lyric, still showed newsreels before the features, chronicling progress and prosperity, but in Johnsonburg, progress moved slower, and prosperity felt a long way off.

WOJB, located on the second floor of a dusty building above O'Malley's Hardware, was a cramped, chaotic space. Wires snaked across the linoleum floor like metallic vines, climbing over stacks of old records and discarded newspapers. The air was thick with the smell of dust, ozone, and the faint, lingering scent of Old Man Hemlock's pipe tobacco. The studio itself was surprisingly small, dominated by a single microphone and a worn-out velvet armchair that had seen better days. Beyond the studio, in the "technical room," as Bea stubbornly insisted on calling it despite Hemlock's insistence on "the engineering bay," resided the heart of WOJB: a hulking, Frankensteinian collection of vacuum tubes, resistors, capacitors, and meters. It was in this room, amidst the comforting chaos of her tools and the warm glow of the tubes, that Beatrice Montgomery felt most at home. It was also here, surrounded by the offending equipment, that the hum grew louder, closer, a maddening symphony of malfunction.
