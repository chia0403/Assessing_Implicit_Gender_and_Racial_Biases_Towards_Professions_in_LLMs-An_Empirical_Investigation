The humid New Orleans air clung to Amelia Claire Dubois like a second skin, slicking her hair to her temples and beading on her upper lip. The smell of jasmine and something distinctly less pleasant - brackish water and rotting fish - permeated the French Quarter, a heady cocktail that always simultaneously fascinated and repelled her.

It was just past seven in the morning, and the normally boisterous streets were still mostly silent, save for the rhythmic swishing of street sweepers clearing away the remnants of the previous night's revelry. Amelia stood on the wrought-iron balcony of her apartment building, a repurposed townhouse overlooking Royal Street. The building, painted a faded shade of cerulean blue, was a far cry from the antiseptic confines of her Chicago newsroom, but it held a charm that had quickly burrowed its way into her heart.

Below, a lone pigeon pecked at a discarded beignet, its feathers ruffled in the gentle breeze. Amelia took a long drag of her chicory coffee, the bitter brew doing little to dispel the knot of unease tightening in her stomach. Today was the day. Today, she would finally interview Madame Evangeline, the reclusive voodoo priestess rumored to hold the key to a decades-old unsolved murder â€“ a story Amelia had been chasing since the moment she arrived in New Orleans six months ago, desperate to prove she was more than just another pretty face with a byline. The weight of her ambition, the pressure to succeed, felt as heavy as the humid air itself.
