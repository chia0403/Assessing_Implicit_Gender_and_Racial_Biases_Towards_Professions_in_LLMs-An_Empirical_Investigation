## The Setting:

The biting wind whipped off the Firth of Forth, carrying with it the tang of salt and the mournful cry of gulls. The year was 1888, and Edinburgh was shrouded in a perpetual gloom, a pall that clung to the cobbled streets and the soot-stained tenements like a tenacious lover. Rain, a near constant companion, slicked the stone facades, making them gleam under the flickering gas lamps. In the heart of the Old Town, within the cramped confines of a two-room flat above a bustling butcher's shop, a different kind of darkness brewed.

The flat itself was spartan but functional. The air, thick with the smell of carbolic soap and dried herbs, spoke of the doctor who resided within. Shelves lined the walls, crammed with medical texts, apothecary jars, and anatomical charts. A worn Persian rug, its vibrant colors faded with age, attempted to soften the harshness of the stone floor. Outside the grimy window, the sound of clattering carts and hawkers' cries battled for dominance, a cacophony that had become a familiar, albeit unwelcome, lullaby.

## The Opening:

The incessant knocking echoed through the flat, sharp and insistent. Dr. Alistair MacLeod, his face etched with fatigue, groaned and pulled himself away from the dissecting table. The stench of formaldehyde hung heavy in the air, mingling unpleasantly with the butcher's offal fumes seeping up from below. He wiped his blood-stained hands on his apron, a grimace twisting his lips. It was past midnight, and whatever emergency had dragged this unfortunate soul from their bed was unlikely to be trivial.

"Blast," he muttered, running a hand through his unruly dark hair, strands of which were already dusted with the grim chalkiness of anatomical dust. "Just when I was on the verge of understanding the intricacies of the tricuspid valve." He shuffled towards the door, the worn floorboards creaking a mournful protest under his weight. He knew, with a sinking feeling in his gut, that whatever awaited him on the other side of that door was likely to be another tragedy in a city overflowing with them.
