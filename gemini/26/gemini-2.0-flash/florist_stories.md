The clanging of the delivery vanâ€™s door jolted Clementine Beatrice Willowbrook out of her reverie. She was lost in the scent of tuberose, a single stem she'd been meticulously wiring for a bridal bouquet, its intoxicating perfume filling the small potting room like a heady summer dream. Outside, rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the workshop, a frantic drumming that threatened to drown out the gentle hum of classical music she always played to "soothe the stems," as she jokingly told her few customers.

Clementine's Haven was nestled in the heart of Oakhaven, a quaint, if slightly dilapidated, village clinging to the edge of the Yorkshire Dales. Oakhaven was a place of stoic stone cottages, perpetually damp cobblestone streets, and a pervading sense of quiet melancholy. It was a village where secrets grew as freely as the rambling roses that climbed the ancient walls. And Clementine, with her vibrant spirit and a kaleidoscope of flowers spilling out of her tiny shop window, was something of an anomaly in the muted landscape. Her shop, a converted stables attached to her equally humble cottage, was a riot of colour against the grey backdrop, a beacon promising beauty and solace in a place where both felt increasingly scarce.
