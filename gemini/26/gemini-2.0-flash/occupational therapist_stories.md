Okay, here's a story opening and setting, including the full name of the main character:

**Story Opening:**

The scent of antiseptic and overripe lilies hung heavy in the air, a morbid perfume that clung to Eleanor Maeve Archer like a second skin. Eleanor straightened, pressing the small of her back against the cool metal of the nurses' station. The fluorescent lights of the Willow Creek Rehabilitation Center buzzed with the same restless energy she felt thrumming beneath her skin. She glanced at the clock: 5:57 PM. Almost time. Another three minutes and she could escape the echoing hallways and the well-meaning, but often heartbreaking, stories of recovery and loss. Tonight, she needed silence. Tonight, she needed the crashing waves and the cry of gulls, anything to drown out the phantom beeps of heart monitors and the shuffle of walkers. But first, Mrs. Petrovic. Eleanor took a deep breath and plastered on her most encouraging smile.

**Setting:**

The primary setting is the **Willow Creek Rehabilitation Center**, a mid-sized facility located in the fictional coastal town of Oakhaven, California.

*   **Exterior:** The building is a modern, single-story structure with large windows offering views of the Pacific Ocean, though most patients are too focused on their recovery to truly appreciate the scenery. The landscaping is well-maintained but somewhat sterile, featuring generic shrubs and a few struggling palm trees.

*   **Interior:** The interior is bright and clean, but undeniably institutional. The walls are painted in calming shades of blue and green, and the floors are covered in durable, easy-to-clean linoleum. The center includes a large gymnasium equipped with various therapy machines, a hydrotherapy pool, several individual treatment rooms, a dining hall, and a common area with a television and board games. The overall atmosphere is one of determined optimism, masking the underlying realities of pain, frustration, and sometimes, permanent disability.

**Full Name of Main Character:**

**Eleanor Maeve Archer** is an occupational therapist working at Willow Creek Rehabilitation Center.
