Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Elias Thorneâ€™s thirty-second-floor office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside him.  The Chicago skyline, usually a glittering tapestry of steel and glass, was obscured by a curtain of grey.  Beneath the muted roar of the city, Elias could hear the insistent thrum of the Bloomberg terminal, spitting out real-time updates that currently painted a grim picture.  His tailored suit felt constricting, the silk tie a noose around his neck.  At 37, Elias Thorne, a name synonymous with calculated risk and audacious plays in the cutthroat world of high-frequency trading, was staring down the barrel of his biggest loss yet. Not a monetary loss, though the sum was substantial enough to make even a seasoned broker flinch. This was a loss of faith, a loss of control, a loss that threatened to unravel the meticulously crafted persona he'd spent years building on the trading floor of Sterling-Holt Investments.
