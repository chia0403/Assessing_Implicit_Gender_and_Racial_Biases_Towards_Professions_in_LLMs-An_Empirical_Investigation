The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of The Rusty Mug, a rhythm that usually lulled Adeline “Addie” Bellweather into a sort of meditative trance while she polished glasses. Tonight, however, the relentless drumming mirrored the anxiety churning in her stomach.  The Mug, nestled between a pawn shop and a perpetually closed fortune teller's parlor in the forgotten corner of Port Blossom, Oregon, was usually a haven of quiet murmurs and the clinking of ice.  But tonight, the air hung thick with an unnatural stillness, broken only by the occasional gust of wind rattling the chipped paint on the windowpanes. Addie glanced at the ancient clock above the dusty liquor bottles. 11:58 PM. Two minutes until closing time, and not a soul in sight.  Which was odd.  Even on a Tuesday, there were usually a few stragglers nursing their last beers.  Tonight, however, the only company Addie had was the flickering neon sign outside, casting a sickly green glow across the empty barstools.
