The frosted glass of Amelia Finch's office door declared, in elegant gold lettering, "Finch & Sons Bookkeeping."  The "Sons" were long gone, scattered to the winds of ambition and bad investments, leaving Amelia, at the ripe old age of sixty-two, as the sole guardian of their legacy.  Her office, nestled above a bustling bakery on the cobbled streets of Port Blossom, Maine, smelled perpetually of yeast and sugar, a sweet counterpoint to the dry rustle of ledger pages and the metallic tang of ink.  The November wind howled outside, rattling the windowpanes and sending flurries of snow swirling against the brick facade. Inside, a single lamp illuminated Amelia's desk, where a meticulously organized stack of invoices awaited her attention.  A steaming mug of Earl Grey tea sat beside them, the only other splash of warmth in the otherwise austere room.  This was Amelia's kingdom, a realm of precise figures and unwavering balance, a world she understood far better than the chaotic one that existed beyond her frosted glass door. But the arrival of a thick, unmarked envelope, slipped under the door just moments before, promised to disrupt that delicate equilibrium.
