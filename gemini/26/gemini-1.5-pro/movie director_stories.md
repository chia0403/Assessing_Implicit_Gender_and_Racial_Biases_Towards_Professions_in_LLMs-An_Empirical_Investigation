The biting November wind whipped around Vivian Holloway-Wells as she stood on the precipice of the abandoned quarry, the slate-grey sky mirroring the sheer drop below.  Dust devils danced across the barren floor, kicking up ochre-colored dirt that tasted like rust on her tongue.  This desolate landscape, scarred by years of industrial excavation, was a far cry from the sun-drenched beaches of Malibu where Vivian had shot her last blockbuster, "Sunset Rendezvous."  But this wasn't a location scout for a glamorous rom-com.  This was personal. This was where Vivian Holloway-Wells, the two-time Oscar-winning director known for her breathtaking visuals and emotionally resonant storytelling, was going to film her comeback.  A comeback that would either cement her legacy or shatter it entirely.  This desolate quarry, nestled deep in the heart of the Welsh countryside, held the key to a story that had haunted her for decades.
