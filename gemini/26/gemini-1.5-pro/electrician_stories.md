The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorne, making the thin fabric of his work jacket feel utterly useless.  He hunched deeper into himself, squinting at the dilapidated Victorian mansion looming before him like a gothic tombstone against the bruised twilight sky.  Wisteria, long dead and brittle, clawed at the peeling paint of the porch, and a single, flickering gas lamp cast elongated, skeletal shadows across the overgrown lawn.  Elias, his toolbox heavy in his calloused hand, trudged up the cracked concrete path to Blackwood Manor, his breath puffing out in white clouds. He'd received a frantic call from Mrs. Albright, the elderly caretaker, about a complete power outage, and while he usually avoided this place – local legend painted it as a hotbed of strange happenings – a paying job was a paying job, especially with winter closing in.
