The biting November wind whipped around Vivienne Holloway, snagging at the edges of her crimson beret and sending a shiver down her spine despite the thick wool of her coat.  The flickering gaslights of Gaslight Alley cast elongated, dancing shadows that seemed to mock her hurried pace.  Above, a bruised purple sky threatened snow.
