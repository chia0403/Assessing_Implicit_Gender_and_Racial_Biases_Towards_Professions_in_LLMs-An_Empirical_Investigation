Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Anya Sharma's Ford Focus, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her. The sickly sweet scent of stale coffee and despair clung to the fabric seats, a familiar aroma in her line of work.  Anya, full name Anya Sharmila Sharma, tapped her pen against the steering wheel, the rhythmic clicking a counterpoint to the relentless drumming of the rain.  She was parked across the street from a dilapidated two-story house in the Hollow Creek district of Ashworth, a town that wore its economic hardships like a threadbare coat.  Paint peeled from the clapboard siding of the house, revealing the grey, weathered wood beneath.  A single bare bulb flickered in a downstairs window, casting a sickly yellow glow that did little to dispel the encroaching gloom.  This was the residence of Marcus “Razor” Riley, Anya’s newest client, and she had a distinct feeling this visit wasn’t going to be a friendly catch-up.
