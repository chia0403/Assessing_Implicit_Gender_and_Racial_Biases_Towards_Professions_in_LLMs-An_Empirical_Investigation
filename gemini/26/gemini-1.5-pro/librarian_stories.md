The frosted breath of Elias Thorne, Head Librarian of the Whispering Pines Public Library, puffed out in small, white clouds as he unlocked the heavy oak doors.  The November air, sharp and clean, nipped at his exposed ears, a stark contrast to the musty, comforting scent of old paper and leather that awaited him inside.  Whispering Pines, a small town nestled in the foothills of the Adirondack Mountains, was still draped in the pre-dawn gloom.  Snow dusted the peaked roofs of the Victorian-era buildings that lined Main Street, and the only sound was the soft crunch of Elias's boots on the freshly fallen powder. The library, a grand, two-story stone edifice with tall, arched windows, stood as a silent sentinel against the encroaching darkness. Its warm, inviting glow promised solace and stories within, a beacon against the chill both outside and in.
