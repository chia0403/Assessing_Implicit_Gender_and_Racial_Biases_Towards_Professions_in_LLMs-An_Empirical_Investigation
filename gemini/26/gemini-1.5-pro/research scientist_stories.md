The biting wind whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne's ankles as he adjusted the high-powered telescope, its brass gleaming faintly in the perpetual twilight of the Antarctic plateau.  Dome C, nestled two miles above sea level and thousands of miles from civilization, was a brutal mistress, offering breathtakingly clear skies in exchange for relentless cold and an oppressive isolation.  Elias, bundled in layers that made him resemble a less cuddly Michelin Man, exhaled a puff of frost that instantly crystallized in the air.  Tonight, however, discomfort was a small price to pay.  Tonight, Elias hoped to glimpse something that would rewrite the textbooks, something that would change humanity's understanding of the universe: evidence of life beyond Earth. The radio telescope, a massive dish aimed at a specific point in the vast emptiness, hummed softly beside him, a constant background thrum against the keening wind.  This wasn't a search for little green men; Elias was looking for something far more subtle, a faint biosignature in the atmosphere of a newly discovered exoplanet orbiting a distant star.
