The biting November wind whipped at Amelia “Milly” Hawthorne’s cheeks, turning them the same shade as the crimson maple leaves she was raking into a neat pile. Frost crunched under her boots as she surveyed her handiwork in the sprawling gardens of Blackwood Manor.  Blackwood, a gothic monstrosity of grey stone and leaded glass, perched precariously on a cliff overlooking the churning slate-grey waters of the North Sea. The gardens, Milly's domain for the past five years, were a riot of late autumn colour, a defiant blaze of glory against the encroaching gloom of winter.  She inhaled deeply, the sharp tang of salt and decaying vegetation filling her lungs.  It was a desolate, beautiful place, and Milly, despite the chill, felt a familiar tug of belonging amidst the gnarled branches and windswept flowerbeds. But today, something felt different. A disquiet hung in the air, heavier than the sea mist that clung to the cliff face, a premonition that the serenity of Blackwood Manor was about to be shattered.
