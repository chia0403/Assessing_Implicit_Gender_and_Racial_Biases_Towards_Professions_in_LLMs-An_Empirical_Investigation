The wind, a relentless sculptor, had carved deep lines into Elias Thatcher's face, mirroring the furrows etched into the parched earth of his ranch.  The Double Bar T, nestled in the shadow of the  Bloodstone Mountains of southeastern Arizona, was a kingdom of dust and resilience.  It hadn't rained properly in eight months, and the usually vibrant ochre landscape had faded to a pale, bone-white.  The skeletal remains of cholla cacti clawed at the sky, their spines glinting like warnings in the relentless sun.  Elias, perched on the splintered top rail of the corral, watched his remaining herd of Hereford cattle jostle for position at the near-empty water trough.  The metallic clang of their tags punctuated the dry, whispering wind, a sound that usually brought him comfort, but today echoed the hollow ache in his gut.  This drought, unlike any he'd seen in his sixty-odd years, threatened to steal not only his livelihood but also the legacy carved into this hard land by generations of Thatchers before him.
