Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Elias Thorneâ€™s office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside him. Twenty-seven stories above the relentless pulse of downtown Chicago, the city lights blurred into an impressionistic smear of gold and crimson. Elias, his dark hair disheveled, rubbed the bridge of his nose, leaving a smudge of graphite on his already pale skin.  His meticulously designed workspace, usually a sanctuary of clean lines and minimalist elegance, was currently strewn with blueprints, crumpled sketches, and half-empty coffee cups.  The centerpiece, a scale model of the "Zephyr Tower," his most ambitious project to date, sat like a fragile accusation amidst the chaos.  The sleek, spiraling structure, destined to be the city's tallest residential building, was supposed to be his masterpiece. Instead, it was quickly becoming a monument to his mounting anxieties. A single, glaring red mark from the city planning committee's review screamed from one of the blueprints, a fatal flaw threatening to unravel the entire project and potentially, Elias's career.
