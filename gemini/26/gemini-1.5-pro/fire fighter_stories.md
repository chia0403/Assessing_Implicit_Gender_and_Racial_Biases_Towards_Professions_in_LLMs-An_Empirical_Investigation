The biting wind whipped at Amelia "Amy" Reyes's turnout coat, stinging her exposed cheeks as she stood on the precipice of Echo Canyon. Below, a ribbon of crimson snaked through the chaparral, flames licking at the dry brush with a hungry roar. The scent of burning pine and sage hung heavy in the air, thick enough to taste.  Amy, a five-year veteran of the Prescott Fire Department, tightened her grip on her helmet. The Santa Ana winds, notorious for fanning wildfires into infernos, were howling down from the mountains, turning a routine brush fire into a potential catastrophe.  The setting sun cast long, distorted shadows across the rugged landscape, painting the rising smoke plumes in apocalyptic hues of orange and black. Echo Canyon, normally a haven for hikers and rock climbers, was now a scene of chaos, the tranquil evening air replaced by the crackling symphony of destruction.
