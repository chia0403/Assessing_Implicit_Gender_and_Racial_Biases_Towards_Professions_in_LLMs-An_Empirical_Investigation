The biting wind whipped Amelia “Amy” Rodriguez’s hair across her face as she knelt beside the crumpled hood of a Ford Explorer.  Sleek black ice, invisible against the pre-dawn darkness, had claimed another victim on the treacherous stretch of Highway 16 outside of Cedar Ridge, Colorado.  Flakes of snow, fat and lazy, began to drift down, obscuring the already limited visibility. The swirling red and blue lights of the ambulance reflected in the icy puddles gathering around the wreckage, painting the scene in an unsettling festive glow.  Amy, her breath clouding in the frigid air, tightened her grip on the trauma shears, the metallic tang of blood sharp against the crisp scent of pine from the surrounding forest.  A groan from within the SUV galvanized her, and she muttered a quick prayer under her breath. This was going to be a long night.
