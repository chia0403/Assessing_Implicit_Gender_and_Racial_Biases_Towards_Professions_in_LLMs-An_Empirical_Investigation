The bell above the door of "Petal & Stem" jingled merrily, a counterpoint to the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of Eliza Jane Worthington’s shears.  Outside, the Charleston, South Carolina air hung thick and humid, promising a summer thunderstorm later in the day. Inside, the small shop was a cool oasis, fragrant with the perfume of lilies, roses, and the earthy scent of damp soil.  Eliza Jane, her auburn braid draped over her shoulder like a thick rope, hummed along to the jazz drifting from the antique radio perched on a shelf amongst terracotta pots. Sunlight, filtered through the leafy awning outside, dappled the polished wooden floor, illuminating vibrant bouquets arranged with artful precision.  This was Eliza Jane’s sanctuary, a world built from thorns and blossoms, and she ruled it with gentle, green-thumbed authority.  Today, however, the usual tranquility was about to be uprooted.
