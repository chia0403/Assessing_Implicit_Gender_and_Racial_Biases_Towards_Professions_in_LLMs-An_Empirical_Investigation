The biting November wind whipped around Agnes Periwinkle, stinging her cheeks as she wrestled Mrs. Hemlock's wrought-iron gate open.  Rust flaked off like dried blood onto her chapped hands. Number 47, Hemlock House, loomed before her, a gothic monstrosity of grey stone perched on a hill overlooking the perpetually mist-shrouded town of Hollow Creek. Gargoyles, their features softened by centuries of rain, leered down from the eaves, and ivy, thick as a man's arm, clawed at the walls. Agnes tucked a stray strand of grey hair behind her ear, adjusted the worn satchel containing her cleaning supplies, and trudged up the winding path, the gravel crunching beneath her sturdy boots.  Hemlock House held its breath, silent and watchful, waiting for Agnes to break the stillness within.
