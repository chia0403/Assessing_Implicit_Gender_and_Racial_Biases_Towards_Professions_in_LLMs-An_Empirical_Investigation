The biting wind whipped across the salt-laced dunes, stinging Elara Thistlewick's cheeks and turning her breath into fleeting white clouds.  The sky, a bruised purple canvas streaked with angry orange, promised a storm.  Elara tugged her thick wool cap lower, its knitted puffin flapping precariously in the gale, and surveyed the rocky outcrop of Gannet Island.  Home to thousands of seabirds, the island, a jagged tooth jutting from the tempestuous North Atlantic, was Elara's domain. For the past five years, she had been its sole human inhabitant, serving as caretaker, researcher, and confidante to its feathered residents.  The lighthouse, a squat, white sentinel perched on the island's highest point, was both her refuge and her laboratory, filled with the comforting smells of salt, guano, and brewing tea. Tonight, however, a different scent hung heavy in the air â€“ a metallic tang, sharp and unfamiliar, that spoke of something washed ashore. Something more than seaweed and driftwood.
