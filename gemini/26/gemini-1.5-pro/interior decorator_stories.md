Rain lashed against the arched windows of Genevieve Beaumont's atelier, mimicking the chaotic rhythm of her thoughts.  Her studio, nestled above a bustling antique shop on cobbled Rue Cler in Paris, usually felt like a sanctuary, a haven of silks and velvets, of paint swatches and aged wood samples. Today, however, it felt like a gilded cage. Genevieve, her auburn hair pulled back in a loose knot, paced the worn Persian rug, the scent of lavender and beeswax candles doing little to soothe her mounting anxiety.  The call from Monsieur Dubois, her most prestigious client, had thrown her meticulously planned week, and possibly her entire career, into disarray. He'd demanded, not requested, a complete redesign of his chateau's grand salon by the end of the month â€“ a feat bordering on the impossible, even for someone with Genevieve's reputation for transforming spaces with a flick of her wrist and a whisper of inspiration.  Outside, the Parisian sky wept, reflecting the turmoil churning within Genevieve's usually calm and collected demeanor.
