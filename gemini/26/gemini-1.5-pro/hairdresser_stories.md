The snip of Amelia "Amy" Dubois's scissors punctuated the humid Charleston air, rhythmic and precise. Spanish moss, heavy with the morning dew, dripped from the live oaks lining Calhoun Street, casting long, languid shadows across the pastel-colored storefronts.  Amy's salon, "The Gilded Snip," nestled between a vintage bookstore and a praline shop, exuded a charming, old-world elegance.  Inside, the aroma of jasmine and bergamot mingled with the faint scent of hairspray, creating a comforting, almost hypnotic atmosphere. Sunlight streamed through the large, arched windows, illuminating the gleaming brass fixtures and the antique barber chairs lined up against the wall.  This Thursday morning, however, held a different kind of tension in the air, a stillness that had nothing to do with the usual calm before a busy day.  A single, wilting magnolia bloom lay on the doorstep, its creamy petals bruised and brown, a stark contrast to the vibrant hues that usually adorned Amy's world.
