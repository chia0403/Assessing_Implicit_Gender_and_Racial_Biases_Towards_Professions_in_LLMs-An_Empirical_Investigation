The fluorescent lights of Northwood High hummed a monotonous B-flat, a soundtrack to Amelia Hayes’s Tuesday morning.  Rain lashed against the large window of her office, blurring the already dreary view of the student parking lot.  Amelia, whose full name was Amelia Grace Hayes, tapped a chipped, flamingo-pink nail against a stack of college applications, each a testament to the anxieties and aspirations of the teenagers who shuffled through her cramped, book-lined space.  Northwood, nestled in the heart of the perpetually overcast town of Port Blossom, Oregon, wasn't exactly a hotbed of Ivy League dreams. Most kids here hoped for a scholarship to the local community college or, if they were particularly ambitious, a job at the lumber mill that dominated the town's economy and skyline.  This morning, the air in Amelia’s office was thick with the scent of damp wool and the faint, lingering aroma of the instant coffee she’d spilled earlier, a fitting metaphor for the day she already sensed brewing.
