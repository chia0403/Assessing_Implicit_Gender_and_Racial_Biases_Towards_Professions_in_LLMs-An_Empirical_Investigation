The bell above the door of "Nailed It," tinkled merrily, a counterpoint to the rhythmic whir of the nail drill. Rain lashed against the large window, blurring the neon glow of the "Open" sign and the grey afternoon into a hazy, impressionistic painting.  Eliza Jane Beaumont, her auburn hair pulled back in a neat chignon, paused her work on Mrs. Higgins's gel extensions and glanced up.  A figure, silhouetted against the downpour, hesitated in the doorway, dripping a small puddle onto the checkered floor. Nailed It, nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed fortune teller's on Bleaker Street, wasn't exactly known for its glamorous clientele, and Eliza braced herself for another chipped acrylic emergency or a desperate plea for a last-minute pedicure.  Little did she know, this rain-soaked stranger was about to change everything.
