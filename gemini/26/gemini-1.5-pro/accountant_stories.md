Rain lashed against the ornate, bay windows of Elias Thorne's office, blurring the already fading light of a late November afternoon in London.  Elias, a chartered accountant with a penchant for meticulously pressed suits and even more meticulously organized spreadsheets, tapped a perfectly sharpened pencil against his teeth. The mahogany desk in his small, but prestigious, office in Fitzrovia was cluttered, not with papers – those were all neatly filed – but with the detritus of a particularly perplexing problem:  half-eaten biscuits, a cold cup of tea, and a scattering of crumpled calculations.  The rhythmic ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner, a gift from his late father, usually a comforting sound, tonight felt like a mocking reminder of the rapidly approaching deadline. He had to find the discrepancy, a missing sum of £2.7 million, before the markets opened tomorrow, or the reputation of Sterling & Thorne, the firm he'd inherited and painstakingly built over the last decade, would be irrevocably tarnished.
