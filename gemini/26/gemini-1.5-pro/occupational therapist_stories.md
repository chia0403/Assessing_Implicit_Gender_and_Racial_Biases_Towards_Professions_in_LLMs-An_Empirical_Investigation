The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Reyes's dark hair across her face as she hurried across the cobblestone courtyard of Château de Verre, the frosted glass of the conservatory glimmering like an enormous gemstone in the twilight.

Amy, a newly arrived occupational therapist from Chicago, clutched her thin coat tighter, the chill seeping through despite the layers.  She was already second-guessing her impulsive decision to accept the position. Trading the familiar bustle of the city for the isolated grandeur of the French countryside had seemed romantic in theory, but the imposing shadows cast by the centuries-old chateau and the hushed whispers of the wind through the bare branches of the surrounding vineyards felt less enchanting and more... unsettling. The ornate iron gates clanged shut behind her with a finality that made her stomach clench. This was it. No turning back.
