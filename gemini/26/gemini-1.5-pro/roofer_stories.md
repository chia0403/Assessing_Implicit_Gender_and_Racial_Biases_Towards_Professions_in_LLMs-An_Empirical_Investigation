The sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Thorne's back, turning his already sweat-soaked shirt a darker shade of grey.  He squinted against the glare reflecting off the corrugated tin roof of Mrs. Henderson's General Store, the highest point in the sleepy, sun-baked town of Harmony Creek, Arizona.  Heat rippled off the asphalt shingles of the houses below, blurring the scene into a shimmering mirage. Harmony Creek might have lived up to its name during the milder months, but in July, it was more like Discord Gulch, every resident simmering just below boiling point. Eli adjusted his harness, the worn leather creaking a familiar tune against his shoulders, and gripped his hammer, the calloused skin of his hand molding around the worn wood.  The scent of tar and sun-baked metal hung heavy in the air, a smell Eli, after twenty years in the roofing business, found oddly comforting.  A hawk circled overhead, casting a fleeting shadow across the scorching tin, a silent observer in a town where secrets simmered hotter than the midday sun.
