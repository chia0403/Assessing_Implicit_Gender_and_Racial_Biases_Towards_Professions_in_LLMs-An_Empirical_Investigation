The brass handles of the revolving door spun with a rhythmic click-clack, spitting out tourists and businessmen alike into the opulent lobby of the Hotel Magnifique.  Sunlight streamed through the arched windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air above the plush, Persian rugs.  A towering arrangement of calla lilies perfumed the air with a heady, almost intoxicating, sweetness.  This was Bartholomew "Barty" Finch's domain, and he, in his crisp, burgundy uniform with gold braid, was its undisputed king.  Or, at least, king of the luggage carts and the service elevator. Barty, barely twenty years old but with the world-weariness of a seasoned traveler etched onto his freckled face, leaned against a marble pillar, subtly observing the new arrivals. He knew the look of a big tipper versus a cheapskate, the hurried anxiety of a businessman versus the leisurely excitement of a vacationer.  Tonight, the Hotel Magnifique was hosting the annual Diamond Gala, promising a night of glitz, glamour, and hopefully, for Barty, generous gratuities.  The air crackled with anticipation, and Barty straightened, ready to play his part in the grand theatre of the Magnifique.
