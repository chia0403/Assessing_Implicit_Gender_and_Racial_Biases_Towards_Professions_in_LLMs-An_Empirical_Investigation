The asphalt shimmered, a black river cutting through the ochre heart of the Arizona desert. Heat haze danced above it, blurring the distant mesas into wavering purple silhouettes.  Dust devils, skinny whirlwinds of grit and frustration, pirouetted across the deserted stretch of Highway 89, occasionally snagging at the bright orange cones that marked Amelia "Milly" Reyes's current domain.  Milly, her name stitched in faded yellow thread onto the breast pocket of her fluorescent vest, wiped a bead of sweat from beneath the brim of her hard hat. The sun, a malevolent eye in the bleached blue sky, beat down with relentless fury. It was only 9:00 am, but the temperature was already pushing triple digits.  Today's job: patching a particularly nasty pothole that threatened to swallow a small car whole.  Milly hefted her crowbar, the metal already hot to the touch, and sighed.  Another day, another battle against the ceaseless churn of the desert and the endless degradation of the highway.
