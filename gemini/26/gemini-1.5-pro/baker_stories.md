The aroma of burnt sugar and almonds hung heavy in the air, a bittersweet perfume that clung to the brick walls of Amelia "Millie" Dubois's bakery like a second skin. The Sweet Spot, nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually gloomy antique shop on Sycamore Street, was Millie's sanctuary.  Dawn painted the large, dusty windows a pale lavender, illuminating the rows of cooling pastries on wire racks and the worn, flour-dusted wooden table where Millie kneaded her magic. Outside, the sleepy town of Havenwood, Oregon, was just beginning to stir, the only sounds the distant rumble of a logging truck and the chirping of sparrows perched on the bakery's overflowing window boxes.  But inside, The Sweet Spot was already alive, a warm, yeasty haven against the chill of the early autumn morning.
