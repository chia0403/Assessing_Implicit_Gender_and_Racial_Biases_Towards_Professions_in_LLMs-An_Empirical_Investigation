The biting wind whipped around Elias Thorne as he unlocked the door to "Thorne's Tonsorial Parlour," the small brass nameplate rattling against the frosted glass.  It was a bleak December morning in the coastal town of Port Blossom, Maine. The usually vibrant harbour was subdued beneath a steel-grey sky, and the salty air carried the promise of snow. Inside, the parlour was a haven of warmth and the comforting aroma of bay rum and sandalwood.  Sunlight, weak as it was, filtered through the large front window, illuminating rows of gleaming cut-throat razors and the worn leather of the barber chairs.  Elias, a man built like an oak barrel with hands as steady as a surgeon's, switched on the crackling radio and surveyed his domain.  Christmas carols, slightly off-key, mingled with the hum of the ancient hot towel steamer.  It was the slowest week of the year, but for Elias, the quiet solitude was a welcome respite. He preferred the company of his honed tools and the silent stories whispered by the grain of the wood in his shop.
