The shop, nestled between a crooked bakery and a dusty antique store, was a haven, a riot of blossoms that defied the melancholic grey of the autumn evening outside.  Tonight, however, even Ameliaâ€™s usually cheerful demeanor was tinged with a nervous energy.  A delivery was expected, a particularly significant one, and the anticipation hung heavy in the air, thicker even than the scent of the lilies.
