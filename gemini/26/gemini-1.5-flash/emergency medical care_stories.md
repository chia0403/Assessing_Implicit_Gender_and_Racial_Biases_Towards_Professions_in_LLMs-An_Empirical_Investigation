The wail of the siren was a lullaby Amelia Hernandez knew intimately.  It vibrated through the worn-out upholstery of the ambulance, a counterpoint to the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the emergency lights strobing across the rain-slicked streets of Seattle.  The city, usually a breathtaking tapestry of glittering skyscrapers and shadowed alleyways, was tonight a blurry watercolor of greys and blacks, the deluge obscuring even the iconic Space Needle.  Amelia, her paramedicâ€™s uniform clinging damply to her, gripped the wheel with white knuckles, navigating the treacherous curves of Queen Anne Hill.  The rain hammered against the windshield, each drop a tiny percussion instrument in the symphony of urban chaos unfolding around her.  Tonight's call? A reported cardiac arrest, location: a crumbling Victorian mansion perched precariously on the edge of a cliff, accessible only by a narrow, treacherous road barely clinging to the hillside.  The dispatcher's voice, tight with urgency, still echoed in her ears: "Priority one, Hernandez.  Code Blue.  Be advised, access is extremely limited."
