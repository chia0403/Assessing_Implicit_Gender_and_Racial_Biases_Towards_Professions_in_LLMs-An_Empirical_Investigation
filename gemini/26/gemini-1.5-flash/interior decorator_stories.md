The chipped paint on the windowsill, a faded cerulean mirroring the stormy sky outside, was the first thing Aurelia Blackwood noticed.  It wasn't the crumbling plasterwork, nor the threadbare velvet curtains clinging to their rusted rods – those were to be expected in a house this neglected.  No, it was the *specific* shade of cerulean, a colour so heartbreakingly beautiful in its decay, that spoke volumes to Aurelia, a language only an interior decorator with twenty years’ experience could understand.  She stood on the threshold of Blackwood Manor, the rain plastering her auburn curls to her face, the scent of damp earth and decaying roses heavy in the air.  The manor itself, a gothic monstrosity of grey stone and brooding shadows, hunched against the relentless wind like a weary old beast, seemed to sigh a mournful welcome.  This wasn't just another restoration project; this felt...personal.
