The biting Antarctic wind howled a mournful song around Dr. Aris Thorne’s research station, a desolate symphony only punctuated by the rhythmic crackle of the aurora borealis dancing across the inky sky.  Ice, thick as a glacier’s heart, crunched underfoot as Aris, bundled in layers of thermal gear that did little to combat the sub-zero temperatures, hurried towards the main laboratory.  The air, thin and frigid, burned in his lungs with each rasping breath.  He hadn't felt this level of raw, primal cold since his ill-fated expedition to the Greenland ice sheet three years prior – an expedition that had nearly cost him his life and irrevocably altered his research focus.  Now, nestled precariously on the edge of the Ross Ice Shelf, his current project, the seemingly innocuous study of subglacial microbial life, felt far more significant, far more urgent, than ever before.
