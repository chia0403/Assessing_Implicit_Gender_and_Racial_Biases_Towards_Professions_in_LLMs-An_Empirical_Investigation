The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s hair across her face as she hurried down the cobbled street, the scent of woodsmoke and brine heavy in the air.  She tugged her worn wool coat tighter, the collar scratching against her already chapped cheeks.  The grey light of the late afternoon cast long shadows from the crooked, gabled houses that lined the harbour in the small, windswept town of Port Blossom, Maine.  Amelia, a physician’s assistant at the town’s only clinic – a charming but decidedly antiquated building smelling perpetually of antiseptic and old linoleum – was late.  Again.  Not that anyone in Port Blossom seemed to mind; punctuality was a luxury afforded to those who didn't wrestle with the vagaries of the Maine coastline on a daily basis.  But even the famously tolerant Dr. Elias Thorne, her mentor and boss, might have something to say about her tardiness this time.  The emergency call had been urgent – a suspected case of severe hypothermia – and the icy grip of the Atlantic seemed determined to keep Amelia from reaching her patient.
