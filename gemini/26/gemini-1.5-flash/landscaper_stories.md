The midday sun beat down on Elias Thorne's neck, turning the sweat clinging to his brow into a shimmering, salty film.  He wiped it away with the back of his calloused hand, leaving a dark smudge on his already dust-caked skin.  The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of parched earth and the faint, sweet decay of overripe plums from Mrs. Gable's neglected orchard next door.  Elias, owner and sole operator of Thorne's Green Thumb Landscaping, surveyed his current project: a sprawling, neglected Victorian garden, choked with weeds taller than his waist and overrun with ivy that clawed at the crumbling stone walls like grasping fingers.  The house itself, a somber grey under the relentless sun, seemed to sigh under the weight of its own forgotten grandeur, mirroring the exhaustion Elias felt settling deep in his bones.
