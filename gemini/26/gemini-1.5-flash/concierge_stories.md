The brass nameplate gleamed under the low-hanging chandelier:  *Aurelia "Relly" Davenport, Concierge*.  Relly adjusted the silk scarf at her throat, the midnight blue a stark contrast to the opulent, almost garishly gilded lobby of the Blackwood Hotel.  Rain lashed against the towering gothic windows, the sound a muted percussion against the hushed whispers of the wealthy guests who drifted past.  Each one, a character in a silent drama unfolding within the velvet ropes and marble floors of this architectural behemoth, a place where fortunes were made and broken, secrets whispered, and lives meticulously curated. Tonight, the air crackled with an unusual tension – a tremor in the usually impeccable façade of the Blackwood, a feeling Relly, with her years of experience reading the subtle shifts in human behaviour, recognized instantly as something far more significant than a cancelled reservation.
