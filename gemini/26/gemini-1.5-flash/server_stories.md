The chipped Formica tabletop felt slick under Amelia Hernandez's fingertips as she wiped it down, the scent of stale beer and yesterday's spilled coffee clinging stubbornly to the air.  Dust motes, illuminated by the harsh fluorescent lights humming overhead, danced in the sluggish currents created by the rotating ceiling fan.  Amelia, all sharp angles and weary eyes beneath a perpetually messy bun, sighed, the sound swallowed by the low thrum of conversation and the clatter of cutlery from the other booths in "The Rusty Mug," a diner clinging precariously to life on the wrong side of the tracks.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, a relentless percussion accompanying the melancholic tune spilling from the jukebox in the corner.  Tonight, like most nights, promised little more than lukewarm coffee and the sting of another ungrateful customer.
