The chipped paint of the windowsill dug into Elara Genevieve Blackwood’s elbows as she stared out at the churning grey expanse of the North Sea.  October wind, a relentless sculptor, carved patterns into the waves, mirroring the chaotic thoughts swirling in her mind.

The smell of salt and seaweed, usually comforting, only served to accentuate the emptiness within.
