The biting wind, a relentless sculptor itself, whipped across the craggy peaks of the Mourne Mountains, carrying with it the scent of peat smoke and the mournful cry of a curlew.  Below, nestled in a valley carved by centuries of glacial erosion, lay the village of Carrickfergus.  Here, amidst the grey stone houses huddled together for warmth, lived Elias O'Connell, a man whose life was as hard and unforgiving as the granite he shaped.  Elias, his knuckles permanently stained ochre from the earth and his eyes the colour of a stormy sea, sat hunched over his workbench, the rhythmic clang of his hammer against chisel a counterpoint to the howling wind.  His workshop, a low-slung stone structure barely larger than a cart shed, was filled with the dust of ages, the air thick with the scent of whetstones and the earthy tang of freshly cut stone.  The unfinished head of an angel, its face still trapped within the unforgiving grey, lay waiting patiently for Elias's touch.
