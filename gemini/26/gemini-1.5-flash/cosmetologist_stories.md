The scent of coconut and vanilla hung heavy in the air, a cloying sweetness that usually calmed Isabella “Izzy” Rodriguez, but tonight, it only amplified the tremor in her hands.  Izzy, owner and sole operator of “Izzy’s Glam Shack,” a tiny but vibrant salon tucked away on a cobbled side street in the heart of the historic French Quarter of New Orleans, stared at the spilled contents of her best client’s expensive hair-dye kit.  Crimson, emerald, and sapphire streaks of color bled into each other on the worn, wooden floorboards, mirroring the chaotic mess of emotions churning within her.  Rain lashed against the stained-glass windowpanes, casting flickering shadows that danced with the gaslight illuminating the small space, turning the already intimate salon into a claustrophobic kaleidoscope of color and anxiety. Tonight, however, the vibrant hues of the French Quarter held no charm; only the stark, unforgiving reality of a ruined dye job and a potentially ruined reputation.
