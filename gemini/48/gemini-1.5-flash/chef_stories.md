The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of frying garlic and simmering spices, a fragrant counterpoint to the metallic tang of blood clinging stubbornly to the cobblestones of Marrakech's Djemaa el-Fna square.  A lone stray cat, its fur the color of burnt cinnamon, stalked a discarded chicken bone near the overflowing bins.

Her own stall, "Aisha's Kitchen," was a vibrant splash of color amidst the muted tones of the square, its bright terracotta tiles gleaming under the fading sun.  Tonight, however, the usual comforting rhythm of her kitchen felt off-kilter, a dissonant note in the otherwise familiar symphony of the marketplace.
