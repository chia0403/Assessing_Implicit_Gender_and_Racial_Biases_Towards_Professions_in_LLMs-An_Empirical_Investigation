The stale scent of sweat and linoleum hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Amelia “Amy” Hernandez.  Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the mirrored walls of "Body & Soul Fitness," reflecting back a room full of glistening bodies, each a testament to Amy's rigorous 6 AM boot camp.  Rain lashed against the panoramic windows overlooking the grey, churning waters of Puget Sound, a stark contrast to the internal furnace Amy had ignited within her clients.  The rhythmic thump of bass from her carefully curated playlist vibrated through the floor, a counterpoint to the grunts and gasps of exertion echoing around the cavernous studio.  Amy, herself a whirlwind of controlled energy in her signature neon-pink leggings and sweat-wicking tank top, adjusted the microphone clipped to her shirt, a steely glint in her eye as she surveyed her troops.  Today's session was going to be brutal, even by her standards.
