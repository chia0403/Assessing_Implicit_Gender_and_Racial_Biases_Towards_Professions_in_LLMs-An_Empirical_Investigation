The fluorescent lights of the St. Jude's Medical Center phlebotomy lab hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* of Amelia Hernandez's own heartbeat.  It was a sound she'd become intimately familiar with over the past five years, a steady drumbeat accompanying the countless veins she’d accessed, the countless vials she’d filled, the countless lives she’d indirectly touched.  This Tuesday morning, however, the usual clinical calm was fractured.  A tense energy crackled in the air, thick as the antiseptic smell clinging to everything in the sterile room.  Amelia, her usual efficiency slightly frayed, nervously tapped a perfectly manicured fingernail against the polished countertop, her gaze drifting to the overflowing requisition basket – a silent testament to the chaos brewing just beyond the lab's frosted glass doors.
