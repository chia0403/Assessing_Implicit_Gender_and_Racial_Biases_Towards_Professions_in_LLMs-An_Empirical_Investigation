The scent of aged paper and leather hung heavy in the air, a comforting perfume only Amelia Katherine Finch truly appreciated.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the gothic arched window of the Blackwood Memorial Library, danced in the stillness.  Amelia, her spectacles perched halfway down her nose, meticulously cataloged a first edition of Tennyson, her nimble fingers tracing the delicate gold lettering on the cover. Outside, the relentless November rain lashed against the stained-glass windows, a rhythmic counterpoint to the gentle scratch of her pen on the index card.  Blackwood, a town steeped in history and shrouded in mist more often than not, held its secrets close, secrets Amelia suspected were tucked away, not just between the pages of its ancient tomes, but within the very stones of the library itself.
