The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of iron and brine, a familiar perfume to Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield.  It clung to him like a second skin, this aroma of blood and salt, the olfactory signature of his life's work.  Barty stood behind the worn oak counter of Butterfield's Meats, his apron stained a mosaic of crimson and ochre, the chill morning air doing little to lessen the dampness clinging to his brow.  Outside, the cobbled streets of Oakhaven were still mostly deserted, the pre-dawn gloom barely pierced by the weak gaslights sputtering their last breaths. Only the rhythmic clang of the butcher's cleaver, echoing in the small shop, broke the quiet anticipation of the day.  Dust motes danced in the pale light filtering through the grimy windowpanes, illuminating the rows of glistening sausages, the plump cuts of beef, and the pale carcasses hanging from the hooks high above, silently awaiting their fate.
