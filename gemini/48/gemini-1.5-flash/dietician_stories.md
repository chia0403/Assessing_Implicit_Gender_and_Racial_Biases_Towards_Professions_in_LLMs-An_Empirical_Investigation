The fluorescent hum of the hospital cafeteria buzzed in Dr. Eleanor Vance's ears like a swarm of disgruntled bees.  Eleanor, a registered dietician with a perpetually tired smile and a penchant for sensible cardigan sweaters, meticulously arranged a plate of meticulously portioned steamed broccoli and grilled chicken breast.  The pale green of the broccoli clashed horribly with the sterile white of the tray, a visual metaphor for the battle she fought daily â€“ the war against blandness, against uninspired hospital food, and, ultimately, against the insidious creep of malnutrition in her patients.  The air hung heavy with the scent of disinfectant and overcooked vegetables, a fragrance as familiar to her as her own reflection.  This wasn't just a job; it was the battlefield where she fought for the health and wellbeing of souls trapped within these sterile walls. The rhythmic beep of heart monitors from the nearby ward punctuated the silence, a constant reminder of the fragility of life and the crucial role she played in its sustenance.
