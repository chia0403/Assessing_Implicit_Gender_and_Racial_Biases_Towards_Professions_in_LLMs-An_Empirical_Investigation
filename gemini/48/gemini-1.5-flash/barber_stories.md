The scent of Bay Rum hung heavy in the air, a thick, comforting perfume clinging to the worn leather chairs and the dust motes dancing in the afternoon sunbeams that slanted through the grimy window of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's Barber Shop.  Barty, a man whose face resembled a well-loved leather satchel – all creases and comfortable familiarity – hummed a low, mournful tune as he expertly wielded his straight razor, the blade a silver flash against the charcoal stubble of Mr. Fitzwilliam's jowls.  Outside, the relentless rhythm of the city – the clang of trolley cars, the honk of impatient taxis, the murmur of a thousand hurried conversations – faded into a muted background hum within the sanctuary of Barty's shop, a tiny island of calm in the churning sea of 1920s Chicago.
