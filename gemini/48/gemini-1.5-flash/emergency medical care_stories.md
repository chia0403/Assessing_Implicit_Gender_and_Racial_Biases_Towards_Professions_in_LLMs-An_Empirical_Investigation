The biting wind whipped Amelia “Amy” Hernandez’s dark hair across her face as she wrestled the heavy emergency medical services bag from the back of the ambulance.  The salt spray from the churning grey Atlantic lashed against her cheeks, stinging the already raw chapped skin.  She pulled her fleece jacket tighter, the flimsy barrier offering little protection against the November gale that roared across the desolate stretch of beach known locally as Widow’s Walk.  The air smelled of brine, seaweed, and something faintly metallic – a scent Amy knew all too well.  The battered, rust-orange lifeguard tower stood silhouetted against the stormy sky, a lonely sentinel overlooking the churning waves that relentlessly gnawed at the sand.  This was it:  the edge of the world, and Amy Hernandez’s usual Friday night.
