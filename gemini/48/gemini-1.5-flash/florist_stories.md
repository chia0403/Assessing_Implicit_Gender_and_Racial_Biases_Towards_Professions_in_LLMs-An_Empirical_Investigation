The scent of rain-soaked petrichor mingled with the heady perfume of lilies and jasmine, a fragrant cocktail only Amelia Katherine Thistlewick truly appreciated.  It hung heavy in the air above "Petals & Promises," her small, ivy-covered shop nestled on a cobbled lane tucked away from the bustling heart of Charleston, South Carolina.  Rain lashed against the leaded-glass windows, blurring the already fading light of a late autumn afternoon.  Inside, the shop was a riot of colour â€“ crimson roses jostled with deep purple asters, the vibrant hues a stark contrast to the grey gloom outside.  Amelia, her hands stained a delicate shade of emerald from handling orchids, hummed a low tune as she meticulously arranged a bouquet of fiery autumn leaves and creamy white chrysanthemums.  The ticking of the old grandfather clock in the corner was the only other sound besides the relentless drumming of the rain.
