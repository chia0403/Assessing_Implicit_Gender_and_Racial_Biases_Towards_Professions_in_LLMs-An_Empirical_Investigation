The biting Montana wind howled a mournful song around Ezekiel "Zeke" Stone's rig, a symphony of icy grit against polished steel.  He hunched deeper into his worn leather jacket, the collar pulled high to shield his face from the stinging sleet.  The cab of his eighteen-wheeler, a battered but reliable Kenworth named "Betsy," was a refuge from the storm raging outside, but even Betsy's sturdy frame groaned under the weight of the relentless blizzard.  Zeke, his face etched with the weariness of countless miles and sleepless nights, sipped lukewarm coffee, its bitter taste doing little to warm him from the inside. He was parked on a desolate stretch of I-90, somewhere between Bozeman and Billings, the only light for miles emanating from Betsy's dashboard and the faint, ethereal glow of the aurora borealis dancing across the inky sky.  The radio crackled with static, a fitting soundtrack to his lonely vigil, a testament to the isolating beauty and unforgiving nature of the vast, snow-covered landscape.
