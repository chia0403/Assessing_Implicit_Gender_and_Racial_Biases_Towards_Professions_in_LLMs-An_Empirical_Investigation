The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow across Amelia Hernandez's rain-slicked trench coat.  The air hung heavy with the scent of stale beer and desperation, a familiar perfume to Amelia, an accountant whose office was, ironically, located in the sun-drenched, sterile heights of a skyscraper overlooking this very street.  Tonight, however, Amelia wasn't reviewing quarterly reports; tonight, she was chasing a ghost â€“ a ghost of a missing million dollars, hidden somewhere within the labyrinthine financial records of her latest client, the notoriously shady proprietor of the Rusty Mug itself.  The rain hammered against the grimy windowpanes, mirroring the relentless drumming of anxiety in her chest.  This wasn't just another audit; this was a descent into the underbelly of the city, a gamble that could either make her career or break her completely.
