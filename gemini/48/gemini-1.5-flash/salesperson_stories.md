The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia “Amy” Hawthorne’s hands, a paltry comfort against the November chill biting through the drafty window of her cramped office.  Rain lashed against the glass, mimicking the relentless drumming of anxiety in her chest.  Amy wasn’t worried about the weather, though the impending storm mirrored her own.

The office itself was a testament to budget cuts: peeling paint, flickering fluorescent lights, and the faint scent of stale coffee perpetually clinging to the air, a fitting aroma for the stale sales figures Amy was staring at.  Outside, the grey cityscape of Birmingham, Alabama, sprawled under a bruised sky, a mirror to her own fading optimism.  Today was the day she had to meet her sales quota, or face the consequences.
