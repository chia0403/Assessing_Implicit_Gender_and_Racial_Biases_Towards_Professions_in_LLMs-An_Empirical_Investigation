The scent of argan oil and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Seraphina “Sera” Moreau.  Rain lashed against the oversized windows of her salon, "Shear Genius," blurring the neon glow of the city lights into shimmering streaks of colour.  Inside, however, the atmosphere was a comforting balm against the storm raging outside.  Soft jazz hummed from hidden speakers, a counterpoint to the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of Sera’s shears as she sculpted a client’s unruly mane into a cascade of auburn waves.  Shear Genius wasn't just a salon; it was a sanctuary, tucked away on a quiet side street in the bustling heart of New Orleans’s French Quarter, a haven where the anxieties of the outside world melted away under the warmth of a blow dryer and the promise of a perfect hairstyle.  Tonight, however, even the usual tranquil hum of the salon felt charged, a sense of unease prickling at Sera’s skin, as sharp and unexpected as the sudden crack of thunder that reverberated through the building.
