The salt spray stung Amelia Jean Blackwood's face, a familiar kiss from the unforgiving Atlantic.  She braced herself against the relentless wind whipping across the desolate, windswept cliffs of Cornwall, the grey sky mirroring the turbulent emotions churning within her.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and the faint, earthy tang of decaying seaweed, did little to soothe her frayed nerves.  Her tripod, a steadfast companion on countless shoots, trembled slightly under the onslaught, mirroring the shaky ground beneath her worn leather boots. Amelia adjusted the settings on her battered Hasselblad 500CM, the familiar weight comforting in its solidity.  Below her, the churning sea, a restless beast of sapphire and emerald, crashed against the jagged rocks, a breathtaking yet terrifying spectacle. This was her canvas, the wild Cornish coast, and tonight, it felt particularly unforgiving, reflecting the turmoil in her own heart.
