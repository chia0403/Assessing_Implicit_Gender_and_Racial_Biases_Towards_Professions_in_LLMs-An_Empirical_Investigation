The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Jack Stratton’s office, a relentless percussion accompanying the even more relentless drip, drip, drip from a leak somewhere near the ceiling.  Jack, a man whose trench coat perpetually seemed one rain-soaked sigh away from disintegration, stared out at the neon-drenched alleyway below.  His office, perched precariously on the third floor of a crumbling building in the perpetually twilight district of Grimsborough, was less a sanctuary and more a testament to his unwavering commitment to accepting any case, regardless of its inherent grime. The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee, cheap cigarettes, and a peculiar metallic tang that Jack suspected came from the overflowing dumpster across the street.  Tonight, however, the metallic tang was overpowered by the sharp, almost floral aroma of something distinctly…unnatural.
