The chipped paint of the windowsill was cold against Elara Vance’s cheek, the pre-dawn light painting the Parisian street below in shades of bruised plum and charcoal.  Rain, a fine, persistent drizzle, kissed the cobblestones, a counterpoint to the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Elara’s fingers on her laptop keyboard.  Her tiny, attic apartment, perched precariously above a boulangerie that smelled perpetually of warm bread and something vaguely floral, was a chaotic symphony of overflowing bookshelves, scattered papers covered in illegible scrawl, and empty café au lait cups.  The only hint of order was a single, flickering candle on her writing desk, casting long shadows that danced with the Parisian rain’s melancholic rhythm.  Elara, a writer whose imagination thrived in the twilight hours, found solace in this charming, if somewhat disorganized, chaos.  This was her sanctuary, her Paris. And tonight, or rather, this morning, she was finally going to finish her novel.
