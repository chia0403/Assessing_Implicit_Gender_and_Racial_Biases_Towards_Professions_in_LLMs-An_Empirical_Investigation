The biting Montana wind whipped at Amelia “Amy” Blackwood’s parka as she wrestled the joystick of the D9 bulldozer.  Below, the frozen ground of the Yellowstone River valley cracked and groaned under the machine’s immense weight.  January’s grip held the landscape in a vise of ice and snow; the only sound louder than the bulldozer’s growl was the relentless shriek of the wind tearing through the skeletal branches of the cottonwood trees lining the riverbank.  Amy, her breath frosting in the frigid air, squinted at the GPS coordinates flashing on the in-cab monitor.  The new access road to the geothermal plant was proving tougher than anticipated; a layer of permafrost, unforgiving and stubborn, lay hidden beneath the deceptively shallow snowpack.  This wasn't just another job; this was Amy's chance to prove herself, to finally escape the shadow of her father’s legacy and forge her own path in this unforgiving, breathtaking land.
