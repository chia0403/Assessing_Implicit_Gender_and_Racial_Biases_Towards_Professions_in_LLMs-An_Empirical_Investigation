The biting November wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vance’s auburn hair across her face as she hurried across the deserted school playground.  Fallen leaves, the color of bruised plums and rusting copper, skittered before her like frantic, tiny animals.  Oakwood Middle School loomed before her, a gothic behemoth of grey stone and echoing hallways, silhouetted against the bruised purple twilight.  Inside, the fluorescent lights hummed a discordant lullaby, a stark contrast to the howling wind that clawed at the aging brickwork.  Eleanor, bundled in a thick wool coat despite the indoor heat, felt the familiar chill of the building sink into her bones – a chill that had nothing to do with the temperature.  It was the chill of unspoken anxieties, of simmering resentments, and of secrets held tight within the hearts of the children who called Oakwood home.  Tonight, however, the usual hum of adolescent turmoil felt amplified, sharpened to a dangerous edge.  Something felt…wrong.
