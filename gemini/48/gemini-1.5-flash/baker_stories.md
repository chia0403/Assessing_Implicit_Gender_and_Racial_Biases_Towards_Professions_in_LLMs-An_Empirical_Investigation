The pre-dawn chill clung to Amelia Hawthorne like a damp shawl as she unlocked the bakery doors.  Frost, delicate as spun sugar, clung to the windowpanes of "The Flour Child," its icy breath blurring the already dim gaslight illuminating the cobbled street outside.  The air, thick with the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth, was punctuated only by the distant clang of a blacksmith's hammer and the rhythmic squeak of Amelia's own boots on the worn flagstones.  Inside, the warmth of the still-sleeping oven offered a tempting promise of comfort, a stark contrast to the biting November wind howling a mournful song around the eaves.  The air within, however, was already alive with the sweet, yeasty tang of rising sourdough, a comforting aroma that had been Amelia's constant companion for nearly twenty years.
