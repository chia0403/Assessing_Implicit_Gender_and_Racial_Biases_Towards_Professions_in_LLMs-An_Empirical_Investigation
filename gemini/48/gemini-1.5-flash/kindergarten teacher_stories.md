The aroma of stale crayons and slightly-too-sweet apple juice hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Ms. Eleanor Vance.  Sunlight, fractured by the rainbow-hued mobiles swaying gently from the classroom ceiling, dappled the worn wooden floorboards.  Dust motes, illuminated like tiny stars, danced in the golden beams.  It was a Tuesday, the second Tuesday of October, and for Ms. Vance, already buried under a mountain of construction paper cutouts and half-finished finger paintings, it felt less like the beginning of a week and more like the beginning of a very long, very sticky siege. Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the windows of Sunny Meadows Kindergarten, a tune that seemed to perfectly mirror the low hum of impending chaos emanating from the hallway.
