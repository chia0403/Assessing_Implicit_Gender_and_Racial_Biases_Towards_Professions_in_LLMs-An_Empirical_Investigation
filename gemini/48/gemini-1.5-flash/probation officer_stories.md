The chipped paint of the probation office’s waiting room peeled like sunburnt skin, mirroring the slow, agonizing unraveling of Elias Thorne’s patience.  He’d been staring at the cracked linoleum, counting the scuff marks left by countless worn shoes, for the past fifteen minutes.  Elias wasn't one for waiting; his schedule, meticulously organized and colour-coded on his ancient PalmPilot, didn’t allow for such indulgences.  But today, the usual controlled chaos of his job as a probation officer for the city of Oakhaven – a sprawling, sun-drenched coastal town perpetually teetering on the edge of picturesque and dilapidated – felt amplified tenfold. The air hung heavy with the scent of cheap coffee and simmering resentment, the familiar hum of fluorescent lights buzzing in his ears like restless wasps.  Outside, the Pacific Ocean roared its displeasure against the cliffs, a constant reminder of the unforgiving power of nature, and the similarly unforgiving nature of the people he oversaw.  His next appointment, a repeat offender named  Kevin Riley, was already late, and Elias had a sinking feeling that this lateness wasn't accidental.
