The fluorescent lights of "Apex Industries" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Katherine "Amy" Finch's otherwise silent existence behind the pristine reception desk.  Dust motes, illuminated like tiny galaxies, danced in the sterile air conditioning.  Amy, perched on her ergonomic chair, its supportive curves doing little to alleviate the dull ache in her lower back, meticulously organized the overflowing stationery drawer â€“ a small rebellion against the tedium of yet another Monday morning. The scent of cheap coffee, perpetually brewing in the break room, mingled with the faint antiseptic tang of the recently polished floors, creating a uniquely corporate aroma.  Outside, the relentless Chicago wind howled, a wild contrast to the hushed, almost suffocating calm within the glass and steel edifice of Apex Industries.  This was Amy's world, a world of perfectly aligned pens, polite but strained smiles, and the endless stream of visitors, each with their own agenda, their own reasons for seeking entry into the hallowed halls of Apex.
