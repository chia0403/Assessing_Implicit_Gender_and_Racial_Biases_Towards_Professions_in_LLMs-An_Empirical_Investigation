The scent of lavender and old silk hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume clinging to the dusty velvet curtains and the worn mahogany of the worktable.  Sunlight, fractured by the leaded-glass windowpanes of Aurelia Antoinette Beaumont’s atelier, dappled the bolts of fabric stacked against the walls – a riot of colour in shades ranging from the deepest midnight blue to the palest blush pink.  Dust motes, illuminated in the golden beams, danced like tiny, glittering fairies around Aurelia, who hunched over a half-finished gown, her nimble fingers wrestling with a particularly stubborn pleat.  Her atelier, nestled on a cobbled side street in the heart of the ancient city of Prague, was a sanctuary, a world apart from the bustling, hurried life beyond its thick, oak door.  Outside, the sound of horse-drawn carriages and the chattering of passersby was a muted hum, barely audible above the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of Aurelia’s shears.
