The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Amy” Hernandez’s hair across her face as she surveyed the desolate soccer field.  Dead leaves, the color of rusting pennies, skittered across the uneven turf, swirling around the abandoned goalposts like miniature, frantic spirits.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and decaying vegetation, a stark contrast to the vibrant green of the summer months when this very field had throbbed with the energy of her undefeated junior varsity team, the Lady Hawks.  Now, under the bruised purple of the twilight sky, it was a testament to the passing season, and a chilling reflection of the emptiness Amy felt inside.  The championship banner, still proudly flapping in the wind, felt like a cruel mockery of her current circumstances.  This wasn't just any field; it was her sanctuary, her battleground, and tonight, it felt like a mausoleum.
