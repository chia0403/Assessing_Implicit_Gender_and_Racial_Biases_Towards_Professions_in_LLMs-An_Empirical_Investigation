The biting November wind whipped Amelia Hernandez’s hair across her face as she wrestled a recalcitrant bale of hay.  The scent of damp earth and pine needles, usually comforting, was overwhelmed tonight by the sharper tang of woodsmoke and something faintly metallic – the ever-present aroma of the injured wildlife refuge where she worked.  Amelia, her breath puffing out in white clouds, heaved the hay onto the rickety wooden cart, its wheels groaning a mournful protest against the uneven ground.  The refuge, nestled deep within the Redwood National Park, was a cluster of repurposed cabins and makeshift enclosures, a sanctuary carved out of the ancient forest itself.  Tonight, the shadows stretched long and menacing between the towering redwoods, their bare branches clawing at the bruised twilight sky.  The usual comforting sounds of the forest – the rustle of leaves, the hoot of an owl – were muted by the impending storm, replaced by an unsettling silence broken only by the mournful creak of the old cart.
