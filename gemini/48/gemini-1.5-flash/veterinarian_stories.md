The biting November wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vanceâ€™s auburn hair across her face as she wrestled the heavy oak door of the Alder Creek Animal Clinic open.  The scent of pine and damp earth, usually comforting, was today overshadowed by the metallic tang of blood, faint but persistent, clinging to the air like a stubborn shadow.

The single flickering lamp outside cast long, dancing shadows, exaggerating the already imposing silhouette of the clinic, a weathered wooden structure that had seen better days, but had also witnessed countless acts of healing and heartbreaking farewells.  Inside, the warmth promised by the glowing windows felt a long way off, as if separated by a chasm of foreboding.
