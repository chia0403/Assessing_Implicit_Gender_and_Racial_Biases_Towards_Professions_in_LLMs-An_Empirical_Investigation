The salt spray stung Elara Vance's face as she wrestled the stubborn fishing net onto the weathered wooden dock.  Gulls cried overhead, their calls a counterpoint to the rhythmic crash of waves against the jagged rocks of the Cornish coastline.  Elara, a registered occupational therapist with sun-kissed skin and hands perpetually marked by the lingering scent of antiseptic and seaweed, adjusted the heavy net, its mesh snagged on a sharp barnacle.  This wasn't exactly the typical setting for her work, but then again, nothing about her current patient, Finnigan O'Malley, was typical.  The quaint, if slightly dilapidated, fishing village of Portwenn clung to the cliffside like a stubborn limpet, its brightly painted houses a vibrant contrast to the grey, brooding sea.  The air, thick with the smell of brine and diesel, carried a hint of woodsmoke from the chimneys of the cottages nestled amongst the narrow, winding streets.  Today, Elara's therapy session was about to begin, not in a sterile clinic, but against the backdrop of the wild, untamed beauty of the Atlantic.
