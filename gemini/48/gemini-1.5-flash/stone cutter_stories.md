The rasp of granite against steel was a familiar lullaby to Elias Thorne.  Dust, fine as powdered sugar, motes dancing in the weak winter sun that filtered through the grimy windows of his workshop, clung to his beard and the worn leather apron tied around his broad waist.  The air hung thick with the scent of damp earth and sharp stone, a smell Elias had breathed since he was a boy, a smell that clung to him like the granite dust, a permanent part of his very being.  His workshop, nestled in the shadow of the imposing grey cliffs that formed the backbone of the coastal town of Port Blossom, was a chaotic symphony of half-finished sculptures, discarded chisels, and the ever-present whisper of the restless sea crashing against the rocks below.  The rhythmic clang of his hammer against the chisel, a counterpoint to the ocean's roar, was the soundtrack to his life, a life lived slowly, deliberately, in the shadow of giants, both literal and metaphorical.
