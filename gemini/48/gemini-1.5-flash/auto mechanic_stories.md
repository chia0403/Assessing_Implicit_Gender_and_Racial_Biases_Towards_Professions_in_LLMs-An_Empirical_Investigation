The wrench slipped in Amelia Hernandez’s grease-stained hand, clattering onto the concrete floor of Hernandez Auto Repair with a clang that echoed unnaturally loud in the pre-dawn quiet.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single bare bulb hanging above her workbench, danced in the weak light.  The air hung thick with the scent of motor oil, burnt coffee, and something vaguely metallic that Amelia couldn’t quite place – probably a hint of ozone from the last time she'd had to jump-start a particularly stubborn pickup truck.  Outside, the desert wind whispered through the gaps in the corrugated iron walls of her shop, a lonely counterpoint to the rhythmic tick-tock of the old grandfather clock in the corner, a relic from her grandfather, the shop's founder.  It was 4:17 AM, and Amelia, already coated in grime despite having only been working for fifteen minutes, was already behind schedule.  The day promised to be as brutally hot and unforgiving as the Arizona sun itself.
