The fluorescent lights of the drafting room hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic scratch of Amelia Katherine Hawthorneâ€™s pencil on tracing paper.  Dust motes danced in the pale yellow glow, illuminated like tiny galaxies swirling above the meticulously organized chaos of her desk.  Architectural blueprints, their lines precise and unwavering, spilled over the edges, a testament to weeks spent meticulously designing the new city library.  The air, thick with the scent of stale coffee and the faint chemical tang of drafting film, clung to the heavy velvet curtains that did little to block out the late afternoon sun, which cast long shadows across the aged oak floor. Amelia, her dark hair pulled back in a practical braid, barely noticed the fading light. Her focus remained entirely on the intricate detail of a stained-glass rose window, painstakingly rendered in delicate pencil strokes.  Outside, the city of Philadelphia hummed with life, oblivious to the quiet concentration within the walls of the aging architectural firm, where Amelia Hawthorne, a woman of quiet determination and unparalleled skill, continued her work.
