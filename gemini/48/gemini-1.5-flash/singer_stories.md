The chipped porcelain teacup warmed Amelia Katherine Blackwood's fingers, a stark contrast to the icy November wind rattling the single-pane windows of her attic studio.  Rain lashed against the slates, a relentless percussion accompanying the melancholic melody drifting from her worn-out upright piano. Dust motes danced in the weak beam of a single bare bulb, illuminating the chaos of sheet music, half-finished lyrics scrawled on napkins, and discarded scarves – a testament to the tempestuous creativity that Amelia, better known as simply "Mia" on the dimly lit stages of the city's backstreet bars, poured into her craft.  The attic, nestled high in the eaves of a crumbling Victorian house overlooking the grimy harbour of Grimsborough, was her sanctuary, her refuge from the cacophony of the city and the even louder echoes of a past she couldn’t quite escape.
