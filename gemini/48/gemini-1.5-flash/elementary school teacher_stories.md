It wasn't the children – bless their crayon-stained hearts – but the relentless, suffocating weight of standardized testing, endless paperwork, and the gnawing feeling that she was failing to reach the bright, curious minds entrusted to her care.  The fluorescent lights of Ashwood Elementary hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the quiet desperation that settled over her each Monday morning like a damp wool blanket.  Outside, the November wind howled a mournful counterpoint, rattling the ancient windows of the school, a building that felt as old and weary as she sometimes did.  The scent of stale coffee and over-ripe apples hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume of another impending day of battling multiplication tables and spelling tests, and the ever-present fear that the joy she once found in teaching had completely vanished.
