The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Mia" Davenport's perfectly coiffed auburn bob across her face as she hurried down Wall Street, the canyons of steel and glass looming like indifferent giants.

The flashing ticker tape, usually a source of exhilaration, seemed to mock her with its relentless, indifferent scroll.
