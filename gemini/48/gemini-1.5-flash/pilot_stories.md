The radio crackled with static, a dissonant counterpoint to the relentless wind, offering no solace, only the unnerving silence between bursts of interference.  She was far from civilization, far from anything resembling help, and the fuel gauge was flirting dangerously close to empty.  Her mission, a seemingly simple medical supply run to a remote village nestled deep within the mountains, had become a desperate fight for survival.
