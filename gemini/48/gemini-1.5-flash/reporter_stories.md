The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Mia” Hernandez’s hair across her face, stinging her cheeks a fiery red.  She tugged her worn wool coat tighter, the collar scratching against her already chapped skin.

Mia, a seasoned reporter for the *New York Chronicle*, knew that smell.  It was the smell of trouble, and tonight, trouble was brewing in the heart of the Village.
