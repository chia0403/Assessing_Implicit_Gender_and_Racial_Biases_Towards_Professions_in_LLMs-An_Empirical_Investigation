The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Eleanor Vance as she hurried across the deserted hospital parking lot, the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks clawing at the bruised twilight sky.  St. Jude's General, a gothic monstrosity of grey stone and leaded windows, loomed before her, its silhouette stark against the fading light.  Inside, the emergency room hummed with a low, almost frantic energy – a symphony of beeping monitors, hushed whispers, and the clatter of medical equipment.  Tonight, however, the usual cacophony felt amplified, charged with an almost palpable sense of dread that clung to the air like the clinging dampness of a coastal fog.  Eleanor shivered, pulling her threadbare coat tighter around her, the chill seeping deeper than the November air.  It was a feeling she’d come to recognize in the past few weeks – a premonition of something terrible about to happen.
