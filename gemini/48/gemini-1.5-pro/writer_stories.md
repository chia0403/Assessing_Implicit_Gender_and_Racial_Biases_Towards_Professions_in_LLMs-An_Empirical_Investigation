The salt spray stung Amelia Thorne's face as she leaned against the weathered railing of her balcony, the rhythmic crash of waves against the cliffs below a constant, almost hypnotic, backdrop to her writer's block. Her cottage, perched precariously on the edge of the windswept Cornish coast near the tiny village of Portwenn, was usually a haven of inspiration.  Named "Seawhisper," its walls, thick with the stories of generations of fishermen and smugglers, normally hummed with creative energy.  But today, the only hum Amelia heard was the persistent, irritating one in her own head, a symphony of self-doubt playing over the relentless roar of the Atlantic.  The deadline for her next novel, a gothic thriller set in a crumbling Scottish manor house, loomed like a storm cloud on the horizon, and her manuscript, half-finished and abandoned on her desk, mocked her with its emptiness.  The wild, untamed beauty of the Cornish coastline, usually a muse, offered no solace this time.  Instead, it seemed to reflect the turbulent landscape of her own imagination, a place currently as barren and forbidding as the granite cliffs that plunged into the churning sea.
