The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorne, stinging his cheeks as he wrestled with the rusted latch on the gate.  Flakes of paint, the faded turquoise of a forgotten summer, chipped off and danced in the gusts. Beyond the gate, the rambling Victorian house loomed, a gothic silhouette against the bruised twilight sky.  Thornfield Manor, they called it, perched precariously on the windswept cliffs overlooking the churning grey expanse of the North Sea. Elias, bundled in his thickest work jacket, finally yanked the gate open with a groan of protesting metal. He was here to rewire the ancient electrical system, a job rumoured to be more trouble than it was worth. The locals whispered stories of Thornfield, of strange lights and flickering shadows, of a family curse and a history steeped in sorrow.  Elias, a practical man who dealt in watts and volts, not whispers and shadows, scoffed at such tales. Still, a shiver ran down his spine as the gate slammed shut behind him, the sound echoing unnaturally loud in the deepening gloom.
