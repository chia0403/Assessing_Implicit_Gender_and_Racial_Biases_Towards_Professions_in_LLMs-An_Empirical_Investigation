The salt spray kissed Amelia Hayesâ€™s face as she leaned against the railing of the ferry, the wind whipping her auburn braid against her wool coat.  The Isle of Skye rose from the churning sea like a slumbering giant, its peaks shrouded in mist and shadow.  Below the dramatic cliffs, the small harbor town of Portree huddled, a collection of brightly colored houses clinging to the rocky shore.  Amelia, a writer of gothic romances with a penchant for dramatic settings, couldn't have asked for a more perfect escape from the bustling, indifferent streets of London.  She'd come to Skye seeking inspiration for her next novel, a tale of a cursed family and their crumbling seaside manor.  The air itself hummed with an unsettling energy, a blend of breathtaking beauty and a sense of ancient secrets waiting to be unearthed. As the ferry docked, a shiver of anticipation, not entirely unpleasant, danced down Amelia's spine. This island, she felt instinctively, held a story within its heart, and she was here to listen.
