The insistent chime of the lobby door announced another arrival, pulling Elara Vivienne Holloway from the comforting rhythm of stapling invoices. Rain lashed against the Art Deco windows of the Wainwright Building, blurring the already fading Chicago skyline into a watercolour of greys and blues.  The lobby, usually buzzing with the comings and goings of lawyers and their clients, held a hushed stillness, punctuated only by the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock tucked in a corner. Elara, perched behind her polished mahogany desk, smoothed down her emerald green cardigan and plastered on her professional smile. It was 5:57 pm on a Friday, and she was three minutes away from escaping the gilded cage of Wainwright, Hastings & Carlyle, Attorneys at Law.
