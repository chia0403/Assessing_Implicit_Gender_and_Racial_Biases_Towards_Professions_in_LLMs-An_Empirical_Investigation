The biting November wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks that lined the drive, sending a flurry of dried leaves swirling around Elias Thorne's ankles. He tugged his tweed cap further down, the rough wool scratching against his forehead, and surveyed his domain. Wysteria Hall loomed large behind him, a gothic monstrosity of grey stone and leaded windows, its silhouette stark against the bruised twilight sky. Built in 1789, the manor house had seen better days. Ivy, thick as a man's arm, clawed at the crumbling mortar, and a pervasive dampness clung to the air like a shroud. Elias, however, found a peculiar comfort in the Hall's decay.  He’d been the groundskeeper here for twenty-two years, longer than any of the rotating cast of housekeepers and caretakers who flitted through the grand rooms like ghosts, and he knew every warped floorboard and leaky gutter as intimately as the lines on his own calloused hands. This sprawling estate, with its overgrown gardens and neglected orchard, was more his home than the small cottage tucked away at the edge of the property ever could be. And tonight, under the unsettling glow of a hunter’s moon, Elias felt a creeping unease disturb the usual quiet solitude he cherished. Something was different.
