The chipped paint of the "Melody Lounge" sign swayed precariously in the humid New Orleans night, groaning like a rusty swing set.  Rain, thick and warm, poured down Bourbon Street, slicking the cobblestones and scattering the usual throngs of tourists. Inside, the air hung heavy with the scent of stale beer, cheap perfume, and something vaguely floral that couldn't quite mask the underlying must. A single spotlight, tinged amber by years of cigarette smoke, illuminated the stage where Elara Josephine Moreau stood, clutching a vintage microphone stand like a lifeline. Her crimson dress, a hand-me-down from her grandmother, clung to her curves, shimmering under the dim light.  The Melody Lounge wasn't Carnegie Hall, not even close, but tonight, for Elara, it felt like the whole world.
