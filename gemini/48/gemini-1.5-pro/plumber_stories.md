The biting wind whipped around Elias Thorne's ankles as he wrestled the ancient cast iron pipe, its rusted joints screaming in protest.  Flakes of orange rust, disturbed by his efforts, drifted down like morbid confetti.  Above him, the December sky was the colour of a bruised plum, threatening snow over the ramshackle collection of Victorian terraced houses that clung to the steep hillside overlooking Port Blossom.  The salt air, usually a welcome balm, carried a sharp, icy edge that burrowed through Eliasâ€™s thick work jacket. This particular terrace, number 17 Grimshaw Lane, was notorious amongst Port Blossom's tradesmen. Its plumbing, a bewildering labyrinth of mismatched pipes and bodged repairs, was legendary for its capricious nature.  Elias suspected the original plumber had operated under the influence of absinthe and a profound misunderstanding of gravity.
