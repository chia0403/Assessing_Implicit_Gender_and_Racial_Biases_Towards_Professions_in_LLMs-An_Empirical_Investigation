The biting November wind whipped around Professor Alistair Finch, tugging at the edges of his tweed jacket as he hurried across the cobbled quadrangle of St. Jude's College, Oxford.  Gargoyles leered down from the honey-coloured stone walls, their expressions mirroring the grim set of Alistair's own face.  The low, grey sky threatened snow, and the gas lamps, already lit against the early dusk, flickered feebly, casting long, dancing shadows across the manicured lawns.

He clutched a worn leather-bound book tighter to his chest, the smooth, cool surface a small comfort against the creeping chill that seemed to emanate not from the weather, but from something deeper, something far more unsettling within the college itself.
