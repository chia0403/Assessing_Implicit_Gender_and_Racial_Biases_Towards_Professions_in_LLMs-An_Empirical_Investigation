The clatter of horse-drawn carriages against cobblestones and the cries of street vendors hawking their wares drifted up to the attic window of Elias Finch, Tailor and Clothier. Elias, a man whose wiry frame seemed perpetually draped in a fine layer of chalk dust, perched on his three-legged stool, squinting through the grime-streaked pane.  His shop, nestled between a boisterous public house and a perpetually silent apothecary, occupied a narrow, crooked building on Crowfoot Lane in the fog-choked city of New Birmingham.  The year was 1888, and the soot-stained sky above mirrored the perpetually grim mood of the city's working class.  A flickering gas lamp cast long, dancing shadows across his workbench, illuminating half-finished garments draped over dress forms like ghostly apparitions.  The air hung thick with the scent of beeswax, wool, and the faint, metallic tang of the pins Elias held delicately between his lips.  This morning, however, the usual rhythm of his work was punctuated by a persistent, unsettling feeling, a premonition of change hanging heavy in the air like the ever-present smog.
