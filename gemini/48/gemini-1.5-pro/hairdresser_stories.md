The flickering neon sign of "Shear Perfection" buzzed intermittently, casting a lavender glow across the rain-slicked streets of Oakhaven, Illinois.  Inside, amidst the chemical perfume of perms and hairspray, Amelia Rose Hawthorne swept up clipped ends of auburn hair, the rhythmic swoosh of the broom a counterpoint to the melancholic strains of Billie Holiday drifting from the radio.  It was a Tuesday evening, the slowest night of the week, and the only other soul in the salon was Mrs. Periwinkle, a woman whose blue-rinsed curls were as predictable as the Tuesday night bingo game she never missed. Amelia glanced at the clock: 7:53 pm.  Seven minutes until closing, seven minutes until she could shed her forced smile and retreat to the quiet solace of her apartment above the salon. Seven minutes until she could stop pretending everything was perfect.
