The flickering neon sign of "The Binary Bean" cast a lurid green glow across Amelia Grace Chen's tired face. Rain lashed against the cafe's panoramic window, blurring the already hazy Seattle skyline. Inside, the air hung thick with the aroma of burnt coffee and desperation. Amelia, hunched over her laptop in a secluded booth, ran a hand through her tangled black hair, a sigh escaping her lips. Lines of code scrolled across her screen, a cryptic language only she seemed to understand. It was 3:17 AM, the cafe was deserted save for a lone barista dozing behind the counter, and Amelia was chasing a ghost in the machine. A particularly nasty bug had been plaguing her latest project, a revolutionary AI program for medical diagnosis, and for the past 72 hours, it had stubbornly refused to be exorcised.  Seattle, shrouded in a perpetual drizzle, seemed to mirror her own internal weather â€“ grey, damp, and perpetually on the verge of a downpour.
