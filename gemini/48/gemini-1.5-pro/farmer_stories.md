The wind, sharp and smelling of approaching rain, whipped at Elias Thorne's weathered face as he surveyed his fields.  Rows of emerald winter wheat, barely knee-high, rippled like a restless sea under the grey October sky. Thornhill Farm, nestled in the shallow valley carved by the Whispering River in rural Vermont, had been in Elias's family for five generations.  The farmhouse, a sturdy structure of hand-hewn timber and fieldstone, stood sentinel against the rising slopes of the Green Mountains, its windows glowing warmly against the gathering gloom. Smoke curled invitingly from the chimney, hinting at the applewood fire crackling in the hearth and the pot of stew simmering on the stove, tended to by Elias's wife. But Elias felt none of the usual comfort the sight of home brought him.  This year, something felt different.  The air was heavy, not just with the promise of rain, but with an unsettling stillness, a hushed expectancy that prickled his skin and made the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end.
