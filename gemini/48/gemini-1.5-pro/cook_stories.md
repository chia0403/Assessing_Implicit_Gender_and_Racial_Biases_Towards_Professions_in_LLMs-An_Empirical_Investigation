The clatter of pans and the fragrant steam of simmering bouillabaisse filled the cramped galley kitchen of "The Salt Spray", a weathered fishing trawler currently bobbing its way through the choppy waters of the North Atlantic.  Amelia “Amy”  Fitzwilliam, head cook and sole culinary artist aboard, hummed a jaunty sea shanty as she deftly diced a carrot, the rhythmic thud of the knife against the worn wooden board a counterpoint to the creaking groans of the ship. Grey light filtered through the porthole, illuminating the cramped space crammed with pots, pans, and netting bags overflowing with potatoes and onions. Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune, a stark contrast to the warmth and savory smells emanating from Amy’s domain.  The fishing trip had been uneventful so far, with the catch disappointingly meager, but Amy was determined to keep spirits high with a hearty meal.  She knew that a full belly and a warm bowl of something savory could chase away even the deepest sea chill.
