The flickering fluorescent lights of the St. Jude's Hospital basement buzzed like trapped insects, their sickly glow reflecting off the slick, grey tiles.  The air hung heavy with the antiseptic tang of disinfectant and something fainter, something almost metallic, that tickled the back of Elias Finch's throat. He pushed his mop bucket across the floor, the squeaky wheels a counterpoint to the rhythmic drip of a leaky pipe somewhere in the labyrinthine network of pipes overhead. Elias, his name stitched in faded red letters onto the pocket of his dark blue uniform, sighed.  2:17 am. Another Tuesday morning, another symphony of silence and echoing emptiness in the bowels of St. Jude's.  Tonight, however, the silence felt different. Thicker. Charged.
