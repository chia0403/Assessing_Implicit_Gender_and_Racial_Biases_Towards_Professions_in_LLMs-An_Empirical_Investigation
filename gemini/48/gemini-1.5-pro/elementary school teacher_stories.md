The late afternoon sun, filtered through the dusty blinds of Mrs. Eleanor Vance’s fourth-grade classroom, cast long, striped shadows across the worn linoleum floor.  Room 4B, at Maplewood Elementary, smelled faintly of pencil shavings, Elmer’s glue, and the lingering ghost of lunchtime pizza. Outside, the shrieks of children on the playground drifted in through the open window, a stark contrast to the almost unsettling quiet within.  Eleanor, her auburn hair pulled back in a loose bun, perched on the edge of her desk, meticulously grading spelling tests.  A stack of brightly coloured construction paper butterflies, each bearing a student’s wobbly handwriting, fluttered precariously from a string strung across the bulletin board above her head. The air hung heavy with the anticipation of summer break, just two weeks away, but a knot of unease tightened in Eleanor’s stomach. Something felt… off.
