The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Milly" Hawthorne's braid across her face as she surveyed the skeletal remains of Mrs. Periwinkle's prize-winning rose bushes.  Frost crunched under her worn work boots, the sound strangely satisfying in the otherwise hushed garden.  Milly tucked the stray hairs behind her ear, the sharp scent of pine needles from the neighboring property mixing with the earthy aroma of damp soil.  Greystone Manor, a sprawling Victorian estate perched on the edge of the sleepy town of Hollow Creek, Massachusetts, looked particularly imposing under the steel-grey sky.  Its once vibrant gardens, now barren and brown, were Milly's current canvas, and winter was a formidable but familiar foe.  This year, however, something felt different. A shiver crawled down her spine, unrelated to the cold. It was as if the very air held its breath, waiting for something to happen.
