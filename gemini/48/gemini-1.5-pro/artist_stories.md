The salt-laced wind whipped Amelia Zephyr Thorne's auburn braid across her face as she perched precariously on the cliff edge. Below her, the turquoise waters of the Aegean Sea crashed against the volcanic rock of Santorini, sending plumes of white spray skyward.  Her canvas, secured to a battered easel by rusty clips, flapped in the wind like a wounded bird.  The whitewashed village of Oia, a cascade of cubic houses clinging to the cliff face, shimmered in the afternoon sun, its blue-domed churches punctuating the dazzling white like sapphires on fresh snow.  Amelia, ignoring the dizzying drop and the persistent wind that threatened to snatch her brushes away, dipped her brush into a vibrant cerulean and with a decisive stroke, began to capture the breathtaking, almost impossible, blue. This was the light she had been chasing for months, a light that existed nowhere else on Earth, a light she needed to translate onto canvas before it vanished with the setting sun.
