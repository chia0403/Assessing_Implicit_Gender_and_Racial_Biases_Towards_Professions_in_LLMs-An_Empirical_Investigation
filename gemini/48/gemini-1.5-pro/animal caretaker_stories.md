The biting wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's auburn braid across her face as she trudged through the ankle-deep snow towards the primate enclosure.  Dawn painted the sky in bruised purples and icy blues above the jagged peaks of the Teton Mountains, a backdrop to the sprawling Wild Ridge Animal Sanctuary.  The air, crisp and carrying the scent of pine and damp earth, vibrated with the anticipatory chattering of the sanctuary's residents. Amy, bundled in a thick parka and sturdy snow boots, exhaled a plume of white that momentarily obscured her view of the frosted enclosure fence. Today was a special day: the arrival of a rescued orangutan named Raja, and Amy, Wild Ridge's lead primate caretaker, felt a knot of nervous excitement tighten in her stomach.  The sanctuary, nestled in a secluded valley in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, was a haven for animals rescued from circuses, private owners, and poachers.  It was a place of second chances, and Amy was determined to give Raja the best one possible.
