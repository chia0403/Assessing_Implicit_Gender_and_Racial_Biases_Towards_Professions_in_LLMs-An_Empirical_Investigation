The fluorescent lights of the "Little Wonders Daycare" hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the chaotic symphony of giggling, babbling, and the occasional shriek.  Rain lashed against the large picture windows depicting cartoon farm animals, blurring the grey October sky beyond.  Inside, amidst the brightly coloured plastic furniture and scattered building blocks, Eleanor Vance, a twenty-two-year-old with perpetually tired eyes and a smile that could melt glaciers, navigated the turbulent sea of toddlers.  A rogue sippy cup of juice arced through the air, narrowly missing her head, and she sighed, already bracing herself for the inevitable sugar rush that would soon follow.  This particular Thursday was proving to be even more challenging than usual, and it was only 9:30 am.
