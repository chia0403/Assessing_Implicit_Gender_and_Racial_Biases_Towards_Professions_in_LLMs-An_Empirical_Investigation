The insistent California sun beat down on the frosted glass door of "Kneaded Relief," turning the cursive script into shimmering waves of heat. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of lavender and eucalyptus, a fragile truce against the desert dryness clinging to everything beyond the threshold.  Eleanor Vance, her fingers still tingling from the deep tissue work she’d just performed on a particularly knotted triathlete, sighed and glanced at the clock.  5:02 pm. Almost time to lock up and head home to the blessed quiet of her adobe casita, nestled amongst the cholla cacti and wind-sculpted rocks just outside Joshua Tree National Park.  But first, one last client.  A new one, according to the appointment book: Mr. Silas Blackwood. Eleanor hoped he wasn’t the type to request a “happy ending,” a scourge she battled with weary politeness and firm refusal. Joshua Tree attracted all sorts – the healers, the lost, the slightly unhinged, and occasionally, the outright creepy.  She adjusted the loose turquoise beads around her neck and plastered a professional smile on her face as the chime above the door announced Mr. Blackwood’s arrival.
