The air in the shack crackled with static, a familiar symphony to Elias Thorne.  Outside, the Alaskan wind howled like a banshee, rattling the corrugated iron walls of the remote weather station.  November had arrived in a flurry of snow and ice, clinging to the skeletal radio tower that stretched skyward like a frozen finger.  Elias, bundled in a thick wool sweater and a pair of worn-out fur-lined boots, adjusted the dials on the ancient Heathkit SB-102 transceiver, his brow furrowed in concentration.  He was alone, save for the blinking lights of the equipment and the ghostly whisper of distant voices filtering through the ether.  His nearest neighbor was a hundred miles south, a trapper named Old Man Hemlock, and even his infrequent radio calls felt like a lifeline in this desolate, frozen landscape.  Tonight, however, the static was worse than usual, a persistent roar that threatened to drown out everything else.  Something was interfering with the signal, and Elias had a gnawing feeling it wasn't just the weather.
