The flickering fluorescent lights of the Kress Building buzzed in counterpoint to the relentless drumming of rain against the grime-streaked windows.  Amelia Grace Hawthorne, a paralegal at the prestigious, yet soul-crushingly dull, law firm of  Whitaker, Vance & Sterling, sighed and rubbed her temples.  It was 7:17 pm on a Friday night in downtown Philadelphia, and the scent of stale coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air.  Outside, the city lights blurred into a hazy, Impressionist painting. Inside, Amelia was surrounded by towering stacks of discovery documents related to the seemingly endless Peterson vs. Peterson divorce case â€“ a war of attrition fought over antique spoons and a prized collection of porcelain thimbles.  She longed for the comforting warmth of her small apartment, the purring of her ginger cat, Clementine, and the promise of a good book.  But the senior partner, Mr. Whitaker himself, needed these documents summarized by Monday morning, and Mr. Whitaker, as everyone knew, was a stickler for deadlines.  He was also, as everyone also knew, utterly incapable of using the office copier without jamming it, hence Amelia's late-night vigil.
