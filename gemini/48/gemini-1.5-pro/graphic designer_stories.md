The insistent London drizzle seemed to reflect Elara Vivienne Holloway's mood. Grey, persistent, and slightly chilling.  She sat hunched over her laptop in the corner booth of "The Inkwell," a Shoreditch cafe that smelled perpetually of burnt coffee and printer ink â€“ a scent Elara, ironically, found comforting.  Her studio, "Holloway Designs," was just upstairs, a small but fiercely independent space crammed with Pantone swatches, half-finished mock-ups, and the gentle hum of her iMac.  But today, Elara needed the low buzz of the cafe and the anonymous company of strangers to try and wrestle with the brief that had been plaguing her for days:  rebranding a luxury dog food company.  "Posh Paws," the brief cheerfully proclaimed.  Elara sighed. Inspiration was proving as elusive as sunshine in November.
