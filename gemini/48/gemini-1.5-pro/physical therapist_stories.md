The biting November wind whipped around Eleanor Vance’s ankles as she hurried across the cobbled courtyard of Ashworth Manor, her breath clouding the frigid air.  Gargoyles perched on the eaves leered down at her, their stone faces slick with a mixture of rain and sleet.  Built in the late 1700s, the manor had been converted into a rehabilitation center thirty years ago, its imposing grandeur now softened by the warm glow emanating from its many mullioned windows.  Eleanor, head physical therapist at Ashworth, clutched her clipboard tighter, her fingers numb despite her gloves.  Inside, a demanding patient – the notoriously difficult Lord Beaumont – awaited his afternoon session, and Eleanor knew from experience that tardiness was not a luxury she could afford. The heavy oak door creaked open, revealing the dimly lit reception area, its vastness only emphasized by the flickering fire in the enormous hearth.  The scent of woodsmoke and antiseptic hung heavy in the air, a peculiar but familiar aroma that Eleanor had come to associate with healing and resilience.
