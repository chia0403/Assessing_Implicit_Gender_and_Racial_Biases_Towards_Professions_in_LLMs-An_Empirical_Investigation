The biting wind whipped snow against the frosted windows of Dr. Amelia Reyes' veterinary clinic, the howl a mournful counterpoint to the gentle purring of a ginger tabby curled on her examination table. The clinic, nestled in the heart of Jasper Valley, a remote mountain town in Colorado, usually exuded warmth â€“ the scent of hay and antiseptic a comforting blend. But tonight, with the blizzard raging outside and the temperature plummeting, even the crackling fireplace in the corner struggled to chase away the encroaching chill. Amelia, her dark hair pulled back in a practical braid, adjusted the stethoscope against the tabby's chest, a frown creasing her brow.  Jasper Valley was a haven for her, a place where she could practice veterinary medicine with a focus on the animals she loved, far from the pressures of city life. But tonight, the isolation felt less like peace and more like a precarious perch on the edge of the world.
