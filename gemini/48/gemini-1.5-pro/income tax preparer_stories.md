The stale air in Amelia Grace Holloway's office tasted faintly of desperation and instant coffee.  Outside, the relentless Arizona sun beat down on the dusty strip mall in Mesa, baking the asphalt until it shimmered. Inside, beneath the flickering fluorescent lights of Holloway & Associates (Associates being Amelia and a temperamental printer named Betsy), the air conditioner wheezed a pathetic imitation of a cool breeze.

The only client she'd seen all day was Mrs. Henderson, a sweet but senile woman convinced she was owed a refund for taxes paid during the McKinley administration.  Amelia, chin resting on her hand, stared out at the shimmering heat and wondered if she could claim existential ennui as a business expense.
