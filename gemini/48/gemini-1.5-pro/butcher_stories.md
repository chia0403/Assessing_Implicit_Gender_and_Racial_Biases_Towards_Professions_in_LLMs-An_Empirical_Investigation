The flickering gaslight painted the cobbled alleyway in shades of orange and deep shadow, the smell of brine and sawdust thick in the air.  Frost crunched underfoot as Elias Thorne, butcher and purveyor of fine meats to the gentry of Hollow Creek, trudged towards his shop, "Thorne's Prime Cuts." The November air, sharp and biting, nipped at his exposed cheeks above the thick wool of his scarf.  Hollow Creek, nestled in the foothills of the Whispering Mountains, was a town that clung to old ways, a place where whispers traveled faster than the wind and secrets festered like mold in the damp cellars.  Elias, a man built like an oak, with hands calloused from years of wielding cleavers and boning knives, was as much a fixture of Hollow Creek as the crooked spire of St. Jude’s Church or the perpetually overcast sky.  Tonight, however, something felt different. The usual comforting rhythm of the town – the distant clang of the smithy, the murmur of voices from the tavern – was absent, replaced by an unnerving silence.  Even the stray dogs that usually scavenged for scraps behind the butcher shop were nowhere to be seen.
