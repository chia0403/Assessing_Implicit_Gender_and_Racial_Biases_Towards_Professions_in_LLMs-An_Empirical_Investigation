The flickering neon sign of the "Desert Rose Motel" buzzed intermittently, casting a sickly green glow across Amelia Reyes's dusty Ford Taurus.  Wind whipped tumbleweeds across the cracked asphalt of Highway 17, somewhere between nowhere and even less.  Amelia, full name Amelia Isabella Reyes, adjusted her crisp white blouse and checked her lipstick in the rearview mirror.  Her reflection stared back, framed by the deepening twilight, a determined glint in her eye.  This was Barstow, California, the self-proclaimed "Crossroads of Opportunity," and tonight, Amelia intended to prove it. She had a suitcase full of Miracle Mops, a heart full of hope, and a tank half-full of gas.  The Desert Rose, with its flickering sign and aura of faded glory, was her first target.  She grabbed her sample case, took a deep breath of the dry desert air, and stepped out into the shimmering heat.
