Her pencil danced across the vellum, precise and swift, bringing to life the intricate details of a proposed luxury condominium complex slated for the Gold Coast.  The faint scent of ammonia from the blueprint machine mingled with the bitter aroma of lukewarm coffee, creating a peculiar perfume that hung heavy in the air. It was 5:47 AM, and Amelia, the first drafter to arrive and often the last to leave, was already lost in a world of lines, angles, and dimensions, a world where everything had its place and purpose, unlike the chaotic sprawl of her own life.
