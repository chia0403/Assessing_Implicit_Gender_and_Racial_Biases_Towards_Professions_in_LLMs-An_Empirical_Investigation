The wind, sharp and smelling of impending snow, whipped across the Wyoming plains, biting at the exposed skin of Elias Vance Holloway.  His chapped lips, cracked from the dry air, tightened into a thin line as he surveyed the endless expanse of the Diamondback Ranch. The setting sun painted the rolling hills in hues of bruised purple and faded gold, a stark contrast to the steel-grey clouds gathering ominously in the west.  Barbed wire fences, strung tight as violin strings, stretched across the landscape, marking the boundaries of Elias's domain â€“ five thousand acres of unforgiving beauty that had been in his family for four generations.  The ranch house, a sturdy structure of weathered wood and stone, hunkered down against the wind, a single light flickering warmly in a kitchen window, a beacon in the gathering dusk.  Winter was coming, and with it, a new set of challenges for Elias and the Diamondback.
