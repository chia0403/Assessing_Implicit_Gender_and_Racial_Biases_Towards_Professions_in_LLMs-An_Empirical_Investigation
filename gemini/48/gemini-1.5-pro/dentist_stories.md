The chipped porcelain flamingo, one of a flock lining Dr. Elias Thorne's windowsill, vibrated with the low rumble of the Chicago 'L' train passing two stories below.  Rain lashed against the grime-streaked glass, mirroring the streaks of anxiety tightening Dr. Thorne's jaw.  His office, nestled above a laundromat in the heart of Lincoln Park, usually hummed with the gentle whir of the drill and the murmur of NPR.  Today, however, a thick, unsettling silence clung to the air, punctuated only by the rhythmic tick-tock of the oversized clock in the waiting room – a clock that seemed to be counting down to something Elias couldn’t quite put his finger on.  It was a Tuesday, typically his busiest day, yet his appointment book remained stubbornly blank.  Not a single patient. Not even Mrs. Petrov, who usually scheduled a cleaning every three weeks, rain or shine, complaining about her dentures.
