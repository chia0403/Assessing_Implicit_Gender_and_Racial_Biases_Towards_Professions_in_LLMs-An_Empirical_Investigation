The tar hissed and bubbled under the July sun, releasing a pungent, almost sweet, aroma that clung to Elias Thorne like a second skin. He knelt on the scalding shingles of Mrs. Abernathy's Victorian, the slate-grey roof sloping precariously down towards the manicured lawns of Willow Creek.  Below him, the small Ohio town shimmered in the heat haze, a patchwork of green lawns, red brick, and the sparkling ribbon of the Little Miami River winding through it all.  Elias adjusted his sweat-soaked bandana and squinted at the storm damage, a ragged tear in the felt underlayment that explained the leak plaguing the widowâ€™s attic.  A cicada buzzed insistently from a nearby oak, its drone a constant soundtrack to the sweltering afternoon.  This was Elias's life: patching up holes, one shingle at a time, against the relentless backdrop of a Midwestern summer.
