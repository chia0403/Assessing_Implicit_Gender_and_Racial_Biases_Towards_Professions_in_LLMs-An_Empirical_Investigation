The scent of aging paper and lemon polish hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma Eleanor Vance had come to associate with sanctuary.  Eleanor, head librarian of the Whispering Pines Public Library, tucked a stray strand of her auburn hair behind her ear and surveyed her domain.

Outside, the sleepy town of Whispering Pines, nestled deep within the redwood forests of Northern California, was slowly waking.  The only sounds that penetrated the library's thick walls were the distant chirp of a robin and the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner, a constant reminder of the slow, deliberate passage of time within these hallowed halls.  But this morning, something felt different.  A faint, unsettling energy thrummed beneath the usual quiet hum of the library, a premonition that the predictable rhythm of Eleanor's life was about to be irrevocably disrupted.
