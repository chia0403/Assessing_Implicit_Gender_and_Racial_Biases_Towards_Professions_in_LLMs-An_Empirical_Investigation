The pungent aroma of perm solution mingled with the sweet scent of hairspray, creating a unique perfume that clung to everything inside "Curl Up & Dye,"  a small salon nestled between a laundromat and a pawn shop in the perpetually sun-drenched town of Harmony Springs, Arizona.

Today, however, the quiet was more unsettling than usual. A feeling of anticipation, thick and heavy like the humidity before a desert storm, hung in the air.
