The biting November wind rattled the leaded panes of Genevieve "Gen" Dubois's atelier, whistling a mournful tune through the gaps.  Her small shop, nestled between a bustling fishmonger and a perpetually gloomy undertaker on Rue de l'Aiguille in Parisian Montmartre, was usually filled with the rustle of silks, the snip of shears, and the murmur of Madame Dubois's humming. Today, however, an unusual silence hung heavy in the air, broken only by the rhythmic tap-tap-tapping of rain against the window.  Grey light filtered through the frosted glass, illuminating bolts of vibrant fabrics stacked haphazardly against the walls – ruby velvet, emerald satin, sapphire silk – a riot of colour against the dreary backdrop of the cobbled street outside. A half-finished gown of ivory lace, destined for a Countess's winter ball, lay draped over a dressmaker's dummy, its delicate beading shimmering like captured starlight. Gen herself, a woman of sharp angles and even sharper wit, stood staring out at the rain, a frown etched deep into her normally expressive face.  Her dark hair, usually pulled back in a severe bun, had loosened, framing a face that, despite its current seriousness, hinted at a hidden warmth. Something was amiss, and Gen, with her needle-sharp intuition, could feel it pricking at her like a stray pin.
