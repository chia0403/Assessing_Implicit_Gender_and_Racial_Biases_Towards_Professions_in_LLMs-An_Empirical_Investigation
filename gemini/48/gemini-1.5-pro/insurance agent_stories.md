The stale, recirculated air of the Zenith Insurance office hummed a monotonous tune around Beatrice "Bea" Agatha Finch.  Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, reflecting off the sterile white walls and Bea's meticulously organized desk.  It was a Tuesday in August in Harmony Springs, Ohio, a town so idyllically named it felt almost satirical.  Outside, the humidity hung thick and heavy, the air shimmering with the promise of an afternoon thunderstorm. Inside, however, the atmosphere was one of unchanging, predictable monotony. Bea tapped a perfectly manicured nail against her keyboard, staring at a spreadsheet detailing the actuarial tables for tractor insurance.  Harmony Springs wasn't exactly a hub of agricultural activity, but Zenith insured everything from combine harvesters to prize-winning pumpkins, and Bea, as the town's sole insurance agent, dealt with it all.  This Tuesday, however, promised to be different.  A sleek, black car, the kind that rarely graced Harmony Springs' sleepy streets, pulled up outside the office, its tinted windows reflecting the distorted image of the Zenith Insurance sign.  Bea watched as a tall, imposing figure emerged, clutching a briefcase.  A shiver of unease, as unexpected as the car itself, ran down her spine.  This wasn't a claim for a dented fender or a hail-damaged roof.  This was something else entirely.
