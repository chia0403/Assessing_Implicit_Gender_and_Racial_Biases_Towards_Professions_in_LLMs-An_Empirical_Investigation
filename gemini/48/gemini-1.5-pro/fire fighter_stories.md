The biting November wind whipped around Captain Elias “Eli” Thorne as he stood on the rooftop of the four-story brick apartment building, the acrid smell of smoke clinging to his turnout gear.  Auburn, New York, usually bathed in the warm hues of autumn foliage this time of year, was tonight a canvas of flickering orange and malevolent grey. Flames licked at the dark sky from the broken windows of the top floor, illuminating the panicked faces of residents huddled on the street below, clutching blankets against the cold.  Sirens wailed in the distance, a mournful counterpoint to the crackling inferno that threatened to consume the century-old structure. Eli’s yellow helmet reflected the chaotic scene, a grim reminder of the battle he and his crew were about to face.  He adjusted his mask, the hiss of his breathing apparatus a small island of calm in the growing storm.
