Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Amelia "Amy" Reyes's Ford Focus, mirroring the turmoil churning inside her. The flickering neon sign of the "Lucky Dragon" takeout cast an oily sheen across the slick asphalt of the parking lot.  Chinatown, nestled between the gleaming skyscrapers of downtown San Francisco and the shadowy warehouses of the docks, usually hummed with a vibrant energy, even at this late hour. Tonight, however, a thick, oppressive silence hung in the air, punctuated only by the rhythmic drumming of the rain and the distant wail of a siren. Amy checked her watch â€“ 11:47 pm.  She was late, again, for her meeting with Jason "Jinx" Lee, a small-time grifter with a penchant for bad decisions and an even worse poker face.  Jinx was one of Amy's toughest cases, a slippery fish always teetering on the edge of violating his probation. And tonight, Amy had a gut feeling that Jinx was about to take a big, messy plunge.
