The relentless wail of the siren sliced through the oppressive humidity of the New Orleans night.  Rain, fat and insistent, lashed against the windshield of Medic One, blurring the already hazy neon glow of Bourbon Street.

The radio crackled, a dispatcher's voice tight with urgency: "Medic One, we have a possible OD at the corner of St. Peter and Royal. Multiple victims, unresponsive."  Evie slammed her foot on the gas, the ambulance surging forward, its flashing lights painting the slick streets in alternating strokes of red and white.  The French Quarter, usually alive with music and laughter, held its breath, waiting.
