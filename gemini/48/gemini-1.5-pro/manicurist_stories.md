The air in "Nailed It," Amelia Rose Hawthorne's salon, hung thick with the scent of acetone and something vaguely floral – Amelia's attempt to mask the chemical tang with a diffuser she'd bought impulsively on Instagram. Rain lashed against the large plate-glass window, blurring the view of bustling Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village, New York. It was a Tuesday afternoon, usually a slow period, but today, the salon was unusually busy.  A cacophony of chatter, the whir of nail drills, and the rhythmic snip of Amelia’s cuticle nippers filled the compact space. Amelia herself, a whirlwind of vibrant turquoise hair and precisely painted crimson nails, darted between clients, her smile as bright and polished as the gel she applied.  A brass bell above the door chimed, announcing another arrival, and Amelia's smile tightened just a fraction.  She knew that chime.  It belonged to Mrs. Vandergelt, a woman whose demands were as sharp and meticulously shaped as her stiletto nails.
