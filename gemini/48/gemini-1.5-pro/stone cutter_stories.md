The wind, sharp and smelling of brine, whipped Elias Thorne's thick, grey hair across his weathered face.  He squinted, the late afternoon sun reflecting off the churning slate-grey sea that gnawed at the cliffs below his workshop. The workshop, little more than a sturdy wooden lean-to built against the rock face, clung precariously to the edge of the Dorset coastline near Lulworth Cove. Inside, amidst the dust and the metallic tang of chisel on stone, Elias carved intricate patterns into a block of Portland limestone, the rhythmic clang echoing across the desolate, windswept landscape.  He hummed a mournful sea shanty, a tune as old and worn as the cliffs themselves, oblivious to the approaching storm brewing on the horizon.
