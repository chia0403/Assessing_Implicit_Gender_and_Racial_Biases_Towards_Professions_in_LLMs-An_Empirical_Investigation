Fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting long, skeletal shadows across the greasy concrete floor of "Rosie's Rods and Repairs."  This wasn't some fancy, chrome-plated establishment; it was a haven for battered pickups, sputtering sedans, and the occasional muscle car gasping its last breath.  Elizabeth "Ellie" Ramirez, her hands smudged with grime and her dark hair pulled back in a messy bun, sighed, rubbing the ache in her lower back.  It was barely 7 am, the sun just beginning to peek over the jagged peaks of the San Gabriel Mountains, painting the dusty windows of the garage a fiery orange, and already Ellieâ€™s day felt like it was in overdrive.  A beat-up Ford F-150 sat on the lift, its engine disemboweled, a testament to a weekend warrior's ill-advised tinkering.  This was Ellie's life, a symphony of busted carburetors, stripped bolts, and the satisfying roar of a finely tuned engine. But today, the quiet hum of the morning held a different kind of tension, a premonition that this Monday would be anything but ordinary.
