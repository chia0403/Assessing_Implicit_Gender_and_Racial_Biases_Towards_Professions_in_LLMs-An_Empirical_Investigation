The neon green "EAT" sign of the Desert Rose Diner buzzed erratically, casting a sickly glow over the cracked asphalt of the parking lot.  Dust devils danced across the desolate landscape, swirling red dirt against the bruised purple of the approaching twilight.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and frying onions.  This was Harmony Springs, Nevada, population 384 (not counting the tumbleweeds), and for Clara Mae Johnson, it was just another pitstop on a long haul from Bakersfield to Reno.  Clara, her knuckles white against the worn leather of her Peterbilt's steering wheel, eased the eighteen-wheeler into a space beside a rusting Ford pickup, the engine groaning a protest after twelve hours on the road. The desert wind, hot and dry, whipped at her braided hair as she climbed down from the cab, the setting sun painting the sky in fiery hues of orange and red.  She stretched her aching back, a sigh escaping her lips, and headed towards the diner, the promise of a hot meal and a strong cup of coffee a beacon in the deepening desert night.
