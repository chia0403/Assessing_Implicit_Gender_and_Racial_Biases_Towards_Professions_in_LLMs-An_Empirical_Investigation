The pre-dawn chill clung to Elias Vance like the fine dust coating his already worn Carhartt jacket.  He stamped his steel-toed boots against the cracked asphalt of the parking lot, a futile attempt to chase away the numbness creeping into his toes. The sky above the skeletal frame of the "Skyreach Tower" – Denver's soon-to-be tallest skyscraper – was a bruised purple, slowly bleeding into the pale orange of a hesitant sunrise.  Around him, the lot was a symphony of rumbling engines and the clang of metal as other crew members arrived, their pickups and vans spitting gravel and exhaust fumes into the crisp air. Elias grabbed his hardhat from the dash of his beat-up Ford Ranger, its faded blue paint a testament to years of hard work and sun exposure.  He inhaled deeply, the familiar scent of sawdust, diesel, and welding fumes strangely comforting, and braced himself for another day hundreds of feet above the city.  He wasn't afraid of heights, not exactly, but the gnawing awareness of gravity's constant pull never truly left him.
