The biting wind whipped across the desolate stretch of I-90, whistling a lonely tune through the skeletal branches of the ponderosa pines clinging to the rocky hillside. Flakes of snow, fat and lazy, began to drift down, dusting the asphalt with a premature coat of winter.  Elias Vance, bundled in a fluorescent orange parka two sizes too big, stamped his steel-toed boots against the cold, the rhythmic clang echoing across the empty highway.  A string of orange cones, battered and faded from years of sun and abuse, stretched out behind him, marking off the closed lane where a gaping pothole, deep enough to swallow a small dog whole, awaited repair.  The digital clock on the dash of Elias's battered Ford F-150, parked precariously close to the edge of the drop-off, blinked 5:47 AM.  Dawn was still a distant promise, hidden behind the heavy curtain of snow clouds that blanketed the Montana sky.  He was alone, as always, the only sign of life for miles on this desolate stretch of road between Billings and nowhere.
