Rain lashed against the attic windowpane, mimicking the staccato rhythm of Elias Thorne's frantic typing. Outside, the cobbled streets of Prague shimmered under the sodium glow of streetlights, the light fractured and distorted by the downpour. Inside, nestled amongst stacks of manuscripts, dusty tomes, and the faint scent of mildew, Elias, his spectacles perched precariously on his nose, battled a deadline. His small, book-lined attic room, tucked away in the less fashionable district of Žižkov, served as both his sanctuary and his prison. It was 1938, a year heavy with the whispers of war, and Elias, a man more comfortable with the company of fictional characters than real ones, found himself increasingly isolated, his only connection to the outside world the manuscripts that landed on his worn oak desk. Tonight, it was a particularly challenging piece – a rambling, semi-coherent spy thriller set in the shadowy corners of pre-war Berlin, its plot as tangled as the ivy creeping up the building outside.
