The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the Busy Bee Diner, a rhythm Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez knew by heart. It was a Tuesday night in October, the kind of night that brought out the regulars and chased away the tourists in coastal Port Blossom, Oregon.  Amy, her name tag slightly askew on her powder-blue uniform, navigated the narrow aisles between booths, balancing a tray laden with coffee refills, a slice of apple pie, and a hefty plate of chicken-fried steak. The air inside the diner hung thick with the mingled scents of frying onions, stale coffee, and Mrs. Higgins' lilac perfume â€“ a familiar, almost comforting blend.  Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a pale glow on the worn linoleum floor and the faded photographs of local fishermen and their prize catches that adorned the walls. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, rattling the windows and making the "OPEN" sign swing precariously. It was the kind of night that promised secrets whispered in hushed tones over steaming mugs and weary confessions shared with the only sympathetic ear in town: Amy's.
