Rain lashed against the window of "Wanderlust Voyages," blurring the neon pink flamingo in the logo.  Inside, Amelia Iris Thorne, her auburn hair piled atop her head in a precarious bun, tapped a manicured nail against her mahogany desk. The rhythmic click echoed in the otherwise silent office.

But tonight, the only sounds were the relentless downpour and Amelia's restless tapping. The scent of jasmine tea, long gone cold in a chipped porcelain mug, mingled with the damp wool of forgotten coats left by clients earlier that day.
