The opulent Grand Majestic Hotel, a monolith of marble and gilded iron, pulsed with a low hum of hushed conversations and the clinking of crystal.  Rain lashed against the tall arched windows, mirroring the nervous flutter in Elias Finch's stomach. Elias, all of nineteen years old and dressed in a crisp, though slightly too-large, navy uniform, stood nervously by the grand entrance, the polished brass bell cart reflecting the swirling anxieties in his brown eyes.  It was the eve of the Vandergelt Diamond Gala, an event so prestigious it made even seasoned staff members tremble, and for Elias, a newly promoted bell hop barely three weeks into the job, it felt like standing on the precipice of a glittering, terrifying abyss. The lobby, usually buzzing with activity, held an anticipatory stillness, thick with the scent of lilies and the unspoken promise of extravagant drama.  Every surface gleamed, from the vast chandelier dripping with crystals to the highly polished mahogany floors, reflecting the city lights back into the opulent space.  Outside, the storm raged on, mirroring the tempest brewing within Elias.  He had a feeling this night was going to be one he'd never forget.
