The bell above the door of "Apothecary & Anodyne," a quaint, brick-fronted pharmacy nestled between a dusty bookstore and a perpetually bustling laundromat, chimed a melancholic two-note tune. Rain, the kind that promised to linger all day, lashed against the large bay window, obscuring the view of the usually vibrant Sycamore Street in the small town of Alderâ€™s Bend, Oregon.  Inside, Eleanor Ainsworth, Pharm.D., adjusted the collar of her crisp white coat, a faint scent of lavender and star anise clinging to the fabric. The only other occupant of the shop was Mrs. Henderson's ginger cat, Marmalade, who sat perched atop a stack of outdated medical journals, regarding Eleanor with a perpetually disapproving glare.  The digital clock on the wall blinked 7:58 AM. Two minutes until another Tuesday began, and Eleanor had a feeling this one would be anything but ordinary.
