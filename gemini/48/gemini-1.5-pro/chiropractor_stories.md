The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, rattling the "Walk-Ins Welcome" sign hanging precariously from the brick facade of Dr. Elias Thorne's chiropractic clinic.  Inside, a single, flickering fluorescent bulb buzzed over the worn, hunter-green reception area, casting long, skeletal shadows across the empty waiting room chairs. Elias Thorne, D.C., rubbed his hands together, trying to chase away the chill that had seeped into his bones despite the crackling radiator in the corner. November in Chicago had a way of doing that, sinking its icy teeth deep and refusing to let go.  The clinic, nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed Polish bakery on Milwaukee Avenue, usually bustled with aching backs and stiff necks, but tonight, an hour past closing, the only sound was the mournful howl of the wind and the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock inherited from his grandmother.  Elias was about to lock up and head home to his equally chilly apartment when a sharp rap echoed against the glass of the front door.
