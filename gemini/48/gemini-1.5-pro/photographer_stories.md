The salt spray kissed Eleanor Vance's face, a familiar sting that mirrored the knot in her stomach.  The Isle of Skye, usually a painter’s paradise with its dramatic cliffs plunging into the turquoise sea, felt oppressive this morning.  Low-slung clouds, the colour of bruised plums, clung to the peaks of the Cuillin range, swallowing the usual golden light. Eleanor shivered, pulling her thick wool scarf tighter around her neck.  Her camera bag, heavy with lenses and the weight of expectation, dug into her shoulder.  This was it.  The location scout had sworn the abandoned croft at Rubha Hunish, perched precariously on the northernmost tip of the island, was exactly what she’d been searching for: desolate, windswept, and steeped in the kind of melancholic beauty that resonated with her current project, “Ghosts of the Highlands.” But as the wind howled around her, whipping her dark hair across her face, Eleanor wondered if she'd bitten off more than she could chew.  The croft, a crumbling stone shell barely clinging to the cliff edge, looked more like the gateway to the underworld than a source of inspiration.
