The humid Miami air hung heavy, even at 6:00 AM.  Dew clung to the vibrant bougainvillea cascading over the wrought-iron fence of the exclusive Biscayne Bay Beach Club.

Fifty brightly-clad figures, a mix of tanned socialites and determined early risers, unfurled their yoga mats, the synthetic rubber squeaking against the polished coral stone floor. Lexi, her dark ponytail bouncing with each movement, surveyed her class.  A faint scent of sea salt mingled with the coconut oil and expensive sunscreen, a familiar aroma that marked the beginning of another day in her perfectly sculpted, perfectly controlled world.  This morning, however, a flicker of unease danced behind Lexi’s meticulously applied smile.  Something felt…off.
