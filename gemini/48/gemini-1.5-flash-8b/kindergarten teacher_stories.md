The chipped paint of the "Sunshine Smiles" kindergarten classroom, a cheerful yellow that had long since faded to a sickly ochre, reflected the afternoon sun.  Dust motes danced in the last rays, illuminating a flurry of colourful drawings â€“ a dragon with seven heads, a majestic unicorn adorned with glitter glue, and a meticulously crafted portrait of Ms.  Anya Petrova, the kindergarten teacher, complete with oversized glasses and a slightly too-perky smile.  It was a typical Tuesday, a Tuesday that was about to become anything but.

Ms. Anya Petrova, a woman whose auburn hair perpetually defied gravity, settled into her worn armchair.  A gentle sigh escaped her lips, her eyes tracing the chaotic beauty of the room.  This year, her 2-2's (the two-year-olds) had blossomed into curious little explorers, their tiny hands eager to grasp, their voices filling the space with a cacophony of babbles and pronouncements. Yet, today, a quiet unease settled over the classroom, heavier than the afternoon dust.  A single, crimson-red rose, inexplicably placed on her desk, seemed to amplify the tension.  It was a gift, one marked with an anonymous note; the paper uncharacteristically rough and scratchy under her touch.  The message simply read, "Careful, Anya."
