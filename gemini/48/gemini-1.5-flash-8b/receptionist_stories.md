The chipped Formica countertop of Reception Desk 3 hummed with a low, almost imperceptible vibration.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun, filtering through the grimy windowpanes of the dilapidated office building, casting long shadows across the worn floral carpet.  Rain slicked the pavement outside, mirroring the perpetual sheen on the polished surfaces of the numerous, similarly outdated reception desks that lined the hall.  This particular desk, and its occupant,  Anya Petrova, felt decidedly less vibrant.

Anya, a petite woman with a perpetually tired expression and hair the color of a faded dandelion, stared blankly at the blinking cursor on her ancient computer. The air in the small, windowless room smelled faintly of stale coffee and desperation.  Her phone sat silently, a small, metallic monument to unanswered calls and unfulfilled requests. The fluorescent lights buzzed, a monotonous counterpoint to the rhythmic drip of the leaky faucet in the men's restroom down the hall.  Today was another Tuesday, another day lost in the bureaucratic labyrinth of paperwork and promises.  The only thing certain was the relentless hum of the building's archaic cooling system.
