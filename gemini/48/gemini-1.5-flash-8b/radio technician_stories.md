The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Microphone" cast a sickly yellow glow across the rain-slicked alley.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of solder and stale coffee.  Elias Thorne, radio technician extraordinaire, or "Sparky" as he preferred, hunched over a tangle of wires, his brow furrowed in concentration.  A symphony of static, crackles, and distant sirens filled the cramped workshop.  This was Elias's sanctuary, his battlefield, the only place where the world outside could be silenced, at least for a while.

The setting was the gritty, post-industrial heart of Newhaven, a city choked by smog and shadowed by towering, skeletal factory buildings.  Towering apartment blocks, their paint peeling and their windows like vacant eyes, surrounded the dilapidated workshops and warehouses like watchful, indifferent giants.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a constant, rhythmic drumming that seemed to mirror the insistent hum of Elias's thoughts.  Elias wasn't just a radio technician; he was a keeper of forgotten frequencies, a decipherer of whispered signals from the past.  Tonight, something was different.  Tonight, a signal he couldn't quite place had tugged at the edges of his conscious mind, a ghostly echo from a distant, forgotten broadcast.
