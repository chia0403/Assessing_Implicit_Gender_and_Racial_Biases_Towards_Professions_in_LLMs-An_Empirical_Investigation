The greasy, metallic tang hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Bartholomew "Barty"  Fitzwilliam, Jr., as he wrestled with a stubborn engine block.  Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a harsh glare on the jumbled landscape of tools, parts, and half-dismantled vehicles that filled the cramped garage.  Barty's grease-stained fingers, calloused and strong, were covered in a film of grime that had seeped into the very fabric of his life.  Outside, the relentless summer sun beat down on the grimy, cracked asphalt of the back alley where "Fitzwilliam's Fix-It Shop" resided, a forgotten haven of hammered metal and whirring motors nestled between a dilapidated clothing store and a row of dilapidated apartment buildings.  The rhythmic clang of a hammer against metal punctuated the ambient hum of the engine, a soundtrack to Barty's solitary work routine. Today, however, a different kind of noise was intruding â€“ a soft, insistent tapping emanating from the passenger side of a battered, rust-eaten Ford Falcon parked beside his workbench.
