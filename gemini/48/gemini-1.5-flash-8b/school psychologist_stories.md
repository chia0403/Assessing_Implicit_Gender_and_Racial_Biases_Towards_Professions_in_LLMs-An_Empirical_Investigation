The grey, overcast sky mirrored the muted despair that clung to the students like a second skin.  Today, it felt particularly oppressive.  Dr. Vance, her trench coat soaked through,  pulled the worn collar higher, her gaze scanning the empty hallways.  A sudden, sharp cry from the courtyard snapped her attention. A flash of scarlet against the dreary grey backdrop caught her eye.
