The flickering fluorescent lights of "Serenity Springs Massage," casting long, distorted shadows across the worn, floral-patterned carpet, barely illuminated the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Amelia Blackwood's heart.  Her hands, normally adept at coaxing tension from knotted muscles, trembled slightly as she traced the outline of the intricate henna tattoo swirling on her client's back.  The aroma of sandalwood and lavender hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the growing unease churning within her.

Tonight, nestled within the quiet suburban cul-de-sac where Serenity Springs was tucked, something felt...off.  The usually chatty neighbours were unusually silent, the birds were oddly hushed, and the faint, almost imperceptible, hum of the town's life felt muffled, like a trapped animal breathing shallowly.  The softly playing jazz music from the speakers seemed to amplify the oppressive stillness.  Amelia knew these subtle shifts, these phantom whispers of the uncanny.  She'd felt them before, always preceding a shift in the energy, a significant event, sometimes good, sometimes bad.  And tonight, the premonition was chilling.
