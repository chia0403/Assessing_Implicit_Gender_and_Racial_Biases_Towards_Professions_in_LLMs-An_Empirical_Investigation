The scent of burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the usual floral and citrusy perfumes that usually permeated Amelia Blackwood's salon, "The Gilded Shear."  This wasn't a bad smell, not exactly.  It was the kind of aroma that clung to the edges of memories, a lingering whisper of something sweet and faintly scorched.  Amelia, a petite woman with eyes the colour of polished mahogany, traced the line of a meticulously sculpted bob with the delicate tip of her scissors.  Her client, a woman named Eleanor Vance, sat rigidly, her expression a mask of serene boredom.  The salon, a small, sun-drenched space tucked away on a quiet cobbled street in the heart of the burgeoning artisan district of  Ashworth, was usually buzzing with conversation and the rhythmic snip-snip of scissors.  But today, the silence was almost palpable, punctuated only by the soft click-clack of Amelia's shoes against the polished floorboards and the low hum of the vintage hair dryer.  A sense of unease, like a heavy blanket, lay draped over the room, weighing down the usually vibrant atmosphere.
