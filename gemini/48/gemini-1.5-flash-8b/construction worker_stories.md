The biting wind whipped at Amelia "Milly" Rodriguez's hardhat, stinging her cheeks and rattling the precariously balanced scaffolding boards beneath her feet.  Fifty stories up, the city of Veridian sprawled out below like a meticulously crafted miniature, a kaleidoscope of shimmering glass and steel.  Below her, the rhythmic clang of construction equipment echoed, a persistent tattoo against the muted roar of the wind.  Milly, her hands calloused and stained with the inevitable grime of her profession, adjusted her safety harness, the familiar weight a comforting counterpoint to the dizzying heights.

Veridian, a sprawling metropolis built on the remnants of a forgotten geothermal field, boasted a skyline that defied gravity. Towering skyscrapers, clad in shimmering, iridescent panels that pulsed with captured geothermal energy, pierced the perpetual twilight sky, creating a fantastical and intimidating panorama.  The air, thick with the scent of ozone and newly poured concrete, hung heavy with the ghosts of past projects, past failures, and the whispered promises of tomorrow's triumphs.  Milly had witnessed the city's growth from its humble, early stages, the concrete jungle taking shape brick by painful brick, under the watchful, if indifferent, eye of the sky.
