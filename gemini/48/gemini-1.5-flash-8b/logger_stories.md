The biting wind, a skeletal hand, clawed at Elias Thorne's weathered face as he surveyed the scarred landscape.  The ancient pines, once a cathedral of emerald, were now fractured monuments to the relentless march of the logging industry.  Dust devils, swirling motes of dried pine needles and the faint scent of woodsmoke, danced across the desolate valley floor, a grim ballet mirroring the turmoil in Elias's soul.  He was a man carved from the very heart of the Cascade Mountains, his hands calloused and strong, his eyes the colour of a stormy sky.  Thirty years he had spent felling timber, his life a rhythmic dance with the axe, the saw, the relentless rhythm of the forest's fall.  Today, however, the familiar symphony felt discordant.  The silence was too loud.

The setting sun, a bruised plum in the bruised sky, cast long, jagged shadows across the clearing, revealing a small, dilapidated cabin nestled amongst the skeletal remnants of the old growth.  The cabin, once a sanctuary, was now a hollow shell, its weathered planks creaking under the relentless pressure of the weather, each groan echoing the whisper of loss in Elias' heart.  A single flickering lamplight, the only visible flicker of life, spilled into the gathering gloom, illuminating a worn wooden table.  A half-finished meal and a half-empty bottle of whiskey sat on the table, silent witnesses to a life lived at the forest's edge, a life now teetering on the precipice.
