The warehouse, once a bustling factory, now a monument to forgotten dreams, was humming with a silent energy Elias felt, a low thrumming that reverberated through the very steel of the scaffolding.  He knew, with a certainty that chilled him to the bone, that he wasn't simply fixing a leak. He was confronting something far more sinister.
