The flickering fluorescent lights of the Carnegie Library hummed, a low, insistent drone that seemed to vibrate through Amelia Blackwood's very bones.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the towering oak-paneled shelves, illuminating a swirling vortex of leather-bound volumes and worn, dog-eared paperbacks.  Amelia, a librarian at the sprawling, century-old institution for the past fifteen years, adjusted her glasses, the lenses reflecting the swirling chaos of the library’s interior.  Her name, echoing the hushed reverence of the place, carried a hint of the history housed within its walls.

A forgotten corner, tucked away behind a towering stack of ornithological journals, held the source of her anxiety.  The air in this forgotten alcove hung heavy, thick with the scent of aged paper and something else… something acrid, almost metallic.  This particular section, relegated to the uncatalogued, was notorious.  Rumors whispered that it held books deemed too dangerous, too forbidden, too… *unorthodox*.  Amelia knew better than to trust those whispers, but a persistent feeling of unease clung to her.
