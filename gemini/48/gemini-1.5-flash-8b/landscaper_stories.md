The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's crimson scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks.  Grey clouds, bruised and angry, hung low over the sprawling estate of Lord Ashworth, casting long, skeletal shadows across the meticulously manicured lawns.  Amelia, her hands calloused but nimble, adjusted the wrought-iron shears, their delicate blades glinting in the gloom.  Autumn had arrived with a fury, painting the once vibrant landscape in shades of russet and gold that were quickly being devoured by the encroaching twilight.  This was her third hour of work on the estate, the encroaching darkness a stark reminder of how late she'd become.  Lord Ashworth, famed for his exacting standards, had requested a final, meticulous trimming of the Boxwood hedges before the impending frost.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and pine needles, held a heavy quiet that contrasted sharply with the symphony of rustling leaves just moments before.


Amelia, though usually cheerful, felt a prickle of unease.  The estate, normally a hub of activity with servants scurrying about, was eerily deserted.  Only the whisper of the wind, and the rhythmic snip-snip of her shears, accompanied her.  She had been told the rest of the team had left an hour ago, apparently dismissed by a curt message from Lord Ashworth himself. She was utterly alone with the vast, silent estate, a feeling as chilling as the approaching winter.
