Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the dilapidated fire station, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Captain Amelia "Amy" Hayes.  The air hung thick with the smell of ozone and stale coffee, a familiar aroma that usually calmed her, tonight it only intensified the knot in her stomach.  The old station, nestled at the edge of the rust-colored industrial district of Havenwood, was a relic of a bygone era, a testament to the city's past struggles.  Weathered brick walls, stained with years of soot and grime, held a silent history within their shadowed corners.  Leaking pipes dripped a constant, mournful rhythm onto the concrete floor, amplifying the oppressive silence.  The flickering fluorescent lights cast long, dancing shadows, highlighting the dust motes swirling in the stagnant air. Outside, the storm raged, the cityâ€™s symphony of sirens and car horns muffled by the downpour. Amy knew this night would bring something more than just a typical fire call.  A sense of dread, heavy as the storm clouds, clung to her, a foreboding echo of the whispers circulating through the firehouse.
