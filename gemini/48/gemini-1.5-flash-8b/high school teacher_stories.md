The fluorescent lights of Ms. Elara Nightingale’s classroom hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic tapping of fingers on desks.  Eleven o'clock.  The pre-ap Calculus students, a mix of bored sighs and whispered conversations, were halfway through a lesson on derivatives. Elara, a woman whose auburn hair was pulled back in a tight bun, leaned against the worn wooden surface of her teacher's desk, a faint furrow creasing her brow.  She stared out the dusty, grimy window of Hawthorne High, overlooking the sprawling, neglected lot that had been a vacant space since the fire that consumed the old mill a decade prior.  A single, skeletal willow tree, its branches reaching like clawing fingers toward a bruised sky, was the only living thing to break the monotony of gray.

Hawthorne High, a concrete monolith clinging to the edge of a decaying industrial district, was a school where ambition seemed a forgotten language.  Years of budget cuts, declining enrollment, and a general sense of hopelessness clung to the air like dampened wool.  The worn linoleum floors, the peeling paint, the flickering lights – all hinted at a school adrift, a vessel weathering a storm it seemed powerless to confront. Elara, however, felt a different sort of storm brewing, one within her own heart.
