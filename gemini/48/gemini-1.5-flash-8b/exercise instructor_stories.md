The biting wind whipped Amelia Katherine Dubois's hair across her face as she surveyed the desolate expanse of the High Peak Mountains.  Snow, the consistency of fine, powdered sugar, clung to the jagged peaks, reflecting the harsh, pale light of a November dawn.

Amelia, a seasoned exercise instructor with a passion for pushing boundaries, had driven her battered, four-wheel-drive jeep through treacherous hairpin turns, seeking solace in this secluded retreat.  She craved the stillness, the remoteness, the challenge of forging a new path for her unique fitness program, one tailored to the harsh beauty of the mountains and the resilient spirit of the Oakhaven folk.
