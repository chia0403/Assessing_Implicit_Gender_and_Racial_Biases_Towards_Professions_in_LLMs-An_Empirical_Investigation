The biting London wind whipped through the gaps in the boarded-up windows of the dilapidated theatre, whistling mournful melodies through the empty auditorium.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single bare bulb hanging precariously from the ceiling, danced in the air, mirroring the frantic thoughts swirling in  Arthur Penhaligon's mind.  Arthur Penhaligon, Director of the now-infamous "Grand Guignol," stood amidst the wreckage of his latest production, a Macbeth so meticulously staged, so tragically flawed, it had driven the entire cast into a self-imposed exile.

Setting: The Grand Guignol, a once-renowned, now-deserted theatre in the heart of the impoverished, fog-choked East End of Victorian London.  Cobblestones, slick with rain and refuse, lay before the building's crumbling facade. The air, thick with the smell of coal smoke and damp earth, hung heavy, reflecting the oppressive atmosphere within.  The theatre itself was a monument to decay; paint peeled from the walls, the plush velvet of the seats ripped and stained, the stage littered with discarded props and broken sets.  Empty, echoing spaces suggested a long-lost grandeur, now swallowed by the relentless march of time and disillusionment.
