Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of the "Wanderlust" travel agency, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Amelia "Amie"  Featherstone.  The office, usually a vibrant hive of activity buzzing with the hushed whispers of exotic destinations and the clinking of keyboards, was eerily quiet.  The only sound besides the drumming rain was the rhythmic click-clack of Amieâ€™s meticulously manicured fingernails against the polished mahogany desk.  

Amie, a travel agent with a passion for far-flung locales and an even fiercer passion for impeccable organisation, stared at the overflowing inbox.  Each email, a miniature volcano of urgent requests, threatened to erupt and consume her.  A handwritten note, nestled amongst the digital chaos, caught her eye.  It was from a Mrs. Eleanor Vance, requesting a bespoke, and frankly, improbable, tour of the Amazon rainforest during the height of the monsoon season.  This wasn't just any client.  Mrs. Vance was a seasoned traveller, but she was also known for her exacting demands, a meticulous nature bordering on the obsessive.


The setting was a bustling, yet surprisingly quiet, corner office of the Wanderlust travel agency in the heart of a city choked by grey skies and a constant drizzle.  Rain-streaked skyscrapers pierced the low clouds, their reflections dancing on the wet pavement below.  The air smelled of damp earth and anticipation, a fragrance familiar to Amie, yet tinged with a peculiar, almost unnerving, sense of impending storm.  This was a day where the exotic allure of distant lands felt as far away as the next galaxy.
