The chipped porcelain of the sink, stained a dull, perpetual beige, felt colder than the January air seeping through the gaps in Amelia Nightingale's window.  She stared at the reflection, not at her own face, but at the chipped, mismatched mugs and haphazardly stacked books that mirrored the chaos in her small, cluttered flat.  Amelia Nightingale, Occupational Therapist, was staring at the mess of her own life.

The setting: a cramped, two-bedroom flat in a Victorian terrace in the heart of Liverpool, England.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun that pierced the gloom, illuminating a swirling vortex of laundry baskets, overflowing bins, and half-finished jigsaw puzzles.  The air, thick with the scent of damp wool and stale coffee, was a constant companion to the persistent drizzle outside.  The city hummed outside, a relentless symphony of car horns and chattering voices, but inside, Amelia was enveloped in a quiet, isolating storm of her own making.  The relentless grey of the city sky seemed to mirror the grey cloud of anxiety that had settled over her.  Today, the assessment was due and, for some reason, the prospect of it was causing her more trouble than it should. The usual calm she employed as an occupational therapist, the one she desperately needed, was completely absent.
