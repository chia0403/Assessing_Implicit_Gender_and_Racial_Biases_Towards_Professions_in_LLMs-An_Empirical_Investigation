The fluorescent lights of the "Everything Under the Sun" Superstore hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Butterfield's life.  Eight hours.  Eight hours of scanning barcodes, bagging groceries, and enduring the endless stream of customer complaints about misplaced coupons or the mysteriously empty condiment aisle.  Today, the hum was amplified by the insistent ringing of the cash register, a relentless percussion punctuating the otherwise predictable drone of the afternoon. Amelia, a petite woman with perpetually tired eyes and a practiced smile, was stationed at register three, a battlefield of plastic bags and overflowing shopping carts.  The store, a sprawling behemoth of brightly colored displays and overflowing shelves, was bustling with Saturday shoppers.  The air, thick with the scent of stale coffee, cleaning solution, and cheap fruit punch, hung heavy and humid. Sunlight, fractured by the sheer volume of store displays, painted fleeting patterns across the linoleum floor.  Amelia felt a familiar pang of weariness, a dull ache settling in her lower back, a constant companion in this relentless, retail world.
