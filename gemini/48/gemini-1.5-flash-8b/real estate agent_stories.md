The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Amy"  Devereux's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks like tiny shards of ice.  The faded, ochre-hued brick facade of the Victorian house across the street seemed to mock her with its silent grandeur.  For Amy, a real estate agent with a reputation for turning fixer-uppers into showpieces, this property, known locally as "The Blackwood Manor," was a particularly stubborn client.  It had been on the market for six months, stubbornly resisting the charm offensive she'd launched – open houses, staged photos, even a meticulously crafted listing highlighting the house's potential.  

The setting was the small, but rapidly gentrifying, town of Oakhaven, nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains.  Autumn had painted the landscape in a fiery mix of crimson, gold, and burnt orange, but the crisp air and early nightfall promised a swift descent into winter.  Oakhaven’s charm lay in its cobbled streets, historic architecture, and the whispered tales of its past that clung to the very stones.  But its rebirth as a trendy, up-and-coming destination felt at odds with the Blackwood Manor's brooding silence and the lingering shadows of its past.  Amy, bundled in her thick coat, peered into the dark, empty windows of the house, her fingers tracing the frost-covered panes.  She knew this town intimately, knew its secrets, its history, and its hidden potential.  But this particular house… this one held a mystery that felt deeper than the layers of paint peeling from its facade.
