The biting wind whipped at Amelia "Milly"  Kingsley's flight suit, stinging her cheeks and rattling the fragile framework of the Sky-Hawk's cockpit.  Below, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Tooth Mountains clawed at the bruised twilight sky.  A swirling vortex of snow-dust obscured the valley, a silent, terrifying maelstrom that seemed to consume the very air itself.  Milly, her knuckles white around the controls, fought to maintain the Sky-Hawkâ€™s precarious ascent.  The engine roared, a desperate counterpoint to the howling wind, the only sound beyond the rhythmic thump of her heart.   She'd been warned about this weather, warned about the infamous blizzard that always descended on the Dragon's Tooth Pass in the dead of winter, but no warning could have prepared her for this.  Tonight, the storm felt personally hostile, as if the very mountains themselves were trying to swallow her whole.
