The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow over Amelia Nightingale's tired face.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless percussion that mirrored the rhythmic thump of her heart.  The small, smoky bar was her sanctuary, her cage, her everything, and tonight, it was holding a particularly bitter brew of loneliness.  Outside, the city of Veridian sprawled under a bruised twilight sky, a sprawling tapestry of lights and shadows.  Veridian, a metropolis built on the promise of shimmering futures, felt more like a graveyard tonight.  Amelia, with her perpetually smudged eyeliner and chipped nail polish, was the only one who knew the dead had a way of congregating in the dimly lit corners of the Rusty Mug.


The year was 2042.  Veridian, once a hub of innovation and excitement, now felt choked by a creeping despair.  The shimmering skyscrapers, once symbols of technological advancement, now seemed like hollow shells, their windows reflecting a city that had lost its luster. The constant hum of advanced machinery that had defined the cityâ€™s rhythm was muted by a pervasive silence, broken only by the clinking of glasses, the muffled conversations, and the occasional, almost mournful, wail of a drone that swept silently through the air. This hum of urban angst hung heavy in the air, an unwelcome accompaniment to the stale beer and cheap whiskey that was Amelia's comfort, or perhaps, her prison.
