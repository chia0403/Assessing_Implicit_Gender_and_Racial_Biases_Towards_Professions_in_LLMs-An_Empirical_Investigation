The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine and something subtly metallic, like old pennies.  Dr. Amelia Kensington, meticulously adjusting the strap of her canvas tote bag, took a deep breath, trying to ignore the sickly sweet smell emanating from the small, cluttered shop.  It wasn't the aroma of fresh fruit, or even the vaguely floral tang of overripe mangoes; this was something else entirely, something unsettling.
