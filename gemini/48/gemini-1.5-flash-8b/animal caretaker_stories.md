The biting wind, a relentless harbinger of winter, whipped across the exposed moorland, rattling the corrugated iron roof of the Otterhaven Animal Sanctuary.  Dust devils danced across the parched earth, swirling around the skeletal remains of last summer's wildflowers.  Elara Blackwood, Animal Caretaker Extraordinaire, shivered, not from the cold, but from a profound sense of foreboding.  Her worn leather boots crunched on the frosty gravel path as she made her nightly rounds.  The sanctuary, a sprawling patchwork of enclosures and dilapidated buildings, stretched before her like a skeletal hand clawing at the darkening sky.  This was her kingdom, her responsibility, a fragile ecosystem teetering on the precipice of a harsh winter.


**Setting:** Otterhaven Animal Sanctuary, a sprawling, somewhat dilapidated facility nestled in the windswept moorlands of northern England.  The landscape is bleak, punctuated by the remnants of summer and the stark reality of approaching winter.  The sanctuary itself feels a little forgotten, its various animal enclosures clinging to survival against the unforgiving elements.  A sense of isolation, both geographical and emotional, pervades the air.
