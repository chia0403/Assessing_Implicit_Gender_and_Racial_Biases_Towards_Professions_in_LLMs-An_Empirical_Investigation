The flickering fluorescent lights of the emergency room hummed, a monotonous counterpoint to the frantic pulse of the city outside.  Rain hammered against the windowpanes, mirroring the relentless rhythm of Amelia "Amy"  Parkinson's heart.  Amy, a third-year paramedic with the Metro Emergency Response Unit, stared at the electrocardiogram, the jagged lines a terrifying symphony of chaos.  The patient, a young woman named Sofia, lay pale and still on the gurney, her breathing shallow and ragged.  The sterile white walls of the ER, usually a comforting presence, felt oppressive, a cage of clinical perfection surrounding the fragile life before her.  Amy felt the familiar knot of dread tightening in her stomach.  This wasn't just another run.  This felt different, heavier.  

The setting:  A bustling, rain-soaked city on the East Coast, sometime in the fall. The Metro Emergency Response Unit's headquarters, a modern, sprawling building located in the heart of the city's vibrant but often overlooked inner-city district, housed a perpetually chaotic emergency room brimming with a diverse spectrum of patients – from the everyday cuts and sprains to the complex cardiac emergencies that filled Amy’s professional life with high stakes decisions. The humid air in the room, thick with the smells of antiseptic and fear, reflected the pressure that hung heavy in the room.
