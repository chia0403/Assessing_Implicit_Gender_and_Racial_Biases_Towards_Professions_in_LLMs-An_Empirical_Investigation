The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Emerald City" antique shop hummed a discordant tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic click-clack of Amelia Petrova's screwdriver against the corroded brass of a vintage gramophone. Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom of the back room, illuminating a haze of forgotten treasures.  Amelia, a wiry woman with calloused hands and eyes that held the quiet intensity of a seasoned electrician, swore she could hear the faint whisper of music from within the machine.  This wasn't just a repair; it was a journey into the past, a conversation with a forgotten era.  The shop, a sprawling labyrinth of dimly lit aisles, stacked high with dusty furniture and tarnished trinkets, was her current domain, her mobile office, her sanctuary from the relentless drone of modern life.  Outside, the bustling city of Neo-Veridian roared with the incessant symphony of traffic, a sound Amelia almost wished she could shut out.  She was here, though, lost in the hushed tones of the old world, connected to it through the subtle dance of wires and circuits.
