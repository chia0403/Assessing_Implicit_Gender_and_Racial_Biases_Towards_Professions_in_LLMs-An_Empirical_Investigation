The flickering fluorescent lights of the emergency room hummed, a relentless, almost hypnotic drone.  Rain lashed against the windows of St. Jude’s Hospital, mimicking the frantic rhythm of Amelia Blackwood’s heart.  She, a Registered Nurse with five years of experience, felt the familiar weight of the night settle upon her shoulders.  The air, thick with the metallic tang of blood and the antiseptic smell of disinfectant, was almost palpable.  Tonight, it held a particular, almost suffocating tension.  Outside, the city roared with a tempestuous symphony of sirens and distant thunder.

Inside the room, a young man, no older than twenty, lay unconscious on the gurney.  His breath, shallow and ragged, filled the silence with a barely audible whisper.  His eyes, the colour of storm clouds just before dawn, were shut tight, and his chest rose and fell with the laboured effort of life ebbing and flowing.  Amelia knew, with the sickening certainty that came with years of experience, that this young man,  her patient, was in critical condition.
