The chipped paint of the Ms. Amelia Hawthorne's classroom door, a faded shade of robin's egg blue, seemed to sigh in the humid afternoon air.  Sunlight, fractured into a thousand diamonds by the dusty windowpanes, illuminated the rows of meticulously arranged desks, each a miniature island of quiet concentration.  Empty juice boxes lay scattered like fallen leaves on the worn linoleum floor, a testament to the midday snack break just past.  Amelia Hawthorne, a woman with eyes the colour of polished jade and a smile that could thaw a glacier, surveyed her domain.  Today, the fifth grade was lost in a whirlwind of fractions, their tiny brows furrowed in concentration as they attempted to grasp the elusive concept of common denominators. Amelia, however, wasn't looking for answers. She was looking for something else entirely.  A whisper of a lost secret, perhaps, a hidden desire buried beneath the veneer of youthful energy.  And then she saw it â€“ a single, crumpled piece of paper tucked beneath a stack of colourful construction paper near Lily Chen's desk.  Her heart stirred a little, and she knew this would be an interesting day.
