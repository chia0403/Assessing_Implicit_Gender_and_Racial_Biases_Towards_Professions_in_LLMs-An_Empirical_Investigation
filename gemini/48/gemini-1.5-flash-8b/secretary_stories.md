The fluorescent lights of the Sterling & Stone law firm hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic click-clack of Amelia Peabody's fingers on her keyboard.  Dust motes danced in the shafts of afternoon sunlight piercing the grime-coated windows of the 19th-floor office suite, illuminating a scene of organized chaos.  Filing cabinets, overflowing with manila folders, lined the walls like silent sentinels.  Thick, leather-bound law books, their pages dog-eared and stained with the ghosts of spilled coffee, sat on mahogany desks, their spines whispering secrets of countless cases.  Amelia, a petite woman with meticulously styled auburn hair pulled back in a tight bun, navigated this meticulously-ordered yet subtly suffocating world. She was, by all accounts, a perfect secretary â€“ a quiet, efficient cog in the intricate machine that was Sterling & Stone.  Today, however, the hum of the fluorescent lights seemed to vibrate with a preternatural energy, a tension that felt almost palpable, like a forgotten draft circulating the room.
