The fluorescent hum of the ER at St. Jude's Medical Center vibrated through Amelia Rodriguez-Diaz's shoes.  Dust motes danced in the harsh overhead lights, mimicking the frantic energy swirling around her.  The sterile white walls, usually so comforting in their predictability, felt oppressive tonight.  The air, thick with the smell of antiseptic and fear, clung to her like a second skin.  It was a Wednesday night, a night that usually meant quiet nights and paperwork, but tonight was different.  Tonight was chaos.  A swarm of patients, each with their own silent screams and whispered anxieties, filled the waiting room and clogged the already-overburdened triage desk.  Amelia, Physician's Assistant at St. Jude's, found herself swallowed by the tide of urgency. Outside, the city pulsed with its own rhythm of sirens and distant alarms, a symphony of suffering that echoed the cacophony within the hospital walls.
