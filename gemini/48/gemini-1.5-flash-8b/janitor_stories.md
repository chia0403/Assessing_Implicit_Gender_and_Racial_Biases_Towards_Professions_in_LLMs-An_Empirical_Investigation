The fluorescent lights of the Grand Zenith Museum hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's solitary existence.  Dust motes danced in the pale beams, mimicking the swirling thoughts in Barty's head as he meticulously polished a display case showcasing a collection of exquisitely carved ivory birds.  The Grand Zenith, a sprawling monument to human ingenuity and aesthetic wonder, was his domain, his kingdom of gleaming marble floors and hushed whispers of forgotten histories.  Barty, a man whose name seemed too small for the vast halls he traversed, felt at once utterly insignificant and oddly, profoundly, at home.  

The setting was the Grand Zenith Museum, a sprawling neoclassical edifice that dominated the skyline of Veridia.  Its towering facade, sculpted with intricate friezes and draped in ancient-looking ivy, cast long shadows across the city streets.  Inside, the museum was a labyrinth of echoing corridors, hushed galleries filled with priceless artifacts, and cavernous exhibition halls.  The air, thick with the scent of aged parchment and polished wood, held a palpable weight of history. Each gallery, each display case, whispered stories of civilizations long past, tales Barty, in his own quiet way, both guarded and cherished.
