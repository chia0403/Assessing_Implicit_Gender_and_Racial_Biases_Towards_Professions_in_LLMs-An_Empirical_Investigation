The biting wind, a relentless, icy knife, whipped across the desolate expanse of the Wyoming plains.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of sun-baked earth, danced across the cracked blacktop, obscuring the already meagre view.  This was the domain of  Elias Thorne, highway maintenance worker, and today, the domain was more desolate than usual.  The snow, which had piled high a week prior, had finally melted, leaving behind a slick, treacherous layer of ice clinging to the vast, grey concrete ribbon of Interstate 80.  

Elias Thorne, a man built like a weathered oak, his face a roadmap of sun-etched lines and frostbitten weariness, adjusted the heavy parka that nearly swallowed him whole.  His breath, a plume of white mist in the frigid air, hung momentarily before dissolving into the swirling dust.  The abandoned roadside diner, a faded ghost of a building where the paint was peeling like sunburnt skin, cast a melancholy shadow.  It had been empty for months, a testament to the encroaching emptiness of the surrounding landscape.  The only other evidence of human presence was the intermittent roar of passing semi-trucks, their metal bellies shuddering through the skeletal frame of the world.
