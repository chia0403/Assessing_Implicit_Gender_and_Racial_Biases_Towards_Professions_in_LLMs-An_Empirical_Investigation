The chipped Formica countertop, stained a sickly yellow from years of spilled coffee and forgotten mugs, reflected the flickering neon sign of the "Rusty Spoon" diner.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the already faded floral wallpaper.  This was the only sanctuary from the tempest brewing inside Eleanor Vance, a singer who, more often than not, found solace in the predictable rhythms of stale coffee and the monotonous murmur of the diner regulars.

Eleanor Vance, a wisp of a woman with eyes that held the stormy grey of a late afternoon sky, stared at her reflection in the clouded glass.  The faded, velvet dress, once a vibrant emerald green, hung loosely on her frame, a stark contrast to the vibrant melodies that lived in her heart.  Tonight, the Rusty Spoon was hosting its annual "Harmony Has No Home" open mic night, a night Eleanor had dreamed of for months. Tonight, her dreams were about to crash into reality, or into the stale bread crumbs clinging to the worn vinyl booths.
