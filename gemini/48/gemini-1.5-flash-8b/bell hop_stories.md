The chipped porcelain of the sink, stained a perpetual beige from years of lukewarm water and forgotten soapsuds, reflected the flickering gaslight above.  Dust motes danced in the weak illumination, tracing invisible patterns in the air.  This was the back room of the Grand Imperial Hotel, a space swallowed by shadows and echoing with the distant murmur of conversations from the bustling lobby.  Augustus Finch, bell hop extraordinaire (though he’d be hard-pressed to claim the title with a straight face), meticulously polished a brass tray.  He adjusted his worn, navy-blue uniform, the crispness of the fabric a stark contrast to the grimy reality of his surroundings.  Each meticulous stroke of the polishing cloth was a silent prayer for a better day, a prayer he felt was often unanswered.  Outside, the city of Veridian, a sprawling metropolis choked by smog and ambition, slumbered, its secrets tucked away within the winding alleyways that snaked beneath the hotel's imposing façade.
