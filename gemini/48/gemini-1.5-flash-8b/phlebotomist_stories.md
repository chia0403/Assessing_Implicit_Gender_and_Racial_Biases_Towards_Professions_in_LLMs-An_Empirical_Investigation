The sterile hum of the pneumatic tube system in the back of the city hospital was Elias Thorne's lullaby.  Heâ€™d been listening to it, and the rhythmic *thump-thump* of the heart monitors in the adjacent room, for nearly four hours.  The fluorescent lights of the blood bank, usually a harsh glare, seemed almost comforting now, casting long shadows that danced with the dust motes floating in the stale air.  Elias, a phlebotomist with a penchant for meticulousness bordering on the obsessive, meticulously arranged the vials of blood on the stainless steel cart. Each one, a miniature universe, contained a story he couldn't read, yet felt compelled to respect.

The setting was the bustling, perpetually-fragrant blood bank of St. Jude's Hospital in the heart of a sprawling metropolis.  Steel and glass, gleaming and antiseptic, dominated the architecture of the building.  The metallic scent of disinfectant, blended with the faint, sweet smell of antiseptic and the distant, metallic tang of blood, hung thick in the air. The rhythmic clang of the pneumatic tube system was a constant reminder of the unseen flow of life, and death, passing through the silent corridors.
