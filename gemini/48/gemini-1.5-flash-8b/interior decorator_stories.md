Rain lashed against the arched windows of Amelia Butterfield's antique shop, a symphony of drumming that mirrored the frantic rhythm of her thoughts.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom, illuminating swirling patterns of crimson velvet drapes and polished mahogany furniture, all vying for her attention.  Amelia, a whirlwind of a woman with sapphire eyes and hair the colour of midnight, paced the narrow aisles, the scent of aged leather and beeswax clinging to her.  This was no ordinary Saturday.  This was the day the prestigious Blackwood Manor, a sprawling Victorian behemoth perched precariously on a hill overlooking the town, had finally put its interiors, and its future, in her capable—or so she hoped—hands.

Vast rooms, echoing with the whispers of bygone eras, held within their confines a story Amelia was eager to unearth, a story she hoped to transform into a breathtaking narrative through the careful arrangement of objects and colour palettes.  But this afternoon, the weight of expectation pressed down on her like a leaden shroud, threatening to suffocate her creativity.  The Blackwood family’s reputation, intertwined with the mansion's history, loomed large, a looming question hanging heavy in the air. Could she, a relatively young decorator fresh from a string of successes, possibly match the expectations of such a demanding legacy?
