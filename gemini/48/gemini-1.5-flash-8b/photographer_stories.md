Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the abandoned bodega, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic rhythm of Elara Reyes's heart.  The air, thick with the smell of damp earth and decaying oranges, hung heavy in the claustrophobic space.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light slicing through the grimy window, illuminating Elara's camera bag, a familiar weight in her arms.  She was here, in this forgotten corner of the city, chasing the ephemeral light that painted the peeling plaster walls with a ghostly palette of grey and ochre. Elara Reyes, a photographer known for her portraits of forgotten corners, sought a fleeting moment of beauty amidst the urban decay.  The bodega, once a hub of bustling activity, now stood as a silent testament to time's relentless passage, a perfect canvas for her lens.
