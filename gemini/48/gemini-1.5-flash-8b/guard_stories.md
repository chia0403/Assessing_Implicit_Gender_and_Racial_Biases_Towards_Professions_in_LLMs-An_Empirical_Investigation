The biting wind whipped across the cobbled plaza, stinging Sergeant Alistair Finch's cheeks and rattling the iron bars of the gatehouse.  Dust motes danced in the pale, winter sun, illuminating the chipped carvings on the ancient stone walls that enclosed the city of Aethelgard.  He shivered, not just from the cold, but from the creeping dread that settled in his gut like a lead weight.  The city, normally a bustling hub of activity, was eerily quiet.  The usual chorus of hawkers, the rhythmic clanging of blacksmiths' hammers, the laughter of children playing â€“ all were absent, replaced by an unnerving silence that pressed down on him like a physical presence.  He adjusted the worn leather strap of his sword, the familiar weight a small comfort against the foreboding atmosphere.  The last patrol had reported nothing out of the ordinary.  But Sergeant Finch had a feeling that something was rotten in the heart of Aethelgard.
