The biting wind whipped at Amelia "Ace"  Charleston's weathered face, stinging her cheeks like a thousand tiny needles.  Dust devils, the colour of burnt umber, danced across the cracked asphalt of the desolate Interstate 80.  Sunrise, a pale, bruised peach, struggled to pierce the grey-purple horizon, casting long, skeletal shadows that stretched like grasping fingers across the desolate landscape.  Ace, her name a testament to the grit embedded in her soul, gripped the worn steering wheel of her rig, the rhythmic thump of the engine a comforting counterpoint to the howling wind.  Her rig, a beat-up but loyal Freightliner named "The Colossus", groaned beneath the weight of a thousand frozen dreams and the unspoken stories of the endless highway.  The year was 1988, and the only sound besides the wind and the engine, was the distant, mournful cry of a lone hawk circling high above the plains of Wyoming.
