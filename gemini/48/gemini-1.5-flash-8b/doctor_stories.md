The biting wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Nightingale's coat around her as she hurried down the cobbled streets of Veridia, the city perched precariously on the slopes of the volcanic peaks.  Dust devils danced in the air, swirling ash-grey clouds that clung to the worn stone buildings and stained the already muted colours of the sky.  Veridia, a city of whispers and shadows, felt as though it held its breath, waiting.  Amy, a renowned pediatric cardiologist with eyes the colour of storm clouds and a sharp, quick mind,  felt a tremor of unease deep within her.  This wasn't just a typical Veridian dust storm. This felt... ominous.  The air hung thick with a metallic tang, a scent unusual even for this volcanic region.  Her worn leather satchel, crammed with her instruments and charts, felt heavy against her hip.  The urgent beeping of her small, antique communication device, nestled inside the satchel, was the only other sound that pierced the silence.  It was a signal, a call from the heart of the city, a call she couldn't ignore.
