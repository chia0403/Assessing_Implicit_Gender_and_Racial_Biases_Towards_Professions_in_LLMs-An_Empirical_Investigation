The fluorescent lights of the "Tax Relief Specialists" office hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia Hayes's relentless clicking.  Paper, in varying shades of beige and grey, littered her desk like fallen leaves in autumn.  Stacks of meticulously organized forms, each a tiny, silent plea for a smaller tax bill, stood sentinel around her.  Amelia, a woman whose sharp eyes and even sharper wit were often mistaken for impatience, was currently wrestling with a particularly convoluted Schedule C.  The client, a struggling artisan specializing in hand-carved wooden birdhouses, seemed to have more deductions than birds in her backyard.  The tiny workshop, nestled in the overgrown lot behind her downtown office, was a concrete testament to the quiet struggles of the working class.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun filtering through the grime-covered windows, illuminating the faded posters of tax deadlines and highlighting the chipped paint on the walls.  The city's relentless roar of traffic thrummed just beyond the window, a constant reminder of the world outside her contained, paper-filled reality. Amelia, though, was entirely focused on the intricate dance of numbers before her, the delicate dance of income, deductions, and the all-important tax burden.
