The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual beige from years of lukewarm water and forgotten dish soap, felt oddly cold against Elara Thistlewick's palm.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single, flickering bulb hanging precariously above, danced in the air like tiny, spectral dancers.  The grand, echoing halls of Blackwood Manor, usually a symphony of hushed footsteps and rustling silks, were now eerily silent.  It was 2 AM, and Elara, Blackwood Manor's housekeeper, was the only soul stirring within its ancient walls.

The manor itself was a testament to forgotten opulence.  Massive, arched windows framed portraits of long-dead ancestors, their painted smiles seeming to watch her with unnerving intensity.  Tapestries, woven with scenes of mythical beasts and forgotten heroes, hung heavy on the walls, their colours muted by time and neglect.  The scent of aged woodsmoke and something indefinably floral, like a wilting garden, hung in the air, a ghostly echo of a life lived lavishly and long ago.  Statues of mythical creatures – griffins, satyrs, and nymphs – adorned every available surface, their stone eyes seemingly following her every movement.  The house whispered secrets, and Elara, with her worn leather-bound ledger and lantern, was its unwilling listener.
