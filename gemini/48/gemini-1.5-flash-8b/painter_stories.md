The chipped paint on the gallery walls, a faded imitation of the vibrant blues and yellows Amelia "Maisie"  Abernathy poured onto canvas, seemed to mock her.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grime-coated window, illuminating a palette knife stained crimson where Maisie had been working on a still life of wilting sunflowers.  The gallery, "The Painted Palette," was more a testament to faded glories than a thriving hub of artistic expression.  A thin layer of dust clung to the velvet ropes, muffling the faint, almost imperceptible hum of the city outside.  Maisie, her own paint-smeared hands trembling, traced the outline of a drooping petal, the vibrant hues of her masterpiece fading against the muted backdrop of disinterest.  The gallery had been her mother's life's work, but it had been losing its vibrancy for years.  This particular day felt especially desolate.
