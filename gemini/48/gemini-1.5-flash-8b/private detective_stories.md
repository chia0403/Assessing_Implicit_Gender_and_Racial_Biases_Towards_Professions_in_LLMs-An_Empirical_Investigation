The flickering neon sign of the "Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow across the rain-slicked cobblestones of  Oldport.  The scent of brine, mingled with the acrid tang of cheap cigarettes and something vaguely floral – perhaps jasmine from a forgotten florist – hung heavy in the air.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the alleyway where DETECTIVE ARTHUR PENHALIGON,  a man whose face seemed etched with the city's own grime and weariness, hunched against the damp brick wall.  He squinted, his gaze tracing the shadows that danced with the light, his fedora pulled low over his eyes.  This was not the kind of case that promised a quick payday or a satisfying resolution. This case smelled of secrets, of whispers carried on the wind, and of something far more dangerous than a petty theft.
