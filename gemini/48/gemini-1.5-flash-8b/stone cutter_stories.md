The biting wind whipped across the jagged peaks of the Silvan Mountains, stinging Elara Stonehandâ€™s cheeks as she hauled another block of glacial granite.  Dust, the colour of aged parchment, swirled around her, obscuring the already formidable face of Mount Cinderpeak.  For a decade, Elara Stonehand, a cutter of stone as old as the mountains themselves, had carved her existence into the very heart of this unforgiving landscape.  The mountain, with its sharp, granite ridges and perpetually shadowed valleys, held a power that mirrored her own relentless spirit.


High above the valley, nestled in a precarious alcove carved out of the mountainside, lay the village of Skyhold.  Small, clinging to the craggy slopes as if afraid of falling, Skyhold was a testament to human resilience.  Its stone houses, weathered and grey, were linked by precarious pathways that felt like they could collapse at any moment. The scent of pine needles and damp earth mingled with the sharp tang of minerals, a constant reminder of the mountain's stony embrace.  Elara, a woman hardened by years of relentless work, felt the mountain's pulse thrumming through her very bones.  Each swing of her hammer echoed through the silent valleys, a defiant anthem against the vast, indifferent world.
