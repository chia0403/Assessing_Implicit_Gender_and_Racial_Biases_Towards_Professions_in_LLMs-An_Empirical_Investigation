The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual lavender from decades of lukewarm tea and spilled frosting, reflected the flickering gaslight above Amelia "Amy" Butterfield's head.  Dust motes danced in the pale glow, illuminating a chaotic tableau of half-eaten macarons, discarded icing tips, and a forlorn, half-assembled wedding cake in the shape of a rather ungainly swan.  Amy, her fingers stained a vibrant magenta from the latest batch of raspberry buttercream, sighed, the sound lost in the hushed hum of the old Victorian house.  It was a Wednesday, typically a slow day, but tonight held a particular kind of oppressive quiet. The air in her tiny, cluttered bakery – or rather, cake studio, as she preferred to call it – hung thick with the aroma of vanilla and impending doom.  The city outside, usually a cacophony of honking cars and chattering crowds, was strangely muted. The only sound was the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the hall, counting down the minutes until the night’s deadline – a deadline she wasn't sure she could possibly meet.  

The setting was the sprawling, yet somehow intimate, Victorian neighborhood of Elmwood in the city of Oakhaven, nestled amidst towering oaks and brick row houses.  The city itself was a hub of industry and commerce, but Elmwood possessed a timeless charm, a whisper of a past era. Amy's bakery, tucked away on a side street, was a testament to this history, its faded paint and mismatched windows hinting at its age, but the vibrant colours within revealed a spirited soul.  Inside, the antique wooden counters gleamed under the gaslight, contrasting with the modern, exquisite cakes that sat displayed, ready to be enjoyed.
