The scent of lilies, jasmine, and something faintly metallic hung heavy in the air of "The Bloomery," Amelia Nightingale's small, but exquisitely crafted, flower shop.  Sunlight, fractured into a thousand prisms by the stained-glass window depicting a weeping willow, illuminated dust motes dancing in the air.  Amelia, a woman whose auburn hair seemed to catch the light like the petals of a poppy, meticulously arranged a bouquet of deep crimson roses.  Each stem, a perfect specimen, was carefully cradled in its designated spot, a silent symphony of colour and form.  The shop, tucked away on a cobbled lane in the heart of the Old Town, was a haven of quiet beauty, a place where the clatter of city life faded to a soft murmur outside the wooden door, replaced by the hushed whisper of rustling silk and the gentle hum of bees flitting around exotic blooms.  Today, however, a different kind of sound, a low, persistent thrumming, echoed in the back room, a sound that unsettled Amelia.
