His hands, calloused and stained a muddy brown, tightened around a wrench, the metallic tang of copper and despair mixing in the air.  Barty, thirty-two years old and perpetually weary, felt the familiar weight of responsibility settle upon his shoulders, a tangible leaden burden in the damp, echoing space.  Tonight, the relentless pressure of the city's plumbing woes had coalesced into a perfect storm of emergencies, and Barty, despite his exhaustion, knew he was about to be drawn into another frantic dance with disaster.
