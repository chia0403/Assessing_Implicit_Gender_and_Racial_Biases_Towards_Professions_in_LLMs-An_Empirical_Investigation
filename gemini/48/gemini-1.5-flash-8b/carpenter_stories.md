The rasping groan of the saw echoed through the dusty attic, a mournful counterpoint to the insistent drumming of rain against the old shingle roof.  Dust motes, disturbed by the rhythmic clang, danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom.  Elias Thorne, his face creased with the lines of a thousand hammer blows and the wisdom of weathered wood, hunched over his workbench.  Years had etched themselves into the weathered oak planks of the attic, mirroring the lines on his own weathered hands.  He was a carpenter, a craftsman, a whisperer of stories in wood. But tonight, the stories whispered only of sorrow.
 
Setting: A dusty, sun-dappled attic, high above a sprawling, centuries-old manor house.  Rain lashed against the aged shingles, mirroring the turmoil in Elias Thorne's heart.  The air hung heavy with the scent of old wood and damp earth.  Cobwebs, thick as shrouds, draped from rafters, obscuring forgotten treasures and dusty memories.  Scattered tools – chisels, planes, hammers – lay discarded amongst the tools and unfinished projects.  The whole space pulsed with a quiet, expectant energy, a waiting room for unseen forces.
