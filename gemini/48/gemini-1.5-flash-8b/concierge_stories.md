The rain hammered against the terracotta tiles of the courtyard, a relentless tattoo that mirrored the frantic rhythm of Amelia Blackwood's heart.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and jasmine, hung heavy, a suffocating blanket over the sprawling, centuries-old manor of Blackwood Hall.  Amelia, a concierge of impeccable composure and practiced efficiency, adjusted the worn velvet of her sleeve, the subtle sheen catching the flickering candlelight in the grand foyer.  Each drip, each creak of the ancient oak timbers, amplified the growing unease in her stomach.  Tonight, the usual hushed murmur of the Blackwood family and their esteemed guests was replaced by an unnerving silence.  A silence punctuated only by the insistent drumming of the rain.

Rain-slicked cobblestones, winding paths, and shadowed gardens formed a labyrinthine landscape draped in a perpetual twilight.  The grand foyer, with its soaring ceilings, intricate tapestries, and flickering candlelight, offered a stark contrast to the gloom outside.  The air crackled with unspoken anxieties and the hushed whispers of secrets.
