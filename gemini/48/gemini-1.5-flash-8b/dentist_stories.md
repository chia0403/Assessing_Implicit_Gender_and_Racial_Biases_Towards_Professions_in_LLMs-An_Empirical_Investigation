The flickering fluorescent lights of Dr. Amelia Hayes's dental office hummed, a monotonous counterpoint to the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of her tools against enamel.  Dust motes danced in the pale beams, illuminating the sterile white walls and the gleaming chrome fixtures of the small, slightly cramped practice nestled on the corner of Elm and Maple.  Outside, the relentless November rain hammered against the windows, mirroring the storm brewing within Amelia.  

The afternoon was unusually slow, a lull in the usual torrent of patients, and the silence, punctuated only by the rhythmic whir of the air conditioner, felt oppressive.  Amelia, a woman of sharp angles and even sharper wit,  found herself staring at the faint smudges on the porcelain sink, each one representing a life, a story, a fleeting moment of pain and relief â€“ all captured and processed in the intimate confines of her practice.  She traced the outline of one particularly stubborn coffee stain with a gloved finger, a faint smile playing on her lips, tinged with a wry melancholia.  It was a familiar feeling, this quiet before the inevitable storm.  A storm that, in her profession, often arrived with a clenched jaw and a toothache.
