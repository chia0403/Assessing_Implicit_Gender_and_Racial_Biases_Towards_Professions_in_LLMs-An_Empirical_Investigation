The fluorescent lights of the accounting firm, "Precision Numbers," hummed a monotonous lullaby, a soundtrack to Amelia Nightingale’s relentless calculations.  The air, thick with the scent of stale coffee and recycled paper, clung to Amelia like a second skin.  Empty plastic water bottles, scattered like discarded hopes, littered the cluttered desks.  Year after year, the same predictable rhythm: balance sheets, invoices, tax forms – a never-ending dance with numbers, a ballet of the mundane.  Amelia, a meticulous accountant with a penchant for perfectly organized folders and a perpetually tired smile, stared at the projected income statement, a complex tapestry of figures mocking her with their unyielding logic.  The figures, cold and impersonal, held no meaning beyond their numerical value.  Tonight, however, something felt…off.  A subtle tremor in the digits, a discordant note in the symphony of numbers.
