## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The humid, pre-dawn air hung thick and heavy outside Terminal C at Miami International Airport. The sky was just beginning to bleed a pale, bruised purple at the horizon, promising another scorching South Florida day. The rhythmic hum of idling jet engines and the distant groan of baggage handlers formed a gritty, industrial symphony that Beatrice Eleanor Moreau had come to both loathe and crave.

**Opening:**

Beatrice Eleanor Moreau checked her reflection one last time in the polished chrome of the crew room door. The fluorescent lighting cast harsh shadows, highlighting the faint lines etched around her kind, hazel eyes. She smoothed the crisp navy fabric of her uniform jacket, adjusted the periwinkle silk scarf tied at her throat, and pasted on a practiced smile. It was a smile that could soothe a screaming toddler, deflect a drunken passenger's clumsy advances, and assure even the most anxious flyer that everything was perfectly under control. It was, in essence, her most valuable tool.

Today, that tool was going to be tested.

Flight 312 to Rio de Janeiro was notoriously unpredictable. A mix of weary business travelers, giddy honeymooners, and homesick expats made for a volatile cocktail at 30,000 feet. And Bea, as she was known to her colleagues, had drawn the short straw as the lead flight attendant. She took a deep breath, the scent of industrial cleaner and stale coffee filling her lungs. Showtime. With a final tug at her jacket, she pushed through the door and stepped into the controlled chaos of the pre-boarding ritual, the well-worn click of her sensible heels echoing in the sterile hallway. The day, she knew, was just beginning.
