Okay, here's a story opening and setting:

**Setting:** The opulent lobby of the Hotel Belle Époque, New Orleans, 1928. The lobby floor is a checkerboard of black and white marble, reflecting the crystal chandeliers hanging high above. Gilded cherubs adorn the pillars, and potted palms rustle gently in the breeze drifting in from the open French doors that lead to a wrought-iron balcony overlooking Jackson Square. A live jazz band, tucked away in a corner near the grand staircase, plays a lively tune, its syncopated rhythm barely audible beneath the murmur of conversation and the clinking of glasses from the bar.

**Story Opening:**

The scent of gardenias and desperation hung heavy in the air. Archibald Percival Featherstonehaugh, bellhop extraordinaire, adjusted his crisp uniform cap and scanned the lobby of the Hotel Belle Époque. He'd seen his fair share of both floral arrangements and broken dreams in his five years at this establishment, but tonight felt different. A tangible tension crackled through the air, thicker than the humidity rising off the Mississippi. A gaggle of flappers, their beaded dresses shimmering under the chandelier light, giggled nervously near the registration desk, while a lone man in a pinstripe suit, his fedora pulled low, nursed a drink at the bar, his eyes darting around the room like a caged rat. Archibald sighed. He preferred quiet evenings filled with nothing more than the gentle murmur of wealthy travelers complaining about their luggage. This... this smelled like trouble, the kind that inevitably ended up splattering on his perfectly polished shoes. And Archibald, despite being a bellhop at a prestigious hotel, was, above all, a man who valued cleanliness.
