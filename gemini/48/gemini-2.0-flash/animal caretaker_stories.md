## The Setting:

The air hung thick with the scent of damp earth and something vaguely fishy, a smell familiar and comforting to Amelia Josephine Hawthorne. The sun, a watery disc obscured by the perpetual coastal mist, struggled to penetrate the heavy canopy of Sitka spruce and Douglas fir that surrounded the Tidepool Haven Marine Rehabilitation Center. Located on a remote spit of land jutting out into the Salish Sea in Washington State, Tidepool Haven was a cluster of weathered cedar buildings – a main office, a quarantine zone, several large tanks for marine mammals, and a sprawling aviary. The constant lap of waves against the rocky shore, punctuated by the screech of gulls, formed the soundtrack to Amelia’s life.

## The Opening:

Amelia Josephine Hawthorne hummed a tuneless melody as she navigated the narrow, barnacle-encrusted pathway leading to the aviary. Her rubber boots squelched softly with each step, a familiar rhythm against the backdrop of the roaring sea. Today, the sea lions were unusually rambunctious, their barks and bellows echoing across the cove. Usually, the boisterous calls didn't faze her. She'd been working at Tidepool Haven for five years, practically raised on the salty air and the eccentric personalities of its inhabitants. But today, a prickle of unease settled at the back of her neck, a feeling as persistent and unwelcome as the persistent drizzle that threatened to seep through her worn oilskins. She stopped for a moment, inhaling deeply, trying to discern if the heightened commotion was simply a byproduct of the incoming tide, or something more sinister. The metallic tang of iron in the air, a smell usually associated with a pending storm, lingered faintly on her tongue. Dismissing it as an overactive imagination, Amelia tugged her woolen hat further down her brow and pushed open the heavy, reinforced door to the aviary. Inside, a cacophony of avian chatter erupted, momentarily drowning out the sea's roar. And then, she saw it. Or rather, *him*.
