Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a drafting worker:

**Setting:**

The year is 1958. The setting is a bustling drafting office on the 6th floor of the "Champion Steel" building, located in the heart of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The office is a symphony of muted sounds: the rhythmic scratching of pencils on vellum, the muffled chatter of engineers discussing blueprints, the clatter of a distant typewriter, and the ever-present hum of fluorescent lights. Rows of drafting tables, each illuminated by an adjustable lamp, dominate the space. Overflowing ashtrays sit precariously on the edges of the tables, a testament to the constant pressure and long hours. Walls are adorned with faded technical drawings, schematics, and motivational posters featuring slogans like "Accuracy is Everything" and "Build the Future." The air hangs thick with the scent of paper, ink, and stale cigarette smoke.

**Story Opening:**

Sweat beaded on Eleanor "Ellie" Mae Thompson's forehead as she meticulously traced the blueprints for a new bridge abutment. The Pennsylvania humidity clung to everything, seeping into the very fibres of her drafting vellum and making the ink run just a hair. Ellie pressed harder, her brow furrowed in concentration. It was Friday, almost 5 PM, and the entire office was buzzing with anticipation of the weekend. Everyone but her. Mr. Henderson, the head engineer, had dropped the abutment schematics on her table just this morning, murmuring something about "urgent deadlines" and "Eleanor's keen eye."

Ellie’s "keen eye" was, in reality, the only thing that kept her from losing her mind in this place. It wasn’t that she didn’t love drafting, but she dreamt of *designing*. Of creating. Not just copying the same damn I-beams and angles day after day.

A shadow fell across her table, and Ellie looked up to see Mr. Henderson himself, his face a tight mask of impatience. "Thompson," he said, his voice raspy, "how's she coming?"
