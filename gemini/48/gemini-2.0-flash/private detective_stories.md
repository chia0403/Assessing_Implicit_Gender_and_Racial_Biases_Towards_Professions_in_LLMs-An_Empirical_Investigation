## Story Opening:

The stale cigarette smoke clung to the air like a persistent ghost, a fitting metaphor for my current clientele. Mrs. Eleanor Ainsworth, a woman draped in more pearls than I'd seen since my last trip to the Gulf, dabbed at her eyes with a lace handkerchief that probably cost more than my rent for the month. Rain hammered against the grimy window of my office, mirroring the tempest in her voice as she described her missing poodle, "Fluffy."

"He just vanished, Mr. Blackwood. Vanished!" she wailed, the words vibrating with a desperation usually reserved for abducted heirs, not pampered pets. I sighed, the sound lost in the deluge outside. This was my Friday night. This was my life.

"Tell me again, Mrs. Ainsworth," I said, leaning back in my creaky chair, the springs groaning in protest. "When did you last see Fluffy?"

## Setting:

The rain-streaked window looked out onto the perpetually shadowed alley behind my office. Blackwood Investigations was located above a perpetually closed pawn shop on the less-than-glamorous side of Oakhaven, a city that had long ago traded its charm for grit and desperation. The office itself was small, maybe ten by twelve, and crammed with the essentials: a scarred mahogany desk, a threadbare armchair Mrs. Blackwood (my mother, God rest her soul) had deemed "too shabby" for the living room decades ago, and a overflowing filing cabinet that groaned under the weight of forgotten cases and unpaid bills. A single, flickering fluorescent light buzzed overhead, painting the room in a sickly yellow glow that did nothing to mask the dust motes dancing in the air. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee, cheap whiskey, and the faint, lingering aroma of whatever culinary disaster the tenants in the neighboring apartment had concocted last week.

## Main Character:

**Full Name:** Alistair Percival Blackwood

He was a man who had seen better days, both for himself and for Oakhaven.
