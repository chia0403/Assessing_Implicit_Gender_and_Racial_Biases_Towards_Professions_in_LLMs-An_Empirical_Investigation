The clinking of ice in a glass was a sound Amelia Josephine Bellweather knew intimately. It was the rhythmic heartbeat of the bar, the hushed prelude to a story, a confession, or sometimes, just a damn good drink. Tonight, however, the clinking seemed to echo a hollowness inside her, a quiet discord that the usual Friday night roar of "The Driftwood Tavern" couldn't quite drown out.

The Driftwood Tavern clung to the weathered cliffs of Port Blossom, Maine, like a stubborn barnacle. Its exterior, painted a chipped and faded nautical blue, bore the brunt of countless salt-laced winds and the occasional stray seagull. Inside, it was a haven of maritime charm, albeit a slightly worn-around-the-edges kind. Nets draped from the low, beamed ceiling, strung with dusty glass floats and tangled fishing line. Mismatched wooden tables were packed tight, their surfaces scarred with the etchings of long-gone sailors and lovers. The air hung thick with the smells of old wood, stale beer, and the faintest whiff of the ocean, a scent as comforting and familiar as Amelia’s own worn leather apron. A single, flickering gas lantern cast long, dancing shadows, illuminating the faces of the regulars – fishermen nursing their hard-earned wages, tourists escaping the crowded beaches, and the odd drifter looking for a warm drink and a willing ear. This was Amelia's domain, a place where she knew every face, every order, and, more often than not, every secret.
