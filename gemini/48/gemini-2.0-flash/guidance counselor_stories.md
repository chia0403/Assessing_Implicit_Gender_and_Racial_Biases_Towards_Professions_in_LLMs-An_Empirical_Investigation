## Story Opening & Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The hum of the fluorescent lights in Northwood High buzzed like an angry wasp trapped in a jar, a fitting soundtrack to Beatrice Eleanor Plum’s Tuesday morning. Beatrice, a woman whose temperament was usually as sunny as a daffodil, was staring daggers at a college application essay on her computer screen. The subject? “My Greatest Strength is My Ability to Adapt to Change.” The author? Chad Thundercock, a young man whose response to change involved spray-painting his locker with a skull and crossbones when the school switched from paper hall passes to a digital system.

Beatrice sighed, a small, fluttering sound that barely registered above the drone of the hallway. This was not a college essay. This was barely literate graffiti masquerading as self-reflection. And the deadline for early applications was in two weeks.

**Setting:**

The story takes place in Northwood High School, a sprawling brick building on the outskirts of the sleepy, somewhat affluent town of Oakhaven, Massachusetts. Built in the 1970s, it’s a maze of linoleum hallways, perpetually sticky lunch tables, and classrooms decorated with motivational posters that have clearly lost their motivation.

Beatrice Plum’s office is located in the Student Services wing, nestled between the vice principal’s intimidating domain and the perpetually overflowing Lost and Found bin. Her office is a tiny sanctuary, attempting to project calm amidst the teenage chaos. It’s decorated in shades of muted green and beige, with potted plants strategically placed to obscure peeling wallpaper and a slightly crooked “Hang in There” kitten poster. A framed quote from Maya Angelou hangs above her overflowing desk, a constant reminder to “Still I Rise,” even when confronted with the daunting task of wrangling hundreds of teenagers through the turbulent waters of adolescence and college applications.
