The scent of freshly sanded wood dust hung thick in the air, a stubborn perfume that clung to Amelia Rose Hawthorne like a second skin. It tickled her nose and clung to the elegant silk scarf she'd carelessly draped over the chair, a chair that currently sat upside down, awaiting its new life as the focal point of Mrs. Peabody's breakfast nook. Amelia loved this part of the job, the raw potential of a space before she coaxed it into something beautiful, something personal. She stood in the heart of the sun-drenched room, a cavernous space in what would soon be a sprawling Malibu estate, her chestnut hair pulled back in a messy bun, a smudge of charcoal on her cheek. The Pacific Ocean roared a constant, rhythmic hum outside the enormous, unglazed windows, a majestic soundtrack to the chaos of construction. This wasn't just a house; it was a blank canvas, and Amelia Hawthorne was the artist, charged with painting a life onto its empty walls.
