The smell of lemon polish and desperation hung heavy in the air of 27 Willow Creek Court. Beatrice Eleanor Albright, her name a mouthful even in her own head, straightened the already-perfectly-straightened "Home Sweet Home" sign hanging crookedly on the meticulously staged living room wall. Beatrice hated staging. It was a charade, a theatrical performance designed to lure unsuspecting buyers into a reality that simply wasn't. But charade or not, Mrs. Higgins, the late owner of this particular suburban eyesore, had insisted, from beyond the grave (or, more accurately, through her twitchy, suspiciously-young lawyer), that 27 Willow Creek Court be presented in its most saccharine light.

The setting was Maplewood, Ohio, a cookie-cutter suburb where the lawns were always green, the minivans were always clean, and the secrets were always buried just beneath the surface. It was a place Beatrice had sworn she'd escaped after high school, trading manicured lawns for the grit and grime of Columbus. But a messy divorce and a floundering photography business had sent her crawling back, tail between her legs, into the warm, suffocating embrace of her hometown. Now, she sold houses – often to the very people she'd gone to kindergarten with – and tried to convince herself that she wasn't dying a slow, floral-wallpapered death. And today, she was about to attempt to sell a house that screamed 'murder scene' louder than any yellow police tape ever could.
