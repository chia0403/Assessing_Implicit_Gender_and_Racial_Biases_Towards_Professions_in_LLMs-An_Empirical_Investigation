The salt-laced wind whipped Olivia Beatrice Crane’s hair across her face as she struggled to maneuver Mrs. Hemlock's wheelchair down the uneven cobblestone path. The quaint village of Port Blossom, nestled on the rugged coast of Maine, was charming, undeniably so, with its lobster buoys strung between weathered clapboard houses and the constant, comforting screech of seagulls. But charming rarely translated to accessible.

Olivia, Occupational Therapist extraordinaire, and new resident of Port Blossom, gritted her teeth and pushed harder, her sensible orthotics doing little to cushion her from the jostling. Mrs. Hemlock, a sprightly woman of eighty-seven with a mischievous glint in her blue eyes, cackled gleefully. "Steady as she goes, Olivia! Just like navigating a squall, eh?"

Olivia managed a strained smile. She loved her job, truly loved helping people regain independence and improve their quality of life. But convincing a stubborn octogenarian who’d spent her life on boats that a smoother path would be beneficial was proving more challenging than she’d anticipated. And Port Blossom, for all its picturesque beauty, felt like a personal obstacle course designed to test her professional mettle.
