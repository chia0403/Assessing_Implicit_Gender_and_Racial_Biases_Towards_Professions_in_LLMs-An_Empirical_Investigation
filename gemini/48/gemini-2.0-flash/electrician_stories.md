## Opening:

The fluorescent lights hummed a discordant tune, their sickly white glare reflecting off the puddles of condensation clinging to the rusted pipes overhead. Dust motes danced in the air, a slow, silent ballet in the oppressive humidity that hung thick in the abandoned textile mill. Elias Thorne, his brow furrowed in concentration, ran a calloused hand through his already disheveled hair. He swore under his breath. This wiring was a disaster, a chaotic tapestry of frayed ends, corroded copper, and the lingering scent of long-gone industry. He hadn't seen anything this bad since that old amusement park outside of Salem, and at least *that* had the charm of creepy carousels.

## Setting:

The year is 2042. Elias Thorne is working in the gutted remains of the "Cotton Blossom Textile Mill," a behemoth of brick and steel located on the outskirts of the derelict industrial city of Ashtown, Ohio. Ashtown was once a thriving hub for manufacturing, but decades of automation and outsourcing had left it a decaying husk, a breeding ground for urban legends and forgotten dreams. The Cotton Blossom, in particular, had been abandoned for almost forty years, its once-vibrant looms and spinning machines now rotting away in the dark, a stark testament to a bygone era. Elias had been contracted by a shadowy corporation called "New Eden Solutions" to rewire the entire building, ostensibly for a "sustainable agriculture research facility." But Elias had seen enough, heard enough rumors whispered in the dimly lit corners of Ashtown, to know there was more to it than just growing vegetables. This place felt wrong, a silent scream trapped within its brick walls, and Elias Thorne, electrician and reluctant truth-seeker, was walking right into its heart.
