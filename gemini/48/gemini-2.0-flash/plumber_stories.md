The rusty wrench slipped in Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins' grip, narrowly missing his toes. He cursed under his breath, a string of frustrated plumbing jargon that would make a sailor blush. Bart, a man built like a fire hydrant with a surprisingly gentle touch when it came to fragile pipes, was having a morning. And mornings in the Victorian terraced house on Grimshaw Street were never particularly easy.

The house itself, aptly named "Damp Hollow" by its previous (and presumably moisture-averse) owner, was a monument to neglect. Built in 1888, its brick facade was stained a perpetual mossy green, clinging desperately to the soot-laden air of Anytown, USA. The front porch sagged like a weary sigh, and the front door, painted a shade of sickly teal, peeled in angry strips, revealing glimpses of the dark wood beneath. Inside, the air hung thick and heavy, a humid blend of mildew, dust, and the faint, lingering aroma of boiled cabbage, a testament to the elderly Mrs. Gable, the current tenant, who had been residing there since before Bart was even a glint in his father's eye.

Bart was here, as he often was, answering Mrs. Gable's panicked cries about "the gurgling demon in the porcelain throne." He knew the "demon" was simply a corroded ballcock valve in the toilet, a familiar foe in the plumbing wars he waged daily against the city's aging infrastructure. But Mrs. Gable, bless her heart, saw it as a harbinger of doom, and Bart, a man who believed in the power of a good plunger and a friendly face, was happy to oblige her anxieties, for a reasonable fee, of course. The flickering gaslight in the hallway cast long, dancing shadows, adding an extra layer of gothic melodrama to Bart's already challenging workday. He tightened his grip on the wrench, took a deep breath, and prepared to descend into the watery abyss of the Damp Hollow bathroom once again.
