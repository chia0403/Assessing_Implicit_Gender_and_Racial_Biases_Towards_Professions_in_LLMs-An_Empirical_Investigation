## The Sun's Grin

The relentless Virginia sun beat down on Caleb Theodore Abernathyâ€™s back, staining his worn denim shirt a deep indigo. He squinted, the sweat stinging his eyes as he surveyed the endless rows of corn stretching towards the hazy horizon. The air hung thick and heavy, vibrating with the drone of cicadas, a relentless, droning soundtrack to his daily toil. This was Abernathy Farm, nestled in the heart of the Shenandoah Valley, a patchwork quilt of emerald fields and rust-colored barns, bounded by the jagged silhouette of the Blue Ridge Mountains in the distance. It had been in his family for generations, each Abernathy before him wrestling a living from this stubborn, beautiful land. Today, however, Caleb felt less like a steward and more like a gladiator, battling the heat and a creeping sense of unease. The crops were good, bountiful even, yet a disquieting silence clung to the air, a feeling that something wasn't quite right beneath the sun's grinning mask.
