The sterile hum of the Cavitron was a discordant counterpoint to the jazz streaming softly from the overhead speakers. Dr. Eleanor Vivian Thorne, D.D.S., meticulously scraped away a layer of calcified tartar from the lower incisors of Mr. Henderson, a man who, despite his age, still clung to his love of chewing tobacco.

Her office, Thorne Dental Wellness, occupied the second floor of a converted Victorian house on Elm Street, in the quaint, but increasingly gentrified, town of Willow Creek, Maine. Sunlight, filtered through the gauzy white curtains, cast long, ethereal shadows across the walls painted a calming shade of seafoam green. The room was meticulously organized, a testament to Eleanor’s methodical nature. Instruments gleamed in their sterilized trays, ready for her practiced hands. A small, framed print of a Klimt landscape hung above the patient chair, a splash of vibrant colour in the otherwise muted palette.

Outside, the murmur of Willow Creek life drifted up: the clatter of Mrs. Higgins’ pottery wheel at the studio next door, the distant chime of the ice cream truck, and the occasional laughter of children playing in the park across the street. It was a picture of idyllic normalcy, a stark contrast to the anxiety she often saw reflected in the wide, questioning eyes of her patients. And today, Eleanor sensed, something more than just dental anxiety was swirling around Mr. Henderson like the lingering scent of wintergreen mouthwash.
