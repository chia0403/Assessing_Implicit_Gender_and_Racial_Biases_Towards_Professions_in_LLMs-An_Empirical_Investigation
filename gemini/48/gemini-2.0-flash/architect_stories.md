## Story Opening & Setting

**Setting:** A biting November wind whipped off the East River, clawing at the glass and steel façade of the burgeoning Brooklyn Navy Yard. Dusk bled across the Manhattan skyline, turning the skyscrapers into jagged silhouettes against a bruised purple sky. The air, thick with the tang of salt and diesel, hinted at the coming winter. This was the crucible where old industry met new innovation, a place where the ghosts of shipbuilders and naval engineers still whispered amongst the modern workshops and tech startups.

**Story Opening:**

Alexandra Marguerite Dubois stared out the floor-to-ceiling window, her breath fogging a small circle in the cool glass. The city lights twinkled back at her, a seductive promise of beauty and opportunity, a promise that felt increasingly hollow these days. She swirled the lukewarm coffee in her chipped ceramic mug, the brown liquid mirroring the melancholic mood that had clung to her like the damp November air. Below, the clang of metal and the muffled roar of machinery continued their relentless symphony, a soundtrack to her dwindling inspiration. "Just one more project," she muttered to herself, her voice barely audible above the rhythmic hum of the building’s ventilation system. "Just one more project and I’m out." The rendering of the proposed "Vertical Farm & Community Hub" mocked her from the glowing screen of her computer. Sleek lines, sustainable materials, and a promise of green vitality rising from the concrete jungle. It was supposed to be her masterpiece, a testament to her vision. But all she saw was a lifeless facade, a hollow echo of the architect she used to be.
