The rain was a relentless, drumming rhythm against the aged slate roof of the cottage, a soundtrack that perfectly mirrored the frustration churning inside Beatrice Eleanor Ainsworth. Nestled deep within the Cotswolds, in a village so quaint it felt like stepping into a postcard, Rose Cottage was supposed to be her sanctuary. A place to finally escape the suffocating demands of London, the relentless book tours, and the persistent fear of another debilitating bout of writer's block.

The setting was undeniably idyllic. Outside, beyond the rain-streaked windows, rolling green hills dipped and soared, dotted with grazing sheep that seemed oblivious to the downpour. Wisteria, now heavy with water droplets, clung to the cottage walls, its delicate purple blooms a vibrant contrast against the weathered stone. Inside, a fire crackled merrily in the hearth, casting flickering shadows across the cluttered room.

But none of it mattered. Beatrice stared at the blank page in her antique typewriter, the keys cold and unforgiving beneath her trembling fingers. The story, the one that was supposed to be her masterpiece, a historical fiction epic about a forgotten queen, remained stubbornly locked away, just out of reach. Weeks had bled into months, and all she had to show for it was a growing mountain of crumpled paper and a deepening sense of despair.
