Okay, here's a story opening and setting:

**Setting:** The story opens in the bustling, humid heat of Everglades City, Florida. Mangrove roots tangle like gnarled fingers in the brackish water that edges the town.  The air smells of salt, decaying vegetation, and the faint, metallic tang of fish guts – a constant aroma in this small, fishing-centric community.  The main street, Collier Avenue, is lined with brightly painted, stilted buildings housing fishing tackle shops, bait and tackle stores, and weathered clapboard restaurants that serve up alligator nuggets and stone crab claws.  Just outside of town, the sawgrass prairies stretch as far as the eye can see, punctuated by isolated hammocks of cypress and cabbage palms.

**Opening:**

Dr. Amelia Willow Creek, DVM, stared at the x-ray glowing on the lightbox.  She took a long, slow sip of her lukewarm coffee – the kind that tasted faintly of yesterday's tuna sandwich from being left out too long in the Florida heat.  Outside, the drone of an airboat ripped through the still morning air, a common sound in Everglades City, but it still grated on her nerves this early.

The x-ray itself was the problem.  A juvenile Burmese python, about six feet long, lay on the metal examination table in the next room, sedated but still capable of a nasty bite.  And lodged squarely in its digestive tract, according to the image, was something distinctly...unnatural.  Definitely not a rat, not a rabbit, not even a particularly large iguana, all common prey for the invasive species.

"Well," Amelia murmured to herself, tapping a fingernail against the glowing film, "this is just great. Another Monday in paradise." She pinched the bridge of her nose, the scent of disinfectant clinging to her fingers. Dealing with sick iguanas or rescuing stranded manatees was one thing. Extracting whatever *that* was from a snake that should be feasting on native wildlife was starting to feel like a job she was wholly unprepared for, despite her years of experience. It looked suspiciously like a golf ball… embedded in a surprisingly pristine condition. And that raised far more questions than it answered.
