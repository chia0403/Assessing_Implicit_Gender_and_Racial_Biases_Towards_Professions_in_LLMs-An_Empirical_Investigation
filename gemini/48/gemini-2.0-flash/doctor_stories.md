Okay, here's a story opening with a doctor as the main character, incorporating setting and some initial conflict:

**Story Opening:**

The biting wind whipped off the Moray Firth, finding its way under Dr. Elara Thistlewood's thick wool coat and stinging her cheeks. The salt spray from the angry waves crashing against the harbor wall misted her glasses, blurring the already hazy twilight. She squinted, the skeletal silhouettes of fishing boats bobbing wildly in the turbulent water. Buckie, a small, hardscrabble town clinging to the Scottish coast, rarely saw weather this fierce in early November. The sky, a bruised purple and grey, threatened more.

Elara hurried along the cobbled street, her boots clacking against the uneven surface, the rhythmic sound almost drowned out by the howl of the gale. The faint glow emanating from the window of 'The Sea Serpent' pub was her only beacon. She was already ten minutes late, a cardinal sin in a town where gossip travelled faster than the fishing boats.

Inside, the air was thick with the smells of peat smoke, damp wool, and something vaguely fishy that Elara suspected was permanently embedded in the very fabric of the building. A hush fell over the room as she entered. Five pairs of eyes, weathered and wary, turned to her. Among them were a few of the town's oldest fishermen, nursing pints of dark ale. Sitting apart from them, a young woman with tears streaming down her face was speaking to the town's local law enforcement officer. This wasn't a casual social gathering; something had happened. And judging by the look on Constable MacLeod's face, it wasn't good.
