The rain hammered against the leaded glass windows of Professor Eleanor Ainsworth’s study, a relentless percussion that seemed to mock her fruitless attempts at deciphering the inscription. Outside, the moors of North Yorkshire stretched, a dark and brooding expanse barely visible through the swirling mist. The wind, a banshee howl she knew all too well, rattled the ancient stones of Ainsworth Manor, the ancestral home that had been in her family for generations.

Eleanor, a woman with a sharp intellect and even sharper wit, was hunched over a timeworn oak desk, its surface cluttered with parchment scrolls, leather-bound tomes, and the remnants of a hastily consumed cup of tea. Her silver-streaked auburn hair was pulled back in a severe bun, doing little to soften the angles of her face, which was currently etched with frustration. She pushed her spectacles higher on her nose, peering intently at the intricate carvings on the small, obsidian box that sat before her. This box, unearthed during the latest archaeological dig she'd been overseeing, held the key – or at least, she desperately hoped it did – to understanding the local legends of the Old Gods and the secrets buried deep within the unforgiving earth of Yorkshire. And right now, the rain seemed to be laughing at her, a damp and echoing reminder of her lack of progress.
