Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a main character who is a groundskeeper:

**Setting:**

The story opens on a brisk autumn morning at Blackwood Manor, a sprawling estate nestled deep within the verdant, but increasingly melancholy, hills of upstate New York. The Manor itself is a gothic masterpiece, all grey stone and imposing turrets, its grandeur softened by the encroaching ivy that clings to its walls like a lover's embrace. Ancient oaks and maples, their leaves ablaze in hues of crimson and gold, stand sentinel around the property, creating a cathedral of color that is both beautiful and slightly ominous. The air is crisp and carries the scent of damp earth, woodsmoke (drifting from the Manor’s chimneys), and the faint, lingering fragrance of decaying leaves. A thick fog, clinging to the valleys below, slowly begins to burn off as the sun climbs higher, revealing meticulously manicured lawns, formal gardens starting to succumb to winter's touch, and winding gravel paths that disappear into the woods.

**Story Opening:**

The first clanging ring of the old iron bell on the stable clock tower reverberated through the misty morning, a sound that usually roused only the horses and the sleepy staff inside Blackwood Manor. But for Bartholomew Ignatius Finch, it was a signal. He'd been awake for hours, a thermos of strong, black coffee clutched in his gloved hands, as he meticulously raked leaves from the rose garden.

Bartholomew, or Bart as he preferred, was the groundskeeper. He'd inherited the position, and the small cottage on the edge of the property, from his father, and his grandfather before him. He knew every inch of Blackwood Manor's grounds – the precise location of the most stubborn dandelions, the sweet spot where the hydrangeas thrived, and the hidden patch of wild blueberries that only bore fruit after a particularly harsh winter. He loved the land, he understood it, and he felt a deep connection to its history, a history older and darker than the Blackwood family themselves. Today, however, that history felt particularly heavy.

The bell's second ring echoed, a discordant note in the crisp air. It was then Bart noticed the front door of the manor was opened slightly. This was odd; it was never opened unless staff was actively cleaning or entering the space. "Probably just Mrs. Blackwood," he muttered to himself, referring to the current matriarch of the family, an eccentric woman known for her early morning ramblings. But as he watched, a figure emerged from the doorway, and his gut told him that something was not right. It was not Mrs. Blackwood, nor any of the staff; it was a tall, thin man he didn't recognize, who appeared to be sneaking away, and he glanced back over his shoulder as if to see if he was being followed. It was then that Bart knew, with a sudden certainty that chilled him deeper than the morning fog, that his quiet routine was about to be irrevocably disrupted. He set down his rake, his coffee now forgotten, and began to make his way to the back of the manor.
