Dust motes danced in the stale air, illuminated by the glow of three computer screens displaying a dizzying array of forms, schedules, and regulations.

Beatrice Eleanor Cavendish, income tax preparer extraordinaire (or at least, that's what she told herself on particularly brutal days), sighed inwardly. Another afternoon, another tale of woe disguised as Schedule C deduction advice. Beatrice, armed with her trusty calculator, her half-empty mug of lukewarm coffee, and the unwavering belief that she could find at least *some* deduction for Mrs. Higgins' prodigious zucchini, plastered on her most empathetic smile.
