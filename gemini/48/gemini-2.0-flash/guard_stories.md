## Opening:

The insistent clang of the watchtower bell cut through the predawn chill, a dissonant symphony that always tasted of fear. Sergeant Elara Vesper woke with a jolt, the coarse wool blanket scratching against her skin. Her hand, instinctively reaching for the sword hilt she kept under her pillow, found only air. Damn the recruits on night duty. Either a goblin had pinched a chicken, or Old Man Hemlock was mistaking a particularly robust sneeze for a warhorn again. With a groan that echoed the rusty hinges of her cot, Elara hauled herself upright.

## Setting:

The town of Oakhaven nestled in the valley of the Whispering Woods, a place of both enchanting beauty and gnawing unease. Three walls, constructed from the dense, greystone found in the nearby mountains, defended the town from the dangers lurking beyond the treeline: goblins, wild beasts, and the occasional bandit raiding party. Elara Vesper’s post was the East Gate, a heavy wooden structure reinforced with iron bands and perpetually damp from the morning mist that snaked through the valley. The air, even in the brightest midday, always held a hint of damp earth and the decaying scent of pine needles. On a clear day, from the watchtower above the gate, one could see the jagged peaks of the Dragon’s Teeth mountains in the distance, a constant reminder of the wild, untamed lands that pressed in on all sides. Within the walls, Oakhaven was a patchwork of cobbled streets, thatched-roofed cottages, and the lively bustle of a small farming community. But even here, under the illusion of safety, the shadow of the forest loomed large.
