Okay, here's a story opening with the details you requested:

**Story Opening:**

The dust swirled, coating Elias Thorne in a fine, grey film that highlighted the deepening lines etched around his eyes. He coughed, spitting out the grit. The late afternoon sun, bleeding crimson onto the jagged peaks of the Whisperwind Mountains, did little to soften the harsh landscape of the quarry. Another day, another block wrestled from the belly of the earth.

Elias knelt, his worn leather gloves protecting his hands as he ran a calloused thumb over the newly exposed surface of the granite. A flicker of something, a subtle shift in the grain, caught his eye. He leaned closer, his breath misting in the cooling air. This wasn't ordinary granite. This, he suspected, held a story. A long one. And Elias, stone cutter, was about to become its reluctant reader.

**Setting:**

The story is set in a rugged, mountainous region called the Whisperwind Mountains. Specifically, it begins at a granite quarry nestled high in the foothills. The quarry is a harsh and unforgiving place, characterized by:

*   **Grey and desolate landscape:** Dominated by grey rock and scattered patches of scrubby vegetation.
*   **The towering Whisperwind Mountains:** Provide a dramatic backdrop, their jagged peaks perpetually capped with snow. The wind, constantly whistling through the mountains, gives them their name.
*   **A small, isolated community:** The quarry workers and their families live in a cluster of rough-hewn cabins nearby, dependent on the quarry for their livelihood. Life is hard, and resources are scarce.
*   **A sense of ancient history:** The mountains themselves feel old, as if they hold secrets buried deep within their stone. The quarry has been in operation for generations, adding to the feeling of a place steeped in time.
*   **End of summer/beginning of fall:** the weather is starting to turn, the days are growing shorter, and there's a distinct chill in the air, foreshadowing the harsh winter to come.
