**Opening:**

The siren's wail tore through the pre-dawn stillness like a jagged knife. A jolt of adrenaline snapped Captain Emilia “Emmy” Rossi awake. She was already halfway out of bed before the tinny dispatcher's voice crackled over the speaker, spitting out a warehouse fire, three blocks east of the station. Emmy swore under her breath. Three blocks. Close enough to be dangerous, close enough to be personal.

**Setting:**

The story is set in the bustling, industrial port city of Veridia, situated on the edge of a tempestuous, gray-blue ocean. Veridia is a city of contrasts: sleek skyscrapers shadow crumbling brick warehouses, and the salty tang of the sea clashes with the acrid fumes of industry. The fire station, Engine 24, is nestled in a gritty district bordering the docks. It's a two-story brick building, its red paint chipped and faded, the clang of the garage door a familiar soundtrack to the neighborhood. Inside, the station is a chaotic symphony of well-worn gear, clanging weights in the gym, and the ever-present aroma of coffee, strong enough to jump-start a dead man. Outside, the streets are a labyrinth of loading bays, greasy diners, and warehouses that seem to breathe rust and forgotten dreams.
