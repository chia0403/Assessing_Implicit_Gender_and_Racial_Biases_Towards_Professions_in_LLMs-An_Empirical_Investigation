The biting wind ripped through the Doug firs, a mournful whistle that matched the ache in Jebediah Silas's bad knee. He’d been chasing this specific tree for three days now, a behemoth of old growth that stood silhouetted against the bruised purple of the Montana sky. The snow, crisp and unforgiving, crunched under his worn logger boots as he circled the giant, his breath clouding in the frigid air. Jebediah Silas, at fifty-three a veteran of these unforgiving forests, felt the familiar mixture of respect and greed swirling within him. Respect for the ancient power radiating from the tree, greed for the payday it represented.

The setting was a remote section of the Kootenai National Forest, a place locals referred to as “Whispering Ridge.” Towering evergreens, some centuries old, carpeted the steep slopes, their branches heavy with snow. Patches of exposed granite peeked through the white, treacherous and slick. The air was thin, the silence broken only by the creaking of the trees and the occasional call of a raven. Jebediah Silas, bundled in layers of flannel and Carhartt, stood in his element, a solitary figure against the vast, indifferent landscape, his chainsaw glinting ominously in the fading light.
