Okay, here’s a story opening and setting featuring a concierge named Evander Hawthorne:

**Setting:**

The Grand Zenith Hotel, nestled in the heart of Vienna's Innere Stadt. Imagine a symphony of Old World charm and modern luxury. Crystal chandeliers cascade light onto marble floors polished to a mirror sheen. The air hums with the hushed tones of multilingual conversations and the gentle tinkling of a grand piano from the adjacent lounge. Intricate floral arrangements, bursting with vibrant orchids and fragrant roses, adorn every surface. Uniformed staff glide through the lobby with effortless grace, anticipating every guest's need before it's even spoken. The Grand Zenith is not merely a hotel; it's a living, breathing monument to refined hospitality.

**Opening:**

Evander Hawthorne, his name as ornate as the gold leaf edging the Zenith’s registration desk, adjusted his tie. It was precisely three minutes past seven in the morning, and the first wave of early risers – hurried businessmen, bleary-eyed tourists chasing the sunrise, and the occasional secretive rendezvous – was about to crash upon the shore of his concierge desk. He'd already reviewed the day's arrivals, flagging the VIPs, noting the dietary restrictions, and mentally prepping himself for the inevitable barrage of requests: concert tickets, private tours, recommendations for the *best* sachertorte (everyone, it seemed, had a different opinion), and occasionally, far more… delicate… arrangements. The Zenith was a stage, and Evander, with his encyclopedic knowledge and unflappable demeanor, was the seasoned stage manager, ensuring every performance, no matter how grand or mundane, went off without a hitch. But this morning, there was an unusual tension prickling at the back of his neck, a discordant note in the Zenith's usual harmony. The source? A single, unopened envelope, slipped anonymously into his mailbox the previous evening, its thick, creamy paper radiating an unsettling aura of secrets. He knew, with a certainty that chilled him to the bone, that his day, and perhaps much more, was about to become considerably more complicated.
