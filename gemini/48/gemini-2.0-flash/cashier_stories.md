The harsh fluorescent lights of the Quick Stop mart buzzed overhead, a soundtrack to Amelia Marie Rodriguez's existential dread. It wasn't the end of the world, not really. It was just another Tuesday night, 9:17 PM according to the dusty clock above the cigarette rack, and another parade of characters was shuffling through her line. She sighed, the exhalation barely audible over the rhythmic beep of the scanner. Another bag of chips, another pack of gum, another lottery ticket chasing a pipe dream. This was her life, or at least, it felt like it had been for the last eternity.

The Quick Stop sat on the corner of Elm and Maple, a beacon of questionable sustenance and late-night desperation in the sleepy, suburban town of Willow Creek. The asphalt of the parking lot was cracked and faded, littered with stray cigarette butts and the occasional runaway shopping cart. Inside, the linoleum floor was sticky with spilled soda, the air thick with the scent of stale coffee and microwaved burritos. A single, potted plant – a sad, anemic fern – sat precariously on the counter, a valiant but ultimately futile attempt to inject some life into the sterile environment. This was Amelia's domain, her purgatory, the place where dreams came to die slow, agonizing deaths, one transaction at a time.
