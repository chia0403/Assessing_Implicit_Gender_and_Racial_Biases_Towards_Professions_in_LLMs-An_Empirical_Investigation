Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a tailor character:

**Setting:** The bustling marketplace of Polderveld, a city carved into the side of a steep mountain in the Kingdom of Aethelgard. Think vibrant colors, mismatched architecture clinging to the cliff face, and the constant echo of bartering in a dozen different dialects. The air is thick with the smell of roasting meats, spices, and the faint, ever-present aroma of mountain wildflowers clinging to the stone.

**Opening:**

The sharp click of shears was a familiar melody in the chaotic symphony of Polderveld marketplace. Elias Thorne, his brow furrowed in concentration, traced the edge of a fine bolt of midnight-blue velvet.  Sunlight, filtered through the awning of his small stall, warmed the back of his neck, but did little to soothe the gnawing anxiety that had settled in his gut.  Another day, another mountain of mending requests, and still no sign of his apprentice, Pipkin.  Elias sighed, pushing his spectacles further up his nose. If Pipkin hadn’t returned by midday, he’d have to venture out into the market himself, and Elias Thorne, master tailor, had about as much love for haggling as he did for tangled thread.
