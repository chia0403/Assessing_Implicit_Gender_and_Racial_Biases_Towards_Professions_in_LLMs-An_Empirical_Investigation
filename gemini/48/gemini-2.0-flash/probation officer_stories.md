## Story Opening & Setting:

**Opening:**

The stale air of the Breakstone County Probation Department hung thick with the ghosts of broken promises and second chances. Amelia Rose Davies, Probation Officer II, pinched the bridge of her nose, the fluorescent lights above threatening to ignite a migraine behind her left eye. She stared at the crumpled intake form in front of her, the stark black ink a stark contrast to the anemic beige of the paper. "Jameson, Ethan," it read, followed by a litany of charges that painted a portrait of youthful recklessness spiraling dangerously out of control: DUI, resisting arrest, minor possession. Just another Tuesday, she thought, sighing. But something in the tremor in his arresting officer's signature on the form gave her a prickling unease. This one felt different.

**Setting:**

The Breakstone County Probation Department occupied a low-slung, brick building on the outskirts of the county seat, Havenwood. Built in the 1970s, it felt perpetually stuck in that era, from the wood-paneled walls and utilitarian furniture to the clack of aging typewriters that still echoed from the secretaries' pool. Sunlight, when it dared to penetrate the grime-streaked windows, illuminated dust motes dancing in the air, creating an almost ethereal, melancholic atmosphere. The surrounding landscape was a mixture of struggling strip malls, decaying factories, and pockets of quiet residential neighborhoods, a microcosm of the societal fractures that Amelia battled every day within those walls. The scent of cheap coffee, disinfectant, and simmering anxieties permeated the air, a potent cocktail that clung to Amelia's clothes and followed her home each evening.
