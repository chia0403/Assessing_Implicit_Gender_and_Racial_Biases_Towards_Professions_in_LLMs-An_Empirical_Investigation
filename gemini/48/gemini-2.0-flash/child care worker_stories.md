## Story Opening:

The rhythmic squeak of the rocking horse was driving Eleanor Rose Finch absolutely insane. Usually, she found the sound soothing, a white noise companion to the chaos that permeated the Bright Beginnings Daycare every afternoon. But today, it was grating on her nerves like fingernails on a chalkboard.

Eleanor sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair out of her eyes, hair that had escaped the messy bun she'd haphazardly thrown it into hours ago. Sweat prickled her forehead. It was a particularly humid August afternoon, and the ancient window unit in the "Ducklings" room, meant for children aged two to three, was doing a valiant but ultimately losing battle against the heat. She could feel the sticky film of sweat clinging to her skin, a perfect breeding ground for rogue glitter from yesterday's craft project.

**Setting:**

Bright Beginnings Daycare was located in a converted Victorian house on a quiet, tree-lined street in the small town of Willow Creek, Pennsylvania. The house had seen better days; paint peeled in cheerful but undeniably dilapidated layers from the porch swing, and the brightly colored plastic toys scattered across the lawn looked faded and sun-bleached. Inside, however, Eleanor and the other staff did their best to create a welcoming and stimulating environment.

The "Ducklings" room, where Eleanor spent most of her days, was painted a cheerful, if slightly overwhelming, shade of daffodil yellow. Pictures of farm animals and alphabet posters adorned the walls, competing for space with artwork created by the children themselves. The room was filled with the usual paraphernalia of toddlerhood: a small table surrounded by miniature chairs, a sprawling rug covered in building blocks, a toy kitchen filled with plastic food, and of course, the infernal rocking horse. Despite the best efforts of the cleaning lady, a thin layer of glitter seemed permanently embedded in the floorboards, a testament to the sheer joy – and mess – of early childhood.
