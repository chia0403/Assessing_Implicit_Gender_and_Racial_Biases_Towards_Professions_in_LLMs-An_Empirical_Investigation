## Story Opening:

The smell of hot asphalt clung to Jedediah Bartholomew’s clothes like a stubborn, unwanted guest. He inhaled deeply, a habit born from fifteen years of breathing in the potent, acrid fumes. It was a smell that meant hard work, long days, and, ultimately, a steady paycheck. Today, however, the smell was tinged with a nervous edge. The air hung thick and heavy, not just with asphalt, but with an unspoken tension that prickled the back of Jedediah's neck. He glanced up at the looming grey sky, already pregnant with rain, and wiped a smear of grit from his brow with the back of his gloved hand. Today felt… different.

## Setting:

The year is 1978. Jedediah and his crew are working on a particularly desolate stretch of Highway 50, known locally as "The Loneliest Road in America," in the heart of Nevada. The landscape is a stark canvas of browns and greys: scrub brush clinging desperately to life on rocky hillsides, the shimmering heat haze distorting the distant mountains into ethereal, jagged shapes, and the relentless, unforgiving asphalt stretching out in a perfectly straight line towards the horizon. The nearest town, a dusty, forgotten place called Eureka, is a good fifty miles away. The only sounds are the rumble of the asphalt paver, the insistent drone of cicadas, and the occasional, mournful whistle of a distant train, a reminder of the vast emptiness surrounding them. They’re laying down a fresh layer of asphalt on the westbound lane, battling the relentless sun and the eerie silence that seems to amplify every clang of metal and shouted command. The crew, a motley bunch of weathered men, move with a practiced efficiency, their faces etched with the weariness of the road and the resilience of those who make their living battling the elements.
