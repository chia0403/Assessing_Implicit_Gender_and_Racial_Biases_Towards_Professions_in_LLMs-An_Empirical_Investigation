The scent of old leather and desperation hung heavy in the air of Elias Thorne's office, a smell he knew intimately. Sunlight, filtered through the grime-streaked windows of the Bradbury Building, cast long, skeletal shadows across the room, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. Elias, a man perpetually teetering on the edge of rumpled elegance, sat hunched over a precariously stacked pile of case files, his tie loosened and his sleeves rolled up. He ran a hand through his thinning, salt-and-pepper hair, leaving it even more dishevelled than before.

Elias Thorne, Esq., was a lawyer who specialised in taking the cases no one else wanted. The lost causes. The forgotten people. His office, a relic of a bygone era nestled amongst the gleaming skyscrapers of downtown Los Angeles, reflected that ethos perfectly. It was a bastion of faded glory, a testament to the belief that everyone, no matter how small or seemingly insignificant, deserved their day in court. Outside, the roar of the city pressed in, a constant reminder of the forces at play, the powerful engines of wealth and influence that often crushed the vulnerable beneath their weight. Inside, Elias offered a refuge, a sliver of hope carved out of the concrete jungle. Today, however, even that sliver felt impossibly narrow.
