The chipped, fluorescent lights of the Metropolitan Museum of Art hummed a discordant symphony, a stark contrast to the silent, still grandeur that surrounded Elias Thorne. The dust motes danced in the weak glow, swirling like tiny, rebellious ballerinas. He wasn't supposed to be here yet; the last of the docents were usually shooing out lingering tourists, their hushed whispers fading into the thick, ancient air. But tonight, the museum held its breath, waiting.

Elias, full name Elias Theodore Thorne, didn't mind the early start. Truth be told, he preferred the museum this way, emptied of its chattering throng, bathed in the pale, pre-dawn light. In these quiet hours, the artworks seemed to relax, to exhale the centuries of stories they held within their frames and sculpted forms. He was just a janitor, but he felt like a confidante, privy to secrets the elite could only glimpse from a distance. Tonight, however, there was a different tension in the air, a feeling that prickled at the back of his neck like static electricity. He clutched his worn-out mop a little tighter and began his patrol, starting with the Egyptian wing.
