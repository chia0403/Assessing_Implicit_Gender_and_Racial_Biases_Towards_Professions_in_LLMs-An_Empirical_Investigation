The sterile scent of fluoride and cinnamon assaulted Eleanor Beatrice Davies the moment she unlocked the door to "SmileBright Dental." Tuesday mornings were always a little rough, even after fifteen years of scraping plaque and polishing enamel. The soft, pre-dawn light barely filtered through the blinds of the waiting room, casting long shadows on the pastel-colored armchairs and the motivational posters proclaiming the power of a perfect smile. Dust motes danced in the air, disturbed by Eleanor's entrance, a tiny, silent ballet of grit and grime she would soon banish with her meticulous cleaning routine. Outside, the rain was falling in sheets, drumming a steady rhythm against the windowpane, a melancholic soundtrack to the start of another day in Willow Creek, Oregon - a town known less for its vibrant smiles and more for its persistent drizzle.
