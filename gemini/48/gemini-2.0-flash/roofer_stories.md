Okay, here's a story opening and setting, including the full name of the main character, a roofer:

**Story Opening & Setting:**

The sun beat down on Edgar Percival Finch's neck, a relentless, unforgiving assault that made the sweat gather in the small of his back, plastering his blue work shirt to his skin. He squinted, the glare reflecting blindingly off the brand new, still-oily, asphalt shingles he was wrestling into place. The rhythmic *thwack-thwack-thwack* of his hammer punctuated the oppressive afternoon silence, a sound Edgar had come to both loathe and rely on over the last twenty years.

Edgar took a swig from his lukewarm water bottle, the plastic crinkling in his calloused hand. He glanced out across the sprawling vista. He was high, *really* high, perched atop the newest McMansion sprouting like a particularly aggressive weed in the "Willow Creek Estates" development, just outside of the drowsy town of Havenwood, Iowa. From here, the world spread out in a patchwork quilt of emerald cornfields, silver silos, and neat little houses with perfectly manicured lawns. It was picture postcard Iowa, the kind of place Edgar had always dreamt of escaping, but ironically, had now found himself permanently stuck in. He spat a wad of dust and grit off the roof, watching it disappear into the shimmering heat haze below. Somewhere down there, probably listening to country radio and baking a casserole, was his wife, Darlene. He loved her, he really did, but sometimes he felt like he was as trapped as a shingle stuck fast to a roof, slowly baking in the sun until he cracked and crumbled. Today felt like one of those days. A day ripe for cracking.
