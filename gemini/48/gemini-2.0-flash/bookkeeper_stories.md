The fluorescent lights of the office hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Agnes Penelope Appleby's life. It was Tuesday, 2:17 PM, and the late afternoon sun, a watery lemon through the grime-streaked windows of "Bailey & Bumble, Importers of Fine Teas," cast long, melancholy shadows across Agnes' cluttered desk. Stacks of invoices, receipts, and ledger books threatened to topple at any moment, a paper Everest that Agnes had meticulously sculpted over the past twenty-three years. The air hung thick with the cloying sweetness of Darjeeling and the sharper tang of unfulfilled potential.

Bailey & Bumble's occupied the third floor of a crumbling Victorian building on Grantham Street, a forgotten corner of Leeds that still clung stubbornly to its industrial past. Outside, the rumble of delivery trucks and the clatter of machinery competed with the cries of seagulls, a surreal symphony only audible if you strained to hear it over the incessant drone of Agnes' adding machine. The building itself seemed to sigh with every gust of wind, a sigh Agnes understood all too well. She was, after all, just as stuck in the past, meticulously balancing the books of a company that had seen better days, a company that, much like herself, was slowly fading into the sepia-toned history of Grantham Street.
