Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a story featuring a movie director named, let's say, **Evelyn Rose Thatcher**:

**Setting:**

The Chateau Marmont, West Hollywood, California. A sweltering Tuesday afternoon in late August. The air, thick with the scent of jasmine and desperation, hung heavy around the Spanish-style courtyard. Palm trees, their fronds drooping in the heat, offered little solace from the relentless sun baking the faded pink stucco. The low hum of traffic on Sunset Boulevard provided a constant, almost subliminal, soundtrack to the scene.

**Opening:**

Evelyn Rose Thatcher hated meetings. She hated them with the burning passion of a thousand celluloid suns. And this one, poolside at the Chateau Marmont, with its attendant air of forced bonhomie and simmering ambition, was particularly odious. Evelyn, perched precariously on the edge of a wicker chair, shielded her eyes with oversized sunglasses. The glint of the swimming pool, a shimmering turquoise rectangle reflecting the relentless Californian sky, only amplified the throbbing behind her temples. She took a long, slow drag from her cigarette, the Marlboro Red a small act of rebellion against the healthy-living mantras constantly bombarding her in this town. "So," boomed the voice of Barry Lipschitz, the studio executive across from her, his face glistening with sunscreen and an almost manic energy. "Let's talk about the ending, Evelyn. We need more...oomph." Evelyn blew a plume of smoke towards a nearby potted hibiscus. Oomph. That was the word, wasn't it? The magical ingredient that separated box office gold from critical darlings that nobody actually saw. And Evelyn Rose Thatcher, for all her independent spirit and art-house sensibilities, desperately needed box office gold.
