The bleating siren, a banshee wail cutting through the humid Louisiana air, was almost a welcome sound. Almost. After twelve hours of wrangling a toddler who'd swallowed a handful of his grandmother's prescription pills, a biker who thought he was immune to pavement, and a woman convinced she was giving birth to an alien, even the incessant drone of an ambulance felt like a return to normalcy for Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Dubois.

She gripped the steering wheel of the ambulance, the call sheet flapping against the dashboard. "Disturbance at LaBelle Manor Assisted Living Facility. Possible altercation. Elderly resident involved." Lovely. Just what she needed. LaBelle Manor. The place was a haven for simmering resentments, half-remembered pasts, and more fragile bones than a chicken coop.

The setting sun cast long, distorted shadows across the Spanish moss hanging from the ancient oak trees lining the drive to LaBelle Manor. The building itself, a sprawling antebellum mansion stubbornly refusing to crumble, stood silhouetted against the fiery sky, its peeling paint a testament to faded grandeur. Crickets chirped a mournful chorus from the overgrown gardens, a sound that usually soothed Ellie, but tonight it only amplified the feeling of impending doom that settled in her stomach. As she pulled up to the front portico, already seeing the agitated face of Nurse Brenda peering through the leaded-glass windows, Ellie sighed. Another night, another crisis. And she, Dr. Eleanor Dubois, was the one about to walk into it.
