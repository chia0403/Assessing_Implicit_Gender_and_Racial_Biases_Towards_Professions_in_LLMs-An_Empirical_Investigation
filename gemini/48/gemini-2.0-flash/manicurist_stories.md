## Story Opening:

The rasp of the emery board was almost hypnotic, a constant whisper against the rhythmic thump of K-Pop bleeding from the salon speakers. Aurora Bellefleur, meticulously shaping a perfect oval on Mrs. Henderson's thumb, tried to block out the music and focus. Focus was key. One slip, one jagged edge, and Mrs. Henderson, with her pursed lips and steel-grey gaze, would be sure to let Aurora know. It wasn't that Aurora disliked her job, not really. There was a strange satisfaction in transforming dull, neglected nails into miniature works of art. It was the *pressure* that chipped away at her, like a badly applied topcoat. Pressure from Mrs. Henderson, pressure from the ticking clock, and most of all, pressure from the ever-present gnawing in her gut that told her she was wasting her time.

## Setting:

"Nail Nirvana" sat nestled in the heart of Maplewood, a sleepy suburb ten miles outside of bustling Chicago. The salon, owned by a perpetually stressed woman named Brenda with a penchant for animal prints, was a pastel pink explosion. Think flamingo wallpaper, plush purple seating that resembled melting ice cream, and enough sparkly nail polish to blind a small army. It catered to a clientele of mostly middle-aged women seeking escape from the drudgery of grocery shopping and PTA meetings. The air perpetually hung heavy with the scent of acetone, artificial cherry blossom, and the low hum of the nail dryers, a soundtrack to the quiet dramas that unfolded within its fluorescent-lit walls. A large plate glass window, framed by fluttering sheer curtains, looked out onto Maplewoodâ€™s main street, offering a glimpse of the mundane lives Aurora longed to leave behind.
