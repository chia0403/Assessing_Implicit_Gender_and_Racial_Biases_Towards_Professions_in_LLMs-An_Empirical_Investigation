The fluorescent lights of the St. Jude's Hospital cafeteria buzzed like angry bees trapped in a jar. Dr. Genevieve Beatrice Dubois sighed, pushing a lone green bean around her lukewarm "chef's special" of chicken-flavored soy protein and mashed potato flakes. It wasn't the food itself – though Lord knew it was barely passable – but the sheer, soul-crushing futility of it all that gnawed at her.

St. Jude's, nestled in the heart of gritty, forgotten South Philadelphia, was a battlefield. Not one fought with bullets or bombs, but with diabetes, hypertension, and the slow, creeping devastation of poverty and poor nutrition. Genevieve, a registered dietician with a Master's in Public Health and a heart full of naive idealism, had arrived fresh out of graduate school, ready to arm these patients with the knowledge to fight back.

Now, three years in, her idealism was bruised, battered, and clinging to life by a thread. She was surrounded by people struggling just to survive, let alone worry about glycemic index or recommended daily allowances. They ate what they could afford, what was readily available, what tasted good, which, in this part of town, rarely intersected with "nutritious." The hospital's budget for patient meals was a joke, and Genevieve spent most of her time trying to convince vendors to donate slightly less bruised apples or wilted heads of lettuce. Today, she was staring at the sad, beige reality of her efforts, wondering if she was making any difference at all. The setting sun cast long, somber shadows across the linoleum floor, mirroring the growing despair in her own heart.
