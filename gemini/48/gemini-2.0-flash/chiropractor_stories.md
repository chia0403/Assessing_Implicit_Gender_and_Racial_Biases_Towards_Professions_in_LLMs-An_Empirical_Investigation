## Opening & Setting:

The smell of eucalyptus and something vaguely medicinal, maybe liniment, hung thick in the air of Back in Balance Chiropractic Clinic. Outside, the relentless Miami sun hammered down on the palm-lined streets of Coral Gables, but inside, Dr. Eleanor Maeve Kensington had created a sanctuary of cool air and calming music.

Eleanor, a woman who looked more like a dancer than a doctor with her long, lean limbs and perpetually pulled-back auburn hair, adjusted the headrest of her chiropractic table. The white vinyl gleamed under the soft track lighting. This particular Thursday afternoon was proving to be a mix of familiar faces and new aches. Mrs. Rodriguez with her chronic lower back pain, Mr. Henderson nursing a golf-induced shoulder strain, and then... the unknown quantity waiting in the reception area. A figure shrouded in what Eleanor suspected was far too much black clothing for the Miami climate, their face obscured by oversized sunglasses. A potential mystery attached to a spine. Eleanor took a deep breath, straightened the embroidered nametag on her white coat – Dr. Eleanor Kensington, D.C. – and plastered on her most reassuring smile. She was ready for whatever walked through that door. After all, she was in the business of putting people back together, one vertebrae at a time.
