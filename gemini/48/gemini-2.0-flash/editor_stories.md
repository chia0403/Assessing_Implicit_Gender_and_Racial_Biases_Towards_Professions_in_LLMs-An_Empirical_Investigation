The stale air of the office clung to Margaret Eleanor Ainsworth like a second skin. It was the smell of deadlines missed, authors disappointed, and countless cups of lukewarm coffee gone cold. She hated it, but it was a familiar, comforting hate. Outside, the rain lashed against the grimy windows of the Sterling & Stone Publishing building, a relentless drumming that mirrored the frantic beat in her chest.

Margaret, Senior Editor, was hunched over a manuscript illuminated by the harsh glow of her desk lamp, the fluorescent hum a constant, irritating drone. The office itself was a study in organized chaos. Stacks of submissions threatened to topple over, forming precarious towers on every available surface. Post-it notes, each a tiny explosion of color, clung to her computer monitor, a kaleidoscope of revisions, queries, and gentle (or not-so-gentle) reminders. The walls, once a cheerful beige, were now stained with coffee rings and the faded ghosts of long-forgotten motivational posters. It was past midnight, but the city – or at least Margaret's little corner of it on the 17th floor of a Midtown Manhattan skyscraper – was still very much awake, humming with a restless energy that fueled her work. This was her world, a world of words, where she breathed life into stories, one semicolon at a time. And tonight, she had a feeling this particular story was about to give her a heart attack.
