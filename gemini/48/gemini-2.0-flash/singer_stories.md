The air in the dimly lit jazz club hung thick with the scent of stale beer and desperation, a perfume Beatrice "Bea" Moreau knew intimately. The chipped mahogany bar gleamed weakly under the single spotlight above, reflecting the anxious sweat on Bea's brow. She adjusted the microphone stand, the metal cold against her trembling fingers. Outside, the relentless Chicago wind howled a mournful tune, mimicking the dread churning in her stomach.

Bea had played dozens of dives worse than "The Blue Note" on South Clark Street, but tonight felt different. Tonight felt like a tightrope walk over a chasm of self-doubt, with her meager rent money serving as the pathetic safety net below. She'd been hustling gigs since she was sixteen, her voice the only thing separating her from the crushing poverty she'd grown up in. But recently, even that seemed to be faltering.

The crowd, a motley collection of lonely souls, weary workers, and tourists looking for a gritty Chicago experience, barely registered her presence. A clattering of glasses and murmured conversations filled the space, a symphony of indifference threatening to drown out the melody she was desperately trying to hold onto.
