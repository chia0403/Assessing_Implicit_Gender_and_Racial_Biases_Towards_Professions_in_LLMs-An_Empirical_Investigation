The humid Georgia air hung thick and heavy, a sweaty blanket clinging to everything and everyone. Thomas Ashton Riley, known as "Ash" to most, wiped a bead of perspiration from his brow with the back of his calloused hand, leaving a smear of dirt in its wake. He sighed, the sound lost in the whir of the gas-powered hedge trimmer he held aloft. He was knee-deep in a meticulously manicured rose garden at the Blackwood Plantation, the sprawling antebellum mansion a stark white contrast against the emerald green of the surrounding lawns and ancient oaks.

The Blackwood Plantation wasn't just any landscaping job; it was practically a living monument, steeped in history and dripping with old Southern money. Ash had been tending its grounds for three years now, a testament to his skill and dedication, but also to the owner's, Mrs. Magnolia Blackwood's, peculiar fondness for him. He suspected it had less to do with his landscaping prowess and more to do with the fact that his easygoing charm and genuine smile reminded her of a dearly departed grandson. Whatever the reason, it paid the bills, and kept him fed, and allowed him to indulge in his real passion - sculpting miniature bonsai trees in his tiny, cluttered garage apartment on the other side of Savannah. But right now, all he could think about was escaping the heat and the endless, thorny demands of Mrs. Blackwood's prize-winning roses.
