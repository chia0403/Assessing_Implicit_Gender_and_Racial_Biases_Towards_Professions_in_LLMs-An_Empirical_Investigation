The scent of lemon-scented cleaner and impending doom hung heavy in the air of the waiting room. Rain lashed against the plate glass window, blurring the already depressing view of a gray, industrial park across the street. Inside, the floral-patterned chairs were stiff, and the magazines – mostly outdated issues of "Better Homes & Gardens" and "National Geographic" – looked as though they’d witnessed too many tragedies. This was, after all, the office of Dr. Albright, the only physician in the tri-county area who specialized in back injuries and workman's compensation claims.

Sitting rigidly on the edge of one of those floral chairs was **Eleanor "Ellie" Ainsworth**, insurance agent extraordinaire for Midwest Mutual. She clutched her oversized, slightly worn leather briefcase to her chest like a shield. Inside were forms, policies, and printouts detailing the specifics of Mr. Reginald Humphrey’s rather unfortunate, and potentially very expensive, incident involving a runaway combine harvester and a field full of prize-winning pumpkins. Eleanor hated visiting doctors' offices, especially those specializing in the aftermath of farming accidents. The stories, the sheer physical weight of the injuries, always left her feeling inexplicably small and fragile. But she was nothing if not diligent. And today, she was on a mission to determine the extent of Mr. Humphrey's claim, and hopefully, just hopefully, prevent Midwest Mutual from being completely bled dry.
