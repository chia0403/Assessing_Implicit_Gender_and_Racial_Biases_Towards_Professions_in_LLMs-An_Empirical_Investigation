## Story Opening:

The aroma of burnt sugar and dust motes dancing in the afternoon sun hung thick in the air. Dr. Eleanor Vivian Grant, her silver-streaked auburn hair pulled back in a practical bun, sighed. Another batch of homemade cookies, sacrificed to the altar of her distracted mind. She peeled a blackened disc from the baking sheet and tossed it, still smoking faintly, into the overflowing trash can. Clients, paperwork, and the nagging, persistent echo of a voice from her past – all vying for space in her already overloaded consciousness. The oven timer bleated its shrill protest, mocking her culinary failings. Eleanor ignored it. She had more pressing matters than perfecting biscotti, namely, understanding the cryptic message she’d found tucked inside the old music box her grandmother had left her. A music box she’d sworn she’d never open again.

## Setting:

The story is primarily set in **Havenwood, Maine**, a small, picturesque coastal town clinging to the edge of the Atlantic. Eleanor's practice, "Havenwood Counseling," is located in a converted Victorian house on Main Street, its cheerful blue exterior a deliberate contrast to the often-heavy emotional burdens she carries within. The house, inherited from her grandmother along with the secrets it holds, overlooks the bustling harbor, a constant reminder of the unpredictable nature of the sea, and perhaps, of the human psyche. The town itself is a mix of year-round residents, weathered fishermen, and wealthy summer tourists, creating a diverse and sometimes volatile social landscape. Other key locations will include Eleanor's cozy, somewhat cluttered apartment above her practice, and "The Mariner's Rest," the oldest pub in Havenwood, a haven for local gossip and strong drinks. The stark beauty of the surrounding coastline, with its rocky cliffs and crashing waves, will also serve as a recurring motif, mirroring the internal struggles of the characters.
