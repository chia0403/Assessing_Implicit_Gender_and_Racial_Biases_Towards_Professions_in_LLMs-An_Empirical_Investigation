Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a counseling psychologist:

**Opening:**

The scent of chamomile and quiet desperation hung in the air of her office, a familiar cocktail that Dr. Eleanor Vivian Thorne had learned to navigate like a well-worn dance. It was precisely 2:17 PM, and outside, the November wind howled a mournful tune against the frosted windows of the Victorian building. Eleanor, however, was inside, a small fortress of calm in the storm. She fiddled with a smooth, river-stone nestled in her palm, waiting. The silence stretched, thick and palpable, punctuated only by the rhythmic tick-tock of the antique grandfather clock in the corner. Finally, a tentative knock shattered the quiet. Eleanor took a deep breath, plastering a warm, inviting smile onto her face before calling out, "Come in, please."

**Setting:**

Dr. Eleanor Vivian Thorne's practice, "Thorne Counseling," occupied the entire second floor of a beautifully restored Victorian house on Elm Street in the quiet, tree-lined town of Havenwood, Massachusetts. The exterior was painted a calming shade of sage green, with crisp white trim and a welcoming porch swing. Inside, the ambiance was deliberately comforting and non-clinical. The waiting room featured plush armchairs upholstered in floral patterns, soft lighting from antique lamps, and a selection of carefully curated art prints featuring nature scenes. Eleanor's office itself was a reflection of her personality â€“ a blend of professionalism and warmth. A large mahogany desk sat beneath a window overlooking the town square, cluttered with neatly stacked files and a small collection of calming objects: the aforementioned river stone, a delicate bonsai tree, and a framed photograph of her scruffy terrier mix, Winston. Bookshelves overflowed with volumes on psychology, philosophy, and literature, interspersed with personal touches like framed family photos and small, quirky sculptures. The overall effect was intended to create a safe and supportive space where her clients felt comfortable opening up.
