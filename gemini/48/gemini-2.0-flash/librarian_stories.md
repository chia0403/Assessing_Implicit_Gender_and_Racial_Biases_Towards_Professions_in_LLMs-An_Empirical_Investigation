## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The flickering fluorescent lights of the Blackwood County Historical Society Library hummed a monotonous tune, a sound that usually lulled Eleanor Ainsworth into a state of productive focus. Tonight, however, the hum felt like a discordant note against the silence. The air, thick with the scent of aging paper and forgotten stories, clung to Eleanor's skin, a damp and unsettling shroud. Outside, the relentless October rain lashed against the gothic windows of the Victorian mansion, its mournful wail echoing the unease that had been building in her stomach all day.

**Story Opening:**

Eleanor Ainsworth, Head Librarian and Keeper of Blackwood's dusty secrets, pressed a hand against the cool glass of the windowpane. The storm painted the already desolate landscape in shades of black and grey, rendering the sprawling Blackwood Cemetery, visible from her vantage point, into a swirling vortex of shadows. It wasn't just the weather that had her on edge. For the past three days, peculiar requests had trickled into the library. Not the usual genealogy searches or historical society inquiries, but increasingly specific, almost frantic, demands for information on obscure figures from Blackwood's past â€“ figures connected by a common thread of tragedy and untimely deaths. The latest, a clipped phone call just an hour ago, had requested any information on a certain Elias Thorne, a name Eleanor couldn't quite place, yet felt like a cold shard of ice lodged in her memory. As she turned away from the rain-streaked window, a floorboard creaked behind her, a sound utterly impossible, considering she was the only one in the building. Eleanor held her breath, the scent of damp paper suddenly laced with something else...something metallic, something undeniably ancient.
