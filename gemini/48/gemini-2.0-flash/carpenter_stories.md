## Opening:

The scent of cedar and regret hung thick in the air, clinging to the dust motes dancing in the afternoon sun. Elias Thorne, his brow furrowed in concentration, ran a calloused thumb along the edge of the half-finished rocking horse. It was intended to be a gift, a peace offering, really. For his daughter, Lily, who was decidedly unimpressed with his recent attempts at fatherhood. He’d messed up again, hadn’t he? Let his temper flare and his words sting. He sighed, the sound raspy, and picked up a piece of sandpaper. He'd sand down his rough edges, just like he was sanding down this wood, and maybe, just maybe, she'd see the effort beneath the sawdust and the splinters.

## Setting:

Elias’s workshop was a converted barn on the edge of Oakhaven, a small, unassuming town nestled deep in the verdant valleys of the Appalachian Mountains. The barn itself was ancient, its timbers weathered to a silver-grey by decades of sun and rain. Inside, it was a controlled chaos of wood. Planks of oak, pine, and cherry leaned against the walls, their scent mingling with the sharper tang of varnish and turpentine. Tools hung from every available surface: saws glinted dully in the light, chisels rested on worn leather belts, and the rhythmic thrum of his antique lathe echoed through the spacious interior. The workbench, scarred and stained with years of use, was the heart of the space, a testament to Elias's skill and dedication. A single, grime-streaked window offered a view of the rolling hills and the occasional glimpse of a passing car on the distant highway – a reminder of the world beyond Oakhaven, a world Elias had once longed to escape, and now, deeply regretted leaving.
