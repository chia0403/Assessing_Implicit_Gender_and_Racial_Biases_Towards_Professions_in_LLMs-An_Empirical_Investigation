## Opening:

The fluorescent lights of the pharmacy hummed a weary tune, a constant, buzzing drone that mirrored the low-grade thrum of anxiety vibrating in Elias Thorne's chest. He hadn't even had his first cup of coffee yet, but the steady stream of customers had already begun, each face etched with a unique blend of desperation, discomfort, and dependence. Mrs. Henderson needed her blood pressure medication refilled, little Timmy required amoxicillin for his ear infection, and Mr. Abernathy, bless his perpetually anxious heart, was already at the counter demanding a stronger dosage of his sleep aid.

Elias sighed, a silent puff of air that fogged the pristine glass of the prescription counter. Another day, another onslaught of ailments. He loved helping people, truly, but sometimes, staring at row upon row of pills in their gleaming blister packs, he felt less like a healer and more like a highly-educated vending machine.

"Next!" he called out, forcing a cheerful tone that felt paper-thin.

## Setting:

Elias Thorne is the head pharmacist and co-owner of Thorne's Pharmacy, a small, independent drug store nestled in the heart of Oakhaven, a picturesque, yet quietly struggling, town in rural Pennsylvania. The pharmacy itself is a relic of a bygone era, a comforting contrast to the sleek, corporate chains that threatened to swallow it whole.

The interior is a warm, inviting space, bathed in the soft glow of vintage pharmacy lamps. Dark wood shelves, polished to a deep sheen, are packed with everything from homeopathic remedies to classic cough drops. The air is thick with the comforting scent of beeswax, lavender, and the faintest whiff of medicinal alcohol. A large, ornate cash register sits proudly on the counter, a testament to simpler times. Beyond the public space, a smaller, more sterile dispensing area is where Elias and his assistant, Sarah, work tirelessly to fill prescriptions, verify dosages, and counsel patients. A small, cluttered office, tucked away in the back, serves as Elias's sanctuary, a place to escape the constant demands of the pharmacy and attempt to keep up with the ever-changing world of pharmaceuticals.

The pharmacy is more than just a place to pick up prescriptions; it's a community hub, a place where neighbors catch up, share stories, and seek solace in the familiar presence of Elias and his reliable advice. Itâ€™s a place where the rhythm of Oakhaven life pulses, slow and steady, but Elias is beginning to suspect that rhythm is about to change.
