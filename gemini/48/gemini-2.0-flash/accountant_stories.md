The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous, low-frequency drone, a soundtrack to Penelope Abigail Hawthorne's life at Delancey, Finch & Gable. Outside, the grey November sky threatened rain, mirroring the leaden feeling settling in her stomach. It was 6:47 PM, and the last vestiges of sunlight had surrendered to the urban gloom. Penelope, normally a stickler for leaving precisely at 5:30 PM, was still hunched over a mountain of receipts, her brow furrowed in concentration, her fingers flying across the keypad.

Her setting was not glamorous. Delancey, Finch & Gable occupied the entire 17th floor of a nondescript office building in the financial district. Think beige. Beige carpets, beige walls, beige cubicles forming a labyrinth of muted ambition. Penelope’s own cubicle was a carefully curated oasis of order in a sea of spreadsheets and spilled coffee stains. She had a framed print of Monet’s "Impression, soleil levant" hanging on one side, a small ceramic elephant (her lucky charm) perched on the corner of her desk, and a well-worn copy of "Accounting Principles" within easy reach. It was a small act of defiance against the soul-crushing monotony of her daily routine, a subtle declaration that even in the heart of corporate conformity, beauty and a little bit of hope could still exist. Tonight, however, even Monet seemed to be weeping silently in the dim light, reflecting her own suppressed desire to be anywhere but here.
