Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a main character who is a drafting worker:

**Story Opening:**

The insistent hum of the fluorescent lights above mirrored the low-level anxiety thrumming beneath Walter Bartholomew Finch's ribs. Another Monday, another stack of blueprints taller than his coffee cup. He adjusted his spectacles, the thin wire digging slightly into the bridge of his nose, and inhaled deeply, the faint scent of ammonia and pencil lead filling his lungs - a familiar, almost comforting aroma despite the tedium it represented. He knew this building, this desk, this routine, better than he knew most of his own family. He straightened the meticulously aligned T-square and began to meticulously trace the latest revisions to the Section 4 pressure release valve, each stroke as precise and unwavering as if dictated by a machine. But even as his hand moved with practiced ease, a tiny seed of discontent, long dormant, began to sprout within him. It wasn't the work itself, not exactly. It was the *lack* of it. The lack of challenge, of creativity, of… well, of anything resembling a life beyond the lines he traced.
This morning, the seed bloomed into a full, thorny bush.

**Setting:**

The story is set in the late 1950s in the bustling but somewhat faded industrial district of New Haven, Connecticut. Walter works for "Everett & Sons Precision Engineering," a multi-generational family firm specializing in the design and manufacture of industrial components. The drafting office is a large, open space, typical of the era. Rows of drafting tables are lined up, bathed in the harsh glare of overhead fluorescent lights. The walls are a pale, institutional green, punctuated by framed photographs of previous Everett & Sons projects – bridges, factories, and massive machines. The air is thick with the scent of ink, drafting paper, and the aforementioned ammonia. The clatter of typewriters from the adjacent administrative office and the low murmur of conversations between draftsmen contribute to a constant, dull din. Each draftsman has their own designated space, a personal island of ordered chaos cluttered with blueprints, protractors, and coffee mugs stained with rings of dried coffee. It's a place of routine, precision, and quiet dedication – a microcosm of the post-war industrial boom, but also a place where dreams and ambitions can quietly suffocate under the weight of conformity.
