Okay, here's a story opening with the setting and full name of the main character, who is an occupational therapist:

**Story Opening:**

The scent of eucalyptus and old age hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume that Dr. Eleanor Beatrice Thorne had come to associate with Tuesdays at the Meadowbrook Assisted Living Facility. Eleanor adjusted her glasses, perched precariously on her nose, and pushed open the heavy oak door to the activity room. Her orthopedic tote bag, overflowing with textured balls, adaptive utensils, and brightly colored resistance bands, bumped against her hip.

Inside, a handful of residents were already gathered, their faces etched with a mixture of anticipation and apprehension. Mrs. Higgins, always the first to arrive, was meticulously arranging a tower of colorful blocks, her brow furrowed in concentration. Mr. Peterson, bless his heart, was attempting to operate the oversized television remote, his hands trembling with the effort.

Eleanor smiled, a genuine, warm smile that she hoped conveyed both professionalism and empathy. "Good morning, everyone! Ready for another Tuesday tune-up?"

**Setting:**

The primary setting is the Meadowbrook Assisted Living Facility, specifically the activity room. Meadowbrook is a fairly well-maintained, but slightly dated, assisted living facility located in the quiet, tree-lined suburbs of a medium-sized city (you could specify the city further if desired). The activity room itself is a large, brightly lit space with linoleum floors, mismatched furniture, and a general air of institutional comfort. It attempts to feel homey with posters of pastoral scenes and knitted blankets draped over armchairs, but the ever-present scent of disinfectant and the low hum of the fluorescent lights are constant reminders of its true purpose. The windows offer a view of a meticulously manicured garden, which provides a small oasis of nature.
