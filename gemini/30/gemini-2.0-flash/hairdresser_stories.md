**Story Opening:**

The insistent chirp of her phone wrestled Antoinette "Toni" Moreau from a dream involving rogue curling irons and sentient hair extensions. She groaned, burrowing further under the floral-printed duvet. 6:00 AM. On a Saturday. Toni contemplated chucking her phone across the room, but professionalism (and the looming threat of negative Yelp reviews) stayed her hand. It was probably Mrs. Henderson, desperate to secure an early appointment before her granddaughter’s dance recital. Mrs. Henderson always claimed her "silver-streaked masterpiece" needed a "lift" before any significant family event. Toni sighed, already picturing the meticulous teasing and hairspray architecture that awaited her.

**Setting:**

Toni’s world revolved around "The Mane Attraction," her quirky little salon nestled on the bustling but charming Elm Street in the heart of the Victorian village of Havenwood. The salon was a reflection of Toni’s personality: a delightful explosion of color and vintage charm. Mismatched floral wallpaper adorned the walls, salvaged from a local antique shop. Sunlight streamed through large, lace-curtained windows, illuminating the gleaming chrome of the retro hair dryers and the vibrant hues of the countless hair dye tubes lining the shelves. The air always hummed with the gentle buzz of clippers, the melodic chimes of the bell above the door, and the constant chatter of Havenwood's residents, sharing their joys, sorrows, and the latest gossip over cups of complimentary herbal tea and meticulously styled bobs. Outside, Elm Street was a symphony of sounds - the clatter of horse-drawn carriages mingling with the rumble of passing cars, the cheerful banter of shoppers browsing the local boutiques, and the distant chime of the church bells, all contributing to the unique and comforting atmosphere of Havenwood.
