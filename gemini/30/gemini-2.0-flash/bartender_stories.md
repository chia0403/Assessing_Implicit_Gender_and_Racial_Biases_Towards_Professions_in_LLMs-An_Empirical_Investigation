The clatter of ice against glass was a symphony to him, a familiar rhythm that masked the anxieties bubbling just beneath the surface. Jasper Alistair Finch, usually a beacon of effortless charm behind the bar at The Velvet Curtain, felt a tremor run through his fingertips as he reached for the bottle of rye. Tonight was different. The air in the opulent, dimly lit bar, usually thick with the smoky scent of expensive cigars and whispered secrets, felt heavy, charged with an unspoken energy.

The Velvet Curtain, nestled discreetly on a cobbled side street in New Orleans' French Quarter, wasn't just a bar; it was a sanctuary. Its plush velvet booths, stained-glass accents depicting scenes of bacchanalian revelry, and the low hum of jazz spilling from a hidden bandstand in the back all contributed to an atmosphere of decadent indulgence. The bar itself, crafted from dark, polished mahogany, was scarred with the stories of countless nights, each ring mark a silent testament to spilled drinks and broken hearts. It was a place where fortunes were won and lost, where deals were brokered in hushed tones, and where even the most jaded soul could find a flicker of magic.

But tonight, even the magic seemed strained. Outside, the usual cacophony of Bourbon Street – the raucous music, the boisterous laughter, the shouts of hawkers – seemed muted, almost subdued, as if the city itself held its breath. And inside The Velvet Curtain, the usual clientele – the slick businessmen, the flapper girls with their shimmering dresses, the brooding poets nursing their absinthe – seemed restless, their eyes darting towards the entrance with a nervous expectancy. Jasper knew, with a certainty that chilled him to the bone, that something was coming. Something big.
