## Story Opening:

The stale, recirculated air of the D.C. Metro did little to soothe Dr. Evelyn Reed's frayed nerves. She gripped the worn handle, the rhythmic screech of the train a jarring counterpoint to the internal monologue that had been plaguing her all morning. Another child. Another brutal, incomprehensible act of violence. This time, it was a ten-year-old boy, found discarded behind a playground swing set, his eyes wide with a fear that even death hadn't erased.

Evelyn squeezed her eyes shut, picturing the crime scene photos she’d skimmed through only an hour ago. The crisp, clinical shots couldn’t capture the raw horror, the utter senselessness of it all. As the train rattled into the Federal Triangle station, she took a deep breath, straightened her charcoal-grey blazer, and reminded herself why she did this. Someone had to understand the darkness that lurked within the human mind. Someone had to try and stop it.

She stepped onto the platform, the hum of the city buzzing around her like a swarm of angry bees.

## Setting:

The setting is **Washington D.C., specifically the Federal Triangle and the surrounding areas**. The year is the present day.

**Key elements of the setting:**

*   **The FBI Headquarters at the J. Edgar Hoover Building:** This will likely be a frequent location, as Evelyn works as a consultant for the Bureau, providing psychological profiles and expert witness testimony in particularly challenging cases.
*   **Forensic Psychiatry Unit:** This specific unit within the Hoover Building is where Evelyn spends most of her time, interacting with agents and reviewing evidence. It's a relatively sterile environment, filled with the quiet hum of computers and the low murmur of hushed conversations.
*   **The D.C. Metro System:** A vital part of the city’s infrastructure, the Metro provides a gritty, realistic backdrop. It’s a place where people from all walks of life converge, a constant reminder of the city's diverse and sometimes troubled population.
*   **Residential Areas:** The story will likely delve into the neighborhoods surrounding D.C., from affluent suburbs to struggling inner-city communities, each offering a different glimpse into the social and economic factors that can contribute to violent crime.
*   **Courtrooms:** The imposing halls of the D.C. Superior Court will be a stage for Evelyn to present her findings and face the intense scrutiny of lawyers and the media.

The overall atmosphere is one of **clinical detachment layered over a palpable sense of unease**. D.C. is a city of power and secrets, where beneath the veneer of political stability lurks a complex web of human behavior, often dark and unpredictable.
