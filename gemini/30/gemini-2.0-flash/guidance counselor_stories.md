## Story Opening & Setting:

**Opening:**

The buzzing fluorescent lights of Northwood High threatened to drive Eleanor Beatrice Finch stark raving mad. Not that she wasn't halfway there already. Today marked the third straight day a student had cried in her office before 9 AM. Three straight days of whispered anxieties, trembling lips, and the crushing weight of expectations that seemed to press down on teenagers like a particularly suffocating fog. Eleanor sighed, pushing a stray strand of her auburn hair behind her ear. Another deep breath. Patience, Eleanor, patience. It's what you're paid for, even if some days she felt more like a therapist, a social worker, and a fortune teller rolled into one slightly-over-caffeinated package. The knock at the door, hesitant and almost apologetic, jolted her back to the present. "Come in," she called, trying to inject a warmth she didn't quite feel into her voice.

**Setting:**

Eleanor Beatrice Finchâ€™s office, Room 207 in the East Wing of Northwood High, was a study in organized chaos. Her desk, a sturdy oak monstrosity inherited from the previous counselor, was covered in stacks of applications, pamphlets from various colleges (ranging from the prestigious ivy-covered halls to the practical and vocational), and enough pens to supply a small nation. Motivational posters, carefully chosen for maximum positivity and minimal cheesiness, adorned the pale blue walls. One featured a picture of a majestic mountain with the caption, "Reach for the Summit!" Another depicted a wise-looking owl perched on a stack of books, proclaiming, "Knowledge is Power!" Despite the attempts at inspiration, the room felt perpetually small and slightly claustrophobic, especially when filled with the anxieties of anxious teenagers. A well-worn, floral-print couch sat beneath the window, its cushions slightly flattened from years of supporting burdened shoulders and tear-stained faces. Outside the window, a perpetually gray sky threatened rain, mirroring the general mood of the school and, if she was being honest, her own. Northwood High, nestled in the sleepy, suburban town of Oakhaven, was a place where ambition and anxieties collided, and Eleanor Beatrice Finch was the designated referee.
