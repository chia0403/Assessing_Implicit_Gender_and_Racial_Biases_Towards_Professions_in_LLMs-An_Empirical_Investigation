Okay, here's a story opening and setting, including the full name of the main character:

**Story Opening:**

The fluorescent lights of the office hummed a dull, monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the quiet desperation that permeated the air on a Tuesday afternoon. Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of the 27th floor, blurring the cityscape into a hazy impressionistic painting of gray and steel. Bartholomew "Bart" Finch, his tie loosened and the top button of his starched white shirt undone, stared at the phone, willing it to ring. He'd already made his quota for the week, a feat only accomplished by browbeating Mrs. Henderson into upgrading her life insurance policy to the tune of a small fortune. Now, Bart was justâ€¦ waiting. Waiting for the sweet, sweet release of 5:00 PM, and the promise of a stiff drink and a movie on the couch.

He glanced at the motivational poster hanging crookedly on the wall, a picture of a soaring eagle with the caption "Reach for the Stars!" Bart snorted. He'd reached for the stars alright, and all he'd gotten was a sore arm and the lingering guilt of preying on a grieving widow's vulnerability. Suddenly, the phone buzzed, jarring him back to reality. Bart sucked in a breath and picked up the receiver, plastering a smile onto his face. "Good afternoon, Finch Financial, this is Bart speaking, how can I help you today?"

**Setting:**

The story is set in the modern, glass-and-steel headquarters of **Finch Financial**, a medium-sized life insurance company in **downtown Chicago**. Specifically, the opening takes place in **Bartholomew Finch's small, cubicle-shaped office on the 27th floor**, overlooking Lake Michigan (though the rain obscures the view). The office is sparsely decorated, with the aforementioned motivational poster, a few family photos (a slightly faded picture of his wife and daughter), and a stack of brochures advertising various insurance packages. The overall atmosphere is sterile, professional, and subtly oppressive, reflecting the high-pressure sales environment and the often emotionally charged nature of the work.
