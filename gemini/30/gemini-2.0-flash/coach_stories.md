## Story Opening:

The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, stinging Eleanor "Ellie" Vance's cheeks as she surveyed the empty bleachers of the Harrison High School soccer field. She tugged her wool cap lower, the fluorescent lights of the field reflecting in her tired eyes. It was barely 6 AM, a punishing hour even for a seasoned coach, but the sight of the pristine, dew-kissed field always brought a flicker of something akin to peace. Today, however, that peace was battling a tidal wave of anxiety. Tryouts were today. And this year, more than any other, felt like everything was riding on them. Not just for the team, but for Eleanor herself.

## Setting:

**Harrison High School, Chicago, Illinois. Late October.**

The school itself is a brick behemoth, built in the early 1900s. It boasts a certain gritty charm, with ivy clinging to its aging facade and the constant hum of city life bleeding through its thick windows. The soccer field, while meticulously maintained, is bordered by a chain-link fence that shows its age in patches of rust. Beyond the field, the skyline of Chicago pierces the horizon, a constant reminder of the pressures and temptations that draw young athletes away from the sport Ellie loves. The air is perpetually crisp and cold this time of year, carrying the scent of fallen leaves and the faint, metallic tang of the lake. The changing seasons are reflected in the rust-colored leaves scattered across the field and the steely grey of the sky, mirroring the anxieties and uncertainties that plague Eleanor as she enters another season of coaching.
