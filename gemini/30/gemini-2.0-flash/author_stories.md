The salt spray tasted of regret. Eleanor Beatrice Thorne stood on the windswept cliffs of Port Isaac, Cornwall, the biting air doing little to numb the ache in her chest. Below, the turquoise sea hammered against the rugged coastline, a relentless rhythm that mirrored the insistent drumming of anxiety in her head.

The little cottage sheâ€™d rented, aptly named "The Writer's Retreat," clung precariously to the hillside a few yards behind her. Its whitewashed walls and blue-shuttered windows offered a picture-postcard serenity, but Eleanor found no solace within. It was supposed to be the perfect escape, a sanctuary to wrestle her demons and, more importantly, finish her overdue novel.

Eleanor, a celebrated author of historical fiction with a penchant for tragic heroines and sweeping romances, had always found inspiration easy to conjure. Until now. Now, the blank page mocked her, the cursor blinking with a malevolent glee that echoed the emptiness she felt. The plot, once so vibrant and compelling, felt like a lifeless husk, a ghost of an idea. Perhaps the Cornish coast, with its wild beauty and dramatic history, would jolt her muse back to life. Or, perhaps, it would simply offer a beautiful backdrop for her slow, agonizing demise as a writer.
