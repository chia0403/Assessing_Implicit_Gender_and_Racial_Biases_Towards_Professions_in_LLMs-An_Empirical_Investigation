The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous dirge, a soundtrack to Arthur Penhaligon's existence. It wasn't a particularly inspiring dirge, more like the kind you'd hear at a budget funeral for a filing cabinet. Arthur, hunched over his meticulously organized spreadsheets in the small, cramped office of "Barnaby's Bolts and Bearings," hardly noticed anymore. Heâ€™d become immune to the hum, to the stale coffee aroma clinging to the air like a persistent ghost, even to the flickering bulb above his head that threatened to send him into a full-blown migraine.

Barnaby's Bolts and Bearings was a small, family-run business nestled in the industrial outskirts of Grimsborough, a town known more for its surprisingly pungent fish market than its burgeoning economy. The entire operation was housed in a single, corrugated iron warehouse, painted a shade of muddy green that Arthur suspected was originally intended to camouflage military equipment. Inside, it was a chaotic labyrinth of stacked boxes, rumbling forklifts, and the constant clang of metal against metal. Arthur's office, thankfully, was walled off, a tiny sanctuary carved out of the industrial pandemonium. It contained a desk overflowing with receipts, a rickety chair threatening to collapse at any moment, and a single window offering a breathtaking view of the adjacent parking lot and the perpetually grey Grimsborough sky. It was, in short, perfect. He thrived on the order he created within the chaos, the precision he brought to the disarray. Numbers, unlike people, rarely lied. And bolts? Well, bolts were beautifully, predictably... bolty.
