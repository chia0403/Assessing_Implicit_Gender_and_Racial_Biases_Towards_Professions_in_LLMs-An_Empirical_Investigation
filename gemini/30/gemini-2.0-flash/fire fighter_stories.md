The alarm screamed, a piercing wail that ripped through the early morning quiet of Fire Station 12. Not a gentle awakening, but a violent declaration. Lieutenant Evangeline "Evie" Riley bolted upright in her bunk, heart hammering against her ribs. The smell of brewing coffee, usually a comforting aroma, was now tainted with the sharp tang of adrenaline. The digital clock on the wall flashed 4:17 AM. Before her feet even hit the cold concrete floor, the dispatcher's voice crackled over the loudspeaker.

"Engine 12, Engine 21, Ladder 8 responding to a structure fire at 34 Elm Street. Reports of heavy smoke and possible occupants trapped. Repeat..."

Evie, her dark hair already escaping the loose braid sheâ€™d slept in, grabbed her bunker gear. Elm Street. Not far, but close enough to be personal. Close enough to be terrifying. The fire station, a sturdy brick building that had stood guard over the south side of the city for almost a century, shuddered with the sudden flurry of activity. Boots thudded on the floor, voices barked orders, and the roar of the engines warming up filled the air. This was it. This was why she woke up every day, this was why she'd dedicated her life to the roaring, unpredictable beast that was fire. This was the test.
