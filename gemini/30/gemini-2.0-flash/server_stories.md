The fluorescent hum of "Bernie's Bistro" was the anthem of Genevieve Marie Dubois' Monday nights. It buzzed in her ears, a constant, irritating reminder that she had three hours of smiling and pretending before she could finally collapse into her threadbare armchair and binge-watch documentaries about medieval blacksmithing. The air, thick with the aroma of overly-buttered garlic bread and simmering marinara sauce, clung to her like a second skin. 

Bernie's Bistro wasn't fancy. Located on the outskirts of a small, perpetually-cloudy town called Havenwood, Oregon, it was the kind of place where families gathered after little league games, couples on awkward first dates shared loaded potato skins, and the local book club discussed mysteries over bottomless cups of coffee. The red-and-white checkered tablecloths were perpetually stained, the vinyl booths were ripped and patched with duct tape, and the framed prints of Italian landscapes were slightly askew, as if sighing with resignation at their eternal post.

Tonight, a storm was brewing outside, mirroring the low-grade anxiety churning in Genevieve's stomach. The wind rattled the windows, and the parking lot was slick with rain. She hoped, selfishly, that the weather would keep the crowds down, but experience told her otherwise. Bad weather always drove people to Bernie's, seeking comfort in familiar food and the surprisingly genuine warmth Genevieve somehow managed to project, despite feeling like a cog in a perpetually-greased machine. She straightened her apron, took a deep breath that smelled faintly of pepperoni, and braced herself for the onslaught.
