Okay, here's a story opening with setting and a counseling psychologist main character:

**Setting:** The perpetual grey skies of Seattle pressed down on the city like a heavy, damp blanket. It was early October, and the Space Needle, usually a gleaming beacon, was half-obscured by a persistent drizzle. The air hung thick with the scent of wet leaves and exhaust fumes. Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, perched on the seventh floor of a converted brick warehouse in Pioneer Square, offered a partial view of the waterfront, though today, it was a view largely of fog and the restless churn of Puget Sound. The room was meticulously arranged to be both inviting and professional: a plush, oatmeal-colored sofa sat opposite two armchairs, a low table holding a box of tissues and a carefully curated selection of self-help books. A large abstract painting in muted blues and greens hung on the far wall, designed to be soothing rather than stimulating.

**Opening:**

Dr. Eleanor Vance, her auburn hair pulled back in a neat bun, watched the ferry cut a white swathe through the grey water. She took a slow sip of her lukewarm chamomile tea, the steam momentarily fogging her glasses. Her ten o'clock appointment was late. Again. Eleanor sighed, a quiet sound that was easily swallowed by the rhythmic drumming of the rain against the window. Liam O'Connell was a challenging patient, riddled with anxieties he seemed determined to both dissect and cling to. She admired his intelligence, his raw vulnerability, but the progress felt glacial. The clock ticked, each second amplifying the low thrum of her own anticipation. Was it another panic attack? A sudden change of heart? Or simply the chronic lateness of someone struggling to face what lay within? Eleanor placed her teacup down with a soft *clink*. She knew, from experience, that often the silence before the storm was the most telling of all.
