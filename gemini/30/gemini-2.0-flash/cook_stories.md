Inside, Mama Rosa's was a haven of old-world charm, checkered tablecloths adorning small tables, walls adorned with faded photographs of generations past, and the ever-present aroma of comfort and love, meticulously prepared. Amelia, however, wasn't feeling particularly loved at the moment. She had just discovered the mozzarella she’d been relying on for tonight’s lasagna was… decidedly moldy.
