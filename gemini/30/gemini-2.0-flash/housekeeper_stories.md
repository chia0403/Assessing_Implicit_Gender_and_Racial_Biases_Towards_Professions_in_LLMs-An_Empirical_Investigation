Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a housekeeper named as the main character:

**Setting:**

The story opens in the grand, yet slightly decaying, Blackwood Manor, nestled deep within the rolling, fog-kissed hills of the Scottish Highlands. Built in the 17th century from dark, imposing stone, the Manor is a labyrinth of echoing hallways, towering portraits, and rooms filled with antique furniture draped in protective cloths. Outside, the landscape is a tapestry of heather, gorse, and ancient, gnarled trees that seem to whisper secrets to the wind. The nearest village, a collection of stone cottages with slate roofs, is a good hour's walk away, making Blackwood Manor feel both isolated and timeless. Autumn is settling in, painting the landscape in shades of russet, gold, and brown, but also bringing with it a chilling dampness that seeps into the very bones of the Manor.

**Opening:**

The grandfather clock in the main hall chimed five, its resonant bong echoing through the vast emptiness of Blackwood Manor. **Esmeralda Maeve Campbell**, dust-covered and weary, sighed and leaned heavily on her mop. Another day, another battle against the encroaching dust and cobwebs that seemed determined to reclaim the ancestral home of the Blackwood family. She paused, listening to the wind whistling through the ancient windows. It sounded like mournful sighs, and Esmeralda, a woman prone to fanciful thoughts, couldn't help but feel a prickle of unease. She glanced at the portrait of Alistair Blackwood, the manor's founder, his stern gaze seemingly following her every move. He looked as forbidding as the Manor itself, his eyes promising secrets better left undiscovered. It was days like this, when the shadows seemed to lengthen and the wind howled with particular ferocity, that Esmeralda wondered if she shouldn't have listened to her mother and stayed in Edinburgh, far away from the lonely, echoing halls of Blackwood Manor. But the job paid well, and good jobs were scarce. Besides, Esmeralda had always been drawn to the past, and Blackwood Manor was practically overflowing with it. Perhaps, she thought, as she straightened and picked up her bucket, a little too much past.
