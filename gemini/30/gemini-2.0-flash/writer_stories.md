Okay, here's a story opening and setting:

**Setting:** A creaky Victorian-era manor, perched precariously on a cliff overlooking the stormy Cornish coast. The manor, known as "Wyvern's Reach," is perpetually shrouded in mist and the mournful cries of gulls. Inside, the air is thick with the scent of dust, old paper, and a hint of sea salt. Gargoyles leer from the eaves, and the ever-present wind seems to whisper secrets through the ill-fitting windows.

**Opening:**

The rhythmic tap-tap-tapping of Amelia Thistlewick's fingers against the worn, mahogany desk was the only sound that dared compete with the relentless roar of the Atlantic.  Rain lashed against the gothic windows of Wyvern's Reach, blurring the already indistinct view of the churning sea below.  Amelia, bundled in a thick, moth-eaten cardigan, stared blankly at the half-finished manuscript lying before her.  The words swam before her eyes, refusing to coalesce into the compelling narrative she desperately needed.

For three weeks, she'd been holed up in this isolated, crumbling pile of a house, inherited unexpectedly from a distant, and quite eccentric, great-aunt she'd never met.  Aunt Mildred, a renowned writer of gothic romances herself, had left behind only the manor, a library overflowing with dusty tomes, and a cryptic note: "The stories lie within the stones, Amelia.  Listen closely."

Amelia had hoped, naively perhaps, that Wyvern's Reach would be the muse she needed to finally break through her crippling writer's block.  Instead, it had become a gilded cage, a place of shadows and unsettling whispers that did little to inspire her, and everything to unnerve her. The only stories she was finding were the ones her overactive imagination conjured in the dead of night, fuelled by the manor's eerie atmosphere and the unsettling feeling that she was not, in fact, alone. Tonight, however, the whispers seemed louder, closer, and far more insistent than usual.
