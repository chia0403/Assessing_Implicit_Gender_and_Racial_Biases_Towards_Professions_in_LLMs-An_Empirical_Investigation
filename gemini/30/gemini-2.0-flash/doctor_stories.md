A desperate plea from her mentor, Professor Volkov, who had stayed behind to tend to the afflicted. He was gone now, another victim of the island's wrath, leaving Anya to carry on his work. And tonight, with the storm brewing on the horizon and a fresh influx of the infected staggering in from the ravaged fishing village, she felt utterly alone.
