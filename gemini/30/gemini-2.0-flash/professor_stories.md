The flickering fluorescent lights of the University of Cambridge's Botany School cast long, distorted shadows across the stacks of herbaria. A chill, deeper than the November air outside, clung to the room, a tangible byproduct of decades of dried leaves and faded Latin labels. Professor Elara Willowbrook, her silver hair pulled back in a severe bun that emphasized the sharp angles of her face, ignored both the cold and the oppressive quiet. She was lost, as she so often was, in the whispered history of the plant kingdom.

The Botany School, a gothic monstrosity constructed during the Victorian era, felt more like a mausoleum than a learning institution. Gargoyles leered down from the eaves, their stone faces perpetually stained with grime. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of dust, formaldehyde, and the faint, earthy perfume of a million forgotten blooms. Elara found solace in the organized chaos, in the meticulously preserved specimens that spoke of expeditions to forgotten corners of the earth, of dedicated botanists facing down fever and hostile climates in their relentless pursuit of knowledge.

Tonight, however, her usual refuge felt less comforting, more... unsettling. She was hunched over a particularly large, leather-bound volume, its pages brittle with age, illuminated only by the harsh, buzzing light above. The book, titled "De Herbis Daemonum" - "On the Herbs of Demons" - was a restricted text, rumored to contain information on plants with properties so potent, soâ€¦ unholy, that they were deemed too dangerous for general study. Elara, a renowned expert in ethnobotany and the historical uses of plants in religious rituals, had finally been granted access, and she couldn't shake the feeling that she'd opened a door she might soon regret.
