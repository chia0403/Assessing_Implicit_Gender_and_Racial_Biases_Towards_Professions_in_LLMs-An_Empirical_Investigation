The scent of industrial-strength disinfectant mingled with the sickly sweet aroma of art supply glue, a combination that, to Beatrice Eleanor Hawthorne, smelled like home. Specifically, Room 204 at Meadowbrook Elementary School, her home away from home. Beatrice stood perched on a tiny, brightly-colored chair, painstakingly alphabetizing a stack of construction paper – flamingo pink, dandelion yellow, sky blue – her brow furrowed in concentration.

It was the last day of summer vacation, a hazy, humid Monday in late August. The relentless cicada chorus outside the classroom window was the only other sound besides the rhythmic rustle of the paper. Sunlight streamed through the window, painting stripes across the linoleum floor and highlighting the dust motes dancing in the air.

Room 204 was a riot of controlled chaos. Beatrice had spent the better part of the week transforming the sterile space into a welcoming environment for her third-grade class. Alphabet posters, meticulously crafted with each letter adorned with relevant images (A for apple, B for butterfly), lined the walls. A reading nook, complete with a plush, oversized beanbag chair and a overflowing bookshelf, occupied one corner. On the bulletin board, a banner proclaimed "Welcome to Third Grade! Let's Soar!" above a collage of brightly colored, paper-mache birds.

Beatrice sighed contentedly, placing the last stack of paper in its designated slot. This year felt different. This year, she had a feeling, was going to be special. Little did she know, the "special" that awaited her in Room 204 would be unlike anything she had ever experienced before.
