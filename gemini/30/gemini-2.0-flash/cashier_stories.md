The fluorescent lights of the "Quick Stop & Go" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Abigail Willowbrook's Monday morning blues. At precisely 7:00 AM, the bell above the door jingled, signaling the arrival of her first customer, and Abigail plastered on her best customer service smile, the kind that felt stretched thin and brittle. The Quick Stop & Go was perched on the edge of Meadow Creek, a small, forgotten town where the most exciting thing that happened was Mrs. Henderson's prize-winning zucchini at the county fair. It was a haven for early-morning truckers, bleary-eyed commuters, and the occasional sleep-deprived student from the nearby university. Inside, shelves were crammed with everything from stale doughnuts and lottery tickets to motor oil and emergency rain ponchos. The air hung thick with the smell of cheap coffee and day-old pastries, a scent Abigail had grown to both resent and rely on. Today, a thin layer of frost coated the windows, obscuring the promise of a pale winter sun. It was going to be a long day.
