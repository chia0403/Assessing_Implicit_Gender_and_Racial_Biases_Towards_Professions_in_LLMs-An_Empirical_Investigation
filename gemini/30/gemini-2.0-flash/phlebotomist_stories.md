## Story Opening and Setting

**Story Opening:**

The needle slipped, just a hair's breadth, but enough. A prick of blood bloomed on Mrs. Henderson's already paper-thin skin, a tiny crimson rose against the landscape of varicose veins and age spots. Amelia Hayes sighed inwardly, a ghost of sound lost in the sterile hum of the fluorescent lights. "Just a tiny pinprick," she said, her voice smooth and reassuring, practiced to deflect the anxiety that rippled through her patients like a static charge. "All done now."

She plastered the band-aid with practiced efficiency, her gaze fixed on the small, now-covered wound, not daring to meet Mrs. Henderson's questioning eyes. It wasn't a big deal, a common enough occurrence in a profession where you dealt with fragile skin and even more fragile nerves. But today, everything felt…off. The weight of the past week, the relentless string of bad news, the simmering unease that had taken root in her gut, it all coalesced in that minuscule error, a tiny rebellion against the carefully constructed façade of competence she wore every day.

**Setting:**

The story is set in the **Quiet Waters Senior Living Facility** in the small, economically depressed town of Havenwood, Ohio. Quiet Waters, despite its name, is a bustling hub of activity, filled with the echoing chatter of residents, the clatter of dinner trays, and the pervasive scent of disinfectant and pot roast. Amelia works in the facility's small, dedicated phlebotomy room, a sterile and brightly lit space tucked away on the second floor, near the physical therapy wing. The room is crammed with essential equipment: a phlebotomy chair that looks suspiciously like an old dentist's chair, a rolling cart overflowing with needles, syringes, and test tubes, and a computer where Amelia meticulously logs patient data.

The windows offer a view of the facility's manicured lawn, a carefully constructed illusion of serenity that often clashes starkly with the reality of the residents' lives, and Amelia's own. Outside, the Ohio landscape sprawls, flat and monotonous, punctuated by struggling farms and the rusted skeletons of abandoned factories, a constant reminder of Havenwood's decline.
