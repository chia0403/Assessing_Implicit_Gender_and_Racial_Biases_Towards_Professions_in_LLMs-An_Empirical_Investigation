## Story Opening:

The clatter of stainless steel instruments, usually a comforting symphony to Penelope Anya Sharma, grated on her nerves this morning. Penelope, a dental hygienist with precisely manicured nails and a smile that could rival a toothpaste commercial, found herself staring blankly at the biohazard bin instead of prepping Mrs. Higgins' instruments. Usually, Penelope found a quiet satisfaction in transforming plaque-ridden chaos into pearly white order. Today, however, all she felt was a dull, persistent ache that resonated somewhere between her temples and the small of her back. It wasn't physical, though. It was… existential dental dread.

"Penelope?" Dr. Miller's voice, laced with his usual jovial condescension, sliced through her reverie. "Everything alright? Mrs. Higgins is waiting. And she's brought her scrapbook of championship poodle pictures, so brace yourself!"

Penelope plastered on a professional smile, one honed through years of dealing with anxious patients and eccentric poodle owners. "Right away, Doctor," she chirped, retrieving her mask and gloves. "Just admiring our… sanitary disposal system."

She knew, with a certainty that settled like plaque on a neglected molar, that today was going to be one for the books. And not in a good way.

## Setting:

Penelope works at **The Bright Smile Emporium** in the quaint, but rapidly gentrifying, seaside town of **Port Blossom, Maine**. The clinic, owned and operated by the perpetually tanned and suspiciously youthful Dr. David Miller, is a converted Victorian house painted a cheerful, if somewhat garish, shade of turquoise. Inside, the decor attempts to be both modern and charming, with sleek dental chairs nestled amidst floral wallpaper and framed watercolors of lighthouses. The waiting room boasts an oversized fish tank (Dr. Miller's pride and joy), a stack of outdated magazines, and an endless supply of peppermint-flavored floss. Port Blossom itself is a town clinging to its fishing heritage while simultaneously embracing the influx of wealthy summer residents and artisanal donut shops. The salty air, the constant screech of gulls, and the relentless influx of tourists provide a constant, low-level hum to Penelope's already stressed-out existence.
