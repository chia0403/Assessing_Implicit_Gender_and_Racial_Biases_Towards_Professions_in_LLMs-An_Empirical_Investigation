## Story Opening and Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The scent of old money and beeswax hung heavy in the air, a familiar and comforting aroma that usually soothed even Evelyn Rosewood's most frayed nerves. Today, however, it only served to heighten her growing anxiety. She clutched her well-worn leather portfolio to her chest, its familiar weight a small anchor in the sea of gilded opulence that threatened to swallow her whole. This wasn't just any project; this was the Montgomery Estate. And the woman waiting inside, Mrs. Eleanor Montgomery, was a force of nature known to make grown men weep and seasoned designers rethink their entire career.

Evelyn took a deep breath, straightened her perfectly tailored linen dress, and pasted on a smile she hoped appeared confident rather than terrified. "Showtime," she muttered to herself, and rapped lightly on the massive, mahogany door.

**Setting:**

The Montgomery Estate, nestled amidst rolling hills dotted with grazing horses, stood as a testament to generations of wealth and unwavering tradition. Located just outside of Upperville, Virginia, the sprawling Georgian mansion, known as "Rosewood Hall" (a cruel irony Evelyn couldn't help but appreciate), was a symphony of classical architecture and manicured gardens. Inside, antique furniture gleamed under the light of crystal chandeliers, and portraits of stern-faced Montgomery ancestors lined the walls. It was a place where history felt palpable, where whispers of the past echoed in the cavernous halls, and where every detail screamed of a life lived in unparalleled privilege.
