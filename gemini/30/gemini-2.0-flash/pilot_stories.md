## Story Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

The shrill klaxon tore through Amelia Grace Harding's concentration, a violent, echoing scream that vibrated through the cockpit of her ancient P-51 Mustang, "Sweet Sixteen." Her stomach lurched. That wasn't the pleasant "get ready to fly" buzzer. That was the "get ready to *die*" klaxon.

Sweat beaded on her forehead, plastering stray strands of auburn hair to her temples. She wrestled the oxygen mask tighter against her face, its familiar scent of rubber and metal strangely comforting in the face of impending doom. The instruments, usually a comforting symphony of needles and gauges, now felt accusatory, mocking her with their unwavering calm in the face of chaos. Outside the canopy, the serene expanse of turquoise sky had been swallowed by a churning, inky blackness.

"Ground control, this is Sweet Sixteen, say again!" Her voice, amplified by the headset, sounded thin and reedy, a pale imitation of the confident drawl she usually employed. Static crackled in response, the only answer she received.

Amelia gripped the control stick, knuckles white, and forced herself to breathe. Whatever was happening, she was on her own. And whatever it was, it felt… wrong.

**Setting:**

The year is 1957. Amelia Grace Harding is a barnstorming pilot based out of a dusty, privately owned airfield nestled amongst the rolling hills of rural Oklahoma. The airfield, christened "Harding's Haven" by Amelia's late father, is more of a sprawling homestead than a formal business. A weathered hangar, patched and repatched over the years, houses "Sweet Sixteen" and a collection of other vintage aircraft – remnants of Amelia's father’s wartime service and subsequent aviation obsession. A small, ramshackle office, filled with the scent of engine grease and old leather, overlooks the runway.

The surrounding countryside is a patchwork of golden wheat fields, dotted with the occasional grazing cow and the rusty silhouettes of oil derricks, a silent testament to the region's economic lifeblood. The town closest to Harding's Haven, Harmony Creek, is a sleepy, close-knit community where everyone knows everyone else's business, and the highlight of the week is the Friday night square dance.

However, beneath the veneer of idyllic rural life, a sense of unease hangs in the air. The Cold War casts a long shadow, and the whispers of potential nuclear annihilation are a constant undercurrent to everyday life. Amelia, usually too focused on her next airshow or repair project to pay much attention to politics, finds herself increasingly aware of the anxieties simmering beneath the surface of Harmony Creek. And now, with this inexplicable darkness engulfing the sky, those anxieties feel about to burst.
