## Story Opening:

The pre-dawn chill clung to the polished marble floor of the Grand Alexandria Museum, seeping through Theodore Humphrey Grimshaw's worn-out work boots and chilling him to the bone. He sighed, a plume of vapor briefly clouding the air before dissipating into the cavernous hall. Theodore, a man of sixty-two years with a face etched with a thousand untold stories and hands gnarled from decades of scrubbing and buffing, leaned heavily on his mop, its damp head leaving a gleaming, swirly trail in its wake.

He hated this shift.

The echo of his solitude was amplified by the vastness of the museum, a hollow sound that resonated with a loneliness he tried desperately to ignore. He preferred the late afternoon shifts, when the last stragglers of tourists shuffled out, murmuring about ancient artifacts and forgotten empires. At least then, there was a faint hum of human activity, a connection to the world outside the towering walls of glass and stone.

Tonight, however, it was just him, the ghostly statues in the Greco-Roman exhibit staring blankly ahead, and the unnerving feeling that he wasn't quite alone.

## Setting:

The Grand Alexandria Museum, a Beaux-Arts behemoth situated in the heart of a bustling, modern metropolis. While the city outside throbbed with neon lights and the constant cacophony of urban life, the museum stood as a silent sentinel, a repository of history frozen in time. Inside, grand halls stretched endlessly, lined with towering columns and adorned with intricate mosaics. Exhibits spanned millennia, showcasing artifacts from ancient Egypt, classical Greece, and the opulent courts of Renaissance Europe. The air hung heavy with the scent of aged parchment, polished wood, and a subtle, pervasive aroma of disinfectant, a constant reminder of Theodore's presence. Despite the wealth of history surrounding him, a palpable sense of detachment permeated the air, as if the past was forever separated from the present by an invisible barrier, a barrier Theodore was tasked with meticulously maintaining.
