## Opening:

The hum of the neon "Cuts & Curls" sign outside vibrated in rhythm with the jittery bass pumping from the cafe across the street. Inside, the scent of hairspray, stale coffee, and nervous anticipation hung heavy in the air, a familiar cocktail that usually soothed Henrietta "Henri" Periwinkle, but today felt like a prelude to a migraine.

Henri stared at her reflection, the fluorescent lights painting unflattering circles under her tired eyes. Today was a Tuesday. Usually, Tuesdays were predictable. Little old ladies wanting their weekly perm, students needing a quick trim before a big exam, the occasional rogue hipster looking for something ironically vintage. But today felt different. The air crackled with an unspoken tension, a feeling she couldn't quite place.

Henri smoothed down the wrinkles of her slightly-too-tight, floral-patterned apron. "Just another Tuesday, Henri," she muttered to her reflection, the pep talk sounding hollow even to her own ears. But she knew, deep down, that today was anything but.

## Setting:

**Cuts & Curls**, Henri's salon, occupied a narrow storefront on Elm Street in the heart of the sleepy, Midwestern town of Havenwood. The building was a relic of the 1950s, all pale pink Formica countertops and chrome-legged chairs that squeaked with the slightest movement. Henri had inherited the salon from her grandmother, Beatrice, a woman whose spirit still permeated the faded wallpaper and the lingering scent of her signature lilac perfume.

The main area consisted of three cutting stations, each equipped with a swivel chair, a large mirror, and a drawer overflowing with combs, brushes, and the tools of Henri's trade. Behind the cutting stations, a row of hair dryers, looking like oversized alien helmets, stood sentinel. In the corner, a small, cluttered waiting area held mismatched armchairs, dog-eared magazines, and a perpetually lukewarm coffee machine that gurgled ominously.

Beyond the main area, a small, dimly lit back room served as a washing station and storage space. This was Henri's sanctuary, where she could retreat to mix dyes, organize supplies, and occasionally indulge in a secret cigarette, hidden in a box of hairpins.

The overall ambiance was one of comfortable familiarity, a place where the women of Havenwood gathered to gossip, share secrets, and emerge feeling a little bit brighter, a little bit more confident, and a little bit more like themselves. But even the familiar comfort of Cuts & Curls couldn't shake the unsettling feeling clinging to Henrietta Periwinkle this Tuesday morning.
