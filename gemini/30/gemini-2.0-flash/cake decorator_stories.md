## Opening:

The buttercream was too soft. Impossibly, infuriatingly soft. Amelia Beatrice Bellweather cursed under her breath, her tongue sticking out between her teeth as she wrestled with the piping bag. The damn heat. She’d adjusted the thermostat twice already, but the sugar-sweet humidity of a Charleston summer clung to everything, turning her meticulously planned buttercream rosettes into drooping, deflated blobs. She squeezed harder, hoping to coax some semblance of structure from the wilting mass. No luck. 

“Blast it all!” she muttered, tossing the piping bag onto the stainless-steel counter with a frustrated thump. The sound echoed slightly in the cavernous space of her bakery, a sound that felt disproportionately loud in the stifling silence.

## Setting:

Amelia’s haven, and her personal hell at that particular moment, was “Bellweather’s Sweets,” a brightly-lit, deceptively spacious bakery nestled on a quiet side street just off King Street in downtown Charleston, South Carolina. The storefront was painted a cheerful robin's egg blue, with wrought-iron window boxes overflowing with vibrant pink geraniums. Inside, the walls were lined with shelves displaying antique cake stands, whimsical cookie jars, and a collection of vintage rolling pins that Amelia had been collecting since she was a little girl.

The air, normally thick with the intoxicating aroma of vanilla, cinnamon, and melting chocolate, today just felt…heavy. Three gleaming stainless-steel work tables dominated the back of the bakery, each cluttered with spatulas, bowls, and half-finished decorations. A large, double-door convection oven stood silently in the corner, a metal beast capable of churning out dozens of perfect cupcakes in a single batch. To the right, a walk-in refrigerator hummed a low, constant drone, fighting a losing battle against the oppressive heat.

Through the front window, Amelia could see the historic cobblestone street shimmering in the afternoon sun. Tourists, weighed down with shopping bags and maps, strolled past, oblivious to the internal battle being waged within the walls of Bellweather’s Sweets. They wouldn't know the exquisite pressure of perfection that Amelia carried on her shoulders, the expectation that every cake, every cupcake, every delicately iced sugar cookie should be a miniature masterpiece. And right now, with the buttercream melting faster than she could pipe it, that expectation felt crushingly heavy.
