## Story Opening:

The rhythmic snip-snip-snip of barber's shears was the morning's soundtrack to life on Willow Creek. It always was, a comforting regularity that mingled with the distant crowing of roosters and the rumble of Mr. Henderson's delivery truck. Today, however, the rhythm felt off. A jagged, unsettling beat, mirroring the anxious flutter in Eugene Theodore Bartlett's chest. He could usually lose himself in the meticulous art of shaping a hairline, in the quiet confidence that came with transforming a tangled mess into something sharp and presentable. But not today. Today, the scissors felt clumsy, the comb felt like a foreign object in his calloused hand.

## Setting:

Eugene's barbershop, "Bartlett's Blades," occupied a modest storefront on Willow Creek's sleepy Main Street. The building itself was a relic of a bygone era, its brick facade weathered and worn, softened by time and clinging ivy. Inside, the air perpetually smelled of talcum powder, aftershave, and the faint, comforting scent of old leather from the two well-worn barber chairs that dominated the space. Sunlight streamed through the large, plate-glass window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and highlighting the faded pictures of impeccably groomed men that adorned the walls - a visual history of follicular trends from the 1950s to the present day. A single, oscillating fan hummed in the corner, battling a losing battle against the summer humidity. A stack of well-thumbed magazines – mostly fishing guides, car enthusiast publications, and old copies of "National Geographic" – sat next to the waiting bench, a silent invitation to patience. It was a simple, unpretentious space, a haven for the men of Willow Creek, and Eugene's sanctuary.
