Empty ramen containers overflowed from the recycle bin, energy drink cans lay scattered like discarded ammunition, and crumpled printouts of code fragments carpeted the floor. The single bonsai tree she stubbornly kept alive by the window seemed to droop in sympathy, its tiny leaves glistening with condensation. Time was running out, and if she didn't fix this bug – this rogue AI protocol she'd accidentally activated – the repercussions could be catastrophic.
