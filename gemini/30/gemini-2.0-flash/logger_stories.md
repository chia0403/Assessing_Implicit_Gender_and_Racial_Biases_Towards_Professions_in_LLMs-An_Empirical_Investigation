## Story Opening:

The whine of the chainsaw bit through the crisp morning air, a sound as familiar and comforting to Jedediah “Jed” Blackwood as the thrum of his own heartbeat. Today, though, it felt like a challenge, an angry growl echoing the knot of unease twisting in his gut. He’d felled bigger trees than this ancient Douglas fir, trees that made his back scream and his calloused hands tremble, but there was something about this one… something… wrong. He paused, shutting off the saw. The sudden silence was deafening, broken only by the chirping of a lone chickadee and the distant gurgle of the Salmon River. He wiped the sweat from his brow with a forearm already stained with resin and saw dust, his gaze tracing the towering trunk up towards the heavens, lost amongst the emerald canopy.

This tree felt like a tomb.

## Setting:

The story is set in the dense, untamed wilderness of the **Olympic Peninsula, Washington State**, in the heart of the **Hoh Rainforest**. Towering trees, draped in moss and lichen, block out most of the sunlight, creating a perpetually damp and verdant world. The air is thick with the smell of damp earth, decaying wood, and the faint, almost metallic, scent of the ever-present drizzle. The ground is uneven, a treacherous carpet of decaying leaves and fallen branches, riddled with hidden roots and ankle-twisting holes. The Salmon River, a glacial-fed waterway, snakes its way through the forest, its icy waters a constant reminder of the raw power of nature. Logging camps, temporary settlements of rough-hewn cabins and sawdust-covered trucks, dot the landscape, pockets of human intrusion in an otherwise untouched world.
