The setting was New Orleans in the thick of July, the kind of heat that clung to you like a shroud. Humidity hung heavy in the air, turning every breath into a small, personal sauna. Even the Mississippi seemed to be sweating as it sluggishly wound its way past the French Quarter, shimmering under a merciless sun. Above, a lazy haze obscured the otherwise vibrant blue of the sky.

A street musician, hunched over a battered saxophone on Decatur Street, was attempting a mournful rendition of "St. James Infirmary," but the notes seemed to wilt and die before they could reach any appreciative ears. Tourists, wilting beneath the heat, trudged from souvenir shop to beignet stand, their voices a listless murmur that blended with the clatter of the streetcar and the distant blare of a passing barge.

Sergeant Evangeline "Evie" Dubois stepped out of her patrol car, the blast of heat hitting her like a physical blow. Even in the air-conditioned vehicle, the heat had seeped in, leaving a damp film on her skin. She pulled her sunglasses down, the tinted lenses offering only a marginal reprieve. Decatur Street, usually bustling with life, felt sluggish and subdued, mirroring the oppressive heat. Today, even crime seemed to be taking a siesta. She adjusted her gun belt, the leather sticking uncomfortably to her skin, and took a deep breath, the humid air doing little to cool her. A call had come in - a disturbance at Marie Laveauâ€™s House of Voodoo. Evie knew these calls were usually tourist-fueled nonsense, but duty called.
