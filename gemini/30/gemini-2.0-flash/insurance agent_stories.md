Okay, here's a story opening and setting for an insurance agent main character:

**Setting:** The waiting room of Dr. Evelyn Reed's OB/GYN practice, located in a recently renovated medical building in the trendy "Brewery District" of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The walls are painted a soothing sage green. Mid-century modern furniture is scattered artfully across a patterned rug, and a flatscreen TV silently displays images of healthy babies. The air smells faintly of disinfectant and lavender.

**Story Opening:**

Arthur James Finch, a name too grand for a man who spent his days selling dental insurance, adjusted his tie for the tenth time in as many minutes. The waiting room of Dr. Evelyn Reed's office felt impossibly sterile, a far cry from the cozy, cluttered chaos of his own agency. He was surrounded by pregnant women, their faces a mixture of excitement and weary anticipation. Arthur, on the other hand, felt nothing but a rising tide of panic.

His palms were sweating. Heâ€™d already downed a lukewarm cup of stale coffee and flipped through a three-year-old issue of *Parents* magazine so many times he could practically recite the articles by heart. He knew he should be reviewing his talking points for this new client, the one who came highly recommended by his boss, but the words swam before his eyes. His mind kept wandering back to the reason why he had signed up for this in the first place, he just needed one big win to get him out of selling home insurance. Arthur had always excelled at selling life insurance, but after the incident with Mrs. Abernathy, he had been banished to the depths of home insurance. This new client was just the ticket to his return to glory.
