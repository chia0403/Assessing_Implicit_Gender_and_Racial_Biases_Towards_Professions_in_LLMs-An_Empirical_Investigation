The biting wind, smelling of pine and the unforgiving North Sea, whipped through the narrow gap between the fishing boats stacked like dominoes in the harbor. Winter had arrived early in Stonehaven, and even inside his small workshop, the drafts snaked through the gaps in the mismatched stone walls. Thomas Alistair Finch, his brow furrowed in concentration, rubbed a gloved hand over the smooth surface of the oak he was shaping. Sawdust clung to his beard, a testament to the hours he’d already dedicated to this particular commission.

His workshop, “Finch’s Fine Furnishings,” was crammed into a corner of what had once been a stable, just a stone’s throw from the harbor’s bustling quay. It was a hodgepodge of tools – ancient hand planes inherited from his grandfather hung alongside gleaming, modern power tools. The air was thick with the scent of wood shavings, linseed oil, and a faint undercurrent of the sea, a smell that was as familiar to Thomas as his own name. He loved this space, this chaos, this tangible connection to generations of craftsmen who had come before him.

Today’s project was particularly challenging: a replica of a captain's chair from a shipwreck, commissioned by Mrs. McTavish, a formidable widow with a penchant for historical accuracy and an unwavering eye for detail. Thomas had pored over photographs and sketches, even venturing out to the coastal museum in Aberdeen to examine similar artifacts. He needed to get it right, not just for Mrs. McTavish, but for himself. He prided himself on his skill, on his ability to breathe life back into wood, to create something beautiful and lasting from raw materials. But something about this chair felt different, heavier somehow, like he was more than just a carpenter – he was a conduit for history, a keeper of secrets buried beneath the waves. And that, he wasn't entirely sure he was ready for.
