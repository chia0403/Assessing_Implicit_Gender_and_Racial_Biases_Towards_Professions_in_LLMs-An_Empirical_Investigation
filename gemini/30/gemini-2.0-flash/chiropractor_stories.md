## Story Opening:

The scent of peppermint and rubbing alcohol hung heavy in the air, a comforting, if clinical, aroma that always reminded Dr. Eleanor Maeve Ainsworth of home. Or, at least, her professional home. Rain hammered against the panoramic window of her office, a relentless rhythm that mirrored the knot of tension in her own shoulders. Outside, the Seattle skyline was a watercolor blur of grey and steel, swallowed by the storm. Inside, the soft glow of the Himalayan salt lamp on her desk cast dancing shadows on the framed diplomas and anatomical charts that adorned the walls.

Eleanor chewed thoughtfully on the end of her pen, staring at the skeletal diagram on her monitor. Mrs. Higgins, her next patient, had been complaining of radiating pain down her left leg for weeks. The X-rays hadn't revealed anything obvious, and Eleanor suspected a subtle misalignment in the lumbar region, exacerbated by Mrs. Higgins's enthusiastic Zumba classes. A deep breath. She needed to be sharp, present, and ready to coax the body back into its natural alignment. 

She glanced at the clock, a polished chrome number that Dr. Ainsworth inherited from her grandfather, also a chiropractor. 2:57 PM. Just enough time for another sip of the lukewarm chamomile tea she'd brewed hours ago and a quick mental rehearsal of her assessment protocol. The door to the waiting room creaked open, and her receptionist, a perpetually cheerful woman named Brenda, poked her head in. "Dr. Ainsworth, Mrs. Higgins is here."

Eleanor straightened, a genuine smile spreading across her face. "Send her in, Brenda."

**Setting:**

Eleanor Maeve Ainsworth's chiropractic office, "Ainsworth Wellness Center," is located on the 17th floor of a modern building in Seattle's bustling downtown. The decor is clean and minimalist, with a focus on natural light and calming colors. Exposed brick walls contrast with the sleek, contemporary furniture, creating a space that feels both professional and inviting. The treatment room is equipped with a state-of-the-art chiropractic table, a digital X-ray machine, and a variety of other tools and equipment. The waiting room features comfortable seating, a selection of healthy magazines, and a water cooler infused with fresh fruit. The overall atmosphere is one of quiet professionalism and holistic well-being, a reflection of Dr. Ainsworth's own philosophy of care. Outside, the ever-present Seattle rain provides a dramatic backdrop to the daily workings of the practice.
