## Story Opening:

The smell of sawdust, blood, and juniper clung to Arthur Bartholomew Finch like a second skin. He could scrub his forearms raw, even scour his fingernails until they bled, but the essence of Finch & Son Butchers, Est. 1888, would remain. Arthur didn't mind, not really. It was the smell of his heritage, the smell of honest work, the smell of a legacy slowly, inexorably, turning sour.

This morning, the sourness was particularly potent. It wasn't just the fact that old Mrs. Hawthorne had complained for the third time this week that the mince was "too red" (what did she expect, for God's sake, sawdust?), or that young Timmy Pritchard had managed to slice his finger while cleaning the band saw (again!). No, this sourness was different, deeper, laced with a subtle metallic tang that had nothing to do with the fresh cuts of pork hanging in the walk-in cooler.

Arthur stood at the large, scarred oak counter, the morning sun glinting off the freshly sharpened butcher knife in his hand. He was meticulously trimming a rack of lamb, each precise cut honed by decades of practice. But his gaze wasn't on the meat. It was fixed on the reflection in the polished blade, a grim reflection of the man he was, and the man he feared he was becoming.

## Setting:

**Finch & Son Butchers is located in the small, rapidly gentrifying town of Havenwood, nestled in the rolling hills of the Cotswolds.**

*   **The Shop:** The shop itself is a time capsule. The original mosaic floor tiles are worn smooth, depicting scenes of pastoral bliss: grazing sheep, contented cows, a plump pig in its pen. The walls are lined with cracked, pale-yellow tiles, some missing, revealing the brick beneath. Display cases, once gleaming with brass, are now dull with age and only partially illuminate the various cuts of meat. Behind the counter, a large chalkboard displays the daily specials in faded, elegant lettering. The air is a constant blend of sawdust, meat, and the faint, persistent smell of disinfectant.
*   **Havenwood:** Havenwood is a place caught between the past and the present. Quaint tea rooms and antique shops sit alongside trendy cafes and art galleries. The influx of wealthy Londoners looking for a slice of rural tranquility has driven up property prices and changed the dynamic of the town. Arthur, born and raised in Havenwood, feels increasingly like an outsider in his own home. He watches as the old ways are chipped away, replaced by avocado toast and yoga retreats. The arrival of "The Veganerie," a stylish plant-based restaurant just across the street, has only solidified his anxieties about the future of his family business, and perhaps, his entire way of life.
