The stale, metallic scent of instant coffee hung in the air, a fitting aroma for the grim reality staring back at Amelia Harding from the screen. Her eyes, bloodshot from too little sleep and too much blue light, scanned the police report for the tenth time. Paragraph after paragraph of sterile details: victim, identified as Elias Thorne, age 42, found deceased in his residence, cause of death pending investigation. No forced entry. No witnesses. Just another statistic in a city drowning in them.

The setting was Amelia's cramped apartment in the perpetually grey Brooklyn neighborhood of Sunset Park. The "living room" was barely large enough to swing a cat, crammed with overflowing bookshelves, stacks of newspapers dating back months (fodder, she told herself, for future Pulitzer-winning stories), and a beat-up, olive-green armchair that had seen better days. Sunlight, when it dared to break through the smog and the brick buildings outside, barely reached past the window. It was the kind of place that fostered a quiet desperation, a feeling Amelia both hated and, in some twisted way, thrived on. It was in this space, surrounded by the ghosts of forgotten stories, that Amelia Harding, journalist for the struggling online publication *The Gotham Gazette*, began to unravel the threads of her next one.
