## The Salt Witch

The biting March wind whipped off the Atlantic, stinging Amelia Grace Harding's cheeks and tugging at the edges of her knitted hat. She pulled her scarf tighter, squinting at the churning grey expanse beyond the breakwater. Usually, the ocean was a source of solace for her, a constant rhythm that mirrored the ebb and flow of life and death she witnessed daily at the clinic. But today, its restless energy only amplified the nagging unease in her stomach.

The setting was Port Blossom, Maine, a quintessential New England fishing village clinging to the rocky coastline. Its charm was undeniable: weathered clapboard houses painted in shades of faded blue and grey, a church steeple piercing the perpetually overcast sky, and the ever-present tang of salt and seaweed in the air. Tourism kept the place afloat in the summer, attracting weekenders eager for lobster rolls and scenic harbor cruises. But in the winter, the population dwindled, the wind howled through the narrow streets, and a palpable sense of isolation settled over the town like a shroud.

Amelia, a physician's assistant at the Blossom Family Clinic, had lived in Port Blossom for five years, a transplant from the bustling city of Boston. She’d come seeking a slower pace, a chance to make a real difference in a community. And she had, stitching up fishermen, dispensing cough syrup to wheezing children, and comforting the elderly as they navigated the aches and pains of aging. But lately, a disquiet had begun to prick at the edges of her contented routine. A feeling that something was…off. Something more than the usual winter blues. And today, watching the angry sea, that feeling felt less like a whisper and more like a scream in the wind.
