The air hung thick and humid, clinging to everything like a damp shroud. Heat shimmered off the cracked asphalt of Highway 17, blurring the already hazy line between the road and the scrubby pine forest that lined its edges. The only sound was the relentless drone of cicadas and the rhythmic thud of a distant pile driver, a sound that always made Harold Francis Callahan’s teeth ache. He leaned against the battered cab of his orange Department of Transportation truck, wiping sweat from his brow with the back of his work-gloved hand.

Harold hated this stretch of highway. Not just because it was notoriously prone to flash floods in the spring and ice storms in the winter, and not just because the sun beat down on the exposed asphalt like a malevolent spotlight. It was more than that. He could feel a tension in the air, a low hum of unease that vibrated in his bones, especially in the early mornings before the traffic picked up. He told himself it was just the fatigue of another long shift, another day of patching potholes and dodging reckless drivers, but deep down, Harold knew there was something… off about this place. Something more than just the heat.
