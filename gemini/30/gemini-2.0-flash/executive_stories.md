**Opening:**

The insistent chirping clawed its way through Amelia Hawthorne's REM cycle like a persistent mosquito. She groaned, burrowed deeper under her silk duvet, and tried to ignore the shrill assault on her senses. Five more minutes. That’s all she asked. But the digital clock on her nightstand, illuminated a harsh crimson 5:00 AM, was unyielding. It was not a request, but a command.

**Setting:**

Amelia's bedroom was a testament to curated calm. Located on the 47th floor of The Residences at Hudson Yards, the space was designed by a renowned minimalist architect, all clean lines, muted greys, and natural textures. Floor-to-ceiling windows offered a breathtaking panorama of the city skyline, a shimmering tapestry of lights slowly awakening. But this morning, Amelia barely registered the view. The carefully chosen art – a Rothko-inspired abstract piece – felt heavy, the soft cashmere throw on the Arne Jacobsen Swan chair a suffocating weight. Her life, usually a symphony of controlled efficiency and strategic planning, felt discordant, a cacophony of deadlines and demands threatening to overwhelm her. The air, usually crisp and filtered, felt thick with the weight of expectation.
