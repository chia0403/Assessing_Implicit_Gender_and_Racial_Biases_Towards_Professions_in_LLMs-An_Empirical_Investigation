The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum color, bled through the blinds of the office, painting stripes across Dr. Eleanor Marguerite Ainsworthâ€™s desk. Dust motes danced in the beams, a silent ballet she usually found calming, but today only amplified the thrumming anxiety in her chest. Her fingers drummed a nervous rhythm against the stack of meticulously color-coded patient files that littered her workspace. "Nourish & Flourish," the tastefully minimalist sign outside her door proclaimed, a name Eleanor had chosen with naive optimism five years ago when she'd first opened her practice in the heart of Meadowbrook, a perpetually-blooming suburb just outside of Portland.

Meadowbrook, a place where manicured lawns met perfectly-stacked firewood and the air perpetually smelled of lavender and mild resentment, was, on the surface, the ideal place for a nutritionist. Yet, Eleanor was starting to suspect its residents were more interested in the aesthetic of healthy living than the actual practice. They'd buy the organic kale, yes, but then drown it in ranch dressing and order a triple-chocolate fudge brownie for dessert.

The aroma of roasted hazelnut coffee, emanating from the trendy cafe downstairs, usually grounded her, but today, even that comforting scent felt like a subtle taunt. Eleanor was drowning in a sea of unrealistic expectations and fad diets, and frankly, she felt like she was losing the battle. Her phone buzzed on her desk, a fresh wave of anxiety washing over her. It was probably another potential client asking about the "Ketotarian Carnivore Cleanse" that their favorite influencer was peddling. Eleanor sighed, her hand hovering over the phone, bracing herself for another conversation about the magical powers of activated charcoal and the evils of perfectly good gluten.
