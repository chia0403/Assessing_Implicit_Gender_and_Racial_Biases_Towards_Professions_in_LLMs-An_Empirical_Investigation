The cloying scent of lavender hung heavy in the air, battling the stubborn, metallic tang of blood that lingered in Amelia Grace Sterling's nostrils. It was a losing fight, she knew. The lavender was a carefully curated concoction designed to lull her clients into a state of bliss, but nothing could truly mask the fact that her fingers, usually kneading tight muscles and soothing knotted shoulders, were currently coated in crimson. Not hers, thankfully, but the residue of another messy Tuesday evening.

Amelia Grace Sterling, Licensed Massage Therapist and reluctant, occasional cleaner-upper for the less savory elements of Port Blossom’s population, surveyed her massage room. It wasn’t much – a converted guest room in her small Victorian house, painted a soft, seafoam green and adorned with framed prints of crashing waves. The massage table, normally covered in a pristine white sheet, was now a canvas of unsettling splatter patterns, mostly covered by a heavy-duty tarp.

Port Blossom itself was a charming coastal town, perched precariously on the edge of the Pacific Northwest. Picturesque, yes, with its clapboard houses clinging to the cliffs and the salty air thick with the promise of rain. But beneath the veneer of quaintness simmered a darkness that Amelia had become intimately acquainted with. A darkness that paid handsomely for a good back rub, a listening ear, and a promise to keep its secrets. A darkness that sometimes, however reluctantly, required her to dabble in the art of crime scene cleanup.
