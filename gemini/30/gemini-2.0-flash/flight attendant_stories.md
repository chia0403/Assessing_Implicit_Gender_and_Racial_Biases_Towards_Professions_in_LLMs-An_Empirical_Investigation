## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** A Boeing 777-300ER, registration N779UA, belonging to United Airlines, is shuddering violently over the Atlantic Ocean, roughly halfway between Boston and Dublin. Outside, the sky is a bruised purple-grey, and intermittent flashes of lightning illuminate the wingtips. Inside, the cabin lights flicker erratically, casting long, dancing shadows. The smell of recycled air and stale coffee is thick in the air, now laced with a faint, metallic tang.

**Story Opening:**

“Ladies and gentlemen, this is your Captain speaking. We are experiencing some moderate turbulence. Please return to your seats and fasten your seatbelts. I repeat, please return to your seats and fasten your seatbelts.” The Captain’s voice, usually a smooth baritone designed to soothe anxieties, now carried a distinct edge of urgency.

**Eleanor Grace Davies**, wiping condensation from the galley window, swallowed hard. Moderate turbulence? She'd been flying for twelve years, eight of them with United, and she knew the difference between a gentle bump and the kind of bone-jarring shake currently threatening to spill the complimentary ginger ale from the overflowing bin. This was beyond moderate. This was edging into ‘hold-on-to-your-holy-artifacts’ territory.

She glanced down the aisle. Most passengers were already buckled in, their faces a mixture of apprehension and forced nonchalance. A few were still fumbling with their seatbelts, their movements jerky with fear. She caught the eye of Mrs. Higgins in 12B, a frail woman clutching a rosary, her lips moving in silent prayer. Eleanor offered her a reassuring smile, though inside, her own stomach was churning with a dread that had nothing to do with turbulence. Something was wrong, terribly wrong, and it wasn't just the weather.
