Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a roofer named Bartholomew "Bart" Finch as the main character:

**Setting:**

The relentless July sun beat down on the small town of Havenwood, Ohio, baking the asphalt streets and turning every surface into a shimmering mirage.  Houses, mostly modest bungalows and two-story colonials, were spaced just far enough apart to offer a sliver of privacy, their lawns struggling valiantly against the heat.  The air was thick with the scent of freshly cut grass, exhaust fumes from passing trucks, and the faint, metallic tang of the Ohio River, which snaked its sluggish way just beyond the western edge of town.  The sky was a merciless blue, devoid of clouds, promising another day of unrelenting heat.

**Opening:**

Bartholomew "Bart" Finch squinted, the glare reflecting off the chipped asphalt shingles he was precariously balanced upon. A bead of sweat traced a path down his temple, stinging his eye. He cursed under his breath, not at the heat, not at the treacherous pitch of Mrs. Henderson’s roof, but at the damn rusty nail he’d just hammered halfway into his thumb.  He sucked on the wound, tasting blood and metal, and mentally added another item to his ever-growing list of things he desperately needed but couldn't afford.  New work gloves.  His old ones were more hole than glove at this point.

"Everything alright up there, Bart?" Mrs. Henderson’s voice, amplified by the open window of her attic, startled him.

He straightened, wincing. "Just peachy, Mrs. Henderson! Just admiring your… uh… *robust* gutters!" He hoped his grin looked more convincing than it felt.  He knew she couldn't see him, but years of working in the service industry had ingrained a reflex to maintain a cheerful façade, even when he felt like pitching himself right off the roof and into her prize-winning rose bushes. Today, though, he felt particularly like a rose bush projectile.
