The humid Atlanta air hung thick and heavy, even at seven in the morning, clinging to Madeline Eleanor Sterling like a damp shroud. Madeline, known as Maddie to pretty much everyone except her disapproving mother and the Department of Revenue, sighed and adjusted the collar of her crisp, white blouse. It was already starting to stick to her skin. This was precisely why she hated showing houses in July.

She stood perched on the meticulously manicured lawn of 12 Oak Haven Drive, a sprawling Colonial revival that looked more like a small hotel than a family home. Oak Haven, a gated community nestled in the leafy suburbs of Buckhead, was the kind of place where the grass was always greener, the cars were always shinier, and the secrets were always deeper. This particular house, owned by the notoriously private Mr. and Mrs. Atherton (rumored to be descendants of a prominent Coca-Cola family, naturally), had been on the market for six agonizing months. Six months of open houses filled with silent, judgmental stares and whispered criticisms about the "dated" kitchen.

Maddie, a real estate agent with Sterling Properties for the past seven years, prided herself on her ability to sell anything, from fixer-uppers in Reynoldstown to modern masterpieces in Midtown. But this house...this house was proving to be her Everest. And today, she had a showing with the elusive Mr. and Mrs. Henderson, a young couple who were reportedly "extremely particular" about their future investments.

She checked her reflection in the polished brass of the front door, smoothing a stray strand of her auburn hair. This had to be the one. This had to be the showing that finally broke the curse of 12 Oak Haven Drive. Otherwise, she might just drown herself in a vat of sweet tea.
