Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a dietician named Amelia Willowbrook:

**Story Opening:**

The aroma of burnt toast and simmering desperation clung to the air in Amelia Willowbrook's tiny kitchen. She pinched the bridge of her nose, feeling the faint throb of a headache bloom. It was 6:00 AM, and her attempt at a "Power Breakfast Smoothie" had resulted in a congealed green mess that resembled something dredged from a swamp. Amelia, a registered dietician, whose professional life revolved around crafting perfect meal plans and preaching the gospel of balanced nutrition, couldn't seem to get her own damn breakfast right.

She stared at the offending concoction, a mixture of kale, chia seeds, and something questionably furry from the back of the freezer. "Maybe I should just have coffee," she muttered, knowing full well that caffeine would only exacerbate the anxiety knotting in her stomach. Today was the day. The day she faced her greatest professional challenge yet: taming the culinary chaos that was the Oakhaven Retirement Home.

**Setting:**

The story is primarily set in **Oakhaven Retirement Home**, a sprawling, slightly dilapidated facility perched on a windswept hill overlooking the coastal town of Seabrook, Maine. Oakhaven, once a grand Victorian mansion, had seen better days. The faded floral wallpaper peeled in the corners, the dining room chairs creaked with every movement, and the air perpetually smelled of lavender potpourri and something vaguely...institutional.

While much of the story unfolds within Oakhaven's walls – its dining hall, patient rooms, and Amelia's cramped office – the small coastal town of Seabrook also plays a significant role. It's a quintessential New England town with a picturesque harbor, a lighthouse casting its beam across the restless Atlantic, and a close-knit community that holds onto tradition with stubborn tenacity. Amelia finds solace in Seabrook's quieter corners, often walking the rocky beach to clear her head after a particularly challenging day at Oakhaven. The contrast between the vibrant life of the town and the sometimes-stagnant atmosphere of the retirement home underscores the themes of aging, community, and finding joy in the everyday.
