## Story Opening & Setting

**Setting:** The narrow alley behind "Bloom & Bumble," a thriving flower shop nestled in the heart of Charleston, South Carolina's historic French Quarter. Cobblestones, slick with the morning dew and stray flower petals, formed a mosaic beneath a wrought-iron balcony overflowing with cascading bougainvillea. The scent of jasmine and damp earth mingled with the faintest hint of garbage, a uniquely Charlestonian aroma that usually went unnoticed. Today, however, the stench seemed amplified, clinging to the air like a persistent shadow.

**Opening:**

Penelope Magnolia Dubois swore under her breath, her breath misting in the cool morning air. Usually, 6:00 AM found her elbows-deep in hydrangeas and her head buzzing with wedding color palettes. Today, though, she was elbow-deep in something far less appealing: a tangled mess of discarded ferns and inexplicably, a single, mud-caked stiletto heel. Penelope, a wisp of a woman with hair the color of dried lavender and a penchant for vintage dresses, straightened, wiping her hands on her apron. "This," she muttered to a particularly plump bumblebee buzzing around a nearby hibiscus, "is not how I envisioned starting my Thursday." The stiletto, though seemingly inconsequential, felt like a discordant note in the harmonious symphony of her life â€“ a life dedicated to the language of flowers, a language that usually spoke of beauty, hope, and above all, order. This stiletto, however, whispered of something else entirely. Something messy, something unsettling, something undeniably *wrong*.
