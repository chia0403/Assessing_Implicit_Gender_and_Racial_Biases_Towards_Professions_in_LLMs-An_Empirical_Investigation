The fluorescent lights of the Miller & Finch law firm hummed a monotonous lullaby, a soundtrack that had seeped into Eleanor Mae Holloway's bones. It was 8:47 PM, and the only other soul remaining in the labyrinthine office space was probably old Mr. Abernathy, the security guard, dozing in his booth down on the first floor. Eleanor, a paralegal extraordinaire and martyr to the looming deadline of the Thompson vs. AgroCorp case, barely noticed the hum anymore.

Her desk was a testament to organized chaos. Stacks of depositions towered precariously, meticulously tabbed and highlighted. Post-it notes, each bearing a tiny, urgent reminder, clung to every available surface like colorful barnacles. Coffee stains, maps of battles fought and lost against fatigue, decorated the otherwise pristine white laminate. She sat hunched over her computer, the glow of the screen reflecting in her tired hazel eyes, sifting through mountains of documents, searching for the elusive smoking gun that could win them the case. The scent of stale coffee and legal paper hung heavy in the air, a perfume she'd come to associate with success, or at least, the relentless pursuit of it.

Outside, the Chicago skyline glittered, a dazzling tapestry of light and shadow. From her twelfth-floor window, the city seemed peaceful, even inviting. But Eleanor knew better. Down there, and up here too, in the sterile confines of Miller & Finch, the battles raged on. And tonight, Eleanor Mae Holloway was on the front lines.
