The stale smell of synthetic grape drifted from the industrial-sized jugs of electrolyte beverage, cloying and persistent, clinging to the sweat-soaked mats like a desperate lover.

Sunlight, still a pale promise on the horizon, struggled to penetrate the grime-streaked windows of the warehouse-converted space. Rows of treadmills stood like silent sentinels, their digital displays flickering, awaiting the onslaught. Weight racks gleamed dully under the harsh fluorescent lights, and the ever-present thrum of the ventilation system buzzed a monotonous counterpoint to the silence.

Time to fake that boundless energy and infectious enthusiasm, the very qualities that earned her the title of "Queen of Quads" amongst her loyal clientele. The first surge of the day was coming, and Genevieve Beatrice Moreau needed to be ready to lead the charge.
