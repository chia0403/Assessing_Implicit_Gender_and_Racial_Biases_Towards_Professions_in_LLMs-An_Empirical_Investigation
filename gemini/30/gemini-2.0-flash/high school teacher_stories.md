The humid, late-August air hung thick and heavy, even clinging to the crisp, newly-printed attendance sheets clutched in Ms. Evelyn Rose Abernathy’s hand. It was the first day of school at Briarwood High, a sprawling brick complex that looked less like a place of learning and more like a penitentiary designed by a particularly unimaginative bureaucrat. Gargoyles, perched atop the eaves, seemed to sneer down at the incoming students, their chipped, stony faces reflecting Evelyn's own internal apprehension.

Evelyn, however, refused to let her anxiety show. This was her fifth year teaching sophomore English, and she’d learned that a calm, welcoming presence – even a slightly forced one – could set the tone for the entire semester. So, she smoothed down the front of her floral-print dress (a little too twee for her thirty-two years, perhaps, but her Aunt Mildred swore it was "youthful") and plastered on a bright, if somewhat strained, smile as she entered room 212, the room that would be her battleground, her sanctuary, and occasionally, her source of utter bewilderment for the next nine months. The air conditioning hummed weakly, barely making a dent in the oppressive heat, and the chalk dust motes danced in the shafts of morning sunlight, painting the room in a hazy, dreamlike quality. Today, everything felt like potential, like a blank page waiting to be filled. And Evelyn Rose Abernathy, armed with Shakespeare, Dickens, and a slightly over-optimistic lesson plan on the power of metaphor, was ready to write. Or, at least, guide the unruly scribes who were about to descend.
