The smell of stale Cheerios and industrial-strength disinfectant hung heavy in the air, a fragrant reminder of the battlefield that was the Caterpillar Corner classroom. Amelia Rose Hawthorne, all five-foot-three of her, surveyed the scene with a sigh. It was naptime, that sacred hour of relative peace, but even in the quiet, the aftermath of the morning’s chaos lingered. Crayons lay scattered like fallen soldiers across the construction paper-covered tables, a rogue pull-up peeked out from under a misshapen tower of blocks, and the faint but persistent hum of the fish tank did little to drown out the distant rumble of her impending headache.

Amelia straightened a crooked painting of a lopsided giraffe, its blue head nearly detached from its green body. The giraffe seemed to mock her. Five years. Five years she’d dedicated to wrangling tiny humans, to wiping noses and mediating disputes over shared toys, to singing the Wheels on the Bus so many times she could practically recite it in her sleep.

She glanced at the row of cots lined up in the dim, softly lit room. Ten little faces, each lost in their own miniature dream world. Ten little lives, each a tiny, pulsing responsibility. It was exhausting, yes. Underpaid, definitely. But then, sometimes, one of them would look at her with those wide, trusting eyes, and she’d remember why she did it.

Caterpillar Corner, a brightly painted, slightly dilapidated building on the edge of Harmony Creek, Pennsylvania, was a haven, a cacophonous, chaotic, and ultimately loving haven, and Amelia Rose Hawthorne, armed with her unwavering patience, a bottomless supply of hand sanitizer, and a secret stash of chocolate, was its unlikely guardian.
