Julian shivered, pulling his worn woolen scarf tighter around his neck. He was a man who built walls for a living, but tonight, he felt utterly exposed, vulnerable to the crushing weight of expectations riding on the building he was designing: The Tallinn Center for Sustainable Futures. His reputation, his future, and perhaps even the future of sustainable design in the Baltics, rested on the delicate lines etched across these fragile sheets of paper.
