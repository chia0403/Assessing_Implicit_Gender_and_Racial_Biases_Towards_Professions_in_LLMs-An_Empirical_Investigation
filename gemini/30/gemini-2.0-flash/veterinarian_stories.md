**Setting:** The biting wind whipped across the snow-covered fields of Harmony Creek, Montana, painting the sky in hues of bruised purple and defiant gold just before sunset. Harmony Creek wasn't much â€“ a scattering of weathered clapboard houses, a general store that doubled as the post office, a gas station perpetually humming with the scent of stale coffee, and Dr. Abigail Louise Carter's veterinary clinic, which was arguably the lifeblood of the entire community. The clinic, a modest log cabin built by Abigail's grandfather, was warm and inviting, with a crackling fireplace in the waiting room and the comforting aroma of disinfectant mingled with dog biscuits.

**Story Opening:**

The ringing phone sliced through the quiet hum of the clinic's generator like a butcher's knife. Abigail Louise Carter, perched precariously on a stool, was painstakingly stitching a small tear in the ear of a grumpy ginger tabby cat named Marmalade, who was currently attempting to disembowel her with tiny, needle-sharp claws. She swore under her breath, a gentle stream of words usually reserved for stubborn sutures and particularly recalcitrant cows.

"Hold that thought, Marmalade," she murmured, gently but firmly pinning the cat's back legs with her forearm. "We'll finish this masterpiece after I see who's desperate enough to call on a night like tonight."

With a final, deft knot, Abigail snipped the thread and deposited the disgruntled feline back in its carrier. She wiped her hands on her worn jeans and lunged for the phone, the rotary dial spinning with a familiar whir. "Harmony Creek Veterinary Clinic, Abigail Carter speaking." Her voice, though tired, was warm and reassuring. A little too reassuring, perhaps, for what the other end of the line had in store.
