## Story Opening:

The hum was insidious, a high-pitched whine that burrowed its way into Leo Maxwell's skull and refused to leave. He pressed the stethoscope's diaphragm harder against the chassis of the antique Philco Predicta, his brow furrowed in concentration. Outside, a torrential downpour hammered against the corrugated iron roof of his workshop, each blast of wind a percussive punctuation mark to the incessant electrical complaint. Leo, a smear of grease clinging stubbornly to his cheek, sighed and adjusted the miniature screwdriver in his other hand. This particular Predicta, all swooping fins and futuristic curves, belonged to Mrs. Hawthorne, the town's resident eccentric and self-proclaimed spiritual medium. She insisted the radio's malfunctioning speaker was a sign, a coded message from the other side, naturally. Leo just wanted to fix the damn thing and get paid.

## Setting:

Leo Maxwell's workshop, christened "Maxwell's Retro Waves" in a fit of optimistic branding that never quite caught on, was a crammed, chaotic space at the edge of Havenwood, Maine.  The small town, perpetually shrouded in mist and smelling of pine needles and damp earth, nestled deep in the heart of the state. The workshop itself was a converted garage, attached to a small, weather-beaten house with peeling paint and a perpetually overflowing woodpile. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of ozone, soldering flux, and dust that had settled undisturbed for decades.

Rows upon rows of radios lined the walls, a chronological graveyard of technological progress. Cathedrals, consoles, and portables stood shoulder to shoulder, some gleaming with restored glory, others skeletal and waiting for resurrection. Parts were strewn everywhere: tubes in cardboard boxes, resistors in labeled drawers, knobs and dials scattered like forgotten jewels. Leo, surrounded by his resurrected dinosaurs of sound, was in his element, a modern-day necromancer coaxing forgotten voices back to life.
