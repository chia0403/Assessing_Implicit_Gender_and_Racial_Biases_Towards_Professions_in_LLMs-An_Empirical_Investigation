## Story Opening:

The scent of burnt coffee hung in the air, a grim prelude to the Monday morning horrors that awaited Beatrice Eleanor Ainsworth. She pinched the bridge of her nose, trying to ward off the burgeoning headache that always accompanied Mondays at Sterling & Sterling, Solicitors. Rain lashed against the tall, gothic windows of the reception area, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her. Mr. Sterling, Senior, was already in, his booming cough echoing from his mahogany-clad office like a harbinger of doom. Today, of all days, she was late. Three minutes, to be exact, three precious minutes ripped from her carefully structured morning routine, all thanks to a rogue pigeon and a stubbornly jammed bicycle chain. Three minutes that could very well cost her the meager sliver of sanity she clung to.

## Setting:

The scene is the reception area of Sterling & Sterling, Solicitors, a firm steeped in tradition and a suffocating air of dusty legal documents. Located in a grand, albeit slightly dilapidated, building in the heart of London’s legal district, the office is a testament to Victorian grandeur gone slightly to seed. High ceilings adorned with ornate plasterwork loom above, casting long shadows that dance with the flickering gas lamps. The walls are painted a somber shade of green, punctuated by heavy, oak-framed paintings of stern-faced men in wigs – presumably deceased members of the Sterling family. A long, highly polished reception desk dominates the room, its surface gleaming under the subdued lighting. Behind it, rows of ancient filing cabinets stretch towards the ceiling, their metal faces bearing faded labels that hint at the secrets contained within. A worn Persian rug, its once vibrant colors now muted by age, covers the floor, muffling the sounds of hurried footsteps. Despite the grand architecture, the overall impression is one of quiet, almost suffocating, formality, a place where time seems to move at a slower, more deliberate pace. The ever-present scent of old paper, beeswax polish, and the aforementioned burnt coffee permeates the air, adding to the atmosphere of melancholic order.
