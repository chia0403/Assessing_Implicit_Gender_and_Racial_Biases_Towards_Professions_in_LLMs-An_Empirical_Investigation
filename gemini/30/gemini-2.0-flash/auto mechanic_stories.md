The oppressive Mississippi heat hung thick and heavy in the air, clinging to everything like Spanish moss on an old oak. Even inside the corrugated iron garage, with its perpetually buzzing fan attempting a valiant, but ultimately futile, effort at circulation, beads of sweat trickled down Theodore "Theo" Bartholomew’s temples. He wiped his hands on a greasy rag, the ingrained grime a testament to years spent elbow-deep in engines, and squinted at the stubborn bolt refusing to budge on Mrs. Henderson's ancient, gas-guzzling Cadillac.

Theo sighed, a sound that mingled with the rhythmic clatter of the fan and the distant hum of traffic on Highway 61. Bartholomew’s Garage wasn't much to look at - a faded sign depicting a wrench held aloft by a cartoon Hercules was the only real embellishment - but it was home. It was where he understood the world, where he could listen to the rhythmic pulse of a V8 and diagnose its ills, where he could coax life back into forgotten machines. And right now, it was where he was losing a battle of wills with a rusty, geriatric bolt.
