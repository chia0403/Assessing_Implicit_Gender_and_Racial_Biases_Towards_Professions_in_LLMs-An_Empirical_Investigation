Okay, here's a story opening, including the full name and description of our bell hop character and the setting:

**Story Opening**

The Plaza Astoria, all gleaming marble and hushed grandeur, was a mausoleum for the merely solvent. Mortimer Reginald Abernathy, his name a cruel joke considering the threadbare patches beginning to show on his perfectly pressed bellhop uniform, polished the brass luggage cart with a vigor that bordered on desperation. He'd been scrubbing the same smudge for the last five minutes.

It wasn't the smudge, of course. It was Mrs. Van Derlyn, with her poodle, Princess Fluffybutt III (the previous two having met unfortunate ends, one to a rogue vacuum cleaner, the other, tragically, to a runaway lobster), and her air of condescending disapproval. Mortimer could feel her gaze boring into the back of his neck, radiating the distinct heat of disdain. He knew what she was thinking: "Another Abernathy blemish on the impeccable surface of the Plaza." His family had been serving this hotel since its inception, and in recent years, the family name had been reduced to "that Abernathy kid who can't even keep his uniform pristine."

A glimmer of hope sparkled in the newly cleaned brass. A shiny black town car pulled up to the entrance, disgorging a woman draped in so much silk and mystery that she could have been royalty, or at least, a very well-funded spy. Mortimer straightened, smoothed his tie, and plastered a winning smile on his face, praying for a decent tip and a temporary reprieve from the Van Derlyn glare. Today, he hoped, would be a day where Mortimer Reginald Abernathy wasn't just another cog in the Plaza's well-oiled, and painfully boring, machine.

**Setting:**

*   **Location:** The Plaza Astoria, a grand, historic hotel in the heart of a major, bustling city (think New York, London, or Paris – your choice, depending on the tone you want to set).
*   **Time:** Present day.
*   **Atmosphere:** Luxurious, opulent, but also somewhat stuffy and steeped in tradition. There's a distinct undercurrent of wealth and privilege.
*   **Specific areas in play:** The grand lobby, with its marble floors, crystal chandeliers, and imposing reception desk, and the porte-cochère (covered entrance area) where guests arrive and depart.
*   **Key elements to visualize:** The contrast between the hotel's polished exterior and the subtly fraying edges of Mortimer's uniform; the imposing presence of the wealthy clientele; the quiet hum of activity that underlies the Plaza's carefully curated air of serenity.
