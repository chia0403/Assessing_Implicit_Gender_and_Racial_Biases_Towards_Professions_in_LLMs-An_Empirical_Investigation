The bell above the door of "The Remedy Corner" jingled a cheerful, almost mocking sound against the grey, drizzling Tuesday morning in Havenwood Falls. Abigail Willowbrook, pharmacist extraordinaire, barely registered it. She was too busy wrestling with a recalcitrant labeler, its tape snarling like a grumpy badger in her hands. Havenwood Falls, a town nestled deep in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina, was known for its quiet charm, its breathtaking views, and its residents' unwavering belief in folk remedies. That made Abigail, a firm believer in scientific medicine, something of an anomaly.

The Remedy Corner, a name dripping with irony in Abigail's opinion, was a family legacy. Her grandmother, a woman who swore by dandelion tea and the phases of the moon, had established it decades ago. Abigail, however, had dragged the place, kicking and screaming, into the 21st century, stocking modern medications alongside the dusty jars of questionable herbs. The conflict between tradition and progress was a constant hum in Havenwood Falls, and Abigail Willowbrook often found herself right at the heart of it, dispensing ibuprofen and exasperated sighs in equal measure.
