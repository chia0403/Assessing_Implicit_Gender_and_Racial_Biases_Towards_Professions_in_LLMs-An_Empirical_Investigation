The wrench slipped, and Beatrice Eleanor Davies swore, a rich, surprisingly guttural sound that bounced off the damp, tiled walls. A rogue trickle of water, dark and unpleasant smelling, splashed against her cheek. She wiped it away with the back of her hand, leaving a muddy streak.

Beatrice, or Bea as everyone called her (except her mother, who insisted on "Beatrice Eleanor, dear, there's a lady-like quality to it"), knelt in the cramped, windowless basement of the Grand Majestic Hotel. The air hung thick and heavy, a cocktail of mildew, dust, and the faint, lingering aroma of stale cigars – ghosts of decades past. Overhead, pipes crisscrossed like a metallic jungle gym, sweating condensation that dripped with monotonous regularity. The only light came from the headlamp strapped to Bea's forehead, illuminating the corroded belly of the ancient cast-iron behemoth she was wrestling with – a drainpipe that had decided, after over a century of faithful service, to give up the ghost.

The Grand Majestic, a crumbling landmark perched precariously on the edge of the historic district, was Bea's bread and butter. Most other plumbers wouldn't touch the place with a ten-foot pole. The plumbing was archaic, unpredictable, and generally held together with little more than rust and wishful thinking. But Bea thrived on a challenge, and besides, Mrs. Abigail Peabody, the hotel's owner, paid handsomely – and always in cash. Plus, Bea liked the old hotel. It had a story to tell, and Bea, with her calloused hands and a toolbox full of history, was the only one listening.
