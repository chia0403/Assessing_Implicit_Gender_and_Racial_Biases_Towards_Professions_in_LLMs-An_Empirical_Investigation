Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a concierge named Eleanor Ainsworth:

**Opening:**

Eleanor Ainsworth hated Tuesdays. Not in the fiery, curse-the-day-it-was-born sort of way, but with a quiet, simmering resentment, like forgetting a crucial ingredient in a meticulously planned soufflé. Tuesdays, in Eleanor's experience, were the day that meticulously planned lives began to unravel, revealing the sticky, often absurd, realities underneath. Today was proving no exception.

It started with Mrs. Vandergelt's missing pug, Mr. Snugglesworth III (yes, the third. Eleanor wondered if Mr. Snugglesworth I and II had met equally tragic or ridiculous ends). Then came the frantic call from Mr. Abernathy, who was, in Eleanor's estimation, entirely too reliant on her to find him a decent dry cleaner, claiming his "lucky silk paisley cravat" had been inexplicably stolen from his apartment. And now, as if the universe were playing some elaborate joke on her, the penthouse was being evacuated due to what smelled suspiciously like burnt popcorn.

Eleanor sighed, smoothing down the lapels of her navy blue concierge uniform. "Right, popcorn," she muttered to the polished mahogany desk, "because that's exactly what one expects at 9:17 AM on a Tuesday in the most exclusive residence in the city."

**Setting:**

The setting is the grand lobby of **The Belvedere Residences**, a luxury apartment building in the heart of **Manhattan's Upper East Side**. The lobby is opulent without being ostentatious, reflecting a timeless elegance. Think soaring ceilings, adorned with a subtly patterned gold-leafed molding, and a floor of meticulously laid Carrara marble. A crystal chandelier, its countless facets glinting in the morning light streaming through arched windows, hangs above.

Two oversized, plush velvet sofas flank a low, intricately carved coffee table displaying art books and fresh orchids. The walls are painted a soft, dove grey, providing a sophisticated backdrop for a rotating collection of contemporary art.

The focal point is the concierge desk, a custom-built piece of furniture crafted from rich mahogany, polished to a mirror sheen. Behind the desk, a bank of mailboxes gleam, each bearing the name of a resident in discreet gold lettering. A subtle scent of lilies and beeswax permeates the air, carefully chosen to evoke a sense of calm and understated luxury.

The Belvedere caters to an elite clientele – old money families, successful entrepreneurs, and celebrities seeking a sanctuary from the prying eyes of the public. Discretion is paramount, and Eleanor is the gatekeeper, the silent observer, the one who makes sure everything runs seamlessly, even when it's threatening to descend into complete chaos.
