The acrid smell of ozone and burnt plastic hung thick in the air, clinging to the back of Amelia "Amy" Sharma's throat. It wasn't a new smell; it was the familiar perfume of a bad wiring job, a sign that someone, somewhere, had gotten something horribly, dangerously wrong. Amy, her forehead beaded with sweat despite the cool November air rushing in from the open loading bay door, pulled down her safety goggles and muttered, "Okay, let's see what kind of mess we've got this time."

The setting was the sprawling warehouse of "Warehouse Wonders," a discount furniture and home goods store in the industrial outskirts of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The building itself was a metal behemoth, its corrugated iron exterior peeling like sunburnt skin. Inside, haphazardly stacked shelves stretched towards the dimly lit ceiling, overflowing with everything from cheap sofas upholstered in questionable fabrics to faux-antique chandeliers that looked more likely to fall than illuminate. Fluorescent lights flickered erratically overhead, casting long, distorted shadows that danced with the dust motes swirling in the air.

Amy, a wiry woman with calloused hands and a perpetually practical expression, worked for "Spark Solutions," a small, family-run electrical contractor. Warehouse Wonders was one of their regular clients, plagued by constant electrical issues thanks to a combination of shoddy original construction and even shoddier DIY repairs. This time, the problem was a newly installed row of security lights that had, according to the frantic store manager, gone “boom” just an hour before. As Amy navigated the maze of aisles, her tool belt clanking rhythmically against her worn jeans, she felt a familiar dread settle in her stomach. This felt like more than just a blown fuse. This felt like a potential fire hazard waiting to happen.
