**Story Opening:**

The fluorescent lights of the Tax Prep Emporium hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the frantic flurry of forms and frustrated sighs that characterized mid-March. Amelia Hernandez, her fingers stained with ink from countless W-2s and 1099s, took a deep breath and massaged the crick in her neck. Outside, a blustery wind rattled the windows, threatening to usher in the final dregs of winter. Inside, however, the atmosphere was thick with the anxiety of a looming deadline and the quiet desperation of people hoping for a sliver of fiscal relief.

**Setting:**

The Tax Prep Emporium, a low-slung building on the outskirts of Oakhaven, a small, blue-collar town in upstate New York. The interior is relentlessly practical, with rows of metal desks separated by flimsy partitions. The walls are a faded beige, punctuated by motivational posters depicting smiling families receiving massive tax refunds (Amelia secretly finds them condescending). Filing cabinets overflow with documents, and the air is thick with the scent of cheap coffee and paper dust. A waiting area, crammed with mismatched chairs and outdated magazines, sits just inside the entrance, a constant reminder of the human cost of tax season.
