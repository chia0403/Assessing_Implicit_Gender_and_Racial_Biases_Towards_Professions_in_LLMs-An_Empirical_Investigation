The chipped paint on the daycare walls, a faded, pastel swirl of lavender and peach, seemed to hum with a low, almost imperceptible thrum.  It was a sound Amelia "Amy" Cartwright couldn't quite place, but it was always there, a constant counterpoint to the relentless chatter of the children in her care.  Today, that chatter was especially frenzied, a cacophony of excited squeals and the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of tiny feet echoing against the polished linoleum floor.  Amy, with her perpetually tired but determined expression, surveyed the room.  A flurry of brightly colored craft projects, half-finished drawings, and abandoned blocks littered the space like a battlefield.  She was a seasoned child care worker at "Little Explorers," a brightly-painted, slightly ramshackle daycare situated on the edge of the bustling town of Oakhaven, known more for its antique shops and whispering willow trees than its vibrant energy.  Oakhaven's sleepy charm was an anomaly compared to the frenetic pace of the wider world. Amy, however, found a strange peace in the chaos.
