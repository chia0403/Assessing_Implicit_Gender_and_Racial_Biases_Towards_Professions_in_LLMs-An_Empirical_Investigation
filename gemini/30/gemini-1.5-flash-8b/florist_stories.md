The scent of jasmine, bruised peaches, and something faintly metallic hung heavy in the air of Amelia Nightingale's tiny shop, "Blooms by the Bay."  Sunlight, fractured by the grimy Victorian-era windows, painted shifting patterns across the neatly arranged floral displays.  Dust motes danced in the beams, illuminating the intricate designs of lilies and orchids, the vibrant scarlet of roses, and the delicate blush of peonies. Amelia, a woman whose fingers, stained a delicate shade of rose, were always busy arranging, carefully sculpted a cascade of forget-me-nots into a vase, her brow furrowed in concentration.  The rhythmic *plink* of the tiny bells above the shop door was the only sound besides the insistent hum of bees circling the honeysuckle vine clinging to the weathered brick wall outside.  Outside, the bustling harbour of Port Blossom, with its colourful fishing boats and the constant cry of gulls, was a symphony of life and movement, entirely absent within the calm sanctuary of Amelia's flower shop.
