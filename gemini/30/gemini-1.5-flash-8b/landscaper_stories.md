The biting wind whipped Amelia "Em" Hawthorne's crimson scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks like a thousand tiny needles.  The skeletal branches of the ancient oaks, gnarled and twisted like skeletal fingers clawing at the bruised sky, cast long, skeletal shadows across the meticulously manicured lawns of Blackwood Manor.  Even on this bleak November afternoon, the estate, nestled deep within the valley, exuded a chilling grandeur, a stark contrast to the warmth Em usually found in the vibrant green tapestry of her landscapes.

Em, a landscaper with fingers that seemed to understand the language of the earth, knelt beside a weathered stone fountain.  Ivy, once a verdant curtain, now hung like a tattered shroud, clinging to the mossy stonework.  The fountain, a relic of a bygone era, was choked with weeds, its once-clear basin now a muddy mirror reflecting the gray sky. This was her assignment: restore the neglected beauty, breathe life back into Blackwood Manor's dying soul.

Blackwood Manor wasn't just a place; it was a legend. Whispers followed Em as she approached, tales of the manor's dark history, of secrets buried beneath its layers of stone and whispers clinging to the ancient trees.  Local folklore claimed the house held a curse, one that only a true artist of the land could dispel. Em, however, was less interested in legends and more in the intricate dance of nature, the precise arrangement of a flowering rosebush, the way sunlight dappled the dew on a blade of grass.  But this particular challenge was different. It feltâ€¦ heavier.
