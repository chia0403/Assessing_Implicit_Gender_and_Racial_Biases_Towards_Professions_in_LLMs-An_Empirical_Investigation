The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Assured Futures" office hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Amelia Carmichael's fingers on the keyboard.  Rain hammered against the grimy windows, blurring the already hazy cityscape outside.  Amelia, a meticulous insurance agent with a shock of unruly auburn hair that seemed to defy the sterile atmosphere, hunched over her desk, the aroma of stale coffee and despair clinging to the air.  It was a Tuesday afternoon in late October, the kind that promised a week of unrelenting grey skies and even greyer prospects.  

Amelia, 32,  had spent the last three hours poring over the voluminous paperwork for the Blackwood family estate, a sprawling Victorian mansion on the edge of the city's decaying industrial district.  The estate, a relic of a bygone era, stood as a stark monument to both wealth and its eventual decay, an appropriate metaphor for the Blackwood family's current financial predicament. The insurance policy, inexplicably, seemed riddled with inconsistencies, as if deliberately designed to obfuscate rather than clarify.  A knot of unease tightened in her stomach, a familiar feeling that always preceded a truly tangled case.
