The chipped paint of the gazebo, peeling like sunburnt skin, mirrored the cracked asphalt of the drive.  Dust motes danced in the late afternoon sun, illuminating the skeletal branches of the ancient oak that dominated the sprawling grounds of Blackwood Manor.  A lone figure, Bartholomew "Barty" Finch, moved with the practiced grace of a seasoned dancer among the overgrown hedges.  Barty, 42, with a shock of unruly brown hair that seemed to absorb the surrounding grime, was the groundskeeper, the silent custodian of this decaying grandeur.  His calloused hands, stained a muted olive green, expertly trimmed a stubborn rose bush, its thorns a stark contrast to the velvety petals.  This was more than just a job; it was a sanctuary, a place where the whisper of rustling leaves and the scent of damp earth soothed the aching soul of a man haunted by a past he desperately tried to keep buried.
