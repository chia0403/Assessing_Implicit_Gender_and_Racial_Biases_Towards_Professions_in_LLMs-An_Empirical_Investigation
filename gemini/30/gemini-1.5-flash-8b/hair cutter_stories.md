The chipped paint of the barber's chair, a faded, pistachio green, felt oddly comforting against Elias Thorne's palm.  He traced the uneven edge with a thumb, the faint scent of lavender and old sweat clinging to the vinyl.  Outside, the sun beat down on the cobblestone streets of  Aethelgard, a city choked by towering, skeletal buildings of obsidian and polished ivory.  The air, thick with the smell of ozone and exhaust, hung heavy, mirroring the tension Elias felt coiled tight within his gut.  Today, a particularly important client was scheduled, one whose reputation preceded him like a phantom: Lord Valerius Blackwood, notorious for his demanding personality and even more demanding hair.

Elias Thorne, a barber with a reputation for precise cuts and a quiet, almost invisible presence, had never sought the spotlight.  But Blackwood's arrival, heralded by a retinue of footmen and the clatter of polished boots on the narrow alleyway, felt like a storm gathering on the horizon.  He knew the slightest misstep could shatter the delicate balance of his tiny shop, a sanctuary nestled within the heart of Aethelgard's tumultuous city.
