Rain lashed against the arched windows of the Institute for Applied Forensic Psychology, blurring the already muted grey light filtering in.  Dr. Eleanor Vance, her trench coat clinging damply to her frame, traced the condensation patterns on the glass with a finger.  The aroma of mildew and damp earth hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the sterile, almost clinical scent of the lab she'd just left.  The case of the "Silver Serpent" was proving far more disturbing than any textbook scenario.

The Institute, nestled in a secluded valley of the Pennine Hills, was a sprawling, gothic-style building.  Jagged stonework clawed at the sky, mirroring the jagged edges of the fractured memories Dr. Vance was piecing together.  Grey slate roofs, perpetually shrouded in a film of moisture, hinted at the secrets hidden within.  Towering pines, their branches bowed under the relentless rain, guarded the property, their needles whispering tales of the past.  The air itself seemed to hum with an unnerving stillness, a hush punctuated only by the ceaseless patter of rain and the rhythmic drip, drip, drip of water somewhere deep within the building.  Dr. Vance knew that the darkness she was facing wasn't just a collection of evidence; it was a tangible entity, waiting to be unearthed.
