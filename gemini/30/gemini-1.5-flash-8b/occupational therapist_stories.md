The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual grey-green from years of lukewarm water and forgotten soapsuds, reflected Amelia Hawthorne’s tired face.  Sunlight, weak and filtered through the grime-coated window of the community center’s occupational therapy room, cast long shadows across the cluttered table.  A stack of colourful therapy putty, a collection of oversized building blocks, and a half-finished puzzle depicting a vibrant but faded cityscape dominated the space.  Amelia, her name embroidered discreetly on the worn name tag of her faded navy-blue scrubs, sighed.  Another day, another mountain of paperwork, another patient needing more than just therapy tools.

The setting was a small, underfunded community center in the heart of a rapidly gentrifying neighbourhood.  Once a vibrant hub for diverse families, the community center felt increasingly isolated and overlooked as the trendy boutiques and artisanal coffee shops crept further down the street.  The scent of stale coffee and damp plaster hung in the air, a familiar comfort and a constant reminder of the struggle between preserving community and bowing to progress.  Amelia, a seasoned occupational therapist with a gentle, compassionate nature, knew this community’s story intimately, and the unspoken anxieties of its residents were etched into the very fabric of the building itself.
