The chipped porcelain of the antique teacup trembled in Amelia Cavendish's hand, mirroring the tremor in her chest.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the high, arched windows of the Whispering Walls Library.  This library, a gothic masterpiece nestled deep within the shadowed heart of Blackwood Manor, was her sanctuary, her world, and now, her inescapable problem.  

The setting was a perpetual twilight within the library. Sunlight, fractured and pale, cast long, dancing shadows across the towering bookshelves, filled with leather-bound volumes and whispered secrets.  Dust motes, perpetually suspended in the still air, swirled like tiny specters.  The grand, echoing hall, its walls adorned with faded tapestries depicting forgotten lore, smelled faintly of aged paper and something akin to pine, a scent that always intensified on the eve of a storm.  Dampness clung to the stone floors, a cold breath seeping from the ancient stonework.  A low, mournful hum, like the sigh of a dying giant, emanated from the very heart of the library, always seeming just out of earshot.  Blackwood Manor itself, the home of the library, was a brooding presence, draped in an atmosphere of hushed mystery. The air vibrated with an almost palpable sense of history, a history Amelia, as the library's sole keeper, felt herself increasingly bound to.
