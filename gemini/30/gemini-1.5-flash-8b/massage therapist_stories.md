Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Willow Creek Massage Parlour, a rhythmic drumming that mirrored the frantic thrumming in Elara Nightingaleâ€™s chest.  The small, dimly lit room, smelling faintly of lavender oil and something indefinably earthy, felt more like a pressure cooker than a haven.  Sunlight, fractured and weak, barely pierced the grime-coated windows, casting long, dancing shadows across the cluttered space.  A single, flickering fluorescent bulb hung precariously above a worn, wooden table, illuminating dust motes swirling in the humid air.  Elara, a young woman with eyes the colour of stormy seas and hands that knew the language of muscles, adjusted the heavy silk sheet draped over a new client, trying to ignore the persistent anxiety knotting in her stomach. Outside, the rhythmic drumming continued, a relentless soundtrack to the unspoken anxieties within the walls of her small business.
