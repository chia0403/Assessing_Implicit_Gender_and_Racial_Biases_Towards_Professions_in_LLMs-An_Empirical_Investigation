The aroma of freshly brewed coffee and sugared almonds hung heavy in the air of "Sweet Surrender," a tiny bakery tucked between a bustling bookstore and a quirky antique shop on the cobbled streets of Old Oakhaven.  Rain hammered against the ornate, ivy-covered windowpanes, blurring the already-dim light filtering in.  Inside, Amelia Cavendish, a young woman with fiery red hair pulled back in a tight bun and eyes that seemed to sparkle even in the muted light, meticulously piped a delicate swirl of buttercream frosting onto a miniature wedding cake.  Each precise stroke of her palette knife was accompanied by a soft hum of concentration, a counterpoint to the rhythmic pitter-patter of the rain.  Amelia, with her apron stained with the colours of edible gold and vibrant blues, was in her element, lost in the artistry of sugar and the quiet magic of creation.
