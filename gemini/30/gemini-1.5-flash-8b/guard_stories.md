The biting wind howled a mournful dirge across the skeletal remains of the city, a symphony of ice and shattered stone.  Dust, the colour of dried blood, swirled around Elara Thorne, Guard of the Western Gate, stinging her eyes and coating her leather jerkin with a fine, gritty film.  The once-grand city of Aethelgard lay in ruins, its towering spires reduced to jagged, fractured monuments to a forgotten glory.  Forged in the crucible of a devastating war, Elara’s world now consisted of grey and desolate landscapes, broken promises, and the constant, unsettling creak of the crumbling walls around her.

The Western Gate, her post for the past three years, was more a tomb than a gateway.  A single flickering torch, perched precariously on a splintered pillar, cast long, dancing shadows that seemed to mock her vigil.  The rusted iron gates, once imposing and majestic, were now dented and scarred, bearing the marks of countless battles.  Beyond them, the endless expanse of the Whispering Wastes stretched into the encroaching twilight, a vast, unexplored ocean of despair, whispered to hold dangers more fearsome than any that dared trespass the fractured city walls.  A chill, deeper than the wind, settled in Elara’s bones, a foreboding that resonated with the echoes of the past.
