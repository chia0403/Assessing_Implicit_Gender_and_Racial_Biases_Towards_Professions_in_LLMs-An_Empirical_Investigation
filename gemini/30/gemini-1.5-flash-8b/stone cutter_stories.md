The biting wind whipped across the craggy peaks of the Silvan Mountains, stinging Elara Stonehand's cheeks as she hammered at the stubborn grey stone.  Dust, fine as powdered starlight, swirled around her, obscuring the already dim light filtering through the jagged, snow-capped peaks.  The air hung thick with the scent of pine needles and damp earth, a stark contrast to the acrid tang of stone dust that clung to everything.  Elara, her name echoing the hardness of the mountain she carved from, was alone, as she always was, in the hidden quarry of Whisperwind.  The echoing clang of her hammer was the only sound besides the wind's mournful cry, a lonely symphony played out against the backdrop of ancient, silent stone.

Whisperwind quarry, nestled deep within the Silvan Mountains, was a labyrinth of tunnels and caverns carved out by generations of stone cutters.  Sunlight rarely dared to penetrate the dense canopy of pines, casting an eternal twilight over the subterranean workings.  Rough-hewn wooden scaffolding, groaning under the weight of the quarry's formidable stone, supported the precarious walkways.  Ancient, weathered carvings, depicting long-forgotten gods and beasts, adorned the walls, silent witnesses to centuries of toil and sweat.  The very air crackled with a palpable sense of history, a tangible presence of the mountain itself, watchful and immutable.
