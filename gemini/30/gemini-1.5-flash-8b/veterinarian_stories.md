The biting wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vance’s auburn hair across her face as she wrestled the stubborn Labrador retriever, Max, into the examination room.  The old Victorian house, nestled precariously on the edge of the Whispering Woods, groaned under the relentless onslaught of the November storm.  Rain lashed against the leaded-glass windows, obscuring the already dim interior, and the air, thick with the smell of pine needles and damp earth, clung to her like a second skin.  Max, a magnificent beast of a dog with fur the colour of melted chocolate, whined and struggled, his large brown eyes reflecting the flickering gaslight.  Eleanor, despite the discomfort, felt a surge of quiet determination.  Tonight, Max needed her.  

This wasn't just any vet visit. This was the Whispering Woods Veterinary Clinic, a practice Eleanor had inherited from her estranged grandfather, a legendary naturalist and animal healer, a man who had whispered of secrets held deep within the forest's heart. Eleanor, who’d long ago rejected the mystical aspects of his work, now found herself drawn into a mystery that felt inextricably bound to the unsettling murmur of the woods.  The unsettling whispers had already begun, following close behind the chill wind.
