The brass bell, a mocking echo in the cavernous lobby, clanged a mournful symphony as Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, a bell hop at the Grand Imperial Hotel, polished a brass tray with the obsessive zeal of a sculptor.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the high windows, illuminating the swirling patterns of the intricate parquet floor, a testament to a grandeur that felt both suffocating and strangely comforting.  The Grand Imperial, a monument to faded opulence, stood sentinel over the sprawling, rain-slicked city of Aethelgard, its towering facade a gothic masterpiece rendered in weathered stone and stained glass that seemed to weep with the perpetual dampness of the northern coast.  A chill, sharper than the November air, settled over Barty, a persistent thrumming in his chest that had little to do with the biting wind whistling through the gaps in the ornately carved window frames.  He traced a tiny, almost imperceptible scratch on the tray with his fingertip.  It was a new mark, an unwelcome guest in the meticulously maintained shine.
