The fluorescent lights of the truck stop diner hummed, a monotonous counterpoint to the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Jasper "Jax" Blackwood's heart.  He stared at the greasy spoon's chipped Formica, the faded floral wallpaper a stark contrast to the vibrant, almost hallucinatory colours swirling in his head.  His rig, the "Ironclad," a battered but loyal 18-wheeler, sat gleaming under the pale morning light a few yards away, its engine idling like a restless beast.  Jax, a man whose weathered face held the map of countless highways, was a seasoned trucker, but tonight, something felt different.  The air itself seemed to vibrate with unspoken anxieties.

Setting:  Dust Bowl, Arizona.  The year is 2024.  The once-fertile plains of the American Southwest are now a desolate landscape of cracked earth and scrub brush, a grim testament to years of drought and over-farming.  Scattered ghost towns, their skeletal remains poking through the parched earth, serve as silent reminders of a time when life and commerce flourished on this route.   The interstate, the only artery connecting the parched towns and dying farms to the distant promise of water, is a highway of hope and despair.  The truck stops, once bustling hubs of activity, now struggled for sustenance, their owners trying to eke out a living as the region slowly suffocates.  A palpable sense of fragility hangs over the land, a weight matching the anxiety in Jax's chest.
