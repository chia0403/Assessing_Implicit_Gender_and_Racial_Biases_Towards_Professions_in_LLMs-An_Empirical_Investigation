The biting wind whipped Amelia "Ash" Ashworth's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks like a thousand tiny needles.  Below, the cobblestones of the ancient, winding alley groaned under the weight of the freezing rain.  She hunched deeper into her worn leather jacket, her breath puffing out in white clouds against the backdrop of the looming, grey cathedral.  Today, her tour group, a gaggle of boisterous American tourists, were scheduled to enter the cathedral's crypt, a place Ash knew intimately, yet one she felt a palpable unease about.  Their pre-tour briefing had gone surprisingly smoothly, but a persistent, unsettling feeling, like a cold hand gripping her heart, had settled in since.  This wasn't just any crypt.  This was the Whispering Walls, and whispers, Ash knew, could take on a life of their own.

The setting:  A medieval European city, steeped in history and shrouded in an almost palpable melancholia.  Narrow, winding alleyways, the scent of damp earth and aged stone permeated the air.  The imposing cathedral, a towering monument of gothic architecture, loomed over the city, its spires reaching towards a perpetually overcast sky.  Above the city, a perpetual twilight made the city's cobblestone streets seem to glow with a muted, ethereal light.  Inside the cathedral, the crypt's air hung thick with the damp chill of centuries.  Chiseled stone walls, adorned with intricate carvings and faded frescoes, whispered tales of long-dead kings and queens, their fates interwoven with the very stones they touched.
