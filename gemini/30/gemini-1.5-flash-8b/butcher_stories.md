The scent of blood, sharp and metallic, clung to the air in the shadowed alleyway, a constant companion to Bartholomew "Barty" Grimshaw.  It wasn't the blood of a recent kill, but a lingering memory, a testament to the relentless rhythm of his life as a butcher in the sprawling, rain-slicked city of Aethelgard.  Brick buildings, perpetually coated in grime and soot, pressed in on him, their windows like vacant eyes staring down at the shadowed alley where he'd set up shop.  The faint glow of streetlights painted the cobblestones in a sickly yellow, casting long, skeletal shadows that danced with the drizzle.  A chill wind whistled through the gaps in the crumbling buildings, carrying the cries of vendors and the distant rumble of carts rattling along the main thoroughfare. This was Barty's domain, a grim but familiar realm where the scent of death and the promise of sustenance mingled in a perpetual dance.
