The fluorescent lights of the economy class cabin hummed a monotonous lullaby, a soundtrack to Amelia Kensington's third flight of the day.  The air, recycled and faintly smelling of stale coffee and anxiety, clung to her like a second skin.  Outside, the vast expanse of the Atlantic Ocean blurred into an inky smear, punctuated only by the occasional, distant flicker of a city light.  Amelia, a flight attendant with the impeccably-named Celestial Airways, smoothed the wrinkles out of her crisp navy uniform, her reflection staring back from the polished metal of the galley.  Her nametag, gleaming almost perversely in the subdued illumination, read "Amelia Kensington â€“ Flight Attendant 47".  

The setting was Flight 214, a transatlantic route from London Heathrow to New York JFK, a journey she'd made countless times over the past five years.  The cabin, normally bustling with the chatter of passengers and the clinking of cutlery, was eerily quiet this evening.  The low hum of the engines, amplified by the almost palpable silence, seemed to whisper secrets about the unseen forces at play.   A thick layer of pre-dawn mist clung to the windows, obscuring the approaching horizon, mirroring the heavy silence Amelia felt in her heart. The scent of lavender, a calming balm she often carried, seemed almost mocking in its tranquility.
