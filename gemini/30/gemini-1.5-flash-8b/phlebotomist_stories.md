The fluorescent hum of the lab was a constant, low thrumming, punctuated only by the rhythmic *thwap* of Dr. Amelia Petrova's gloved fingers against the plastic vial caps.  Sunlight, fractured and pale, sliced through the grimy windowpanes, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air.  Amelia, a phlebotomist at the perpetually understaffed, perpetually underfunded City General Hospital, sighed, the sound swallowed by the sterile machinery.  Another Tuesday. Another deluge of paperwork and blood samples.

The lab, located in a cramped basement beneath the bustling emergency department, felt like a forgotten annex, a subterranean world illuminated by the weak, sickly glow of the fluorescent lights.  The air hung thick with the smell of antiseptic and the faint, metallic tang of dried blood.  Rows of metal cabinets, overflowing with vials and antiquated equipment, lined the walls, creating a claustrophobic atmosphere that pressed in on the already-frazzled staff.  A faint, cloying aroma of cleaning solution clung to the air, mixing with the residual scent of fear and desperation that permeated the waiting area above.
