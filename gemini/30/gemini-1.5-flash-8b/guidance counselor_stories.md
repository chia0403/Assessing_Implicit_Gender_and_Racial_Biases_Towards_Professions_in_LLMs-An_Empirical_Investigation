Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the Northwood High guidance office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Amelia Blackwood, a guidance counselor with a heart of storm clouds.  The fluorescent lights hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Amelia’s increasingly frantic drumming fingers on the worn oak desk.  Paperclips skittered across the surface, a metallic counterpoint to the mounting pressure.  Around her, the hushed whispers of teenage anxieties echoed – the fear of failure, the weight of expectations, the blurry confusion of adolescence.

The damp chill clinging to the air seemed to seep into her very bones, reflecting the oppressive atmosphere in the room.  Outside, the ancient oak trees in the school's courtyard, usually majestic and strong, were bowed low under the relentless downpour.  This was the day everything went wrong.
