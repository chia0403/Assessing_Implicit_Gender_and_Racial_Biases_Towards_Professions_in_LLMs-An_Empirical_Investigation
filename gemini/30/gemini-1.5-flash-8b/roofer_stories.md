The rain hammered against the corrugated iron of the dilapidated barn, a frantic tattoo against the pre-dawn gloom.  Jasper "Jax" Blackwood, a roofer with hands calloused like ancient maps and eyes the colour of stormy seas, hauled himself onto the rusted metal ladder.  He inhaled the sharp tang of damp earth and the acrid smell of something burning, probably a discarded cigarette from some late-night revelry in the neighbouring town of Oakhaven.  The wind howled a mournful dirge through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks that surrounded the property, twisting the flickering gas lamp in his hand until it almost went out.  His destination: the crooked, weather-beaten roof of the Blackwood Manor, a sprawling gothic monstrosity with a history as dark as the shadowed valleys around it. This wasn't just any roof job; this was personal.
The setting: Blackwood Manor, a crumbling estate overlooking the misty valley of Oakhaven, nestled deep within the jagged peaks of the Whispering Mountains.  Twisted oaks, draped in moss and mist, surrounded the vast, decaying mansion. The air was thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, the silence punctuated only by the whispering wind and the relentless drumming of rain against the weathered shingles.  A palpable sense of history and forgotten secrets clung to the very stones of the manor, and Jax, despite his rough-hewn exterior, felt it pressing in on him.
