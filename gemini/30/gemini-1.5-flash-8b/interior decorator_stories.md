The scent of aged parchment and linseed oil hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma to Amelia Hawthorne, Interior Designer.  Sunlight, fractured by the stained-glass window depicting a scene of swirling, impossible flora, painted shifting patterns across the dusty mahogany floor of her workshop.  It was a space she'd inherited from her grandmother, a woman renowned for her exquisite taste and even more exquisite eccentricities.  Amelia, though a modern decorator with a flair for clean lines and sophisticated palettes, found comfort in the cluttered room's whispers of the past.  Each chipped teacup, each tarnished silver trinket, each faded watercolour sketch felt like a secret, waiting to be unearthed, much like the secrets she hoped to uncover within her latest commission.

The grand estate, a sprawling Tudor manor nestled deep within the whispering woods of Blackwood Manor, was Amelia's current project.  The owner, the enigmatic Lady Beatrice Blackwood, had commissioned Amelia to transform her house into a haven of calm and serenity, a stark contrast to the rumours that circulated about her volatile temper and shrouded past.  The estate itself seemed to absorb the sounds of the surrounding forest, whispering tales of ancient rituals and forgotten histories.  Jagged peaks of dark pines, shrouded in a perpetually damp mist, framed the mansion's grey stone walls, their silence a stark counterpoint to Amelia's restless energy.  The sheer size of the property, the palpable sense of history and the mystery surrounding Lady Beatrice had Amelia buzzing with a potent mixture of excitement and apprehension.
