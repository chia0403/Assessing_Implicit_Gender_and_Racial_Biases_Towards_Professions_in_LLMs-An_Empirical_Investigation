The Arizona sun beat down mercilessly on the desolate expanse surrounding the vast, empty quarry.  Scraggly,  almost skeletal, mesquite trees stood sentinel, their branches reaching like gaunt fingers toward a sky the colour of burnt umber.  The air hung thick and still, promising another sweltering day in the heart of the parched desert.
