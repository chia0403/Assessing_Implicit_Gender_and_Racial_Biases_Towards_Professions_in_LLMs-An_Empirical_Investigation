The biting November wind whipped across the exposed steel skeleton of the new skyscraper, whistling a mournful tune through the scaffolding.  Rain, the colour of pewter, slicked the metal, and a chill, deeper than the air, settled in Amelia "Milly" Blackwood's bones.  She tugged at the frayed collar of her waterproof jacket, the familiar ache in her shoulder a constant reminder of the pre-dawn concrete pour.  Milly, 32 years old, with the weathered hands of a seasoned construction worker and eyes that held the muted grey of a November sky, was already halfway through her shift at the Zenith Tower project in the heart of downtown Metropolis.  This was her life:  a relentless ballet of steel and concrete, punctuated by the rhythmic clang of hammers and the ever-present threat of falling debris.

The setting was the Zenith Tower construction site, a colossal project rising from the heart of downtown Metropolis.  Towering cranes scraped the bruised blue sky, their metal arms like skeletal fingers reaching for the clouds.  The air thrummed with the ceaseless roar of machinery â€“ jackhammers, generators, the low growl of powerful concrete mixers.  Construction workers, figures in their distinctive orange safety vests, swarmed like ants across the intricate web of scaffolding.  The surrounding city, a labyrinth of steel and glass, watched on from its elevated vantage points, oblivious to the quiet struggle taking place in its shadows.  Dust motes danced in the pale light filtering through the clouds, creating a hazy atmosphere that painted the cityscape in muted tones.  A stark contrast to the sheer scale and ambition of the skyscraper itself.
