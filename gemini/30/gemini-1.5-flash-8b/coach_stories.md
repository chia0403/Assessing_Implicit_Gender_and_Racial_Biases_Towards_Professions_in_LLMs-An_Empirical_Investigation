Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the dilapidated community centre, a relentless drumming that mirrored the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Amelia Kensington's heart.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and stale gym socks, hung heavy in the cavernous space.  Dust motes danced in the single, flickering fluorescent light above, illuminating the scattered remnants of yesterday's basketball practice â€“ sweat-stained jerseys, discarded water bottles, and a lone, deflated basketball lying forlornly in a corner.  Amelia, her worn tracksuit soaked through, surveyed the scene.  This wasn't just any community centre.  It was the heart of Willow Creek, a place where dreams, as fragile as autumn leaves, often withered before they had a chance to blossom.  And Amelia, the fiercely dedicated basketball coach, was determined to keep those flickering flames alive.  Tonight, however, the flames seemed almost extinguished.
