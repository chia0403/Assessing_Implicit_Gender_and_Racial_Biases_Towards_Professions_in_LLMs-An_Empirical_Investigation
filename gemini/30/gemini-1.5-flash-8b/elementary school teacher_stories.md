The chipped paint on the classroom door, a faded shade of avocado green, seemed to sigh with the afternoon humidity.  Sunlight, fractured and filtered through the dusty windowpanes, painted a kaleidoscope of yellow and orange across the worn linoleum floor.  Amelia Katherine Finch, a third-grade teacher with eyes the colour of a stormy sea and a perpetually tired smile, adjusted her glasses and surveyed the scene.  Twelve pairs of eyes, a kaleidoscope of unruly colours, stared back at her from behind a riot of brightly coloured construction paper, half-finished drawings, and overflowing bins of discarded crayons.  It was a typical Tuesday afternoon in Mrs. Finch's third-grade classroom at Oakhaven Elementary School â€“ a microcosm of chaos beautifully contained within the confines of a beige-walled room.
