Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, a relentless drumming that mirrored the persistent ache in Elara Nightingaleâ€™s shoulders.  The small, unassuming building, tucked away on a side street in the heart of the sprawling, industrial city of Veridia, hummed with a low, damp energy.  Dust motes danced in the pale light filtering through the grimy windows, illuminating the sterile, yet slightly cluttered, space.  Rows of exercise equipment, gleaming with a faint, almost ghostly sheen, stood silent sentinels.  Elara, a physical therapist with a practiced eye and an even more practiced touch, surveyed the room, her gaze falling on a figure slumped over a worn exercise ball.  It was a familiar sight, a symptom of Veridia's relentless pace.  The city, a concrete jungle pulsing with the constant thrum of machinery and the muted roar of traffic, exacted a toll on its inhabitants.  Elara knew the toll firsthand.  Each session was a delicate dance between easing pain and understanding the forces that shaped a life, both physically and emotionally.
