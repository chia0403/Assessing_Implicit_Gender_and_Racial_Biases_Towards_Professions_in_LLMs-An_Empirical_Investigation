The chipped paint of the easel, a faded cerulean blue, mirrored the bruised sky outside.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the studio, a relentless percussion that drowned out the rhythmic click-clack of Amelia Blackwoodâ€™s brush against canvas.  Amelia, a painter of the forgotten corners of the city, hunched over her latest creation, a swirling vortex of grey and charcoal representing the forgotten alleyways behind the Grand Central Market.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom, illuminating the intricate network of buildings, each brick a whispered story waiting to be unearthed.  The air, thick with the smell of linseed oil and damp earth, hung heavy in the cramped space, a claustrophobic symphony of muted colours and unfinished dreams.  The setting sun, a dull orange disc, painted the city in shades of grey and deepening violet.   A lone streetlamp flickered, casting long, distorted shadows across the studio floor.
