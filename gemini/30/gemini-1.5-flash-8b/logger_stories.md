The biting wind, a relentless, icy claw, ripped at the faded flannel shirt clinging to Elias Thorne, the seasoned logger.  Snow, the consistency of powdered glass, stung his cheeks and frosted the thick beard that framed his weathered face.  He squinted at the skeletal branches of the ancient pines that clawed at the bruised sky, their skeletal fingers reaching like skeletal hands towards the impending twilight.  The air, thick with the smell of pine needles and the metallic tang of aged blood, hung heavy over the remote logging camp, nestled deep within the unforgiving heart of the Cascadian wilderness.  A fire crackled merrily in the hearth of the rough-hewn cabin, its orange glow the only warmth in the encroaching chill.  Elias, his breath puffing out in white plumes, stared into the flames, the rhythmic pop and crackle a stark contrast to the eerie silence of the surrounding forest.  He knew, with a certainty that settled deep in his bones, that tonight, something was different.  Not just the biting wind or the inky darkness beginning to consume the forest, but a shift in the very essence of the wilderness.  A disturbance.  And Elias, despite the years spent battling the unforgiving nature of the woods, felt an unsettling sense of dread creeping over him.
