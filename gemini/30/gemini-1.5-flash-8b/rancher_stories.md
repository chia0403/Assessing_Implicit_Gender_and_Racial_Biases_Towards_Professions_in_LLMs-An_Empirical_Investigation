The wind, a relentless, whispering coyote, whipped across the parched plains, tugging at the faded denim of Silas Blackwood.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of ochre and grit, danced across the cracked earth, mirroring the turmoil in his chest.  Silas Blackwood, rancher of the Sunstone Ranch, stared out at the desolate landscape.  Heâ€™d inherited this vast, unforgiving stretch of land, a legacy of sun-scorched canyons and wind-carved mesas, ten years ago.  Ten years of relentless drought, of dwindling cattle, and the gnawing fear that the sun would one day swallow the last drop of water.

The setting sun, a molten orb sinking below the jagged skyline, painted the sky in hues of blood orange and bruised purple.  This was the heart of the Arizona desert, where the heat hung heavy, a suffocating blanket over the parched earth.  Broken, skeletal trees clawed at the sky, their gnarled branches reaching out like skeletal hands, begging for rain.  The only sound besides the wind was the faint, almost imperceptible, bleating of a lost lamb somewhere beyond the horizon.  Silas felt a familiar knot of dread tighten in his stomach.  The lamb... it was just another casualty in this relentless battle against the elements.  And a bad omen for the future of Sunstone Ranch.
