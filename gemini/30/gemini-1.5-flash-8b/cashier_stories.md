The fluorescent lights of the "Super Saver" grocery store hummed, a monotonous drone that perpetually echoed through the aisles.  Dust motes danced in the shafts of pale light filtering through the grimy, chipped windows, painting swirling patterns on the linoleum floor.  Amelia Rosewater, a cashier with a perpetually tired smile and eyes that held the weight of countless shopping carts, tapped furiously at the register.  Today's deluge of Tuesday specials had made the checkout lines stretch further than ever, each customer a miniature mountain of produce, packaged meats, and sugary cereal boxes.  A persistent scent of stale coffee and slightly-burnt popcorn hung heavy in the air, a familiar backdrop to Amelia's already-overburdened day.  Outside, a relentless drizzle hammered against the storefront, mirroring the steady rhythm of the ringing cash register.
