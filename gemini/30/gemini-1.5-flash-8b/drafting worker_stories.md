The fluorescent hum of the drafting room was a constant, low thrumming against Elara Blackwood's ears.  Dust motes danced in the pale light filtering through the grimy windowpanes, mirroring the swirling chaos in her mind.  She stared at the meticulously detailed blueprint spread across her drafting table, a sprawling diagram of the proposed "Skyspire Apartments," a project that felt more like a monument to ambition than a practical dwelling.  Each line, each carefully measured curve, felt alien, divorced from the tangible reality of her own life.

Elara Blackwood, 27, was a drafting worker, a cog in the intricate machine of urban development.  Her fingers, stained a perpetual sepia from years of graphite and ink, moved with a practiced efficiency that masked the gnawing unease within.  Outside the window, the city clawed its way upwards, a concrete jungle erupting into a tapestry of steel and glass.  Inside the cramped, airless drafting room, the only sounds were the click of her mechanical pencil, the rustle of blueprints, and the distant, rhythmic clang of construction elsewhere in the city. This wasn't her vision, not her life.  This was a life drawn by someone else, and she was merely the one translating their dreams onto paper.
