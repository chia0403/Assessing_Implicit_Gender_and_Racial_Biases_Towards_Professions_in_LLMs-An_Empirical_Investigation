The chipped porcelain of the sink, a faded robin's egg blue, felt cold against Elara Seraphina Nightingale's fingertips.  Rain hammered against the expansive plate-glass windows of the Grand Elysian Hotel, mirroring the relentless drumming in her temples.  The scent of wet asphalt and petrichor, usually a comforting city symphony, tonight felt like a mournful dirge.  Elara, the Grand Elysianâ€™s resident concierge, stared out at the churning grey sky.  It was the kind of evening that whispered of clandestine meetings, secret affairs, and perhaps, just perhaps, a missing diamond necklace.

The Grand Elysian, perched atop a hill overlooking the sprawling metropolis of Aethelgard, was a monument to opulence.  Its facade, a gleaming ivory, shimmered with the reflected light of a thousand hidden spotlights.  Inside, the hushed conversations of the elite echoed through marble corridors and whispered through ornate doorways.  Each guest room was a miniature kingdom, complete with bespoke furnishings and private balconies overlooking the city lights.  But tonight, the usually vibrant pulse of the hotel was subdued, shrouded in an unnerving quiet.  Elara, however, knew the quiet was never truly empty.  It was a stage whisper, hinting at the drama about to unfold.
