The flickering neon sign of "Apothecary's Bloom" cast a sickly yellow glow across the rain-slicked cobblestones of Alderwood.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and woodsmoke, clung to Amelia Blackwood, a pharmacist with eyes the colour of bruised plums and hands perpetually stained a delicate shade of sage green.  It was a Tuesday night, the kind that held a chill even the roaring fireplace in the shop couldn't quite dispel.  Tonight, the usual quiet hum of the apothecary was amplified by a low, insistent drumming echoing from the alleyway behind.  Amelia, her brow furrowed, adjusted the spectacles perched precariously on her nose and pushed a stray lock of dark hair back from her face.  The drumming persisted, an irregular pulse against the rhythmic drip, drip, drip of the ancient, iron-laced eaves.  This was not the usual nocturnal racket of Alderwood.  This was...different.
