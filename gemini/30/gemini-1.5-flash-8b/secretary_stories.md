The chipped Formica countertop gleamed under the harsh fluorescent lights of the Sterling & Stone law firm, reflecting Amelia Butterfield’s perpetually weary expression.  The air, thick with the scent of stale coffee and over-printed legal documents, felt almost tangible.  Amelia, a secretary of meticulous habits and even more meticulous paperwork, meticulously alphabetized a stack of eviction notices, the rhythmic *thwack* of the plastic dividers against the manila folders the only sound besides the occasional muffled intake of breath from the lawyers hunched over their desks in the adjacent offices.

The city, a concrete jungle of towering skyscrapers and grinding traffic, swirled outside the high-rise window of Sterling & Stone, its gritty charm hidden beneath a shroud of industrial smog. Inside, the atmosphere was a stark contrast, a contained world of legal maneuvering and whispered strategies. Amelia, however, found herself staring out the window, her thoughts straying from the endless cycle of paperwork to the looming shadow of a new case – a case involving a property on the crumbling edge of the city, a case that smelled of something far more sinister than standard real estate dispute.
