Rain hammered against the slate roof of the dilapidated theatre, a relentless drumming that mirrored the frantic rhythm in Amelia "Milly" Nightingale's chest.  The air hung thick with the scent of mildew and old papier-mâché, clinging to the faded velvet curtains like a shroud.  Milly, a theatrical director known for her audacious interpretations and even more audacious deadlines, paced the backstage corridor.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light filtering through a fractured skylight, illuminating the skeletal remains of a set, a shattered vision of a forgotten play.  The year was 1928.  The Grand Theatre of Ashworth, once a beacon of polished grandeur, was now a crumbling monument to forgotten dreams, a testament to the relentless march of time and the often-unforgiving nature of the art world.  This wasn't just any play she was staging; this was *The Crimson Quill*, a monumental, three-act tragedy, commissioned by the enigmatic and notoriously demanding Lord Ashworth himself, and her only hope to salvage the theatre from its inevitable demise.
