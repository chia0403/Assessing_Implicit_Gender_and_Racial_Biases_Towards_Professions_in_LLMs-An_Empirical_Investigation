The biting November wind whipped Amelia Blackwood’s scarf around her face, stinging her cheeks.  The air, thick with the scent of pine needles and damp earth, hung heavy over the Whispering Woods Sanctuary.  Moonlight, fractured by the skeletal branches of ancient oaks, painted long, dancing shadows across the overgrown paths.  Amelia, her name whispered on the wind, clutched her thermos of lukewarm chamomile tea, the faint scent a meager comfort against the chill.  She was the animal caretaker, the silent guardian of the sanctuary's fragile ecosystem, a place teeming with creatures both magnificent and monstrous, both familiar and utterly alien.  Tonight, the sanctuary was eerily quiet, a stark contrast to the usual symphony of chirps, screeches, and the low rumble of contented creatures.  This stillness felt… wrong.


**Setting:** Whispering Woods Sanctuary, a sprawling, enchanted refuge nestled deep within the Appalachian Mountains.  The sanctuary is a patchwork of ancient forests, hidden glades, and rushing streams.  It’s a place where the veil between the natural world and the fantastical is thin, where creatures of myth and legend live alongside more common animals.  Paths wind through overgrown vegetation, illuminated by the ethereal glow of moonlight filtering through the canopy.  The air is thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, punctuated by the occasional earthy aroma of the unique creatures that call the sanctuary home.
