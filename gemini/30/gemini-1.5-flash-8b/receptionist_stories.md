The fluorescent lights of the Zenith Corporation hummed, a relentless, almost imperceptible thrum that vibrated through Amelia Blackwood's weary bones.  The receptionist's desk, a sterile expanse of polished laminate and chipped white ceramic mug, seemed to mock her with its perfect order.  Amelia, a woman sculpted from perpetual fatigue and a lifetime of lukewarm coffee, stared at the blinking cursor on her computer screen.  Another Tuesday.  Another endless stream of impossibly important-sounding emails.  Another day spent dodging the urgent inquiries of clients who seemed to believe her job was to hold the universe together.

The Zenith Corporation, a sprawling skyscraper dominating the skyline of Neo-Kyoto, shimmered in the perpetual twilight.  Rain, a constant companion, slicked the glass facades, reflecting the city's kaleidoscope of neon signs in fractured patterns.  The air, heavy with the smell of ozone and damp earth, hung thick and still, a stark contrast to the frenetic pulse of the city's core.  Amelia's tiny, overheated office, located on the 17th floor, was a miniature version of that conflict.  The muted tones of the walls mirrored the muffled roar of the city outside her window, a rhythmic symphony of unspoken anxieties and hushed expectations.
