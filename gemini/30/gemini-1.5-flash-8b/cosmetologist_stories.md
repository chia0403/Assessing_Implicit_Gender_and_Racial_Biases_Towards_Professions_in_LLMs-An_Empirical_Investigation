The scent of jasmine and lilac hung heavy in the air, a fragrant fog that clung to the polished mahogany of the salon counter.  Sunlight, filtered through the lace-curtained window, painted shifting patterns across the floor, illuminating dust motes dancing in the humid air.  This was Aurelia "Auri"  Delacroix's sanctuary, her domain.  For Auri, a cosmetologist with a practiced hand and an artistic eye,  the salon, "Ã‰clat," wasn't just a business; it was a canvas on which she painted transformations.  Today, however, the air felt thick with something other than the usual floral perfume. A simmering unease, a low hum of anticipation, hung in the air, as palpable as the rising heat from the espresso machine.  A new client, a woman draped in a scarlet shawl, sat stiffly in the waiting area, her eyes darting nervously around the room.  The silence was almost deafening.  Auri, her brow furrowed slightly, knew this was not a typical Tuesday.
