The biting wind whipped Amelia "Em" Harding's lab coat around her legs, stinging her cheeks.  The frosted glass of the clinic's front door reflected the harsh, fluorescent glow of the interior.  She shivered, not just from the cold, but from the growing unease in her stomach.  This wasn't your typical Wednesday morning at the Mountain View Family Clinic.  The usually bustling waiting room was eerily quiet, the rhythmic hum of the machines almost absent.  A single, flickering fluorescent light cast long, ominous shadows across the sterile white walls.

Em, Physician's Assistant, was supposed to be documenting patient histories, not bracing herself for the potential horror of what waited inside.  Dr. Chen, her supervising physician, was notoriously meticulous, but thisâ€¦ this was different.  This was unsettling.  And the persistent, metallic tang in the air, a scent unfamiliar and disturbingly sharp, only amplified the dread.  The mountain air, usually crisp and invigorating, felt suffocating.  Mountain View, nestled in the shadow of the jagged peaks, normally exuded a quiet, comforting beauty.  Today, it felt suffocating, as if the breath of the mountain itself had turned sour.
