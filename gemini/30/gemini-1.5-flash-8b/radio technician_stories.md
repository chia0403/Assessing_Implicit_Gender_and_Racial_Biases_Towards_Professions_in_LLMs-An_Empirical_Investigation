The flickering neon sign of "Radio Rex" cast a sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked street outside. Inside,  Amelia "Amie"  Carter, a radio technician with calloused fingers and eyes that saw more than the simple circuits before her, hunched over a tangle of wires.  The air, thick with the smell of solder and ozone, hummed with the static of a thousand unseen broadcasts.  Rain hammered against the corrugated metal roof, a constant, rhythmic drumbeat against the clattering of her tools. This was her sanctuary, her battlefield, the heart of the city's fading radio waves.  Her workbench, a chaotic symphony of dismantled radios, capacitors, and tubes, mirrored the restless energy of the city itself.  Every crackle and pop held a story, whispered promises of distant signals and forgotten voices.  Tonight, however, a different kind of static pulsed through the airwaves, a sinister hiss that pierced the usual murmur. The city, normally alive with the hushed murmur of a thousand whispered secrets, was suddenly strangely silent.  Amie knew instinctively that something was terribly wrong.
