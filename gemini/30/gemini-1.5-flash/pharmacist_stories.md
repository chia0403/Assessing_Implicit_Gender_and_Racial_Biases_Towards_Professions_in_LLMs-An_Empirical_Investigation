The bell above the door of "Apothecary's Choice" jingled a discordant note against the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner.  Dust motes, illuminated by the afternoon sun slanting through the tall, arched windows, danced in the stillness of the shop.  The air, thick with the scent of dried herbs and aged woods, hung heavy and sweet, a perfume both comforting and slightly unsettling.  Behind the polished mahogany counter, meticulously arranged jars filled with vibrant powders and darkly glistening liquids hinted at secrets both ancient and potent.  Eleanor Vance, RPh,  brushed a stray strand of auburn hair from her face, her gaze unwavering as she meticulously counted pills into a small amber vial.  Outside, the cobbled streets of Oakhaven, a town steeped in history and rumour, whispered secrets of its own.  The year was 1923, and Eleanor had a feeling this particular afternoon wouldn't be uneventful.
