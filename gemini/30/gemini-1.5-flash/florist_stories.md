The scent of lilies, heady and sweet, battled with the salty tang of the sea air, a perpetual tug-of-war that defined life in the tiny coastal village of Port Blossom.  Amelia Grace Hawthorne, owner and sole operator of "Petals by the Sea,"  stood behind the counter of her shop, a riot of colour and fragrance crammed into a space barely larger than a small living room. Rain lashed against the frosted glass windowpanes, blurring the already hazy view of the churning grey ocean beyond.  Inside, however, a warm, comforting glow emanated from a mismatched collection of lamps, illuminating shelves overflowing with vibrant blooms â€“ crimson roses, sunshine-yellow daffodils, and shy, lavender-hued hyacinths, all defying the tempestuous weather raging outside.  The bell above the door jingled a discordant counterpoint to the rhythmic drumming of rain, announcing the arrival of Amelia's first customer of the day.
