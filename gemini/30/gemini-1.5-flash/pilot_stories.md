The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful song around Captain Evelyn "Evie" Reedâ€™s battered Cessna 185, the icy breath of the Chugach Mountains a tangible presence against the fuselage.  Below, the vast expanse of the Kenai Fjords National Park spread like a crumpled, snow-dusted map, a labyrinth of jagged peaks, frozen waterfalls, and glacier-carved valleys swallowed by twilight.  The setting sun, a bruised purple and blood orange smear on the horizon, cast long, skeletal shadows across the unforgiving landscape, highlighting the precariousness of Evie's current mission: a late-season supply run to a remote research station perched precariously on the edge of a glacier, a place where the only sound louder than the wind was the relentless crackle and groan of shifting ice.
