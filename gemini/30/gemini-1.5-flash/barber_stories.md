The scent of Bay Rum and Old Spice hung thick and sweet in the air, a cloying perfume clinging to the worn leather of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's barber chair.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single, bare bulb swinging precariously above, danced in the afternoon sun that slanted through the grimy window of his shop, "Butterfield's Barbers," on the edge of Grimsborough's less-than-savory Dockside district.  Salt spray, a constant reminder of the churning grey sea just beyond the cobblestones, mingled with the aroma of fish guts and something vaguely acrid that Barty suspected originated in the nearby distillery.  The shop itself was a testament to time and neglect: chipped porcelain sinks, a cracked mirror reflecting a fractured image of the world, and tools – scissors, razors, combs – that had seen better days, yet remained stubbornly reliable in Barty's capable hands.
