The brass spittoon gleamed under the dim, guttering gaslight, reflecting the weary slump of Archibald "Archie" Fitzwilliam's shoulders.  Rain lashed against the stained-glass windows of the Grand Majestic Hotel, a furious percussion accompanying the mournful wail of the foghorn out on the fog-choked harbour.  The air hung thick with the scent of damp wool, stale cigars, and the faintly metallic tang of seawater.  Archie, a bellhop whose uniform, once a crisp navy blue, now bore the marks of countless spilled drinks and hurried trips, stared blankly at the swirling vortex of water collecting in the ornate brass ashtray beside him.  The opulent lobby, usually a cacophony of arriving guests and chattering society dames, was eerily deserted, save for the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner, each chime a heavy hammer blow against the oppressive silence. Tonight, the Grand Majestic felt less like a grand hotel and more like a gilded cage awaiting some unseen, and undoubtedly unpleasant, visitor.
