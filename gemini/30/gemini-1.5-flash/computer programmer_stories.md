The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Anya Sharma's tiny apartment, a relentless rhythm that mirrored the frantic beat of her own heart.  Each drop was a tiny percussion instrument in the symphony of her impending deadline.  Anya, a coding prodigy whose apartment was more accurately described as a meticulously organized chaos of empty energy drink cans and half-eaten ramen containers, stared at the flickering cursor on her dual-monitor setup.  The screen glowed with lines of Python code, a digital battlefield where she was locked in a desperate struggle against a particularly stubborn bug. Outside, the neon lights of Bangalore blurred into streaks of colour through the rain-lashed window, a stark contrast to the sterile white of her coding environment.  The air hung thick with the scent of damp earth and frying pakoras from the street vendor downstairs â€“ a scent she barely registered amidst the pressure cooker of her current project.  Tonight, Anya Sharma would either conquer the Kraken of a software glitch or be conquered by it.
