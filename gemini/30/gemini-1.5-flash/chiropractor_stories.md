The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's auburn hair across her face as she wrestled the stubborn key into the lock of her chiropractic clinic.  Rain, the kind that lashed down in sheets and threatened to peel the paint from the weathered clapboard of her building, hammered against the windows.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of ozone from the recent lightning storm and the faint, comforting aroma of essential oils â€“ lavender and chamomile, carefully chosen to soothe the frayed nerves of her patients.  Amy's clinic, "Hawthorne Holistic Healing," nestled on the edge of sleepy Oakhaven, a town so quaint it felt like a postcard come to life.  The old Victorian building, with its gingerbread trim and creaking floorboards, was as much a part of her practice as the adjusting table in the back room.  Tonight, however, the usual comforting solitude felt heavy, even oppressive.  A sense of unease, as sharp and sudden as the crack of thunder that had shaken the town just hours before, settled in her stomach.
