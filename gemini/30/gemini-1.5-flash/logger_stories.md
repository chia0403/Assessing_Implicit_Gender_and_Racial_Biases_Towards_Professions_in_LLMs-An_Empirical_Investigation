The biting wind, a razor-edged thing honed on the frozen peaks of the Cascade Mountains, whipped at Silas Blackwood’s beard, turning the already stiff bristles into icy daggers.  Silas, his face weathered like ancient bark and his eyes the deep, knowing blue of a twilight sky, gripped the worn handle of his axe with calloused hands.  The air hung heavy with the scent of pine and damp earth, a familiar perfume that had clung to him since he was a boy, tracing the scent of his father before him, generation after generation of Blackwoods claiming this unforgiving, beautiful land as their own.  He stood at the edge of the Whispering Pines, a stand of ancient giants so colossal, so old, they seemed to hum with a silent, ageless power – a power that both awed and unsettled him.  The dawn, a bruised purple bleeding into hesitant gold, cast long, skeletal shadows from the towering trees, making the forest seem less a place of life, and more a cathedral to the slow, deliberate march of time.  Today, Silas Blackwood would claim a piece of that time, a piece of that power, with each swing of his axe.
