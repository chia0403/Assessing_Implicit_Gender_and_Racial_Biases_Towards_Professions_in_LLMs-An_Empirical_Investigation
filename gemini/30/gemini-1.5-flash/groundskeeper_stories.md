The biting November wind whipped Elias Thorne’s already-chapped lips raw as he wrestled with a stubborn oak branch, its leaves clinging desperately to life despite the encroaching frost.  Elias, a man whose hands were as rough as bark and whose face bore the map of a thousand sunrises and sunsets spent tending the sprawling grounds of Blackwood Manor, grunted with exertion. Blackwood Manor itself loomed behind him, a gothic behemoth of grey stone, its many windows like vacant eyes staring out across the bleak, windswept Yorkshire moors. The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, a perfume Elias found strangely comforting after decades spent in its embrace.  The only sound, besides the mournful cry of a distant curlew, was the rhythmic scrape of his pruning shears against the brittle wood.  This was his sanctuary, his kingdom – a kingdom of sprawling lawns, ancient trees, and secrets buried beneath the soil.
