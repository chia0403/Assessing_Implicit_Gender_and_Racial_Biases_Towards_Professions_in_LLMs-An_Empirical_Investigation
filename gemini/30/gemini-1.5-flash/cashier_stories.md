The fluorescent lights of "Quick Stop & Shop" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Grace Hawthorne's Tuesday night.  The air hung thick with the cloying sweetness of stale donuts and the faint, metallic tang of spilled soda â€“ a familiar perfume in the life of a convenience store cashier.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the already indistinct neon signs of the surrounding businesses into shimmering, watercolor streaks.  Inside, Amelia, her name tag slightly askew, meticulously scanned a bag of suspiciously lumpy tortilla chips, her gaze betraying none of the boredom that gnawed at her insides.  The only other occupants of the store were a lone, hunched figure browsing the lottery tickets and a sputtering, temperamental coffee machine that wheezed and gurgled intermittently in the corner.  This was Amelia's world, at least for the next five hours.
