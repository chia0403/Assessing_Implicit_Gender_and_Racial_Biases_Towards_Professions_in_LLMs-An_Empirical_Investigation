Tonight, the usual hum of discreet requests – theatre tickets, private dinners, last-minute travel arrangements – had been replaced by an almost palpable tension.  The air, usually scented with expensive perfume and freshly brewed coffee, carried a sharper, metallic tang, the kind that clung to secrets and whispered of impending trouble.
