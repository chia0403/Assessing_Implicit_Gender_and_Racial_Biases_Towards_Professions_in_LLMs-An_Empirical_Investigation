The pre-dawn chill nipped at Elias Thorne’s cheeks as he wrestled the heavy oak door of Thorne’s Treats open.  A faint, rosy blush was beginning to paint the eastern sky, mirroring the blush of warmth already blooming in the bakery’s brick oven. The air, thick with the yeasty scent of rising sourdough and the sweet perfume of caramelizing sugar, hung heavy and comforting in the still-dark shop. Dust motes, illuminated by the single bare bulb hanging above the counter, danced in the quiet before the day’s bustle began.  Outside, the cobblestone streets of the ancient port town of Oakhaven were deserted, their slumber only broken by the distant cries of gulls.  Elias, his flour-dusted apron already tied, hummed a low, wordless tune, the rhythm a counterpoint to the gentle crackle of the fire within the oven – a familiar symphony that had been the soundtrack to his life for as long as he could remember.
