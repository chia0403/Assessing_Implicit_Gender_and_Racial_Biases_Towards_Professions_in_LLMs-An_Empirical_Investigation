The salt-laced wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne's auburn hair across her face as she wrestled the For Sale sign into the frozen earth.  January in Seabrook, Maine, was a beast, a snarling, icy beast that gnawed at exposed skin and threatened to swallow the quaint, seaside town whole.  The sky, a bruised purple, mirrored the mood of the market: sluggish, uncertain, and frankly, terrifying for someone whose livelihood depended on selling overpriced waterfront cottages to wealthy out-of-staters.  The house itself, a rambling Victorian with peeling paint and a distinctly haunted air, didn't exactly inspire confidence either. Amelia shivered, pulling her thick wool scarf tighter around her neck.  This was her last showing before heading home to a much-needed mug of hot chocolate and the comforting glow of the fireplace.  Selling this relic would be her New Year's miracle.
