The brine-soaked sawdust crunched under Bartholomew "Barty" Butchersby's heavy boots, a familiar symphony in the pre-dawn chill of his shop.  Barty's Butchery, a squat, stone building clinging to the cobbled edge of Oakhaven's market square, smelled less of blood and more of woodsmoke and rosemary â€“ a testament to Barty's meticulous cleaning and his fondness for subtly perfuming his wares.  The air hung thick with the promise of a busy market day, a promise amplified by the low hum of the sharpening steel from his workshop beyond the main sales area.  Outside, the first streaks of dawn painted the sky a bruised purple, promising a day as crisp and clean as the freshly-cut lamb chops awaiting Barty's expert hand.  He adjusted his apron, the worn leather creaking a counterpoint to the rhythmic *thwack-thwack-thwack* of his cleaver, already testing its edge against the steel.
