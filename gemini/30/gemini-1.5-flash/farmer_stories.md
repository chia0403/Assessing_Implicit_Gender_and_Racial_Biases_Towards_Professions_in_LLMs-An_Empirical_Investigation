The wind, a rasping, icy hand, clawed at Elias Thorne's weathered face as he surveyed his fields.  January’s grip held tight on the valley of Oakhaven, a blanket of snow concealing the frozen earth beneath.  The skeletal branches of the ancient oak trees that lined the perimeter of Thorne’s farm – a rambling collection of barns, sheds, and a farmhouse clinging stubbornly to the hillside – were etched starkly against the bruised purple of the twilight sky.  The air hung heavy with the scent of pine and the faint, metallic tang of frozen soil. Elias, his breath misting before him, pulled his thick wool scarf tighter around his neck, the worn leather of his gloves creaking with each movement.  His gaze, a pale blue sharpened by years of harsh winters and relentless toil, rested on a particularly stubborn patch of snowdrift blocking the path to his prize-winning Clydesdale’s stable.  This wasn't just any snow; this was the kind that promised a long, hard winter, and Elias Thorne knew, with a chilling certainty, that it would test him to his very limits.
