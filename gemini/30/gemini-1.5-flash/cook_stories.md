The salt spray stung Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's face as she hauled the last crate of oysters onto the deck of the *Sea Serpent*.  The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum sinking below the churning grey Atlantic, cast long shadows across the rolling waves. The air, thick with the briny tang of the ocean and the sharp, sweet scent of seaweed, clung to everything – her oilskins, her hair, even the rough-hewn wood of the fishing boat. Amy, her hands chapped and raw, wiped a smear of seawater from her cheek, leaving a glistening trail against the grime.  The *Sea Serpent*, a sturdy but aging vessel, bobbed precariously as it fought against the restless sea, a fitting backdrop to the tempest brewing inside her own belly.  Tonight, Amy Hawthorne, head chef of the floating restaurant *The Leviathan*, would face her greatest culinary challenge yet – a surprise inspection from the notoriously harsh food critic, Mr. Silas Blackwood.
