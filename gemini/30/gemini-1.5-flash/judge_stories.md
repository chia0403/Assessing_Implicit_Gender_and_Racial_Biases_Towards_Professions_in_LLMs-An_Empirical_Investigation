The air hung thick and humid, a damp blanket clinging to the skin of Judge Evelyn Beatrice Ainsworth as she navigated the labyrinthine corridors of the Old Bailey.  The scent of aged oak and something faintly metallic – perhaps decades of spilled coffee and suppressed anxieties – clung to the stone walls.  Gaslight flickered, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to mock the solemnity of her surroundings. Rain lashed against the tall, gothic windows, a relentless percussion accompanying the muted whispers and hurried footsteps echoing from the chambers beyond.  Evelyn adjusted the heavy, black silk of her judicial robes, a small sigh escaping her lips.  Another night, another case, another weight pressing down on her already burdened shoulders.  Tonight, however, felt different.  The weight felt heavier, the shadows darker, the whispers… more insistent.
