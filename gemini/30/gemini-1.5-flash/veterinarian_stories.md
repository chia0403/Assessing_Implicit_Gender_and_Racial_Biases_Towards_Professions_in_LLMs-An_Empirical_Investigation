The biting November wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vance's auburn hair across her face as she wrestled the reluctant Shetland pony, aptly named Tempest, into the examination trailer.  The air hung thick with the smells of damp earth, pine needles, and something vaguely equine – a potent blend that was, to Eleanor, far more comforting than any perfume.  She was parked precariously on the edge of Blackwood Forest, a sprawling wilderness known as much for its ancient, gnarled oaks as for its eccentric inhabitants and the occasional mysteriously injured woodland creature.  The trailer itself, a repurposed horsebox painted a faded teal, rattled slightly with each gust of wind, a testament to its age and the rugged terrain.  Inside, the single bare bulb cast long, dancing shadows on the worn linoleum floor, highlighting the array of veterinary tools neatly arranged on a stainless steel counter – a stark contrast to the wildness just beyond the flimsy canvas doors.
