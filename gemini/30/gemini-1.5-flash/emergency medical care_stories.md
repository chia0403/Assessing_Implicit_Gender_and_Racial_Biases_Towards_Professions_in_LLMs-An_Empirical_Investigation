Headlights sliced through the downpour, reflecting off the chrome of a mangled sedan crumpled against a concrete barrier.  Sirens wailed in the distance, a mournful chorus echoing the chaos unfolding before Elias. He crouched beside the wrecked vehicle, the beam of his flashlight cutting a swathe through the deluge, illuminating the twisted metal and shattered safety glass.  The air, thick with the scent of gasoline and fear, vibrated with the low, rhythmic pulse of the injured man trapped inside.  Eliasâ€™s gloved hands, already cold despite the exertion, moved with practiced efficiency, assessing the scene, his mind already calculating the best course of action.  The city, a concrete beast slumbering under a violent storm, held its breath, awaiting the outcome.
