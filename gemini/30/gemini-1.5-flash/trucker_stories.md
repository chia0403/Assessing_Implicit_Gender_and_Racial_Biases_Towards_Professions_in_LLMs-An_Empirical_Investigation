The biting Montana wind howled a mournful dirge around Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins' rig, a sound that echoed the emptiness gnawing at his gut.  His eighteen-wheeler, a battered but beloved Kenworth named "Betsy," groaned under the weight of a near-empty trailer, the only cargo a lingering scent of pine needles from a recent lumber haul.  The vast, snow-dusted plains stretched before him, a desolate canvas painted in shades of grey and white under a bruised, twilight sky.  The only other visible life forms were the skeletal branches of wind-twisted junipers clawing at the horizon, their silhouettes stark against the fading light. Bart gripped the steering wheel, his knuckles white against the worn leather, the icy air seeping into the cab despite the heater's valiant struggle.  He was miles from anywhere, hours from the nearest town, and light-years from peace of mind.  This stretch of I-90, between Billings and Bozeman, always felt like the edge of the world, a feeling Bart knew all too well these days.
