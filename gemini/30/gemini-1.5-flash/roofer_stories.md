The wind, a snarling beast with teeth of grit and ice, clawed at Elias Thorne’s worn work gloves.  Below him, the city of Oakhaven sprawled, a tapestry of red-tiled roofs and frosted windowpanes shimmering under the bruised purple of a January twilight.  Elias, perched precariously on the gabled peak of Mrs. Gable’s Victorian monstrosity, felt the familiar thrill of the height, a counterpoint to the bone-deep chill that seeped into his very marrow.  The air thinned with each gust, carrying the faint scent of woodsmoke and something else… something metallic, sharp, like the tang of blood.  He shifted his weight, the old shingles crunching under his boots, and tightened his grip on the hammer.  Tonight, the job was more than just patching a leak;  tonight, it felt like battling the elements themselves.
