The fluorescent lights of the Meadowbrook Medical Center hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the low thrum of anxious whispers echoing down the sterile hallway.  Isabelle “Izzy” Moreau, a phlebotomist with a perpetually weary smile and eyes that had seen too much morning sickness and too little sleep, adjusted the already-tight knot of her lab coat.  The scent of antiseptic and something faintly floral, probably from the overflowing vase of lilies near the reception desk, hung heavy in the air, a constant reminder of the fragile lives she navigated each day.  It was 6:17 AM, the quiet before the storm of poking, prodding, and the inevitable, unpredictable torrent of human emotion that accompanied a simple blood draw.  Today, however, felt different.  The usual pre-dawn calm was absent, replaced by a tangible tension that prickled at the back of Izzy's neck, a feeling that something was…off.
