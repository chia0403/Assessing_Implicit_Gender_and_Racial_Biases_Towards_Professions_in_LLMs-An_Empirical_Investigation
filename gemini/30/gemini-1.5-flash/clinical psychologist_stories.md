The flickering neon sign of the "Nightingale Cafe" cast a sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked streets of Seattle.  Dr. Eleanor Vance, her sensible beige coat plastered to her damp frame, pulled her scarf tighter around her neck, the damp chill seeping into her bones despite the wool.  The aroma of damp earth and roasting coffee beans battled for dominance in the air, a scent as familiar to her as the worn leather of her favorite armchair in her office.  Inside, the cafe buzzed with a low hum of conversation, a muted symphony of clinking mugs and the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of keyboards.  Eleanor, however, felt anything but calm.  Tonight, the usual comforting predictability of her routine felt brittle, like a thin layer of ice threatening to crack under the weight of the coming storm.  This wasn't a typical late-night coffee run; this was a meeting, and the patient she was about to see was unlike any sheâ€™d encountered before.
