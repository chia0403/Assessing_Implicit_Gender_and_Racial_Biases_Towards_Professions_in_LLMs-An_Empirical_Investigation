The fluorescent lights of the "Discount Dan's Deals" showroom hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Grace Hawthorne's carefully constructed smile.  Amelia, a name usually associated with genteel tea parties and not cutthroat appliance sales, wrestled with a particularly stubborn display of waffle irons.  Their chrome surfaces gleamed under the harsh lights, reflecting the weary look in her own eyes.  The air, thick with the scent of ozone and slightly burnt plastic (a lingering testament to a disastrous demonstration earlier that day), hung heavy and still.  Discount Dan's, nestled precariously between a pawn shop and a tire repair center on the wrong side of town, wasn't exactly the epitome of retail elegance, but it was Amelia's battlefield, and today, she was losing the war.
