The salt spray stung Elara Vance's face, a familiar kiss from the unforgiving Atlantic.  She perched on the crumbling edge of the old stone jetty, the wind whipping her unruly auburn hair across her canvas.  The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum sinking towards the horizon, cast long shadows across the churning grey sea, painting the water in shades of indigo and gunmetal.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and seaweed, vibrated with the lonely cry of gulls.  This was her sanctuary, this windswept corner of Penzance, Cornwall â€“ a place where the raw, untamed beauty of the coast mirrored the tempestuous spirit within Elara herself.  Her easel, battered and scarred from countless storms, stood steadfast beside her, a silent witness to years spent capturing the ephemeral moods of the ocean.
