The air in "The Gilded Lily" hung thick with the scent of expensive perfume and desperation.  It clung to the plush velvet curtains, the antique barstools, and even to the crisp white shirt of Amelia Katherine Finch, as she navigated the crowded dining room with a tray laden precariously with three glasses of champagne and a plate of oysters so meticulously arranged they looked like tiny, glistening jewels.  The low hum of conversation, punctuated by the clinking of silverware and the occasional burst of laughter, was a familiar symphony to Amelia, a soundtrack to her nightly ballet of balancing trays, memorizing orders, and placating demanding patrons.  Tonight, however, the usual background noise felt amplified, each sound a sharp, discordant note against the thrumming anxiety in her own chest.  The Lily, usually a haven of glittering opulence, felt tonight like a gilded cage.
