The chipped ceramic mug warmed Amelia Hernandezâ€™s hands, a paltry defense against the November chill that seeped through the drafty window of her travel agency, "Wanderlust & Co." Rain lashed against the panes, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  Amelia, a woman whose spirit usually blazed as brightly as the turquoise seas she so often sold to her clients, felt a dull ache behind her eyes and a leaden weight in her stomach.  The scent of old paper and slightly stale coffee hung in the air, a familiar aroma that tonight felt less comforting and more like a shroud.  Outside, the neon glow of the "Grand Budapest Hotel" (a distinctly less grand motel, in reality) cast a sickly yellow light on the rain-slicked streets of  Little Havana, Miami.  The vibrant pulse of the city, usually a source of inspiration, felt muted, distant, as Amelia stared out at the storm, her future as uncertain as the capricious Florida weather.
