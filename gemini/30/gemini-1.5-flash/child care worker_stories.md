The chipped paint of the "Sunshine Smiles" daycare center's front door flaked onto Elara Genevieve Thorne's sensible brown shoes as she wrestled it open with a hip-bump.  Rain, the kind that clung to everything like a persistent toddler, plastered her unruly auburn curls to her forehead.  The air inside, however, was a comforting contrast â€“ a chaotic symphony of giggling, crayon scribbles, and the faint, sugary scent of spilled juice boxes.  Elara, twenty-two with eyes that held the weary wisdom of someone twice her age, smiled despite the damp chill that clung to her.  Sunshine Smiles might be falling apart at the seams, both literally and metaphorically, but it was *her* falling apart at the seams, and she wouldn't have it any other way.
