Rain lashed against the grimy windows of The Sentinel’s office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Amelia “Amy” Reyes.  Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the cluttered desks and overflowing ashtrays. Cigarette smoke, cheap coffee, and the faint scent of mildew hung heavy in the air.  Sentinel, Pennsylvania, a town clinging precariously to the rust belt’s decaying edge, was a place people left, not flocked to.  Amy, however, was tethered to it, both by the weight of family obligation and the gnawing suspicion that beneath the town’s veneer of quiet desperation, a story was waiting to be unearthed.  Tonight, as the clock ticked past midnight and the rest of the skeletal staff had long since gone home, that story felt closer than ever.  A crumpled police blotter lay on her desk, a single, chilling sentence circled in red ink: “John Doe found deceased, Blackwood Forest.  Cause of death undetermined.” Blackwood Forest was Sentinel’s dark heart, a place whispered about in hushed tones, a place where secrets took root and flourished in the shadows.
