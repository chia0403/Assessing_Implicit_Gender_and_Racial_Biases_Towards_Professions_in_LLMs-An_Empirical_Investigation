The Nevada sun, a malevolent eye in the vast, bleached sky, beat down on the cab of the eighteen-wheeler.  Dust devils danced across the cracked asphalt of Highway 50, the so-called "Loneliest Road in America," and shimmered like heat-haze ghosts.  Inside, the air conditioning struggled against the oppressive heat, a low hum accompanying the rumble of the engine.  Delilah “Dee” Johnson, her brow furrowed in concentration, gripped the steering wheel of her rig, “The Wanderer,” a name hand-painted in swirling turquoise script across its crimson hood.  A worn map lay unfolded on the passenger seat, marking the long haul from Ely to Fallon, a stretch of desert that swallowed sound and seemed to stretch on into eternity.  A half-eaten sandwich sat beside the map, a testament to Dee’s hasty lunch break, taken at a dusty gas station hours ago, a place forgotten as soon as it disappeared in her rearview mirror.  This was Dee’s life: the open road, the endless horizon, and the constant, low thrum of solitude.
