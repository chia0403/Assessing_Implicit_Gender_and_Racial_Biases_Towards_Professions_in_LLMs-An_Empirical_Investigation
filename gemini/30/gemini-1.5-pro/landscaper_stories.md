The biting wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's auburn braid across her face as she surveyed the overgrown expanse of the Hemlock House gardens.  Twisted rhododendron bushes clawed at the grey stone walls, their once-vibrant blooms long faded, replaced by a sickly, mildew-tinged green.  The fountain in the center of the courtyard, a cherubic figure perpetually poised to pour water from an overflowing urn, stood dry and cracked, choked by creeping ivy. Hemlock House itself loomed over the scene, a gothic monstrosity of dark stone and leaded glass windows that seemed to watch Amy with a disapproving stare.  Located on the windswept cliffs of the Cornish coast, the house had been empty for almost a decade, rumored to be cursed by generations of shipwrecks and unfortunate accidents.  Amy, however, was more concerned with the unruly tangle of nature than any spectral inhabitants. This was her biggest job yet â€“ bringing life back to these neglected gardens, and she wasn't about to be intimidated by a few overgrown shrubs and a spooky reputation.
