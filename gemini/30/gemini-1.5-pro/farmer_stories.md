The biting wind whipped across the frost-kissed fields of Abernathy Farm, stinging Elias Thatcher's cheeks and turning his nose a painful shade of crimson.  November in the Derbyshire Dales had a beauty all its own, a stark and unforgiving kind of loveliness that Elias, after forty-two years of living on this land, had come to appreciate, even amidst the hardship it brought.  The sun, a pale disc barely peeking over the crest of Kinder Scout, cast long, skeletal shadows from the bare branches of the oak trees that lined the lane leading up to the farmhouse.  Smoke curled lazily from the chimney, a promise of warmth and the comforting aroma of Mrs. Thatcher's oatcakes, a scent that usually filled Elias with a deep contentment.  This morning, however, a knot of unease tightened in his stomach, a feeling as cold and hard as the frozen earth beneath his worn leather boots.  Something wasn't right. The usual lowing of the cows in the lower pasture was absent, and an eerie silence hung in the air, broken only by the mournful cry of a distant crow.
