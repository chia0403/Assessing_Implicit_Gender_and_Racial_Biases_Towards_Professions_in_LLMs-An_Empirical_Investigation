The chipped paint on the windowsill of Elias Thorne's office matched the frayed edges of his patience.  Rain lashed against the glass, a relentless drumming that mirrored the throbbing headache building behind his eyes.  Elias, full name Elias Peter Thorne, meticulously adjusted the crooked calendar on his desk. July 17th, 1957.  Another sweltering, stormy summer day in Havenwood, Florida, a town where the humidity clung to you like a second skin and the sweet tea flowed as freely as the gossip.  His office, tucked between a dilapidated beauty parlor and a perpetually empty storefront on Magnolia Street, wasn't much, but it was his.  A small brass plaque on the door proclaimed "Elias P. Thorne - Insurance & Financial Planning," a testament to his unwavering, if slightly desperate, optimism that Havenwood's residents would someday see the value in securing their futures.  Today, however, the only future Elias could envision involved a strong drink and the blessed silence of his empty apartment.
