The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, rattling the windows of Dr. Elspeth “Ellie” MacIntyre’s small veterinary clinic.  Perched on the edge of the remote Scottish village of Portwenn, the clinic, a converted crofter's cottage, was more drafty than Ellie would like, especially on a night like this. The slate-grey sky threatened snow, and the only sound louder than the wind’s howl was the mournful bleating of a Shetland ewe penned in the exam room.  Ellie, her auburn braid coming loose from beneath her woolen cap, sighed, rubbing a smudge of lanolin from her cheek. Lambing season was always hectic, but this year, with the early frost and the persistent gales, it felt particularly brutal.  Portwenn, nestled between the unforgiving sea and the towering, heather-clad slopes of Ben Mor, wasn't an easy place to live, neither for humans nor animals. But it was Ellie’s home, and she wouldn't have it any other way.
