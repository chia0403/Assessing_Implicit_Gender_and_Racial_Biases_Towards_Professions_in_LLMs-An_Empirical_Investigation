The rusted hulk of a '67 Mustang Fastback squatted in the bay, its once-vibrant Candy Apple Red now a patchwork of peeling paint and surface rust. Grease stained the concrete floor of Rosie's Auto Repair, a sprawl of mismatched toolboxes, discarded parts, and the perpetual scent of motor oil and stale coffee.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom of the late October afternoon.  Elara "Ellie" Vasquez, her name stitched in faded cursive on her oil-stained overalls, wiped a bead of sweat from her brow with the back of a greasy hand.  The wrench in her grip slipped, clanging against the Mustang's engine block with a discordant echo that rattled the corrugated iron walls of the small shop nestled just outside the sleepy town of Harmony Creek, Oregon.  A chill wind, carrying the scent of pine and damp earth, whistled through the gaps in the siding, a harbinger of the coming winter. Ellie sighed, the sound swallowed by the rustle of falling leaves just beyond the open bay doors. This wasn't how she'd envisioned spending her Tuesday.
