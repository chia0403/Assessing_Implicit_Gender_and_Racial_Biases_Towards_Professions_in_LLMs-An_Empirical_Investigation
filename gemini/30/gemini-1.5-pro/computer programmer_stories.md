Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Elias Thorne's apartment, blurring the already fading cityscape of Neo-Kyoto into a hazy wash of neon and steel.  Thirty stories below, the perpetually congested skyways hummed with the electric thrum of automated vehicles. Inside, the only sound was the rhythmic click-clack of Elias's mechanical keyboard, a vintage Cherry MX Blue he refused to part with, no matter how much his neighbors complained. His apartment, a minimalist cube dominated by a massive curved monitor and stacks of technical manuals, was a sanctuary of ordered chaos. Empty ramen containers littered the desk, interspersed with crumpled diagrams of intricate code structures.  Elias, hunched in his ergonomic chair, his dark hair falling into his eyes, hadn't slept in thirty-six hours. He was close, he could feel it. Just a few more lines of code, and he would crack the encryption.  The fate of the decentralized network, and perhaps even the city itself, rested on his fingertips.
