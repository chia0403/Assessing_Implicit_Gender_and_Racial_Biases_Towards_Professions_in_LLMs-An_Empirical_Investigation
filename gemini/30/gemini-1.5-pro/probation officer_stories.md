The fluorescent lights of the Albany County Probation Office hummed a monotonous B flat, a soundtrack to Eleanor Vance's Tuesday morning. Rain lashed against the grimy windows, mirroring the grey, oppressive weight that seemed permanently settled over the city. Eleanor, full name Eleanor Rose Vance, tapped a chipped mug of lukewarm coffee against her desk, the sound swallowed by the cacophony of ringing phones and the low murmur of hushed conversations. Files, stacked precariously high on her desk, threatened to topple like a poorly constructed Jenga tower. Each file represented a life teetering on the edge, a fragile hope clinging to the threads of rehabilitation.  The air was thick with the stale scent of instant coffee, cheap air freshener, and something indefinablyâ€¦desperate. Albany, a city clinging to its faded industrial glory, seemed to breed a particular kind of weary resilience, one that Eleanor, after five years on the job, was beginning to understand intimately. This Tuesday, however, promised to be different.  A new file sat atop the precarious stack, its manila surface crisp and unblemished, the name typed in bold black letters: Silas "The Serpent" Blackwood.
