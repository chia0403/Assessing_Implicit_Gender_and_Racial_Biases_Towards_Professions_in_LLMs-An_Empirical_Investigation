The humid Florida air hung heavy, thick with the scent of hibiscus and impending rain.  Inside "Nailed It," a tiny salon squeezed between a laundromat and a pawn shop on Tamiami Trail, the whir of a nail drill fought a losing battle against the strains of salsa spilling from the open doorway next door.  Esmeralda "Esme" Rodriguez sighed, wiping a stray bead of sweat from her brow with the back of her hand. The air conditioning unit, affectionately nicknamed "Frosty" by Esme, had given up the ghost again.  It was only Tuesday, and already the week felt longer than a set of acrylics on a Kardashian.  Her only client, Mrs. Gladiola Periwinkle, a woman whose name perfectly matched her lavender rinse and floral-print muumuu, was holding forth on the injustices of the early bird special at the Golden Corral.  Esme nodded and smiled, her mind wandering to the stack of bills hidden beneath the tattered copy of Vogue on her workstation.  The rain, which had been threatening all morning, finally began to fall, fat drops splattering against the salon's large front window, distorting the neon "Open" sign hanging crookedly in the glass.  Something about the way the light fractured through the drops made Esme think of broken promises.
