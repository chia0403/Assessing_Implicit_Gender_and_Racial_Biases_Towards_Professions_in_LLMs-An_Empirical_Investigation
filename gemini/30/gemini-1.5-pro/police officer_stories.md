The biting November wind whipped across Detective Isabella “Izzy” Diaz’s face, stinging her cheeks and turning her exposed skin a raw pink.  She tugged her worn leather gloves tighter around her hands, the cheap wool lining doing little to fend off the chill.  Above her, the skeletal branches of the elm trees lining Sycamore Street rattled like dry bones, their leaves long since surrendered to autumn’s grasp.  The street itself, usually bustling with the energy of a small college town, was eerily deserted.  A single flickering streetlamp cast long, distorted shadows, transforming the quaint Victorian houses that lined the block into menacing silhouettes.  Isabella stood on the cracked pavement in front of number 27, a stately two-story house with peeling paint and boarded-up windows, a stark contrast to its meticulously maintained neighbors.  A thin ribbon of yellow crime scene tape fluttered in the wind, marking the boundary between the mundane and the macabre. This was the third break-in this month on Sycamore Street, and something told Izzy this one was different.
