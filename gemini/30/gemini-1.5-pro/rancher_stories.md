The wind, a constant companion in this part of Montana, whipped at Amelia Grace Hollowayâ€™s chapped lips, tasting of snow and the coming winter.  The sky above the sprawling Holloway Ranch was a bruised purple, the colour of a fading bruise, hinting at the fast-approaching dusk.  The air, crisp and biting, carried the faint, metallic tang of frost and the comforting lowing of cattle settling in for the night. Amelia, her worn leather gloves clinging tight to the reins of her trusty quarter horse, Buck, surveyed the rolling hills of her land.  The Holloways had worked this land for generations, their history etched into the very soil, as deep and enduring as the roots of the ponderosa pines that dotted the higher slopes.  This evening, however, a sense of unease settled in Amelia's stomach, heavier than the impending snow, a feeling that whispered of a storm brewing beyond the horizon, a storm that threatened more than just the land.
