The fluorescent lights of the Quick Stop hummed a monotonous B flat, a soundtrack to Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez's Tuesday evening.  Rain lashed against the single pane window, blurring the neon glow of the Gas & Grub sign outside. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and hot dogs rotating slowly on the greasy rollers. Amy, perched on her stool behind the chipped Formica counter, watched rivulets of water race each other down the glass, each one a miniature replica of the Niagara River just a few miles away.  The Quick Stop, nestled on a lonely stretch of highway just outside Niagara Falls, New York, rarely saw much excitement. But tonight, even the usual trickle of truckers and weary travelers had been deterred by the storm, leaving Amy alone with her thoughts and the rhythmic beep of the scanner.
