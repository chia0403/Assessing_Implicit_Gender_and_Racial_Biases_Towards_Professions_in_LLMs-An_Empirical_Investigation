The fluorescent lights of Mr. Arthur Finch's classroom hummed a monotonous B-flat, a soundtrack to the pre-dawn quiet.  Outside, the October sky over the small town of Harmony Creek, Oregon, was a bruised purple, hinting at the sunrise struggling to break through the clinging mist.

He had a particular order for everything, a carefully constructed system to keep the chaos of his life – and the rambunctious teenagers he taught – at bay.  This morning, however, a tremor of unease vibrated beneath his usual calm facade. Something was different.  The air felt heavy, charged with an almost palpable sense of anticipation, like the quiet before a storm, a storm far more potent than the one brewing outside.
