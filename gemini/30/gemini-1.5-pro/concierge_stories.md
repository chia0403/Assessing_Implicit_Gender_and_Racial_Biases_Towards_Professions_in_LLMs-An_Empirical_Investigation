Rain lashed against the Art Deco windows of the Grand Majestic Hotel, blurring the already fading twilight into a hazy lavender. Inside, the lobby glowed with the warm light of crystal chandeliers, reflecting off the polished marble floors. A fire crackled merrily in the grand fireplace, casting dancing shadows on the plush velvet furniture. This was Genevieve "Gigi" Dubois' domain.  As Head Concierge of the Grand Majestic, perched behind her gleaming mahogany desk, Gigi was the gatekeeper to a world of luxury, intrigue, and the occasional dash of the absurd. Tonight, however, the only drama seemed to be the tempest raging outside, and the insistent dripping of a leaky gargoyle perched precariously above the revolving doors.  The lobby was deserted except for Mr. Henderson, the elderly resident who insisted on reading his newspaper by the fire every evening, and a lone bellhop polishing the brass luggage cart with a dedication bordering on the fanatical. Gigi sighed, tapping a perfectly manicured nail against her desk. It promised to be a quiet night.  Little did she know, a phone call was about to shatter the tranquility.
