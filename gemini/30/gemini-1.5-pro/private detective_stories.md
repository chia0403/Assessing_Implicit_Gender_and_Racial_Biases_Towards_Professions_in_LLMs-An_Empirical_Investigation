Rain lashed against the grime-streaked window of Jack Hartigan's office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside him.  November in Chicago had a way of clawing at your soul, and this year, it seemed determined to drag his down to the icy depths of Lake Michigan. Cigarette smoke, thick as a shroud, hung in the air, illuminated by the sickly yellow glow of a desk lamp. The only other light source was the flickering neon sign across the street, advertising "Rosie's 24-Hour Diner," its pink glow a lurid slash against the otherwise monochrome cityscape. Jack Hartigan, Private Investigator, sat hunched over his desk, the remnants of a lukewarm cup of coffee growing cold beside a half-empty bottle of rye. His fedora was pushed back on his head, revealing a hairline that was receding faster than the Chicago Cubs' chances of a World Series win.  The office itself, located above a Polish butcher shop on Milwaukee Avenue, wasn't much to look at.  Cracked linoleum, peeling wallpaper, and a pervasive smell of kielbasa contributed to its distinct lack of charm. But it was his, and tonight, like most nights, it was his sanctuary from the cityâ€™s biting wind and even more biting realities.
