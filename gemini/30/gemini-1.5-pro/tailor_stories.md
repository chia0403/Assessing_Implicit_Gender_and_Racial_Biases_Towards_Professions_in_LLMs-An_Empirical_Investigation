The biting November wind howled down Grimshaw Lane, rattling the windowpanes of Elias Thorne's small tailoring shop.  Inside, nestled between a hissing cast-iron stove and a mountain of bolts of tweed and velvet, Elias hunched over his workbench.  The shop, "Thorne & Needle," was a cozy clutter of half-finished garments, spools of thread cascading from overflowing drawers, and the warm, earthy scent of wool and beeswax.  Gaslight flickered, casting long, dancing shadows across the walls adorned with framed fashion sketches and faded photographs of impeccably dressed gentlemen. Located in the heart of Whitechapel, London, 1888, the shop served a diverse clientele, from dockworkers needing sturdy repairs to aspiring gentlemen seeking a touch of elegance.  Tonight, however, the only company Elias had was the rhythmic click of his shears and the unsettling silence of the fog-choked streets outside.
