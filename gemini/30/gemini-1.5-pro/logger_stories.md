His breath plumed out in ghostly bursts, momentarily obscuring the towering pines that clawed at the bruised, indigo sky.  The air, crisp with the scent of pine needles and damp earth, hung heavy in the stillness of the Cascade Mountains, a silence broken only by the distant rush of the Skykomish River.  Jed, his calloused hands already aching with the promise of the day's labor, stood at the edge of Blackwood's Claim, a swathe of ancient forest his family had worked for three generations.  The towering Douglas firs, some thicker than a man was tall, stood sentinel, their shadowed depths hinting at the raw, untamed power of the wilderness that Jed both revered and wrestled with for his livelihood.  This morning, however, the familiar forest felt different, charged with a strange, unsettling energy, a feeling that prickled the back of Jed's neck like the gaze of something unseen.
