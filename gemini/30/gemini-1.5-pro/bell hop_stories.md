The revolving doors of the Grand Majestic Hotel whispered a sigh of cool air as they ushered Elias Finch onto the bustling sidewalk.  Rain, a slick, shimmering curtain, had just begun to fall on New Orleans, turning Bourbon Street into a kaleidoscope of neon reflections. Elias, his pillbox hat slightly askew, adjusted the brass buttons on his crisp crimson uniform, the Grand Majestic's insignia gleaming dully in the burgeoning twilight.  He hadn't even clocked in for his evening shift yet, but the city, a sultry symphony of jazz and the rumble of streetcars, was already playing its overture.  Elias breathed it in, the humid air thick with the scent of chicory coffee and something indefinably magical, something only the Crescent City could conjure.  He knew this night, like every night at the Grand Majestic, would be full of surprises.
