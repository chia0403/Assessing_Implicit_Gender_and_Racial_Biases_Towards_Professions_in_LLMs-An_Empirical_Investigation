The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, rattling the windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's surgery.  Salt spray clung to the glass, blurring the view of the churning grey water and the skeletal remains of the old Whitby pier.  Inside, the air was thick with the scent of antiseptic and coal smoke, a familiar comfort to Elias.  He sat hunched over a worn leather-bound medical textbook, the flickering gaslight painting his face in a warm orange glow. The rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner marked the slow crawl of time in the isolated fishing village of Port Blossom, Yorkshire, 1888.  A knock echoed through the small room, sharp and insistent, pulling Elias from his studies and back to the realities of a life dedicated to mending broken bones and soothing troubled souls in this windswept corner of the world.
