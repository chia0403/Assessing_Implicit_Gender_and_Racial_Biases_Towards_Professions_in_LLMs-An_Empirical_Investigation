The biting Alaskan wind whipped at Amelia "Ace" Reyes's flight suit, stinging her exposed cheeks despite the thick layers of thermal protection.  Glacier-carved peaks, dusted with fresh snow, clawed at the iron-grey sky above Denali National Park.  Ace adjusted the fur-lined hood of her parka, her breath puffing out in white clouds that quickly dispersed. The setting sun painted the vast wilderness in shades of violet and crimson, casting long, skeletal shadows from the stunted spruce trees clinging to the mountainside.  Her De Havilland Beaver, affectionately nicknamed "The Aurora," was prepped and ready on the makeshift airstrip – a flattened stretch of gravel beside the frozen Wonder Lake. Ace’s mission was urgent: deliver vital medical supplies to a remote research outpost nestled deep within the unforgiving Alaskan Range, before the approaching blizzard made the route impassable.  Time, as always in this unforgiving land, was of the essence.
