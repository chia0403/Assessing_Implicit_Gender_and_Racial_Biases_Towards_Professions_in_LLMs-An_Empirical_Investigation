The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne as he locked up Thorne Chiropractic and Wellness Center, the frosted glass of the door rattling faintly in its frame. Snow, the kind that clung to everything and refused to melt, dusted the quaint, brick-lined streets of Harmony Creek, Vermont.  The scent of woodsmoke hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma that usually soothed Elias. Tonight, however, it did little to ease the knot of unease tightening in his stomach. The last patient of the day, Mrs. Abernathy, had complained of a stiffness in her neck unlike anything he'd encountered before.  It wasn't just the usual tension or a pinched nerve; there was a strange rigidity, a subtle tremor that had sent a shiver down Elias's spine. Harmony Creek, nestled deep in the Green Mountains, was a place where people rarely locked their doors, where gossip travelled faster than the local dial-up internet, and where the biggest excitement usually revolved around the annual maple syrup festival.  But tonight, something felt off, and Elias couldnâ€™t shake the feeling that the quiet town was holding its breath, waiting for something to happen.
