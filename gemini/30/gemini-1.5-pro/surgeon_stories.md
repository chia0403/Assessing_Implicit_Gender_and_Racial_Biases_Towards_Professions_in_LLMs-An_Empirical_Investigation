The biting January wind whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne as he hurried across the cobbled courtyard of St. Jude's Hospital, the hem of his long coat snapping like a flag. Flakes of snow, fat and wet, clung to the shoulders of his impeccably tailored suit. Above him, the gothic arches of the hospital loomed, dark and imposing against the bruised twilight sky.  Built in the 17th century, St. Jude's was a labyrinth of echoing corridors and dimly lit wards, its history steeped in both miraculous recoveries and tragic losses. Elias, Chief of Surgery and a man accustomed to the hushed reverence of operating theatres, felt a familiar prickle of unease. The air tonight was thicker than usual, heavy with a premonition he couldn't quite place.  He pushed open the heavy oak doors, the warmth of the hospital lobby a stark contrast to the glacial air outside.  The scent of antiseptic and brewing coffee hung in the air, a comforting blend he usually found grounding. But tonight, it did little to soothe the unsettling feeling gnawing at him. Something was wrong. He could feel it in his bones.
