The flickering neon sign of "Shear Perfection" buzzed intermittently, casting a lavender glow across the rain-slicked streets of Port Blossom, Oregon. Inside, amongst the aroma of hairspray and sandalwood, Elias Thorne swept up clipped ends of auburn hair, the rhythmic swoosh a counterpoint to the rhythmic drumming of rain against the large bay window. It was a Tuesday evening, the slowest night of the week, and Elias found himself alone in the salon, the other stylists having clocked out hours earlier. The only other sound was the mournful saxophone solo emanating from the vintage radio perched on a shelf near the shampoo bowls.  Port Blossom, a town nestled between the Pacific Ocean and the looming shadow of the Coast Range, wasn't exactly a bustling metropolis, and on nights like this, the quiet felt almost oppressive.  Elias glanced at the clock, its hands inching towards nine. Heâ€™d planned to close up early, but the rain had a way of making him linger, lost in the melancholic symphony of the small coastal town.
