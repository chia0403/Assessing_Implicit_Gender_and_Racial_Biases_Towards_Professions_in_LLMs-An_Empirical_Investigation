The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of plumeria and exhaust fumes.  A dilapidated tuk-tuk sputtered to a stop beside Amelia "Amy" Cartwright, scattering a flock of pigeons that had been pecking at discarded mango peels.  Amy smoothed down her wrinkled linen shirt, wishing for the hundredth time she hadn't opted for white.  Bangkok in April was an unforgiving mistress.  Above the cacophony of horns and street vendors hawking their wares, the golden spires of Wat Arun, the Temple of Dawn, shimmered in the early morning sunlight.  Amy, clutching a microphone and a half-empty bottle of water, plastered a welcoming smile on her face as twenty-two wide-eyed tourists spilled out of the tuk-tuk, blinking in the unfamiliar brightness. This was day one of their ten-day 'Taste of Thailand' tour, and Amy, their designated shepherd through the chaotic beauty of the country, had a feeling it was going to be an interesting ride.
