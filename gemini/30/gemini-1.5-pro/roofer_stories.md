The tar hissed and bubbled, a miniature black volcano erupting on the scorching shingles.  Elias Thorne, his boots planted firmly on the steeply pitched roof of the Weatherby mansion, adjusted his thick gloves and pressed the hot mop down, flattening the bubbling tar into a smooth, obsidian seal.  The July sun beat down on him mercilessly, turning the air above the asphalt shingles into shimmering waves of heat.  Below him, the manicured lawns of Oakhaven, Connecticut, stretched out like an emerald carpet, punctuated by the glittering blue of swimming pools and the occasional flash of white as a tennis ball arced across a court.  The world down there, with its iced tea and shaded verandas, seemed a million miles away from Elias's sweltering perch.  He wiped a trickle of sweat from his forehead with the back of his hand, leaving a streak of black tar across his tanned skin.  A storm was brewing on the horizon, a bruise-colored mass creeping over the distant hills, promising a temporary reprieve from the oppressive heat, but also the threat of a dangerous descent.
