The bell above the door of "Petal & Stem" jingled merrily, a counterpoint to the melancholic November drizzle outside.  Inside, nestled amongst buckets overflowing with hydrangeas the colour of a bruised sky and fragrant lilies still tightly furled, Amelia Grace Hawthorne hummed along to a Billie Holiday record.  Her shop, tucked away on a cobbled side street in the heart of Hay-on-Wye, a town more famous for its books than blossoms, was a riot of colour and scent, a stark contrast to the greyness that clung to the Welsh hills beyond the windowpanes.  Amelia, with her hands stained green from stripping thorns and her auburn hair pulled back in a loose braid, adjusted a drooping sunflower, her brow furrowed in concentration.  This wasn't just a shop; it was her sanctuary, a haven built from a lifelong love of all things that bloomed.  And today, she sensed, something was about to bloom beyond the petals and leaves.
