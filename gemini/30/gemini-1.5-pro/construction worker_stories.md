The pre-dawn chill gnawed at Elijah "Eli" Blackwood's exposed skin as he wrestled with the tarp covering the cement mixer.  A sliver of icy wind, straight off Lake Michigan, sliced through the gaps in his worn Carhartt jacket. Chicago in November was a beast, and 5:00 am on a Monday morning felt especially brutal.  He squinted up at the skeletal steel frame of the future Zenith Tower, a behemoth that was slowly but surely clawing its way into the city skyline.  Fifty-two stories of glass and steel, each one a testament to human ambition and Eli's aching back. The site, a sprawling rectangle of mud, cranes, and precariously stacked I-beams, hummed with the quiet anticipation of another day's work.  A single, bare bulb hanging from a temporary power line cast long, distorted shadows that danced with the dust motes stirred by the rising wind. The air tasted of iron and concrete, a familiar cocktail Eli had come to associate with purpose, and a paycheck.
