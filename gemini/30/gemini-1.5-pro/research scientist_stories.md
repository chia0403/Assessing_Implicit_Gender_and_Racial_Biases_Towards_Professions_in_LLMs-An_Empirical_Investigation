The biting Antarctic wind whipped Dr. Aris Thorne's auburn braid across his face as he wrestled a recalcitrant weather balloon into submission.  The sky, a bruised purple deepening to twilight, bled into the endless white expanse of the Ross Ice Shelf.  Around him, the McMurdo Station research outpost hummed with a quiet energy, a beacon of human endeavor clinging to the edge of the world.  Inside the prefabricated meteorological hut, blinking monitors displayed the approaching storm, its swirling vortex a malevolent eye staring down from the satellite imagery. Aris, bundled in layers that made him resemble a brightly-colored Michelin Man, muttered a frustrated curse as the balloon slipped from his gloved grasp for the third time.  This storm, brewing for the past 72 hours, was unlike any he’d encountered in his five years stationed at the bottom of the Earth.  The barometric pressure was plummeting at an alarming rate, and the accompanying electromagnetic fluctuations were baffling, defying any logical explanation.  This wasn’t just another Antarctic blizzard; it was something… *else*.
