The biting November wind whipped around Eleanor Vance, tugging at the edges of her tweed coat as she wrestled the heavy oak door of the Whisperwood Public Library closed.  Snow dusted the peaked roof of the Victorian-era building, clinging to the intricate carvings of owls and open books that adorned the gables.  Inside, the air was thick with the comforting scent of old paper and beeswax polish, a stark contrast to the icy blast Eleanor had just escaped.  Whisperwood itself, a small, isolated town nestled deep within the Redwood National Park, was shrouded in an almost perpetual twilight beneath the dense canopy of ancient trees.  Here, where cell service was patchy at best and the nearest town a winding hour's drive away, the library served as not just a repository of knowledge, but a vital hub of the community â€“ a role Eleanor took very seriously.
