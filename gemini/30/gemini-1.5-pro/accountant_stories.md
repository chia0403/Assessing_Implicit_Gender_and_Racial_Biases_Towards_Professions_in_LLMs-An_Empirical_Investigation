The frosted glass door of Amelia Hayes’ office, etched with “A. Hayes, Certified Public Accountant,” rattled precariously in its frame every time a lorry rumbled down Cobble Street.  The November wind, sharp enough to shave the whiskers off a polar bear, whistled through the gaps in the windowpane, causing the yellowing invoices stacked on her desk to flutter like nervous birds. Greystone, a town clinging precariously to the rugged coastline of Maine, wasn’t known for its mild autumns.  The tourists had long since departed, leaving behind a skeletal high street and the lingering scent of saltwater taffy.  Amelia, bundled in a thick cardigan despite the electric heater humming valiantly in the corner, stared out at the churning grey sea.  Tax season was looming, a dark cloud on an already bleak horizon, and this year, it felt heavier than usual.  Something wasn't right in Greystone's books, and it wasn't just the predictable dip in revenue from the closed-up clam shacks.  Something deeper, something… fishy.
