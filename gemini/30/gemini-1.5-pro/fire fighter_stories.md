The biting November wind whipped at Amelia "Mia" Rodriguez's turnout coat as she perched on the edge of Engine 17â€™s bumper, the flickering cherry-red glow of her cigarette the only warmth against the pre-dawn chill.  Ash rained down onto the cracked asphalt of the firehouse parking lot, mirroring the fine layer of soot that perpetually coated everything in this gritty corner of South Boston.  The air, thick with the smell of diesel and burnt coffee, vibrated with the low hum of the city slowly waking.  Across the street, the neon sign of O'Malley's, a 24-hour diner and unofficial headquarters of the firehouse, blinked a tired, electric green.  Mia took a final drag, extinguished the cigarette under her boot heel, and looked up at the bruised, pre-sunrise sky.  Another shift, another roll of the dice in a city that never slept, and rarely offered quiet mercies.
