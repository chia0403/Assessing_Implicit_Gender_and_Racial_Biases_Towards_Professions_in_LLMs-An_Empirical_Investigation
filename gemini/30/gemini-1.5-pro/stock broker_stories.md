Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Elias Thorne's forty-second-floor office, blurring the already hazy cityscape of London below.  The Shard, usually a piercing needle against the sky, was tonight a mere phantom, swallowed by the swirling grey. Elias, his tie loosened and his tailored suit jacket slung over the back of his ergonomic chair, tapped a restless rhythm on his mahogany desk with a Montblanc pen.  It was 7:17 pm, well past closing, but the luminescence of his triple-monitor setup cast a cold, artificial daylight across the otherwise darkened office.  The rhythmic staccato of the rain was punctuated only by the low hum of the city and the occasional ping of an overnight news alert on his phone.  Tonight wasn't about closing deals; it was about damage control.  A deal heâ€™d brokered, one involving a revolutionary new energy company called Helios Corp, was tanking faster than the FTSE on Black Monday, and Elias Thorne was about to find out why.
