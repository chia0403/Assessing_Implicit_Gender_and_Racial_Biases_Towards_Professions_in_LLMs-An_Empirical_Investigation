The insistent Vermont wind rattled the leaded panes of Dr. Elias Thorne's dental practice, a sound that usually soothed him but today grated on already frayed nerves.  The late October sky, bruised purple and spitting sleet, mirrored the mood hanging heavy in the small town of Birch Hollow. Elias, all six-foot-two of him, stood staring out at Main Street, his breath fogging the glass.  Birch Hollow was usually picture-postcard New England charm: vibrant fall foliage, the scent of woodsmoke curling from chimney pots, and the gentle murmur of the Birch River winding its way through town.  But today, an unsettling quiet had fallen, a silence broken only by the wind and the rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* emanating from the closed antique shop across the street.  It was a sound that had kept Elias awake for the past two nights, a sound he couldn't quite place, and a sound he was certain shouldn't be coming from Mrs. Henderson's Emporium of Curiosities.
