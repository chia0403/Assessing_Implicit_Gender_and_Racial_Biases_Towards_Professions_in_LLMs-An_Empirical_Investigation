Rain lashed against the window of Amelia Rose Holloway's cramped office, mirroring the tempest brewing in her stomach.  It was April 14th, the eve of Tax Day, and the flickering fluorescent lights of "A-Plus Tax Prep" buzzed with an anxious energy.  The air hung thick with the scent of cheap coffee, stale donuts, and desperation.  Located in a strip mall sandwiched between a laundromat and a perpetually closed-down video rental store, Amelia's office wasn't glamorous, but it was hers.  Outside, the neon glow of a payday loan establishment cast a lurid green light across the rain-slicked asphalt of the parking lot. Inside, stacks of tax forms teetered precariously on every available surface, interspersed with half-empty mugs and the crumpled remains of stress-induced snacking.  Amelia, with her dark circles and frazzled bun, looked as though she hadn't slept in days.  And she hadn't.  This year, Tax Day felt less like a deadline and more like a looming apocalypse.
