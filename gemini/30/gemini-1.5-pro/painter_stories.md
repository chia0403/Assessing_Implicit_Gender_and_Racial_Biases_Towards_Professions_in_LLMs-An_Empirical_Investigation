The salt spray kissed Amelia Zephyr Thorne's face as she perched precariously on the cliff edge, her easel braced against a gust of wind that threatened to send her paintbrushes tumbling into the churning turquoise waters below.  The craggy cliffs of Port Blossom, Maine, were a kaleidoscope of ochre, rust, and deep shadow under the late afternoon sun.  Fishing boats, bobbing like brightly coloured corks, dotted the harbour below, their rhythmic sway mirroring the restless energy that buzzed within Amelia. This was her place, her haven, the wild, untamed beauty of the Maine coast the only muse she'd ever truly needed.  The canvas, still mostly blank, awaited her interpretation of this breathtaking scene, a blank slate yearning for the vibrant life that only Amelia's hand could bestow.
