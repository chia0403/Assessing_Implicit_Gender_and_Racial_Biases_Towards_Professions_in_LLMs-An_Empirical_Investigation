The fluorescent lights of the "Little Wonders Daycare" hummed a monotonous tune, punctuated by the rhythmic clatter of plastic blocks against the linoleum floor. Amelia "Amy" Rose Hawthorne sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear.  The scent of apple juice and disinfectant hung heavy in the air, a familiar aroma that permeated her life five days a week.  Outside, the late October wind howled against the large bay windows, rattling the colourful paper leaves Amy's charges had meticulously taped to the glass.  Inside, however, the chaos reigned supreme.  It was Friday afternoon, naptime had been a resounding failure, and the six four-year-olds under Amyâ€™s care were currently engaged in a spirited debate about the merits of dinosaurs versus unicorns as appropriate imaginary tea party guests.  A small, plastic Tyrannosaurus Rex lay discarded beneath a miniature table draped with a lavender tablecloth, seemingly having lost the argument.  Amy, perched on a tiny blue chair, felt a familiar pang of exhaustion, but a genuine smile tugged at the corners of her mouth.  This vibrant, chaotic world was hers, and she wouldn't trade it for anything.  At least, not most days.
