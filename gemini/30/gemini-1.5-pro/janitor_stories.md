The flickering fluorescent lights of the Zenith BioTech research wing hummed a monotonous B flat, the only sound besides the rhythmic *swoosh* of Elias Thorne’s mop across the polished concrete floor.  It was 3:17 am, the deepest, quietest part of the night, a time when even the lab rats seemed to hold their breath. Outside, nestled in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains, the Oregonian pines whispered secrets to the wind, but inside, the air hung sterile and cold, heavy with the lingering scent of bleach and something else, something Elias couldn’t quite place, something metallic and faintly sweet. Zenith BioTech specialized in cutting-edge pharmaceuticals, treatments so revolutionary they bordered on science fiction. Elias, of course, just cleaned up after the scientists who played God. He pushed his mop bucket down the gleaming hallway, its wheels squeaking a counterpoint to the humming lights, past doors marked with cryptic symbols and biohazard warnings. He was alone, or so he thought.
