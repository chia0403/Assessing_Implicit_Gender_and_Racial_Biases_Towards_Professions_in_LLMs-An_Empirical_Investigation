The flickering fluorescent lights of the D&M Architectural firm hummed a monotonous tune above Amelia Rose Hollowayâ€™s head, a counterpoint to the frantic scratching of her pencil against vellum.  It was a Friday afternoon in late October, the kind where the sun, already low in the sky, cast long, skeletal shadows across the drafting tables scattered around the large, open-plan office. Outside, the wind howled around the corners of the Brutalist concrete building, rattling the large, single-pane windows and hinting at the coming winter. Amelia, hunched over her latest project - blueprints for a new wing of the city hospital -  ignored the distractions. The sharp scent of graphite and the crisp, clean lines emerging beneath her practiced hand were her solace, a welcome escape from the mounting pressure of deadlines and the ever-present anxiety of making a single, irreversible error on the precious, expensive paper.  This was her world, a world of precise measurements, exacting angles, and the silent language of technical drawing. And within this world, for a few precious hours, Amelia reigned supreme.
