The biting November wind whipped through the skeletal frame of the barn, whistling a mournful tune through the gaps where Silas Blackwood’s hammer would soon drive oak pegs.  Sawdust, fine as snow, dusted the rough-hewn timbers and clung to Silas’s thick, wool coat.  He stood, six foot two and solid as the Douglas fir beams he wrestled into place, surveying his work against the backdrop of the bruised purple sky above the Cascade Mountains. Nestled in the Snoqualmie Valley, just outside the small town of North Bend, Washington, the Peterson farm was slowly being reborn after a devastating fire the previous spring.  The air, crisp and carrying the scent of pine needles and damp earth, held the promise of an early snowfall, a prospect that both thrilled and worried Silas.  A white Christmas was picturesque, but finishing the barn before the heavy snows arrived was paramount.
