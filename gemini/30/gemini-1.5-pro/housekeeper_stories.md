The biting November wind rattled the leaded panes of Ashworth Manor, a sound Eliza Mae Higgins had grown accustomed to over her thirty years of service.  The sprawling Tudor mansion, nestled amongst the frost-kissed hills of the Derbyshire Peak District, seemed to sigh with every gust, a mournful symphony only she truly heard.  This morning, however, the usual melancholic song held a sharper edge, a discordant note that prickled the back of Eliza's neck as she polished the grand staircase's mahogany banister. The air hung thick with an unusual stillness, broken only by the rhythmic tick of the grandfather clock in the hall and the whisper of dust motes dancing in the weak sunlight filtering through the stained-glass window depicting St. George slaying the dragon.  Even the manor's usual cacophony of creaks and groans seemed to have fallen silent, as if holding its breath in anticipation of something unseen, something unsettling.
