The biting wind, scented with woodsmoke and the metallic tang of the nearby slaughterhouse, whipped around Elias Thorne's thick woolen coat.  Frost crunched under his heavy boots as he traversed the cobbled lane, his breath clouding the air in ghostly puffs.  It was a bleak December morning in the small, isolated town of Hollow Creek, nestled deep within the shadowed folds of the Greystone Mountains.  Hollow Creek was a place where secrets festered like mold in damp cellars and the sun seemed to struggle to penetrate the perpetual twilight cast by the towering peaks. Elias, a man built like an oak, with hands calloused and stained crimson from his trade, owned the only butcher shop in town, a dimly lit establishment called Thorne & Cleaver.  Its windows, frosted over in intricate patterns, displayed hanging carcasses and strings of plump sausages, a macabre yet enticing tableau for the town's inhabitants.  This morning, however, the usual brisk pre-Christmas trade was absent.  A strange, unsettling quiet hung in the air, thicker than the mountain fog that clung to the rooftops.
