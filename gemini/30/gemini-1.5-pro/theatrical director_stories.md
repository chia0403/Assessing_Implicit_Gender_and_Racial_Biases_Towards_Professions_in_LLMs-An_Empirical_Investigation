The peeling paint of the Grand Majestic Theatre, a sickly shade of custard yellow, seemed to weep in the perpetual drizzle of Grimsborough. Inside, amidst the dust-motes dancing in the weak shafts of light filtering through the grimy skylight, Beatrice Amelia Thorne, a woman whose theatrical flair extended even to her everyday life, surveyed the scene with a sigh that echoed across the empty auditorium.  Rows of plush, burgundy seats, once filled with the murmur of anticipation, now sat in silent judgement of their own decay. The ornate, gilded boxes, havens for Grimsboroughâ€™s elite in a bygone era, were draped in shadowy cobwebs, the ghosts of glamorous patrons seemingly lingering in the stillness. Beatrice, clad in a dramatic, emerald green velvet coat that swallowed her petite frame, tapped a slender, silver-topped cane against the worn wooden stage. This was it. Her last chance. The revival of "The Shadow of the Raven," a long-forgotten gothic melodrama, would either breathe life back into this decaying theatre, and Beatrice's career, or bury them both for good.
