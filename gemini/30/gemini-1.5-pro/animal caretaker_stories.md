The biting November wind whipped at Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's thick wool coat as she trudged across the frosted grounds of the Whispering Pines Animal Sanctuary. Dawn was just beginning to paint the eastern sky a bruised purple, the skeletal branches of the pines etched against it like the veins of a giant hand.  Frost crunched under her sturdy boots, the only sound competing with the mournful hoot of an owl hidden deep in the woods bordering the sanctuary.  Amy exhaled, a puff of white vapor disappearing into the frigid air.  The sanctuary, nestled deep in the Appalachian Mountains of western North Carolina, was a haven for rescued and rehabilitated animals, from majestic bald eagles to timid white-tailed deer.  This morning, however, a different kind of chill settled over Amy. It wasn't just the cold; a sense of unease, prickly and unsettling, clung to her like the clinging mist rising from the nearby creek.  She couldn't shake the feeling that something wasn't right.
