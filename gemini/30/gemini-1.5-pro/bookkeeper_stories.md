The frosted glass of Amelia Thistlewick's office door rattled slightly as a delivery truck rumbled past on cobbled Bleecker Street. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of old paper, dust, and the faint, metallic tang of Amelia's perpetually brewing Earl Grey tea.  Her small office, tucked away above Sal Maglione's bakery, was a haven of organized chaos.  Ledgers lined the shelves, their spines cracked and faded with age, while stacks of receipts and invoices threatened to topple over at any moment.  Amelia, her spectacles perched precariously on her nose, meticulously entered figures into a thick, leather-bound ledger, the rhythmic scratch of her pen the only sound besides the ticking of the antique grandfather clock in the corner.  The year was 1947, and the post-war bustle of New York City seemed a distant hum from her quiet perch above the sweet-smelling bakery.  The world outside was changing rapidly, but within these four walls, Amelia Thistlewick's world remained ordered, predictable, and governed by the unwavering logic of numbers.
