The insistent London drizzle seemed determined to seep through the ill-fitting window frame of Amelia Grace Hawthorne's studio apartment, mirroring the damp chill that had settled in her bones.  Her Shoreditch loft, usually a vibrant explosion of colour and half-finished projects, felt strangely subdued this evening.  Empty takeaway containers littered the small table by the window, testament to a week fuelled by caffeine and deadlines. Amelia, clad in an oversized paint-splattered hoodie and thick wool socks, stared at the glowing screen of her iMac. The cursor blinked mockingly beside the stark white canvas of a new document, a digital abyss mirroring the creative block that had her trapped in its icy grip.  The brief for the rebranding of "Brew & Bloom," a trendy new chain of floral cafes, sat neglected beneath a precariously balanced stack of Pantone colour swatches. Outside, the neon glow of a nearby bar spilled onto the rain-slicked streets, a vibrant counterpoint to the muted grey of Amelia's world.
