The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne as he locked up Thorne Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation, the small shingle swinging precariously above the door.  Nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed Italian restaurant in the sleepy town of Havenwood, Oregon, the clinic was Elias’s life’s work, a testament to his dedication to healing and his stubborn refusal to leave his hometown. Inside, the faint scent of antiseptic and the warmth radiating from the recently used ultrasound machine still lingered.  Outside, the streetlights cast long, skeletal shadows that danced across the wet pavement, the only other movement a lone black cat slinking through an overflowing dumpster. Havenwood was a town shrouded in mist and secrets, a place where everyone knew everyone else's business, and where the quiet hum of normalcy often concealed a current of something darker, something Elias was about to discover.
