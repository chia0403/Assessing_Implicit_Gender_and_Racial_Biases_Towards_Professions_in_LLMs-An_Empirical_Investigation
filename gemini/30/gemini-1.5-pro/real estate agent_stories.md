The crisp October air, scented with woodsmoke and decaying leaves, whipped Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's auburn braid across her face as she wrestled a "SOLD" sign into the unforgiving earth of the front lawn.  The Victorian house loomed behind her, a gothic behemoth of gingerbread trim and leaded glass, perched precariously on a hill overlooking the sleepy town of Hollow Creek, Vermont.  The setting sun cast long, skeletal shadows from the gnarled oak trees that guarded the property, transforming the already imposing house into something vaguely sinister. Amy shivered, pulling her fleece tighter around her.  This was her biggest sale yet – a restoration project that had taken almost a year to close – and despite the unsettling atmosphere, a thrill of triumph coursed through her.  Hollow Creek was known for its picturesque charm and antique homes, but it was also known for its secrets, whispered stories that clung to the fog-laden valleys like cobwebs.  And this house, Whispering Pines, held more than its fair share.
