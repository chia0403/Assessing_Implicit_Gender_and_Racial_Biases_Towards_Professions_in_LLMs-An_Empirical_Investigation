The chipped Formica tabletop, sticky with spilled syrup and the ghosts of a thousand coffee rings, reflected the flickering neon sign of the Starlight Diner.  Rain lashed against the large plate-glass window, blurring the already muted colours of the pre-dawn world outside. Inside, the air was thick with the smell of stale frying oil and brewing coffee, a comforting aroma to Amelia Rose Hawthorne.  She leaned against the counter, idly polishing a coffee cup with a worn, grey dishcloth, her mind as blank as the pristine white mug in her hand.  The Starlight, a beacon of greasy comfort on the edge of Highway 17 just outside of Oakhaven, California, was her kingdom, and at 5:57 am, she was its sole ruler.  The regular early-morning crowd – truckers, weary travellers, and the occasional insomniac – wouldn't arrive for another hour, leaving Amelia in the quiet hum of anticipation that always preceded the breakfast rush.
