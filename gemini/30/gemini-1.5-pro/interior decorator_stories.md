The biting November wind whipped around Eleanor Vance, plastering stray strands of auburn hair across her lipstick-smudged cheek.  She tugged her cashmere scarf tighter, the crimson a stark contrast to the grey stone of the Cartwright Manor, looming before her like a gothic behemoth. Gargoyles perched on the parapets, their stony grimaces echoing the knot of anxiety in Eleanor’s stomach.  The manor, nestled deep in the fog-wreathed Yorkshire moors, was rumored to be haunted, a claim Eleanor usually scoffed at.  But the oppressive atmosphere, the sheer isolation of the place, was starting to chip away at her usual pragmatic facade.  She was here to transform the manor’s dusty, outdated interiors into a modern masterpiece for its new owner, the reclusive tech millionaire, Julian Thorne.  A challenging project, to be sure, but Eleanor thrived on challenges.  Little did she know, this particular challenge extended far beyond choosing the right shade of Farrow & Ball.
