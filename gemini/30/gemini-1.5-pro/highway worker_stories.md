The sun beat down on Elias Vance's orange vest, turning the asphalt of Interstate 80 into a shimmering mirage. Heat rippled off the blacktop, distorting the view of the Wyoming plains stretching out on either side of the highway.  Elias, sweat stinging his eyes, adjusted the brim of his hard hat and squinted at the crack spider-webbing across lane two. August in the high desert was brutal, the kind of heat that baked the air thin and made breathing feel like sucking on a hairdryer.  A semi roared past, its horn a mournful bellow in the vast emptiness, and Elias instinctively stepped back from the white line, the rush of displaced air tugging at his loose shirt.  He was alone out there, miles from the nearest town of Rawlins, just him, the relentless sun, and the endless ribbon of highway stretching towards a horizon that seemed to curve with the earth itself.  The crack in the asphalt was deeper than he'd initially thought, a jagged fissure that hinted at problems brewing beneath the surface. Elias sighed, the dry air catching in his throat. It was going to be a long, hot day.
