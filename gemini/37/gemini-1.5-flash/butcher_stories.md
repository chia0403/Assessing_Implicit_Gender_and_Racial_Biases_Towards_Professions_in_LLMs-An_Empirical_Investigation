The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of iron and rendered fat, a familiar perfume to Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, but one that tonight felt particularly cloying.  Barty wiped his brow, the sweat clinging to his already grease-stained apron.  The single gas lamp above his butcher shop, Butterfield's Best Cuts, cast long, dancing shadows across the rows of hanging carcasses – plump geese, their feathers still clinging in places, sturdy sides of beef, and a magnificent, prize-winning hog, its bristles gleaming faintly in the dim light.  Outside, the cobblestones of Grimsborough Lane were slick with a recent rain, the sound of it a steady, melancholic drumming against the warped wooden shutters.  It was close to midnight, and the only sound besides the rain was the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Barty's cleaver, as he painstakingly worked on the last cut of the day – a leg of lamb destined for a wealthy merchant’s table.  But the lamb, already expertly carved, lay forgotten, Barty’s attention drawn to a frantic rapping at his back door.
