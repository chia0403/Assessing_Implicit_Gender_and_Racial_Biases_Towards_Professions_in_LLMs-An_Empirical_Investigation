The biting wind whipped at Elias Thorne's thick wool coat, stinging his cheeks with icy needles.  He stood perched precariously on the lip of a chasm, the jagged teeth of the Cascade Mountains clawing at the bruised twilight sky. Below him, the ancient Douglas fir, a titan of the forest, lay half-fallen, its gargantuan trunk groaning under the weight of its own crown.

This was Thorne Creek logging camp, a brutal, beautiful place carved into the heart of the Washington wilderness, a place where men wrestled with nature and often lost.  Elias, his face etched with the lines of hardship and sun-weathered resilience, adjusted the worn leather straps of his axe, the steel glinting faintly in the failing light. He had a mountain of work left before nightfall, and the mountain, quite literally, was waiting to test him again.
