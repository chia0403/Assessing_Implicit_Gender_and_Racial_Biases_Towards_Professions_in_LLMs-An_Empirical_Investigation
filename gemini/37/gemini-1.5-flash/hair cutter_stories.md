The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume only Amelia Grace Hawthorne, proprietor of "Shear Perfection," could concoct.  Rain lashed against the tall, gothic windows of her salon, blurring the already indistinct gaslight glow of the cobbled street outside.  Inside, the space was a haven of comforting chaos:  tarnished brass tools gleamed amidst a profusion of brightly colored hair dyes, their pungent aroma battling with the sweetness of the lavender sachets tucked into every corner.  Amelia, her fingers stained a vibrant shade of amethyst from a recent dye job, hummed a melancholic tune as she meticulously sharpened her shears, her dark eyes reflecting the flickering gaslight and the storm raging beyond the glass. The rhythmic *snip, snip, snip* of the honing steel was the only sound louder than the drumming rain.
