The biting wind whipped across the skeletal frame of the unfinished skyscraper, whistling a mournful tune through the steel girders.  Dust, fine as powdered bone, clung to everything:  Amelia “Amy” Hernandez’s work boots, the grit-caked hard hat perched precariously on her head, even the half-eaten sandwich she’d tucked into her pocket.

Below, the relentless clang of metal on metal, the shouts of fellow workers, and the rhythmic hum of heavy machinery formed a chaotic symphony – a soundtrack to Amy’s life, a life spent high above the ground, wrestling with steel and concrete, defying gravity one rivet at a time.
