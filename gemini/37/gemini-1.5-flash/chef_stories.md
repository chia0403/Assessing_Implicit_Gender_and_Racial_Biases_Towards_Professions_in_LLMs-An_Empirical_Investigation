The humid air hung heavy and thick, a living, breathing thing clinging to Chef Jean-Pierre Dubois like a second skin.  The scent of roasting garlic and simmering saffron, usually a source of comfort, tonight felt suffocating, mirroring the pressure building in his chest.  The kitchen of "Le Papillon," his once-celebrated restaurant nestled in the heart of the ancient, cobbled streets of Nice, was a battlefield.  Not of knives and spatulas, though those were certainly present in chaotic abundance, but of simmering resentments, whispered anxieties, and the ever-present threat of a catastrophic kitchen fire â€“ a real and ever-present danger in this cramped, century-old building.  Tonight, however, felt different, even worse than usual.  The air crackled with something beyond the usual pre-service tension. Tonight, Jean-Pierre felt the taste of disaster on his tongue.
