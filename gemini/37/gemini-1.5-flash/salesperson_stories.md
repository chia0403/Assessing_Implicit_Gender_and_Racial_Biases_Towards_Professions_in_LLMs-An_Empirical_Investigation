The fluorescent lights of the "Bargain Bonanza" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Hernandez's carefully constructed smile.  Amelia, a woman whose age was perpetually somewhere between thirty and forty, depending on the lighting and the generosity of the customer, adjusted the tiny diamond stud in her left ear.  The air hung thick with the scent of cheap air freshener, vaguely floral but mostly reminiscent of a damp gym sock.  Rows upon rows of discounted appliances – waffle irons with mysteriously sticky plates, blenders with suspiciously wobbly bases, and televisions that seemed to possess a permanently static-ridden aura – stretched before her like a battlefield of forgotten dreams. This was Amelia's domain, her kingdom of slightly-used and deeply discounted electronics, and today, she was determined to conquer it.
