The biting wind whipped Elias Thorneâ€™s grey beard across his chapped lips, stinging like the icy spray from the churning North Sea.  He hunched deeper into his thick wool coat, the rough fabric scratching against the calloused skin of his arms, skin hardened by decades spent wrestling with granite and the unforgiving elements.
