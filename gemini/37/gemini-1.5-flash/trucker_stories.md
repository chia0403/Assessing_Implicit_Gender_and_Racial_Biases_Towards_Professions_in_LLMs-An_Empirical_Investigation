The biting Wyoming wind howled a mournful tune around Jebediah "Jeb" Stone's rig, a symphony of icy grit against the polished chrome and the groan of the aging eighteen-wheeler.  He hunkered deeper into his worn leather seat, the flickering dashboard lights painting dancing shadows on his weathered face.  Outside, the I-80 stretched endlessly westward, a ribbon of black asphalt snaking through a landscape bleached white by a fresh blizzard.  The snow, driven by a relentless wind, obscured everything beyond the immediate reach of his headlights â€“ a swirling, ethereal curtain separating Jeb from the rest of the world. The only sounds louder than the wind were the rhythmic thump of the tires and the low growl of his trusty engine, a comforting rumble in the face of the unforgiving wilderness.  Jeb checked his mirror, the swirling snow briefly revealing the skeletal silhouette of a distant mountain range, their peaks disappearing into the churning grey sky.  Tonight, the road was his lonely kingdom, and he, its solitary king.
