The recycled air hung thick and faintly metallic in the cabin, a familiar perfume to Seraphina “Sera” Moreau.  She adjusted the tiny, almost invisible earpiece, the hum of the Boeing 747-8 a low thrum against her skull, a constant companion for the last ten years of her life.

This flight, Qantas 327 from Sydney to Los Angeles, was almost over, but the quiet hum of exhaustion that thrummed beneath the surface of her usual professional composure hinted that the real turbulence was yet to come.
