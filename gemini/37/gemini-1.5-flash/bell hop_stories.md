The brass spittoon gleamed under the weak, flickering gaslight, reflecting the grime clinging to the ornate mahogany counter of the Grand Majestic Hotel.  A faint, cloying scent of lilies and stale beer hung in the air, a perfume only slightly less pungent than the aroma wafting from the kitchen, a symphony of burnt sugar and simmering resentment.  Twenty-year-old  Bartholomew "Barty" Higgins, his bellhop's uniform a slightly-too-tight testament to a recent growth spurt, wrestled a mountain of luggage – a chaotic jumble of steamer trunks, hat boxes, and an alarmingly oversized cage containing what sounded suspiciously like a ferret – onto the already groaning luggage cart.  The Grand Majestic, once the jewel of the city, now felt more like a slowly decaying tooth, its grandeur tarnished by time, neglect, and the lingering memory of a scandalous fire that had claimed a wing several years ago.  The air thrummed with a low, almost palpable anxiety, a feeling Barty knew as well as the pattern of the worn carpet under his worn shoes. Tonight, however, something felt different, something prickled at the edges of his usual weary acceptance.
