The only new thing about Higgins' Hairs was the persistent, unsettling tremor that had begun shaking the floorboards three days ago, a vibration that seemed to emanate from deep within the earth itself, coinciding with the arrival of the enigmatic Mr. Silas Blackwood and his unsettlingly quiet entourage.
