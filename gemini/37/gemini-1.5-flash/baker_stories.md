The pre-dawn chill clung to Elara Thistlewick like a damp shroud as she unlocked the bakery doors.  Frost, delicate as spun sugar, clung to the windowpanes of "The Crumb & Kettle," its icy breath blurring the already dim morning light.  The cobbled street outside, usually a lively tapestry of hurried footsteps and cheerful chatter, was deserted, the only sound the rhythmic *clink-clink* of Elara’s own boots against the frozen stones.  The air, sharp and clean, carried the faintest scent of woodsmoke and something sweeter – the promise of freshly baked bread, already rising warmly in the oven within.  Inside, the comforting aroma of cinnamon, yeast, and melting butter battled the icy grip of the outside world, a delicious and hopeful counterpoint to the biting November air of the quaint, snow-dusted village of Oakhaven.
