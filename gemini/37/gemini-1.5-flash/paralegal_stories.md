The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Hernandez’s hands, the lukewarm coffee doing little to dispel the November chill that seeped through the drafty windows of the Legal Eagle’s office. Rain lashed against the glass, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Amelia herself.  Outside, the neon glow of a liquor store cast a lurid sheen on the slick cobblestones of Bleecker Street, a stark contrast to the dusty, overflowing bookshelves and the general air of organized chaos that characterized her workspace.  The scent of old paper and stale cigarettes hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume in the cramped, rent-controlled office that had been home to the Legal Eagle, a flamboyant, if somewhat dishevelled, criminal defense attorney named  Bartholomew “Barty” Quill, for the past thirty years. Tonight, however, even the comforting familiarity felt oppressive.  Amelia, a paralegal with a penchant for order and a secret yearning for a life beyond overflowing file cabinets, knew this case was different. This case felt…wrong.
