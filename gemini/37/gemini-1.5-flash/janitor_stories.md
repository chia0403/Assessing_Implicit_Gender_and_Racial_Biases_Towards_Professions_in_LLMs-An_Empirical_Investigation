The fluorescent lights of the Blackwood Academy hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Elias Thorne's nightly ritual.  Dust motes, illuminated like tiny constellations, danced in the beams as he pushed his mop across the polished marble floor of the grand hallway.  The air, thick with the lingering scent of old books and floor wax, held a faint undercurrent of something else â€“ the ghostly echo of a thousand whispered secrets, a hundred years of laughter and heartbreak echoing from the hallowed halls.  Blackwood Academy, a gothic monstrosity of dark stone and towering spires, stood silent now, its students tucked away in their dormitories, leaving Elias Thorne, the night janitor, sole keeper of its secrets.  Tonight, however, the silence felt heavier than usual, punctuated only by the rhythmic squeak of his mop and the distant, almost imperceptible, drip, drip, drip of a leaky faucet somewhere deep within the labyrinthine building.
