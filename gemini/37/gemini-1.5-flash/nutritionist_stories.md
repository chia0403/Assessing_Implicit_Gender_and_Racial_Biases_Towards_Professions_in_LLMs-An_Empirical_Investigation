The chipped paint of the fire escape flaked onto Dr. Eleanor Vance’s sensible brown loafers. Below, the cacophony of New York City – a symphony of honking taxis, screeching brakes, and the distant wail of a siren – was a muted counterpoint to the quiet hum of her own anxieties.  Eleanor, a registered dietitian with a PhD in nutritional biochemistry, perched precariously on the rusty metal, a half-eaten kale and quinoa salad forgotten on the windowsill of her cramped, rent-controlled apartment.  The city stretched before her, a concrete jungle teeming with both opportunity and, she suspected, a whole lot of nutritional despair.  The setting sun cast long shadows across the brick buildings, painting the cityscape in hues of orange and bruised purple, a dramatic backdrop to her simmering professional frustration.  She’d spent the last three months trying to convince the notoriously unhealthy residents of her building to swap their bodega cheesesteaks for something, well, marginally less artery-clogging.  So far, success had been as elusive as a perfectly ripe avocado in January.
