The chipped paint on the windowsill, a faded robin's egg blue fighting a losing battle against decades of grime, was the first clue.  But Amelia Hawthorne, owner and principal designer of "Hawthorne Hues," already knew what she was walking into.  The realtor's optimistic description of "charming character" had been a thinly veiled euphemism for "needs a complete gutting."  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp plaster and forgotten dreams, a stark contrast to the crisp autumn air that swirled outside the decaying Victorian mansion perched precariously on the cliff overlooking the churning grey sea.  Amelia shivered, less from the chill wind whistling through the broken panes and more from the sheer daunting scale of the project before her.  This wasn't just a renovation; it was an exorcism, a stripping away of years of neglect and sadness, leaving only the bones of a beautiful home waiting to be resurrected.
