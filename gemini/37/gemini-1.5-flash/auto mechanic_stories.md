The greasy scent of motor oil and burnt coffee clung to the air like a second skin in Benny "The Wrench" Rodriguez's garage.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single bare bulb hanging precariously from the ceiling, danced in the wavering light, each a tiny, ephemeral sun in the cavernous space.  Worn tools, their handles smooth from years of use, hung haphazardly from pegboards, a testament to Bennyâ€™s decades spent wrestling with temperamental engines.  Outside, the relentless Arizona sun beat down on the corrugated iron roof, turning the metal into a shimmering, oven-like expanse.  Today, however, the heat was the least of Benny's worries.  A battered, mud-caked pickup truck, its hood up and revealing a snarling engine compartment, sat ominously in the center of the garage, promising a long, frustrating day.
