The dawn mist clung to the manicured lawns of Willow Creek Estates like a shroud, clinging to the dew-kissed blades of grass and obscuring the sculpted hedges until the rising sun finally burned it away.  Amelia “Mia” Hawthorne, her breath puffing white clouds in the crisp morning air, adjusted the worn leather strap of her tool belt.  The scent of damp earth and freshly cut roses filled her lungs, a familiar and comforting aroma that had been a constant companion since she was a girl helping her grandfather tend his humble flowerbeds.  This morning, however, the usual tranquility of Willow Creek was shattered.  A dark, almost oily sheen slicked the surface of the usually pristine pond at the centre of the development, and a peculiar, metallic tang hung heavy in the air, a smell far removed from the sweetness of honeysuckle and roses.  This wasn't just another day of trimming hedges and weeding flowerbeds; something was terribly wrong.
