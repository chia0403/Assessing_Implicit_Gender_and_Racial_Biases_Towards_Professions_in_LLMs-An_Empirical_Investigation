The scent of vanilla bean and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Aurelia "Auri" Hawthorne.  It clung to her apron, a flour-dusted, buttercream-stained testament to a long day spent coaxing roses from fondant and sculpting miniature unicorns from marzipan.  Auri, owner and sole operator of "Sweet Surrender Cakes," stood amidst a chaotic but comforting landscape of half-finished cakes, towering stacks of pastel-colored boxes, and an impressive arsenal of piping bags nestled in a rainbow spectrum on the stainless steel counter.  Her tiny shop, tucked away on a cobbled side street in the historic district of Charleston, South Carolina, was a riot of color and sugary delights.  Gas lamps flickered outside, casting a warm glow on the rain-slicked bricks, a stark contrast to the cool, clinical gleam of the industrial refrigerator humming quietly in the corner.  Tonight, however, the usual sweet symphony of her bakery was punctuated by the frantic ticking of the clock on the wall â€“ a deadline loomed, and it was a big one.
