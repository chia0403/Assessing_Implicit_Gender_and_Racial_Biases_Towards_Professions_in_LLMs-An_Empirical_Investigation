The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Amy” Hernandez’s auburn hair across her face as she huddled deeper into her threadbare coat.  Rain, a relentless, icy drizzle, plastered her already damp notepad to her chest.  The air hung thick with the smell of salt, rotting seaweed, and something faintly metallic – the lingering scent of a tragedy.  Amy stood on the windswept cliffs overlooking the churning grey expanse of the Atlantic, the jagged silhouette of Widow’s Point jutting out like a skeletal finger into the storm.  Below, the wreckage of the *Seraphina*, a once-proud fishing trawler, lay scattered amongst the rocks, a grim testament to the tempest that had ravaged the coast of Cape Cod just hours before.  This wasn't Amy's first time covering a maritime disaster, but the eerie silence hanging over the scene, broken only by the mournful cry of gulls and the relentless crash of waves, felt different.  This felt…personal.
