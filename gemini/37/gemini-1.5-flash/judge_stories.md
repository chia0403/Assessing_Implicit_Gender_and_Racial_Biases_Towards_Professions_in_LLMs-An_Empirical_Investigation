The air hung thick and humid, a clinging shroud draped over the sprawling, moss-covered oaks that guarded the courthouse grounds of New Hope, Louisiana.  Cicadas buzzed a relentless, maddening chorus, their sound a counterpoint to the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in Judge Evangeline Dupré’s chambers.  Dust motes danced in the slivers of sunlight slicing through the stained-glass window depicting a somewhat wilted-looking magnolia, a fitting emblem for the languid, almost suffocating atmosphere of the late summer afternoon.  Evangeline, her name echoing the faded grandeur of the town itself, leaned back in her worn leather chair, the scent of aged paper and simmering resentment filling the room almost as heavily as the humid air.  A half-empty glass of iced tea, its condensation forming a miniature lake on her mahogany desk, sat beside a stack of files promising a long and probably unpleasant evening.
