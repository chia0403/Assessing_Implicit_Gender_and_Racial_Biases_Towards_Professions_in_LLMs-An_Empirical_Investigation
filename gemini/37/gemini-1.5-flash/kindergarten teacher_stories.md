The chipped paint of the crayon-scrawled wall seemed to vibrate with the chaotic energy of twenty-five five-year-olds.  Ms. Eleanor Vance, a woman whose perpetually cheerful smile was only slightly strained by the sheer volume of tiny humans currently attempting to build a tower out of blocks that defied all known laws of physics, sighed a sound that was half-exasperation, half-fond amusement.  Sunlight streamed through the tall windows of Room 104 at Sunnyside Elementary, illuminating a landscape littered with miniature plastic dinosaurs, half-finished art projects depicting inexplicably purple elephants, and the inevitable scattering of stray goldfish crackers.  The air hung thick with the scent of glitter glue, slightly damp carpet, and the indefinable aroma of a room where small, enthusiastic humans had spent the better part of the morning.  Today, however, the usual kindergarten cacophony was punctuated by an unsettling silence â€“ a silence that, Eleanor knew from years of experience, promised something far more interesting (and potentially disastrous) than a peaceful afternoon nap.
