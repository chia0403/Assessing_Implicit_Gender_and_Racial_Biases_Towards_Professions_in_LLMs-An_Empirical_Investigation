The humid air hung thick and heavy, a shimmering veil over the mirrored walls of "Body & Soul Fitness."  Sweat beaded on the forehead of  Isabelle "Izzy" Moreau as she surveyed her 6 AM Spin class, a kaleidoscope of glistening limbs and determined faces.  The rhythmic thump of house music vibrated through the floor, a primal beat that mirrored the collective exertion in the room.  Izzy, with her fiery red hair pulled back in a tight braid and a determined set to her jaw, adjusted her microphone, a small smile playing on her lips. This was her domain, her sanctuary, a place where she sculpted bodies and, more importantly, transformed lives.  The scent of sweat and citrus cleaner mingled in the air, a surprisingly pleasant aroma to her.  Today's class was particularly challenging, a grueling hill climb designed to push even her most seasoned athletes to their limits.  The digital clock on the wall blinked 6:00 AM sharp.  It was time.
