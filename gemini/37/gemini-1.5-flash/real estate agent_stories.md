The salt spray kissed Amelia Jean Holloway's face as she wrestled the stubborn For Sale sign into the unforgiving wind.  It bucked and strained, threatening to tear free from its weathered wooden post, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  The October sky over the craggy cliffs of Cullercoats, Northumberland, mirrored the turmoil â€“ bruised purples and angry greys battling for dominance.  Amelia, however, wasn't fretting over the weather.  The real storm was the impending auction of Seabreeze Cottage, a charming, if slightly dilapidated, fisherman's dwelling perched precariously on the edge of the cliff path.  Its quirky charm usually proved a selling point, but this time, a dark, unsettling history clung to its peeling paint like stubborn barnacles.  And Amelia Jean Holloway, with her sharp wit and even sharper instincts, knew this sale would be anything but straightforward.
