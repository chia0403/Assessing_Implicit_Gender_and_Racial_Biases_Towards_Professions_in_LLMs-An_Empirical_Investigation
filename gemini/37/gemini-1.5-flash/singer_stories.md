The chipped porcelain teacup warmed Seraphina "Sera" Nightingale's fingers, the lukewarm chamomile doing little to soothe the tremor that ran through her.  Rain lashed against the stained-glass window of her attic studio, mimicking the chaotic storm brewing inside her.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single bare bulb hanging precariously from the ceiling, danced in the gloom, a swirling ballet mirroring the anxieties that threatened to overwhelm her.

Tonight, despair held a distinct advantage.  Outside, the city of Prague hummed with a life Sera felt increasingly disconnected from, a life that had once revolved around the soaring notes she poured from her soul, but now felt miles away.
