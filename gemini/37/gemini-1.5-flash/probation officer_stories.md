The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Mia” Holloway’s hair across her face as she navigated the cracked asphalt of Oakhaven’s forgotten corner.  Rows of identical, grey-brick townhouses hunched together like weary shoulders, their windows like vacant eyes staring out at the skeletal branches of the sycamores lining the street.  A single flickering streetlight cast long, skeletal shadows that danced with the swirling leaves, creating a scene both bleak and beautiful.  Mia pulled her worn wool coat tighter, the damp chill seeping through the thin fabric.  The air smelled of damp earth and something faintly acrid – burnt sugar, maybe, or something less pleasant.  This was her domain, the fringes of Oakhaven where hope went to die slowly, a place where Mia, a probation officer for the city’s overburdened Department of Correctional Services, spent most of her days wrestling with the ghosts of bad choices and the fragile promises of redemption.  Tonight, she was here to see Elias Thorne, a case that felt like a particularly stubborn knot in the already tangled tapestry of her workload.
