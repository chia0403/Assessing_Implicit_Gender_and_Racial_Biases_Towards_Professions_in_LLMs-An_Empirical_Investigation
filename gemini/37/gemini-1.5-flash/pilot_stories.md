The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful song around Captain Evelyn "Evie" Reed’s battered Cessna 185, rattling the already precarious load of salmon strapped to the pontoons.  Below, the Chugach Mountains clawed at the bruised twilight sky, their snow-capped peaks disappearing into a swirling curtain of grey.  Evie shivered, pulling her worn leather jacket tighter, the scent of pine and fish mingling with the sharp tang of the frozen air.  The radio crackled with static – a familiar, unsettling companion on flights like these, ferrying precious cargo across the unforgiving wilderness between Anchorage and the remote fishing villages scattered along the Kenai Peninsula.  Tonight, however, the usual hum of the engine felt strangely muted, a premonition whispering on the wind.
