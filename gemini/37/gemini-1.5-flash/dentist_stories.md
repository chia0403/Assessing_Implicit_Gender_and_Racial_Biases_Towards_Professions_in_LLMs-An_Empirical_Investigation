The biting wind howled a mournful tune around the craggy peaks of the Scottish Highlands, rattling the single-pane windows of Dr. Alistair Finch's surprisingly modern dental practice.  Nestled incongruously between a crumbling stone croft and a brightly painted, tourist-trap gift shop selling "Highland Heather Honey" (mostly imported, Alistair suspected), the practice was a gleaming white beacon of improbable modernity. Inside, the air hummed with the low thrum of sterilizers and the faint, antiseptic scent of clove, a stark contrast to the wild, untamed landscape beyond.  Alistair Finch, a man whose hands were as deft at manipulating delicate porcelain veneers as they were at coaxing recalcitrant sheep out of boggy ditches (a surprisingly useful skill in his isolated location), peered out at the storm, a sigh escaping his lips as he prepared for another day filled with the unique challenges of dentistry in the remote village of Glencoe.
