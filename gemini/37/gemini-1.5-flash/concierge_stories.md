The brass nameplate on the mahogany desk gleamed under the soft, apricot-hued light of the Belle Époque lobby:  *Armand Jean-Luc Dubois, Concierge*.  Armand, however, was not admiring his own polished image.

Rain lashed against the arched windows of the Hôtel de la Lumière, blurring the Parisian cityscape into a shimmering watercolour.  The hotel, a venerable institution tucked away on a quiet side street near the Louvre, hummed with a subdued energy – the hushed whispers of wealthy guests, the clinking of ice in crystal glasses, and the barely audible whir of the antique elevator.  Tonight, however, the usual refined murmur was punctuated by a distinct, unsettling silence emanating from the penthouse suite – the one occupied by Madame Evangeline Dubois, a woman whose eccentricities were as legendary as her fortune.
