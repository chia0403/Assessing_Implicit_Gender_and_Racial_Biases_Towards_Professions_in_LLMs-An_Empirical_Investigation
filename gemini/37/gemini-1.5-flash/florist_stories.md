The scent of lilies, heavy and cloying, hung thick in the air, a stark contrast to the crisp autumn morning outside.  Rain lashed against the stained-glass windows of "Petals & Promises," blurring the already muted colours of the cobbled street beyond.  Inside, amongst the riot of blooms – vibrant sunflowers jostling with blushing roses, deep purple asters drooping gracefully –  Amelia Grace Hawthorne meticulously arranged a funeral wreath, her nimble fingers weaving sprigs of rosemary and lavender into the somber design.  The bell above the shop door jingled, a sharp, unwelcome sound that cut through the quiet concentration Amelia had cultivated.  The chill wind carried with it the promise of more rain, and a distinct scent of woodsmoke and something else… something unsettlingly sweet.
