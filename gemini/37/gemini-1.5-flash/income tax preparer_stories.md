The fluorescent lights of Beatrice "Bea" Willowbrook's tiny office hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the frantic tapping of her fingers on the keyboard.  The air, thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, hung heavy and still.  Stacks of tax forms, precariously balanced like teetering Jenga towers, threatened to topple at any moment.  February in Poughkeepsie was notoriously bleak, a gray smear across the landscape mirrored by the equally gray expressions of Bea's clients who shuffled in, burdened not just by winter coats but by the weight of their financial anxieties.  Outside, a biting wind rattled the windowpanes of her cramped office above a laundromat, a fitting backdrop to the annual ritual of tax season, a time when even the most optimistic found their spirits dampened by the prospect of facing the IRS.
