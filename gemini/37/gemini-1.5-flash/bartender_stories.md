The chipped Formica bar top gleamed under the sickly yellow light of the "Rusty Mug," reflecting the faint sheen of sweat on Elias Thorne's forehead.  Elias, a man whose age was as ambiguous as the provenance of the cheap whiskey he served, wiped down the counter with a rag that had seen better decades.  The air hung thick with the aroma of stale beer, spilled bourbon, and the faint, almost imperceptible scent of desperation â€“ a perfume unique to the late-night clientele of this forgotten corner of the city. Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the neon glow of the liquor store across the street into a hazy, crimson smear.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune, a fitting soundtrack to the weary sighs and hushed conversations that echoed within the dimly lit tavern.  Tonight, however, the usual melancholic hum of the Rusty Mug was punctuated by an unsettling silence, a pregnant pause before the storm truly broke.
