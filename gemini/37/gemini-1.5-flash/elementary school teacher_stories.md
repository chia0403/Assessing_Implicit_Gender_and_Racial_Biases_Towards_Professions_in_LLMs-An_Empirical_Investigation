The chipped paint of Mrs. Eleanor Vance’s classroom desk flaked onto the already cluttered surface: a half-eaten granola bar, a stack of graded papers smelling faintly of crayons and desperation, and a miniature, slightly squashed plastic unicorn, inexplicably wearing a tiny knitted hat.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sunbeams slicing through the grimy windowpanes of Room 2B at Willow Creek Elementary.  Outside, the relentless drone of cicadas battled the distant wail of a fire truck – a soundtrack as familiar to Eleanor as the rhythmic squeak of her ancient chair.  Willow Creek was a town clinging stubbornly to its rural past, a place where change arrived slowly, like the creeping ivy that snaked its way up the brick walls of the school, mirroring the steady, sometimes agonizing, progress of her students.  Today, however, the usual calm of Willow Creek was about to be shattered, a fact Eleanor Vance, with her weary smile and perpetually coffee-stained cardigan, was utterly unaware of.
