The chipped turquoise paint of Serenity Nails peeled away from the windowsill like sunburnt skin, mirroring the frayed edges of Evangeline Moreau's patience.  Evangeline, a woman whose name suggested a serene disposition utterly at odds with her current state of mind, sighed, the sound barely audible above the insistent whine of the city traffic outside.  Rain lashed against the glass, blurring the neon glow of the "24-Hour Pharmacy" across the street into a lurid, watery smear.  Inside, the tiny nail salon was a chaotic ballet of half-finished manicures, overflowing tubs of brightly coloured polish, and the lingering scent of acetone â€“ a pungent perfume that clung to Evangeline's clothes like a second skin, a constant reminder of the relentless rhythm of her days.  The only other sounds were the rhythmic tick-tock of a broken clock in the corner and the muffled sobs coming from the curtained pedicure station.
