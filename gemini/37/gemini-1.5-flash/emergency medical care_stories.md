The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Mia” Hernandez’s hair across her face as she wrestled the stretcher into the back of the ambulance.  Rain, slick and relentless, plastered her already damp uniform to her skin.  The air hung heavy with the metallic tang of blood and the acrid scent of woodsmoke, a grim perfume that clung to everything in the shadowed, rain-lashed alleyway behind the Blue Moon Tavern.  Sirens wailed in the distance, a mournful counterpoint to the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Mia’s own heart, a sound she’d learned to both ignore and rely on in equal measure during her five years as a paramedic with the Chicago Emergency Medical Services.  Tonight, however, the rhythm felt frantic, a frantic echo of the chaos unfolding before her. The victim, a young man barely clinging to consciousness, lay sprawled amongst shattered glass and overturned garbage bins, his breathing shallow and ragged. This wasn't just another Friday night in the city; this felt… different.
