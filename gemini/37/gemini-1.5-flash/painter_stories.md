The salt spray stung Elara Vance’s face as she wrestled her easel into position, the wind threatening to topple it onto the jagged rocks below.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and seaweed, whipped her auburn hair across her eyes, blurring the already hazy view of the churning Atlantic.  She anchored the easel with a grunt, the rough-hewn wooden legs digging into the windswept clifftop overlooking the desolate beauty of the Cornish coast.  Below, the grey-green waves crashed against the black rocks with a relentless fury, a symphony of nature's untamed power that both terrified and inspired her.  Today, Elara planned to capture it all – the tempestuous sea, the dramatic cliffs, and the brooding sky – on her canvas.  Her palette, already prepared with vibrant hues of cerulean, emerald, and storm-grey, lay waiting, a testament to the internal storm mirroring the external one.
