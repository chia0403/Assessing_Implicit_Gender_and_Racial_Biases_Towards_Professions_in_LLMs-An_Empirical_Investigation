Snow, thick and unforgiving, piled high against the wrought-iron gates, obscuring the already indistinct outline of the gothic architecture.  The only sound was the mournful creak of the wind whistling through the broken panes of the manor's numerous windows, a symphony of decay accompanying Eleanor's hesitant steps.  Inside, she knew, waited a mystery shrouded in shadows as deep as the winter night.
