The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Isabella “Izzy” Diaz’s office, a rhythm that mirrored the frantic drumming of her own heart.  It wasn't the storm itself that set her nerves on edge, though the wind howled like a banshee outside, rattling the loose windowpanes. No, it was the photograph spread across her scarred, oak desk – a blurry image of a young woman with eyes that held a chilling emptiness, clutched in the hand of a man whose face was deliberately obscured by shadow.  The woman was missing, and the only clue Izzy had was a crumpled, water-damaged business card bearing the name "Silas Blackwood" and the address of a dilapidated warehouse district known locally as "The Gutters," a labyrinth of crumbling brick and forgotten dreams nestled between the gleaming skyscrapers of downtown San Francisco.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee, old paper, and the ever-present tang of the Pacific, a scent that tonight felt heavy with unspoken secrets.
