The biting November wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vanceâ€™s auburn hair across her face as she wrestled the heavy oak door of the Alder Creek Animal Clinic open.  The scent of pine and damp earth, usually comforting, was today overlaid with a sharp, metallic tang that prickled her nostrils.  Alder Creek, nestled deep in the Oregon Cascades, was a picture postcard town in the summer, its charm amplified by the vibrant green of the surrounding forest.  But winter brought a different kind of beauty, a stark, icy elegance that could be breathtakingly stunning, and brutally unforgiving.  Tonight, it felt more like the latter. The clinic, a cozy, two-story building with snow clinging to its gabled roof, felt less like a haven and more like a lonely outpost against the encroaching wilderness. Inside, the only light came from a single lamp illuminating the reception area, casting long, dancing shadows that mirrored the anxious flutter in Eleanor's stomach.  Something was wrong.  She could feel it in the icy air, smell it in the metallic tang, and sense it in the unnerving quiet that usually hummed with the comforting sounds of purring cats and barking dogs.
