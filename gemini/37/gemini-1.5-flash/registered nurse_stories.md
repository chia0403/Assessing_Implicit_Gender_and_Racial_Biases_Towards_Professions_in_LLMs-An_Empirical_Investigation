The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne's dark hair across her face as she hurried down the rain-slicked cobblestones of Charleston's French Quarter.  The scent of magnolias, usually a comforting perfume, was overwhelmed tonight by the sharp tang of rain and something elseâ€¦ something metallic, almost blood-like.  Gas lamps flickered, casting long, distorted shadows that danced with the restless rhythm of the approaching storm.  Amelia, her crisp white nurse's uniform clinging damply to her frame, pulled her worn leather satchel tighter against her chest.  The rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* of her own heart beat in counterpoint to the frantic drumming of the rain on the ancient brick buildings.  Tonight, the usually enchanting charm of Charleston felt distinctly sinister.  She was late, terribly late, and the shadowed alley ahead seemed to promise nothing but trouble.
