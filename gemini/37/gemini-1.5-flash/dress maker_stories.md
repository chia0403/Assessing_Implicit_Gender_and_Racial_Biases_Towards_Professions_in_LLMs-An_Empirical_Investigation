The scent of lavender and old silk hung heavy in the air, a comforting perfume that clung to the dusty velvet curtains and the mahogany sewing table in Aurelia Genevieve Beaumont's atelier.  Sunlight, fractured by the leaded-glass windows of her small, attic shop, dappled the bolts of fabric stacked haphazardly against the walls â€“ shimmering silks in emerald and sapphire, crisp linens in ivory and blush, and a riot of patterned cottons that whispered stories of faraway lands.  Dust motes danced in the golden beams, each one a tiny, glittering distraction from the intricate embroidery Aurelia was painstakingly stitching onto a delicate gown of ivory lace.  Outside, the cobblestones of the Parisian street echoed with the hurried footsteps of the city, a stark contrast to the quiet, almost sacred, calm within her haven.  But today, the usual peaceful rhythm of her work was about to be shattered.
