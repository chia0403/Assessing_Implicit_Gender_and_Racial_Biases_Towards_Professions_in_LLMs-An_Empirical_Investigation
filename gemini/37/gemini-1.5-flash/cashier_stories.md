The fluorescent lights of "Quick Stop" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Elara Vance's Tuesday night.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the already indistinct neon glow of the liquor store across the street.  The air inside smelled faintly of stale coffee and desperation, a familiar perfume Elara had grown accustomed to during her three years working the night shift.  Tonight, however, the usual quiet hum of boredom was punctuated by a rhythmic *drip, drip, drip* from somewhere near the leaky ceiling, a sound that mirrored the slow, agonizing leak in Elara's own patience.  The digital clock above the register blinked 11:53 PM, promising only another seventeen minutes of this soul-crushing monotony before her blessed release.
