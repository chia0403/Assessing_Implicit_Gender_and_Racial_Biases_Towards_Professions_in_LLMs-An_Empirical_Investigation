The biting November wind whipped across the manicured lawns of Blackwood Manor, carrying with it the scent of decaying leaves and a faint, almost imperceptible, metallic tang.  Elias Thorne, his breath puffing out in white clouds, hunched deeper into his worn, tweed jacket.  Blackwood Manor itself, a gothic behemoth of grey stone, loomed over him, its countless windows like vacant eyes staring out across the sprawling estate. Elias, the groundskeeper,  knew every inch of this sprawling property – from the whispering willows by the lake to the crumbling gazebo hidden deep within the overgrown rose garden –  knew it as intimately as he knew the lines on his own weathered hands.  Tonight, however, a different kind of unease settled in his bones, heavier than the damp chill clinging to his clothes.  It wasn't the usual pre-winter gloom; this felt… sharper.  Something was wrong, something Elias couldn't quite place, something that prickled at the edges of his senses, whispering on the wind.
