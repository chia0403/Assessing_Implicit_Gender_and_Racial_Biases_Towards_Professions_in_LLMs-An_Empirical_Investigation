Rain lashed against the large bay window overlooking Bleecker Street, blurring the already hazy neon glow of the city into a shimmering, ethereal curtain.  Inside, however, the salon buzzed with a controlled chaos – the rhythmic snip-snip of shears, the low hum of the hair dryers, the gossipy chatter of clients and the clinking of teacups.  It was a Thursday night in Greenwich Village, and Rella, as always, was in the eye of the storm.
