The relentless LA sun beat down on Isabella “Izzy” Rodriguez’s neck, turning the already stifling air inside her vintage Mustang convertible into a shimmering oven.  Sweat beaded on her forehead, mirroring the tiny droplets clinging to the condensation rings left on the cracked leather dashboard.  Izzy, a woman whose directorial debut, *Crimson Dawn*, had unexpectedly exploded onto the indie scene two years prior, was late.  Again.  Not tragically, spectacularly late – the kind of lateness that involved frantic calls from her exasperated producer, a mountain of unanswered emails, and a gnawing sense of impending doom that only seemed to heighten with each passing red light on Sunset Boulevard.  This wasn't just any meeting; this was a meeting with *Silas Thorne*, the enigmatic billionaire whose production company held the keys to her next project, a sprawling sci-fi epic she’d poured her soul into crafting.  The project that could either propel her to A-list status or send her career spiralling into the dusty, forgotten corners of Hollywood graveyard.  The air hung thick with the scent of exhaust fumes and impending disaster, perfectly encapsulating Izzy’s current mood.
