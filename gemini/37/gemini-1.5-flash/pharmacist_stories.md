The chipped porcelain sink in the back room of "Apothecary & Quill" felt colder than usual against Elara Vance's cheek.  The November air, thick with the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth, seeped through the ill-fitting windowpane, whistling a mournful tune around the cracked glass.  Elara, a woman whose life was usually measured in millilitres and milligrams, felt the chill seep deeper, settling in her bones with a bone-deep weariness that even a double shot of her grandmother's potent ginger elixir couldn't seem to chase away.  Outside, the cobblestones of Oakhaven, a town clinging precariously to the edge of the Whispering Moors, glistened under a bruised, purple twilight.  The only light in the shop came from the single gas lamp sputtering weakly above the oak counter, casting long, dancing shadows that made the rows of apothecary jars seem to watch her with knowing eyes.
