The biting November wind whipped across the desolate stretch of Interstate 40, stinging Elias Thorne’s cheeks raw.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of grit and gravel, danced across the cracked asphalt, momentarily obscuring the already limited visibility.  Elias, bundled in layers of worn denim and a faded orange safety vest, squinted against the sun, which fought a losing battle against the encroaching gloom. His breath plumed out in ragged white clouds, instantly vanishing into the frigid air.  He hunched deeper into his worn parka, the scent of diesel fumes and hot tar clinging to his clothes like a second skin.  The rhythmic drone of the distant traffic, a relentless, mechanical heartbeat, was the only other sound besides the mournful howl of the wind whistling through the skeletal remains of a long-dead cottonwood tree. This lonely expanse of New Mexico highway, miles from the nearest town, was Elias’s office, his kingdom, and his prison all rolled into one.
