The rusted pickup truck, affectionately nicknamed "The Plunger," coughed and sputtered, finally giving up the ghost halfway up Breaker's Hill.  Agnes Periwinkle, her full name a constant source of amusement for less-than-imaginative clients, slammed her fist on the steering wheel.  "Not now, you infernal contraption!" she yelled, the sound swallowed by the desolate landscape around her.  Breaker's Hill was less a hill and more a sprawling, rocky incline that dominated the outskirts of Dustbowl, Arizona.  The town, aptly named, was a collection of sun-baked adobe buildings and dusty storefronts clinging stubbornly to the edge of the unforgiving desert. The air shimmered with the midday heat, and the only sound besides Agnes's frustrated grumbling was the mournful cry of a circling vulture, likely anticipating the demise of either the truck or its owner.  This was Agnes's usual Monday morning welcome, and frankly, it was starting to get old.
