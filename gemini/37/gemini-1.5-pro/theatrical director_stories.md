The biting November wind whipped around Vivienne Holloway, plastering stray strands of her fiery red hair across her chapped lips.  She tugged her worn, charcoal grey scarf tighter, its frayed edges a testament to countless anxious nights spent pacing outside rehearsal spaces.  Above her, the faded grandeur of the Majestic Theatre loomed, a gothic behemoth hunched against the slate-grey Manchester sky.  Gargoyles, their features eroded by decades of industrial grime, seemed to leer down at her, mocking the audacious dream she carried within her: to breathe life back into this forgotten temple of drama, starting with a radical reimagining of Shakespeare's "The Tempest." The theatre, once the jewel of the city's cultural scene, now echoed with the ghostly whispers of forgotten applause and the disconcerting rustle of decaying velvet. Its ornate plasterwork peeled like sunburnt skin, and the once-vibrant murals depicting scenes from classical plays were now faded phantoms, barely discernible in the gloom.  Inside, dust motes danced in the shafts of weak winter sunlight that filtered through the grimy, arched windows, illuminating the vast, empty auditorium.  Vivienne pushed open the heavy oak doors, the sound echoing through the cavernous space like a mournful sigh. This was her stage now. Her battleground.  And she was ready for war.
