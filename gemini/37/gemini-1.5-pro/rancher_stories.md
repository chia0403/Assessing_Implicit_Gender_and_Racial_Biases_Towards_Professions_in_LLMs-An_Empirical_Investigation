The wind, sharp and smelling of impending snow, whipped across the Montana plains, biting at Amelia Grace Holloway’s chapped lips.

This evening, however, the beauty held an edge of unease. The cattle were restless, lowing nervously in the distance, and the usually playful barks of her border collie, Blue, were replaced by a low, persistent growl.  Something wasn’t right.
