The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth as she navigated the cobbled streets of Oakhaven, a small, picture-perfect town nestled in the heart of the Cotswolds.  Honey-colored stone cottages, their windows glowing warmly against the encroaching dusk, lined the narrow lanes, interspersed with the occasional brightly lit shop.  The air smelled of woodsmoke and damp earth, a comforting aroma that usually soothed Eleanor.  Tonight, however, a knot of unease tightened in her stomach.  She clutched her satchel closer, its leather stiff against her gloved hand, and quickened her pace towards the imposing silhouette of Oakhaven Manor, looming against the darkening sky.  It wasn't just the chill wind that made her shiver.  She had a feeling this particular house call was going to be anything but routine.
