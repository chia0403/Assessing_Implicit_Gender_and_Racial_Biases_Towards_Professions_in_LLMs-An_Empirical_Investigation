The pre-dawn chill clung to Amelia Reyes as she hurried across the deserted parking lot of St. Jude's Community Hospital.  Frost glittered on the windshields of the few cars already parked, reflecting the anemic glow of the security lights.  November in upstate New York had a way of sinking its teeth into everything, leeching the color from the world and leaving behind a palette of greys and icy blues. Amelia tugged her burgundy scrub jacket tighter, the embroidered "Phlebotomy" stitched above her name badge a stark white against the fabric.  The automatic doors whooshed open, offering a fleeting sanctuary of warmth and the faint antiseptic scent that had become Amelia's second perfume. Inside, the hushed expectancy of a hospital before the daily rush hung heavy in the air.  Only the rhythmic hum of the vending machines and the distant clatter of a cleaning cart broke the silence. This was Amelia's domain, the quiet before the storm of blood draws and anxious patients.  This was where she found her peace, in the predictable rhythm of preparing needles and vials, steeling herself for the day ahead.
