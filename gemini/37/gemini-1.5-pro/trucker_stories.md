The Nevada sun beat down on the cab of the Peterbilt 389, baking the steering wheel until it felt like a branding iron.  Dust devils danced across the cracked asphalt of Highway 50, the so-called “Loneliest Road in America,” living up to its name this scorching July afternoon.  Inside, Delilah “Dee” Montgomery squinted, her hazel eyes tracing the shimmering mirage of a distant lake that never seemed to get any closer.  Country music twanged low from the speakers, a mournful ballad about lost love and rambling ways, a soundtrack fitting for the desolate landscape stretching out before her. Dee, her brown hair pulled back in a tight braid to escape the oppressive heat, adjusted the brim of her worn baseball cap and reached for the thermos of lukewarm coffee beside her.  This stretch of Nevada was a crucible, a test of endurance for both machine and driver, and Dee, five days into her cross-country haul, was starting to feel the burn.  The delivery to Reno couldn’t come soon enough.
