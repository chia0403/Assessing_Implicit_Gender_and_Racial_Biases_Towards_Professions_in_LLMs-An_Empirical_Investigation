The crisp October air, scented with woodsmoke and decaying leaves, whipped through the open windows of the Mendocino Coast Physical Therapy clinic, ruffling the anatomical charts pinned to Dr. Elias Thorne's corkboard.  Outside, the grey Pacific churned restlessly against the rocky cliffs, a stark contrast to the warm, lamp-lit interior.  Elias, his brow furrowed in concentration, adjusted the goniometer measuring the range of motion in Mrs. Henderson's stiff knee.  The clinic, nestled in a converted Victorian cottage overlooking the small town of Mendocino, California, was usually a haven of calm, the only sounds the gentle creak of the old floorboards and Elias's encouraging murmurs.  But today, a palpable tension hung in the air, a disquiet that mirrored the turbulent sea outside.  Mrs. Henderson, normally a chatterbox, was unusually silent, her gaze fixed on the swirling mist that obscured the headlands.  Something was different.  Something was wrong.
