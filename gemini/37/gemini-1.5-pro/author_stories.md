The salt spray kissed Amelia Zephyr Blackwoodâ€™s face as she leaned against the weathered railing of her balcony, the rusty squeak a familiar counterpoint to the rhythmic crash of waves below. Her Cliffside Cottage, perched precariously on the edge of the Cornish coast near the tiny village of Polridmouth, was a haven, a sanctuary, and, most importantly, her writing retreat.  Grey, swirling mists clung to the craggy cliffs, obscuring the churning Atlantic below and giving the impression that the cottage, with its peeling blue paint and overgrown garden, was floating on a sea of clouds. Inside, a half-finished manuscript lay open on her antique writing desk, the words blurring in the fading afternoon light.  A steaming mug of Earl Grey sat beside it, forgotten, its surface rippled by the persistent wind that howled through the gaps in the window frames. Amelia, bundled in a thick, cable-knit sweater, was lost in thought, her gaze fixed on the distant horizon where the grey sky met the even greyer sea.  She was wrestling with the ending of her latest novel, a gothic mystery set in the very landscape that unfolded before her, and the words, like the elusive Cornish mists, refused to settle.
