The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne as he locked up his practice, Thorne Family Dentistry, the frosted glass of the door rattling in its frame.  Tiny snowflakes, the first of the season in Harmony Creek, Ohio, danced in the streetlights' hazy glow, promising a picturesque, albeit frigid, start to the holiday season.  Harmony Creek, nestled deep in the Appalachian foothills, was a town where everyone knew everyone, and Elias, with his warm smile and gentle hands, was a beloved fixture.  His practice, a converted Victorian house with a wraparound porch and chipped paint the color of robin's eggs, had been in his family for three generations, a testament to their commitment to the town and its people.  Tonight, however, the usual warmth Elias felt for Harmony Creek was tinged with a growing unease. The silence, broken only by the rustling of dry leaves in the gutters, felt heavy, expectant.  Something was different. Something felt wrong.
