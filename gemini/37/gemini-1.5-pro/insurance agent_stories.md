Rain lashed against the window of Amelia "Amy" Grace Hawthorne's cramped office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  The peeling wallpaper, a nauseating shade of institutional beige, seemed to absorb the gloom of the late November afternoon. Located above O’Malley’s Pub in the sleepy, forgotten town of Hollow Creek, Oregon, the office offered a panoramic view of the town square's decay – the chipped paint on the gazebo, the boarded-up windows of the former bakery, and the eternally flickering streetlight that cast long, skeletal shadows. Amy, a State Farm agent by trade and a reluctant resident of Hollow Creek by circumstance, tapped a chipped crimson nail against her desk, a stack of unpaid premium notices threatening to topple over.  The smell of stale beer wafted up from the pub below, a pungent reminder that, for most of Hollow Creek, life’s worries were drowned, not solved.  Today, however, even the allure of a cold pint couldn’t quell the unease that gnawed at Amy.  She had a bad feeling, the kind that settled deep in your bones and whispered of trouble brewing on the horizon.  And in Hollow Creek, trouble usually arrived with a bang.
