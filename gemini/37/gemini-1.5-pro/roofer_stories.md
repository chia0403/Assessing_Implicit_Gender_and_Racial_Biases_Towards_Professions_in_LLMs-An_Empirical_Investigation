The rust-colored dust of Santa Fe clung to everything, even the eyelashes of Elias “Eli” Sanchez. He squinted against the rising New Mexico sun, its rays already baking the terracotta rooftops that stretched out below him like a rumpled blanket.  Eli, perched precariously on the Casa Alegre's steeply pitched roof, adjusted his harness and wiped a bead of sweat from his brow with the back of his calloused hand. The air, still crisp with the lingering chill of a desert night, promised a scorcher.  The rhythmic clang of his hammer against the worn clay tiles was the only sound for miles, save for the occasional distant yelp of a coyote still mourning the lost darkness.  Casa Alegre, a sprawling adobe hacienda built generations ago, was his current project – a re-roofing job complicated by the uneven settling of the old structure and the territorial birds who seemed determined to nest in every nook and cranny.  Eli wasn't afraid of heights, not after years spent walking the rooftops of Santa Fe, but this house, this particular house, had an unnerving stillness about it, a hushed expectancy that prickled the hairs on his neck.
