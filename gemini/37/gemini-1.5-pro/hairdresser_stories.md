The flickering neon sign of "Shear Perfection" cast a lurid, purple glow across the rain-slicked asphalt of Sycamore Street.  Inside, amidst the chemical tang of perms and the hum of hairdryers, Beatrice “Bea” Florence Clementine Dubois sighed, wiping a stray curl from her forehead with the back of her wrist.  It was a Tuesday night in October, the kind of night that clung to the small town of Harmony Springs like damp wool. The only other person in the salon was Mrs. Henderson, her head encased in a swirling cloud of blueish smoke as Bea painstakingly rinsed out a particularly stubborn perm.  Rain lashed against the large front window, blurring the already fading light and reflecting the multi-coloured bottles lining the mirrored walls like a kaleidoscope of half-forgotten dreams.  Bea glanced at the clock – 7:52 pm.  Seven minutes until closing, and then she could finally escape the oppressive humidity and the relentless gossip of Harmony Springs for the sanctuary of her small apartment above the bakery.
