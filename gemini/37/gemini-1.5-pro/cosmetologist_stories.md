The flickering neon sign of "Shear Radiance Salon" cast a lavender glow across the rain-slicked streets of Zenith, Pennsylvania. Inside, amidst the hum of hair dryers and the scent of coconut shampoo,  Seraphina "Sera" Dubois wiped down her station, her reflection staring back at her from the spotless chrome.  Zenith wasn't exactly a bustling metropolis – more like a sleepy town clinging to the banks of the Susquehanna River – but for Sera, it was home.  It was where she'd built her reputation, one perfectly sculpted eyebrow and flawlessly blended balayage at a time.  Tonight, however, the usual Friday night buzz was absent. The only other person in the salon was Mrs. Henderson, perched beneath a dryer, her weekly perm processing. The silence was unnerving, broken only by the rhythmic whir of the dryer and the tapping of Sera’s acrylic nails on the counter.  She glanced at the clock – 10:57 PM. Three minutes until closing, and then she could finally go home and crawl into bed with a good book and a cup of chamomile tea.  But something told Sera this night wasn't going to end as quietly as she'd planned.
