The biting November wind whipped Amelia Reyes's dark hair across her face as she hurried across the cobblestone courtyard of St. Jude's Memorial Hospital.  Gargoyles perched on the gothic building leered down at her, their granite faces slick with rain.  Built in 1888, the hospital clung to the edge of the Hudson River in upstate New York, a brooding presence overlooking the small town of Havenwood. Amelia pulled her fleece tighter, the damp chill seeping into her bones despite the layers. The fluorescent lights of the Emergency Room entrance beckoned, promising a temporary reprieve from the weather, but also heralding the beginning of another long shift. Inside, the controlled chaos awaited: the rhythmic beeping of monitors, the hurried whispers of nurses, and the low hum of anxiety that permeated the air like a sterile, medicinal scent. Tonight, like every night, Havenwood would entrust its aches, pains, and emergencies to Amelia and the team at St. Jude's.  And tonight, like no other night, something truly extraordinary was about to happen.
