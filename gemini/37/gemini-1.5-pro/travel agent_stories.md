The chipped turquoise paint of Amelia "Amy" Reyes's desk mirrored the Caribbean brochures stacked haphazardly upon it.  Her tiny travel agency, "Wanderlove," was tucked between a laundromat and a perpetually closed fortune teller's shop on Bleecker Street in New York City. The February air outside howled a bitter tune, rattling the frosted glass of the shop window, but inside, a faint coconut scent lingered from Amy's morning coffee.  She’d plastered the walls with vibrant posters of far-flung destinations – the sun-drenched beaches of Bali, the snow-capped peaks of Patagonia, the bustling markets of Marrakech – a desperate attempt to inject some warmth and color into the gray reality of a New York winter.  This morning, however, even the vibrant hues seemed muted, mirroring the unease churning in Amy’s stomach.  The rent was due, bookings were slow, and her dream of inspiring wanderlust in others felt more like a slow, agonizing descent into debt.
