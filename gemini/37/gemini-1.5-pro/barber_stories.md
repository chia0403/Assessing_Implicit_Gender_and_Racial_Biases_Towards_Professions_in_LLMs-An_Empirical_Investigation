The flickering neon sign of "Finnian O'Malley's Tonsorial Parlour" cast a lurid, electric green glow across the rain-slicked cobblestones of Grimshaw Alley.  It was a narrow, forgotten lane tucked between the opulent storefronts of High Street and the shadowy, crumbling warehouses down by the docks of Port Blossom.  Inside, amidst the scent of bay rum and talcum powder, Finnian O'Malley himself, a man whose neatly trimmed mustache rivaled the precision of his straight razor, surveyed his empty shop.  The relentless downpour, a fixture of Port Blossom autumns, had kept even the most desperate of the city's unkempt citizenry indoors.  A lone gas lamp hissed above Finnian's worn leather barber chair, illuminating the dust motes dancing in the otherwise gloomy space.  A grandfather clock in the corner ticked with a measured solemnity, each chime a stark reminder of the slow passage of time in a city that never seemed to sleep, yet somehow, in Grimshaw Alley, had forgotten to wake.
