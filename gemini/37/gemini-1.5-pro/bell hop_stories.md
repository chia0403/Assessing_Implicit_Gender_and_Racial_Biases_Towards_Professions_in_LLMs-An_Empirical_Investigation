The opulent lobby of the Grand Blackwood Hotel hummed with a low, luxurious thrum. Sunlight, filtered through the stained-glass depiction of a majestic, antlered stag, painted the marble floor in kaleidoscopic hues.  Dust motes danced in the beams, oblivious to the hushed conversations and the click of heels on the polished surface.  Fitzwilliam "Fitz" Archibald Finch, resplendent in his burgundy uniform with its gleaming brass buttons, adjusted his pillbox hat and surveyed the scene with practiced ease.  It was a Tuesday afternoon in late October, the air outside crisp with the promise of winter, but inside, the Grand Blackwood remained a bastion of perpetual spring, its temperature carefully regulated, its atmosphere thick with the scent of lilies and old money. Fitz anticipated a quiet shift; the usual pre-holiday rush hadn't yet begun, and the hotel was populated mainly by its long-term residents, eccentric millionaires who treated the Blackwood as their own private kingdom.  Little did he know, a single misplaced suitcase was about to shatter the tranquility and plunge him into a mystery more tangled than the ivy creeping up the hotel's venerable facade.
