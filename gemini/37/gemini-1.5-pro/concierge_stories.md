The emerald green awning of the Hotel Magnifique, stitched with gold thread depicting stylized griffins, rippled gently in the warm Parisian breeze. Beneath it,  Isabelle "Izzy" Dubois, her posture as impeccable as the hotel's starched linen, surveyed the bustling Rue de la Paix.  May had arrived in Paris, painting the city in a riot of vibrant blossoms and filling the air with the scent of blooming chestnuts.  Izzy, the Hotel Magnifique’s chief concierge,  adjusted the silk scarf at her neck, a splash of crimson against her crisp navy uniform.  Inside the opulent lobby, the soft murmur of multilingual conversations mingled with the tinkling of a grand piano. It was a typical Tuesday morning – except Izzy had a feeling that today, the ordinary was about to take a decidedly extraordinary turn.
