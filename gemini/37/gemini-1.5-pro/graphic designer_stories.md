The aroma of burnt caramel clung to the air in Eleanor Vance's apartment, a testament to her disastrous attempt at making macarons.  Rain lashed against the oversized window of her converted loft, blurring the already fading neon glow of the Brooklyn skyline.  Scattered across her worn oak worktable were Pantone swatch books, crumpled sketches of fantastical typography, and a half-eaten container of Thai takeout. Eleanor, clad in an oversized paint-splattered sweatshirt and thick-rimmed glasses perched precariously on her nose, stared intensely at her laptop screen.  The cursor blinked mockingly beside a blank canvas in her design software.  It was 3:17 am, the deadline for the rebranding of "Hipster Hound," an artisanal dog treat company, loomed in a mere six hours, and inspiration was stubbornly elusive.  The only sounds in the loft were the rhythmic drumming of the rain, the hum of the refrigerator, and the quiet, frantic tapping of Eleanor's foot against the uneven floorboards.
