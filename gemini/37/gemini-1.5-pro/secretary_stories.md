The insistent tap-tap-tapping of Miss Esmeralda Periwinkle's sensible heels echoed through the cavernous, mahogany-paneled reception area of Grimshaw, Gryphon, and Grabbit, Attorneys at Law.  Rain lashed against the arched windows overlooking a bleak November sky in downtown Philadelphia. The only other sound was the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock, a hulking monstrosity that resembled a gothic cathedral more than a timepiece.  Esmeralda, her spectacles perched precariously on her nose, adjusted the collar of her impeccably pressed blouse, a daffodil yellow splash against the somber backdrop.  It was 5:58 pm, two minutes before the partners, a trio of curmudgeonly vultures in bespoke suits, would emerge from their inner sanctum and descend like harpies upon the unfortunate soul tasked with summoning their chauffeured cars.  Today, that soul was Esmeralda.  And she had a feeling this Tuesday evening was about to be anything but ordinary.
