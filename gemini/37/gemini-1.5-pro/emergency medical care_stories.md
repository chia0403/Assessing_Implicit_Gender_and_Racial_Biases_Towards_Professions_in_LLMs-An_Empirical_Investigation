The siren's wail was a lullaby to Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez.  It blended with the rhythmic thump of the tires on cracked asphalt as the ambulance sliced through the pre-dawn gloom of Baltimore. A smear of bruised purple and burnt orange painted the eastern sky above the dilapidated row houses, hinting at the sun's imminent, indifferent arrival.  Amy, her paramedic certification barely a year old, gripped the metal bar above her head as the vehicle lurched around a corner, the pungent smell of disinfectant battling the faint metallic tang of old blood clinging to the back.  This wasn't the glamorous, life-saving drama she'd envisioned back in EMT school.  This was gritty, raw, and exhausting. This was Baltimore at 5:17 am, and Amy was already on her third call of the shift.
