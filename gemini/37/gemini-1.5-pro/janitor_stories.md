The flickering fluorescent lights of the Zenith Bio-Research atrium buzzed like trapped insects, casting long, skeletal shadows from the giant potted ferns.  Elias Thorne, his name tag slightly askew on his faded Zenith custodial uniform, leaned heavily on his mop, the pungent scent of disinfectant clinging to the air around him like a loyal, if unwelcome, companion. It was 3:17 am, the quietest hour in the sprawling, state-of-the-art facility nestled on the edge of the Silicon Valley sprawl. Outside, a thick fog rolled in from the Pacific, swallowing the already muted glow of distant city lights. Elias, a man whose life revolved around the rhythms of cleaning – the scrape of his squeegee against glass, the whir of the vacuum cleaner, the slosh of dirty mop water –  felt a prickle of unease. It wasn’t the usual pre-dawn loneliness, nor the occasional skittering sound in the ventilation ducts that he'd long ago attributed to overly ambitious rodents. Tonight, the silence was different, heavier, pregnant with an unsettling stillness.
