The neon "Open" sign buzzed erratically, casting a flickering, sickly green glow across the rain-slicked asphalt of Finchley Road.  Inside, Dr. Elias Thorne, D.C., adjusted the knot in his tie, the Windsor feeling a touch too formal for a Wednesday night in a near-deserted clinic.

Eliasâ€™s chiropractic clinic, nestled between a failing laundromat and a perpetually "coming soon" Vietnamese restaurant, usually hummed with the quiet murmur of patients and the gentle clicks of adjusting vertebrae.  Tonight, however, the only sound was the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner, a morbid metronome counting down the minutes to closing time, and hopefully, the end of this unnervingly quiet shift.
