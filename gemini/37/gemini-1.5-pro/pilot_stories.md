The biting Alaskan wind whipped at Amelia “Ace” Reyes’s parka as she wrestled the last tie-down free from the De Havilland Beaver's wing strut.  Glacier-capped peaks, dusted with fresh snow, ringed the frozen Lake Clark, their reflections distorted in the wind-ruffled surface.  The pre-dawn sky was a bruised purple, bleeding into streaks of orange and pink on the eastern horizon, promising a spectacular sunrise… if the weather held.  Ace, her breath clouding in the frigid air, adjusted her fur-lined hood and ran a gloved hand over the worn fuselage of her beloved plane, affectionately nicknamed the “Arctic Fox.”  Denali National Park, vast and unforgiving, stretched out before her, a wilderness she both respected and, in a way, called home.  Today’s flight was a charter to a remote research outpost deep in the park, carrying supplies they desperately needed before winter truly clamped down its icy jaws. The radio crackled in the small hut nearby, a gruff voice confirming the researchers were ready and the airstrip, precarious at the best of times, was clear... for now.
