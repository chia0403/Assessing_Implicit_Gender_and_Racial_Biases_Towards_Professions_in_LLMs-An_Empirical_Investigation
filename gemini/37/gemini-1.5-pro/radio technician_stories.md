The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, stinging Amelia "Amy" Reyes's cheeks as she wrestled a recalcitrant antenna into position.  Rust, the insidious enemy of all things metal on the Isle of Ailsa, had claimed the bolts, turning them into stubborn, orange-brown nubs.  Ailsa itself, a jagged finger of granite jutting out of the steel-grey water twenty miles off the Scottish mainland, was home to little more than the Ailsa Craig Lighthouse, a flock of stubbornly territorial gannets, and Amy herself.  The lighthouse, a stark white tower against the perpetually overcast sky, was her domain, her responsibility. She was not just a lightkeeper; Amelia Reyes was the lighthouse's radio technician, its sole connection to the mainland and the only voice breaking the constant hush of the sea and wind.  This evening, the silence was about to be broken by more than just her usual radio check-in.  The rhythmic pulse of the lighthouseâ€™s beam, usually a comforting metronome, seemed to stutter, and a flicker of unease, colder than the wind, danced across Amy's skin.
