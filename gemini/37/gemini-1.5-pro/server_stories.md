The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Rosie's Diner, a relentless tattoo against the backdrop of crackling vinyl booths and the sizzle of frying onions.  Amelia “Amy” Rose Hawthorne, her nametag pinned slightly askew on her powder-blue uniform, sighed and wiped a damp rag across the already gleaming Formica countertop.  It was 5:17 pm on a Tuesday, and the usual early dinner rush had failed to materialize.  The only other occupant of the diner besides Amy was Mr. Henderson, the octogenarian owner, who sat hunched over a crossword puzzle in the corner booth, his brow furrowed in concentration, a half-eaten slice of apple pie slowly congealing on his plate. Outside, the neon sign depicting a buxom redhead winking at passing cars flickered erratically, its paint peeling like sunburnt skin.  Located on the edge of Highway 16, just outside the sleepy town of Harmony Creek, Arizona, Rosie's was more a haven for weary truckers and local gossips than a culinary destination.  Tonight, however, even the regulars seemed to be avoiding the downpour.  The air hung thick with the smell of coffee and impending boredom.
