The fluorescent lights of "Benny's Best Butchers" hummed a monotonous tune, punctuated by the rhythmic *thwack* of Elias Thorne's cleaver against the aged wooden chopping block.  Outside, the pre-dawn chill of a late November morning clung to the cobblestone streets of Arkham, Massachusetts, painting frosted patterns on the windows of the small shop. The only other sound was the occasional rattle of the delivery truck idling outside, its headlights cutting twin swaths through the swirling mist that clung to the gas lamps lining the street. Elias, a man built like an oak barrel with hands the size of dinner plates, worked with a focused intensity, his thick, salt-and-pepper beard catching stray flecks of crimson. The air hung heavy with the metallic tang of blood and the rich, gamey scent of freshly butchered venison.  Something about this morning felt different, though.  A prickle of unease danced on the back of Elias's neck, a feeling he usually only got right before a storm...or a visit from Old Man Hemlock down the street, who always seemed to know when Elias had a fresh batch of blood sausage.
