The biting November wind rattled the leaded panes of Ashworth Manor, a sound Eliza Mae Higgins had grown accustomed to over the past fifteen years.  A fine layer of frost dusted the sprawling Yorkshire moors visible from the kitchen window, turning the heather a spectral silver.  Inside, however, a comforting warmth emanated from the Aga, its cast-iron bulk humming a low, contented song.  Eliza, her hands red from plunging into icy water to scrub the breakfast dishes, glanced at the grandfather clock in the hall.  7:15 am.  Mr. and Mrs. Ashworth were still asleep, dreaming of grouse hunts and charity galas, oblivious to the meticulous dance Eliza performed each morning to bring order to their opulent, if slightly dusty, world.  Today, however, a subtle discord hummed beneath the familiar routine.  A small, intricately carved wooden box sat on the kitchen table, its lid slightly ajar, revealing a glimpse of tarnished silver within.  It hadn't been there yesterday.
