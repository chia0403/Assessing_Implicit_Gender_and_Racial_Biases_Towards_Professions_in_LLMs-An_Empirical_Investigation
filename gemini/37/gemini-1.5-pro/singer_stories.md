The velvet curtain, heavy with the weight of a thousand performances, shivered slightly as a draft snaked its way through the wings of the dilapidated Orpheum Theatre.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Elara Celeste Moreau. Her fingers, long and elegant, traced the worn wood of her grandmother's guitar, a comforting ritual before every performance. The chipped paint on the instrument felt like Braille beneath her fingertips, grounding her in the present even as her heart hammered a frantic rhythm against her ribs. Tonight wasn't just another gig in another dusty town on the forgotten circuit. Tonight, Elara was playing for her future, a future she hoped would finally lead her out of the shadow of her past and onto the sun-drenched stages of Nashville.  The air in the Orpheum, thick with the scent of stale popcorn and damp wool, crackled with a nervous energy, a tangible buzz that Elara both craved and feared.  This was her last chance, her final audition.
