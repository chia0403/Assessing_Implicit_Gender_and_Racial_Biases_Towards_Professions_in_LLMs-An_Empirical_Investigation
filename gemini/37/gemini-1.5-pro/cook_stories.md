The air in the kitchen of the Wandering Wok was thick with the aroma of ginger and garlic, punctuated by the rhythmic sizzle of onions hitting hot oil.  Outside, the neon glow of Hong Kong's Temple Street Night Market spilled through the open doorway, casting flickering shadows across Mei Lin's focused face.  She, Mei Lin "Mel" Chan, deftly maneuvered between steaming woks and bubbling stockpots, her worn cleaver a blur of controlled motion as she julienned carrots faster than most people could blink. Mel, barely five feet tall but with the strength of ten men in her wiry frame, ran the Wandering Wok, a tiny food stall crammed between a fortune teller and a vendor selling pirated DVDs.  It wasn't much, but it was hers, a legacy from her grandmother, and the heart of her world.  Tonight, however, felt different.  A cool, unsettling breeze snaked through the normally stifling night air, and the shadows dancing on the walls seemedâ€¦longer than usual.
