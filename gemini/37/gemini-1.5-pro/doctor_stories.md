The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne as he hurried across the cobbled courtyard of St. Jude's Hospital, the hem of his long coat flapping against his legs.  Gaslights flickered in the wrought-iron lamps, casting long, dancing shadows that stretched and distorted the gothic architecture of the ancient London building.  A thin layer of frost clung to the gargoyles perched atop the chapel, their stony faces seemingly grimacing down at him.  The year was 1888, and a peculiar unease hung in the fog-choked air, heavier than the usual gloom that clung to the city.  It wasn't just the chill that seeped into Elias's bones; it was a premonition, a creeping dread that something wicked was stirring in the shadows. He paused at the heavy oak door of the hospital, the faint scent of antiseptic and ether briefly masking the metallic tang of blood that clung to the air.  Tonight, Elias knew, would be a long one.
