The bell above the door to Magnolia Pharmacy jingled a melancholic two-note tune as the last customer of the day exited, leaving Dr. Elias Thorne alone amongst the softly glowing shelves of remedies and the hushed whispers of rustling pill bottles. Rain lashed against the large, bay window, mirroring the tempest brewing within Elias. Magnolia Pharmacy, nestled on the corner of Oak Street and Wisteria Lane in the sleepy, perpetually overcast town of Havenwood, Oregon, had been his sanctuary for the past ten years. He knew the creak of the floorboards as intimately as the chemical compounds lining his shelves, the scent of lavender hand soap mingling with the faintly medicinal air as familiar as his own reflection in the antique dispensing mirror. But tonight, the familiar comfort felt more like a suffocating blanket. The rain seemed to seep into the very bones of the old building, echoing the chilling premonition settling in Eliasâ€™s chest.  Something was about to change in Havenwood, and he suspected, with growing unease, it would start right here, within the quiet walls of his pharmacy.
