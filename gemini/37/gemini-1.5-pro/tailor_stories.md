The smell of woodsmoke and damp wool hung heavy in the air, clinging to the cobbled streets of Hollow Creek like a persistent cough.  Rain hammered against the slanted roof of Elias Thorne's tailor shop, a rhythmic drumming that usually soothed him, but tonight, it felt like an insistent tapping on his already frayed nerves.  The shop, nestled between a bustling bakery and a perpetually darkened apothecary, was small but overflowing.  Bolts of fabric in every imaginable colour and texture spilled from shelves, draped over chairs, and even peeked out from beneath the worn, wooden counter.  Elias, his spectacles perched precariously on his nose, hunched over a half-finished waistcoat, the flickering gaslight casting long, dancing shadows across his wrinkled face.  Outside, the wind howled, a mournful sound that seemed to echo the unease gnawing at his heart.
