The scent of almond extract and simmering apricot glaze hung heavy in the air, a sugary fog that clung to Eloise "Ellie" Cartwright's apron and the tips of her chestnut curls.  Her bakery, "Sugar & Bloom," nestled between a dusty antique shop and a perpetually bustling laundromat on Sycamore Street, was a riot of pastel colors.  Buttercream roses, spun-sugar swans, and fondant fancies adorned tiered cakes displayed in the window, each a miniature edible masterpiece.  It was the week before Valentine's Day, which meant Ellie, a whirlwind of creative energy in a flour-dusted denim apron, was in her element â€“ and up to her elbows in buttercream.  Outside, a thin layer of frost clung to the brick buildings and the skeletal branches of the sycamore trees that lined the street, a stark contrast to the warm, sugary haven Ellie had created within.
