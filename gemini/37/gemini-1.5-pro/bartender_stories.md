Rain lashed against the stained-glass peacock perched above The Griffin's Rest, its iridescent feathers shimmering under the intermittent glow of a faulty streetlight. Inside, the pub was a haven of warm, amber light and the low murmur of conversation.  A coal fire crackled in the hearth, fighting back the damp chill that seeped in with every gust of wind.  Behind the long, mahogany bar,  Eleanor "Ellie" Vance polished glasses with a practiced hand, her brow furrowed in concentration. The Griffin’s Rest, nestled in the heart of the perpetually fog-shrouded town of Port Blossom, Maine, was her domain.  Tonight, however, the usual comforting rhythm of clinking glasses and friendly banter was punctuated by an unsettling quiet, a stillness that prickled the back of Ellie's neck.  Something was different.  Something felt…wrong.
