Mia, her navy uniform impeccably crisp despite the long-haul flight from Madrid, navigated the narrow aisle with the practiced grace of a tightrope walker, her trolley rattling softly as she collected discarded headphones and empty water bottles. Lisbon was less than an hour away, the final descent already initiated, but Mia felt the familiar knot of anticipation tightening in her stomach.

She was leaving behind the familiar comfort of the sky for the uncertain terrain of a new life.
