The sun, a malevolent eye in the bleached blue sky, beat down on Elias Vance.  Sweat plastered his orange safety vest to his back, and the asphalt beneath his steel-toed boots shimmered with heat haze.  A hawk circled lazily overhead, its shadow a momentary reprieve from the glare. Elias squinted, wiping the sweat from his brow with the back of a calloused hand. The air vibrated with the low thrum of distant traffic and the closer, more insistent whine of cicadas clinging to the dry grasses along the shoulder of Interstate 40, just outside of Tucumcari, New Mexico.  Mile marker 107, to be exact. Elias knew this stretch of highway like the back of his hand; he'd been patching potholes and clearing debris along this desolate ribbon of road for the last fifteen years. Today, however, felt different. The silence between passing trucks was heavier, the heat more oppressive. A strange, coppery tang hung in the air, and a shiver crawled down Elias's spine, despite the sweltering heat.  Something was wrong.
