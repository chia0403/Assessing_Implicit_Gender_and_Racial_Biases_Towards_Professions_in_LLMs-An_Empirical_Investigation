The only sound apart from the wind was the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner, a steady beat against the unnerving silence of the woods.  Elias, his calloused hands wrapped around a steaming mug of coffee, stared out the grime-streaked window at the swirling mist that obscured the familiar treeline, a sense of foreboding creeping into his heart.
