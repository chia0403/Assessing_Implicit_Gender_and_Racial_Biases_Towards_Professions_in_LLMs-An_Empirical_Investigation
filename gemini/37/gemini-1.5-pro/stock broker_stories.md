Rain lashed against the thirty-foot windows of Elias Thorne's office, blurring the already fading cityscape of Manhattan into a watercolor of greys and flickering golds.  Elias, whose full name was Elias Vance Thorne III, tapped a manicured finger against the cool glass, the rhythmic sound a counterpoint to the relentless drumming of the storm. His tailored suit, a dark charcoal that mirrored the impending night, hung perfectly on his lean frame.  At thirty-two, he exuded an air of controlled power, the kind forged in the crucible of Wall Street’s relentless churn.  His office, perched high above the trading floor of Prescott & Sterling, was a testament to his success: sleek, minimalist, and dominated by a panoramic view that, on clearer evenings, showcased the glittering expanse of the city he’d conquered. But tonight, the only light came from the luminescent Bloomberg terminals that glowed like ethereal portals, displaying the turbulent currents of the global market, a market poised on the precipice of something big, something Elias couldn’t quite decipher.  The air crackled with an almost palpable tension, a premonition of the storm brewing not just outside his window, but within the very heart of the financial world.
