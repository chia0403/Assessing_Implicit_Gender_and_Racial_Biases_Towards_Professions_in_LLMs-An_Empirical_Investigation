The biting November wind whipped across the manicured lawns of Athelney Manor, tugging at the brim of Elias Thorne's tweed cap.  Elias, his full name Elias Henry Thorne, adjusted the cap with a calloused hand, his breath puffing out in small white clouds. Frost crunched beneath his worn leather boots as he surveyed the grounds.  Athelney, a sprawling Victorian estate nestled in the heart of the Somerset countryside, was his domain.  Twenty acres of perfectly pruned hedges, rose gardens bursting with late-blooming defiance, and ancient oak trees that stood sentinel against the grey sky â€“ all under his watchful eye.  This morning, however, a disquiet hung heavier than the frost.  A single, crimson glove lay abandoned on the dew-kissed grass near the sundial, a stark splash of color in the muted landscape.  It wasn't the gardener's. It wasn't his. And Elias knew, with a certainty that settled deep in his bones, that something at Athelney was amiss.
