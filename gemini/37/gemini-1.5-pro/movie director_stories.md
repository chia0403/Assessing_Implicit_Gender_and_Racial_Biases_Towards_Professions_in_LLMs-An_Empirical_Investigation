The biting February wind whipped at Cassandra "Cassie" Moreau’s black beret, threatening to tear it from her head and send it spiralling across the frozen expanse of Lake Michigan.  She gripped it tighter, her gloved fingers numb despite the cashmere lining.  Chicago, usually a concrete and steel labyrinth buzzing with life, was hushed beneath a thick blanket of snow.  The only sound apart from the wind was the rhythmic crunch of Cassie’s boots on the packed snow as she walked the deserted shoreline near North Avenue Beach.  A half-finished screenplay, its pages curling inwards against the cold, weighed heavily in her messenger bag.  "The Serpent and the Dove," a noir thriller set in post-war Paris, was Cassie's passion project, the film she believed would finally break her out of the indie darling box and onto Hollywood’s A-list. But the elusive final act, the piece that would tie the intricate plot threads together, continued to elude her, a phantom limb in the narrative body she was painstakingly constructing. The grey sky mirrored her mood, heavy with the threat of more snow and the heavier weight of creative frustration.
