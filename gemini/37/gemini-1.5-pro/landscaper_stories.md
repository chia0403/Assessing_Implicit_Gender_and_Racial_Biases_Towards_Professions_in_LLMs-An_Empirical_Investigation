The biting October wind whipped at Elias Thorne's cheeks, turning them the same shade as the crimson maple leaves skittering across Mrs. Henderson's meticulously manicured lawn.  He tugged his worn beanie further down over his ears, the knit scratching against his stubble.  Frost crunched beneath his boots as he surveyed the scene: the rolling hills of the Hudson Valley dipped and swooped, each crest crowned with a vibrant explosion of autumn color.  Elias loved this time of year, even with the impending winter whispering threats of bare branches and frozen ground.  It was the quiet beauty of it all, the stark contrast of the fiery foliage against the steely grey sky, the sense of nature bracing itself, drawing inwards before the long sleep.  Here, nestled amongst the estates of Sleepy Hollow, where the air hung thick with history and the whispers of legend, Elias found solace in the rhythm of the seasons, in the honest work of his hands. Mrs. Henderson’s property, “Wysteria Cottage,” was his current canvas, and he intended to paint it a masterpiece of autumnal splendor.
