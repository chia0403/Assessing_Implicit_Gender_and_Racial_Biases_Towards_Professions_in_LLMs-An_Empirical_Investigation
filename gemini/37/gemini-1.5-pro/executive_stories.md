Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Amelia Grace Hawthorne's 48th-floor office, blurring the already fading twilight cityscape of Hong Kong.  The rhythmic drumming of water against glass mirrored the relentless throb of a headache building behind her temples. Amelia, Chief Operations Officer of  Aether Industries, a global tech conglomerate, pushed aside the untouched plate of delicate sushi from the high-powered business dinner she'd just hosted.  Her sleek, minimalist office, usually a sanctuary of cool greys and polished chrome, felt oppressive tonight.  The air hung thick with the lingering scent of jasmine tea and unspoken tension.  A single email, glowing starkly on her obsidian desktop, pulsed with the same ominous rhythm as the rain and her headache. Subject: Project Chimera - Security Breach.
