The flickering gaslight cast elongated shadows across Amelia Hawthorne's ledger, the figures dancing like tiny, malevolent imps as she meticulously recorded each penny earned and spent by the Grimshaw Shipping Company.  It was a damp, chilly evening in November, 1888, and a thick fog, the kind that clung to the cobbled streets of Grimsby like a shroud, muffled the usual cacophony of dockside activity.  Amelia, her spectacles perched precariously on her nose, shivered despite the threadbare shawl draped over her shoulders.  The small, cramped office, tucked away in a forgotten corner of the warehouse, offered little respite from the penetrating chill.  Outside, the mournful cry of a foghorn echoed through the fog, a sound that always seemed to herald some impending unease.  And tonight, Amelia felt it more keenly than ever.
