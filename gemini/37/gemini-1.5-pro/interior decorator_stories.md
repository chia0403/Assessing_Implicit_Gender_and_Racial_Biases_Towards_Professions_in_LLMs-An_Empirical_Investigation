Rain lashed against the arched windows of Henrietta Beaulieu's design studio, blurring the already fading twilight into a melancholy grey.  Her studio, nestled above Madame Dubois' patisserie on Rue Cler in Paris, was usually a vibrant haven of colour swatches and fabric samples.

Henrietta, her auburn hair pulled back in a loose bun, paced restlessly, the click of her heeled boots a staccato rhythm against the backdrop of the downpour.  A half-finished sketch of a lavish Art Deco-inspired salon lay abandoned on her drafting table, overshadowed by a crumpled telegram that had arrived just an hour earlier, its contents threatening to unravel the meticulously crafted world she had built around herself.  The telegram summoned her back to Château Bellefleur, her childhood home in the Loire Valley – a place she hadn't seen, and desperately tried to forget, in over fifteen years.
