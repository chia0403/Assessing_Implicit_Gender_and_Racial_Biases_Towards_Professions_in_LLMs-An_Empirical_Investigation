The salt spray kissed Elara Thistlewick's face as she perched precariously on the jagged cliffs of Port Blossom, her easel braced against the relentless wind. Below, the quaint Cornish fishing village clung to the rocky coastline like a barnacle to a ship's hull.  Cottages painted in shades of faded pastel huddled together, their chimney smoke swirling skyward in whimsical patterns.  The air vibrated with the cries of gulls and the rhythmic crash of waves against the shore, a soundtrack Elara had come to cherish.  This was her haven, her escape, the place where the vibrant chaos within her found form and colour on the canvas. Today, however, the usual inspiration eluded her.  Her palette, normally a riot of hues, remained untouched. A blank canvas stared back at her, reflecting the unsettling emptiness she felt within.
