The salt spray kissed Amelia Iris Thorne’s face as she perched precariously on the cliff edge, her easel wobbling in the gusty Cornish wind.  Below her, the churning Atlantic gnawed at the granite teeth of the coastline, its turquoise waters frothing white against the dark rocks. The sky, a bruised canvas of purples and greys, threatened rain, but Amelia was undeterred. This tempestuous landscape, this wild, untamed beauty of Portcurno, was the reason she’d uprooted her London life and sought refuge in a crumbling cottage overlooking the sea. It was here, surrounded by the elemental forces of nature, that Amelia hoped to rediscover the passion that had once burned so brightly within her, a passion that had, of late, dwindled to a flickering ember. The scent of brine and seaweed filled the air, mingling with the faint, metallic tang of the oil paints squeezed onto her palette.  Her fingers, stained with cerulean and viridian, tightened around her brush.  Today, she would attempt to capture the untamable spirit of the sea. Today, she would try to paint the storm.
