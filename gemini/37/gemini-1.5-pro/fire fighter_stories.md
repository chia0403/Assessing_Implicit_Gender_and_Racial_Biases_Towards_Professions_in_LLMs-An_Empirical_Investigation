Sirens wailed in the distance, a mournful counterpoint to the crackling inferno.  Below, on the frozen street, a crowd had gathered, their breath clouding the air in ghostly plumes.  Mia could hear their worried murmurs, a low hum that underscored the urgency of her task.  The old orphanage, a looming gothic structure perched atop Widow's Hill overlooking the sleepy town of Havenwood, was more than just a building; it was a landmark, a sanctuary, a repository of generations of memories – and tonight, it was a tinderbox.
