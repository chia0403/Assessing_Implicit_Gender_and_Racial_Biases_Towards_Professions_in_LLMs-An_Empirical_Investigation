## Story Opening:

The stage was a graveyard of discarded dreams. Scraps of velvet hung like tattered flags from rotting scenery, and the air, thick with dust and the ghosts of performances past, clung to Edward Alistair Finch like a shroud. He ran a hand, calloused and ink-stained, over the chipped plaster of a Grecian column lying prone like a fallen god. A sigh, heavy with frustration and the persistent ache in his lower back, escaped him.

“Damn them, damn them all!” he muttered, the words swallowed by the cavernous silence of the abandoned Majestic Theatre. He’d poured his heart and soul – his meagre savings, his already tarnished reputation – into this production, this bold, revolutionary reimagining of "Hamlet" that would, he’d firmly believed, reignite his career and prove all the naysayers wrong. Instead, it had been cancelled, yanked unceremoniously from the schedule two weeks before opening night, leaving him with nothing but a mountain of debt and the bitter taste of failure.

## Setting:

**The Abandoned Majestic Theatre, Detroit, Michigan, 1962.**

Once a glittering beacon of the city’s vibrant theatrical scene, the Majestic now stood as a testament to faded glory. The velvet seats were ripped and stained, the once-ornate ceiling crumbled in places, and the grand chandelier, its crystal prisms missing, hung precariously like a forgotten tear. Dust motes danced in the shafts of sunlight that pierced through the boarded-up windows, illuminating the skeletal remains of Edward's ill-fated "Hamlet" production. Outside, the roar of Detroit's booming automotive industry was a constant reminder of a world moving on, leaving the Majestic, and Edward Alistair Finch, firmly in the past. The building itself held a palpable weight, a sense of longing for the applause that no longer echoed within its walls. It was a place of whispers and shadows, of forgotten promises and the lingering scent of dreams gone sour.
