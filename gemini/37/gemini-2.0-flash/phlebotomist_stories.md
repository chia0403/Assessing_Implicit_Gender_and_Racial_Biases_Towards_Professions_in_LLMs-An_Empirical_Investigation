**Opening:**

The sterile scent of antiseptic stung Amelia Bellweather’s nostrils, a familiar comfort in the chaos of the Monday morning blood draw rush. She deftly tied off Mrs. Henderson’s arm, the familiar purple tourniquet tightening around a limb riddled with years of unseen battles. Mrs. Henderson, bless her heart, always complained about the sting, but Amelia knew just the spot, that sweet vein near the elbow that practically begged to be poked.

“Just a little pinch, Mrs. Henderson,” Amelia said, her voice a soothing balm against the woman’s anxiety. “Think of it as a tiny vampire kiss, but for health purposes.”

Mrs. Henderson chuckled, a dry, papery sound, and Amelia smiled. A little humor was the best medicine, sometimes even better than the bloodwork they were about to perform. But as the crimson tide began to fill the first vacutainer, Amelia’s practiced movements faltered. A persistent shiver crawled down her spine, a prickling unease that had nothing to do with the overly air-conditioned lab and everything to do with the uneasy feeling that she was being watched.

**Setting:**

The scene takes place inside the "Good Samaritan Regional Blood Draw Lab" in Oakhaven, a small, unassuming town nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains in West Virginia. The lab itself is a functional, if slightly dated, space. The walls are painted a pale, institutional green, and the linoleum floor, though meticulously cleaned, bears the scars of countless footsteps. Four blood draw stations line one wall, each separated by a thin, beige curtain offering a modicum of privacy. The back wall houses a humming centrifuge and a phalanx of refrigerators filled with vials of collected blood, neatly labeled and awaiting transport to the main hospital in Charleston. A small waiting area at the front is furnished with mismatched chairs and a stack of outdated magazines. A single, wilting philodendron sits precariously on the reception desk, a testament to someone's half-hearted attempt to bring life to the sterile environment. Outside, the gray sky promises a downpour, casting long, dramatic shadows across the landscape.
