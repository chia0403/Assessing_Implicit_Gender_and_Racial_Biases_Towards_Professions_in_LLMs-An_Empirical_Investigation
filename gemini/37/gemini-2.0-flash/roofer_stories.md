## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The oppressive heat clung to Port Royal, South Carolina, like Spanish moss on a live oak. It was late August, the air thick and heavy with the smell of pluff mud and salt, a familiar scent that usually soothed a Lowcountry soul, but today only added to the simmering discomfort. The houses, a colorful patchwork of pastel blues, yellows, and pinks, stood baking under the relentless sun, their shutters drawn tight in a futile attempt to ward off the heat. Even the seagulls seemed to be struggling, their usual boisterous squawks reduced to listless whimpers as they perched precariously on rusted dock pilings.

**Story Opening:**

Sweat dripped from Ezekiel "Zeke" Jones's brow, stinging his eyes as he hauled another bundle of asphalt shingles onto the weathered roof of the two-story Victorian on King Street. The shingles, hot enough to fry an egg on, stuck to his gloved hands like tar babies. Zeke paused, leaning against the chimney for a brief respite. He was a man built like an old oak himself â€“ sturdy and weathered, with sun-baked skin and hands calloused from years of grappling with nails, hammers, and the fickle temperament of Lowcountry weather. He pulled a bandanna from his pocket, wiping the grime and sweat from his face, and surveyed the street below. Tourists in brightly colored shirts milled about, oblivious to the backbreaking labor required to keep this historic town looking so picturesque. They probably thought the roofs just magically stayed leak-free. Zeke chuckled, a dry, rasping sound. "They got another thing comin'," he muttered to the humid air. Today's job wasn't just about fixing a leak; it felt like a battle against the relentless march of time and the unforgiving elements. And he knew, deep down, that this roof, and maybe even this town, held secrets older and darker than the weathered bricks beneath his feet.
