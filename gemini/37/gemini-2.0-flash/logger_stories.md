The biting wind, laced with the scent of pine and damp earth, gnawed at Bartholomew “Bart” Oliver’s face as he surveyed the felled timber. The early morning sun, a pale disc struggling to pierce the thick canopy of the Olympic National Forest, cast long, skeletal shadows across the clearing. Bart, all six foot four inches of him, leaned against the gargantuan trunk of a Sitka spruce, his plaid flannel shirt straining at the buttons over his broad chest. Sawdust clung to his beard like a stubborn morning mist.

He’d been logging these woods since he was barely old enough to shave, following in the footsteps of his father and grandfather. Generations of Olivers had wrestled these giants to the ground, providing the lumber that built homes and businesses across the Pacific Northwest. But lately, Bart felt a growing unease, a whisper in the wind that spoke of the changing times and the dwindling forests. This particular section, designated Section 47B, was one of the last untouched groves left in the Oliver Logging Company’s holdings. And Bart, despite his heritage, felt a pang of something akin to guilt every time he heard the thunderous crash of another ancient tree brought down.
