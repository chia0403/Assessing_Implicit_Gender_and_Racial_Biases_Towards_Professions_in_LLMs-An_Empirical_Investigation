**Story Opening:**

The insistent chirping of the antiquated, robin's-egg blue telephone sliced through the thick, pre-dawn silence. Dr. Eleanor Vivian Thorne groaned, burying her head further into the goose-down pillow. Three rings became five, then seven, each one a tiny hammer blow against her skull. She’d been on call all weekend, patching up lumberjacks with chainsaw mishaps and delivering babies who seemed determined to arrive before the first frost. This early morning summons could only mean one thing: more trouble.

Finally, with a sigh that rustled the hand-stitched quilt, Eleanor reached out a hand, fumbling for the receiver in the dim light filtering through the thick, woolen curtains. “Thorne,” she croaked, her voice thick with sleep.

A frantic voice, crackling with static, assaulted her ear. “Dr. Thorne! Thank goodness! It’s… it’s Old Man Hemlock. He ain’t breathing!”

**Setting:**

The story unfolds in the remote, isolated town of Havenwood, nestled deep within the heart of the sprawling Redwood National and State Parks of Northern California. Towering redwoods, ancient and silent, cast long, dappled shadows over everything, giving the town a perpetually twilight feel.

Havenwood itself is a community clinging to the past. Log cabins with wood-burning stoves huddle together on narrow, winding streets, a stark contrast to the sleek, modern world that lies beyond the dense forest. The air is thick with the scent of pine needles, damp earth, and woodsmoke.

Dr. Eleanor Vivian Thorne’s office, a quaint, clapboard building painted a cheerful, though slightly faded, yellow, stands at the edge of town, overlooking the rushing Eel River. Inside, the waiting room is filled with well-worn leather chairs, stacks of outdated magazines, and the comforting aroma of beeswax polish and antiseptic. A vintage anatomical chart hangs on the wall, a silent testament to the timeless nature of the human body, juxtaposed against the untamed wilderness that surrounds them. The year is 1953.
