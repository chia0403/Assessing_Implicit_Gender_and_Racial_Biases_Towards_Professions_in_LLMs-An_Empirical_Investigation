The air in Professor Eleanor Ainsworth's office hung thick with the scent of old paper and dried lavender. Rain lashed against the mullioned windows of Greyhaven University, blurring the gothic spires into hazy grey ghosts. A low groan emanated from the heating system, a mechanical lament mirroring Eleanor's own internal grumbling. She sat hunched over a precarious stack of essays, the lamplight glinting off the silver chain holding her spectacles in place. Each meticulously crafted sentence – or, more often, the lack thereof – was a tiny pinprick to her already fraying patience. Another first-year student mistaking King Lear for a character in a Marvel comic. Another mangled quote from Shakespeare. Another plea for leniency due to "personal circumstances" vaguely alluding to a crippling fear of iambic pentameter. Eleanor rubbed her temples, a familiar tension headache blooming behind her eyes. Tonight, Greyhaven, with its ancient traditions and lofty ideals, felt less like a bastion of intellectual enlightenment and more like a gothic prison, trapping her in an endless cycle of grading and frustrated sighs.
