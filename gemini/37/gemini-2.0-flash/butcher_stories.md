**Opening:**

The smell of sawdust and simmering spices was the first thing Arthur Penhaligon encountered each morning, a comforting, familiar blanket against the biting November air. He hadn't minded the chill much these days, not with the Christmas rush looming. Soon, his small shop, "Penhaligon's Provisions," would be overflowing with frantic shoppers, desperate for the perfect roast beef, the juiciest ham, the plumpest Christmas goose. Arthur inhaled deeply, the aroma a promise of brisk business and tired, but satisfied, evenings. He reached for his well-worn apron, a canvas of faded red stained with the ghosts of a thousand cuts of meat, and tied it tightly around his ample waist.

**Setting:**

Penhaligon's Provisions sat nestled on a cobbled street in the heart of the quaint Cornish fishing village of Port Isaac. The building itself was a two-story affair, the top half whitewashed, its lower half a warm, inviting brick. A painted sign, chipped and faded by salty sea winds, swung gently above the door. Inside, the shop was a cozy haven against the elements. Walls were lined with shelves groaning under the weight of pickled onions, homemade jams, and jars of locally sourced honey. A gleaming, antique butcher's block dominated the center of the room, worn smooth by generations of Penhaligons wielding their cleavers. Strings of dried herbs hung from the low, beamed ceiling, adding to the rustic charm. The scent of brine mingled with the rich aroma of cured meats, creating a unique, and undeniably appetizing, atmosphere. Outside, the rhythmic crash of waves against the harbor walls provided a constant, soothing soundtrack to Arthur's working day.
