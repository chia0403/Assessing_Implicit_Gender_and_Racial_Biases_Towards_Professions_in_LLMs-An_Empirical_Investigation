The smell of damp earth and freshly cut grass clung to Finnigan O'Malley like a second skin. He was a landscaper, born and bred, and to him, that scent was more comforting than any expensive cologne. He squinted at the sprawling lawn before him, emerald green against the backdrop of the imposing Victorian mansion, "Greywood Manor." Finnigan, all five-foot-ten of him, with his perpetually sun-kissed face and perpetually dirt-stained hands, felt a pang of intimidated admiration. Greywood Manor, nestled on the bluffs overlooking the choppy waters of the Puget Sound in Washington state, was a landmark, a monument to old money and even older secrets.

The salty air whipped around him, carrying the distant cries of seagulls and the rhythmic clang of a buoy marker. It was a typical early spring day in the Pacific Northwest â€“ overcast, threatening rain, and hinting at a sun that stubbornly refused to break through. Greywood Manor, with its imposing grey stone facade, pointed turrets, and a tangled web of ivy clinging to its walls, only seemed to absorb the dreary atmosphere, becoming even more gothic and forbidding. Finnigan shifted the weight of his leaf blower onto his shoulder. He had a lot of work to do, a garden to tame, and a feeling in his gut that told him this job was going to be more complicated than simply mowing the lawn.
