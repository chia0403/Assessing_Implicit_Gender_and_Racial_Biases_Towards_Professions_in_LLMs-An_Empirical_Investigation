## Story Opening:

The sterile scent of rubbing alcohol clung to Amelia Grace Harding like a second skin. She inhaled deeply, a habit honed over the past seven years working at the Northwood Family Clinic. It wasn't a pleasant scent, exactly, but it was a familiar one, a comforting constant amidst the daily chaos. Today, however, even the alcohol couldn't mask the lingering aroma of burnt popcorn, a testament to Mrs. Higgins' brief but catastrophic foray into microwave cooking during her pre-appointment jitters.

Amelia sighed, running a hand through her messy braid. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, a monotonous drone that mirrored the steady rhythm of her work. She glanced at the clock; 9:17 AM. Mrs. Patterson, complaining of chronic back pain that somehow always flared up right before she needed to lift something heavy, was five minutes late. Plenty of time to review her chart and brace herself for the familiar onslaught of dramatic sighs and thinly veiled accusations of ageism.

Northwood Family Clinic, nestled in the heart of the sleepy town of Willow Creek, Wisconsin, was a far cry from the bustling city hospitals Amelia had envisioned during her Physician Assistant studies. But after the heartbreak of her engagement falling apart in Chicago, the quiet predictability of Willow Creek had been exactly what she needed. A fresh start, a slower pace, and a community that felt less like a collection of strangers and more like an extended, albeit occasionally eccentric, family.

The buzzer on her door chirped, announcing the arrival of Mrs. Patterson. Amelia straightened her posture, plastered on her most empathetic smile, and prepared for another day in the trenches of small-town medicine. Today, it seemed, would be a day filled with more backaches, burned popcorn, and the enduring hope that she could make just a little bit of difference.
