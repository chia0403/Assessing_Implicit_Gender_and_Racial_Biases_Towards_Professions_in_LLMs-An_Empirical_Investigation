The wind howled a mournful ballad through the skeletal branches of the ancient oak, rattling the frosted windows of the clinic. Inside, Eleanor "Ellie" Ainsworth rubbed her tired eyes and shivered, pulling her worn cardigan tighter around her. The old wood-burning stove in the corner pulsed with a reluctant heat, barely enough to chase away the chill that seemed to emanate from the very stone walls of the building.

Ellie, a veterinarian of thirty-two years, ran Ainsworth Veterinary Clinic in the sleepy, rural town of Havenwood, nestled deep within the Allegheny Mountains of Pennsylvania. Havenwood was the kind of place where everybody knew your business, where gossip traveled faster than the autumn leaves, and where the local hardware store also sold live chickens. Her clinic was a converted Victorian house, complete with creaky floorboards, a perpetually jammed front door, and the lingering scent of antiseptic and, more often than not, cow manure. Tonight, Havenwood was draped in a blanket of early December snow, the flakes swirling and dancing in the feeble glow of the streetlights, making it look like a scene ripped straight from a vintage Christmas card. It should have been a beautiful sight, but Ellie was too preoccupied to appreciate it. The wail of a sick calf echoed in her mind, a stark reminder of the long night ahead.
