The chipped Formica countertop of Amelia Jean Harkness's tiny office pressed cold against her forearm. Rain lashed against the windowpane, mirroring the tempest brewing in the pit of her stomach. It was Monday, the day of the "Great Senior Panic," as she'd morbidly nicknamed it. October meant college application deadlines loomed large, and anxieties, thick and cloying, filled the hallways of Northwood High School like a noxious fog.

Amelia sighed, pushing aside a stack of brightly-colored brochures promising "Ivy League Dreams" and "Guaranteed Success." She wasn't a miracle worker, just a guidance counselor trying to help teenagers navigate the treacherous waters of their burgeoning adulthoods. The rain intensified, a relentless drumbeat that felt oddly accusatory. *Had she done enough? Could she do enough?*

The setting was undeniably bleak. Northwood High, built in the 1960s, was a testament to uninspired architecture and deferred maintenance. Located in the economically depressed town of Harmony Creek, Pennsylvania, the school struggled with underfunding and apathy. The faded murals in the hallways depicted smiling students launching into bright futures, a stark contrast to the reality faced by many of Northwood's graduates. The air always smelled faintly of stale floor wax and desperation, a perfume that clung to Ameliaâ€™s clothes long after she left for the day. Today, with the rain and the impending wave of anxious seniors, the atmosphere felt particularly suffocating. Amelia knew she needed more than just platitudes to offer. She needed a life raft. And she desperately hoped she could find one before the flood hit.
