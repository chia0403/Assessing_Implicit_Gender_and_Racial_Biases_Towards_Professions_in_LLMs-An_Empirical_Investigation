## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, rattling the windows of "The Flour Child," a small, stubbornly cheerful bakery nestled on the cobbled main street of Whitby, England. The bakery, with its cream-painted fa√ßade and flower-filled window boxes bravely defying the November gloom, was a beacon of warmth and sweet aromas. Inside, the air hummed with the quiet clatter of baking trays and the cheerful murmur of local gossip.
