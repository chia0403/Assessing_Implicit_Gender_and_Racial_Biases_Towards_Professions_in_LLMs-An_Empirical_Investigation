## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune, bouncing off the perpetually-sticky laminate countertop. Outside, the March wind howled, a soundtrack to the growing dread bubbling in Mildred Agnes Periwinkle's stomach. She swiveled in her squeaky office chair, the springs protesting with a weary groan that mirrored her own mood. Her reflection, framed by the cheap, smudged glass of the strip mall window, wasn't reassuring. Fine lines, etched by years of deciphering W-2s and navigating the labyrinthine passages of the IRS code, radiated from her tired, intelligent eyes.

It wasn't just the end-of-tax-season exhaustion pressing down on her. No, this was somethingâ€¦ different. A prickling unease, a sense of being watched, that had been growing steadily over the past few weeks. She'd dismissed it initially, attributing it to the caffeine jitters brought on by endless cups of lukewarm gas station coffee. But the feeling persisted, clinging to her like lint on a dark suit.

Today, it was amplified. A stack of folders, each representing a life reduced to numbers and deductions, sat accusingly on her desk. And one file in particular, nestled innocently amidst the others, radiated a strange, almost tangible energy. The name on the label, handwritten in a bold, almost aggressive scrawl, was a name she hadn't seen before, a name that sent a chill skittering down her spine: Vincent "The Vulture" Moretti.

## Setting:

Mildred's office, "Periwinkle's Personal Finances," was located in a low-rent strip mall in the sleepy, blue-collar suburb of Oakhaven, Illinois. Nestled between a perpetually-closed laundromat and a discount vape shop, it was a place where dreams of tax refunds and financial stability went to either flourish or quietly die. The interior was a testament to frugality and a lack of design sense. Beige walls, speckled with years of accumulated dust, were adorned with motivational posters featuring stock photos of smiling families and slogans like "Planning for a Brighter Future!" which now felt particularly ironic. The furniture consisted of mismatched pieces salvaged from garage sales and the local thrift store: a desk that wobbled alarmingly, a chair that squeaked incessantly, and a filing cabinet that required a well-aimed kick to open. The overall ambiance was one of quiet desperation, punctuated by the hum of the fluorescent lights and the distant roar of traffic on the highway.
