## Story Opening and Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The aroma of stale coffee and floor wax hung heavy in the air of Mrs. Eleanor Mae Plumtreeâ€™s third-grade classroom, clinging to the felt of the alphabet banner like a stubborn burr. It was 6:47 AM, a full hour and a half before the chaotic symphony of twenty-seven eight-year-olds would descend upon her domain. Eleanor, however, was already here, hunched over a mountain of misspelled holiday wish lists, a crimson pen practically vibrating in her hand. She sighed, a tiny puff of air that barely disturbed the single strand of unruly grey hair that had escaped her meticulously pinned bun. "Dear Santa, I wnt a ppy..." Eleanor mumbled, circling the offending words with weary resignation. This year, more than any other, she felt like Santa needed a vacation more than she did.

**Setting:**

The story takes place in the small, unassuming town of Harmony Creek, Iowa. The Harmony Creek Elementary School is a single-story brick building, built in the 1950s, that shows its age in the slightly faded paint and the perpetually-stained drinking fountain in the hallway. Eleanor Mae Plumtree's third-grade classroom, room 203, is a bright, albeit cluttered, space. Walls are adorned with colorful student artwork, inspirational posters featuring fuzzy kittens and improbable sunsets, and the aforementioned alphabet banner. A reading nook, complete with beanbag chairs and overflowing bookshelves, occupies one corner. Desks are arranged in neat rows, each bearing a nameplate painstakingly crafted by Eleanor herself. The air usually hums with the energy of young minds, but in the pre-dawn hours, it holds a quiet anticipation, a promise of the day to come, both the joys and the tribulations.
