## Story Opening:

The overhead bin slammed shut with a satisfying click, the hollow echo barely audible over the boarding bustle. Amelia Isabella Rossi, a name too grand for her practical, no-nonsense demeanor, wiped a stray strand of her chestnut hair from her forehead and plastered on her practiced smile. "Welcome aboard, everyone! Find your seats and get comfortable. We'll be taking off shortly."

Amelia hated boarding. It was a symphony of flailing limbs, misplaced bags, and perpetually confused passengers who couldn't seem to grasp the concept of seating assignments. But it was a necessary prelude to the best part of her job: the quiet hum of the engines, the feeling of defying gravity, and the breathtaking view from 30,000 feet.

Today, however, a nervous energy thrummed beneath the surface of her usual professionalism. Today's flight wasn't just another milk run to Denver. Today's flight was different. Today, she had a feeling that something… unexpected… was about to happen.

## Setting:

**Aircraft:** A Boeing 737-800, operated by Horizon Vista Airlines. The interior is relatively modern, with comfortable (though slightly worn) cloth seats in a deep navy blue, offset by light grey headrests. The overhead bins are a clean, metallic silver, and the cabin lighting is a soothing, adjustable LED.

**Location:** Denver International Airport (DIA), Gate B47. The airport is bustling with the usual pre-holiday travel frenzy. The gate area is crowded, the air thick with the smell of stale coffee and hurried anticipation. Outside the large windows, the tarmac glistens under the pale December sun, hinting at the potential for snow later in the day.

**Time:** 8:15 AM Mountain Standard Time (MST) on December 20th, 2024.
