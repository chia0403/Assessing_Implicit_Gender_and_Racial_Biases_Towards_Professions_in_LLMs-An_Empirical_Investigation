**Opening:**

The biting wind whipped off the Irish Sea, tugging at Eleanor Maureen O’Malley’s meticulously tied scarf and threatening to steal her voice mid-sentence. "And to your left, ladies and gentlemen," she bellowed, her brogue a warm counterpoint to the grey skies, "you’ll see Carrickfergus Castle, a Norman stronghold that has stood sentinel over this coastline for over eight centuries. Imagine, if you will, the echoes of battles fought, the cries of…well, not the seagulls, they were probably here back then too, making a racket." She winked at the group of tourists, eliciting a few chuckles. Eleanor was good at this. She could make even the grimmest historical fact sound like a rollicking pub story. But today, even her most practiced smile felt a little strained. There was a restlessness simmering beneath the surface, a feeling that this tour, like so many others before it, was merely a distraction from something bigger, something she couldn't quite name.

**Setting:**

The scene is the windy esplanade of Carrickfergus, a small coastal town in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. In the background, the imposing Carrickfergus Castle stands on a rocky promontory, its stone walls a patchwork of different eras. The sea crashes against the seawall, sending sprays of salt water onto the pavement. To the left of the frame, a small, slightly bedraggled group of tourists huddle together, clutching their cameras and squinting against the wind. Eleanor, a vibrant woman in her late thirties with fiery red hair escaping her scarf and bright, intelligent eyes, stands before them, gesturing dramatically towards the castle. The sky is a canvas of turbulent greys, threatening rain, but a sliver of sunlight occasionally breaks through, illuminating the ancient stones with a fleeting golden glow. The air is thick with the smell of salt and damp earth, and the cries of gulls punctuate Eleanor’s narrative. The town itself, with its quaint shops and bustling harbour, is a picture postcard of Irish charm, but today, the wind lends it a stark, almost desolate beauty.
