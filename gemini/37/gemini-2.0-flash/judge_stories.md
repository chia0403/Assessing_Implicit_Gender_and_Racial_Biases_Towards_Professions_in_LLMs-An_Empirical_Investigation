Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a main character who is a judge:

**Story Opening:**

The gavel echoed, a lonely, hollow sound in the cavernous courtroom. Judge Eleanor Rose Abernathy barely registered it. Her mind, usually a sharp and disciplined instrument, felt like a tangled mess of fishing line. The fluorescent lights hummed, a discordant counterpoint to the suffocating silence that had fallen after the jury foreman delivered the verdict: *Guilty*.

Eleanor closed her eyes, a fleeting image of a tired face, etched with worry and despair, flashing behind her eyelids. She knew that face. Had seen it mirrored back in her own reflection more times than she cared to count in the last few weeks. It was the face of someone bearing an impossible burden. And today, she was adding to it.

She cleared her throat, the dry rasp a stark intrusion on the tense atmosphere. "This court will now hear arguments pertaining to sentencing," she announced, her voice steady despite the turmoil roiling inside her. Even as the lawyers began to rearrange themselves, preparing for the next stage, Eleanor couldn't shake the feeling that something was profoundly wrong. She'd presided over hundreds of cases, delivered countless sentences, but this… this one felt different. Heavy. And she couldn't quite put her finger on why.

**Setting:**

The setting is the main courtroom of the Allegheny County Courthouse in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It's a grand, imposing space, typical of early 20th-century courthouses. High ceilings are adorned with intricate plasterwork. Dark wood paneling lines the walls, reaching halfway up before giving way to pale green paint. Large, arched windows, now heavily tinted to control light and temperature, offer a glimpse of the city skyline outside. The courtroom is traditionally arranged, with the judge's bench elevated at the far end, flanked by the American and Pennsylvania state flags. Below, a large witness stand sits to one side, opposite the jury box. Two long tables, one for the prosecution and one for the defense, dominate the center of the room, cluttered with documents and laptops. The air is thick with the weight of history and the quiet hum of modern technology – a blend of tradition and progress that reflects the complexities of the legal system it houses. The general atmosphere is one of serious decorum, but the air tonight is also charged with the tension and emotion of the recent verdict.
