## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The late afternoon sun bled orange through the dusty windows of "The Twisted Braid," a small, independent salon tucked away on a side street in the perpetually-chilly coastal town of Astoria, Oregon. Sea air, tinged with the scent of frying fish and salt, pushed against the glass, occasionally rattling the faded hand-painted sign. Inside, the salon was a riot of mismatched chairs, antique mirrors, and overflowing shelves of hair products, each promising miraculous transformations. A half-finished cup of lukewarm Earl Grey sat precariously on the edge of a cutting station, next to a stack of dog-eared magazines featuring airbrushed celebrities with impossibly perfect hair.

**Story Opening:**

Eliza Maeve O’Connell sighed, the sound lost amidst the rhythmic hum of the vintage hairdryer currently blasting heat onto Mrs. Crabtree’s bouffant. Her back ached, her feet felt like concrete blocks, and her patience was fraying faster than the ends of Mrs. Crabtree's chemically-treated hair. It had been a long day, a day filled with demanding clients, disastrous dye jobs, and the lingering dread that clung to her like sea mist. Eliza glanced at the clock above the shampoo bowls – almost six. Just one more appointment after Mrs. Crabtree, and then, blessed freedom. She carefully untangled a stray strand of hair from the dryer's vent, wondering if she’d finally manage to sneak in a quick nap before her own hair started to resemble a bird's nest. The bell above the door jingled, announcing the arrival of the final appointment, and Eliza braced herself. Astoria was a town of secrets, and everyone, it seemed, brought theirs to The Twisted Braid, hoping that a new haircut could somehow wash them all away.
