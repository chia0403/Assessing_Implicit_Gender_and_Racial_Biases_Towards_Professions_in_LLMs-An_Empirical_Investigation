The biting wind clawed at the chrome of Mack's grill, a persistent nag that mirrored the ache in his lower back. He hadn’t moved from behind the wheel in nearly ten hours, and the vast, desolate expanse of the Montana plains wasn’t doing much for his circulation. Inside the cabin, heated to a toasty 75, Waylon Jennings crooned about lost love and rambling men, a soundtrack as familiar to Silas "Si" Bartholomew as the rumble of the eighteen wheels beneath him.

Si glanced at the digital clock embedded in the dashboard: 03:17 AM. Still a long haul to Billings. Outside, the landscape was a monochrome wash of grey: grey sky bleeding into grey fields dusted with a thin layer of fresh snow. The occasional flickering light of a distant farmhouse, a lonely beacon in the pre-dawn gloom, was the only sign of civilization. This stretch of I-90 was a driver’s purgatory – endless, monotonous, and populated only by the ghosts of truckers past.

Si adjusted his trucker cap, the brim casting a deeper shadow over his already weary eyes. He wasn’t a young man anymore. The years behind the wheel, the countless cups of lukewarm coffee, and the relentless vibrations had carved deep lines into his face. He was hauling a load of livestock feed, a particularly pungent cargo that seemed to seep into every crevice of the cab.

He took a long swig of lukewarm coffee from his thermos, the bitter taste a momentary jolt. This run was just another cog in the machine, another paycheck, another mile closer to… well, he wasn’t entirely sure what. Just further down the road, he supposed. That was the life of Silas Bartholomew, a man defined by the asphalt beneath his tires and the endless horizon stretching before him.
