## Story Opening:

The incessant buzzing of the fluorescent lights hummed a discordant counterpoint to the frantic hammering in Arthur Percival Finch's chest. He swiped at the perspiration beading on his forehead, leaving a greasy smear on the already smudged paperwork. He hated Mondays. He especially hated Mondays that involved handwritten death certificates, cryptic police reports, and the faint, lingering aroma of burnt toast clinging to the file in front of him.

Arthur took a deep breath, trying to conjure the zen-like calm his yoga instructor, Bethany (a free spirit with an unsettling fondness for tie-dye and existential dread), had attempted to instill. It wasn't working. All he could think about was Mrs. Henderson, her tear-ravaged face, and the crumpled photo of a smiling young man holding a fishing rod – her son, Michael, the victim of a tragically misfired toaster oven and a poorly ventilated kitchen.

Arthur had processed hundreds of life insurance claims in his ten years at Equitable Assurance, but some stuck. They clawed their way into his thoughts, burrowing beneath the layers of spreadsheets and actuarial tables, leaving a residue of melancholy that no amount of Earl Grey tea could wash away. He knew he should be focusing on the policy details, double-checking beneficiaries, ensuring everything was in order for Mrs. Henderson's payout. He knew he should be efficient, professional, and detached. But he wasn't. He just felt… hollow.

## Setting:

The office of Equitable Assurance, located on the third floor of a nondescript brick building overlooking the bustling Main Street of Harmony Creek, Ohio, was a testament to beige. Beige walls, beige carpeting, beige desks cluttered with beige files. The only splashes of color came from the wilting peace lily in the corner, stubbornly clinging to life despite Arthur's less-than-stellar gardening skills, and the faded motivational posters plastered haphazardly around the cubicles. One, depicting a soaring eagle against a vibrant sunrise, proclaimed, "Soar to Success! Embrace the Opportunity!" Arthur found it particularly grating today.

The air was thick with the recycled breath of twenty-seven stressed-out employees, the clatter of keyboards, and the low drone of a radio station playing a perpetual loop of elevator music and local news. The faint aroma of burnt coffee permeated the air, courtesy of Mr. Henderson (no relation to the grieving Mrs. Henderson, thankfully), who was notoriously incapable of brewing a decent cup. Outside, the sounds of the city filtered through the grimy windows: the rumble of delivery trucks, the honking of impatient drivers, and the distant wail of a siren – a constant reminder that even in Harmony Creek, tragedy could strike at any moment.
