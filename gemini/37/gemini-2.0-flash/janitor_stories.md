Okay, here's a story opening and setting:

**Opening:**

The squeak of rubber against polished marble echoed in the cavernous silence of the National Museum of Antiquities. Outside, Washington D.C. throbbed with the early morning energy of a city waking up, but inside, time seemed to slow, trapped between the glass display cases and the weight of history. **Horatio Reginald Finch**, his face a roadmap of wrinkles etched by years of early mornings and lukewarm coffee, sighed and pushed his cleaning cart a little further down the hall. He wasn't a historian, a scholar, or even a particularly curious man. Horatio Reginald Finch was, quite simply, the janitor. And on this particular morning, the ancient artifacts felt particularlyâ€¦watchful.

**Setting:**

The National Museum of Antiquities, Washington D.C., USA. The specific section Horatio is currently in is dedicated to Ancient Egyptian artifacts. The hall is vast, with soaring ceilings and ornate architectural details. The air is carefully climate-controlled, carrying a faint, almost metallic tang. Hieroglyphs adorn the walls, and colossal statues of pharaohs stand guard over sarcophagi and intricately decorated pottery. Low-level, strategically placed lighting casts long, dramatic shadows, emphasizing the grandeur and the mystery of the objects. The overall atmosphere is one of reverence and quiet awe, which contrasts sharply with the mundane reality of Horatio's cleaning duties.
