The air, heavy with the scent of parched earth and simmering disappointment, hung thick around him, a palpable burden. He ran a hand through his thinning, straw-colored hair, his gaze sweeping across the desolate fields, a silent prayer escaping his lips. Another day gone, another day closer to ruin.
