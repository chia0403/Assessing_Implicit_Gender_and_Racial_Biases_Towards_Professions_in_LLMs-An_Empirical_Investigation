The fluorescent lights of Mrs. Gable's basement buzzed like angry wasps, casting a sickly green glow on the encroaching dampness. Bartholomew "Bart" Butterfield, his name usually a source of amusement but currently feeling like a lead weight in his boots, sighed and hefted his toolbox further onto his shoulder. He could already smell the problem: mildew and something akin to wet, decaying socks. This wasn't just a clogged drain, this was a potential biohazard.

Bart, a plumber of 23 years experience and possessing the girth to show for it, knelt down, his knees cracking in protest. He surveyed the scene: a flooded basement, a wheezing sump pump coughing its last, and a history of neglect plastered on every peeling paint chip and rust-stained pipe. The house, located in the perpetually overcast town of Oakhaven, nestled deep in the Pennsylvania countryside, was old. Oakhaven was a town where nothing ever seemed to change, including the plumbing. And Mrs. Gable, a woman Bart suspected hadn't updated anything since the Eisenhower administration, was exactly the kind of client who made him question his life choices, even if she did always offer him lukewarm instant coffee and stale cookies. This job, he knew, was going to be a long one.
