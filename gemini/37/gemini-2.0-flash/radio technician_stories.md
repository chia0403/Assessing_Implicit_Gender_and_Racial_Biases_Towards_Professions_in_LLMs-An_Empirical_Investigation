## Story Opening:

The hum was back. It was a low, insidious thrum that vibrated through the steel grate of the floor and tickled the fillings in Amelia Bellweather's teeth. Not the pleasant, even hum of properly calibrated vacuum tubes, but a dissonant, parasitic vibration that spoke of cosmic indigestion and things best left undisturbed. She frowned, wiping a smear of grease from her already-grimy cheek with the back of her hand, and glared at the towering array of radio equipment that lined the walls of her cramped workspace. It wasn't supposed to be back. Not after all the rewiring, the painstaking calibration, the ritualistic offerings of stale coffee to the temperamental oscillators. Not after she’d practically rebuilt the blasted thing from the ground up.

**Setting:**

The year is 1957. The place is a remote, subterranean research facility nestled deep beneath the Nevada desert, codenamed "Echo Base". The air inside is thick with the scent of ozone, heated metal, and the faint, lingering aroma of whatever institutional meals were served yesterday. Fluorescent lights flicker erratically above, casting long, distorted shadows that dance across the labyrinthine corridors. Amelia’s workshop is a chaotic sanctuary, crammed with oscilloscopes, soldering irons, spools of wire, and half-disassembled radio components. Government-issued beige lockers line one wall, overflowing with spare parts and half-eaten boxes of crackers. The only window is a small, reinforced porthole that offers a view of nothing but packed earth and the occasional scurrying desert rodent. Outside, the Cold War rages. Inside, something far stranger is brewing.
