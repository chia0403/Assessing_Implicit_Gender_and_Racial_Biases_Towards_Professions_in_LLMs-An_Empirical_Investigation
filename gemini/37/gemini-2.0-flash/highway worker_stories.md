The sun beat down on the cracked asphalt, turning the air thick and hazy. Humidity hung heavy, clinging to everything like a damp blanket. Beads of sweat trickled down the temples of **Elias "Eli" Theodore Harrison**, soaking into the faded bandanna tied around his forehead. He squinted, the glare bouncing off the orange cones he'd just finished positioning. Heat shimmered above the endless stretch of Highway 66, blurring the already distant horizon.

This particular section of 66, about thirty miles west of Kingman, Arizona, was Eli's personal purgatory. He'd been assigned this stretch – affectionately nicknamed “The Devil’s Dance Floor” by the crew – for the last six months. Constant traffic, unforgiving sun, and a seemingly endless cycle of patching potholes and repainting lines. Eli wasn’t complaining, not really. He was a highway worker, born and bred. It was honest work, out in the open air. But even honest work could feel like a slow burn under the Arizona sun. Today was no different. Today felt… different. An uneasy feeling, like the air before a dust storm, prickled the back of his neck. He just couldn’t shake the feeling that something was about to change on the Devil's Dance Floor.
