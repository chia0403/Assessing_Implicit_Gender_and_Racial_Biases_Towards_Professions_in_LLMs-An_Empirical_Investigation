The fluorescent lights of the firm hummed a monotonous tune that threatened to burrow into Amelia Josephine Hernandez’s skull. It was Tuesday, 7:17 PM, and Amelia was still knee-deep in deposition transcripts, highlighter bleeding a garish yellow across her fingertips. Outside, the late June heat was finally breaking, promising a balmy summer night. Inside, however, the climate control system in the offices of Sterling, Blackwood & Finch continued its valiant but ultimately futile battle against the collective body heat of exhausted lawyers and equally exhausted paralegals.

Amelia wasn’t supposed to be here this late. Not tonight. Tonight was supposed to be pasta and wine with her best friend, Maya, a much-needed escape from the soul-crushing minutiae of litigation. But Partner Blackwood, notorious for his "just one more thing" policy, had dropped a stack of documents on her desk just before closing time, muttering something about "crucial evidence" and "a high-stakes case."

The setting was the 37th floor of the Sterling Tower, a monolith of steel and glass that dominated the Chicago skyline. From Amelia’s cubicle, she could see a sliver of Lake Michigan shimmering in the twilight, a tantalizing reminder of a world outside legal briefs and looming deadlines. Her small, cluttered space was a testament to her dedication - overflowing with files, legal pads filled with frantic notes, and a small, wilting peace lily that she’d optimistically named "Justice." The air smelled faintly of stale coffee and desperation, a potent cocktail that perfectly captured the mood of the office after hours.
