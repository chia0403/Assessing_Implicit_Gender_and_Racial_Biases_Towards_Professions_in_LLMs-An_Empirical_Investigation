The biting wind whipped across the exposed steel girders, a relentless, howling adversary that tried to tear at Elias James Carter's thick gloves. He leaned into it, the familiar metallic tang of welding smoke stinging his nostrils as he secured another beam onto the skeletal framework of the Titan Tower. Below him, the city of Zenith sprawled like a glittering, impossibly complex circuit board, the yellow taxi lights tracing paths of frantic energy through the concrete canyons.

Elias hated heights, a fact he kept meticulously hidden from his crew. But he loved building, seeing something solid and enduring rise from nothing, a testament to human ingenuity and brute force. And the Titan Tower was going to be a monument, the tallest structure in the entire state, a symbol of Zenith's booming tech industry. He just hoped it didn't become his tomb.

He was perched on the 47th floor, halfway through his shift, the clang of hammers and the roar of machinery a constant symphony around him. The sun, a weak, watery disc, was beginning its slow descent, casting long, skeletal shadows across the unfinished building. The air was thick with the smell of concrete dust, hot steel, and the faint, acrid scent of rain that threatened on the horizon. This was his world, a world of calloused hands, aching backs, and the silent satisfaction of a job well done. This was Zenith, and Elias James Carter was building its future, one beam at a time.
