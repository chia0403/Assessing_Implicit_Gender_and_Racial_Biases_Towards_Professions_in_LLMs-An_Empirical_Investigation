## Story Opening:

The scent of lemon verbena hung heavy in the air, a testament to the hours spent scrubbing the marble countertops in the kitchen. Amelia Rose Thornton sighed, the familiar ache settling in her lower back. It was always the countertops. Mrs. Hawthorne, bless her gilded heart, insisted on them being “gleaming, like a summer morning,” whatever that meant. Amelia had long ago decided it meant scrubbing until her reflection stared back at her, slightly distorted, but undoubtedly there. She ran a calloused hand over the cool, smooth surface, satisfied, and stepped back to survey her domain.

## Setting:

Amelia stood in the sprawling kitchen of Hawthorne Manor, perched precariously on the cliffs overlooking the turbulent Cornish coastline. The house was a gothic behemoth, built by a shipping magnate in the late 1800s and passed down through generations of Hawthornes. Think imposing granite walls, stained glass windows depicting scenes from Arthurian legend, and labyrinthine corridors that swallowed the morning light. While the views were breathtaking – on a clear day, you could see the Isles of Scilly shimmering on the horizon – the house itself was damp, drafty, and perpetually shrouded in a misty gloom that seeped into your bones. The kitchen, however, was the warmest room in the house, equipped with a modern Aga cooker, copper pots hanging from the ceiling, and enough space to host a small dinner party, even though Mrs. Hawthorne rarely entertained. It was, in its own way, a sanctuary, a small island of order and cleanliness in the sprawling, slightly decaying grandeur of Hawthorne Manor.
