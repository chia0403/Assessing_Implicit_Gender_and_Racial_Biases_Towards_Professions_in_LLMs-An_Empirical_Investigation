The wind, a hungry wolf, gnawed at the edges of the quarry, ripping whispers through the jagged peaks of the Mournstone Mountains. Every gust carried the fine, biting dust of granite, a perpetual reminder of the mountain’s stubborn heart. Here, on a narrow ledge carved into the cliff face, worked Marius Thorne, his calloused hands dancing a brutal ballet with chisel and mallet.

Marius Thorne wasn’t a man for poetry, despite the evocative name of his homeland. He was a man of stone, of measurable angles and unwavering lines. His muscles, honed by years of relentless work, strained beneath his thick, wool tunic. The leather of his apron, permanently stiff with dust and sweat, creaked with each swing of the mallet. He ignored the wind’s complaints, ignored the biting chill that seeped into his bones, ignored everything except the nascent shape emerging from the rough-hewn block before him.

The Mournstone Mountains were not known for their beauty. They were bleak, unforgiving, and the color of ash. Few dared to venture into their desolate embrace, except for the quarrymen, driven by need or, in Marius’s case, a grim, ingrained dedication. The village of Dustwind, a cluster of stone shacks clinging precariously to the mountainside below, was wholly dependent on the quarry. Life was hard, hope was scarce, and the only beauty to be found resided in the shapes coaxed from the unyielding stone.
