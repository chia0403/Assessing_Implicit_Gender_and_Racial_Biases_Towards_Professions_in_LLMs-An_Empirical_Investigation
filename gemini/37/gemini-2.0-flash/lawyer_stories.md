## Story Opening:

The hum of the fluorescent lights in the evidence room seemed to vibrate deep within Alistair Humphrey Bellweather's bones. He rubbed the bridge of his nose, the faint scent of stale coffee and dusty cardboard doing little to alleviate the dull throb behind his eyes. Outside, a relentless November rain lashed against the grimy windows of the Old Courthouse, mirroring the storm brewing inside him. He hadn't slept properly in days, fuelled by lukewarm coffee and the gnawing anxiety that his entire career, everything heâ€™d built, was about to come crashing down around him. He just had to find something, *anything*, that could prove his client was innocent. He stared at the contents of Exhibit A: a tarnished silver locket, its clasp broken and tarnished, lying forlornly on a plastic evidence bag. It was supposed to contain the answer, the key to unlocking the truth. But all Alistair saw was another piece of damning evidence, whispering guilt in the suffocating silence of the room.

## Setting:

The story is primarily set in and around the Old Courthouse of Ashworth, a decaying Victorian behemoth located in the industrial city of Harrowgate, in the North of England. Harrowgate is a city grappling with post-industrial decline, struggling to reinvent itself amidst unemployment and a pervasive sense of stagnation. The Old Courthouse itself is a reflection of the city's decline: its once-grand facade is crumbling, stained with years of grime, and the interior is a maze of dimly lit corridors, antiquated courtrooms, and overflowing filing rooms. The building is rumored to be haunted, both by the ghosts of past trials and the metaphorical weight of justice dispensed within its walls. Outside the courthouse, the city is a tapestry of grey brick terraces, abandoned factories, and bustling pubs clinging to a sense of community. The November weather adds to the oppressive atmosphere, with perpetual rain and a biting wind that seems to seep into every crack and crevice, both in the buildings and the lives of its inhabitants.
