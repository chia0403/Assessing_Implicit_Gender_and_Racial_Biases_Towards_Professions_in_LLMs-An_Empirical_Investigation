## Story Opening:

The sickly sweet scent of artificial pine clung to the air like a persistent cough. Bartholomew "Barry" Finch wrinkled his nose, adjusting the knot of his tie. He hated these forced Christmas marketing events. He preferred the brutal honesty of January, where he could sell people things they actually needed, not sparkly baubles and flimsy, overpriced gadgets.

Barry blew warm breath onto his fingers, trying to thaw them. The wind, a biting January gust, snaked through the gaps in the hastily constructed tent, swirling around his ankles. He could see his breath puffing out in little white clouds. Just perfect.

"Another beautiful day in paradise," he muttered to himself, pulling his cheap wool coat tighter around him. He straightened his posture, forcing a smile onto his face. The first victim... err, customer... was approaching. Time to engage.

## Setting:

The scene takes place on a bitterly cold January morning, the day after New Year's Day, in a small, windswept town square. A temporary "Winter Wonderland" marketing event has been erected, consisting of several flimsy tents housing various vendors trying to offload unsold Christmas inventory. The ground is uneven, covered in patches of dirty snow and discarded tinsel. The air is thick with the smell of stale gingerbread and disappointment. Across the square, the municipal Christmas tree, now brown and drooping, stands forlornly. Bare trees line the edges of the square, their branches scratching against the gray sky. The general atmosphere is one of post-holiday blues and dwindling hope.
