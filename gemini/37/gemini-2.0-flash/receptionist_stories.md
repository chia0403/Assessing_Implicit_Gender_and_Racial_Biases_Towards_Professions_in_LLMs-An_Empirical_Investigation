## Story Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

The fluorescent lights of the lobby hummed a monotonous tune, a sound Beatrice Eleanor Ainsworth had long ago learned to filter out. Today, however, the hum seemed amplified, mirroring the persistent thrum of anxiety in her own chest. It was almost noon, and still, no sign of Mr. Henderson. Beatrice glanced at the clock on the wall, its sterile white face mocking her with its unwavering accuracy. 11:58 AM. Two minutes to go. Two minutes until the end of her shift, and potentially, the end of her sanity.

**Setting:**

Beatrice worked at the front desk of "Synergy Solutions," a mid-sized tech firm specializing in data analytics. The office occupied the entire 17th floor of a glass and steel high-rise in the heart of downtown Chicago. The lobby was a carefully curated display of corporate blandness: neutral beige walls adorned with abstract artwork that was undoubtedly very expensive but said absolutely nothing. Polished chrome accents reflected the relentless glare of the city outside. A large, angular reception desk, constructed from what looked like petrified wood and illuminated from below, served as Beatrice’s command center. From here, she could control access to the entire floor, fielding calls, greeting visitors, and desperately trying to maintain a semblance of order in the chaotic ecosystem of Synergy Solutions. To her left, a sprawling waiting area offered uncomfortable leather chairs and an outdated selection of magazines. To her right, a glass door led into the dimly lit, and perpetually buzzing, heart of the office – a maze of cubicles and server rooms that Beatrice preferred to avoid whenever possible.
