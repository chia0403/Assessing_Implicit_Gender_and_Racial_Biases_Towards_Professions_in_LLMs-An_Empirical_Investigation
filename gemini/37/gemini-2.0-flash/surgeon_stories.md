The sterile scent of antiseptic clung to everything in Operating Room 7, a familiar comfort to Dr. Eleanor Vivian Sterling. This wasn't her favorite OR – she preferred the one with the larger skylight, the one where a sliver of afternoon sun could occasionally pierce through and remind her of the world outside. This one felt claustrophobic, the walls a relentless, unyielding white, mirroring the stark reality of the life-and-death dramas that unfolded within. A low, rhythmic beep emanated from the cardiac monitor, a steady counterpoint to the hushed murmur of her surgical team. Eleanor’s gloved hands, illuminated by the powerful overhead lamps, were a study in focused grace as she held the delicate tissue retractors, her brow furrowed in concentration. Sweat beaded on her forehead, but she didn't flinch, didn't even blink. The fate of Mr. Henderson, a retired schoolteacher with a congenitally weakened aorta, rested in her hands, and Eleanor refused to let anything distract her. This, this precise, almost meditative state, was her sanctuary, her battlefield, her everything.
