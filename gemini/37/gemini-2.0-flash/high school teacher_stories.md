**Opening:**

The flickering fluorescent lights of room 304 seemed to hum along to Ms. Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s mounting anxiety. It was the last period on a Friday – that sweet siren song of the weekend for most, but for her, it was the precipice of parent-teacher conferences. Her desk, usually meticulously organized, was now a battlefield of half-finished grade sheets, hastily scribbled notes about "potential" and "needs improvement," and enough sticky notes to wallpaper a small bathroom. The air was thick with the stale scent of dry-erase markers and the lingering phantom perfume of a student who’d overdone it on the body spray.

**Setting:**

Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s life revolved around Northwood High, a sprawling, brick behemoth on the edge of Maple Creek, a small town clinging to the banks of the Willow River. Northwood was the kind of school where tradition ran deep, from the faded blue and gold banners adorning the gymnasium to the annual rivalry football game that practically shut down the entire town. Amelia had been teaching English Literature there for five years, after graduating from the very same school herself. Room 304, her classroom, was on the third floor, overlooking the football field. It was a space she had slowly, painstakingly made her own: posters of classic novels plastered the walls, alongside student artwork and encouraging quotes penned in calligraphy above the whiteboard. A comfortable armchair sat nestled in the corner near a overflowing bookshelf – Amelia's attempt to create a calming oasis in the sometimes chaotic world of high school. Even with its personal touches, though, the room felt sterile under the oppressive glare of the fluorescent lights, a constant reminder of the institutional nature of her work. Outside the window, the November sky was a bruised purple, threatening a snowstorm, and the wind rattled the old panes, mirroring the nervous tremor in Amelia's hands as she straightened the stack of conference schedules one last time.
