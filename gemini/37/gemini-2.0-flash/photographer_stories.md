The salt spray stung Emilia Rose Carter’s face, a familiar discomfort she barely registered. The wind, a raucous shouter this morning, whipped her hair into a tangled frenzy, mirroring the churning grey canvas that stretched out before her. She gripped her battered Nikon, its cold metal reassuring against the wildness of the day, and peered through the viewfinder.

Emilia stood on the edge of the crumbling, moss-slicked cliffs of Duncansby Head in the Scottish Highlands. This far north, the land felt raw, ancient, a place where the veil between worlds was thin enough to catch on the wind. The biting air carried the scent of peat, brine, and something else, something indefinable, almost metallic. Below her, the Stacks of Duncansby, jagged fingers of weathered sandstone, clawed defiantly out of the turbulent North Sea, each wave a white-knuckled fist crashing against their base.

This was the place she’d come to lose herself, to find something worth holding onto amidst the wreckage of her past. It was the place she hoped her photography could finally find its voice. Today, she was hunting the light, that elusive, ethereal glow that only painted the Highlands in the fleeting moments between storm clouds. Today, she was hunting for a photograph that could mend a broken soul.
