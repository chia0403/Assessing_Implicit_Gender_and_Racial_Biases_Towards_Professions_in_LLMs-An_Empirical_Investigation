## Story Opening:

The scent of freshly cut bluegrass, laced with the subtle tang of damp earth and a hint of roses nearing their peak bloom, hung heavy in the morning air. For Bartholomew "Bart" Finch, it was the perfume of contentment, the aroma of a job well done, a life lived among the green. He leaned against the ancient oak that stood sentinel over the lower gardens, a worn pruning shear dangling from his calloused hand. Bart watched the sunrise paint the stone walls of Oakhaven Manor in hues of rose and gold, a silent symphony only he and the morning birds were privileged to witness.

He knew, though, that the peace wouldn't last. Not today.

The whispers had been growing louder, more insistent, swirling around Oakhaven like the early morning mist. Whispers of restless spirits, of shadowed figures glimpsed in the long corridors, of a chill that settled deeper than the autumn air warranted. Bart, a man of practicalities and pruning shears, had dismissed them as the idle fancies of the privileged class, until last night. Last night, he had seen it himself: a flickering light in the abandoned west wing, a light no power source could explain. And with it, a disquiet he couldn't shake, a feeling that something ancient and unhappy had been roused within the manor’s aged walls.

## Setting:

**Oakhaven Manor** is a sprawling, Gothic Revival estate nestled deep within the rolling hills of the English countryside. Built in the late 18th century, it has passed through generations of the Ashworth family, each leaving their mark on its imposing structure and meticulously manicured grounds.

The estate encompasses several distinct areas:

*   **The Manor House:** A three-story structure with towering turrets, pointed arch windows, and gargoyles leering from the rooftops. The interior is a labyrinth of long corridors, grand ballrooms, and dusty libraries, filled with antique furniture and portraits of stern-faced Ashworths. The west wing, damaged by fire decades ago, has been abandoned and sealed off, adding to the manor's mystique.

*   **The Formal Gardens:** A meticulously planned and maintained expanse of sculpted hedges, rose gardens, and fountains. Bart takes immense pride in the formal gardens. He maintains the boxwood hedges with precision, carefully tending to the prize-winning roses.

*   **The Lower Gardens:** A more wild and natural area, featuring a rambling orchard, a small pond surrounded by weeping willows, and a dense patch of woodland bordering the estate. This is Bart's preferred part of the estate.

*   **The Greenhouses:** A series of Victorian-era glass structures used to cultivate exotic plants and flowers. Currently, they’re mostly neglected.

*   **The Stable Block:** Once bustling with activity, the stables are now mostly empty, save for a few horses used for leisurely rides.

Oakhaven Manor, with its air of faded grandeur and lingering secrets, stands as a testament to a bygone era. But beneath the surface of its idyllic beauty, something is stirring, a darkness that threatens to unravel the carefully cultivated facade. And Bartholomew Finch, the unassuming groundskeeper, finds himself unexpectedly caught in its wake.
