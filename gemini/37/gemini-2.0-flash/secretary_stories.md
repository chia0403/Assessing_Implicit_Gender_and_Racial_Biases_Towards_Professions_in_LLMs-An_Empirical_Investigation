The fluorescent lights of Harrington & Finch buzzed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Beatrice Eleanor Ainsworth's increasingly monotonous life. 8:58 AM. Two more minutes before the clock declared the official start to another day of fielding Mr. Harrington's incessant phone calls (mostly about golf), deciphering Mr. Finch's cryptic meeting notes (chicken scratch doesn't begin to describe it), and ensuring the mahogany conference table was perpetually polished to a blinding sheen.

Beatrice sighed, the sound barely audible above the hum of the server in the corner of the office. She straightened her sensible, navy blue skirt and smoothed down the collar of her crisp white blouse. Image was everything at Harrington & Finch, a prestigious (read: stuffy) law firm nestled in the heart of Boston's financial district. Her desk, strategically positioned between the partners' offices and the rest of the staff, was a carefully curated tableau of efficiency. A perfectly aligned stack of legal pads, a sleek, silver pen holder, and a meticulously organized Rolodex were all testament to her dedication to her job. Or, perhaps, her dedication to maintaining the illusion of control in a world that often felt like it was spiraling out of her grasp.

Outside, the rain hammered against the large, panoramic windows, turning the city skyline into a blurred watercolor painting. Gray clung to everything, both inside and out, mirroring the feeling that had been creeping into Beatrice's bones lately: a persistent, gnawing sense that there had to be more to life than beige walls, legal jargon, and the distinct aroma of old money and impending boredom.
