The incessant beeping of the heart rate monitor seemed to mock Eleanor Rose Mallory. She hated the sound, the way it punctuated the silence of her small, sterile office, each blip a tiny, insistent reminder of mortality. And today, more than any other day in her eight years as a dental hygienist, mortality felt awfully close.

Eleanor wasn't in her usual brightly lit treatment room, the one adorned with pictures of cartoon teeth grinning widely, and the reassuring scent of mint disinfectant. Instead, she sat in the cramped, dimly lit basement of St. Jude's Home for the Elderly, a place that smelled perpetually of dust, institutional soap, and impending death. The "office" was a closet, really, crammed with a rickety chair, a folding card table that served as her instrument tray, and a portable suction unit that wheezed more than it sucked.

St. Jude's, perched precariously on the bluffs overlooking the muddy Mississippi River in Natchez, Mississippi, was a far cry from Eleanor's usual clientele of soccer moms and sweet tea-guzzling teenagers. Here, the teeth were yellowed and brittle, often clinging stubbornly to fading gums. The conversations, when there were any, were a mumbled mix of nostalgia, confusion, and whispered complaints about aches and pains. And the heart rate monitors, borrowed from the nursing staff, were almost always necessary, a stark reminder of the delicate balance Eleanor was navigating with each delicate scraping motion.
