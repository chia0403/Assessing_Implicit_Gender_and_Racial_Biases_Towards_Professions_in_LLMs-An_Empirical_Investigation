## Story Opening & Setting:

**Opening:**

The humid New Orleans air clung to Amelia Grace Dubois like powdered sugar on a freshly frosted cupcake. She meticulously piped a delicate, buttercream fleur-de-lis onto the side of the elaborate wedding cake, her brow furrowed in concentration. A bead of sweat trickled down her temple, threatening to smudge the perfect swirl. “Merde,” she muttered under her breath, grabbing a clean, damp cloth. Today was supposed to be smooth sailing. Today was supposed to be the pinnacle of her summer season at “Amelia Grace’s Sweet Surrender,” but the temperamental August weather, coupled with the bride’s increasingly demanding instructions (the pearls *had* to be exactly a shade of ivory, not cream!), were testing even Amelia's legendary patience.

**Setting:**

Amelia Grace Dubois owns and operates "Amelia Grace's Sweet Surrender," a charming, albeit slightly run-down, bakery nestled in the heart of the French Quarter, New Orleans. The building itself is a three-story shotgun house, painted a cheerful, slightly faded, shade of mint green. Wrought-iron balconies overflowing with vibrant bougainvillea vines adorn the second and third floors, providing a picturesque backdrop to the bustling street.

Inside, the bakery is a riot of color and scent. Display cases gleam with meticulously decorated cakes, cookies, and pastries. The aroma of vanilla, cinnamon, and freshly baked bread hangs heavy in the air, mingling with the faint scent of jasmine from the courtyard garden visible through the back windows. Tables are mismatched and covered in checkered tablecloths, offering a cozy and inviting space for customers to linger. The walls are adorned with vintage baking advertisements and photographs of Amelia's family, a legacy of bakers stretching back generations in New Orleans. Behind the counter, a large, stainless steel kitchen hums with activity, a constant whir of mixers and the clatter of pans. The air is thick with the energy of creation, and the slightly frenetic pace required to keep up with the city's insatiable appetite for sugar.
