Okay, here's a story opening and setting, featuring a pharmacist named Eleanor Maeve Sterling:

**Setting:** The sleepy coastal town of Port Blossom, Maine. The air is thick with the scent of salt and brine, mixed with a subtle undertone of pine from the surrounding woods. Port Blossom is a place where everyone knows everyone, the pace of life is deliberately slow, and the most exciting thing to happen in a week is usually Mrs. Hawthorne's cat getting stuck in a tree. The town’s heart, and Eleanor’s place of work, is the "Sterling Pharmacy," a two-story clapboard building painted a faded ocean blue, located right on Main Street. Its windows are cluttered with hand-painted signs advertising everything from cough drops to lobster-themed hand lotion.

**Opening:**

The bell above the door of Sterling Pharmacy jingled, a sound Eleanor Maeve Sterling knew as well as her own heartbeat. It was a sound that usually heralded a simple prescription refill, a request for sunscreen, or perhaps old Mr. Abernathy needing help navigating the "confusing childproof" lid on his arthritis cream. This time, however, the woman who stepped inside shattered the tranquil normalcy of a Tuesday afternoon in Port Blossom.

She was tall and elegant, her dark hair pulled back in a severe bun that somehow accentuated her sharp cheekbones. A pair of oversized sunglasses obscured her eyes, but Eleanor could sense the tension radiating off her like heat from a wood stove. She wore a crisp, tailored suit that looked utterly out of place amidst the faded floral wallpaper and the display of novelty rubber ducks waddling across the counter.

“I need something,” the woman said, her voice low and husky, carrying a faint accent Eleanor couldn't quite place, "for… well, for a headache. A very bad headache." She paused, her gaze darting nervously around the pharmacy. "But not just anything. Something… discreet." Eleanor, ever the observant pharmacist, immediately knew this wasn't about a simple headache. This was something far more complicated, and possibly far more dangerous, brewing beneath the surface of Port Blossom's serene façade.
