## Story Opening:

The pre-dawn air hung thick and heavy with the scent of salt and something akin to burnt caramel. Elias Thorne, his breath clouding in front of him, shivered and tugged the collar of his worn Carhartt jacket higher. He adjusted the weight of his tool bag, the familiar clink of pliers and wire strippers a comforting counterpoint to the unsettling creaks and groans emanating from the lighthouse. He squinted up at the towering structure, a skeletal finger pointing accusingly at the inky sky. Even after five years of maintaining the electrical systems of the islands scattered off the Maine coast, the sheer scale of the place still gave him the willies. Today's job, however, wasn't the height that unsettled him; it was the insistent message from the mainland, crackling over the radio, about unusual activity reported by the automated sensors. Something was drawing an ungodly amount of power, and it was Elias Thorne's job to find out what.

## Setting:

The story begins on **Isle au Haut, Maine**, specifically at the base of the **Eagle Point Lighthouse**. It's a blustery morning in early **November**, the air thick with the approaching winter. The lighthouse itself is a classic, imposing structure built of granite, its whitewashed paint peeling in places. It sits perched on a rugged, rocky point overlooking the churning Atlantic Ocean. The surrounding landscape is a mix of windswept pine trees, scrubby bushes, and exposed granite bedrock, all perpetually damp with sea spray. The only other sign of human habitation is a small, weather-beaten generator shed tucked behind the lighthouse, humming a monotonous tune that seems to vibrate through the very bones of the island. The feeling is one of stark isolation and the untamed power of nature, a place where the veil between the ordinary and the extraordinary feels thin.
