## Story Opening:

The insistent buzzing of the old landline vibrated against Dr. Eleanor Marguerite Vance's temple, a discordant counterpoint to the Bach she'd chosen to soothe her frayed nerves. Sunlight, thin and anemic after a week of perpetual Seattle drizzle, angled through the stained-glass window depicting St. Jude, the patron saint of hopeless causes. Eleanor sighed, the sound ruffling the dust motes dancing in the beam. Another hopeless cause, no doubt, calling from the brink. Another life unravelling thread by agonizing thread.

She hesitated, hand hovering over the receiver, already bracing herself for the familiar cocktail of despair, anxiety, and righteous indignation that would inevitably be poured out into her listening ear. She'd seen it all, or so she thought. Marital implosions, existential crises, the quiet, creeping agony of unfulfilled potential. But something in the relentless, demanding buzz felt different, sharper somehow. Reluctantly, she picked up the phone. "Dr. Vance speaking."

## Setting:

Dr. Eleanor Marguerite Vance's practice, "Sanctuary Counseling," occupied the top floor of a converted Victorian house in the Queen Anne neighborhood of Seattle. The building, painted a soft, muted green, exuded an aura of faded grandeur, its intricate trim hinting at a more opulent past. Inside, Eleanor had strived to create a space that felt both comforting and professional.

The waiting room was furnished with overstuffed armchairs covered in floral fabrics, a low coffee table laden with well-worn magazines, and a watercolor print of a Puget Sound seascape. Her office, however, was a more personal reflection of her own character. Bookshelves lined one wall, overflowing with tomes on psychology, philosophy, and even a surprising number of detective novels. A worn Persian rug covered the hardwood floor, adding warmth to the otherwise somewhat formal space. On her desk, amidst the clutter of appointment books, patient files, and pens, sat a framed photograph of a younger Eleanor, laughing with two children who bore a striking resemblance to her. The photograph, a bittersweet reminder of a life she'd once envisioned, offered a glimpse into the woman behind the professional facade. The entire space, in its quiet, slightly eccentric way, was a testament to Eleanor's own dedication to providing a sanctuary for those lost in the turbulent seas of their own lives.
