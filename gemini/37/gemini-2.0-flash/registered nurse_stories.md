## Story Opening:

The astringent scent of antiseptic clung to the air, a familiar blanket around Eleanor "Ellie" Vance, RN, as she pushed through the heavy double doors into the cardiac intensive care unit. The rhythmic beeping of monitors, the hushed whispers of colleagues, the soft whoosh of ventilators – it was a symphony Ellie both loved and loathed, a constant reminder of the fragile thread of life she fought to protect every single day. Tonight, though, the music felt particularly discordant, a chaotic crescendo of alarms and anxieties. A new admission was coming, a young man barely out of his twenties, brought in after a sudden cardiac arrest at the gym. Ellie tightened her grip on the clipboard holding his preliminary information, a knot forming in her stomach. Another one, she thought wearily, too young, too soon.

## Setting:

The story opens at Mercy General Hospital in downtown Chicago. Specifically, the setting is the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit (CICU) on the 8th floor. The unit is a sterile, brightly lit space, divided into individual rooms, each equipped with state-of-the-art monitoring equipment. Large windows offer a panoramic view of the Chicago skyline, a stark contrast to the confined and often desperate atmosphere within. The walls are painted a calming, albeit somewhat sterile, shade of pale green. The floor is a durable, easy-to-clean linoleum, patterned with a subtle, abstract design. Outside the individual rooms is a central nurses' station, perpetually bustling with activity – doctors barking orders, nurses scribbling notes, and the ever-present hum of technology. It's a place of quiet intensity, where life and death hang in the balance. The time is 10:47 PM, and the city lights twinkle beyond the glass, seemingly oblivious to the drama unfolding within the walls of Mercy General.
