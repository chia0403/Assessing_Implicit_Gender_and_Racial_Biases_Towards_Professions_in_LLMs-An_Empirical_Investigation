Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a concierge named Beatrice Eleanor Ainsworth:

**Setting:**

The Grand Imperial Hotel, London. Its marble floors gleamed even under the dim glow of the antique chandeliers. The air, a subtle blend of beeswax polish and the faint, lingering scent of expensive perfume, spoke of generations of whispered secrets and whispered fortunes. Outside, the roar of London's traffic was a muted hum, barely penetrating the thick, soundproofed windows. Inside, all was opulent calm, a carefully curated illusion of timeless elegance. The concierge desk, a vast expanse of polished mahogany, stood as the first bulwark against the outside world, a silent promise of seamless service and discreet assistance.

**Opening:**

Beatrice Eleanor Ainsworth, her silver hair pulled back into a neat chignon, adjusted the angle of the freshly sharpened pencils on her desk. She smoothed the lapel of her perfectly tailored navy blue suit, a uniform as much a part of her as her quiet observation and impeccable manners. It was six in the morning, the city still stirring in its pre-dawn slumber, and Beatrice was, as always, already at her post. The Grand Imperial was a machine, one she helped keep running smoothly, and Beatrice knew that the most crucial shifts were those at the beginning and end of the day.

The first tendrils of daylight crept through the tall windows overlooking Green Park, painting the marble floor in soft hues of grey and rose. Beatrice watched them, a faint, almost imperceptible tightening around her lips. Today was the day. The day Lord Ashworth, notorious art collector and even more notorious philanderer, was due to arrive. And, Beatrice suspected, the day things at the Grand Imperial were likely to getâ€¦complicated.
