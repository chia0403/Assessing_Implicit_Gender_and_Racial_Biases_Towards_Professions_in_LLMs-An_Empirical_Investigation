**Opening:**

The shush rattled in Eleanor Ainsworth's throat, a reflex honed over twenty-three years of guardian-ing the hallowed halls of the Blackwood Public Library. It wasn't directed at anyone in particular, merely a preventative measure, an unspoken warning to the ghosts of loud conversations and crinkling newspaper pages that haunted the quiet corners. Eleanor tucked a stray strand of silver-streaked auburn hair behind her ear and adjusted her spectacles, her gaze sweeping over the familiar landscape of towering bookshelves and plush velvet armchairs. The air, thick with the scent of aged paper and lemon polish, hummed with a comforting predictability that she found almost… narcotic.

**Setting:**

Blackwood Public Library was a grand, if somewhat faded, Victorian edifice. Built in 1888 from the bequest of local philanthropist, Silas Blackwood, it stood proudly on the corner of Elm Street and Oak Avenue, its red brick façade softened by climbing ivy. The large, arched windows offered glimpses of the perpetually grey skies of Blackwood, Oregon, a town known for its logging history and its uncanny ability to attract a constant drizzle.

Inside, the library boasted a vast collection that spanned genres and centuries. From dusty, leather-bound tomes detailing the history of logging in the Pacific Northwest, to brightly colored children's books, to the latest bestselling thrillers, Blackwood Public Library held a literary treasure for everyone. The main reading room was dominated by a soaring, cathedral-like ceiling with intricate plasterwork and a magnificent stained-glass window depicting Athena, the goddess of wisdom, holding aloft a beacon of light. Sunlight, when it dared to pierce the clouds, would paint the room in a kaleidoscope of colours.

Despite its grand architecture, the library felt warm and inviting. Comfortable armchairs were strategically placed near sunny windows, and small reading nooks offered pockets of privacy. The rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the lobby served as a constant, grounding presence, a reminder of the slow, deliberate pace of life within these book-lined walls.
