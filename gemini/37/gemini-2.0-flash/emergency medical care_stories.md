Okay, here’s a story opening and setting, featuring a main character who is an emergency medical care provider:

**Opening & Setting:**

The shriek of the dispatch radio cut through the humid Louisiana air, momentarily eclipsing the symphony of crickets and bullfrogs that usually filled the bayou night.  "Medic 31, respond to a single-vehicle accident on Highway 190, mile marker 47.  Reported vehicle overturned.  Possible entrapment.  Use caution, visibility is poor."

Isabelle "Izzy" Dubois swore under her breath as she yanked her rig into gear, sending gravel spraying from beneath the tires.  The red and blue strobe lights bounced erratically off the Spanish moss draped heavy on the cypress trees lining the narrow highway.  Her partner, a rookie named Kevin, was pale behind the wheel, his knuckles white as he gripped the steering wheel.  "Entrapment," she muttered, more to herself than to him.  Entrapment meant heavy machinery, twisted metal, and often, injuries that clawed at the soul.

The air hung thick and heavy, promising a storm before dawn.  The bayou, usually a source of comfort and familiarity for Izzy, felt oppressive tonight, its secrets lurking in the shadows cast by the intermittent moonlight.  This stretch of Highway 190 was a black ribbon winding through the heart of St. Landry Parish, notorious for its unexpected curves and sudden patches of dense fog.  Tonight, it felt like a trap, waiting to spring. Isabelle Dubois, twenty-eight years old and hardened by five years on the front lines of Acadiana’s emergency services, braced herself.  Whatever awaited her at mile marker 47, she knew it wouldn’t be pretty.
