The fluorescent lights of Krueger & Schmidt Consulting hummed a monotonous tune, a symphony of despair to Elias Thorne's ears. He hunched deeper over his overflowing desk, the green glow of his monitor reflecting in his tired eyes. Another spreadsheet, another quarter's projected losses for a client who probably wouldn't take his advice anyway. Elias, a certified public accountant, prided himself on accuracy, on the unwavering logic of numbers. But lately, the numbers felt less like tools and more like shackles.

His office, if one could call it that, was a cramped cubicle situated in the heart of the 'Financial Forecasting' department. The walls, a depressing shade of beige, were adorned with motivational posters that felt more like ironic taunts. "Think Outside the Box!" one proclaimed, while another insisted, "Teamwork Makes the Dream Work!" Elias knew the only box he was thinking outside of was the one containing his sanity, and the only teamwork he experienced involved passive-aggressive email chains about shared printer malfunctions.

Krueger & Schmidt Consulting occupied the entire 27th floor of the Sterling Building in downtown Chicago. Outside, the city pulsed with life, a vibrant tapestry of ambition and dreams. Inside, in the fluorescent-lit belly of the beast, Elias Thorne felt like a cog in a machine, destined to spend his days wrestling with balance sheets and dodging the condescending gaze of his supervisor, Ms. Peterson. It was Tuesday, October 27th, the air outside was crisp with autumn, and Elias Thorne knew, with a sinking certainty, that today wasn't going to be any different.
