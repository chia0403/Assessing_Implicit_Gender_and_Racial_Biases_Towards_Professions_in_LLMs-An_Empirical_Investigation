## Story Opening:

The rain, as it often did in Seattle, was falling sideways. It plastered itself against the windows of my office, blurring the neon glow of the "Eat Mor Chikin" sign across the street into an impressionistic smear of red and yellow. Inside, the air hung thick with the aroma of stale coffee and forgotten promises. I, **Eleanor "Ellie" Vance**, private detective and owner of the somewhat-less-than-prestigious Vance Investigations, was nursing my third cup of the day and trying to decipher a blurry photo of what looked like a squirrel wearing a tiny fedora.

The case, a supposedly "urgent" matter involving a missing pet rodent, had been presented to me by a woman who reeked of lavender and desperation. Frankly, it was the most excitement I'd had all week, which spoke volumes about the current state of my career. The phone hadn't rung with anything more compelling than a wrong number in days, and my bank account was starting to resemble the aforementioned blurry photograph – fuzzy and hard to make out anything concrete.

Then, the door creaked open, letting in a gust of wind and a man who looked like he’d just stepped out of a noir film. He was tall, broad-shouldered, and wore a trench coat that was doing its best to repel the relentless drizzle. He had the kind of face that had seen too much, the kind that held secrets like a tightly guarded vault. He was exactly the kind of trouble I needed, and probably, the kind I couldn’t afford.

## Setting:

Eleanor Vance's office, Vance Investigations, is located on the second floor of a nondescript brick building in Seattle's Pioneer Square neighborhood. It's a cramped space, barely big enough to swing a cat (a fact Eleanor is grateful for, as she dislikes cats). The walls are a peeling shade of beige, adorned with a framed, slightly crooked certificate proclaiming her P.I. license, and a corkboard covered in old cases, forgotten leads, and grocery lists.

A battered oak desk dominates the room, piled high with files, half-eaten sandwiches, and the aforementioned photo of the squirrel. A chipped ceramic mug, perpetually stained with coffee, sits precariously on the edge. The only source of natural light comes from a grimy window overlooking the perpetually overcast street below.

The overall atmosphere is one of faded glory and quiet desperation. The office has seen better days, much like Eleanor herself. It’s a place where secrets are traded, promises are broken, and sometimes, just sometimes, justice is served. And it smells perpetually of coffee, cigarettes (though Eleanor swore she'd quit), and the lingering ghost of forgotten hopes.
