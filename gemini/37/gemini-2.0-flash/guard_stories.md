## Story Opening:

The midday sun beat down on the crenellations of the east gate, baking the sandstone walls until they radiated heat.  A swarm of buzzing flies, lured by the refuse heaps just beyond the gate, provided the only accompaniment to the rhythmic creak of the rusty hinges. Sergeant Gareth Thorne, sweat plastering his thick, auburn hair to his forehead, shifted his weight, the worn leather of his boots squeaking against the stone floor. He squinted, his blue eyes, usually sharp and observant, struggling to penetrate the shimmering heat haze rising from the arid plains that stretched as far as the eye could see. Another day. Another endless, scorching, uneventful day guarding the Whispering City of Eldoria.

## Setting:

The Whispering City of Eldoria is a walled city perched on a plateau overlooking a vast, arid desert.  The buildings are primarily constructed from sandstone, weathered by centuries of relentless sun and wind.  The city is divided into distinct districts: a bustling merchant quarter with stalls overflowing with exotic goods, a temple district housing ancient shrines dedicated to forgotten gods, a tightly guarded palace district where the enigmatic ruling council resides, and the poorer, more ramshackle districts huddled against the inner walls.  A single, winding river flows through the city, providing the only source of fresh water and carving a lush, green swathe through the otherwise harsh landscape. The east gate, where Gareth Thorne is stationed, is the main access point for travelers and traders coming from the desert, and therefore, a vital point of security and control. It's a place of constant activity, noise, and the ever-present scent of dust, spices, and desperation.
