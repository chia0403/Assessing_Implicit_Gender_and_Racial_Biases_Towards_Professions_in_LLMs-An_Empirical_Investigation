Okay, here's a story opening and setting focusing on a manicurist named Beatrice Eleanor Finch:

**Setting:**

The bell above the door of "Fingertip Fancies" chimed a cheerful, almost aggressive, melody, cutting through the lingering scent of acetone and Beatrice Finch's practiced humming. The salon was a symphony of pastel pinks and lavenders, bordering on saccharine. Walls were adorned with framed pictures of meticulously manicured hands sporting everything from delicate floral patterns to shimmering chrome finishes. Shelves were lined with rows upon rows of nail polish bottles, a rainbow army standing at attention. The air conditioning struggled valiantly against the summer heat, but a faint sheen of perspiration always seemed to cling to Beatrice's forehead as she worked. "Fingertip Fancies" was nestled in the heart of Oakhaven, a small, seemingly idyllic town where gossip spread faster than a rogue cuticle and appearances were everything. The salon itself was a testament to this, a haven for ladies who believed that a perfect set of nails could conquer any challenge, no matter how small.

**Story Opening:**

Beatrice Eleanor Finch attacked Mrs. Henderson's chipped, coral-colored nails with a practiced ferocity that belied her sweet, dimpled smile. She hummed along to the tinny country music emanating from the salon’s speakers, the repetitive lyrics about broken hearts and pickup trucks strangely soothing against the chaos in her own head. "Just a little more shaping on this index finger, darling," she chirped, filing with brisk, precise strokes. Mrs. Henderson, a woman whose life revolved around the Oakhaven Garden Club and the perpetual threat of the neighbor's prize-winning roses, grunted in response, her eyes glued to the latest issue of "Southern Living." Today was Friday, which meant Beatrice had eight more sets of nails to perfect before she could even think about escaping back to her tiny apartment above the bakery. But even the thought of a quiet night with a good book couldn't quite quell the jittery energy that bubbled beneath her skin. Because today, unlike any Friday she’d endured in Oakhaven before, Beatrice Eleanor Finch knew something was about to crack. And it wouldn’t just be nail polish.
