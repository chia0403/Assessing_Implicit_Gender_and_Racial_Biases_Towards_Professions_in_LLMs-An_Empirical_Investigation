The dust motes danced in the single shaft of morning sunlight that pierced the gloom of Elias Thorne's workshop. He sneezed, a short, sharp burst that punctuated the rhythmic rasp of his plane.

Today, however, even the familiar comfort of his craft offered little solace. Today, he was building a coffin.
