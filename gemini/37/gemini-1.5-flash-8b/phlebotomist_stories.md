The fluorescent hum of the lab was a constant, almost imperceptible thrumming, a soundtrack to Elara Nightingale's life.  Rows upon rows of gleaming metal cabinets, each labeled with a precise, clinical script, lined the walls of the Clinical Pathology Department at St. Jude's Hospital.  The air, thick with the antiseptic smell of disinfectant and the faint, metallic tang of blood, was a familiar comfort.  Elara, a phlebotomist with a practiced grace, moved through the sterile environment, her movements as precise and measured as the drips of blood into the vials.  Today, however, a different kind of hum filled the air â€“ a low, persistent buzz of anticipation, a nervous energy that tingled beneath the surface of the usual clinical calm.  The annual "Blood Drive" was underway, and the influx of donors was relentless.
