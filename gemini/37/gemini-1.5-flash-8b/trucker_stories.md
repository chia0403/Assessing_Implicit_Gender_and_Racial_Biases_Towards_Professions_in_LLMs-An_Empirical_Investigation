The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of the Dakotas, stinging Amelia "Milly" Rodriguez's cheeks as she fought the wheel of her 18-wheeler.  Dust devils danced across the cracked earth, obscuring the horizon in a swirling beige haze.  The year was 2042, and the once-fertile farmlands were now a patchwork of cracked earth and stunted, parched vegetation.  Milly, a veteran trucker with the company "Trans-Horizon Logistics", had been hauling agricultural supplements – a desperately needed commodity in this parched and depleted land – for three days.  Each mile was a battle against the unforgiving elements, a test of both her skill and her resolve.


The setting: The vast, desolate plains of the American Midwest, 2042.  A region ravaged by climate change, where once-fertile farmland is now barren and wind-swept.  The air, thick with dust and the acrid smell of burnt earth, hangs heavy.  Isolated, sprawling, dust-choked highways crisscross the land, the only signs of human activity. The cabins of the trucks, like Milly's, offer a claustrophobic respite from the brutal elements.  Inside, technology is both a friend and an adversary – a lifeline in the remote locations and a reminder of the growing technological disparity between those who have and those who haven't.
