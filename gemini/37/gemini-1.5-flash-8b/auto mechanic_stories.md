The greasy haze hung thick in the air, clinging to the chipped paint of the '57 Chevy and the worn leather of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's mechanic's overalls.  Sunlight, fractured and distorted by the grime-coated windows of "Rusty Wrench," sliced through the dust motes, illuminating a miniature city of tools and parts â€“ sockets, wrenches, spark plugs, and a faded, hand-drawn diagram of a carburetor, pinned to a dusty whiteboard.  Barty, a man whose face was as familiar with the smell of burnt oil as it was with the sunrise over the small Appalachian town of Oakhaven, hunched over the engine bay.  His calloused fingers, slick with motor oil, traced the contours of the engine block, a frown etching deep lines into his forehead.  The rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the nearby creek, a constant soundtrack to Oakhaven's quiet life, echoed the steady beat of his pulse.
