Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grime-coated window, illuminating a faded poster of the Taj Mahal, a stark contrast to the overflowing recycling bin beside it.  A half-eaten bowl of lukewarm instant oatmeal sat beside a stack of brochures, their glossy pages promising exotic destinations and thrilling adventures that felt impossibly distant from Amy's cramped office on the second floor of a building that had seen better days.  Amy, a travel agent with a heart full of wanderlust and a bank account mirroring her office's state of disrepair, sighed.  Another Tuesday.  Another day of fielding calls about package deals to the same old resorts, of trying to coax the sparkle back into brochures dulled by time and neglect.  The only real excitement today was the cryptic email from a client named "Seraphina."
