Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, mimicking the frantic rhythm of Dr. Amelia "Amy" Hernandez's heart.  The flickering fluorescent lights cast long, dancing shadows across the cluttered waiting room, where the air hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and fear.  It was a Tuesday night, the kind of night that promised nothing but routine emergencies, yet tonight felt different.  The rhythmic pounding on the steel door, punctuated by panicked gasps, spoke of something more serious.

The clinic, nestled in the heart of the sprawling, impoverished industrial district of South River, was a testament to the tireless dedication of its staff.  Years of neglect had left the building battered and worn, but its chipped paint hid the resilient spirit of those who worked inside.  Dusty, peeling wallpaper framed chipped portraits of past patients, their faces obscured by the grime.  The constant hum of the old refrigerator, the faint scent of coffee from the barely-used machine in the breakroom, and the hushed whispers from within the examination room hinted at the tireless dedication of the doctors and nurses, who worked their shifts surrounded by the constant noise of the city outside, and the ever-present hum of the areaâ€™s factories.  Tonight, however, even that familiar cacophony seemed to amplify the growing sense of unease.
