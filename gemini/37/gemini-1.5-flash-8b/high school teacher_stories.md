The fluorescent lights of Ms. Evelyn Reed's classroom hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the afternoon's quiet drama.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the grimy window, illuminating a half-eaten bag of chips crumpled on the floor, a testament to the midday snacking habits of her tenth-grade English class.  Evelyn, a woman whose neatly-pressed blazer seemed perpetually at odds with the chaotic energy of her students, sighed.  Another day, another battle against the seemingly insurmountable tide of teenage apathy.  Today's topic:  Shakespeare's *Macbeth*.  The air thrummed with an anticipatory, almost palpable, resistance.

The classroom itself was a study in contrasts.  Once a vibrant, well-lit space, its paint chipped in places, desks scratched and scarred from countless years of adolescent rebellion, the once gleaming floor now bore faded streaks of spilled drinks and marker.  This was Room 214 at Westview High, a school steeped in the rusting grandeur of its past glory, a building that had witnessed generations of students come and go, and now found itself struggling to adapt to the restless energy of the new millennium.  The scent of stale coffee, mingled with the pervasive aroma of cheap paper and pencils, hung heavy in the air, a scent that was both familiar and slightly off-putting to Evelyn.
