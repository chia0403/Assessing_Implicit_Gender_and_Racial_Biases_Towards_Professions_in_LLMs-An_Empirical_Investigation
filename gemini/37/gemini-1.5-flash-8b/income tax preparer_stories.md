The fluorescent lights of the "Tax Time Express" hummed, a relentless soundtrack to Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's daily grind.  Rows upon rows of identical beige filing cabinets, each labelled with a meticulously printed year, lined the walls of the cramped office.  A faint smell of stale coffee and desperation hung in the air, a familiar aroma that clung to the space like the lingering anxieties of her clients.  Today,  the queue snaked out the door, a testament to the annual ritual of tax season in the sleepy town of Oakhaven.  Amy,  her fingers flying across the keyboard, meticulously entered deductions and credits, the repetitive clicking a rhythmic counterpoint to the quiet murmur of hushed conversations filtering from the waiting area.  Outside, the crisp autumn air carried the scent of decaying leaves, a stark contrast to the warm, yet slightly oppressive atmosphere inside the office.  The chipped paint on the walls, the faded posters of smiling tax professionals, and the slightly sticky laminate surfaces all spoke of the building's enduring, if somewhat unloved, role in the annual financial choreography of Oakhaven.
