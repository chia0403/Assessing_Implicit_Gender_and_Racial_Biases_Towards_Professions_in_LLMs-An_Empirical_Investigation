The flickering fluorescent lights of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic tapping of her fingers on the worn mahogany desk.  Outside, the relentless grey of the London winter pressed against the single pane window, mirroring the storm brewing within her.  Eleanor, a clinical psychologist specializing in trauma, stared at the chaotic scribbles on the notepad before her, the fractured thoughts and fragmented memories of her latest patient, a young woman named Anya, swirling around her like a tempest.  Anya’s case was unlike anything Eleanor had encountered; the details were disturbingly vivid, yet the underlying emotion was a chilling emptiness.  Eleanor traced the edges of a particularly disturbing image, a grotesque representation of a distorted landscape. This case felt different.  This case felt…unfamiliar.

The small, cluttered office, nestled in a quiet street off Harley Street, was a testament to years of practice.  Bookshelves overflowing with texts on various therapeutic approaches lined one wall, their spines a kaleidoscope of colour against the muted grey of the wallpaper.  A worn leather armchair sat opposite Eleanor's desk, a silent sentinel waiting for the next weary soul to seek solace in its embrace.  A single, vibrant yellow sunflower pressed between the pages of a recently consulted journal sat on the corner of the desk.  It was a small, almost insignificant detail, but Eleanor knew, instinctively, that it was a critical piece of the puzzle.  The city outside, a concrete labyrinth of towering buildings and anonymous faces, felt a thousand miles away in this sanctuary, a space meant for dissecting the human condition.
