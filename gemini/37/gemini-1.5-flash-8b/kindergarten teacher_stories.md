Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of Willow Creek Kindergarten, mimicking the relentless drumming in Elara Nightingale's head.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and petrichor, felt heavy, mirroring the weight of the week that had just passed.  Empty, crayon-stained tables lined the brightly coloured classroom, a stark contrast to the vibrant chaos they'd held just hours before.  Today, the room was hushed, almost ghostly, the only sound the rhythmic patter of the rain against the windows and the occasional sniffle from the half-dozen children huddled in the brightly coloured, plush corner. Elara, a kindergarten teacher with eyes the colour of a stormy sky and a heart filled with a quiet determination, stood by the window, watching the grey landscape blur outside.  The tiny, wooden swing set in the yard, usually a whirlwind of giggling children, hung still, caught in the downpour.
