The chipped porcelain sink, stained a faded, floral-patterned mauve, reflected Amelia Josephine Finch’s face.  Her manicured fingers, stained a delicate rose, traced the faintest of lines on the back of her hand.  The scent of lavender hand cream, mingled with the faintest whiff of jasmine from the overflowing bouquet on the counter, filled the tiny salon, "The Polished Petal."  Sunlight, filtered through the dusty-rose curtains, painted streaks of gold across the room, highlighting the swirling patterns of the Persian rug and the chipped, yet meticulously arranged, ceramic teacups that lined the shelves.  Amelia, her eyes darting around the quiet space,  felt the familiar hum of anticipation. Another Thursday afternoon.  Another opportunity to coax beauty from the mundane.  Another chance to make someone's day just a little brighter, through the subtle art of the manicure.  Outside, the city’s rumble – the distant rumble of a million lives – faded into a soft backdrop, a comforting, if sometimes overwhelming, symphony.
