The flickering fluorescent lights of "The Gilded Scissors," the salon, cast an eerie glow on Amelia "Amy" Beaumont's meticulously organized workstation.  Dust motes danced in the beams, illuminating the shimmering array of hair colours, from the vibrant hues of a sunset to the deep, brooding blacks of a starless night.  Amy, a cosmetologist with a keen eye and even keener fingers, meticulously painted a streak of fiery auburn onto the ends of a client's hair.  The scent of rosemary and lavender hung heavy in the air, a comforting counterpoint to the rhythmic whirring of the hair dryers and the hushed murmur of conversations.  The salon, nestled in the heart of the bustling, yet oddly quiet, industrial district, was a haven of calm amidst the urban chaos.  Large windows, overlooking a sprawling network of railway lines, offered glimpses of the city's relentless energy, a constant reminder of the world outside, a world Amy had chosen to leave behind.
