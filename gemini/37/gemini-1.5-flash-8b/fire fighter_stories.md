The biting wind whipped Amelia Hayes's fire-resistant jacket around her as she surveyed the scene.  Smoke, thick and acrid, hung heavy over the dilapidated Victorian house on Elm Street, clinging to the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks that lined the narrow lane.  Broken glass littered the front yard, splintered like shattered dreams, and a single, flickering ember glowed stubbornly from a shattered windowpane.  The air, usually thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, was now poisoned with the smell of burning insulation and despair.  This was her twenty-eighth fire call on Elm Street since the first of the year, a silent testament to the neighborhood's decline. Elm Street, once the heart of a thriving, close-knit community, now seemed to writhe under a shroud of neglect and unspoken sorrows.  Amelia, a seasoned firefighter with the Oakhaven Volunteer Department, felt a familiar knot of dread tighten in her stomach. This wasn't just another fire; it feltâ€¦personal.
