The biting November wind whipped Amelia Thistlewick's crimson scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks as she surveyed the overgrown expanse of Blackwood Manor's gardens.  Ivy, thick as tangled serpents, choked the once-proud rose bushes.  Dead leaves crunched under her boots, a symphony of autumnal decay that echoed the melancholy settling over the estate.  Blackwood Manor, a Gothic masterpiece shrouded in whispers of tragic secrets and forgotten grandeur, felt more like a mausoleum than a home.  Amelia, groundskeeper, the only soul stirring within its decaying beauty, knew this was no ordinary autumnal cleanup. This year, something feltâ€¦different.


**Setting:** Blackwood Manor, a vast, imposing Gothic mansion nestled within the rolling hills of the Yorkshire Moors.  Its crumbling stone walls, pierced by numerous dark windows, seemed to sigh with the weight of centuries.  The gardens, once meticulously manicured, were now choked with overgrown vegetation and the encroaching presence of ancient, gnarled trees.  A chilling mist clung to the air, often obscuring the path and hinting at the mysteries that lay hidden within the estate's shadows.
