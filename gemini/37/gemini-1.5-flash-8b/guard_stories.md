The biting wind whipped across the jagged peaks of the Whisper Mountains, stinging Sergeant Alistair Finch's cheeks.  Dust, kicked up by the relentless wind, swirled around him, obscuring the already precarious path.  Below, the valley stretched out, a tapestry of emerald green fields and shadowed forests, a stark contrast to the desolate, grey expanse of the mountain pass.  Alistair, his breath clouding in the frigid air, pressed himself against the cold stone of the watchtower, the rhythmic clang of the wind chimes a mournful counterpoint to the howling wind.  He was one of the few remaining guards on the northern perimeter, stationed at the notoriously treacherous Pass of the Broken Moon.  His responsibility, a heavy weight on his broad shoulders, was to protect the fragile peace between the Kingdom of Eldoria and the shadowed lands beyond. The flickering light from the lantern cast long, dancing shadows across the desolate landscape, highlighting the sheer scale of the mountain range, its imposing presence almost tangible in the stark silence.
