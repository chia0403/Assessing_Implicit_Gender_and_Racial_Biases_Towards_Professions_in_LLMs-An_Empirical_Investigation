Rain lashed against the stained-glass windows of the "Grand Guignol," a theatre tucked away on a cobbled side street in the heart of the city, a place where shadows stretched long and menacing in the perpetual twilight.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light illuminating a worn wooden desk.  Amelia Hawthorne, Director of the Grand Guignol, hunched over a stack of play scripts, her brow furrowed in deep concentration.  A single flickering gas lamp cast long, dancing shadows across her face, highlighting the sharp angles of her jawline and the intensity of her gaze.  The air, thick with the smell of old wood and damp earth, vibrated with the faint, persistent rumble of the city outside.  Amelia, a woman of forty-five with eyes that held the fire of a thousand forgotten passions, felt a tremor of apprehension ripple through her. Tonight, the premiere of "The Crimson Curtain" was nigh.  Her most ambitious production to date, and the one that held the key to her artistic future.
