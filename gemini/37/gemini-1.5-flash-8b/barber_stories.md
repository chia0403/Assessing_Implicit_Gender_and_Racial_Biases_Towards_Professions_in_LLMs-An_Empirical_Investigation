The scent of sandalwood and something faintly metallic clung to the air in Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's barbershop, "The Clipper's Edge."  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the grime-streaked window, illuminating a spiderweb clinging precariously to a chipped porcelain sink.  Barty, a man whose prematurely graying hair was artfully sculpted into a neatly trimmed pompadour, meticulously honed the razor in his calloused hand.  The rhythmic *clip-clip* of his shears mingled with the low murmur of the gossiping regulars, a symphony of whispered secrets and muttered complaints, which Barty, with his practiced ear, expertly filtered through like the shavings from a freshly trimmed head.  Today, however, the usual buzz of conversation was muted, replaced by an unnerving quietude.  Outside, the city, usually a roaring beast, lay slumbering in the oppressive heat of a mid-summer afternoon.  Barty, eyes fixed on the glint of the steel, felt a strange unease creep into his bones.  Heâ€™d never known the city to be so still.
