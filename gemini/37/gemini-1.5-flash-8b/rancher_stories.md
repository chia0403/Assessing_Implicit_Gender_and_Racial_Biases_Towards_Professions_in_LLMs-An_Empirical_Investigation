The wind, a relentless, rasping beast, whipped across the parched plains, stinging Elias Thorne's face and rattling the tin roof of the ramshackle cabin.  Dust devils, the colour of burnt umber, danced across the cracked earth, swirling around the skeletal remains of last year's crops.  Elias, a man carved from sun-baked granite and wind-whipped resilience, squinted at the horizon.  Not a blade of green was visible, only a vast, oppressive expanse of ochre and grey.  The drought, they said, was the worst in living memory.  His cattle, the legacy of his grandfather, were dwindling, their ribs showing through their hides like skeletal maps.  He needed rain, desperately.  He needed it to save the Thorne legacy, a legacy etched not only in the land, but in the very blood that ran through his veins.
