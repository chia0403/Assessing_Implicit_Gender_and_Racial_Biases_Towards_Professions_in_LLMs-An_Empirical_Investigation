The chipped porcelain sink, stained a dull, perpetual beige, reflected the sickly yellow glow of the overhead fluorescent light.  Dust motes danced in the air, illuminated like tiny, spectral insects.  Agnes Periwinkle, a woman whose face was etched with the quiet wisdom of a thousand dust bunnies and the relentless passage of time, sighed.  Another day, another meticulously cleaned room in the grand, yet strangely desolate, mansion of the Blackwood family.  The air hung thick with the scent of beeswax polish and unspoken histories.

The Blackwood Manor, perched atop a windswept hill overlooking the grey expanse of the North Sea, was a monument to forgotten grandeur.  Gothic arches, draped in ivy that clung like grasping fingers, framed decaying gardens choked with overgrown roses and the skeletal remains of ancient box hedges.  Rain lashed against the leaded-glass windows, a constant, mournful soundtrack to Agnes's daily routine.  Inside, the house echoed with a hollow emptiness, a tangible presence of absence that clung to every polished surface, every meticulously arranged antique. Agnes knew the Blackwood family had moved on, yet their ghosts lingered, woven into the very fabric of the house.
