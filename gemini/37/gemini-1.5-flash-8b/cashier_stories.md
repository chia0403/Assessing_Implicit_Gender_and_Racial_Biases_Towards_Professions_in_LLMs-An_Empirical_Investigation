The fluorescent lights of the "Every-Thing-You-Need" grocery store hummed, a relentless, almost hypnotic drone that echoed the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Amelia Hawthorneâ€™s fingers on the register.  Dust motes danced in the pale light, illuminating the chipped paint on the walls and the faded posters advertising last month's sale on canned tomatoes.  Amelia, a wisp of a girl with perpetually tired eyes and a braid that seemed to resist any attempt at neatness, stared blankly at the barcode scanner.  Another Tuesday, another endless aisle of beige and fluorescent green.  Outside, the city roared; a symphony of sirens and distant car horns bleeding through the thin concrete walls.  Inside, the only sound was the quiet, almost imperceptible sigh of the aging refrigerator units and the rhythmic *ping* of the scanner.  Amelia, a cashier at Every-Thing-You-Need, was barely present.
