Rain hammered against the panoramic window of Amelia Hayes's office, mirroring the relentless rhythm of her thoughts.  The fluorescent lights of the sprawling, windowless data center hummed, a counterpoint to the storm raging outside.  Amelia, a Systems Analyst at GlobalCorp, stared at the flickering lines of code on her monitor.  Tonight, the entire network was down.  Not just a glitch, not just a minor outage.  The entire global network, encompassing everything from supply chain logistics to critical financial transactions, lay crippled.

The setting was the sprawling, sterile data center beneath the bustling metropolis of Neo-Tokyo.  Rows upon rows of server racks, humming with unseen energy, stretched as far as the eye could see.  A cacophony of whirring fans and clicking hard drives mingled with the rhythmic pounding of the rain on the external glass walls.  Ameliaâ€™s small, windowless office, nestled within a secure, climate-controlled section of the facility, was starkly lit.  A single, pale light shone on her face, highlighting the lines of exhaustion etched around her eyes, and the grim determination hardening her jaw.  The air hung thick with the scent of ozone and recycled air, a familiar, if unwelcome, companion to her work.  Outside, the city was bathed in the eerie, flickering glow of the rain-slicked streets.
