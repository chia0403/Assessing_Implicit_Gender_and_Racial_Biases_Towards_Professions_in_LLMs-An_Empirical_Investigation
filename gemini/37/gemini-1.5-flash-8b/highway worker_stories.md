The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of the Dakotas, stinging Amelia Blackwood's cheeks and rattling the loose gravel in the bottom of her worn-out pickup truck.  Dust devils danced in the shimmering heat haze, mimicking the swirling anxiety in her stomach.  It was a Tuesday, mid-August, the kind of day that stretched endlessly, like a stretch of Interstate 90 without a single soul in sight.  Amelia, a highway maintenance worker for the South Dakota Department of Transportation, hated Tuesdays.  They were always the worst.  This one, though, felt different.  A specific, sickening dread clung to her like the exhaust fumes from the idling diesel engine.

The setting was the vast, empty expanse of the American heartland.  Dried, cracked earth stretched as far as the eye could see, broken only by the occasional scrubby trees and the faint, almost imperceptible, scars of the interstate that snaked its way across the landscape.  Amelia's small, beat-up pickup truck, its paint faded to a muted beige, was the only visible sign of human presence against this raw, untamed backdrop. The air, thick with the scent of sage and exhaust, hung heavy and still, promising a relentlessly hot afternoon.  A lone tumbleweed, the size of a small dog, rolled lazily across the shoulder of the road, mocking the relentless monotony of the day.  This stretch of highway, between the towns of Winner and Bison, was notoriously quiet, and notoriously prone to the odd, unexplainableâ€¦occurrence.
