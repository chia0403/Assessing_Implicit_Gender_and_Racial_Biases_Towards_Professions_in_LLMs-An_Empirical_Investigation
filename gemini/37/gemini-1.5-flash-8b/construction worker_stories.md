The biting November wind whipped through the skeletal framework of the new skyscraper, whistling mournful tunes as it snaked around Elias Thorne, a seasoned construction worker with calloused hands and eyes that held the stories of countless sunrises and sunsets over countless job sites.  He hunched deeper into his thermal-lined jacket, the steel-grey concrete dust stinging his nostrils.  Below, the city sprawled out in a shimmering tapestry of lights, a million tiny diamonds reflecting the harsh glow of the streetlamps.  But here, atop the 23rd floor, the only light came from the flickering fluorescent bulbs that illuminated the construction site, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to mock the solitude.  His name, Elias Thorne, was etched into the very fabric of this towering edifice, his sweat and toil a silent testament to its rising form.

**Setting:** The 23rd floor of a skyscraper under construction in the heart of New York City.  November, a blustery, grey day.  The city lights are a stark contrast to the harsh industrial environment of the construction zone, a juxtaposition of the cityâ€™s vibrancy and the raw power of construction.
