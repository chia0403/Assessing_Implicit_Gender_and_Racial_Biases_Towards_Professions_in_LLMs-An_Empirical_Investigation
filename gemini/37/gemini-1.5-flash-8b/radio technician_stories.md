The flickering fluorescent lights of the abandoned radio repair shop cast long, skeletal shadows across Amelia "Maisie"  Jenkins's workbench.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of sunlight piercing the grime-coated window, illuminating a tangle of wires, capacitors, and half-eaten takeout containers that seemed to have become permanent fixtures.  Maisie, a radio technician with calloused hands and eyes that held the spark of a thousand forgotten broadcasts, adjusted the fine-tuning knob on a vintage shortwave receiver.  The hum of the machine, a low thrumming pulse in the otherwise silent space, was the only soundtrack to the day. The shop, once bustling with the clatter of soldering irons and the crackle of static, now echoed with a chilling emptiness.  It had been mothballed, deemed obsolete by the rising tide of digital technology.  But Maisie, clinging to the ghosts of her past, refused to let it die.  This forgotten corner of a forgotten town, nestled between the rusting husk of a factory and a creeping thicket of overgrown willow trees, held the remnants of a radio universe she was determined to unravel.  The air itself seemed to hum with the echoes of lost signals, yearning for a voice to break through the silence.
