The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the dilapidated diner, a mournful symphony that mirrored the turmoil in Amelia "Ace" Stone's gut.  She nursed a lukewarm cup of coffee, the steam doing little to dispel the chill that had settled not just in the air, but in her very bones.  Outside, the neon sign of the "Rusty Mug" flickered erratically, casting long, dancing shadows across the deserted parking lot.  This was the heart of Blackwood, a town nestled deep in the Appalachian foothills, a place where secrets clung to the air like clinging mist and whispers of the past echoed in the hollowed-out hillsides.

Ace, a private investigator with eyes that could pierce through lies like a rusty nail through wood, sat hunched over a chipped Formica table, the only other occupant being a lone, oversized tabby cat sprawled languidly on a cracked stool.  The cat, as Ace knew, was a steadfast observer, a silent partner in the silent game of solving mysteries.

The case, handed to her by a desperate-eyed woman named Eleanor Vance, was a peculiar one indeed. Her husband, a respected local businessman named Silas Vance, had vanished without a trace, leaving behind a meticulously organized life that seemed almost too perfect to be true.  The Vance home, a sprawling Victorian mansion overlooking the town, stood shrouded in an eerie quietude, like a mausoleum waiting for its next tenant.  Ace's instincts screamed of something more than a simple disappearance.  This was Blackwood, after all, and Blackwood held its secrets close, often playing cruel tricks on those foolish enough to delve into them.
