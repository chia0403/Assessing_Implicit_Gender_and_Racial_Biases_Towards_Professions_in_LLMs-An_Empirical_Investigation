The fluorescent lights of the "Everything You Need for a Perfectly Perfect Patio" store hummed, a monotonous counterpoint to the rhythmic *clink* of Amelia Hawthorne’s high heels on the polished concrete floor.  Amelia, a salesperson with an almost unnerving enthusiasm, surveyed the meticulously arranged display of outdoor furniture.  Wicker lounge sets, adorned with cushions in every imaginable shade of beige, beckoned from strategically placed pedestals.  Sun-drenched chaise longues, gleaming under the harsh store lights, promised a respite from the looming grey London skies outside.  But today, Amelia felt a peculiar chill, a disconnect from the vibrant, meticulously constructed world around her.  The perfectly manicured lawns, the flawlessly crafted barbeque grills, all seemed… hollow.  This, despite the fact that Amelia Hawthorne, sales associate extraordinaire, was, by all outward appearances, excelling.  A recent promotion to Senior Sales Associate meant more responsibility – and more meticulously crafted displays.  Her performance reviews were consistently stellar, her commission checks consistently substantial.
