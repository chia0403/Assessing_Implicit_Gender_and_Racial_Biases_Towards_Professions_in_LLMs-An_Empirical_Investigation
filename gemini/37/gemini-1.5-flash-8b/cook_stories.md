The air in the "Rusty Spoon" hung thick with the scent of rosemary, garlic, and something faintly metallic, a smell that clung to the old brick walls like a persistent ghost.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic pace of  Aurelia "Auri"  Delacroix.  Auri, a cook with hands perpetually stained a rich, paprika-red, sliced through the bubbling stew, her movements precise and practiced despite the frantic rhythm of the kitchen.  The small restaurant, tucked away on a side street in the rain-slicked town of Ashwood, was always busiest during the autumnal downpours.  Tonight, however, the din was amplified by a palpable tension, a feeling Auri understood all too well. The aroma of the stew, a hearty mix of venison, wild mushrooms, and a secret blend of spices Auri guarded fiercely, usually soothed the anxieties of Ashwood's residents. Tonight, however, it seemed only to exacerbate them.
