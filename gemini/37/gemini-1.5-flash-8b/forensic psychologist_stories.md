Rain lashed against the arched windows of the abandoned Victorian manor, mirroring the storm brewing within Dr. Eleanor Vance's mind.  The air hung thick with the scent of mildew and something else, something acrid and unsettling, like burnt sugar and fear.  She adjusted the collar of her waterproof coat, the dampness clinging to her like a second skin.  Outside, the gnarled branches of ancient oaks clawed at the sky, their skeletal fingers reaching out as if to pull the house itself into the tempest.  This was Blackwood Manor, a place steeped in whispers and shadows, a place where history had gone sour and the past refused to stay buried.  Eleanor Vance, forensic psychologist, had come to unravel the mysteries buried within its crumbling walls.

The manor, a sprawling edifice of dark, aged wood and decaying stone, stood isolated on a windswept hill overlooking a sprawling valley.  Gloomy mist perpetually swirled around its foundations, clinging to the decaying ivy that choked the crumbling facade.  Inside, the once-grand interiors were a ruin of shattered grandeur, furniture splintered and draped with cobwebs, dust motes dancing in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom.  The house seemed to breathe, its creaking timbers groaning under the pressure of the relentless storm.  A chilling silence, punctuated only by the rhythmic patter of the rain and the mournful sigh of the wind, pervaded the air, a silence that pressed down on Eleanor like a suffocating blanket.
