The flickering neon sign of "Ace Plumbing" cast a sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked alley.  Water, a relentless, persistent enemy, seeped through the cracked pavement, mirroring the constant drip, drip, drip that plagued the life of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, licensed plumber and resident of the perpetually damp, perpetually frustrating, Lower East Side.  Barty, a man whose perpetually stained overalls seemed to absorb the city's grime rather than repel it, stared into the murky depths of the overflowing manhole cover.  This particular plumbing nightmare, he knew, was going to be a long one. The aroma of something vaguely floral and distinctly unpleasant hung heavy in the air, a scent that Barty recognized as a certain kind of sewage-borne fungus, a particular bane of his trade. He grumbled, adjusting the heavy leather work gloves that seemed permanently affixed to his hands, and took a deep breath, bracing himself for the inevitable hours of struggle and the inevitable smell-inducing tasks that lay ahead.
