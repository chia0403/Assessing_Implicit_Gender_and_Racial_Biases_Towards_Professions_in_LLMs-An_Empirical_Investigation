The chipped paint on the wall, a faded shade of lavender, seemed to sigh with the afternoon humidity.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight slicing through the grimy window of the "Little Lambs" daycare.  Inside, Amelia Grace Hawthorne, a young woman with eyes the colour of melted chocolate and hair like spun gold, knelt beside a small, tearful child named Leo.  Leo, all tangled limbs and frustrated whimpers, was attempting to wrestle a colourful construction truck into a box that was clearly too small.

The setting:  a cramped, but cheerfully painted, community daycare center in the heart of a vibrant, yet impoverished, neighbourhood.  The air hung thick with the smell of crayons, baby powder, and a faint, persistent aroma of something vaguely resembling burnt toast.  Rows of colourful plastic toys lined shelves that groaned under the weight of decades of toddler-induced chaos.  A worn, floral-patterned rug muffled the soft thud of tiny feet navigating the brightly coloured floor.  A constantly blaring radio played children's music, a relentless soundtrack to the daily drama and joy unfolding within these walls.
