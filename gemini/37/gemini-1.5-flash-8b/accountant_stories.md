The fluorescent lights of the "Numbers & Nuggets" accounting firm hummed, a relentless, almost sinister, soundtrack to Amelia Butterfield's afternoon.  Paperwork, mountains of it, piled higher than the perpetually overflowing coffee pot.  Amelia, a seasoned accountant with a penchant for meticulously organized chaos, stared at a spreadsheet titled "Project Chimera: Quarterly Profit Projections," her brow furrowed.  The numbers danced on the screen, a maddening jig of potential profit and lurking losses.  The year was 2042.  The city, Neo-Veridian, sprawled beneath a perpetual twilight sky, a shimmering mosaic of interconnected, iridescent skyscrapers that seemed to breathe with their own internal light.  Ameliaâ€™s office, a small, but surprisingly comfortable, cubicle nestled within a sprawling, glass-fronted tower, offered a bird's eye view of the city's vibrant, yet unsettlingly efficient, urban sprawl.  The aroma of recycled coffee and the faint but persistent scent of ozone hung heavy in the air, a constant reminder of the city's technological heartbeat.
