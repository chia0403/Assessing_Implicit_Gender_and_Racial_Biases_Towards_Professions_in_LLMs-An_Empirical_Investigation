The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Nutri-Boost" storefront cast a sickly yellow glow on Amelia Hawthorne, Nutritionist.  Rain lashed against the glass, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  The scent of stale coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air, a tangible miasma clinging to the chipped Formica counter and the rows of meticulously arranged, but ultimately uninspiring, jars of protein powder.  Amelia, a woman whose sculpted physique and sharp, intelligent eyes belied the exhaustion etched into her tired face, stared at the overflowing bin of returned meal prep containers.  Each one, a silent testament to a client's failed attempt at healthier habits.  She ran a hand through her already-dishevelled dark brown hair, the tension a knot in her stomach.  Outside, the city roared, oblivious to the quiet struggle within the small, almost invisible, storefront.  The year was 2042.  Food scarcity was a growing problem, particularly in urban centres, and nutritionists like Amelia were increasingly stretched to their limits.
