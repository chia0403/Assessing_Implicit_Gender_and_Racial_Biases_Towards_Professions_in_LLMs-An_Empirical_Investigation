The fluorescent lights of Dr. Aris Thorne's dental office hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *click-clack* of his drill.  Outside, the city of Aethelgard, nestled in the foothills of the Whispering Mountains, thrummed with a life Aris rarely felt connected to.  The air, thick with the scent of pine and exhaust fumes, hung heavy in the sterile waiting room, punctuated only by the occasional whimper of a child or the hushed murmur of an anxious adult.  Aris, a man built of quiet intensity and a lifetime spent meticulously crafting smiles, felt the familiar knot tighten in his stomach.  Today was different. Today, it wasn't just cavities he was worried about.

Setting:

Aethelgard, a sprawling metropolis nestled within the shadow of the Whispering Mountains, was a city of contradictions.  Ancient, winding cobblestone streets snaked around towering modern skyscrapers, the air perpetually a mix of the crisp mountain air and the exhaust fumes of a growing population.  The city's reputation rested on its gleaming, state-of-the-art medical facilities, juxtaposed with its secretive, whispered history.  Hidden in the heart of the city, Dr. Thorne's practice, "Aethelgard Smiles," was a testament to both the city's modern advancements and its deeply ingrained history of oral health care.
