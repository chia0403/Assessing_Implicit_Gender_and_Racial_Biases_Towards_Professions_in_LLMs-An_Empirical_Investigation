The flickering fluorescent lights of the Occupational Therapy wing hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic clinking of metal on metal.  Rain lashed against the oversized windows of St. Jude's Rehabilitation Center, blurring the already muted colours of the winter landscape outside.  Inside, Amelia Grace Hawthorne, a seasoned occupational therapist with a deceptively calm demeanor and eyes that held the weight of countless patient stories, meticulously assessed a patient's grip strength.  Her tailored grey scrubs, usually a symbol of efficiency and order, felt damp against her skin, mirroring the pervasive chill in the air.  Today, however, the dampness held a different quality; it was a tangible tension, a premonition of the storm brewing not just outside, but also within the hallowed halls of the rehabilitation center.
