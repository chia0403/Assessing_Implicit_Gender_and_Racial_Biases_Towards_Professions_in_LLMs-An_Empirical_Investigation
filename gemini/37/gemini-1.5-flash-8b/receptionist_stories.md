The chipped Formica countertop gleamed under the fluorescent lights of the "Apex Architectural Designs" reception area, reflecting the nervous flutter in Amelia Hawthorne's stomach.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun, filtering through the grimy windowpane overlooking a construction site, its chaotic symphony of hammering and shouting a stark contrast to the hushed, almost sepulchral, atmosphere of the office.  Amelia, with her perpetually messy auburn hair and a weariness etched into her prematurely lined face, felt like a small, insignificant pebble in the churning tide of deadlines and demanding clients.  Her nameplate, chipped and slightly askew, proclaimed her title: Receptionist.  The office, a relic of the 1980s, held a peculiar charm, a silent testament to a bygone era of bespoke designs and intricate blueprints.  A half-eaten bag of stale pretzels lay abandoned on a stack of architectural renderings, a poignant metaphor for the projects that never quite made it out of the conceptual phase.
