The biting wind, a relentless rasp against Silas Blackwood's face, whipped snow into swirling, blinding eddies.  The timberline, a jagged, skeletal ridge against the bruised twilight sky, seemed to mock him.  Silas, his weathered hands calloused and cracked, wrestled with the heavy winch, the groaning metal a discordant counterpoint to the howling wind.  He was at the very edge of the Whispering Pines, a remote, unforgiving stretch of the Appalachian Mountains where the forest claimed the land like a hungry beast.  The air, thick with the scent of pine needles and damp earth, held a chilling silence punctuated only by the groan of the old-growth trees and the rhythmic clank of the winch.

Silas Blackwood, a logger of the old school, moved with the deliberate grace of a mountain lion, his movements as sure and steady as the ancient trees he felled.  He'd been alone in the Whispering Pines for two weeks, lost in a world of gnarled branches, towering evergreens, and the rhythmic pulse of the axe.  His cabin, a small, weather-beaten structure clinging to the mountainside, was his only company, its meager firelight painting dancing shadows on the rough-hewn walls.  He was on a seemingly impossible mission:  to find a lost stand of white pines, whispered about in hushed tones by the other loggers, rumored to hold a secret, a legendary treasure.
