The village of Oakhaven, nestled amongst the whispering pines, was shrouded in a blanket of early winter, a stark contrast to the vibrant tapestry of life Elias remembered from his youth.  His workshop, a small, cramped space tucked behind the village's cobbled market square, was his sanctuary, his prison, and his only solace.
