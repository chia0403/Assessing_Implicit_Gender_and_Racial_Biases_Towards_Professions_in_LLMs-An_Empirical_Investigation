The biting wind whipped at Amelia "Amy" Blackwood's flight suit, stinging her cheeks and rattling the already strained rivets of the "Sky Serpent."  Below, the jagged peaks of the Veridian Mountains pierced the bruised twilight sky, casting long, skeletal shadows that danced with the swirling mist.  Amy, her knuckles white around the controls, wrestled with the unruly beast of a plane, a vintage experimental craft patched together from salvaged parts and powered by a sputtering, antique engine.  The Sky Serpent, her pride and her curse, was threatening to buck and break free from her grasp.

The year was 2077.  The world, fractured by a catastrophic climate shift a century prior, had retreated into fortified enclaves and scattered settlements clinging precariously to the few remaining habitable zones.  The Veridian Mountains, a once-celebrated pilgrimage site, now stood as a desolate border, a treacherous divide between the remnants of the prosperous Aerotech civilization and the fragmented, struggling societies beyond.  Amy, a pilot with the Zephyr Reconnaissance Squad, was tasked with a perilous survey flight, her small plane the only beacon of hope in the impending storm.  Her mission: to discover if the ancient air currents, which were once vital for trans-continental travel, could be re-activated.  Only then might a path toward reconnection be possible.
