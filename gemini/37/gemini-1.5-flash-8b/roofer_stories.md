The biting wind whipped at Silas Blackwood's weathered face, stinging his eyes and tugging at the frayed edges of his wool cap.  He clung to the precarious wooden plank, the only connection between him and the shuddering slate roof of the sprawling Blackwood Manor.  Rain, relentless and icy, hammered against the warped shingles, a ceaseless drumbeat against the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks surrounding the estate.  The manor itself, a gothic monstrosity of grey stone and towering turrets, loomed above, its many windows like vacant eyes staring out into the turbulent November sky.  Silas, despite his decades of experience on rooftops, felt a shiver of unease run down his spine. This job, this seemingly simple repair, felt different.  A weight heavier than the slates pressed down on his chest.


The setting: Blackwood Manor, a decaying, imposing gothic estate perched atop a windswept hill overlooking a valley shrouded in mist.  The year is 1892.  The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and pine needles, punctuated by the sharp tang of salt from the nearby sea. The manor, once a symbol of prosperity, now felt more like a monument to neglect.  Its many rooms, once filled with laughter and music, echoed only with the whispering wind.
