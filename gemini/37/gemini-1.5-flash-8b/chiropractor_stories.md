The fluorescent lights of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office hummed, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *click-clack* of her heels against the linoleum floor.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun slicing through the grimy windowpanes of the small, unassuming building on Elm Street.  Eleanor, a chiropractor with a practiced calm, adjusted the posture of a patient, her hands firm and precise on the man's neck.  Outside, the city roared â€“ a symphony of sirens and honking taxis, a relentless soundtrack to the quiet lives unfolding within the four walls of her practice.  Eleanor knew the music well; the ache in a patient's back often mirrored the anxieties and pressures of the urban landscape outside.  Today, a new patient, a nervous young woman named  Amelia, was her latest melody.
