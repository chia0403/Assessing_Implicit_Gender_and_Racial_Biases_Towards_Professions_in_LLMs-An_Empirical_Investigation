Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the Willow Creek Nursing Home, a rhythmic tattoo that echoed the frantic beat of Amelia Blackwood's heart.  The air, thick with the scent of antiseptic and damp earth, clung to her like a second skin.  Willow Creek, nestled in the valley between the whispering pines and the jagged peaks of the Razorbacks, was a place of quiet desperation, a tapestry woven with the frail threads of elderly lives and the weary resilience of nurses like Amelia.

The fluorescent lights of the nurses' station hummed, a monotonous counterpoint to the soft snoring and occasional, rattling coughs emanating from the hallways.  Amelia, a registered nurse with ten years' experience, felt a knot of anxiety tighten in her stomach.  This particular shift held a unique blend of urgency and quiet dread, a premonition that something was amiss.  She stared at the digital clock, its cold numbers mocking her: 2:17 AM.  Another night, another watchful vigil.
