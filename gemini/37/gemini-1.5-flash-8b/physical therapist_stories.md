The flickering fluorescent lights of the rehab gym hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *thump-thump* of Amelia Hayes's own heart.  Sweat beaded on her brow, not from the exertion of her own workout, but from the anxious anticipation that coiled around her like a pre-exercise warm-up.  Today was the day.  The day she'd assess Leo.

Setting:  The brightly-lit, yet sterile, physical therapy gym of "Rehab R Us" was a stark contrast to the dimly-lit, cozy apartment Leo, a 72-year-old retiree who lived a quiet and solitary life, inhabited.  The rhythmic clang of metal on metal and the occasional groan of strained muscles filled the air, while the muted cries of frustrated patients mingled with the hushed tones of other therapists. Outside, the city buzzed with life, oblivious to the quiet drama unfolding within the small but meticulously maintained space.  The stark white walls, punctuated by brightly colored exercise equipment, mirrored the clean lines of Amelia's own professional persona.  But today, a layer of tension draped over everything, thicker than the morning's damp air.
