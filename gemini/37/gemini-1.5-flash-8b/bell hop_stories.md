The brass bell, a mocking jangle against the hushed grandeur of the Grand Imperial Hotel, announced the arrival of a particularly damp evening.  Rain lashed against the ornate facade of the hotel, mirroring the tempest brewing in the heart of  Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, bellhop extraordinaire.  Barty, a young man with a mop of unruly brown hair and eyes the colour of polished mahogany, felt the familiar knot of anxiety tighten in his stomach.  Tonight, a particularly demanding and renowned theatre critic,  Mr. Percival Featherstonehaugh, was due to check in.

The Grand Imperial, a towering monument of Victorian opulence, stood sentinel over the cobbled streets of Foghaven.  Gas lamps flickered precariously, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to mock the perpetual drizzle.  The scent of coal smoke, mingled with the aroma of freshly baked bread from a nearby bakery, hung heavy in the air.  Inside the hotel, the grand lobby hummed with a hushed energy, a symphony of hushed whispers and the rhythmic clinking of silverware.  The polished mahogany floors, gleaming beneath the flickering gaslight, reflected the strained smiles of the hotel staff, a collective expression of simmering anticipation for the arrival of the critical Featherstonehaugh.  Barty, however, felt his insides churning like a restless sea.  He'd mislaid a priceless antique teacup earlier that day, a near-fatal offense in the meticulously ordered world of the Grand Imperial.
