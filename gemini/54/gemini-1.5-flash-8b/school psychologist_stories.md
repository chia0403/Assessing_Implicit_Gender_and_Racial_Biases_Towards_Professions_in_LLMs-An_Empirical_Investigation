The fluorescent lights of the Northwood High School counselling office hummed, a monotonous counterpoint to the rhythmic thump-thump of Amelia Blackwood's heart.  Amelia, a school psychologist with a decade of experience navigating the labyrinthine emotional landscapes of adolescence, felt a familiar knot tightening in her chest.  Today, the knot was particularly vicious.  Thirteen-year-old Leo Chen, a quiet boy with eyes the colour of storm clouds, sat slumped in the worn leather chair, his silence a palpable weight in the small room.

Setting:  The counselling office was a stark contrast to the vibrant chaos of the high school hallways.  Pale beige walls, lined with framed posters about stress management and healthy coping mechanisms, offered little solace.  A lone potted fern, wilting slightly, sat on the corner of the desk, a silent testament to the often neglected need for nurturing amidst the storm.  Sunlight, fractured by the grime-covered windowpanes, illuminated dust motes dancing in the air.  The smell of old textbooks and despair hung heavy in the air.  Outside, the sounds of teenagers chattering and laughing spilled into the room, a constant reminder of the world Leo Chen had chosen to shut out.
