The chipped Formica countertop gleamed under the harsh fluorescent lights of the "Accountant's Anonymous" office, reflecting Amelia Peabody's meticulously organized stack of invoices.  Each paper, a miniature universe of numbers and dates, demanded her attention, her fingers dancing across the keys of her ancient, but loyal, IBM Selectric typewriter.  The year was 1984.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and the hushed, almost reverent, whispers of financial transactions.  Amelia, a bookkeeper for the perpetually struggling, yet somehow eternally optimistic, "Sunrise Bakery," found solace in the rhythmic click-clack of her typewriter, a sanctuary from the cacophony of the outside world.  The tiny, cramped office, tucked away on the second floor of a building that had likely seen better days, was a world unto itself, a quiet island in a bustling city.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight piercing the gloom, illuminating a chipped mug of lukewarm coffee and a lonely, wilting potted fern.
