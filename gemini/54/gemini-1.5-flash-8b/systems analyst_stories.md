The fluorescent hum of the server room was Elias Thorne's constant companion.  He'd known it, this rhythmic thrumming, for the better part of a decade.  Elias Thorne, Systems Analyst at GlobalTech Solutions, wasn't a man who craved the symphony of a bustling office or the vibrant chatter of a conference room.  He preferred the quiet hum, the ordered precision of the rows of gleaming servers, each a silent cog in the intricate machine that powered GlobalTech's ubiquitous cloud services.  Tonight, however, the hum was different.  It was a high-pitched whine, a strangled cry of overloaded circuits, and the indicator lights on the servers pulsed with an unnerving, frantic rhythm.  The air, usually dry and sterile, was thick with a metallic tang.

The setting: GlobalTech's subterranean data center.  Miles below the shimmering cityscape, in a cavernous space carved from the earth, a constellation of glowing rectangles illuminated the room.  Rows upon rows of servers, linked by a labyrinth of fibre optic cables, stretched as far as the eye could see.  The sterile white walls, reflecting the eerie glow, seemed to absorb the faint tremor that pulsed through the floor, a tremor that echoed the growing unease in Elias's chest.  A faint but persistent scent of ozone hung heavy in the air, an unwelcome guest in the normally pristine environment.  Elias, clad in his customary grey uniform, felt the prickle of apprehension crawl up his spine. He knew this feeling.  This feeling meant something was seriously wrong.
