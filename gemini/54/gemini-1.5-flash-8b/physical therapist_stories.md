The fluorescent hum of the physical therapy clinic, a monotonous drone punctuated by the rhythmic *thump-thump* of Amelia Harding's own heart, was a soundtrack to her life.  Amelia Harding, a physical therapist with a deceptively calm demeanor and eyes that held the weight of countless stories, stared at the faded floral wallpaper of the waiting room.  Each tiny, faded rose seemed to mock the vibrancy she felt lacking in her own existence.  It had been three months since the accident.  Three months since she'd witnessed the jagged, shattered remains of what had been a vibrant life, a life of exhilarating physical activity and passion-filled pursuits. Now, her days were filled with the quiet grind of rebuilding.  Rebuilding not just limbs, but spirits.  And in a way, she was rebuilding herself, too.

The clinic, nestled in a quiet corner of the bustling city, was a relic of a bygone era.  Its aged, creaky wooden floors whispered tales of countless patients who'd walked those very tiles, each step holding a personal narrative of pain, resilience, and slow, painstaking recovery.  Sunlight, filtered through grimy windows, cast long shadows across the room, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air.  The air itself held the faint scent of antiseptic and stale coffee, a familiar, comforting aroma.  Outside, the rhythmic clang of metal on metal from a nearby construction site offered a stark contrast to the gentle sighs of the patients within.
