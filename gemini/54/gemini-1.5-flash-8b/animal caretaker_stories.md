The biting wind whipped across the moors, stinging Elara Blackwood's cheeks as she adjusted the thick wool scarf around her neck.  The skeletal remains of a long-dead oak, its gnarled branches reaching like skeletal fingers towards a bruised, pewter sky, marked the entrance to the Blackwood Manor wildlife sanctuary.  Founded by her eccentric, now-deceased grandfather, the sanctuary was a haven for creatures deemed 'unsuitable' â€“ the perpetually melancholy barn owls with their haunting cries, the skittish pygmy hippos with their surprisingly deep rumbles, and the perpetually bewildered, almost sentient, hedgehogs that seemed to stare with unnerving intelligence.  Elara, at 27, was the animal caretaker, inheriting not only the responsibility but also the strange, almost unsettling quietude of the place.  The howling wind seemed to echo the hollow ache in her chest, a feeling as familiar as the rustle of the ancient, whispering willows that lined the long, winding path leading to the sanctuary's heart.
