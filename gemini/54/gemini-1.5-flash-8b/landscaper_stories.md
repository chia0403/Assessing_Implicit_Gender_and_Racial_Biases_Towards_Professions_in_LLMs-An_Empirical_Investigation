The wind, a restless spirit, whipped through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks bordering Blackwood Manor, tugging at Amelia Hawthorne's worn gardening hat.  Dust devils danced across the manicured lawns, swirling the fallen leaves into miniature tornadoes.  Amelia, her brow furrowed in concentration, adjusted the nozzle of her sprayer, aiming a fine mist at the struggling hydrangeas.  September in Blackwood was a cruel mistress, the relentless sun fading, the nights growing chill, but the gardens, entrusted to her care, demanded perfection, even in their quiet surrender to autumn.

Blackwood Manor, a brooding edifice of grey stone and shadowed eaves, loomed over the estate.  Its vast grounds, once vibrant with colour and life, were now a tapestry of muted hues. The air, thick with the scent of decaying leaves and damp earth, carried with it a whisper of secrets, a history as intricate and winding as the stone paths that crisscrossed the property.  Amelia, a landscaper for over a decade, had learned to hear those whispers, to discern the silent stories etched in the very soil beneath her calloused feet.  This was her fourth autumn tending to the Manor's gardens, and each year felt as if it were carrying a heavier load of unspoken tales.
