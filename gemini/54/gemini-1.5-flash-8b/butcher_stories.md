The aroma, a potent symphony of blood and brine, hung heavy in the air of the cobbled alley.  Rain, slick and relentless, hammered against the corrugated tin roof of Bartholomew "Barty" Grimshaw's butcher shop, a meagre shelter nestled between a baker's stall perpetually choked with flour dust and a sputtering, coal-fired blacksmith's forge.  Barty, a man whose hands, weathered and stained a deep, earthy crimson, were calloused but undeniably strong, knelt beside a butcher's block, his gaze fixed on a magnificent, still-bleeding ox carcass.  The animal had been felled early this morning, its last breath mingling with the cries of gulls circling the refuse-strewn rooftops.  Now, bathed in the flickering candlelight that illuminated the narrow space, the beast lay in all its monumental glory, a testament to the hard, unyielding rhythms of life and death that governed this grimy corner of the city.  The city, a tapestry woven from smoke-choked streets, overflowing markets, and the echoing cries of hawkers.
