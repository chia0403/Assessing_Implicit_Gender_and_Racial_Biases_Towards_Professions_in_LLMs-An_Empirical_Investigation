The biting wind, a relentless, icy rasp, whipped across the exposed hillside.  Dust, fine and gritty, stung Elara Stonehand's eyes as she chipped away at the stubborn granite.  Sunlight, weak and filtered through a bruised grey sky, cast long, skeletal shadows that danced across the scarred face of the mountain.  This was the Quarry of the Serpent's Tooth, a place where the earth groaned and whispered tales of forgotten gods and even more forgotten wars.  Elara, a stone cutter renowned for her precision and strength, worked alone, her only companions the rhythmic clang of her hammer and the mournful cry of the wind.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and the faint, metallic tang of weathered stone, was her constant companion.


Her full name was Elara Stonehand, daughter of the late Master Carver, a name whispered with reverence in the nearby village of Oakhaven, though Elara herself felt no particular reverence for the title.  She was simply a stone cutter, a craftsman of the earth, and the mountains were her workshop.
