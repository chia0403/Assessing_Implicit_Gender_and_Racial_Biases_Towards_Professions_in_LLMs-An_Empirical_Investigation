Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the "Dusty Rose" detective agency, mirroring the turmoil churning inside Amelia "Ash" Ashworth.  The flickering neon sign outside cast a lurid glow on the city's sprawling urban sprawl, a cityscape of towering steel and flickering alleyways that seemed to whisper secrets in the downpour.  1948.  The air hung thick with the smell of damp asphalt and cheap cigarettes, a familiar comfort and constant companion in the seedy heart of New York City.  Amelia, a private investigator with eyes the color of stormy seas and a reputation as sharp as a freshly-honed blade, stared at the crumpled telegram clutched in her hand.  It was from a client she'd only met once, a Mr.  Fitzwilliam.  He'd requested her services, simply stating, "A matter of life and death."  The telegram, barely legible beneath the swirling ink, concluded with a single, chilling detail:  "The emerald necklace."


The Dusty Rose, tucked away on a rain-slicked side street, was more of a dimly lit alcove than a proper office.  Dust motes danced in the single, flickering bulb above Amelia's cluttered desk.  A worn leather armchair, the only other piece of furniture worthy of the name, sat opposite a chaotic array of case files, photographs, and half-eaten sandwiches.  A single, overflowing ashtray spoke volumes about the agency's clientele.  Beyond the peeling wallpaper and the omnipresent smell of stale coffee, the city's clamorous heartbeat pulsed through the thin walls.  Amelia knew this city.  She knew its secrets, its shadows, and the whispers carried on the wind.  She was a creature of the night, a hunter of truths buried beneath layers of deceit. Now, the Emerald Necklace had to be recovered.
