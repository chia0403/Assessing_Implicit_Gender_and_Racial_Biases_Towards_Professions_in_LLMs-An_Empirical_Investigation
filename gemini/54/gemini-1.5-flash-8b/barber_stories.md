The chipped porcelain sink, stained a faded ochre from years of lukewarm water and the inevitable errant drips, reflected the flickering gaslight hanging precariously from the ceiling of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's barbershop.  Dust motes danced in the single beam of light, illuminating a chaotic symphony of combs, clippers, and faded posters advertising the latest concoctions for a man's hair â€“ remedies Barty himself often found rather dubious.  The air, thick with the scent of sandalwood soap and something vaguely metallic, clung to the worn leather armchairs.  The year was 1888.  The city of Grimsby, nestled between the relentless grey of the North Sea and the ever-present smoke of the industrial heartland, hummed with a muted, restless energy.  Barty, perched on a stool in the back, watched the steam curl from his copper kettle, a small, anxious tremor in his hand.  Tonight, a storm threatened, a tempest of wind and rain that promised to batter the cobbled streets and rattle the already strained nerves of Grimsby's inhabitants.  He knew, instinctively, that something was different tonight.
