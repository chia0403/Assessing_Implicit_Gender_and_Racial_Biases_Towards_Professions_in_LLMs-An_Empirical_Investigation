The pre-dawn chill snagged at Elias Blackwood's exposed skin, a constant reminder that November in the Colorado Rockies wasn't a time for sentimentality.  He hunched deeper into his worn, waterproof jacket, the collar pulled high around his neck, as he surveyed the patchwork of asphalt and gravel that was Highway 550.  The faintest hints of sunrise, bruised lavender and rose, were just beginning to paint the peaks of the Collegiate Range a blush, but the air still held the bite of a mountain winter, promising more snow by nightfall.  Elias, a highway maintenance worker for the Colorado Department of Transportation, was already on his rounds, the rhythmic thump of his boots against the compacted gravel the only sound that disturbed the silent grandeur of the mountain landscape.  His weathered hands, calloused from years of wrestling with rock and steel, gripped the handle of his utility tool belt, a metal cradle full of his indispensable tools: shovels, pickaxes, and the ever-present, worn trowel that had been his loyal companion for nearly two decades.  This stretch of the highway, a treacherous ribbon winding through a valley scarred by the recent mudslide, was his responsibility.  He knew the rhythm of the mountain's moods better than the beat of his own heart.
