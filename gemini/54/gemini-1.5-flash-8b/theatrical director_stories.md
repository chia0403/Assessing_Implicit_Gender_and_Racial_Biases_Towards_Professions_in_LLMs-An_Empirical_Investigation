The flickering gaslight cast long, theatrical shadows across the cramped rehearsal hall, highlighting the dust motes dancing in the air.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless counterpoint to the hushed whispers and the rhythmic thump of Anya Petrovaâ€™s heavy boots on the worn wooden floor.  Anya Petrova, director of the perpetually underfunded and perpetually passionate "Thespian Troupe of the Thistle," surveyed her cast.  Five actors, each more invested in their own egos than the play itself, stood frozen mid-pose.  Tonight was the dress rehearsal for "The Misadventures of a Misunderstood Marquess," a farcical romp through the Gilded Age that Anya hoped, against all odds, would finally garner the troupe some recognition, and perhaps, a decent paying gig beyond the local charity events. The air, thick with the scent of cheap coffee and desperation, was the very essence of late-Victorian London. The year was 1898.  Cobblestone streets, lined with gas lamps casting long, dancing shadows, were just visible through the grime-laden windows. The fog hung heavy in the air, clinging to the ancient brick buildings and shrouding the city in an ethereal, almost spectral quality. Each actor seemed to have their own little drama playing out.  The lead, a rather portly gentleman named Bartholomew Crumbly, adjusted his magnificent but ill-fitting moustache.  Across from him, a wisp of a woman named Esme Nightingale paced, tapping her foot impatiently.
