The antiseptic tang of chlorhexidine hung heavy in the air, a familiar, almost comforting scent to Dr. Eleanor Vance.  Sunlight, fractured by the intricate patterns of the stained-glass windows, cast long, shifting shadows across the meticulously organized dental chairs in her practice, "Vance Smiles."  It was a Tuesday morning, and the usual Tuesday rhythm of drills whirring, conversations hushed, and the rhythmic *click-clack* of instruments was already in full swing.  Eleanor, her name discreetly embroidered on her crisp white lab coat, surveyed the waiting room.  The muted buzz of conversation, punctuated by the occasional cough, was a symphony of quiet anticipation.  A particularly vibrant splash of yellow in the otherwise muted tones of the waiting room caught her eye: a young woman, her smile shy, nervously twisting a strand of auburn hair around her finger.

**Setting:** Vance Smiles, a dental practice tucked away on a quiet side street in the heart of a historic district of Charleston, South Carolina.  The practice, with its stained glass windows and antique dental cabinets, radiated a timeless elegance.  The historic architecture of the neighborhood, with its antebellum homes and cobblestone streets, framed the practice like a beautiful, if slightly worn, backdrop.
