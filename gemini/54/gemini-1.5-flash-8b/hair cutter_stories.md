The chipped paint of the "Snip-Snap Scissors" sign, a faded emerald green, barely clung to the weathered wood above the door.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of rosemary and something vaguely metallic, like old pennies.  This was Amelia Blackwood's domain, a tiny, cluttered salon tucked away on a cobbled side street in the heart of the decaying, yet strangely vibrant, city of Aethelgard.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom of the narrow shop. Amelia, a woman whose sharp angles were softened by the warm, honey-brown curls that framed her face, was meticulously snipping a strand of auburn hair, the rhythmic click of the shears a counterpoint to the distant clanging of the city's many bells.  Outside, the wind howled, rattling the ancient windows, as if trying to coax some of the city's secrets out of the shop.  Amelia, however, was lost in the intricate patterns she was weaving into the woman's hair, her concentration absolute.  Her reputation, and the small, loyal clientele that kept her salon afloat, depended on it.
