The biting November wind whipped Amelia Dubois's auburn hair across her face as she surveyed the dilapidated Victorian.  Rain, the consistency of a fine, icy mist, beaded on the peeling paint of the front porch, mirroring the damp chill settling in Amelia's bones.  She squinted against the gloom, the overcast sky a bruised purple reflecting the melancholy of the property itself.  The house, nestled at the edge of the otherwise vibrant, bustling Elmwood district, seemed to whisper tales of forgotten grandeur, its once-proud façade now a testament to neglect and time’s relentless hand.  This was 173 Maple Street, and it was Amelia's latest challenge.

**Setting:** Elmwood, a once-thriving district of a small, northeastern American city, now experiencing a period of gentrification.  Luxury condos and sleek apartments were sprouting up, while older, more characterful homes like 173 Maple were slowly being reclaimed.  A pervasive sense of change hung heavy in the air.  The city buzzed with the energy of the upcoming holiday season, while the shadowed corners of Elmwood held their breath, waiting to see which homes would be swept into the new wave of progress, and which would resist.
