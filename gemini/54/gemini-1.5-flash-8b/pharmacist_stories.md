The fluorescent hum of the pharmacy, a low, persistent drone, vibrated through Amelia Nightingale's bones.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grime-coated windowpanes, illuminating a cloud of antiseptic aroma that hung heavy in the air.  Apothecary Nightingale, as the faded sign outside proclaimed, was a relic of a bygone era, a quaint, almost forgotten, corner of the city tucked away behind a towering apartment block.  Amelia, her name echoing the quiet dignity of her profession, was more accustomed to the hushed whispers of ingredients than the clamor of modern life.  Her fingers, calloused from years of handling vials and powders, moved with practiced ease, meticulously measuring out a precise dose of Valerian root extract.  A small, nervous woman with bright, anxious eyes, stood before her counter, clutching a worn leather wallet.  Amelia knew this anxious look, recognized the silent plea behind the hesitant questions.  This was just another day in the life of a pharmacist in a city that was never truly quiet, even in the fading light.
