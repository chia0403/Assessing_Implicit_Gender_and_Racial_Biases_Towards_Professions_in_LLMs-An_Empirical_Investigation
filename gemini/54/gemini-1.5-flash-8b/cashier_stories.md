The fluorescent lights of the "Everyday Essentials" store hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia Butterfield's life.  Dust motes danced in the pale glow, reflecting off the chipped Formica countertops and the meticulously organized rows of toiletries and cleaning supplies.  Amelia, a twenty-four-year-old with perpetually tired eyes and a perpetually stained apron, scanned another jar of pickles.  The plastic lid clicked shut, a sharp counterpoint to the muffled conversations echoing from the aisles.  Outside, the grey November sky mirrored the dreary mood of the store, a stark contrast to the vibrant, almost gaudy, packaging surrounding her. Today, the only color Amelia saw was the sickly yellow of the expired coupons stacked haphazardly on the counter. The store's air conditioning, a relentless machine, fought a losing battle against the damp chill seeping in from the leaky window above the cosmetics section.  It was a Tuesday, the kind of Tuesday where the only excitement was the promise of another Wednesday.
