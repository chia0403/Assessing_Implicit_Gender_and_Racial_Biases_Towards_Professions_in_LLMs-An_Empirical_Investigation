Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of "The Healing Hand," a small, unassuming massage therapy clinic tucked away on a side street in the gritty heart of Manchester.  The scent of damp earth and something vaguely floral, clinging to the air, mingled with the faint, comforting aroma of lavender oil.

The rhythmic hum of the ventilation system was the only sound besides the rhythmic pulse of her hands against the woman's back. Amelia had been in this small, slightly cramped room for five years, and in her quiet sanctuary, she found a strange kind of peace.  But tonight, a different kind of energy thrummed in the air, a tangible current that threatened to unravel her carefully constructed tranquility.
