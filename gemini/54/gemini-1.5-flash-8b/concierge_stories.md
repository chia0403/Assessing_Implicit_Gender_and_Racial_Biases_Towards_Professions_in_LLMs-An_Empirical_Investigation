The Parisian air, thick with the scent of jasmine and impending rain, hung heavy in the foyer of the Hôtel de la Lune.  A single, flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the polished parquet floor, highlighting dust motes swirling in the gloom.  Elodie Dubois, the Hôtel de la Lune's concierge, stood sentinel at the grand, mahogany desk, her gloved hands resting lightly on the intricate carvings.  A half-eaten croissant, its edges crisp and golden, sat forgotten on the blotter beside a stack of impeccably folded letters.  Rain hammered against the ancient leaded windows, a relentless percussion against the hushed stillness of the hotel.  The only sounds were the rhythmic drip, drip, drip of water from a leaky pipe somewhere in the unseen depths of the building and the soft, almost imperceptible, sigh of Elodie's breath.  Tonight, the hotel held its breath, too, anticipating the storm's arrival.
