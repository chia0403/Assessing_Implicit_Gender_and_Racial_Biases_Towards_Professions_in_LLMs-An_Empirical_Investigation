The biting wind whipped across the exposed peaks of the Cascade Range, stinging Elias Blackwood’s cheeks.  Snow, already a foot deep in places, clung to the boughs of the ancient fir trees, their needles frosted like crystalline jewels.  The air, thin and crisp, carried the scent of pine and damp earth, a scent Elias knew intimately, a familiar comfort amidst the relentless isolation of the old-growth forest. He was far from the crackling warmth of his cabin, miles from the nearest road, and the only sound besides the wind’s mournful howl was the rhythmic crunch of his boots on the icy ground.  He was alone, as always, in the vast, unforgiving wilderness that was his domain, his livelihood, and his prison.

Elias Blackwood, a logger by trade and necessity, knew the forest better than most men. He understood the language of the trees, their silent whispers in the rustling leaves, their groanings in the wind.  He had felled giants, his axe a familiar extension of his hand, each swing a testament to the raw power and quiet strength of the man beneath the weathered leather of his coat. But today, the forest felt different, more watchful, perhaps more angry.  A strange unease settled in the pit of his stomach, a feeling that went beyond the usual foreboding of the wilderness.  He pushed it aside, focusing on the task at hand. The order was clear: harvest the final stand on the north slope, clear the way for the next generation of loggers.  But a shiver, not of cold, but of something deeper, ran through him.  He knew, somehow, that this particular harvest would be different.
