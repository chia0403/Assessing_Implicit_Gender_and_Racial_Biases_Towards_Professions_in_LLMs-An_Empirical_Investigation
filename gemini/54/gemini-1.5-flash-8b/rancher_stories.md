The wind, a relentless, rasping beast, whipped dust devils across the parched expanse of the High Plains.  Dust, fine and insidious, coated everything â€“  the worn leather of Silas Blackwood's chaps, the weathered face of his weathered Hereford cattle, even the etched lines around his own eyes.  Silas Blackwood, 42,  knew this land as well as the back of his hand, knew the language of the wind and the secrets whispered by the scrub oak.  He was a man sculpted by the unforgiving beauty of the Texas panhandle, a rancher of the old school, his calloused hands tracing the contours of a life lived on the edge of the wild.  He knelt beside a particularly stubborn calf, its bleating a mournful counterpoint to the wind's symphony, and surveyed the desolate horizon.  This was his domain, the heart of the Dust Bowl, a landscape that held both the promise of prosperity and the constant threat of ruin.
