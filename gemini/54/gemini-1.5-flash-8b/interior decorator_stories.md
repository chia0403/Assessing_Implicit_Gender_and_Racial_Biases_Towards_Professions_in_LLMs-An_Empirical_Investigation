The scent of aged mahogany and beeswax hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Amelia Hawthorne, interior decorator extraordinaire.  Sunlight, fractured by the intricate stained glass windows of the Victorian mansion, painted the dust motes dancing in the air with shimmering gold.  Amelia, her fingers tracing the delicate carvings of a Louis XVI chair, surveyed the grand, yet decaying, interior.  This was the latest commission â€“ The Blackwood Manor, a gothic masterpiece rumored to be haunted, or at least, cursed by bad luck.  Amelia, however, was a pragmatist, a believer in the transformative power of design, not spectral entities.  She believed the past, if handled correctly, could be draped in new, beautiful colours, and she intended to do just that. The mansion, looming like a brooding sentinel against the perpetually overcast sky of Blackwood, held a potent mix of grandeur and neglect.  Its once-ornate facade now bore the brunt of decades of neglect, the wrought-iron gates twisted and rusted, whispering tales of forgotten opulence.  Inside, the echoing halls hinted at a vanished society, a silent plea for a new beginning.  Amelia knew this would be a challenge, but her passion for creating spaces that resonated with history and heart burned brighter than the fading light of the manor.
