The biting wind whipped Dr. Elara Nightingale's crimson coat around her legs as she squinted at the frosted landscape.  The small, snow-dusted village of Alderwood, nestled deep within the Whispering Peaks, clung to the mountainside like a forgotten shawl.  Each timber-framed cottage, smoke curling lazily from its chimneys, seemed to hold its breath, mirroring the stillness of the frigid air.  This was Elara's fifth winter in Alderwood, and while she'd grown accustomed to the harsh beauty of the region, the quiet, punctuated only by the distant howl of wolves, felt different this year.  Something was amiss.  The animals, usually so vibrant with the primal energy of the mountain, seemedâ€¦ subdued.  

The clinic, a quaint stone building with a single, snow-laden icicle hanging precariously from the eaves, was her refuge, her sanctuary, and the heart of Alderwood.  Inside, the aroma of antiseptic mingled with the comforting scent of pine needles, a familiar comfort against the bitter chill outside.  Elara traced the chipped paint on the worn wooden counter, her brow furrowing.  Today, the waiting room was empty, an unusual occurrence.  Usually, a chorus of distressed bleating, whinnying, or chirping filled the air.  Today, it was eerily silent.
