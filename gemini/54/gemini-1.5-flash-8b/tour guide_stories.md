The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwoodâ€™s auburn hair across her face as she adjusted the microphone clip on her lapel.  The fog, thick and clinging like a shroud, swallowed the ancient stones of the Whispering Walls, making the already eerie silence amplify into something almost tangible.  Below her, the tour group, a motley collection of tourists clutching steaming mugs and chattering nervously, were mere specks in the grey gloom. Amelia, however, felt a prickle of anticipation, a sense of connection to the place that had haunted her dreams since childhood.  This wasn't just another historical site; it was a place that whispered secrets, and she, Amelia Blackwood, the Keeper of Whispers, was here to listen.

The setting: The Whispering Walls, a series of towering, moss-covered stone structures, seemingly carved from the very landscape itself, nestled deep within the Blackwood Forest, notorious for its unsettling legends and unexplained occurrences.  The forest, shrouded in perpetual twilight, was thick with ancient trees, their branches intertwining like skeletal fingers.  Patches of fog clung to the ground, obscuring the path and amplifying the echo of the wind.  A chilling mist, often described as "the breath of the dead", had settled on the Walls and hung heavy in the air, a constant companion to any who dared to venture too close.  The air itself held a peculiar vibration, a subtle hum that resonated with the very stones themselves.
