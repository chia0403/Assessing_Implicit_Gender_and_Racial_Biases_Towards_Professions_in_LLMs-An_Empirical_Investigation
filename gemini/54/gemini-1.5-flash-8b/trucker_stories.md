The biting wind whipped across the desolate expanse of the Wyoming plains, stinging Elias Thorne's cheeks as he wrestled his rig, the "Ironclad," into a precarious parking spot.  Dust devils danced like spectral sprites around the rusted metal behemoth, and the only sound besides the howling wind was the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of his oversized tires on the cracked asphalt.

He'd been tasked with delivering a shipment of antique clockwork mechanisms to a seemingly obscure antique shop nestled within these desolate plains, a destination that smelled oddly of woodsmoke and faded memories.
