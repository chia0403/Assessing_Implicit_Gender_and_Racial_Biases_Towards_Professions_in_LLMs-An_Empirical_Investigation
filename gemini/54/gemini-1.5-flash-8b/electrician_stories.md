The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Golden Gasket" appliance repair shop cast long, dancing shadows across the cluttered workbench.  Dust motes, illuminated by the harsh overhead hum, swirled around the greasy hands of  Bartholomew "Barty" Finch, a seasoned electrician with a penchant for meticulously organized chaos.  His worn leather apron, stained with a rainbow of appliance grease and solder flux, hung loosely on his frame.  The shop, situated in the heart of the dilapidated, yet surprisingly vibrant,  Industrial District of Newhaven, smelled faintly of ozone, burnt toast, and cheap coffee.  Rows of vintage tools lined the walls, their metal surfaces reflecting the chaotic symphony of buzzing transformers and the faint clanging of metal on metal emanating from the workshop's back room.  A constant stream of muttered curses, punctuated by the sharp crack of a screwdriver striking metal, filled the air.  Barty, his brow furrowed in concentration, wrestled with a stubborn faulty motor, the whirring sound a mechanical counterpart to the frustrated sighs escaping his lips.  He swore under his breath, a sound swallowed by the ambient din.
