The flickering neon sign of "The Whispering Wires" cast a sickly green glow on the rain-slicked street outside, reflecting in the grime-coated windows of the cluttered shop.  Inside, amidst a jumble of wires, capacitors, and salvaged circuit boards,  Amelia  Everett, a radio technician with hands that seemed permanently coated in solder flux, meticulously adjusted a vintage crystal radio.  The faint crackle of static filled the air, punctuated by the rhythmic *tap-tap-tap* of Amelia's nimble fingers on the workbench.  Her small, cluttered workshop, tucked away on a forgotten alley in the heart of the burgeoning city of Aethelgard, was her sanctuary, her laboratory, her life.  A single bare bulb hung precariously from a chipped wire, casting long, dancing shadows on the assembled parts, illuminating the intricate network of copper and glass that filled the room.  Dust motes danced in the scant light, hinting at the countless stories held within the ancient machines that lined the walls, each a testament to a forgotten age of communication.
