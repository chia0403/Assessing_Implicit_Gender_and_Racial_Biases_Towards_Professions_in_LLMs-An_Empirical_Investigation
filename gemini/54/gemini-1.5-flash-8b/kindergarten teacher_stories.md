The chipped paint of the "Imagination Station" kindergarten classroom, a faded shade of avocado green, seemed to sigh under the relentless afternoon sun.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom of the high windows, illuminating tiny drawings of fantastical beasts and towering castles on the easels.  This was Amelia "Sparrow" Finch's domain, a haven of crayon-scrawled dreams and sticky fingerprints.  Sparrow, a woman whose perpetually kind eyes held a spark of mischievous energy, surveyed her charges, a diverse flock of four- and five-year-olds, each absorbed in their own world of play.  Today, the air buzzed with the excited chatter of a particularly vibrant group â€“ Lily, with her bright orange hair perpetually framing a thoughtful face;  Leo, whose whispered pronouncements often sounded like profound pronouncements; and the ever-enthusiastic, if slightly hyperactive, Maya.  A gentle breeze stirred the fluttering leaves of the weeping willow outside the classroom window, a subtle reminder that the world beyond the colourful walls of Imagination Station was, in fact, very real, though perhaps a little less contained.
