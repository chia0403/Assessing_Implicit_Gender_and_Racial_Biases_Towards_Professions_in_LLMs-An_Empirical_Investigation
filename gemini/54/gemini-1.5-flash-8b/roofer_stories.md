The biting wind, a skeletal hand, clawed at Elias Thorne's exposed skin.  He hunched deeper into the faded, navy blue oilskins, the rhythmic thump of his hammer a lonely counterpoint to the howling gale.  He was perched precariously on the slate-grey roof of Blackwood Manor, a sprawling, gothic edifice that seemed to defy the very elements themselves.  Rain lashed against the corrugated iron gutters, a furious drumming that echoed the frantic rhythm of his heart.  He'd been working for three days straight, the relentless storm a constant companion, the promise of nightfall a distant whisper.

Blackwood Manor loomed over the town of Ashwood, a brooding silhouette against the perpetually overcast sky.  Jagged turrets pierced the clouds, their weathered stone faces etched with centuries of stories, stories Elias wasn't privy to.  The town itself, nestled in a valley choked by ancient pines, was a place where whispers carried on the wind became legends, and legends morphed into the very fabric of everyday life.  Residents spoke in hushed tones about the manor's dark past, about the strange happenings that occasionally plagued the region.  Elias, however, was more concerned with the treacherous angle of the roof and the relentless wind threatening to rip him from his precarious perch.
