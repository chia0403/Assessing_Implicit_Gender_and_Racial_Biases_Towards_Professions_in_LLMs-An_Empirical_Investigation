The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Amy"  Hayes's trench coat around her legs, stinging her cheeks as she stepped out of the squad car onto the deserted street.  The skeletal branches of the ancient oaks lining Elm Street clawed at the bruised twilight sky, casting long, skeletal shadows that stretched like distorted fingers across the cracked pavement.  A faint, almost imperceptible, smell of damp earth and something faintly sweet, like overripe fruit, hung heavy in the air, a scent that clung to the brick buildings like a shroud.  This was the 14th Precinct, a corner of the city that time seemed to forget, a place where the ghosts of forgotten crimes lingered in the chipped paint and peeling wallpaper, watching from the shadows.  Amy, a Detective in the homicide division, frowned.  The quiet was unnerving.  It always was here.  It always held a promise of something more sinister lurking beneath the surface.  This case, the brutal stabbing of a young librarian in her small, dimly lit shop, felt different though.  The victim, Ms. Eleanor Vance, held a key to a mystery that went far beyond the usual petty crime.  Amy traced the thin line of blood on the sidewalk, the blood that stubbornly refused to be washed away by the ceaseless drizzle. This was her case, and she was determined to find the truth, even if it meant venturing into the darkest corners of the 14th Precinct.
