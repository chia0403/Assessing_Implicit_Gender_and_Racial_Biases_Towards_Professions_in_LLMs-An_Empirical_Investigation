The humid air hung heavy over the bustling market square, thick with the aroma of exotic spices and the insistent chatter of vendors haggling over prices.  Amelia Eleanor Kensington, a nutritionist with a penchant for vibrant colours and even more vibrant salads, navigated the throng with practiced ease.  Her crisp, tailored linen jacket, a cheerful emerald green, shimmered under the midday sun, a stark contrast to the riot of reds, oranges, and yellows spilling from overflowing baskets.  Today's mission: source the freshest, most nutrient-rich ingredients for her latest project â€“ a mobile food stall offering accessible, plant-based meals to the city's underprivileged community.  Amelia, with her meticulous record-keeping and passionate belief in the power of proper nutrition, felt a surge of purpose as she scanned the stalls, her keen eye picking out the perfect mango, the most succulent plantain, and the plumpest, most ruby-red tomatoes.  Her mobile clinic was scheduled to open next week, and every detail, from the quality of the ingredients to the positioning of the stall, was meticulously planned.
