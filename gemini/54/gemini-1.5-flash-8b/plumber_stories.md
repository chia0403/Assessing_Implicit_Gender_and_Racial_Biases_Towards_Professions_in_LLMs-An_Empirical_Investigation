The flickering neon sign of "Spiffy Pipes," barely visible through the grime-coated window, cast a sickly yellow glow on Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's tired face.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the small, dilapidated plumbing shop, a relentless percussion against the soundtrack of dripping pipes and the muffled roar of city traffic.  Barty, a man whose once-bright blue overalls now bore the faded, testamentary stains of countless plumbing nightmares, squinted at the overflowing sink basin.  Not another leaky faucet, not another clogged drain, just another Tuesday.  He sighed, the sound swallowed by the storm, and pulled a worn, leather-bound notebook from the hip pocket of his overalls.  His job was a relentless cycle of fixing broken things, a struggle against the relentless decay of the city he served, and a job that strangely, sometimes even oddly, fascinated him.

The shop, crammed with rusty tools and overflowing bins of spare parts, smelled faintly of mildew and pipe tobacco.  Sunlight barely penetrated the gloom, casting long shadows that danced with the dust motes in the air.  A faded poster of a smiling cartoon plumber, clutching a gleaming wrench, clung precariously to the wall, a testament to a forgotten era of optimism.  Outside, the city sprawled, a concrete jungle of towering buildings and winding streets, a landscape that seemed to defy the relentless march of time and the constant hum of its unseen mechanisms. Barty knew, with the gritty certainty of a veteran plumber, that every clogged drain and faulty fixture was a secret to be revealed, a puzzle awaiting his deft touch.
