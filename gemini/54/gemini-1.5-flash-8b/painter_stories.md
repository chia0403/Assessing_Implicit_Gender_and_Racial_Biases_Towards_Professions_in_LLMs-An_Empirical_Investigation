The chipped paint of the "Artist's Retreat" sign, peeling like sunburnt skin, barely clung to its rusted metal frame.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the small, clapboard building, a relentless percussion that echoed through the skeletal structure.  Inside, Amelia Blackwood, a painter of melancholic skies and fractured landscapes, hunched over her easel, a swirling vortex of bruised purples and faded blues spreading across the canvas.  The air, thick with the scent of turpentine and damp earth, was the only witness to her struggle.  The small, dusty studio, lit only by the flickering glow of a single bulb dangling precariously from the ceiling, held the weight of countless unfulfilled promises and forgotten dreams.  The year was 1928.
