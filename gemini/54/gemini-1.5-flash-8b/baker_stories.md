The aroma of freshly baked sourdough, a symphony of yeasty tang and toasted flour, hung heavy in the air of the cobbled alley.  Rain, a relentless, grey curtain, hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Elara's bakery, "The Crusty Crumb,"  a small, almost hidden storefront tucked between a butcher shop and a dilapidated music store.  Elara, a baker with eyes the colour of melted caramel and hands perpetually dusted with flour, squinted at the swirling mist, a frown etching itself onto her brow.  The dampness seeped into the warm bread dough she was meticulously shaping, threatening to deflate its rising spirit.  Elara, full name Elara Thistlewick, knew that today's offering – her signature "Sunrise" brioche – would need more than just a touch of magic to rise above the persistent drizzle.
