The rhythmic *click* of the pneumatic adjustment tool echoed through the sterile, almost antiseptic silence of Dr. Alistair Finch's office.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun piercing the grime-coated windowpanes, illuminating the chipped paint of the Victorian building.  Alistair, a man whose chiropractor's license seemed almost secondary to the intricate, almost obsessive, tattoos adorning his arms, concentrated on the subtle shift in the patient's vertebrae.  He felt a peculiar prickling sensation beneath the skin of his fingertips, a sensation he couldn't quite place, as if the air itself was humming with unseen energy.  The old house, a relic of a bygone era, seemed to whisper tales of its own through the gaps in the boarded-up windows, secrets that Alistair, for all his keen intellect and understanding of the human body, couldn't quite decipher.  Outside, the clatter of horse-drawn carriages and the shouts of vendors drifted in through the open window, a stark contrast to the quiet, focused atmosphere of his small practice.  The city of Havenwood, nestled between towering hills and the whispering murmurs of a vast, untamed forest, held an aura of both quiet mystery and simmering discontent.  Alistair, immersed in his work, felt the unseen energies of Havenwood, as tangible as the x-rays he studied, tugging at his very being, hinting at a truth that lay hidden beneath the surface of his everyday practice.
