The chipped paint of the gazebo, a faded pastel lavender, clung precariously to the weathered wood, mirroring the state of Elias Thorne's own spirit.  He, Elias Thorne, groundskeeper extraordinaire (or, at least, that's what the meticulously-manicured lawns of Blackwood Manor implied), surveyed the meticulously-groomed estate.  Dust motes danced in the late afternoon sun, highlighting the intricate patterns of the topiary hedges, each miniature, sculpted likeness of a mythical beast or historical figure frozen in time.  This, Blackwood Manor, was his domain.  His life.  And yet, today, even the emerald green of the meticulously-maintained lawn seemed to suffocate him.

The air hung thick with the scent of honeysuckle and damp earth, a suffocating perfume that always seemed to intensify around the grand manor house, a gothic confection of dark grey stone and pointed turrets, looming over the meticulously manicured gardens.  The sun, sinking low in the west, painted the sky in hues of apricot and amethyst, casting long, skeletal shadows that stretched across the carefully-tended pathways.  This was Blackwood Manor on a late summer's day, the kind that should have felt idyllic.  It felt, instead, like a tomb.
