The chipped paint on the classroom walls, a faded robin's egg blue, seemed to sigh with the afternoon humidity.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom, illuminating a meticulously organized collection of construction paper animals, meticulously crafted by Amelia "Amy"  Fairchild's third-grade class.  Amy, a woman whose carefully-coiffed auburn hair often seemed to defy the unruly energy of her students,  stepped from behind her desk, a small stack of graded papers clutched in her hand.  She adjusted her oversized glasses, a familiar ritual as she surveyed the now-quiet room.  The rhythmic whisper of pencil tips against paper had ceased, replaced by the soft, almost imperceptible rustling of paper as the children settled into the quiet zone that always preceded dismissal.

The year was 2024.  The school, Elmwood Elementary, was nestled in the shadow of the towering, ever-expanding concrete jungle of Neo-Manhattan.  Tall, glass-fronted skyscrapers pierced the gray, smoggy sky, their reflections shimmering on the grimy windows of the nearby apartment buildings.  The air hummed with the relentless energy of the city, a stark contrast to the small, contained world within the school's walls.  But the children, and Amy, had found their own little pockets of peace, their own havens of creativity and learning, within those walls.
