Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Dr. Eleanor Vance's clinic, a rhythmic percussion that mirrored the relentless thoughts swirling in her mind.  The office, tucked away on a side street of the grey, perpetually overcast city of Aethelgard, was a study in muted tones.  Dusty beige walls, worn floral wallpaper hiding beneath layers of grime, and a single, flickering fluorescent light cast long, uneven shadows across the cluttered desk.  A half-eaten bowl of cereal sat beside a stack of clinical files, each one a testament to the silent struggles of the souls who'd sought her help. Eleanor, a clinical psychologist with five years of experience, felt the familiar weight of the city's anxieties pressing down on her shoulders.  Outside, the downpour intensified, a stark contrast to the quiet hum of the city's anxieties that seemed to be growing louder within the confines of her small office.
