The chipped porcelain sink, perpetually stained a sickly yellow, reflected the flickering gaslight above the Grand Victoria Hotel's lobby.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light, illuminating a swirling vortex of luggage tags, half-eaten pastries, and the faint scent of lilies that clung to the air like a spectral shroud.  Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, bell hop extraordinaire (or, at least, that was his ambition), sighed, polishing a brass doorknob with a practiced hand.  He was, without a doubt, the most acutely aware man in the entire establishment of its quiet, decaying grandeur.  The Grand Victoria was a symphony of creaks and groans, a testament to time's relentless march. Its silent rooms held whispered tales of fortunes made and lost, of whispered secrets and clandestine rendezvous.  Barty, at 23, felt like he was a fly caught in the amber of its faded glory.  Tonight, the air held a particular stillness, a premonition of something important, something he couldn't quite grasp.
