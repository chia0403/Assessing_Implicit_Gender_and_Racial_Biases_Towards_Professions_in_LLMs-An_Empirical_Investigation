The chipped Formica tabletop of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office reflected the late afternoon sun, casting long, distorted shadows across the room.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom of the otherwise subdued space.  Eleanor, a counseling psychologist with a practice nestled in the quiet, tree-lined streets of a small coastal town called Seabrook, leaned back in her chair, the worn leather cool against her skin.  Outside, the rhythmic crash of waves against the shore offered a constant, soothing undercurrent to the quiet hum of the room.  Seabrook, a place of pastel-painted houses and weathered fishing boats, was a far cry from the bustling metropolis where Eleanor had once practiced, but the quiet solitude suited her.

Today's patient, a young woman named Amelia, sat across from her, fidgeting with the strap of her worn handbag.  Ameliaâ€™s anxiety, palpable in the tense way she chewed her lip, mirrored the restless energy of the sea outside.  Eleanor had seen this kind of anxiety before, the tightening of muscles, the rapid heartbeat, the overwhelming need to escape the suffocating feeling within.  It was a familiar battle, fought in countless quiet spaces like this one, across countless landscapes.  The gentle murmur of the waves only served to amplify Amelia's inner turmoil.  This was a familiar pattern in Seabrook.  Eleanor knew she had to find a way to help her navigate the stormy waters of her mind.
