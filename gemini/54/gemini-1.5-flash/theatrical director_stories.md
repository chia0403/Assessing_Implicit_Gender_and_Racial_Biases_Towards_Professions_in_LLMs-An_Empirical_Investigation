The stale scent of sawdust and forgotten dreams clung to the air in the dilapidated theatre, a perfume only Archibald Finch-Hatton truly appreciated.  Dust motes, illuminated by a single bare bulb hanging precariously above, danced in the shafts of moonlight slicing through the grimy windows.  Archibald, or Archie as he preferred amongst intimates (a category currently nonexistent), ran a calloused hand over the chipped paintwork of a crumbling proscenium arch, the weight of his ambition pressing down on him like the collapsing roof threatening to bury the entire crumbling edifice beneath it.  Tonight, however, wasn't about grand visions of Shakespeare or Chekhov; tonight was about securing the funding to prevent "The Grand Majestic" from becoming just another forgotten pile of bricks in the rapidly gentrifying district of Spitalfields.
