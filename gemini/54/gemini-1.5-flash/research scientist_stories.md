The biting Antarctic wind howled a mournful symphony around Dr. Evelyn Reedâ€™s research station, its icy breath rattling the prefabricated windows.  Evelyn, bundled in layers of thermal gear that did little to combat the penetrating chill, hunched deeper into her parka, the collar scratching against her chapped cheeks.  The desolate expanse of snow and ice stretched before her, a blinding white canvas broken only by the jagged peaks of the Transantarctic Mountains, their summits shrouded in a swirling blizzard.  The air itself tasted of frost and ozone, a stark counterpoint to the sterile, metallic scent of the interior of the station, where she had spent the last three months, analyzing data from the deepest ice core ever extracted.  The silence, broken only by the wind and the hum of the generators, was oppressive, a suffocating blanket of isolation that clung to her like the clinging snow. This was her third year at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, and despite the rigorous scientific work, a gnawing unease had begun to settle in her bones, a feeling far colder than the Antarctic winter.
