The wrench slipped in Finley "Finn" O'Malley's grease-stained hand, clattering onto the cold, damp concrete floor of the basement.  Water, the source of his current headache – and his livelihood – gurgled menacingly from a corroded pipe, a low, guttural moan echoing in the oppressive silence of the old Victorian house.  Dust motes, disturbed by Finn's movements, danced in the single shaft of light slicing through the grime-coated window, illuminating cobwebs thick as shrouds and ancient, forgotten relics stacked haphazardly in the corners. The air hung heavy with the scent of mildew, damp earth, and something faintly metallic, a metallic tang that hinted at the rusty secrets hidden within the house's aging plumbing. This wasn't just a leaky pipe; this was a plumbing archaeologist's nightmare, and Finn O'Malley, master plumber extraordinaire (or at least, that's what his business cards claimed), was knee-deep in it.
