The chipped paint of the Georgian townhouse’s front door seemed to sigh under Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s touch.  Rain, the kind that lashed against London in a furious, grey curtain, plastered her auburn hair to her cheeks.  Amelia, a woman whose life was usually a carefully curated symphony of colour and texture, felt utterly overwhelmed by the monochrome misery of the storm and the house before her. Number 14 Bleak Street lived up to its name, a gothic shadow hunched between two brightly lit, modern townhouses, its windows like vacant eyes staring into the deluge. Inside, she suspected, lay a challenge far greater than the usual faded damask and clashing chintz she was accustomed to revitalising.  This was a project, whispered the damp air, that promised not just redecoration, but a journey into the very heart of someone else's sorrow.
