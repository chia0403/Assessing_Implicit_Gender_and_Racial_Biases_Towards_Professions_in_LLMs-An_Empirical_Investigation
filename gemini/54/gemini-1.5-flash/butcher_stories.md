The chill wind, a razor-edged thing whistling down from the glacial peaks of the Cairngorms, bit at Archibald "Archie" McTavish's exposed cheeks as he hauled the last of the day's kill – a magnificent Highland stag – into the back of his butcher shop.  The air, already thick with the scent of pine and peat smoke from the nearby crofts, now mingled with the rich, gamy aroma of blood and freshly-cut meat.  Archie's shop, "McTavish's Meats," nestled at the edge of the small, windswept village of Glencoe, was as much a part of the landscape as the jagged mountains themselves.  Its rough-hewn stone walls, darkened by years of rain and smoke, spoke of generations of McTavishes who had plied their trade, their knives as familiar in their hands as their own.  Inside, the air was warmer, heavy with the comforting scents of roasting spices and brine, a stark contrast to the biting cold that clawed at the outside world.
