The wind, a snarling beast with icy teeth, clawed at Elias Thorne's weathered jacket as he perched precariously on the gabled roof of Mrs. Periwinkle's Victorian monstrosity.  Below, the town of Oakhaven huddled under a sky the color of bruised plums, the November rain lashing against the cobblestone streets like a spiteful lover.  Each gust threatened to rip Elias, and his trusty toolbox, from their precarious position, a terrifying prospect considering the sheer drop to the overgrown garden below, where a particularly grumpy-looking gnome seemed to glare up at him with disdain.  The air tasted of damp earth and woodsmoke, a familiar scent that usually brought Elias a sense of comfort, but today, it only served to accentuate the creeping chill and the nagging sense that something wasn't right. This wasn't just a leaky roof; it felt like the whole house was holding its breath.
