The air hung thick and sweet in the "Sugarplum Sweets" bakery, a cloying perfume of vanilla, almond, and a faint, underlying scent of burnt sugar that only Amelia Grace Hawthorne, head cake decorator, could truly appreciate.  It was the smell of a thousand tiny, carefully executed details, a testament to the hours she'd spent coaxing buttercream roses into perfect bloom and meticulously piping intricate lacework onto tiered wedding cakes.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun slanting through the grimy bakery window, illuminating the chaotic yet strangely comforting expanse of her workstation: a stainless steel table littered with pastry bags overflowing with vibrant frosting, a kaleidoscope of sprinkles, and half-finished masterpieces waiting for her artistic touch.  Outside, the relentless November rain hammered against the glass, a counterpoint to the rhythmic swoosh of Amelia's decorating spatula.
