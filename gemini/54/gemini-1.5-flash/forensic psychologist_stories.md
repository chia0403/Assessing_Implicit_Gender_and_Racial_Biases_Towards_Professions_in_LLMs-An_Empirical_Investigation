The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Mia” Holloway’s charcoal-grey coat around her legs as she navigated the uneven cobblestones of Blackwood’s ancient graveyard.  A skeletal oak, its branches clawing at the bruised twilight sky, loomed over her, casting long, skeletal shadows that danced with the flickering gaslights.
