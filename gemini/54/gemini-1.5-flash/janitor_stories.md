The fluorescent lights of the Blackwood Academy hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic squeak of Elias Thorne's mop bucket wheels.  Elias, a man whose life was measured in the sheen of polished linoleum and the scent of industrial cleaner, pushed his cart down the cavernous hallway.  Midnight had long since passed, casting long, skeletal shadows from the gothic architecture that clawed at the sky outside.  Dust motes, illuminated by the harsh glare, danced in the near-silent air, the only sounds the gentle swish of the mop and the occasional, almost imperceptible sigh escaping Elias's lips.  Blackwood Academy, a prestigious institution cloaked in ivy and rumour, was breathtakingly beautiful by day, but at night, under the watchful gaze of the gargoyles perched high on the stone facade, it felt ancient and unsettling, a place holding secrets far older than Elias himself.
