The air in Amelia “Amy” Holloway’s office hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grimy window of her cramped, book-lined cubicle, danced in the stillness.

It was a paranormal romance novel titled *Whispers of the Werecat's Heart*, and the protagonist, a perpetually brooding werewolf named "Shadow," had just fallen inexplicably in love with a sentient garden gnome.  Amy sighed, the sound a weary exhalation that seemed to carry the weight of a thousand rejected submissions.  Outside, the relentless thrum of New York City faded into a muted roar, a stark contrast to the suffocating quiet of her self-imposed literary prison, a tiny corner of the sprawling, chaotic offices of Blackwood Publishing.
