The acrid bite of chlorine hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the sweet, cloying scent of honeysuckle clinging to the humid night.  Sirens wailed in the distance, a mournful counterpoint to the rhythmic chirping of crickets, growing closer with each pulse of red and blue light.  Rain, slick and relentless, mirrored the anxiety twisting in Amelia Katherine Holloway's gut.

The downpour blurred the already chaotic scene ahead: a mangled sedan, its headlights extinguished, resting awkwardly against a wrought-iron fence, its skeletal remains draped with the gaudy, technicolour glow of a Mardi Gras lantern hanging precariously from a nearby oak tree. The air, thick with the metallic tang of blood and the sickening sweetness of spilled beer, hinted at the grim work that awaited.  This wasn't just another Tuesday night in the Crescent City; this feltâ€¦ different.
