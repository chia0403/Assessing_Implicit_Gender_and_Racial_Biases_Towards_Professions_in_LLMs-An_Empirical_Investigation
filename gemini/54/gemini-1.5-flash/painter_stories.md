The salt spray stung Aurelia Blackwoodâ€™s face, a fine mist clinging to her paint-splattered overalls as she braced herself against the howling wind.  The cliffs of Cornwall loomed behind her, a jagged, granite spine clawing at the bruised purple sky.  Below, the Atlantic roared, a churning maelstrom of whitecaps and shadowed depths that swallowed the fading light.  Aurelia, however, wasn't looking at the ocean. Her gaze was fixed on the lone, wind-battered hawthorn tree clinging precariously to the cliff edge, its skeletal branches a stark silhouette against the stormy backdrop.  Its defiant beauty, even in the face of such brutal weather, was the very essence of what she sought to capture on canvas.  The small, battered easel beside her trembled slightly, threatening to send her meticulously mixed oils tumbling into the churning sea.  But Aurelia held firm, her breath misting in the frigid air, a determined glint in her sea-green eyes.  This painting, she knew, would be her masterpiece.
