The rusty swing sign creaked a mournful tune in the humid Mississippi air, its faded lettering barely whispering "Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins, Barber."  Dust motes, illuminated by the weak afternoon sun struggling through the grimy windowpanes, danced in the stagnant air of the shop.  Bart Higgins himself, a man whose face bore the map of a life lived under the relentless Southern sun, sat perched on a worn leather stool, his shears glinting faintly as he meticulously sharpened them against a worn strop. The air smelled of Bay Rum, stale coffee, and something vaguely unsettling â€“ a hint of ozone, perhaps, or the metallic tang of dried blood.  Outside, the cicadas buzzed a relentless, hypnotic chorus, a soundtrack to the sleepy, forgotten town of Havenwood, Mississippi.  The only other sound was the rhythmic rasp of Bart's honing steel, a counterpoint to the simmering heat and the town's unspoken secrets.
