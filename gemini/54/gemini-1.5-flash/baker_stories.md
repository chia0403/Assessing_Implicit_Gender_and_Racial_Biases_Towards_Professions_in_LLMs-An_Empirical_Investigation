Dust motes, illuminated by the weak streetlamp outside, danced in the shafts of pale light slicing through the grimy windowpanes.  Inside, the air hung heavy with the comforting scent of yeasty dough and warm spices, a stark contrast to the biting November wind whistling around the eaves of "The Crumb and Kettle," a quaint, if slightly dilapidated, bakery nestled on the cobbled side street of Ashton-under-Lyne.  Amelia shivered, pulling her worn woolen scarf tighter, and the bell above the door jingled a melancholic welcome to the new day.  The familiar rhythmic thump-thump-thump of her own heartbeat echoed the steady rhythm of the city slowly waking around her.
