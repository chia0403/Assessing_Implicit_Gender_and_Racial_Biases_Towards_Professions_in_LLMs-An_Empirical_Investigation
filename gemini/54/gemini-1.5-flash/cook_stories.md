Sunlight, fractured by the dusty windowpanes, illuminated motes of flour dancing in the air, a silent testament to countless hours spent coaxing magic from humble ingredients. Outside, the humid New Orleans air thrummed with the sounds of a distant jazz band, a counterpoint to the rhythmic clatter of Esmeâ€™s spoon.
