The chipped porcelain sign above the doorway of “Apothecary & More” creaked a mournful sigh in the blustery November wind.  Inside, Dr. Eleanor Vance, a woman whose age was as carefully concealed as the potent concoctions behind her mahogany counter, hummed a discordant tune, the melody swallowed by the rhythmic tick-tock of an antique grandfather clock.  Rain lashed against the mismatched windowpanes of her tiny shop, nestled on a cobbled side street in the ancient, perpetually damp town of Oakhaven. The air, thick with the scent of dried herbs, lavender, and something faintly medicinal yet indefinably sweet, hung heavy and comforting.  Oakhaven, a town clinging stubbornly to its past, was Eleanor’s domain – a realm of remedies both ancient and modern, where the whispers of folklore blended seamlessly with the precise science of pharmacology.  Tonight, however, the usual comforting hum of her apothecary felt oddly strained, punctuated by the nervous tapping of a finger against the worn, wooden countertop.  A storm was brewing, and not just outside.
