The chipped porcelain sink groaned under the weight of Elias Thorne’s weary hands.  Water, stained the colour of weak tea and regret, splashed onto the already sticky countertop of “The Rusty Mug.”  It wasn’t just the grime that clung to everything in Elias’s small, dimly lit bar; it was the weight of another slow Tuesday night, punctuated only by the rhythmic drip, drip, drip of a leaky faucet and the mournful sigh of the ancient refrigerator.  Rain hammered against the grimy windows, mirroring the relentless rhythm of the city outside – a city that pulsed with a desperate energy Elias felt increasingly disconnected from.  The air hung heavy with the smell of stale beer, cheap whiskey, and a faint, lingering sweetness from the spilled cherry liqueur he’d accidentally knocked over earlier. This wasn’t exactly the glamorous life he’d envisioned when he’d traded his philosophy degree for a cocktail shaker.  But it paid the rent, and that was something, wasn't it?
