The chipped Formica tabletop felt clammy beneath Elara Vance's fingertips, the residual heat from a spilled coffee clinging to its surface like a stubborn ghost.  Elara, a server at the perpetually understaffed "Rusty Mug Diner," sighed, the sound swallowed by the cacophony of clanking silverware, sizzling bacon, and the low hum of conversation.  Steam rose from her own half-empty mug of lukewarm coffee, mirroring the fatigue that settled in her bones after another frantic morning rush.  Outside, the pre-dawn light bled weakly through the greasy windows of the diner, illuminating the deserted highway that stretched endlessly into the bleak, early-October Michigan landscape.  The only sound that pierced the usual diner noise was the rhythmic whisper of tires on the wet asphalt, a soundtrack to the lonely, pre-rush hour quiet that always felt particularly oppressive in the Rusty Mug.
