The wind, a rasping whisper against the granite cliffs, carried the scent of brine and the mournful cry of gulls.  It whipped Elias Thorne's thick, dark hair across his face as he knelt, his chisel a silver glint against the grey stone.  The air hung heavy with the damp chill of a late autumn evening on the Isle of Skye, the setting sun painting the turbulent Atlantic a bruised purple.  Elias, a man whose hands were as rough and weathered as the rock itself, worked with a quiet intensity, the rhythmic *tap-tap-tap* of his chisel a counterpoint to the ocean's roar.  His quarry, a sprawling expanse of granite overlooking the churning sea, was his kingdom, and the rough-hewn sculptures slowly emerging from the stone were his silent testament to a lifetime spent wrestling with the earth's stubborn heart.
