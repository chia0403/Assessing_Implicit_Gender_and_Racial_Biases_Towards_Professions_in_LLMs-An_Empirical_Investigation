The scent of lavender and ozone hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume unique to Shear Perfection, a salon tucked away on a cobbled side street in Prague’s Old Town.  Rain lashed against the leaded windows, blurring the already-dim gaslight glow into hazy halos.  Inside, however, the atmosphere was one of controlled calm, a sanctuary from the tempest outside.  The only sounds were the gentle hum of the hair dryers and the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of shears wielded by Antonín Miroslav Havel, a master craftsman whose nimble fingers coaxed beauty from unruly tresses.  Antonín, despite the relentless downpour, felt a quiet satisfaction settle over him, the kind that came only after a particularly successful transformation.  Tonight, however, the storm raging outside mirrored the turmoil brewing within him, a tempest far more personal than the one battering Prague’s ancient stones.
