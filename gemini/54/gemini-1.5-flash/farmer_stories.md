The wind, a rasping, mournful sigh across the plains of Saskatchewan, whipped Elias Thorne’s weathered face as he wrestled the recalcitrant gate shut.  The prairie stretched before him, a vast, undulating ocean of amber and gold, the late summer sun painting long shadows across the fields of ripening wheat.  Dust, fine as powdered sugar, clung to everything – to his worn denim overalls, to the rust-eaten hinges of the gate, even to the thick, grey stubble that bristled on his jaw.  His farm, Thorne's Stead, had seen better days;  the drought had been relentless, the soil parched and cracked like a forgotten riverbed.  This year, the harvest promised to be meager at best, a stark contrast to the bountiful yields of years past.  Elias, a man etched by the harshness of the land, squinted at the horizon, a familiar worry knotting itself in his stomach.  The bank was breathing down his neck, and the whispers of foreclosure were growing louder with each passing day.
