The grease-stained overalls of Elias Thorne felt like a second skin, a comforting weight against the chill November air that seeped into the cavernous garage.  Overhead, a single bare bulb swung precariously, casting long, skeletal shadows across the cluttered workspace of Thorne's Auto Repair.  Rust-eaten tools hung haphazardly from pegboards, interspersed with faded racing posters and the occasional half-eaten sandwich wedged precariously between a wrench and a spark plug.  The air hung thick with the scent of burnt oil, gasoline, and something faintly metallic â€“ the lingering aroma of a particularly stubborn transmission Elias had wrestled with earlier that day.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the corrugated metal siding of the garage, a soundtrack to Elias's solitary work on a beat-up Ford pickup, its paint the colour of faded dreams.
