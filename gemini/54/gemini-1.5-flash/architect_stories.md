The relentless Mumbai monsoon hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the chawl, a relentless drumming that echoed the frantic rhythm in Anya Sharma's chest.  Rain, thick and greasy, streamed down the grimy windows of her tiny, cramped office, blurring the already chaotic cityscape beyond.

Her drafting table, a battered relic salvaged from a demolition site, was littered with sketches, blueprints, and half-eaten samosas, testament to a night spent wrestling with the impossible:  reimagining the crumbling, centuries-old Bhendi Bazaar into a sustainable, livable community, without erasing its soul.
