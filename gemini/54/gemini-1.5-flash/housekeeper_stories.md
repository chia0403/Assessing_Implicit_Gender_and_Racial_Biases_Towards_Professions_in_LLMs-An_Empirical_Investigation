The chipped porcelain sink groaned under the weight of Eliza Blackwood’s elbow as she scrubbed at a stubborn stain of red wine – merlot, judging by the lingering earthy scent – that clung to the rim of a crystal goblet.

Another week, another stain, another testament to the extravagant, and often messy, lives of the Ainsworth family, her employers.  The air hung heavy with the scent of old money, woodsmoke, and something vaguely unsettling – a hint of something metallic, like dried blood, that clung to the very fabric of the ancient house itself.  Blackwood Manor, they called it. A fitting name, Eliza thought, for a place steeped in secrets as deep as its shadowy, echoing corridors.
