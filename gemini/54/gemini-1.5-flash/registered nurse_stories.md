The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s hair across her face as she hurried down the cobbled street, the collar of her worn peacoat pulled high.  Rain, a relentless drizzle that had been falling since dawn, slicked the ancient stones of Oakhaven, turning the already gloomy town into a watercolour painting of greys and muted browns.  Gas lamps, sputtering weakly against the downpour, cast a sickly yellow glow on the narrow alleyways, their light barely piercing the dense fog that clung to the Tudor buildings like a shroud.  Amelia, a registered nurse at St. Jude’s Hospital, tucked a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear, her breath puffing out in white clouds.  Tonight, however, the usual chill of a late autumn evening felt overshadowed by a deeper, more unsettling unease.  Something felt…wrong. The silence, broken only by the rhythmic slap of her boots on the wet stones and the distant wail of a siren, was heavier than the fog itself.
