The chipped paint of the lighthouse keeper's cottage flaked onto the worn, wooden floorboards like a melancholic snowfall.  A relentless, grey Atlantic churned just beyond the narrow window, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne.  Amelia, a novelist whose name once graced the bestseller lists but now felt as buried under the shifting sands of time as the ancient shipwrecks below the cliffs, stared out at the churning sea.  The salty tang of the air did little to clear the bitter taste in her mouth, a taste that had become as familiar as the rhythmic pulse of the foghorn echoing across the desolate headland.  She hadn't written a word in months, a creative drought so profound it felt less like a lack of inspiration and more like a curse. This isolated cottage, a gift from a long-lost aunt she barely remembered, was supposed to be her sanctuary, her escape. Instead, it felt like a prison.
