The midday sun beat down on Amelia Hernandez's neck, the heat shimmering off the ancient cobblestones of the Plaza de San Miguel.  Sweat beaded on her forehead, clinging to the stray strands of hair that had escaped her neatly braided bun.  She adjusted the worn leather strap of her satchel, the weight of countless historical pamphlets a familiar burden.  The Plaza, usually bustling with tourists, was eerily quiet, a stark contrast to the usual cacophony of chattering voices and the rhythmic clip-clop of horse-drawn carriages. Today, however, Amelia's tour group, "Secrets of Seville's Hidden Alleys," consisted solely of herself and the oppressive Andalusian heat.  The faint scent of orange blossoms, usually a welcome perfume, did little to alleviate the oppressive stillness.  She checked her watch, a nervous flutter in her stomach.  Senor Rodriguez, her usually punctual client, was late.  Very late.  And Amelia Hernandez, Seville's most reliable tour guide, detested being late, even for herself.
