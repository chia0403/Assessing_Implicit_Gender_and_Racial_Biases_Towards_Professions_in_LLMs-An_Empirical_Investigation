The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Hernandez's dark hair across her face as she wrestled the heavy toolbox from the back of her battered pickup truck.  Rust-colored leaves, swirling like frantic dervishes, clung to the damp asphalt of Havenwood Lane, a narrow, winding road that snaked its way through a cluster of aging Victorian homes clinging precariously to the hillside overlooking the churning grey ocean.  The air smelled of salt and decaying vegetation, a scent Amy had grown accustomed to over the ten years she'd lived in this picturesque, yet perpetually damp, coastal town.  Tonight, however, the usual melancholic beauty of Havenwood was overshadowed by a palpable sense of unease.  The flickering gaslight of number 13 Havenwood Lane, a gothic monstrosity with ominous shadows lurking in its many gables, cast an unsettling glow on the swirling leaves â€“ a glow that seemed to pulse with a sinister rhythm.  Amy shivered, more from the premonition of something amiss than the cold, and adjusted the worn leather strap of her toolbox.  This was no ordinary power outage.
