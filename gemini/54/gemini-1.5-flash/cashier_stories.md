The fluorescent lights of "Quick Stop Mart" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Elara Jean Blackwood's Tuesday afternoon.  The air hung thick with the cloying sweetness of artificially flavored gummy worms and the faint, lingering scent of stale coffee.  Elara, meticulously arranging a display of discounted energy drinks, felt the familiar ache in her feet, a testament to another shift spent standing on the unforgiving linoleum.  Outside, a relentless drizzle mirrored the grayness settling in her own mood.  The rhythmic *beep* of the scanner, usually a predictable rhythm, felt today like a relentless hammer against the dull throb behind her eyes.  Another Tuesday, another mountain of mundane transactions to navigate before she could finally escape into the quiet solace of her tiny apartment.
