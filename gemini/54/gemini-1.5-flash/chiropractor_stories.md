The biting November wind whipped Amelia Hernandez’s charcoal grey coat around her legs as she hurried across the deserted town square.  Fallen leaves, the colour of rusting copper, skittered across the cobblestones, mirroring the frantic flutter in her chest.  The imposing Victorian architecture of Havenwood, usually picturesque, felt oppressive tonight, its shadowed gables and looming eaves like the skeletal fingers of a grasping giant.

A chill, deeper than the November air, settled in her bones – a chill that had nothing to do with the weather. The flickering gaslight above the apothecary across the street cast long, distorted shadows, making the already eerie square seem even more menacing.  This wasn't the Havenwood she knew, the sleepy, predictable Havenwood she'd called home for the last five years.  This Havenwood was whispering secrets, and Amelia, despite herself, felt compelled to listen.
