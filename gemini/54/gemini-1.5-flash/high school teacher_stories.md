The stale scent of old textbooks and over-ripe bananas clung to the air in Room 307, a familiar perfume to Ms. Eleanor Vance.  Outside, the late October wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the ancient windows of Northwood High, a gothic monstrosity of a building that had seen better centuries.  Rain lashed against the panes, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Eleanor; not the kind that involved shouting students or overflowing coffee cups, but a deeper, more unsettling unease that had settled in her gut the moment she'd arrived that morning.  It wasn't the usual pre-lesson jitters; this feltâ€¦ different.  A chill, unconnected to the autumnal weather, snaked down her spine.  The clock on the wall ticked with a deliberate, almost malicious, slowness, each second stretching into an eternity as Eleanor stared out at the empty desks, anticipating the arrival of her AP English Literature class, and the day that promised to be anything but ordinary.
