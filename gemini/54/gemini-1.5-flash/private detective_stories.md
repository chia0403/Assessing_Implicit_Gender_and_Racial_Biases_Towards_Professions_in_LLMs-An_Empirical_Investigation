The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Isabella "Izzy" Diaz's office, a sound that was as much a part of the San Francisco landscape as the fog and the perpetually grumpy cable car drivers.  Her office, a cramped space above a failing laundromat in North Beach, smelled faintly of damp wool and stale coffee.  Izzy herself, perched on a wobbly stool nursing a lukewarm cup of the latter, was staring out at the deluge, the city lights blurring into hazy halos through the grime on the windowpane.  The only illumination in the room came from a single, flickering desk lamp, casting long, dramatic shadows across the overflowing ashtrays and stacks of haphazardly filed case files.  Tonight, however, the usual comforting rhythm of the rain was punctuated by a nervous tapping at the door, a sound that promised trouble â€“ and hopefully, a paycheck.
