The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful song around Captain Elara Vanceâ€™s weathered face, stinging her cheeks despite the thick fur-lined hood of her parka.  The air hung heavy with the scent of pine and something else, something metallic and faintly acrid that prickled at the back of her throat.  Below, the sprawling expanse of the Denali National Park unfolded like a crumpled, snow-dusted map, its jagged peaks disappearing into a sky the color of bruised plums.  The only sound louder than the wind was the low thrum of Elara's de Havilland Beaver, its single engine a loyal, if temperamental, heart beating against the unforgiving wilderness.  This was no leisurely sightseeing flight; the radio crackled with urgency, a plea for help from a remote research station nestled deep within the unforgiving heart of the Alaskan range.  Elara adjusted her headset, her knuckles white against the worn leather of the controls.  This was why she flew. This was why she lived.
