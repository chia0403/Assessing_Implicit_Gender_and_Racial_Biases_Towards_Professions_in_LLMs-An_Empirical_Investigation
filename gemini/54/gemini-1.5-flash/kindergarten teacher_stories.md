The scent of Crayola and slightly stale milk hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Ms. Eleanor Vance.  Sunlight, fractured by the stained-glass window depicting a rather aggressive-looking St. George slaying a dragon (a curious choice for a kindergarten classroom, she always thought), dappled the brightly coloured rug where five tiny humans were currently engaged in a spirited debate about the merits of blue versus green glitter.  Outside, the November wind howled a mournful tune against the brick walls of Oakwood Elementary, a sound completely unheard amidst the cacophony of childish chatter and the rhythmic scrape of tiny chairs against the linoleum floor.  Today, however, the usual cheerful chaos felt…different.  A subtle tension vibrated beneath the surface, like a low hum only Eleanor seemed to hear.  It started subtly, with little Timmy’s unusually quiet behaviour, but now…now it felt like a storm brewing on the horizon of her usually sunny classroom.
