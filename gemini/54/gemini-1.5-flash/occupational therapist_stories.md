The salt spray stung Amelia Hernandez’s face as she wrestled the stubborn canvas awning of the seaside clinic into submission.  The wind, a relentless, howling banshee off the Atlantic, threatened to rip the whole thing from its moorings.  Amelia, however, was a woman accustomed to wrestling with stubborn things – recalcitrant muscles, resistant joints, the anxieties of her patients. This awning, despite its impressive size and the gale force wind, was mere child’s play compared to some of the challenges she faced daily at "Seabreeze Occupational Therapy," her small but vibrant practice nestled on the windswept cliffs of Cape Cod. The scent of brine and pine mingled with the faint, medicinal aroma of antiseptic clinging to the weathered clapboard walls.  The clinic itself, a converted fisherman’s cottage, was charmingly ramshackle, its windows rattling a nervous counterpoint to the ocean's roar. Inside, the comforting warmth of a crackling wood stove promised respite from the brutal October wind.
