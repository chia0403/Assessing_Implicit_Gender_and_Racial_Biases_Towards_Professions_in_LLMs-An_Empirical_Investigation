The city’s relentless energy pulsed just beyond the thick glass, a stark contrast to the quiet concentration required within the hushed walls of the dental operatory.  Anya, however, was far from calm. The patient, a nervous young man with fidgety hands and a suspiciously sweet breath, had just confessed to a rather unusual phobia… a deep-seated terror of dental floss.
