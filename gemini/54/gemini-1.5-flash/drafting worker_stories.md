The fluorescent hum of the drafting room was Elias Thorne’s constant companion.  He sat hunched over his board, the faint scent of stale coffee and graphite clinging to the air like a persistent fog.  Outside, the relentless Chicago wind howled a mournful tune against the grime-coated windows of the architectural firm, Wrigley & Sons, a melody Elias barely registered through the rhythmic scratch of his pencil on tracing paper.  The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the room, highlighting the dust motes dancing in the weak light, each one a tiny, fleeting universe mirroring the vast, intricate world he painstakingly recreated on his drawing board – a world of blueprints, elevations, and meticulous details that would one day become gleaming steel and glass.  Tonight, that world was a sprawling, neoclassical library, its columns and arches a testament to Elias's steady hand and unwavering patience.
