The brass nameplate on the mahogany desk gleamed under the soft, apricot-hued light of the lobby:  *Augustine “Gus” Blackwood, Concierge*.  Gus, however, wasn’t admiring his own polished reflection.  He was staring, with a weary resignation that belied his youthful face, at the overflowing bin beside him.  It wasn’t overflowing with discarded brochures or lost umbrellas – the usual detritus of a luxury hotel’s concierge desk. This particular overflowing bin held a mountain of requests, meticulously handwritten on cream-colored note cards, each one more improbable than the last.  The opulent lobby of the Blackwood Hotel, a neoclassical masterpiece overlooking Central Park, hummed with the hushed chatter of a well-heeled clientele, oblivious to the chaos brewing behind the pristine facade of Gus’s desk. Tonight, however, even the usual symphony of clinking champagne flutes and the gentle murmur of conversation couldn't quite mask the low thrum of his impending doom.  It was, to put it mildly, a very bad Tuesday.
