The chipped paint of Mrs. Eleanor Vance’s classroom desk felt familiar beneath her fingertips, a comforting roughness against the smooth anxiety churning in her stomach.  Dust motes, illuminated by the late afternoon sun slanting through the grimy windowpanes of Room 2B at Oakhaven Elementary, danced in the still air like tiny, mischievous sprites.  Outside, the playground’s usual cacophony had faded to a subdued murmur, the final echoes of recess swallowed by the approaching twilight.  The scent of chalk dust and old paper, a scent as ingrained in Eleanor as the lines etched around her tired eyes, hung heavy in the air.  This wasn't just any Friday; it was the last day of school before summer break, a day brimming with the bittersweet promise of freedom and the nagging dread of the ever-present mountain of lesson plans awaiting her return.
