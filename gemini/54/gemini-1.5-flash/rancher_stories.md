The wind, a rasping, gritty thing tasting of dust and sagebrush, whipped across the vast expanse of the Bar None Ranch, tugging at the brim of Jedediah “Jed” Stone’s weathered Stetson.  The sun, a malevolent eye in the brassy sky, beat down mercilessly on the parched earth, baking the already brittle grasses to a crisp.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of red dirt, danced across the horizon like frenzied dervishes, their silent pirouettes a stark contrast to the mournful lowing of Jed’s thirsty cattle clustered around the dwindling waterhole – a muddy puddle more than a trough.  The air hung heavy with the scent of dry earth and desperation, a smell Jed knew all too well.  This wasn’t just a drought; it was a siege, a slow, agonizing strangulation of the land he loved, the land his family had bled and toiled on for generations.
