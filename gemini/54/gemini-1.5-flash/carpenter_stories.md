The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face as he hauled the last of the weathered planks onto the rickety dock.  Seagulls wheeled overhead, their cries a mournful counterpoint to the rhythmic crash of waves against the barnacle-encrusted pilings.  The air, thick with the smell of brine and pine, clung to Elias like a damp shroud.  He worked in the forgotten fishing village of Port Blossom, nestled on the craggy, windswept coast of Maine, a place where the relentless ocean dictated the rhythm of life, and the scent of the sea permeated every crevice of existence.  His small, weather-beaten workshop, perched precariously on the cliff edge, offered a breathtaking view of the turbulent Atlantic, but little protection from its unforgiving moods.  Today, the mood was particularly foul.  A storm was brewing, promising a night of ferocious winds and driving rain.  And Elias, with a half-finished fishing boat hull awaiting his attention, felt the familiar knot of anxiety tighten in his stomach.
