The bell screamed, a metallic shriek that bounced off the brightly-colored walls and was immediately swallowed by the surging tide of eight-year-olds. Miss Eleanor Rose Hawthorne sighed, a small, almost inaudible sound, and pressed the heel of her hand to her forehead. Another day, another tidal wave of energy about to crash over her. Her "Keep Calm and Teach On" mug, sitting precariously on the edge of her desk, seemed to mock her current state.

The setting was the bustling, slightly chaotic heart of Maplewood Elementary School in the small, unassuming town of Havenwood, Ohio. Eleanor's classroom, designated Room 2B, was a vibrant explosion of youthful creativity. Construction paper cut-outs of fantastical creatures adorned the walls, competing for space with alphabet charts and meticulously crafted handprint turkeys (a lingering remnant of last November). Sunlight streamed through the large windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and glinting off the glitter that seemed permanently embedded in the carpet fibers. Despite the chaos, it was *her* chaos, a familiar and comforting mess that held the promise of learning, laughter, and the occasional unfortunate glue-related incident. Room 2B was a haven, a safe place, a space where Eleanor Rose Hawthorne, with all her anxieties and her boundless enthusiasm, could be Miss Hawthorne, the teacher who believed in every single one of her students. And right now, Miss Hawthorne needed a very large cup of tea and perhaps a moment of quiet contemplation before the storm hit.
