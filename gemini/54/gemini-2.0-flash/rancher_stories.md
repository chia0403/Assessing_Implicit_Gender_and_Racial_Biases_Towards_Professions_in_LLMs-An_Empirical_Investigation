The sun bled across the Montana sky in shades of bruised purple and angry orange, painting the jagged peaks of the Crazy Mountains with fire. Dust devils danced across the parched earth, mimicking the anxiety churning in Jedediah “Jed” Callahan’s gut. He squinted, shielding his eyes with a calloused hand as he leaned against the worn, cedar fence post, the scent of dry grass and sage clinging to his denim jacket.

Jed, at forty-two, was the last of the line, and the weight of that legacy, a heavy burden forged in hardship and grit, settled squarely on his shoulders. He ran a hand through his thick, greying hair, the wind whipping strands across his weathered face. Today was the day the bank man was due, and Jed knew, with a chilling certainty, that the Callahan Ranch – the land, the cattle, the history etched into every stone and blade of grass – was on the precipice of being lost.
