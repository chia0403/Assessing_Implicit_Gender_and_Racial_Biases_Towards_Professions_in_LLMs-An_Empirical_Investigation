The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the shack, a rhythmic percussion that threatened to drown out the whirring of the ancient server humming beside Abigail "Abby" Chen. This wasn't some slick, air-conditioned server farm; this was what passed for cutting-edge in the Outer Rim mining colony of Cygnus-7, a place where rust was a design aesthetic and spare parts were rarer than a genuine Terran sunrise.

Abby, whose full name was Abigail Mei Chen, huddled closer to the dim glow of the CRT monitor, fingers flying across the battered keyboard. The air, thick with dust and the metallic tang of ionized minerals, scratched at her throat. Outside, the perpetual twilight cast long, skeletal shadows from the towering mining rigs that dominated the landscape. They looked like monstrous praying mantises, eternally picking at the barren surface for the precious, life-sustaining Luminium ore that kept Cygnus-7 alive, and in debt.

She was hacking, not into some corporate mainframe or government database, but into the lifeblood of the colony: the Luminium distribution network. Cygnus-7 was teetering on the brink of collapse, the greedy Consortium skimming off more than their fair share, leaving the miners and their families with barely enough to survive. Tonight, Abigail Mei Chen, the unlikely savior of a dying planet, was going to try and level the playing field, one line of code at a time.
