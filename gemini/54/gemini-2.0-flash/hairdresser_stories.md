## Story Opening & Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The clatter of Mrs. Higgins' chipped ceramic mug against the chipped Formica countertop was the closest thing Elara Beauregard had to an alarm clock these days. It sliced through the pre-dawn quiet of her small salon, scattering the last dregs of a dream where Leonardo DiCaprio, circa *Titanic*, had asked her for highlights. Sighing, Elara dragged herself upright, the scent of old hairspray and simmering rosemary water hanging heavy in the air. Outside, a bruised purple sky was just beginning to lighten over the sleepy seaside town of Port Blossom. 

**Setting:**

Port Blossom, Maine, was the kind of town that smelled perpetually of salt and slightly rotting seaweed, where lobster boats outnumbered sports cars, and gossip traveled faster than the morning fog. "The Sea Witch's Curl," Elara's salon, occupied a cozy corner spot on Main Street, nestled between Mrs. Higgins' antique shop and the perpetually closed bait and tackle store. The building itself was a weathered clapboard cottage painted a surprisingly cheerful shade of turquoise, a splash of vibrancy against the muted palette of the town. Inside, the salon was a curated chaos of vintage mirrors, mismatched floral wallpaper, and shelves overflowing with various hair products, from Elara's homemade rosemary rinse to salon-quality serums she splurged on from the mainland. The three styling chairs, all rescued from antique auctions, faced large windows overlooking the harbor, offering clients a scenic view while Elara worked her magic.
