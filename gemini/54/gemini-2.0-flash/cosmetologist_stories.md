Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a cosmetologist named Rosalie "Rose" Marie Dubois:

**Setting:**

The setting is the small, somewhat rundown town of Harmony Creek, nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. Harmony Creek is the kind of place where everyone knows everyone, and gossip travels faster than the creek itself after a heavy rain. It's a town steeped in tradition, where the local diner still serves blue plate specials and the Friday night football game is the highlight of the week. Rosalie's salon, "Rose's Rendezvous," is located in a converted Victorian house on Main Street. The faded lavender paint is peeling in places, but the window boxes overflow with vibrant petunias and impatiens, a testament to Rosalie's unwavering optimism and love of color. Inside, the salon is a cozy haven, filled with the comforting scent of hairspray, perm solution, and Rosalie's signature lavender potpourri. The mismatched furniture, collected from flea markets and antique stores, adds to the quirky charm.

**Opening:**

The bell above the door of Rose's Rendezvous jingled, announcing the arrival of its first customer of the day, Ethel Mae Peterson, her gray hair pulled back in a tight bun. Rosalie "Rose" Marie Dubois, standing behind the chipped Formica reception desk, looked up from the latest issue of "Modern Salon" and greeted her with a warm smile. "Ethel Mae! Right on time, as always. Come on in, honey. Let's get that 'do looking dazzling before the ladies' auxiliary bake sale this afternoon." As Ethel Mae settled into the well-worn styling chair, Rosalie carefully draped a protective cape around her shoulders. "So, the usual trim and a touch-up on the roots?" she asked, her fingers already instinctively reaching for the comb and scissors. Ethel Mae nodded, her eyes twinkling with anticipation. "And maybe a little extra lift at the crown, Rose. Gotta look my best if I'm selling Mrs. Gable's prize-winning apple pie." Rose chuckled, her heart warming at the familiar routine. In Harmony Creek, life might be slow-paced, but Rose Marie Dubois knew that even the smallest changes could make a world of difference, especially when it came to a woman's hair, and that was a gift she was proud to give. But little did she know, today's dose of small-town beauty touch-ups was about to be interrupted by a secret that had been simmering beneath the surface of Harmony Creek for decades.

**Why this works:**

*   **Specific Setting:** The detailed description of Harmony Creek and Rose's Rendezvous creates a vivid picture in the reader's mind, grounding the story in a particular place.
*   **Strong Character Introduction:** We immediately get a sense of Rosalie's personality - her warmth, optimism, and connection to the community.
*   **Immediate Conflict/Hint of Trouble:** The final sentence hints at a larger issue, creating intrigue and making the reader want to know what secret is about to be revealed.
*   **Everyday Life:** The opening grounds the reader into a normal, daily life so when the conflict does arise, the reader will find it more engaging and will want to know what happens next.
*   **Character's Purpose:** This is to hint to the reader that Rosalie enjoys her job and has a clear purpose in her life.

I hope this is a good starting point for your story! Good luck!
