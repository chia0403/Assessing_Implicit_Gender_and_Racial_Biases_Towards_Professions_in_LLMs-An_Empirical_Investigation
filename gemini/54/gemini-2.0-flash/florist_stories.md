The air in "Petals & Prose" hung thick with the scent of freesia and damp earth. Sunlight, diffused through the gauzy curtains, painted the cluttered workbench in soft, Impressionistic strokes. The shelves groaned under the weight of terracotta pots overflowing with trailing ivy, vibrant orchids, and the unruly tendrils of climbing jasmine. It was chaos, a fragrant, verdant chaos that was entirely orchestrated by **Eleanor Penelope Hawthorne**.

Eleanor stood amidst it all, a haven of calm amidst the botanical tempest. Her fingers, stained green from handling stems and leaves, delicately pruned a wilting rose. A frown etched itself between her kind, hazel eyes. The phone was ringing - again. Another last-minute anniversary, another frantic apology bouquet. She loved her job, loved the quiet moments of creation, but the endless parade of romantic mishaps was starting to wear on her. Today, more than ever, she felt less like a floral artist and more like a first responder to wounded hearts.
