The humid air hung thick and heavy, tasting of exhaust fumes and the vague desperation that seemed to cling to the courthouse steps. Elias Thorne adjusted the knot of his tie, the silk already damp against his skin. He hated summer in New Orleans.

The scent of patchouli and incense still clung to his jacket from his last meeting with Delilah in her dimly lit botanica, a stark contrast to the antiseptic smell of the courthouse he was about to enter. The Quarter, with its wrought-iron balconies draped in Spanish moss and whispers of ancient secrets carried on the breeze, felt a world away from the sterile logic of the courtroom. And that, Elias knew, was going to be his biggest challenge.
