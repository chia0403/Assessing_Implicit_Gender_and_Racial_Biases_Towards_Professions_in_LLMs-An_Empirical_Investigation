## Story Opening:

The flickering fluorescent light above Janet Eleanor Albright's head did little to alleviate the gloom that seemed to have permanently settled over her office at Albright Insurance. It hummed a discordant tune, a pathetic accompaniment to the silent symphony of paperwork threatening to spill off her already cluttered desk. Janet sighed, the sound lost somewhere between the rustling leaves of the dying ficus in the corner and the incessant drone of traffic filtering in through the grime-coated window.

Sheâ€™d been staring at the same claim form for fifteen minutes, a headache blooming behind her eyes like a particularly noxious weed. Mrs. Gable, bless her heart, insisted her prize-winning poodle, "Sir Reginald Fluffington the Third," had suffered "emotional distress" after witnessing a squirrel pilfering birdseed from their feeder. Emotional distress, Janet thought wryly, that manifested as a chewed-up Persian rug and a considerable vet bill for tranquilizers.

It was just another Tuesday.

## Setting:

Janet's office was located on the second floor of a brick building in the slightly down-on-its-luck section of Oakhaven, a small, somewhat unremarkable town nestled in the rolling hills of Pennsylvania. Albright Insurance wasn't exactly thriving, but it wasn't exactly drowning either. It was a legacy business, founded by Janet's grandfather, built on small-town trust and the occasional game of bridge with potential clients.

The office itself was a testament to faded glory. The floral wallpaper, a shade of beige so offensive it defied categorization, was peeling in the corners. A chipped mahogany desk, scarred with the ghosts of countless coffee rings and spilled ink, served as Janet's command center. Behind her, a framed photo of her grandfather, a stern-faced man with a neatly trimmed mustache, seemed to silently judge her every move. The overall aesthetic was less "insurance professional" and more "grandma's spare room after she's moved to Florida." Outside, the view consisted of a pawn shop, a struggling bakery, and a parking lot perpetually occupied by rusted-out pickup trucks. It wasn't glamorous, but it was home.
