Okay, here's a story opening and setting, keeping in mind the request for a main character who is an author:

**Story Opening:**

The rain hammered against the corrugated tin roof, a relentless percussion that threatened to drown out even the frantic clatter of Amelia Stone's fingers on her laptop keys.  She chewed on the end of a pen, the plastic already bearing the teeth marks of a thousand thwarted ideas. The words on the screen swam before her eyes, mocking her with their mediocrity.  Another paragraph deleted.  Another sigh ripped from her chest.  She hadn't written a single sentence that felt true, that felt *alive*, in weeks.  The deadline loomed, a monstrous shadow that threatened to swallow her whole.

Amelia Stone, the celebrated author of the wildly popular "Whispers of the Willow Creek" series, was officially, and spectacularly, stuck.

**Setting:**

The setting is a remote cabin nestled deep within the Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina. The cabin is rustic, bordering on dilapidated, with mismatched furniture, a wood-burning stove as the primary source of heat, and windows that rattle in even the slightest breeze. It's a place Amelia chose specifically for its isolation; a sanctuary where she hoped to silence the cacophony of the outside world and rediscover her creative spark. The cabin is surrounded by dense forest, a tapestry of greens and browns broken only by the occasional burst of vibrant autumn foliage. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and pine needles. While beautiful, the isolation also carries an undercurrent of unease, a sense of being watched by something unseen in the shadows.
