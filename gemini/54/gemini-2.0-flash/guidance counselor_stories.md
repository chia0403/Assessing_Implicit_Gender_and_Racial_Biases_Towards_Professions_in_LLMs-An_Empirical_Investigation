## Story Opening and Setting

**Opening:**

The aroma of stale coffee and lemon-scented disinfectant hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume that perpetually clung to the beige walls of Northwood High. For Dr. Eleanor Grace Hawthorne, Guidance Counselor extraordinaire, it was the smell of Monday mornings, a blend as predictable as the teenage anxieties that would soon be lining up outside her door. She took a deep breath, the smell doing little to soothe the gnawing dread in her stomach. Today wasn't just any Monday. Today, the dreaded College Application Results were due to start rolling in.

**Setting:**

Northwood High was a sprawling, single-story brick building, the architectural embodiment of suburban mediocrity. Located in the leafy, but undeniably bland, town of Oakhaven, Pennsylvania, it catered to a student body that was largely white, upper-middle class, and fiercely competitive. The school boasted meticulously manicured lawns, a state-of-the-art gymnasium that rarely saw any state championships, and a guidance department, tucked away in a quiet corner of the main building, that was perpetually understaffed and overwhelmed.

Dr. Hawthorne's office, a small, windowless space crammed with overflowing file cabinets and motivational posters that had long since lost their motivational power, felt like a refuge and a prison all at once. A worn, floral-patterned armchair sat opposite her desk, a silent witness to countless teenage confessions and tearful meltdowns. The desk itself was a chaotic landscape of half-filled coffee mugs, stacks of student transcripts, and a perpetually ringing telephone â€“ the lifeline to the outside world, and, often, the harbinger of yet another crisis.
