The fluorescent hum of the office lights seemed amplified at 7:17 PM, a mocking serenade to Eleanor "Ellie" Vance's exhaustion. Stacks of depositions threatened to topple from her desk, each one a testament to the unending churn of litigation at "Goldberg, Klein & Ramirez," the prestigious, and perpetually overworked, law firm nestled in the heart of downtown Chicago.

Ellie, a paralegal with a sharp mind and a caffeine addiction that bordered on dependency, sighed, rubbing the bridge of her nose. Rain lashed against the panoramic window, blurring the twinkling city lights into an impressionistic masterpiece of urban misery. The air in her small, windowless office was stale, infused with the faint, lingering scent of old coffee and the ghost of stress. This particular Friday was shaping up to be just another night where she’d be lucky to make it home before midnight, fueled by lukewarm pizza and the sheer will to not let Mr. Ramirez’s head explode. He was, after all, known for his volcanic temper, especially when facing a tight deadline. And tonight, the deadline for the final brief in the notorious "Westlake Construction Case" loomed like a particularly ugly gargoyle, perched precariously on her last nerve.
