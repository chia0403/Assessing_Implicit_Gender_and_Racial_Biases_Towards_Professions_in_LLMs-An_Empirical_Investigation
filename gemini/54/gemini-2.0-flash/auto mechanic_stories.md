The clatter of dropped wrenches and the wheezing growl of an overtaxed air compressor were the morning soundtrack at Manny's Garage, a symphony of grease and grit played out on a rusty stage. The setting was undeniably blue-collar: mismatched floor tiles stained with decades of oil spills, walls plastered with faded pin-up calendars and handwritten invoices, and a pervasive aroma of gasoline and burnt rubber that clung to everything like a stubborn memory. Manny's Garage was a local institution in the sleepy town of Harmony Creek, a place where chrome dreams went to die, and where the only hope for resurrection lay in the calloused hands and keen eyes of its resident mechanic.

And those hands, belonging to Bartholomew "Bart" McKinley, were currently wrestling with the stubborn lug nuts of a dilapidated Ford pickup truck. Bart, a man built like a brick outhouse with a perpetual smudge of grease on his cheek, grunted with each heave of the impact wrench. His dark hair, usually slicked back with a generous application of pomade, was plastered to his forehead with sweat. The July heat was already oppressive, even before the sun fully crested over the Harmony Creek water tower, casting a long, distorted shadow of Manny's Garage across Main Street.

"Damn thing's tighter than a drum," Bart muttered, finally managing to loosen the last nut. He tossed the wrench onto the greasy concrete floor with a satisfying clang and wiped his brow with the back of his forearm, leaving a black streak across his skin. He had a feeling this was going to be one of *those* days. And unfortunately for Bartholomew McKinley, those days usually ended with him covered in something worse than grease.
