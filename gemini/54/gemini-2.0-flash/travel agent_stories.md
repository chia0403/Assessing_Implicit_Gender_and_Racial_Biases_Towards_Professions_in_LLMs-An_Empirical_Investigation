## Story Opening:

The flickering fluorescent light above Evelyn Grace Hawthorne’s head hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to her Friday night solitude. Rain lashed against the window of “Hawthorne & Haven Travel,” blurring the neon palm tree in the window into a hazy green blob. Evelyn chewed the end of her pen, staring at the half-finished brochure on her desk: “Dreaming of Santorini? Let us make it a reality!” The reality was, Evelyn wasn't dreaming of Santorini. She was dreaming of escape from this rain-soaked town of Harmony Creek, Maine, a town whose very name mocked her current state of internal discord.

Her phone buzzed, the screen illuminating her face with a pale, anxious glow. It was Mrs. Higgins, calling to inquire about her cruise to Alaska. Again. Evelyn braced herself, plastered on a professional smile that would be completely undetectable through the phone, and answered. "Hawthorne & Haven, Evelyn speaking. How can I help you tonight, Mrs. Higgins?"
