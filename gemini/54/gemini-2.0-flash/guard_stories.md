## Story Opening:

The chill that permeated the stone walls of Castle Aeridor was not just the bite of the approaching winter, but a bone-deep dampness that settled into Captain Alora Vane's bones each night. The smell of damp earth, beeswax candles, and something faintly metallic, like old blood, hung heavy in the air. Alora shifted her weight, the leather of her breastplate creaking in protest. The gargoyle perched atop the western gate, her post for the long night ahead, seemed to mock her with its silent, stony gaze. A wisp of cloud momentarily obscured the moon, plunging the courtyard below into deeper shadow, and Alora gripped the haft of her halberd a little tighter. It wasn't fear, not exactly. It was...anticipation. Something was coming. She could feel it in the prickle of the hairs on the back of her neck, a subtle discordance in the usually predictable symphony of castle noises. Tonight, the creak of the wind in the battlements felt sharper, the rustle of rats in the stables more frantic. And Alora Vane, Captain of the Royal Guard, knew that a quiet night was the last thing she could expect.

## Setting:

The story unfolds in the sprawling, ancient Castle Aeridor, perched atop the jagged cliffs overlooking the tempestuous Iron Sea. Constructed from grey granite quarried from the mountains themselves, the castle is a labyrinthine structure of towers, courtyards, and hidden passages, centuries in the making. Within its walls, life is rigidly structured and steeped in tradition. Torchlight flickers in long, echoing hallways, illuminating tapestries depicting heroic battles of ages past. The air is thick with the whispers of history, both glorious and grim. The surrounding landscape is a rugged tapestry of windswept moors, dense forests, and treacherous coastlines. The closest town, Oakhaven, lies nestled in the valley below, its inhabitants reliant on the castle for protection and trade.
