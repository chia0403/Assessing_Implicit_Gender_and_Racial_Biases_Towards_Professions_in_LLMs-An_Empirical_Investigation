## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The biting February wind whipped off the Puget Sound, rattling the windows of the sprawling Victorian perched precariously on the bluff. Bainbridge Island was beautiful, certainly, but its beauty came with a price: a constant dampness that seeped into everything, including the bones of the old houses and the spirits of the people who lived in them. Inside, however, warmth radiated from the roaring fire in the hearth of the main parlor. The scent of beeswax and lemon polish hung heavy in the air, a testament to the tireless efforts that kept the grand old home from succumbing entirely to the elements.

**Story Opening:**

Esmeralda "Esme" Rodriguez sighed, a puff of warm breath momentarily clouding the polished surface of the silver tea service she was meticulously cleaning. She hated this particular chore. Mrs. Vandergelt, the current mistress of "Seaview Manor," rarely even used the damn thing, preferring instant coffee brewed in a chipped mug. It was just another performance, another layer of pretense slathered over the decaying elegance of the house. Esme glanced at the grandfather clock ticking relentlessly in the hallway, its rhythmic chimes a constant reminder that time, unlike the Vandergelt family fortune, was not infinite. 2:17 PM. Plenty of time before Mrs. Vandergelt was due back from her "art appreciation" luncheon in Winslow, which Esme suspected was really a book club where the main topic of discussion was the dwindling size of their inherited wealth. Today, though, Esme had something more pressing than silver to worry about. A shiver, unrelated to the dampness of the island, ran down her spine. She’d been feeling it all morning, a prickling unease at the back of her neck, a whisper of something…wrong… permeating the usually predictable atmosphere of Seaview Manor. And it all started with that photograph.
