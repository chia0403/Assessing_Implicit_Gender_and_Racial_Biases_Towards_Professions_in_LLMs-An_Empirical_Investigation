**Story Opening & Setting:**

The cloying scent of synthetic orange filled the cabin, battling a losing war against the distinct aroma of jet fuel and recycled air. Amelia Grace Davies hated orange juice, especially at 6:00 AM over the Atlantic, 30,000 feet above a grey, unforgiving ocean. But duty called, and her duty, on this particular transatlantic slog from Heathrow to JFK, was to paste on a dazzling smile and cheerfully offer miniature juice cartons to a horde of sleep-deprived, grumpy passengers.

"Juice, madam?" Amelia asked, her voice surprisingly bright despite the deep circles under her eyes. She offered the carton to a woman buried under a mountain of cashmere, whose glare could curdle milk at fifty paces.

The woman sniffed. "Honestly, what is this, primary school? Do you have champagne?"

Amelia plastered on a smile that felt faker than the plastic silverware in her hand. "I'm afraid champagne service doesn't start until after breakfast, madam. Perhaps a mimosa? We could easily add some orange juice."

The woman’s eyes narrowed. “Just black coffee. Strong. And don’t spill it on my Prada.”

Amelia moved on, the subtle thrum of the Boeing 747 under her feet a familiar lullaby that usually soothed her, but this morning, it only amplified the relentless, wearying hum of her job. As she poured coffee for a businessman glued to his laptop, Amelia glanced out the tiny window. The sun was fighting its way through the clouds, painting the edges with streaks of pink and gold. It was beautiful, breathtaking even, but she was too tired to truly appreciate it. For Amelia Grace Davies, another day had begun in the sky, a floating prison of demanding passengers and recycled air.
