The antique clock chimed a melodious six o'clock, its brass pendulum glinting in the soft glow of the lobby lights. For Isabelle Mireille Dubois, Head Concierge of the Hotel Lumière on the Place Vendôme, it was a signal to adjust her posture, straighten the silk scarf around her neck, and prepare for the evening's influx of discerning guests.

The Lumière, a jewel box of Parisian elegance, was Isabelle’s kingdom. Every polished marble tile, every meticulously arranged flower display, every discreetly placed ashtray spoke of a dedication to impeccable service that bordered on art. Sunlight streamed through the grand windows during the day, illuminating the subtle gold leaf on the neoclassical columns, and at night, the hotel transformed into a haven of hushed conversation and clinking champagne glasses. The Place Vendôme itself, a symmetrical masterpiece of architectural harmony, added to the Lumière’s air of exclusivity.

Isabelle knew every corner of this world, from the hidden service entrances to the preferred vintages stocked in the private wine cellar. She knew which jeweler kept a suite of sapphires specifically for the Crown Prince of Qatar, which perfumer crafted bespoke scents for the elusive actress Madame Moreau, and which Michelin-starred chef was willing to open his restaurant exclusively for a single, anonymous billionaire.

Tonight, however, a different kind of guest was expected. Not a royal, not a celebrity, not an oil magnate. Tonight, the Lumière would host a delegation of international art curators, arriving for a week-long conference focusing on… well, Isabelle hadn’t bothered to read the full itinerary. It would be tiresome details about brushstrokes and colour palettes, she imagined, not quite as glamorous as arranging private jets or sourcing impossible-to-find vintage wines.

Still, she was a professional. And Isabelle Mireille Dubois, Head Concierge of the Hotel Lumière, was about to ensure that even the most intellectually-minded art curator had a stay they would never forget.
