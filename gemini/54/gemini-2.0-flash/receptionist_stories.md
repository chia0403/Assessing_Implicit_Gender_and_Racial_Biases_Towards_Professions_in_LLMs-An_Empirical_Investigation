Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a receptionist:

**Setting:**

The lobby of "Innovatech Solutions," a modern, glass-and-steel office building located in the burgeoning tech district of downtown Austin, Texas. Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, highlighting the sleek, minimalist furniture: a low, curved sofa upholstered in grey wool, a geometric coffee table displaying art books about coding, and a single, vibrant fiddle-leaf fig that seemed determined to thrive despite the sterile environment. The air hummed with the subtle thrum of the building's ventilation system and the quiet murmur of conversations filtering from behind closed office doors. A large, interactive touch screen displaying Innovatech's latest projects dominated one wall, showcasing colorful visualizations and scrolling lines of code that were mostly incomprehensible to anyone outside the company. The overall feeling was one of aspirational coolness, designed to impress both investors and potential hires.

**Story Opening:**

The chime of the elevator doors pulling back announced another arrival, but Eleanor Marie Davenport didn't even glance up from her laptop. 9:17 AM. Standard. The early birds were already caffeinating and crunching code, and the stragglers – the “creative types,” as they liked to call themselves – were just now starting to trickle in. Another Tuesday. Another day of fielding calls about lost parking tickets and pretending to understand the difference between Java and JavaScript.

Eleanor took a long sip from her lukewarm coffee, the bitter taste doing little to combat the familiar dull ache that settled behind her eyes every morning. She loved Austin, she really did, but Innovatech felt… antiseptic. A far cry from the vibrant, messy, independent bookstore where she’d envisioned herself working, surrounded by the comforting scent of old paper and the gentle murmur of turning pages. Instead, she was the gatekeeper of this shiny, sterile kingdom, a smiling face masking a soul that yearned for something more than spreadsheets and scheduling meetings.

The person who had stepped off the elevator was a man with a disarmingly charming smile, wearing a perfectly tailored suit that screamed "VC money" louder than the company's press releases. He approached her desk with a purposeful stride, extending a hand. "Good morning! I'm David Sterling, and I have a 10 AM meeting with Mr. Hawthorne. He’s expecting me."

Eleanor pasted on her most professional, and, hopefully, convincing smile. "Of course, Mr. Sterling. Welcome to Innovatech. Let me just confirm that for you." She already knew he was expected. Her entire life at Innovatech was scheduling and confirming appointments. But Mr. Sterling, with his easy smile and the faint whiff of expensive cologne that wafted over her desk, felt different. Maybe, just maybe, this Tuesday wouldn't be quite as standard as she thought.
