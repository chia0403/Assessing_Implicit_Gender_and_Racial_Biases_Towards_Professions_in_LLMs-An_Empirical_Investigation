The salt spray stung Amelia Eleanor Ainsworth's face as she wrestled the "For Sale" sign free from the stubborn, wind-whipped dunes. Amelia hated waterfront property. Not because she didn't appreciate the views, the crashing waves, the sheer romance of it all. No, Amelia hated waterfront property because the elements always, *always*, fought back. It was like the sea itself was actively trying to prevent her from selling these ridiculously overpriced piles of driftwood and dreams.

The setting was Port Blossom, Maine, a picture-postcard town clinging precariously to the ragged coastline. Think weathered clapboard houses painted in shades of periwinkle and lobster-pot orange, the scent of brine and frying clams hanging heavy in the air, and a perpetually overcast sky that gave everything a melancholic, almost haunted glow. It was the kind of place where everyone knew everyone else's business, secrets were whispered like the tide creeping in, and fortunes were made (and lost) on the whims of the ocean. And right now, standing knee-deep in sand, Amelia was feeling like she was about to lose hers.

This particular property, aptly named "Sea Serpent's Sigh," was a monstrosity of faux-nautical design: think porthole windows, a crow's nest observation deck that swayed alarmingly in the slightest breeze, and an interior decor that suggested a shipwreck had vomited out its contents onto every surface. And, of course, it was perched precariously close to the eroding cliff face, which, according to the recent geological survey, was losing an average of two feet a year. A detail Amelia, quite strategically, hadn't mentioned to the prospective buyers coming later that afternoon. Selling this place was going to be a Herculean task, and Amelia Eleanor Ainsworth needed to be nothing short of a miracle worker.
