Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a story featuring a physician's assistant:

**Story Opening and Setting**

**Setting:** The story opens in the bustling, yet slightly claustrophobic, urgent care clinic of "Coastal Care Now" in the small, picturesque beach town of Seabrook, Maine. Seabrook thrives on tourism during the summer months but settles into a quieter, more reflective pace during the long, harsh winters. The clinic, located just off the main drag, is a lifeline for the town's year-round residents and a temporary medical haven for sunburned tourists and the occasional surfer gone wrong. The walls are painted a cheerful, though now slightly faded, seafoam green, adorned with generic prints of crashing waves and healthy lifestyle infographics. The air is perpetually scented with a mixture of disinfectant, hand sanitizer, and a faint undercurrent of the ocean breeze that manages to sneak in every time the front door swings open.

**Opening:**

"Next patient, please," called Evelyn Reed, her voice projecting just enough to be heard over the soft hum of the waiting room television and the persistent tapping of Brenda, the receptionist, on her keyboard. Evelyn, a physician’s assistant, glanced down at the chart in her hand: Thomas Abernathy, 67, chief complaint – shortness of breath. She sighed, a small crease forming between her eyebrows. Late afternoon on a Tuesday in October was always a gamble. The tail end of flu season blended with the start of pre-holiday stress, and the mix rarely spelled “easy.” Still, she adjusted her stethoscope, plastered on a professional smile, and prepared to face whatever awaited her behind exam room three. Before she could fully turn, Brenda buzzed her, the intercom crackling to life. "Evelyn, line one's for you. Says it's important." A feeling of unease settled in Evelyn's stomach. Important calls were never good, especially at Coastal Care Now.
