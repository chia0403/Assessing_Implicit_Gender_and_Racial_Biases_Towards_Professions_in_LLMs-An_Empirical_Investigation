## Opening:

The air in the cramped workshop hung thick with the scent of burnt solder and ozone. Eliza Maeve O'Connell, her forehead smudged with graphite and a stray copper wire clinging stubbornly to her greasy overalls, swore softly. The antique Philco radio, a monstrosity of gleaming walnut and crackling tubes, remained stubbornly silent despite her best efforts. It wasn't the silence itself that bothered her, though; it was the insistent feeling, a prickling at the back of her neck, that something else, something *wrong*, was contributing to the dead air.

## Setting:

Eliza's workshop, "O'Connell's Radio Repairs," occupied a dusty, sun-bleached storefront on the edge of Port Blossom, Maine. Port Blossom was a town steeped in maritime history, a place where fishing trawlers still outnumbered sports cars, and where the fog rolled in thick and fast, swallowing the coastline whole on most evenings. Eliza's shop, much like the town itself, seemed suspended in time. Vintage radios of all shapes and sizes lined the shelves, their dials glowing faintly in the dim light. Tools older than Eliza herself lay scattered across her workbench: a dented multimeter, a collection of tarnished screwdrivers, and a soldering iron that buzzed like an angry bee. The walls were plastered with faded advertisements for radio programs long since forgotten, and nautical maps, charting the treacherous waters surrounding Port Blossom. The air always carried the faint tang of salt and the low hum of the ocean, a constant reminder of the wild, unpredictable world just beyond the shop's cluttered windows.
