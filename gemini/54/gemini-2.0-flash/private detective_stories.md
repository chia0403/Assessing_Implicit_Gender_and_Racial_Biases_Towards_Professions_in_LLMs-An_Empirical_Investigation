Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a private detective:

**Setting:**

The persistent Los Angeles sunshine hammered against the blinds of Jasper Sinclair's office on the third floor of the Bradbury Building. Dust motes danced in the golden shafts that managed to slice through the gloom. The air, thick with the scent of old paper, stale coffee, and a faint undercurrent of desperation, hadn’t been properly circulated since Eisenhower was in office, and maybe not even then. The ornate ironwork balconies outside offered a stunning view of downtown, a dizzying mix of historic grandeur and modern steel, but Jasper rarely looked. He preferred the shadows.

**Opening:**

The buzzer on Jasper Sinclair’s desk screamed, a shrill interruption to the mournful Chet Baker record he had spinning on his beat-up turntable. He ignored it, letting the trumpet wail a little louder, a little longer. Jasper Sinclair wasn't one for answering buzzers, especially not at 9:00 AM. Mornings were for reflection, caffeine, and avoiding humanity. The buzzer, however, persisted, like a persistent cough or a bad conscience. Sighing, he stubbed out his cigarette in the overflowing ashtray, its ceramic surface a faded advertisement for Lucky Strikes, and growled, "Yeah?" into the ancient intercom. A nervous, high-pitched voice crackled back, "Mr. Sinclair? It's Mrs. Eleanor Ainsworth. She... she insists on seeing you immediately. Said it's a matter of utmost... delicacy." Delicacy, Jasper thought, was usually code for scandal, blackmail, or both. He hated Mondays.
