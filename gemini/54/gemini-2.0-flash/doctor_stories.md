## The Story Opening:

The insistent rasp of the telephone sliced through the pre-dawn quiet like a rusty scalpel. Dr. Eleanor Vance, MD, a woman whose internal clock was usually as precise as the instruments in her surgery, fumbled for the receiver, knocking over a half-eaten bowl of yogurt in the process. A sticky, sweet cascade spread across her nightstand, a fitting metaphor, she thought groggily, for the way her life currently felt.

"Vance," she croaked, her voice thick with sleep.

A breathless, panicked voice crackled through the line. "Dr. Vance, thank God! It's Deputy Miller. We need you out at the old Blackwood place. Bad."

Eleanor's heart lurched. "Blackwood? What happened?"

"Can't explain it now, Doctor. Just... hurry. We need your expertise, and... and it's getting dark again soon." The line went dead, leaving Eleanor with a chilling silence and the unsettling image of the Blackwood estate looming in her mind.

## The Setting:

The story takes place in Havenwood, a small, isolated town nestled deep within the Appalachian Mountains of western North Carolina. Havenwood is a place where time seems to move slower, where the old ways persist, and where the whispers of folklore and superstition still cling to the shadowed corners of the woods. 

The town itself is a patchwork of weathered clapboard houses, a general store with a creaking porch swing, and a single, red-brick clinic, Havenwood Rural Health, where Eleanor practices. The surrounding landscape is a tapestry of dense forests, jagged peaks shrouded in mist, and rushing creeks that carve their way through the valleys.

Overlooking Havenwood from a craggy hilltop sits the Blackwood estate, a sprawling, gothic monstrosity of crumbling stone and overgrown ivy. Once the pride of the Blackwood family, a lineage steeped in wealth and whispered secrets, the estate now stands as a monument to decay and neglect. Its darkened windows stare out like vacant eyes, and its silence is more unnerving than any scream. The locals avoid it, believing the Blackwood property to be cursed, haunted by the shadows of its past and the malevolent influence of the mountains themselves.
