## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The air in "The Sprout & Stem" cafe hung thick with the scent of cardamom and freshly pressed kale juice. Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, illuminating dust motes dancing above the sleek, minimalist tables. The walls were a calming shade of sage green, adorned with prints of edible flowers. It was the kind of place where kombucha was on tap and kale chips were considered a delicacy.

**Story Opening:**

Dr. Eleanor Rosemary Finch, Registered Dietitian and purveyor of all things wholesome, surveyed her dominion with a critical eye. One of the newly planted lemon trees flanking the entrance was drooping, its leaves tinged an unsettling shade of yellow. "Oh, dear," she murmured, adjusting her tortoise-shell glasses. "Lack of sunlight, I suspect. Perhaps a rotation with the basil?"

Eleanor, with her perfectly coiffed grey bob and an eternally present linen dress, radiated an aura of calm control. She believed in the power of food to heal, to invigorate, to transform. But even the most carefully crafted green smoothie couldn't mend the gnawing anxiety twisting in her gut. The grand opening of "The Sprout & Stem," her lifelong dream, was just three hours away. And so far, the only people in attendance were a gaggle of overly-enthusiastic yoga instructors and a man who kept asking if they served "real" coffee. Her meticulously planned, nutritionally-balanced fate hung in the balance, as delicate as a dandelion clock in a hurricane.
