## Story Opening:

The insistent hum of the air conditioner was a pathetic counterpoint to the screaming siren in Dr. Eleanor Vance's head. She stared, unseeing, at the watercolor print of a tranquil ocean scene hanging on her office wall, the vibrant blues and greens doing nothing to soothe the knot twisting in her stomach.  She could still smell the acrid tang of burnt coffee lingering in the air, a testament to her less-than-successful attempt to prepare for this particular session.  Her palms were damp. This wasnâ€™t like her. Eleanor Vance, Ph.D., Clinical Psychologist extraordinaire, was usually the calmest, most collected person in the room. Today, she felt like she was teetering on the edge of a precipice. 

A polite, but firm, rap on the door jolted her back to reality. "Come in," she managed to croak, smoothing down the nonexistent wrinkles on her navy blue blazer.

## Setting:

Dr. Eleanor Vance's private practice, "Reflections Counseling," was nestled in a renovated Victorian house on a quiet, tree-lined street in the affluent suburb of Oakwood Glen. The exterior, painted a soft, inviting cream with sage green trim, exuded an air of serene professionalism. Inside, the waiting room boasted plush velvet armchairs, a discreet water fountain bubbling gently, and a selection of tasteful art books showcasing landscapes and impressionist paintings. Eleanor's office, however, was more a reflection of her own personality: a carefully curated blend of comfort and functionality.  

Her large, antique desk, inherited from her grandmother, was meticulously organized, a testament to her need for control.  A comfortable armchair, upholstered in a subtly patterned fabric, sat opposite it, inviting patients to sink into its welcoming embrace.  Bookshelves lined one wall, overflowing with texts on psychology, philosophy, and the occasional well-loved novel.  Natural light streamed in through the large, bay window, overlooking a small, enclosed garden filled with fragrant herbs and flowers. It was a space designed to inspire trust, encourage vulnerability, and ultimately, facilitate healing.
