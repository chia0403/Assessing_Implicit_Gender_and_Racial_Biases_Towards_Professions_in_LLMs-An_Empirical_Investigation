Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a counseling psychologist named Eleanor Vance:

**Setting:**

The late afternoon sun bled through the gauzy curtains of Eleanor Vance's office, painting the room in muted oranges and golds. The office, nestled on the second floor of a converted Victorian house in the heart of Oakwood, a quiet, affluent suburb of Boston, was meticulously designed for comfort and tranquility. A plush, dove-grey sofa faced two high-backed armchairs upholstered in a soothing teal. A low, wooden coffee table held a carefully curated selection of art books and a small, bubbling water feature whose gentle gurgling was meant to be both calming and subtly masking. Outside, the rustle of oak leaves and the distant murmur of traffic provided a steady, almost imperceptible backdrop to the space.

**Story Opening:**

Eleanor Vance, Doctor of Psychology, adjusted the small silver frame on her desk, a nervous tic she was acutely aware of and continually trying to suppress. The photo showed her, younger, beaming, with her late husband, David, at their wedding. A ghost of a smile touched her lips before fading into the practiced neutrality she wore during sessions. She glanced at the clock. Five minutes until her next client, Mr. Silas Blackwood, a man who, after three months of twice-weekly sessions, remained as much of an enigma as the day he walked in. Silas, a partner at one of Boston’s most prestigious law firms, suffered from insomnia, panic attacks, and a nagging sense of… what was it he called it again? Ah yes, “existential dread." Eleanor sighed, the sound lost in the gurgle of the water feature. It wasn’t the existential dread that bothered her – she’d navigated plenty of that in her years of practice – it was the feeling, growing stronger with each session, that Silas wasn’t telling her everything. And Eleanor Vance had learned, the hard way, that secrets had a habit of unraveling the best-laid plans, and sometimes, unraveling lives along with them.
