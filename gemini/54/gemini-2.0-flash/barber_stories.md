The bell above the door of "Sharp Cuts & Smooth Shaves" jingled a cheerful, if slightly rusty, tune as Ezekiel "Zeke" Abernathy swept the last of the day's hair clippings into the dustpan. The late afternoon sun slanted through the shop's grimy windows, painting stripes of gold across the worn linoleum floor and illuminating the floating motes of dust that danced in the air like tiny, lost souls.

His shop, nestled on the corner of Elm Street and Oakhaven Avenue in the quiet, forgotten town of Havenwood, Mississippi, was a haven itself – at least for the dwindling number of regulars who still graced its worn leather barber chairs. Havenwood, once a bustling center for the timber industry, had slowly withered and browned, much like the fallen leaves that clogged the gutters each autumn. The lumber mill had closed twenty years ago, the younger generation had packed up and moved on, and now, all that remained were the ghosts of a livelier past and a handful of stubbornly resilient residents like Zeke, clinging to what they knew.

The walls of "Sharp Cuts & Smooth Shaves" were plastered with faded photographs: Havenwood High's 1968 football team, Zeke’s smiling mother holding him as a baby, a sepia-toned portrait of his grandfather, the shop's founder, looking sternly into the camera. The scent of talcum powder, old leather, and a lingering hint of bay rum hung heavy in the air, a comforting perfume of simpler times, a perfume Zeke was starting to worry he'd be the last to inhale.
