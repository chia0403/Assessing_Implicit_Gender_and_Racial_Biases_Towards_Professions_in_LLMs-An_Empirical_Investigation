The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous dirge, reflecting off the rows upon rows of blister packs and amber vials. Outside, a late autumn storm was rattling the windows of Miller's Pharmacy, but inside, the air hung thick with the scent of alcohol and a quiet, persistent hope. Abigail Rose Hawthorne, a pharmacist of thirty-two with perpetually tired eyes and a surprisingly sharp wit, sighed and rubbed the bridge of her nose. It was almost eight PM, closing time, and the only sound besides the weather and the hum was the rhythmic thud of the automatic pill counter whirring in the back.

Miller's Pharmacy wasn't much to look at. Nestled in the heart of Havenwood, Maine, a town celebrated more for its picturesque coastline and lobster festivals than for its cutting-edge healthcare, it was a small, family-owned institution clinging to life in an era of big-box chains. The shelves were lined with familiar remedies: cough syrups, antacids, vitamins, and the odd selection of greeting cards that always seemed slightly outdated. Mrs. Higgins, Abigail's elderly neighbor, had insisted on stocking them, claiming they were "essential to community spirit."

Havenwood itself was a town where everyone knew everyone's business, and Miller's, as one of the few places to escape the relentless winds coming off the Atlantic, often served as an unofficial community gathering place. Abigail had grown up in Havenwood, had witnessed its joys and its heartaches, and knew the names and dosages of almost every regular who shuffled through her doors. She knew which elderly widower needed a friendly ear, which young mother was struggling with postpartum anxiety, and which teenager was secretly buying acne cream to impress a boy.

This evening, however, the usual comforting familiarity felt like a weight. The storm outside seemed to mirror the brewing storm inside her, a feeling she couldn't quite name, but knew involved more than just the approaching winter blues.
