## Story Opening:

The biting wind clawed at Isaiah "Izzy" O'Malley's exposed cheeks, painting them a painful crimson. He spat into the fresh snow, the brown fleck disappearing almost instantly. The roar of the chainsaw, usually a comforting lullaby, seemed to mock him today, a mechanical beast hungry for more than just wood. He adjusted his worn leather gloves, the familiar scent of pine and sweat doing little to soothe the knot of unease that tightened in his gut. Something felt wrong. Not just the usual ache in his back or the sting of sawdust in his eyes, but a deeper, more primal wrongness that vibrated through the ancient forest around him. He glanced up, the towering hemlocks and Douglas firs reaching towards the overcast sky like skeletal fingers. They hadn't seemed this… angry before.

## Setting:

The year is 1932. Isaiah and his logging crew are working a particularly remote and untouched section of the Olympic National Forest in Washington State. The area is known locally as "Whispering Pines," a name earned from the haunting sigh the wind makes as it rushes through the dense canopy. Deep ravines carve through the landscape, cloaked in ferns and moss, hiding the skeletal remains of fallen giants. The logging camp itself is a cluster of rough-hewn cabins built from logs, a communal mess hall, and a makeshift stable for the mules that haul the timber. It’s a harsh, isolated existence, where the only company is the relentless forest and the other men who brave its dangers for a paycheck. The nearest town, Forks, is a bumpy, half-day journey by truck, making the camp a self-sufficient world ruled by the rhythm of the falling trees and the constant threat of injury.
