The sterile, humming chill of operating room 7 was a second skin to Dr. Eleanor Vivian Harding. Outside, the March wind howled a mournful symphony against the glass panes of St. Jude's Hospital, but in here, time folded itself into a tight, focused loop. The only sound beyond the whirring machinery was the rhythmic beep of the patient's heart monitor, a steady percussion against the frantic, silent dance of her own thoughts. Eleanor adjusted the high-powered lamp, its beam cutting through the fluorescent glare to illuminate the precarious landscape of the patient's abdomen. Her gloved hands, steady as granite, held the dissecting scissors, poised over a web of inflamed tissue. Today, she was not Eleanor, a woman wrestling with a crumbling marriage and the weight of her father's legacy. Today, she was Harding, the surgeon, and in this room, life and death balanced precariously on the edge of her blade.
