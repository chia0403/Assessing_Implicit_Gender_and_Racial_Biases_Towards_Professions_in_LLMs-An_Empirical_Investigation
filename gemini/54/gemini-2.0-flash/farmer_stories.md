The wind, a belligerent drunk, slapped Thomas Oliver Ainsworth across the face as he wrestled with the sagging barn door. Rain, cold and insistent, needled its way down the back of his neck, pooling uncomfortably beneath his threadbare collar. October in Lincolnshire was a cruel mistress, promising bountiful harvests one minute and delivering bone-chilling squalls the next.

He braced himself, the splintered wood biting into his calloused hands, and heaved. With a groan that echoed his own aching back, the door finally gave way, revealing the shadowy interior. Dust motes danced in the weak light that filtered through the cracks in the roof, illuminating rows of empty stalls, a rusting hay baler, and the lingering smell of damp earth and forgotten harvests.

Ainsworth Farm, his familyâ€™s holding for generations, stood on a low rise overlooking the flat, fertile plains of Lincolnshire. The farmhouse, a sturdy but worn brick structure, hunkered low against the horizon, its windows like weary eyes. Fields, once vibrant with the golds and greens of barley and wheat, now lay fallow, a dull brown under the leaden sky. It was a scene of quiet desolation, reflecting the quiet despair that had settled in Thomas's heart. He just didn't know how much longer he could keep the farm afloat.
