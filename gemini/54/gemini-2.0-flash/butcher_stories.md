## The Story Opening:

The clang of Ernest Bartholomew's cleaver against the butcher block echoed through the shop, a sharp, metallic punctuation to the already cacophonous symphony of the morning. He wasn't aiming for melody, just efficiency. The fat he was rendering shimmered under the harsh fluorescent lights, each strike sending up a tiny spray of molten pearl that cooled almost instantly on his freckled forearms. Ernest wasn't a butcher who romanticized his trade. He didn't see art in the marbling, or poetry in the cut. He saw meat. He saw sustenance. He saw, above all, a job that needed doing, and doing well. A job that had been in his family for three generations, and one he couldn't quite imagine escaping.

He paused, wiping his brow with the back of his leather apron, leaving a greasy streak. The bell above the door jingled, announcing the arrival of his first customer. A young woman, shivering slightly in her thin coat, peered at the rows of sausages displayed in the refrigerated case, her breath misting in the cold air.

"Morning, love," Ernest said, his voice gruff but not unkind. "What can I get for you today?"

## The Setting:

**Bartholomew & Sons Quality Meats** sat on a quiet corner of Willow Creek, a small, unremarkable town nestled in the foothills of the Catskill Mountains. The shop was a relic, a holdout against the tide of supermarkets and pre-packaged cuts. The dark green awning, faded and cracked with age, still proudly displayed the family name in chipped gold lettering. Inside, the walls were tiled in a utilitarian white, stained in places with decades of splattered blood and grease that no amount of scrubbing could erase. The air perpetually smelled of sawdust, raw meat, and a faint, lingering smokiness from the sausage-making process.

The butcher's block, a massive, ancient thing, dominated the center of the shop. It bore the countless scars of Ernest, his father, and his grandfather's tireless work. Behind it, a stainless steel counter housed a scale, a cash register that likely predated the internet, and an assortment of knives, cleavers, and saws, each meticulously sharpened and oiled.

Beyond the counter, the refrigerated display case stretched along one wall, showcasing a tempting array of cuts: glistening steaks, plump roasts, and neatly arranged sausages, all carefully labeled with handwritten tags. The back room, visible through a swinging door, held the walk-in refrigerator, a cold, echoing space where freshly slaughtered carcasses hung like macabre sculptures, awaiting their turn under Ernest's skilled hand.
