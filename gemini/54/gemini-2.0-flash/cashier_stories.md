## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights of the "Quick Stop Mart" hummed a monotonous song above Agnes Pearl Hawthorne, a lullaby of late-night convenience and simmering boredom. Agnes, 28 and perpetually tired, scanned the barcode of a bag of microwave popcorn for what felt like the thousandth time that evening. The customer, a lanky teenager with headphones glued to his ears, barely glanced at her, his eyes fixed on the glowing screen of his phone. Agnes sighed, the sound lost in the whoosh of the automatic doors as another customer entered, the bell above announcing their arrival with a tinny, almost mocking chime. It was 11:47 PM, thirteen minutes until the sweet release of closing time, thirteen minutes standing between Agnes and the worn-out floral couch that had been patiently waiting for her all day. Tonight, however, the mundane rhythm of her shift felt different, charged with an unsettling stillness, like the air before a summer thunderstorm.

## Setting:

**Location:** Quick Stop Mart, a small convenience store located on the corner of Elm Street and Oak Avenue in the sleepy suburban town of Havenwood, Ohio.

**Time:** 11:47 PM, a Thursday night in late October. The air outside is crisp and carries the scent of decaying leaves.

**Description:** The Quick Stop Mart is a typical convenience store, filled with brightly colored displays of snacks, drinks, and toiletries. The shelves are stocked haphazardly, a testament to the rushed stocking habits of the day shift. The linoleum floor is scuffed and worn, and the walls are painted a faded beige. The checkout counter is cluttered with promotional flyers for lottery tickets and discount candy. The lighting is harsh and unflattering, casting long shadows and highlighting the dust motes dancing in the air. A small coffee machine gurgles quietly in the corner, emanating the faint aroma of stale coffee. Outside, a single streetlamp casts a weak circle of light, barely penetrating the surrounding darkness.
