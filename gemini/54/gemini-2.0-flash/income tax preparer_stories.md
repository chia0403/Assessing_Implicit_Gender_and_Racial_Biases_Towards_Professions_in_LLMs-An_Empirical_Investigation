## The Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights of "Tax Time Today!" buzzed with the manic energy of a disturbed hive. Mildred Abigail Higgins, spreadsheet-toting queen of this particular colony, stifled a yawn that threatened to dislocate her jaw. April 14th. One day until the end. One day until the onslaught of desperate, crumpled receipts, half-baked deductions, and plaintive pleas for a bigger refund finally ceased.

Mildred, perched precariously on a rolling office chair missing a wheel, surveyed her domain. Her desk, a monument to organized chaos, was stacked high with manila folders, each labeled with names ranging from the mundane (Smith, Johnson) to the baffling (Xylophone, Qwerty). A half-eaten bag of cheddar and sour cream chips lay open beside a thermal mug proclaiming "World's Okayest Tax Accountant." Her eyes, magnified behind sensible, rectangular glasses, darted from the glowing screen of her computer to the anxious face of her next appointment: Mr. Bartholomew “Barty” Butterfield, a man who looked perpetually surprised, as if he'd just discovered his own nose.

Barty fidgeted, his tie askew, his briefcase clutched like a lifeline. "Mrs. Higgins," he stammered, his voice a nervous squeak, "are you absolutely *certain* about that home office deduction? I mean, my hamster, Mr. Nibbles, spends most of his time in there... isn't he technically..."

Mildred sighed, a sound barely audible over the hum of the overworked HVAC system. Another long day, another existential hamster crisis. Just another day in the life of Mildred Abigail Higgins, defender of the diligent taxpayer and slayer of the Schedule C demons.

## The Setting:

**Tax Time Today!** is located in a strip mall on the outskirts of Harmony Falls, Ohio. The building is a drab, beige box nestled between a discount mattress store and a struggling dry cleaner. The interior is equally uninspiring:

*   **Color Palette:** A symphony of beige and gray, punctuated by the garish blues and reds of outdated promotional posters for tax software.
*   **Furniture:** Mismatched and worn. The desks are cheap laminate, the chairs are salvaged from who-knows-where, and the waiting room furniture looks like it was donated from a nursing home.
*   **Ambiance:** A constant hum of computers, printers, and stressed-out taxpayers. The air is thick with the scent of cheap coffee and anxiety.
*   **Decor:** Minimalist. A motivational poster featuring a majestic bald eagle is ironically positioned above a malfunctioning paper shredder. A dusty artificial fern sits forlornly in a corner, a testament to forgotten dreams.

In short, "Tax Time Today!" is the epitome of unglamorous, a stark reminder of the inevitable burden of taxes, even in the idyllic, yet secretly chaotic, town of Harmony Falls.
