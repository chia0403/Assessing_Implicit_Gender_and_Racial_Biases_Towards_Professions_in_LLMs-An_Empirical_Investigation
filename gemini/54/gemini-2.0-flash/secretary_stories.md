## Opening:

Agnes Primrose clutched her lukewarm coffee, the condensation slick against her palm. The clatter of the building site next door, a cacophony of drilling and shouted instructions, vibrated through the grimy windows of the Law Offices of Finch & Featherstone. It was a symphony Agnes knew intimately, the soundtrack to her increasingly monotonous life. She was, as usual, the first one in, a silent sentinel guarding the secrets and paperwork of two men whose only interaction with her seemed to be issuing increasingly bizarre demands. Today, it was Mr. Finch, bless his cotton socks and perpetually stained tie, who had called her late last night. He needed a specific deposition, archived back in 1987, before 9 AM. Agnes, armed with caffeine and a weary resignation, was already sifting through the dusty depths of the filing cabinet, the clock ticking with a malevolent glee.

## Setting:

The Law Offices of Finch & Featherstone were located on the second floor of a once-grand, now dilapidated building in the less fashionable end of St. Giles Street. The building's glory days were long past, evident in the peeling paint, the cracked marble staircase, and the faint, lingering scent of pipe tobacco that permeated the air. Inside the office, the atmosphere was equally antiquated. Heavy oak furniture, scarred and stained with generations of legal battles, crowded the small space. The walls were lined with overflowing bookshelves, threatening to topple at any moment. Agnes' desk, a chipped and varnished affair, was nestled in a corner, strategically positioned between the reception area and the two partners' offices, allowing her to monitor everything with the stealth of a seasoned spy (though mostly she just watched the pigeons roosting on the window ledge). The only modern convenience was the electric typewriter, a clunky beast that Agnes referred to as "The Hammer," which she operated with a practiced, yet resentful, efficiency. The overall impression was one of perpetual twilight, a place where time seemed to slow to a crawl, and the weight of forgotten cases hung heavy in the air.
