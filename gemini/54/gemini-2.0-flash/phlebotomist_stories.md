## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights of the third-floor outpatient clinic hummed, a sound Amelia Beatrice Carter had grown so accustomed to, she barely registered it anymore. Today, however, the hum vibrated through her bones, a subtle prelude to the storm brewing in her stomach. Amelia took a deep breath, the sterile scent of antiseptic clinging to the air, and smoothed down the wrinkles of her navy blue scrubs. This was her fifth double shift in a row, and the dark circles under her perpetually tired eyes were threatening to form permanent fixtures. She checked the waiting room log – a sea of names blurring together – and mentally prepared herself for the symphony of veins she was about to face: the thin, the fragile, the rolling, the buried, the brave, and the utterly terrified.

## Setting:

The story takes place in the Outpatient Phlebotomy Department of St. Jude's Hospital, a large, bustling medical center located in the heart of downtown Chicago. The department itself is a relatively small space, comprised of six individual phlebotomy stations, each separated by thin, worn curtains. A long, uncomfortable row of vinyl chairs lines one wall, serving as the waiting area. The walls are painted a calming, yet ultimately depressing, shade of pale green, adorned with outdated posters promoting flu shots and the importance of hand hygiene. The constant background noise is a cacophony of beeping machines, hurried footsteps, muffled conversations, and the occasional sharp intake of breath followed by a nervous giggle. Beyond the phlebotomy stations, a small, cramped lab hums with activity, centrifuges spinning and technicians meticulously analyzing samples. The whole place reeks of a strange cocktail of antiseptic, blood, and quiet desperation.
