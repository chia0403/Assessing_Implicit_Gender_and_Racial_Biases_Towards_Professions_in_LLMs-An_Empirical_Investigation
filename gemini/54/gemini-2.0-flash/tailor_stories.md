## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The year is 1938. The cobbled streets of Prague are alive with the nervous energy of a city on the brink. Sunlight streams through the tall, narrow windows of a building in the Jewish Quarter, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and casting long shadows across the room. The sounds of distant trams, the hawkers' cries, and the muffled conversations in Czech and Yiddish drift up from the street below.

**Story Opening:**

The needle, a silver sliver in *Elias Abraham Morgenstern's* calloused hand, moved with the practiced grace of a seasoned conductor. He was hunched over a meticulously crafted tweed jacket, the finest Scottish wool he'd managed to acquire despite the increasing difficulties in procuring imported goods. Elias pursed his lips, the lines etched deeply around them a testament to his sixty years and a life lived in the pursuit of perfect stitches. Outside, the newsboys were shouting something about Chamberlain and Hitler, but Elias blocked them out. Politics were for fools, and perfect tailoring was a sanctuary. He needed to ease the tension in the left shoulder seam, a subtle adjustment that would make the jacket sit just so, a garment worthy of the wealthy Professor Klima who had commissioned it. Professor Klima, a man known for his exacting standards and even more exacting criticisms, would be his undoing if Elias failed to deliver. And failure, Elias reminded himself, was simply not an option. Not now. Not ever. The rhythmic *snip, snip, snip* of his shears was the only sound he allowed himself to hear, a steady heartbeat against the rising tide of uncertainty washing over Prague.
