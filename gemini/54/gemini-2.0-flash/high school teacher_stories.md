The aroma of stale coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air of the teachers' lounge, a scent familiar enough to be almost comforting. Mrs. Henderson had left her half-eaten blueberry muffin again, its pathetic, glazed dome a tiny monument to good intentions left unfinished. Sunlight, what little there was of it in late November, slanted through the dusty blinds, illuminating motes of chalk dust swirling in the air.

This was Monday morning at Northwood High, and for Alistair Finch, American Literature teacher extraordinaire (at least in his own mind), it was the beginning of another week of trying to convince teenagers that Emily Dickinson was more interesting than TikTok. He stared into his own mug, the chipped porcelain lukewarm against his fingertips, and sighed. He really needed to start remembering to bring his good thermos.

Alistair Finch had been teaching at Northwood for six years, a respectable stint in a respectable school in a respectable, if somewhat unremarkable, suburban town called Oakhaven, just outside of Philadelphia. Oakhaven was a place where the houses were all perfectly spaced, the lawns were meticulously manicured, and the drama, usually, stayed relegated to the school hallways. But Alistair, with his tweed jackets, his overly-enthusiastic lectures, and his genuine love for the written word, often felt like an eccentric outlier in this carefully curated landscape. He just needed something - *anything* - to shake him out of his comfortable, predictable routine.
