The scent of mint and fear hung heavy in the air, a familiar aroma that Beatrice “Bea” Eleanor Ainsworth could practically taste. Bea scrubbed her hands vigorously at the stainless steel sink, the antibacterial soap doing little to wash away the echo of a small child's wail still ringing in her ears. It wasn't the child’s fault, of course. It was a Tuesday morning at Pleasant Plains Pediatric Dentistry in the quaint, if slightly decaying, town of Harmony Creek, Pennsylvania, and Tuesdays were always… trying.

Harmony Creek, nestled deep in the Allegheny Mountains, was a place where time seemed to move a little slower. The Victorian houses, painted in varying shades of pastel, lined streets named after trees and virtues. The townsfolk, a mix of aging coal miners, young families seeking a simpler life, and eccentric artists drawn to the area’s rumored mystical energies, all knew each other's business. And, apparently, all passed down the same fear of dental appointments from generation to generation.

Pleasant Plains itself was a relic, a testament to a bygone era of dental care. Dr. Albright, the practice owner, was a kind, elderly man with a penchant for whistling and a surprisingly strong grip. The equipment, while functional, was definitely showing its age – the drills whined a little louder, the x-ray machine sputtered a little more dramatically, and the floral patterned upholstery on the dental chairs had seen better decades. Bea loved the history of the place, the sense of community it fostered, but sometimes, she felt like she was working in a museum exhibit, rather than a modern dental practice. And some days, like today, the weight of the past felt a little too heavy, the scent of mint and fear a little too potent.
