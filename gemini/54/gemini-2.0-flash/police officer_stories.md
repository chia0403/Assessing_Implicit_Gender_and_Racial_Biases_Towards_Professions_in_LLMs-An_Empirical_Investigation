The stale, recycled air of the dispatch office clung to Officer Isabella “Izzy” Rossi like a damp shroud, a constant reminder of the dead-end shifts and simmering frustrations that defined her life these days. It was 3:17 AM on a Tuesday, the kind of time when even the rats of Port Aligned, New Jersey, seemed to be sleeping in. The blinking cursor on her computer screen mocked her inactivity, a tiny green spark against the monotonous grey of the department-issued monitor.

Izzy, all five-foot-seven of her, leaned back in her worn-out chair, the squeak of the faux leather a familiar, grating sound. The only other sound besides the rhythmic hum of the server room and the occasional crackle from the police radio was the rhythmic tapping of her fingernails against the worn Formica desktop. Outside, the city dripped with a pre-dawn gloom. Port Aligned was a city built on the backs of industry, now slowly crumbling as the factories and warehouses rusted and decayed. The docks, once a vibrant hub of activity, were now mostly silent, the only sounds the mournful cry of gulls and the creaking of decaying timber. Even the streetlights seemed to cast a jaundiced glare, reflecting off the slick asphalt and the boarded-up windows of the surrounding businesses.

Izzy hated these late shifts. She craved the adrenaline of a chase, the satisfaction of bringing order to chaos. Instead, she was stuck monitoring the city’s heartbeat, a dull thrum of petty crimes and desperate calls for help that never quite amounted to anything. This particular district, District 4, was especially bleak. A patchwork of crumbling brownstones, neglected parks, and abandoned factories, it was a breeding ground for despair and the kind of opportunistic crime that never made the headlines, but slowly eroded the soul of the city. She’d joined the force to make a difference, to protect and serve. Lately, all she felt like she was protecting was her sanity.
