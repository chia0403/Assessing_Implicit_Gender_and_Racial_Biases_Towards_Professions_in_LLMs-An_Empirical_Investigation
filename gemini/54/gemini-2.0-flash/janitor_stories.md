The sickly sweet scent of industrial cleaner hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the stale cigarette smoke clinging to every corner of the "Emerald Dragon" karaoke bar. For Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins, it was the smell of Monday morning, a scent he'd grown intimately familiar with over the past seven years. He hummed a tuneless melody under his breath, the bucket of soapy water sloshing a rhythm against his shin as he meticulously scrubbed the red and gold lacquer off the stage floor.

The Emerald Dragon, nestled in the heart of Oakhavenâ€™s dwindling Chinatown, was a fading relic of a bygone era. Once, it had pulsed with life, echoing with the off-key enthusiasm of amateur singers and the clinking of glasses overflowing with questionable cocktails. Now, the stage lights flickered erratically, the plush velvet booths were threadbare, and the clientele consisted mostly of regulars nursing lukewarm beer and memories of better days. Bart felt a pang of something akin to fondness for the place. It was quiet, predictable, and paid just enough to keep him in instant noodles and the occasional second-hand bookstore find. It was, in its own way, a sanctuary.

The air conditioning sputtered, a low groan echoing in the cavernous space, and Bart paused in his work, wiping a bead of sweat from his brow. He preferred the early morning shift. The only other soul stirring at this hour was usually old Mrs. Chen, the owner, shuffling around in the kitchen preparing for the lunch rush that rarely came. He preferred it that way. Just him, the echoes of past performances, and the quiet satisfaction of making something clean, even if only for a little while. Today, however, something felt different. A subtle unease, a prickling sensation at the back of his neck, suggested that Monday morning at the Emerald Dragon might be anything but ordinary.
