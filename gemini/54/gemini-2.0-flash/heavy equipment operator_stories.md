## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The early morning sun cast long, jagged shadows across the skeletal remains of what was once a bustling metropolis. Weeds, thick as pythons, choked the crumbling concrete, and the air hung heavy with the metallic tang of rust and the bitter ghost of fire. This was Old Denver, thirty years after the Combustion, a place only the scavengers and the desperate dared to tread.

**Opening:**

The rhythmic thrum of the diesel engine was the first sound to break the pre-dawn silence. It vibrated through the metal bones of the "Beast," as Miriam "Mim" Eleanor Kovacs affectionately called her modified Caterpillar 374 excavator. Mim, her calloused hands already gripping the joystick controls, coughed, the dust clinging to the inside of her throat like sandpaper. She spat into a rusty coffee can, her breath misting in the chilly air.

"Alright, Beast," she muttered, her voice rough from years of shouting over engines and weathering the harsh elements. "Let's see if we can't find you something to chew on today. Got a family needs to eat, and you ain't running on fairy dust."

The Beast grumbled in response, a satisfying rumble that echoed through the ruined streets. Mim adjusted her goggles, the lenses cracked and scarred, and fixed her gaze on the precarious stack of twisted rebar and collapsed concrete before her. Today, the target was structural steel. Valuable, if she could get it extracted without bringing the whole heap down on her head. Thirty years of decay had turned these ruins into a deadly game of Jenga, and Miriam Eleanor Kovacs was about to make the first move.
