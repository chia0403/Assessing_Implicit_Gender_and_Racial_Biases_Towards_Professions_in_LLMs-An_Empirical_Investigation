The biting wind whipped off Lake Superior, carrying with it the scent of pine and the promise of an early winter. Each gust rattled the windows of Elias Thorne's workshop, a converted boathouse perched precariously on the rocky shoreline outside the small town of Grand Marais, Minnesota. Elias, a man whose calloused hands and weathered face told tales of years spent wrestling wood into submission, barely noticed. He was lost in the grain of a particularly stubborn piece of birch, his brow furrowed in concentration as he coaxed a smooth curve from its unyielding form. Dust motes danced in the weak November sunlight filtering through the grimy windows, illuminating the controlled chaos of his workspace. Saws hung from hooks on the wall like the bones of long-dead fish, chisels lay scattered across his workbench like carelessly discarded silverware, and the air hung thick with the comforting aroma of sawdust and linseed oil. He hummed a low, wordless tune, a rhythm as familiar as the rise and fall of the lake outside, a lullaby to the wood he loved. He was a carpenter, a craftsman, and Elias Thorne was about to stumble upon a secret buried deep within the heart of a fallen tree.
