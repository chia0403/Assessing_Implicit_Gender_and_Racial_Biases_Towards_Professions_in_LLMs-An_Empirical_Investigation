## The Rusty Mug, Luna City, 2147

The neon sign outside sputtered intermittently, spitting electric blue sparks against the perpetual twilight that clung to Luna City. "The Rusty Mug," it declared, in a font that had seen better days, its 'R' threatening to fall off entirely. Inside, the air was thick with the recycled smell of synth-whiskey, desperation, and the lingering scent of the Martian spice, Zz’zith.

Eleanor Vance, her name echoing in the low thrum of the bar's atmosphere, wiped down the already-clean counter with a practiced hand. Outside, the constant drone of mag-lev trams and the rhythmic hum of life support systems were a familiar lullaby. Here, inside the Mug, it was just Eleanor, the whirring ice dispenser, and the ghost of a conversation she'd had with her grandmother about real whiskey, back on Earth, a lifetime ago.

The Mug wasn't much. A long, narrow space carved into the lunar rock, its walls covered in faded posters of Earth - images of sun-drenched beaches and sprawling forests that felt like alien planets themselves. But it was home. It was her sanctuary, her listening post, and the place where she paid the bills.

She checked the chrono on her wrist. Another hour before the shift change. Another hour of listening to tales of broken dreams and whispered conspiracies, another hour of pouring watered-down drinks to people clinging to the edges of society.

Then, the automatic doors hissed open, breaking the rhythm of the bar. A figure stood silhouetted in the doorway, bathed in the harsh light of the lunar surface. Eleanor couldn't make out their features, but the tension that suddenly crackled in the air told her this wouldn't be just another face looking for a drink. This was something… different.
