Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring an Emergency Medical Care professional:

**Story Opening:**

The shriek of the radio sliced through the pre-dawn silence of the ambulance bay. Amelia "Amy" Ramirez, already halfway through her lukewarm coffee, flinched and swore under her breath. She slammed the mug down, the ceramic clattering against the stainless steel counter.

“Ambulance 42, respond to a traffic accident. Intersection of Elm and Oak. Reported multiple injuries. Possible entrapment. Dispatch is relaying information to your MDT. Acknowledge.”

Amy grabbed her jacket, its reflective stripes catching the weak glow of the fluorescent lights. She could practically taste the adrenaline already. Traffic accidents before sunrise… always a gamble. You never knew what you were walking into.  She pulled her hair back into a tight ponytail, grabbed her trauma bag and ran toward the waiting ambulance.

"Let's go," she said as she pulled open the driver's side door. "Intersection of Elm and Oak, multiple injuries and entrapment."

**Setting:**

The story primarily takes place in and around the fictional town of Havenwood, nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. Havenwood is a town with a population of approximately 25,000.

*   **Havenwood General Hospital:** A mid-sized regional hospital serving Havenwood and the surrounding rural communities. It has a busy Emergency Department, which frequently sees patients with a wide range of ailments, from minor injuries to critical traumas.

*   **Havenwood EMS Station:** A small, slightly dilapidated building that houses the Havenwood Emergency Medical Services. It's a no-frills environment, but the team that works there is dedicated and passionate.

*   **The Intersection of Elm and Oak:** A fairly busy intersection in the center of Havenwood. A small shopping center with a mix of local businesses, a gas station, and a diner surrounding the corners. The area is usually bustling with early morning commuter traffic.
