The flickering fluorescent bulb in Mrs. Higgins' downstairs toilet buzzed with the frenetic energy of a trapped bee, casting a sickly yellow pall over the scene. Inside, sweat beaded on the forehead of Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins, plumber extraordinaire and, at that particular moment, utter failure. The stubborn U-bend of the toilet stubbornly refused to yield, the rusted metal screeching a mournful protest under his wrench.

Bart straightened, cracking his back and sighing. The air in the tiny bathroom, located in the basement of the Higgins & Sons Funeral Home in the quaint, perpetually overcast town of Harmony Creek, Oregon, was thick with the cloying scent of lilies (likely left over from a recent viewing) and the less pleasant aroma of… well, a blocked toilet. He ran a hand through his already dishevelled brown hair, streaked with unfortunate smudges of unidentified grime.

Harmony Creek wasn't known for its plumbing emergencies, or for much excitement at all, really. The most thrilling event the town usually offered was the annual Pumpkin Festival, and even that was dampened, quite literally, by the ever-present drizzle. But the Higgins & Sons Funeral Home, with its labyrinthine plumbing system dating back to the early 1900s, was a constant source of work for Bart, and today, it had decided to throw him a particularly pungent curveball. This wasn’t just any clogged toilet; this was a plumbing purgatory of epic proportions. And Bartholomew Higgins, humble plumber of Harmony Creek, was about to face his Waterloo in a dimly lit basement bathroom, surrounded by the ghostly echoes of departed souls and the unsettling scent of funeral flowers.
