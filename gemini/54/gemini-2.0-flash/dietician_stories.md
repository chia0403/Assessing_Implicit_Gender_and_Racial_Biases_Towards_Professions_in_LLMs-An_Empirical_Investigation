The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune above Amelia Beatrice Harding, a tune she'd grown intimately familiar with over the past five years. The whirring of the ancient, temperamental air conditioning unit in the corner added a discordant counterpoint. Amelia sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. She’d just finished cleaning the last consultation room, the antiseptic scent stinging her nostrils even after a liberal spritz of lavender air freshener.

The setting was the perpetually underfunded and slightly depressing “Healthy Habits Clinic” located on the outskirts of Harmony, Ohio. Harmony was anything but. A town clinging to the fading glory of its manufacturing past, it was now a landscape of boarded-up storefronts, struggling families, and an abundance of fast-food joints. Healthy Habits, nestled between a discount tyre shop and a pawn broker, felt like a tiny beacon of hope in a sea of despair. It was a place Amelia desperately wanted to make a difference, even if most days it felt like she was fighting a losing battle against fried food, sedentary lifestyles, and deep-seated generational habits.

Amelia, a registered dietician, believed fiercely in the power of good nutrition. She dreamt of transforming Harmony into a bastion of wellness, one kale salad and mindful eating session at a time. Tonight, however, the only thing she felt was bone-tired and acutely aware of the stale coffee smell clinging to her lab coat. She glanced at the overflowing filing cabinet labeled "New Patients - To Process" and knew her fight was just beginning.
