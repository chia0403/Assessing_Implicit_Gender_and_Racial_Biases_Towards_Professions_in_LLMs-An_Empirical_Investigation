Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a story with a drafting worker:

**Setting:**

The year is 1958.  The place: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Specifically, the drafting department of “Superior Steel & Foundry," a sprawling, smoke-stained industrial complex hugging the Monongahela River. The air inside is thick with the smell of graphite, machine oil, and lukewarm coffee. Rows of drafting tables, each illuminated by a harsh, adjustable gooseneck lamp, stretch out across the room, an ordered grid of precision and purpose. Calendars on the wall feature pin-up girls in welding masks and advertisements for slide rules. The constant hum of the ventilation system is punctuated by the rhythmic scratching of pencils on vellum and the occasional barked instruction from the foreman.

**Story Opening:**

Margaret Eleanor "Maggie" Kowalski stared down at the blueprint spread across her drafting table, the delicate lines of a proposed bridge support swimming slightly before her tired eyes. 4:52 PM. Less than ten minutes until quitting time.  She traced a section line with the point of her 4H pencil, wishing the foreman, Mr. Henderson, hadn't insisted on these last-minute revisions. The bridge had been her project for the last six months, and now, on the cusp of completion, he wanted her to re-calculate the stress load on beam B-17 based on… what was it again? Oh, right, Henderson's "gut feeling." Maggie suppressed a sigh.  Gut feelings had no place in structural engineering.  She knew what would happen – she’d spend the next two hours poring over the same equations, proving once again that her original calculations were correct. It always happened.  Being the only woman in the drafting department meant her work was constantly under more scrutiny, her intelligence perpetually questioned, her opinions easily dismissed.  Still, Maggie straightened her shoulders. She wasn't about to give them the satisfaction of seeing her falter. She was a damn good drafter, and this bridge, someday, would stand as a testament to that, even if her name wouldn't be on the plaque. Just the bridge itself. That would be enough. For now.
