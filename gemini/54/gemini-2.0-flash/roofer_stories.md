**Opening:**

Rain, heavy and insistent, hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Mrs. Henderson's porch, a sound that amplified the drumming in Johnathan Michael Riley's temples. He clung to the slippery slope, his gloved fingers white-knuckled around the rusted gutter, and swore under his breath. He hated these kind of jobs. Not because of the work itself, but because they always started the same way: a panicked call from a little old lady whose house was actively disintegrating.

**Setting:**

The setting is a small, almost forgotten town nestled in the Appalachian Mountains of West Virginia, a place where time seemed to move a little slower and the houses wore the scars of generations like proud badges. The town, called Harmony Creek, was once a thriving coal mining community, but the mines had long since closed, leaving behind a legacy of poverty and a population struggling to stay afloat.

Mrs. Henderson's house, perched precariously on a hillside overlooking the creek, was a testament to this struggle. Paint peeled from the weathered clapboard siding, revealing the grey, splintering wood beneath. The porch sagged alarmingly, held together by sheer willpower and an intricate network of climbing ivy. A rusty swing set creaked forlornly in the overgrown yard, a silent reminder of children long grown and gone. The surrounding hills, shrouded in a dense, misty green, seemed to press in on the town, both protecting and suffocating it in their ancient embrace.
