## Story Opening:

The scent of eucalyptus and deep heat hung heavy in the air, a familiar balm against the aches and stresses of Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Ainsworth's day. She kneaded the tight knot in her own shoulder, a perk of the profession she couldn't seem to shake despite years of dedicated stretching. Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of her office, blurring the twinkling city lights below into hazy, impressionistic blobs. It was a particularly miserable Tuesday night, and the last of her patients had gratefully hobbled out hours ago, leaving her alone with the silence and the rhythmic drumming of the storm. Ellie should have left, but something held her back. A prickling unease, a feeling that the quiet was too thick, too pregnant with something unspoken. She shivered, pulling her knitted cardigan tighter around her. Maybe it was just the weather. Or maybe, just maybe, it was the lingering memory of the old woman with the haunted eyes and the story about a shadow that stole her bones...

## Setting:

Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth's chiropractic practice, "Aligned & Well," occupied the entire top floor of a newly renovated office building in downtown Seattle. The modern space was designed to be calming and restorative, a stark contrast to the frantic energy of the city below. Pale wood floors stretched from reception to the treatment rooms, softened by plush, neutral-toned rugs. Sunlight, when Seattle permitted, streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, offering breathtaking views of the Puget Sound and the Olympic Mountains. Tonight, however, the view was obscured by the downpour, the rain turning the city lights into blurry, impressionistic paintings. The main reception area featured comfortable, ergonomic seating and a minimalist aesthetic, punctuated by a large, abstract painting of a spine. Each treatment room was equipped with state-of-the-art adjusting tables and specialized equipment, bathed in soft, adjustable lighting. Overall, the space was designed to evoke a sense of professionalism, serenity, and healing, a sanctuary from the aches and pains of modern life.
