The persistent, high-pitched whine of the Pratt & Whitney R-1830 Twin Wasp engine filled the small cockpit, vibrating through First Lieutenant Evelyn "Eve" Rosewood's teeth. Sweat beaded on her brow despite the chill that seeped through the thin fabric of her flight suit. Below, the vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean stretched out, an endless, rippling tapestry of blue and grey. This was her office today, a B-17 Flying Fortress nicknamed “The Flying Rose,” and the office view was certainly better than anything desk-bound back in Kansas.

It was June of 1944, and Evelyn was tasked with ferrying the bomber from Hawaii to Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. Kwajalein, newly wrested from the Japanese, was buzzing with activity, a crucial staging ground for the island hopping campaign inching its way towards Tokyo. The skies above the atoll, usually crisscrossed with American fighters and bombers, were ominously quiet today. Eve hoped it stayed that way. This wasn’t a combat run; just a delivery. But out here, 800 miles from her destination, you never knew what lurked over the horizon.
