Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a dentist as the main character:

**Story Opening and Setting:**

The hum of the ultrasonic scaler was a hypnotic drone, a white noise that usually soothed Dr. Eleanor “Ellie” Vance. Today, however, it was grating on her nerves like a rusty file against a rotten root. Ellie leaned closer, her magnified glasses pushing against the bridge of her nose, the faint scent of mint toothpaste failing to mask the underlying tang of fear emanating from her patient.

Across the operatory, ten-year-old Billy Henderson was a rigid statue of terror. His knuckles were white where they gripped the armrests, and his eyes, wide and watery, were fixed on a point somewhere above Ellie's head. He'd been a sweet, cooperative kid during the initial exam, chattering about Pokémon and boasting about his loose tooth. But the moment Ellie had introduced the numbing gel, the tide had turned. Now, he was a tiny, quivering volcano threatening to erupt.

"Almost done, Billy," Ellie said, her voice a practiced blend of cheerfulness and reassurance. "Just getting rid of those sugar bugs."

Billy didn't respond.

Ellie sighed internally. She knew the routine. She’d seen it countless times in the bright, sterile confines of Vance Family Dentistry, nestled in the heart of the sleepy, affluent town of Willow Creek, Connecticut. The practice, established by her grandfather, Dr. Silas Vance, had been a pillar of the community for over seventy years. Generations of Willow Creek residents had endured the whine of the drill and the sting of fluoride in these very chairs. And Ellie, carrying on the legacy, felt the weight of that history, and the responsibility of soothing the anxieties of each and every patient, even the ones who looked like they were about to bolt.

The late afternoon sun streamed through the large windows of the operatory, casting long shadows across the pristine white cabinets and the meticulously arranged instruments. Outside, the leaves of the ancient oak tree that stood sentinel over Vance Family Dentistry were just beginning to turn, hinting at the crisp autumn that was on its way. It should have been a peaceful scene, a reminder of the comforting rhythms of life. But inside, in the small world of Billy's fear, Ellie knew she had a bigger battle than just sugar bugs to fight.
