Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a highway worker named Franklin Theodore Montgomery:

**Setting:**

The predawn air hung thick and heavy, smelling of damp asphalt and diesel exhaust. The sky was a bruised purple, barely hinting at the sunrise that was still an hour or so away. Highway 17, snaking through the desolate Nevada desert, was momentarily quiet. The rumble of the overnight trucks had faded, leaving only the whisper of the wind across the scrub brush that clung to the arid landscape. A line of flickering orange cones, spaced precisely ten feet apart, marked the beginning of the day's work zone, casting an eerie, almost theatrical glow on the cracked and sun-baked pavement. Parked just beyond the cones, a battered orange pickup truck, its paint faded and chipped, sat bathed in the pale light of the work site’s generator.

**Opening:**

Franklin Theodore Montgomery coughed, the sound swallowed by the immensity of the desert. He pulled the thermos tighter to his chest, the lukewarm coffee barely offering a respite from the chill that seeped into his bones. Forty-seven years he'd been breathing this air, forty-seven years he'd seen the sun bleed across this same unforgiving landscape. And every damn morning felt exactly the same: cold, lonely, and waiting for the day to grind him down. He stared out at the infinite horizon, a jagged silhouette of mountains against the fading darkness, and sighed. Another day of patching potholes, another day of breathing in dust and fumes, another day of hoping some idiot texting behind the wheel wouldn’t end his life before he made it home to his wife, Carol. He tightened his grip on the thermos. He needed that coffee. And maybe, just maybe, a sign that today wouldn’t be just like every other day.
