Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a fictional animal caretaker:

**Opening:**

The pre-dawn chill clung to the air like a burr to fur as **Isabelle Willow Creek** trudged toward the reptile house. Her breath plumed in the dim, blue light emanating from the emergency generator, a lonely beacon in the vast stillness of the closed zoo. She pulled her worn Carhartt jacket tighter, the familiar scent of sawdust and animal feed clinging to the fabric. "Just another morning," she muttered to the flock of starlings already gathering on the rhino enclosure, "same as always." Except, today felt different. A prickle ran down her spine, a vague unease that resonated with the low hum of the generator and the unsettling quiet of the usually bustling animal kingdom. She fumbled with her keys, the metallic clink echoing in the oppressive silence. Something wasn't right.

**Setting:**

The story is set at the **Oak Haven Zoological Sanctuary**, a mid-sized zoo nestled in the rolling hills of the American Midwest. Oak Haven prides itself on its conservation efforts and naturalistic enclosures. It's a place of lush, carefully cultivated landscapes; from the steamy, dense foliage of the rainforest exhibit to the arid, sun-baked terrain of the desert habitat. Although well-maintained, it's an aging zoo, showing its years in the faded paint of some of the older buildings and the occasional quirky infrastructure issue. The zoo has a few key areas that are crucial to the storyline:

*   **The Reptile House:** Where Isabelle works primarily, is a long, low building made of red brick. Inside, glass enclosures house a diverse collection of snakes, lizards, turtles, and crocodiles, each habitat carefully designed to mimic their natural environment. It is the oldest section of the zoo.
*   **The Aviary:** A huge geodesic dome filled with tropical plants and free-flying birds from all over the world.
*   **The Primate House:** A more modern structure built to simulate a jungle environment, housing several species of monkeys and apes.
*   **The Backstage Areas:** These are the less glamorous but vital areas where the animals are fed, treated, and cared for. Kennels, food prep areas, and veterinarian offices are all found here.

Oak Haven Zoological Sanctuary is more than just a zoo; it's a community, and is about to be the site of more than just a day-to-day routine.
