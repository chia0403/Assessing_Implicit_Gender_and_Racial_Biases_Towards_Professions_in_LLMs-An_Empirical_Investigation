## Story Opening:

The flickering fluorescent lights of the MegaMart cast a sickly yellow glow across the linoleum, highlighting the dust motes dancing in the stale air. Outside, the October wind howled like a banshee, rattling the automatic doors with a ferocity that mirrored the storm brewing in Barry Bartholomew Butterfield's stomach. He adjusted his polyester tie, the garish pattern of leaping dolphins feeling particularly insulting this morning, and plastered a forced smile on his face. Another Saturday. Another day spent convincing perfectly sane individuals that they absolutely *needed* a twelve-piece set of glow-in-the-dark silverware.

**Setting:**

The story opens inside MegaMart, a sprawling, discount retail behemoth located in the bleak, industrial outskirts of Port Blossom, Maine. The store is a symphony of clashing colors, cheap plastic, and blaring Muzak. Aisles stretch as far as the eye can see, overflowing with everything from discounted dog food to knock-off electronics. Barry's assigned territory for the day is the "Home & Kitchen" section, specifically the endcap designated for seasonal promotions and "as seen on TV" gimmicks. The air is thick with the smell of processed food, cleaning chemicals, and the faint, lingering aroma of desperation. Outside, the parking lot is a windswept wasteland of discarded shopping carts and forgotten lottery tickets.
