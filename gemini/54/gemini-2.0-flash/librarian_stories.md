**Setting:** The Dewey Decibel Library, nestled in the quiet, historic district of Havenwood, Maine. It wasn't a grand, modern edifice of glass and steel, but a charming, two-story brick building, its walls softened by climbing ivy and its windows glowing warmly in the evenings. Inside, the air smelled perpetually of old paper, beeswax polish, and a hint of Mrs. Higgins' lavender potpourri, which sat perpetually on the circulation desk. The silence was broken only by the gentle rustle of turning pages, the soft tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the reading room, and the occasional, hushed whispers between patrons.

**Story Opening:**

Eleanor Abigail Blackwood sighed, the sound barely audible above the rhythmic clatter of her keyboard. She was cataloging a donation of antique maps, each one a fragile whisper from a bygone era. Eleanor, Head Librarian of the Dewey Decibel, loved the smell of history, the feel of it beneath her fingertips. But tonight, even the allure of faded cartography couldn't distract her from the unsettling feeling that had been prickling at the back of her neck all day. The library, usually a haven of tranquility, feltâ€¦ off. The shadows in the corners seemed deeper, the silence heavier, the air thick with an unidentifiable energy. Eleanor told herself it was just the approaching full moon, known for its tendency to draw out Havenwood's more eccentric residents, but a persistent unease lingered, a nagging premonition that something extraordinary, and perhaps unwelcome, was about to disrupt the quiet order of her beloved library.
