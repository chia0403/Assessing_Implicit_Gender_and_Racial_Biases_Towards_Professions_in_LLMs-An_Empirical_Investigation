Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a main character who is a judge:

**Opening:**

The gavel echoed, sharp and final, in the cavernous courtroom, a sound that usually brought a sense of resolution. But not today. Not for Judge Eleanor Vance, who stared down at the jury box, the knot in her stomach twisting tighter with each passing second. She'd just pronounced the defendant, a young man barely out of his teens accused of armed robbery, "not guilty." The murmurs erupting from the gallery were a discordant symphony of disbelief, anger, and simmering resentment. Eleanor had expected it; the evidence had been circumstantial, the prosecution's case weak, but still... she couldn’t shake the feeling that justice had somehow been…bent. She hated that feeling.

**Setting:**

The story primarily takes place in the fictional city of Atherton, nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. Atherton is a city of contrasts: pockets of modern prosperity jutting up against ingrained poverty. It's a place where generations have lived and died in the same weathered houses, where tradition clings fiercely to the present, and where the whispers of old secrets still echo through the hollows.

Eleanor's courtroom is located in the Atherton County Courthouse, a grand, if slightly dilapidated, building built in the early 20th century. Its imposing facade of grey stone hides a warren of offices, chambers, and holding cells, all buzzing with the nervous energy of lawyers, defendants, and court staff. The courtroom itself is a somber space, paneled in dark wood and lit by tall, arched windows that offer a view of the bustling city square outside. The atmosphere inside always felt heavy, a weight of expectation and judgement pressing down on everyone within. Eleanor's own chambers are a refuge of sorts, cluttered with law books, family photos, and a perpetually overflowing in-tray, but even here, the weight of her responsibilities is palpable.
