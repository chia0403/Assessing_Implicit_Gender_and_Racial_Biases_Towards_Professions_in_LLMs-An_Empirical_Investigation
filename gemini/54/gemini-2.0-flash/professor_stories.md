## The Obsidian Clock

**Opening:**

The incessant drumming on Professor Alistair Humphrey Thorne's window pane sounded like a tiny, frantic heartbeat. He ignored it. Outside, Edinburgh was choking on a November mist, a greasy fog that clung to the cobblestones and painted the gaslights in halos of sickly yellow. He preferred to focus on the intricate diagram spread before him on his oak desk, the spidery lines and arcane symbols a far more palatable distraction than the encroaching gloom. He'd been chasing this particular thread for weeks, a whisper of forgotten knowledge buried deep within the archives of the university library, and tonight, he was close. He could feel it. The secret to unlocking the true function of the Obsidian Clock, the university's most enigmatic and arguably useless artifact, was shimmering just at the edge of his comprehension. Just one more annotation from the crumbling manuscript… one more connection to be made…

**Setting:**

Professor Alistair Humphrey Thorne’s study was a sanctuary, a testament to a life dedicated to dusty tomes and forgotten lore. Situated on the third floor of a converted townhouse in Edinburgh's New Town, the room was a riot of organized chaos. Shelves overflowing with ancient books, their leather spines cracked and faded, lined the walls from floor to ceiling. Maps, depicting forgotten lands and celestial charts, were tacked haphazardly to the walls, overlapping each other in a colourful tapestry of knowledge. A faint scent of old paper, beeswax polish, and pipe tobacco hung in the air, a comforting aroma that had permeated the room for decades. The focal point was Alistair’s massive oak desk, a sprawling battlefield littered with manuscripts, quill pens, inkwells, magnifying glasses, and half-eaten biscuits. A crackling fire in the hearth provided a meager warmth against the biting Scottish chill, casting dancing shadows across the room and illuminating the countless treasures it held. A single, brass-framed portrait of a stern-faced man with a walrus moustache, presumably a long-deceased ancestor, hung above the fireplace, silently observing the professor's nocturnal pursuits. The entire room exuded an aura of scholarly dedication, a place where the past breathed and secrets waited to be unearthed.
