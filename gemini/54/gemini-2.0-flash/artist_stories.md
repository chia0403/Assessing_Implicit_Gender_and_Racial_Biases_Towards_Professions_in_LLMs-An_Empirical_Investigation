The biting March wind whipped off the choppy waters of the Puget Sound, stinging Eleanor Josephine Vanceâ€™s cheeks as she wrestled with her easel. She had chosen this spot, a craggy outcrop overlooking the Ferry Terminal in Edmonds, specifically for its unforgiving nature. She needed the challenge, the raw energy of the coast mirroring the turmoil within her. The salt-laced air seemed to scrub at her soul, trying to wear away the dull ache that had settled deep in her bones.

The ferry, a lumbering green beast, was just pulling into port, its horn a mournful bellow that echoed off the Olympic Mountains in the distance. Eleanor squinted, trying to capture the light as it glinted off the rain-slicked decks. She was determined to finish this painting, a massive oil on canvas depicting the ferry against the backdrop of the storm-bruised sky. It was supposed to be her masterpiece, the piece that would finally silence the whispers of doubt that had plagued her since art school. But so far, all she had managed was a smear of muddy grey and a gnawing sense of inadequacy.
