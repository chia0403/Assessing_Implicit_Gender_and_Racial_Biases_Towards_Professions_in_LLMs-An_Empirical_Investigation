The biting wind, smelling sharply of salt and diesel, whipped around Elias Thorne's ankles, tugging at the blueprints rolled tightly under his arm. He squinted, his eyes watering, and tightened his grip on the drawings. The sky above Port Lament, a smudge of bruised purple against the churning grey of the North Sea, threatened snow. He hated Port Lament, had hated it since the moment he'd first stepped off the ferry two weeks ago. It was a place of rust and resignation, where buildings sagged like weary shoulders and the cries of gulls echoed the melancholic rhythm of the tide.

But Elias Thorne, architect, was here. Sent here. Banished, he thought, with a bitter twist of his lips, from the sleek glass and steel towers of London to this windswept corner of forgotten England. The commission was his penance, his chance to prove he hadn't lost his touch, hadn't succumbed to the siren song of easy money and derivative design.

The address, scribbled on a faded piece of paper, led him past boarded-up storefronts and crumbling brick buildings. Finally, he reached it: a Victorian-era sanatorium perched precariously on the edge of the cliffs. The grey stone edifice, once a beacon of hope for tuberculosis patients, was now a desolate skeleton, its windows gaping like empty eye sockets. This, Elias thought, shivering not just from the cold, was where his redemption would begin. This was the Port Lament Sanatorium, and this was his canvas.
