The cab of the Peterbilt 379 rumbled like a contented metal beast, a low thrum vibrating through Amelia "Ace" Blackwood's worn leather boots. Dawn was painting the Nevada desert in hues of bruised purple and burnt orange, the kind of sunrise that made even the desolate stretches of Highway 50, the so-called "Loneliest Road in America," feel almost majestic.  Ace, her dark hair pulled back in a tight braid, nursed a lukewarm cup of coffee, the radio tuned to a crackling AM station broadcasting out of Ely. Her rig, affectionately nicknamed "The Queen of Spades" after its black paint job and stylized spade decal, was hauling a load of copper piping from a mine near Eureka, destined for a construction site in Reno. The desert stretched out around her, a vast expanse of scrub brush and sand, punctuated by the occasional jagged peak, silent and watchful under the burgeoning light. The air, crisp and cool at this altitude, carried the faint, metallic tang of sagebrush and the low hum of the Queen's powerful engine as Ace pushed on, another day, another mile eaten up on the endless ribbon of asphalt.
