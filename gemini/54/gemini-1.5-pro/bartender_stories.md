Rain lashed against the stained-glass windows of The Gilded Lily, blurring the neon sign's reflection into a shimmering mess on the slick cobblestones outside. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of stale beer, cheap perfume, and the faint, metallic tang of blood orange bitters.  Behind the mahogany bar, Elias Thorne, his face etched with the weary wisdom of a thousand late-night confessions, polished a highball glass with a practiced hand. The Lily, nestled in a forgotten alley of Old Providence, was his sanctuary, his kingdom, and his prison, all rolled into one.  Tonight, however, felt different. The usual hum of hushed conversations and clinking glasses was replaced by a tense, expectant silence, punctuated only by the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock in the corner.  Elias had a feeling this was the calm before a particularly nasty storm.
