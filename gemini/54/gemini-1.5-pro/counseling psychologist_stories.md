The rain hammered against the arched window of Dr. Elias Thorne's office, each drop a tiny explosion against the aged glass.  His office, nestled in a converted Victorian house on the edge of the historic district of Ashworth, Massachusetts, usually offered a calming view of sprawling oak trees and manicured lawns. Today, however, the deluge obscured everything beyond the porch, turning the world outside into a blurry, grey canvas.  The only other illumination in the room came from a Tiffany lamp on his mahogany desk, casting a warm, amber glow that struggled to combat the encroaching gloom.  The air hung heavy with the scent of old books and the faint, lingering aroma of Elias's afternoon Earl Grey tea. He sat in his worn leather armchair, the rhythmic ticking of a grandfather clock in the corner a counterpoint to the relentless drumming of the rain, waiting for his next patient.
