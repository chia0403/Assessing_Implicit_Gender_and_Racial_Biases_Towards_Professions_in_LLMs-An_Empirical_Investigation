The biting February wind whipped off the East River, stinging Anastasia "Ana" Volkov's cheeks as she surveyed the scene.  Abandoned warehouses loomed like skeletal giants against the bruised twilight sky of Brooklyn.  Rusting cranes groaned in the distance, their mournful cries echoing across the desolate waterfront. Ana, bundled in a thick parka that swallowed her petite frame, pulled her knitted beanie further down over her ears.  This was it. The perfect setting for the gritty, urban thriller she’d been meticulously planning for the last two years. "The Lazarus Gambit."  Her magnum opus.  A film so raw and visceral, it would finally solidify her place amongst the cinematic greats.  At least, that’s what she hoped. The pressure was immense, a knot tightening in her stomach with every gust of icy wind.  This location, stark and unforgiving, mirrored the desperation at the heart of her story. And, if she was being completely honest with herself, the desperation she felt to prove everyone wrong.  To prove that a woman, a Russian immigrant no less, could make a film that would shake Hollywood to its core.
