The revolving brass doors of the Grand Majestic Hotel sighed open, admitting a gust of frigid Chicago wind that chased Cornelius "Corny" O'Malley deeper into the plush, overheated lobby. Snowflakes, fat and lazy, danced on the icy air before melting on the Persian rug, leaving dark, fleeting stains. Corny, his pillbox hat perched precariously on his head, shivered, despite the thick wool of his uniform.  January in the Windy City was proving particularly blustery this year, and the warmth radiating from the enormous fireplace at the far end of the lobby felt miles away. The Grand Majestic, a relic of a bygone era of opulence and excess, boasted marble floors that gleamed under the chandelier’s crystal glow, walls adorned with oil paintings of stern-faced men and women, and an air of hushed reverence, broken only by the occasional muffled cough or the clinking of ice in a distant cocktail shaker. Tonight, however, a buzz of anticipation hung in the air, thicker than the usual cigar smoke that clung to the velvet drapes. The Chicago Symphony Orchestra’s annual gala was due to start in an hour, and the lobby was beginning to fill with the city’s elite, their furs and jewels glittering like captured stars. Corny adjusted his white gloves, ready for the onslaught.  This was his domain, his stage, and he, Cornelius O'Malley, was the star bellhop.
