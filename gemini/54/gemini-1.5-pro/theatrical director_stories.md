The biting November wind whipped around Esmeralda "Esme" Cartwright, swirling fallen leaves into frenzied dervishes across the cobbled courtyard of the dilapidated St. Jude's Theatre.  Built in 1788, the theatre clung precariously to the edge of Spitalfields Market in London, its once-grand facade now obscured by scaffolding and a tangle of overflowing skips brimming with debris.  The scent of damp plaster and decay hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the vibrant aromas of spices and street food wafting from the nearby market stalls.  Esme, bundled in a thick wool coat and a vibrant fuchsia scarf that defied the grey skies, surveyed the scene with a mixture of apprehension and fierce determination. This was it.  Her chance. To resurrect not just a forgotten theatre, but a piece of her own history.
