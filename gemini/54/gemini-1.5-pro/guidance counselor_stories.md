The fluorescent lights of Northwood High hummed a monotonous B-flat, a counterpoint to the chaotic symphony of slamming locker doors and adolescent chatter echoing through the linoleum-tiled hallway.  October sunlight, weak and watery, filtered through the grimy windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air.  Ms. Eleanor Vance, her nameplate proclaiming her title as "Guidance Counselor," sighed and rubbed the bridge of her nose. Her office, a cramped space crammed with college pamphlets and motivational posters featuring kittens clinging precariously to branches, offered little respite from the frenetic energy outside. The air smelled faintly of stale coffee and teenage desperation, a familiar aroma that clung to her like a second skin.  This Tuesday morning felt particularly ominous. A robin had flown into her kitchen window earlier, leaving a feathery smear across the glass.  Eleanor, ever the pragmatist, had cleaned it up without a second thought, but a prickle of unease remained.  She had a feeling this day was going to be anything but ordinary.
