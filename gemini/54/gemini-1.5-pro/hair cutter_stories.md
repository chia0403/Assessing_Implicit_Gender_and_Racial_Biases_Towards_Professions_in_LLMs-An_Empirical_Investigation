The rusty scissors, cool and familiar in Elias Finch's hand, snicked rhythmically, punctuated by the soft hiss of hair falling onto the checkered linoleum floor.  Elias’s Barbershop occupied a sliver of a building squeezed between a laundromat humming with the vibrations of a thousand spins and a perpetually dim sum restaurant that exuded the faint, sweet aroma of char siu. Situated on Bleecker Street, just far enough from the tourist throngs that choked Greenwich Village, the shop was a sanctuary of quiet in the bustling city. Sunlight streamed through the large front window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and highlighting the worn, leather chairs lining the wall.  A vintage radio, perched on a shelf crammed with dusty tonics and faded photographs, crooned a melancholic jazz tune, setting the tempo for Elias’s precise movements. Outside, the cacophony of New York City thrummed on, oblivious to the quiet drama unfolding within the barbershop's walls.
