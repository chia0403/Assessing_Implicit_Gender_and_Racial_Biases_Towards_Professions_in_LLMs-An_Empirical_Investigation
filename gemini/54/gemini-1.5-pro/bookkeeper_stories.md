The frosted breath of Amelia Prudence Higgins plumed in the air as she hurried across the cobbled lane, her ledger book clutched tight beneath her thick woolen shawl.  Fog, thick as porridge, clung to the gas lamps of Grimsborough, blurring the already indistinct outlines of the crooked Tudor houses that lined Pennyfeather Street. The year was 1888, and a chill deeper than November had settled over the small Yorkshire town, a chill that permeated the very stones and whispered of secrets best left undisturbed. Amelia, however, was far too preoccupied with the discrepancies in Mr. Grimshaw's accounts to notice anything other than the persistent sixpence that refused to balance.  Her destination, Grimshaw's Emporium, loomed before her, a two-story building with peeling paint and a perpetually dusty window displaying an assortment of moth-eaten taxidermy and chipped porcelain dolls. It was a place that held the unsettling air of forgotten memories, much like the town itself.
