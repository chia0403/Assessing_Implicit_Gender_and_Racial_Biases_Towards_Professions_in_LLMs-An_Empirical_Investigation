Rain lashed against the ornate, bay windows of Amelia Grace Hawthorne's office, blurring the already fading light of the late November afternoon.  The rhythmic drumming of water against glass, usually a soothing sound to Amelia, tonight only amplified the gnawing unease in her stomach. Her office, nestled high on the fifteenth floor of the Grimshaw Building, normally offered a panoramic view of the Chicago skyline, but tonight the city was shrouded in a thick, grey mist, swallowing the twinkling lights and towering skyscrapers whole.  Stacks of meticulously organized files lined her mahogany desk, each a testament to Amelia's precision and dedication to her work at Prescott & Sterling, one of the oldest and most prestigious accounting firms in the city.  A half-eaten turkey sandwich sat forgotten on a china plate, the cranberry sauce congealing into a ruby-red blob.  Amelia, usually a stickler for tidiness, hadn't even noticed.  Something was amiss, something beyond a simple imbalance in the quarterly reports.
