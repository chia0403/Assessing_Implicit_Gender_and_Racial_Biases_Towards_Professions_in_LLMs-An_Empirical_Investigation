Rain lashed against the arched windows of Beatrice "Bea" Aurelia Finch's attic apartment, a relentless drumming that mirrored the throbbing headache pounding behind her eyes.  The Parisian skyline, usually a romantic tapestry of lights twinkling against the indigo dusk, was obscured by a curtain of grey.  Inside, the only illumination came from the emerald green banker's lamp perched precariously on a stack of manuscripts, casting long, distorted shadows across the cluttered room.  Empty coffee cups littered every surface, interspersed with overflowing ashtrays and teetering piles of books. Bea, clad in an oversized cashmere cardigan that had seen better days, sat hunched over her ancient typewriter, a single finger hovering over a particularly stubborn key.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale cigarette smoke, cheap instant coffee, and the faintly musty aroma of aging paper â€“ the perfume of a deadline.  Tonight, that deadline was for the memoirs of a notoriously difficult former opera singer, a woman whose vibrato could shatter glass and whose temperament could curdle milk. Bea sighed, the sound swallowed by the storm raging outside.  This was going to be a long night.
