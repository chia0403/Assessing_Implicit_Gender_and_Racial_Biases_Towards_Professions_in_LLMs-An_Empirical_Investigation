The biting November wind whipped Dr. Elias Thorne's dark hair across his face as he stared at the scene unfolding before him.  Yellow police tape fluttered in the gale, cordoning off a small, frost-covered playground in the heart of Grimsborough, a town otherwise known for its quaint Victorian architecture and charming tea rooms.  A swing set creaked rhythmically, the only sound besides the wind and the hushed murmurs of the uniformed officers huddled together for warmth.  The frosted metal of the slide glinted under the harsh glare of the portable floodlights, illuminating a disturbing tableau: a child's brightly coloured scarf lay abandoned at the bottom, a splash of vibrant defiance against the otherwise bleak and frozen landscape.  Elias, his breath clouding the frigid air, adjusted his gloves and stepped under the tape, his mind already working, piecing together the fragments of a story yet untold.
