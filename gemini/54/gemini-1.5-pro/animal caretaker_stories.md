Frost crunched beneath her heavy, insulated boots, the sound swallowed by the mournful howl of Chinook, the sanctuary's resident timber wolf, lamenting the encroaching winter. Northwood was nestled deep in the Adirondack Mountains of upstate New York, a haven for injured and orphaned wildlife, a place Mia had called home for the last five years, and loved with a fierce, protective loyalty. The scent of pine needles, damp earth, and the faint, ever-present aroma of hay and animal feed hung heavy in the crisp air.  The sanctuary buildings, a collection of weathered wooden structures and sturdy metal enclosures, huddled together against the elements, offering a promise of warmth and the comforting sounds of rustling straw and contented snuffles.
