The velvet curtain, heavy with the weight of anticipation, shimmered under the single spotlight.  A hush, thick as London fog on a November night, blanketed the Grand Majestic Theatre.  Backstage, Elara Nightingale, her heart a hummingbird trapped in her ribs, adjusted the silver filigree comb in her raven hair.  Her emerald green gown, shimmering with tiny beads, pooled around her ankles. Tonight was the culmination of years of tireless practice, whispered dreams, and unwavering dedication.  Tonight, Elara would either cement her place as a rising star or fade into the chorus of forgotten hopefuls.  The air was thick with the scent of dust, old wood, and the ghostly perfume of countless performers who had graced this stage before her.  London, outside the theatre doors, hummed with its usual symphony of car horns and distant sirens, oblivious to the potential history being made within the Grand Majestic's gilded walls.
