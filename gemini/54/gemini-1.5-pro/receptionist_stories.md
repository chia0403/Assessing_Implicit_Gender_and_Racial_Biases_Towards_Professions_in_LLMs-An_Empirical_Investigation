The insistent chirping of the ancient intercom, affectionately nicknamed "Chirpy" by Elara Jane Holloway, sliced through the otherwise tranquil hum of the Aquamarine Dreams Aquarium.  Sunlight, filtered through the gargantuan main tank, painted shifting patterns of turquoise and emerald across Elara's pristine white desk. Situated in the lobby, a circular space dominated by a bubbling fountain shaped like a breaching humpback whale, her desk was the first – and often last – bastion of civilization for visitors to this watery world.  Outside, the Florida heat shimmered off the asphalt, but inside, the air conditioning fought a losing battle against the perpetual humidity that clung to everything like a curious octopus. Elara, with her flawlessly coiffed auburn bun and a smile that could charm a shoal of piranhas, prepared for the next wave of wide-eyed children and sunburnt tourists, another Wednesday morning at the aquarium unfolding before her.
