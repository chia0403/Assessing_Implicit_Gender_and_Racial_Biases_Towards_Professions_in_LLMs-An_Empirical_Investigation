The crisp October air, scented with woodsmoke and decaying leaves, nipped at Dr. Elias Thorne's cheeks as he unlocked the door to his clinic.  "Thorne Physical Therapy & Rehabilitation" proclaimed the frosted glass in elegant script above the brass handle. Situated on the edge of Hollow Creek, a small town nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, the clinic was a converted Victorian house, painted a cheerful, if slightly faded, butter yellow. Inside, the scent of antiseptic mingled with the lingering aroma of cinnamon from the diffuser Elias had left on over the weekend.  Sunlight streamed through the large bay windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and glinting off the polished wooden floors.  Elias, his breath fogging slightly in the cool air, switched on the lights, chasing away the lingering shadows and preparing for another week of helping his patients reclaim their strength and mobility. The stillness was broken only by the rhythmic ticking of the grandfather clock in the waiting room, a comforting presence that had witnessed generations of Hollow Creek residents pass through its doors.
