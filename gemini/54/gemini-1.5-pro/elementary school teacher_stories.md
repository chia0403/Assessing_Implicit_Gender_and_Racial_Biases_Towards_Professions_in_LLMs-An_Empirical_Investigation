The late afternoon sun, filtered through the dusty blinds of Mrs. Eleanor Vance's third-grade classroom, cast long stripes across the worn linoleum floor.  Room 3B at Maplewood Elementary, nestled in the sleepy, sycamore-lined streets of Oakhaven, Ohio, was usually a vibrant hub of activity.  Construction paper creations clung precariously to every available surface, and a faint aroma of Elmer's glue perpetually hung in the air.  But today, a Tuesday in early October, the room felt oddly still.  The miniature chairs were stacked neatly atop the low tables, and the colorful alphabet border above the chalkboard seemed to droop with exhaustion.  Only Eleanor remained, perched on the edge of her desk, a half-eaten apple resting beside a stack of ungraded spelling tests.  The silence, broken only by the distant hum of the school custodian's vacuum cleaner, was unsettling.  It felt, to Eleanor, like the quiet before a storm.
