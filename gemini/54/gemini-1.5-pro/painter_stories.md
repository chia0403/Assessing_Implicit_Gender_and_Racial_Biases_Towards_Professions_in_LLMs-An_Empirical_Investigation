The salt-laced wind whipped through the narrow cobbled streets of Port Blossom, tugging at the edges of Eliza Jane Hawthorne's canvas. It was perched precariously on a rickety easel, overlooking the bustling harbour where fishing boats bobbed like brightly coloured corks.  The late afternoon sun, a hazy apricot in the smog-tinged sky, cast long shadows across the scene, turning the vibrant hulls of the boats into streaks of molten gold and crimson. Eliza, bundled in a thick, charcoal-grey shawl despite the lingering summer warmth, squinted, her brow furrowed in concentration.  She dipped her brush into a blob of cerulean blue, then hesitated, her gaze flitting between the palette and the canvas, searching for the precise shade to capture the restless shimmer of the sea.  Port Blossom, with its ramshackle charm and ever-changing light, was both her muse and her torment. It was a place of breathtaking beauty, a place she desperately loved, but also a place that stubbornly refused to be truly captured on canvas.
