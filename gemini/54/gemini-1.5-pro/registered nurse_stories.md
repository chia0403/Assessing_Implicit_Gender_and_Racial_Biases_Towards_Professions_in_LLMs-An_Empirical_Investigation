The biting November wind whipped Amelia Reyes, RN,  across the deserted parking lot of St. Jude's Community Hospital.  Fluorescent lights buzzed through the grimy windows of the ER, casting a sickly yellow glow onto the freshly fallen snow.  Amelia hunched deeper into her worn parka, the collar scratching against her cheek.  Rural Vermont wasn't known for its mild winters, and tonight felt particularly brutal.  The mountains surrounding the small town of Havenwood were shrouded in a thick, swirling fog, swallowing the last vestiges of twilight.  Amelia shivered, not entirely from the cold, and pulled her ID badge from beneath her jacket, swiping it against the locked staff entrance.  A click echoed in the stillness, and the heavy door swung inwards, revealing the chaotic warmth of the emergency room beyond.  The usual controlled chaos had escalated into something more frenzied; the air thick with the scent of antiseptic, sweat, and a low, persistent hum of anxiety.
