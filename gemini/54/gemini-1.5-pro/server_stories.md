The flickering neon sign of the Stardust Diner cast a lurid, cherry-red glow across the rain-slicked asphalt of Highway 17. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of frying onions, stale coffee, and desperation.  Eleanor Vance, her name tag slightly askew on her faded turquoise uniform, wiped down the sticky Formica countertop with a practiced, circular motion. It was 11:47 pm on a Tuesday, and the only other occupants of the diner were a truck driver nursing a lukewarm cup of joe and a couple arguing in hushed tones over a half-eaten plate of fries. The rhythmic whoosh of passing cars punctuated the silence, each vehicle a fleeting promise of escape from the monotony of Eleanor's life in the forgotten corner of Harmony Creek, Nevada.  The bell above the door chimed, its cheerful jingle jarring in the otherwise desolate atmosphere.  Eleanor plastered on a weary smile, expecting the usual late-night stragglers. What she didn't expect was the man who walked in, shrouded in shadow and smelling faintly of ozone and rain.
