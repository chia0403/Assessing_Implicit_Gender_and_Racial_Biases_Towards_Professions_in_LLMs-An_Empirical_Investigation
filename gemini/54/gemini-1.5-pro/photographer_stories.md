The salt-laced wind whipped Amelia "Mia" Reyes's dark hair across her face, momentarily obscuring the viewfinder of her vintage Rolleiflex camera.  She squinted, pushing the stray strands back with a calloused thumb, the biting November air a stark contrast to the warmth radiating from the thermos of coffee clutched in her other hand. Below her, the fishing village of Port Blossom, Maine, clung to the rocky coastline like barnacles to a hull.  Its brightly painted houses, usually vibrant jewels against the steely Atlantic, were muted beneath a pre-dawn gloom, the only signs of life the flickering gaslights in a handful of windows and the distant thrum of a lobster boat heading out to sea.  Mia, perched on the windswept cliffs overlooking the harbour, inhaled deeply, the mingled scents of brine, pine, and damp earth filling her lungs. This was her favourite time of day, that liminal space between darkness and dawn, where the world held its breath, waiting for the sun's first kiss.  She'd come to Port Blossom seeking solace, a quiet escape from the clamorous world of New York fashion photography, and in the two weeks she’d been there, she’d found a different kind of beauty, a raw, untamed energy that resonated deep within her soul.
