The biting November wind whipped at Captain Elias Thorne's turnout coat as he stood on the rooftop of the derelict Larkin Textile Mill, watching embers dance against the pre-dawn sky.  Below him, the five-story brick behemoth glowed an angry orange, the heart of the fire churning deep within its belly.

Acrid smoke stung Elias's eyes and the roar of the flames was a constant, deafening pulse in his ears.  He adjusted his helmet, the beam of his headlamp cutting through the swirling smoke to illuminate the faces of his crew, their expressions grim reflections of his own.  This wasn't just another fire.  This one felt personal.
