The whir of the stand mixer was a comforting lullaby to Amelia "Millie" Reyes.  Vanilla buttercream, the foundation of most of her creations, billowed up the sides of the stainless steel bowl, its sweet scent permeating the tiny, sun-drenched kitchen of "Butterflies & Batter." Located in the heart of the whimsical seaside town of Seabrook, Millie's bakery was a kaleidoscope of pastel colours, mismatched china, and the constant aroma of baking magic. Seabrook, with its brightly painted Victorian houses, quirky shops, and the ever-present salty tang of the ocean air, was the perfect backdrop for Millie’s whimsical cake creations.  This morning, however, the usual cheerful atmosphere was tinged with a nervous anticipation. Today was the annual Seabrook Sandcastle Festival, and Millie had been commissioned to create the centerpiece cake – a five-tiered replica of the town's historic lighthouse.
