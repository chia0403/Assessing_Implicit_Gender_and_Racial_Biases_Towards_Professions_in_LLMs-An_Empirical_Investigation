Rain lashed against the stained-glass window depicting Saint Jude, patron saint of lost causes, and Amelia Reyes, OTR/L, shivered despite the crackling fire in her hearth.  Her small cottage, nestled amidst the windswept dunes of Cape Cod, usually offered a sanctuary from the November gales, but tonight, the storm seemed intent on breaching its defenses.  The rhythmic crash of waves against the shore, usually a lullaby, now sounded like a mournful dirge.  Amelia, still in her work clothes – sensible navy trousers and a cream-colored sweater – stirred a mug of chamomile tea, the scent doing little to soothe the knot of unease tightening in her stomach.  Her last patient of the day, a young boy with cerebral palsy named Leo, had made remarkable progress, yet Amelia couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss. It wasn't related to Leo's therapy, it was something colder, something closer to home. The flickering light from the fire danced on the worn, wooden floorboards, casting long, distorted shadows that seemed to writhe and shift with a life of their own.  The insistent chime of her phone cut through the silence, the caller ID flashing an unknown number.
