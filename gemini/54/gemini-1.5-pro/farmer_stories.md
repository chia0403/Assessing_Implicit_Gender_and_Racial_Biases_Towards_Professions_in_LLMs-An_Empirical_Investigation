The biting wind whipped across the vast, flat expanse of the Saskatchewan prairie, stinging Elias Thatcher's cheeks and turning his nose a painful shade of crimson.  The sky, a bruised purple streaked with angry orange, promised a blizzard before nightfall.  Elias, his weathered hands tucked deep into the pockets of his worn sheepskin coat, surveyed his fields.  Rows of dormant wheat stalks, brittle and brown beneath a dusting of early snow, stretched towards the horizon, where they met the skeletal silhouettes of leafless poplars bordering his property.  The Thatcher farm, a collection of sturdy, if somewhat ramshackle, buildings huddled together against the elements, stood as a solitary beacon against the vast, unforgiving landscape.  The year was 1934, the heart of the Dust Bowl, and the prairie, once a promise of prosperity, was now a crucible of hardship.  This year, more than most,  Elias felt the weight of his family's legacy, etched in every furrow and fence post, pressing down on him like the darkening sky.
