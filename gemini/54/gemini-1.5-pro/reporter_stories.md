Rain lashed against the grimy windows of The Sentinel's office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Amelia "Millie" Reyes.  Fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the cluttered desks and overflowing ashtrays.  Cigarette smoke hung thick in the air, a stale perfume mingling with the scent of cheap coffee and deadline desperation.
