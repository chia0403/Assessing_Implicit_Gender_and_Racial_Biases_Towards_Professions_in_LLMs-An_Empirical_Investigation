The biting wind whipped off the North Atlantic, rattling the windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's veterinary clinic and sending a shiver down his spine.  The "clinic" was a glorified shed tucked between the craggy cliffs and the churning grey sea on the remote island of Ailsa Craig, a volcanic plug jutting out of the Firth of Clyde.  Elias, his breath misting in the frigid air, stared out at the tempestuous waters, a mug of lukewarm tea clutched between his chapped hands.  The only sounds were the shriek of the wind, the relentless battering of waves against the rocky shore, and the faint bleating of a lamb from the makeshift pen he'd set up inside.  It was lambing season, the busiest time of year for a vet on this isolated, windswept isle, and Elias hadn't slept properly in days.  The flickering gas lamp cast long shadows across the worn wooden floor, highlighting the clutter of syringes, bandages, and well-thumbed veterinary textbooks.  Ailsa Craig, with its population of gannets outnumbering humans a thousand to one, was a harsh and unforgiving place, but it was home.  And for Elias Thorne, it was where he belonged.
