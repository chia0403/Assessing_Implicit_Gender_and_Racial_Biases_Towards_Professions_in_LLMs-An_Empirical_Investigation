Rain lashed against the windows of "Nourish," Genevieve Ashworth's small dietetics practice, mimicking the churning anxiety in her stomach. The quaint, pastel-yellow building, nestled between a bustling bakery and a perpetually gloomy antique shop on Sycamore Street, usually filled Genevieve with a sense of calm purpose. This Tuesday, however, the cheerful daffodils wilting in their window boxes seemed to mirror her own drooping spirits. The appointment scheduled for 9 am – a new client referred by Dr. Ramirez, the town's notoriously enigmatic cardiologist – had Genevieve on edge. Dr. Ramirez’s referrals were always… complicated.  The aroma of cinnamon and sugar from the bakery next door, usually a comforting scent, today only amplified the unsettling quiet before the storm that she sensed brewing within the walls of Nourish.
