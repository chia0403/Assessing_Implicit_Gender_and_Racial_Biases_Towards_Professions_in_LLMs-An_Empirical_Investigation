The crisp October air, scented with woodsmoke and decaying leaves, nipped at Dr. Elias Thorne’s cheeks as he unlocked the door to Thorne Chiropractic.  His breath puffed out in small white clouds, momentarily obscuring the hand-painted sign above the entrance that depicted a spine blissfully straightening itself.  Located on the sleepy main street of Harmony Creek, Vermont, a town more populated by maple trees than people, the clinic resided in a converted Victorian farmhouse, painted a cheerful, if slightly faded, butter yellow.  Inside, the waiting room’s hardwood floors gleamed under the warm glow of antique lamps, offering a cozy contrast to the deepening twilight outside.  A fire crackled merrily in the hearth, casting flickering shadows on the worn, floral-patterned armchairs.  Elias, his shoulders already aching in anticipation of a long day hunched over patients, flipped on the string of fairy lights draped around the large bay window, their soft twinkle adding to the overall sense of tranquility.  He had a feeling it was going to be anything but.
