The biting Alaskan wind whipped at Amelia "Ace" Reyes's flight suit as she prepped her De Havilland Beaver, the "Arctic Fox," for takeoff.  Snow crunched under her boots, the pristine white expanse of Lake Hood stretching before her, a vast, frozen mirror reflecting the pale dawn sky.  Anchorage, Alaska, still slumbered under a blanket of snow, the city lights twinkling faintly in the distance.  Breath plumed from Ace's lips as she checked the magnetos one last time, the scent of aviation fuel sharp in the frigid air.  This morning's flight was a routine cargo run to a remote mining outpost nestled deep within the Wrangell Mountains, a flight she'd made hundreds of times.  But something about the stillness of the air, the almost unnatural quiet that blanketed the usually bustling lake, prickled at the back of her neck.  It felt like the world was holding its breath, waiting for something to happen.
