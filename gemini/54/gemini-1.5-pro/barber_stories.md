The flickering neon sign of "Alphonse Peretti's Tonsorial Parlour" cast a lurid, purplish glow on the rain-slicked streets of New Birmingham.  The city, a sprawling metropolis built on the bones of old steel mills and now dominated by gleaming chrome skyscrapers, rarely slept. But on this Tuesday night, just past 2:00 am, even the persistent hum of hover-traffic had subsided to a low drone. Inside the warm, wood-panelled shop, Alphonse Peretti himself, a man whose precisely trimmed mustache rivalled his precisely honed straight razors, was sweeping up clipped hairs, the only sound the rhythmic swish of bristles on linoleum.  A single, bare bulb illuminated the vintage barber chair, its worn leather gleaming like a dark ruby in the otherwise dim shop. Rain lashed against the large front window, momentarily obscuring the reflection of Alphonseâ€™s tired but resolute face. He had one more appointment, a late one, and something about it prickled his usually unflappable demeanor.
