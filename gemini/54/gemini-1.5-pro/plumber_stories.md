The biting November wind whipped around Beatrice "Bea" Kowalski, snagging at the edges of her thick canvas overalls and whistling a mournful tune through the skeletal branches of the elm tree that overshadowed number 27 Sycamore Crescent. Sycamore Crescent itself was a testament to faded suburban glory.  Once a picture of aspirational 1950s neatness, it now wore a patina of gentle neglect.  Lawns were overgrown, paint peeled on window frames, and more than a few of the identical boxy houses sported boarded-up windows like missing teeth. Number 27 was no exception, its brickwork stained with damp and the porch sagging precariously under a weight of forgotten terracotta plant pots.  Bea, however, viewed it with a professional eye, her toolbox already clinking faintly in anticipation.  This wasn't just another leaky faucet; this was a symphony of plumbing disasters waiting to be conducted by her capable hands.
