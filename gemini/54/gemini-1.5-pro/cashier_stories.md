The fluorescent lights of the Quick Stop, a 24-hour convenience store nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed-down bowling alley, hummed a monotonous B flat.  Rain lashed against the single, grimy window, blurring the neon "Open" sign into a fuzzy halo.  Inside, the air hung thick with the mingled scents of stale coffee, day-old hot dogs, and the faintly floral disinfectant Esme Aisling Mahoney used religiously to wipe down the counter. Esme, with her nametag slightly askew on her faded blue polo shirt, tapped her chipped, cherry-red fingernails against the worn scanner, her gaze fixed on the flickering clock above the cigarette display. 2:57 AM. Three more minutes until her shift ended, three more minutes until she could escape the oppressive stillness of the night and walk home beneath the sodium-vapor glow of the streetlights. Three minutes that felt like an eternity.
