The bell above the door of "Nailed It" tinkled a discordant melody, announcing the arrival of yet another desperate soul seeking salvation for their chipped, neglected nails.  Rain lashed against the large front window, blurring the neon glow of the "Open" sign into a hazy smear. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of acetone and something vaguely floral, a scent Amelia Grace Hawthorne, proprietor and sole manicurist, had long since ceased to notice. Nailed It occupied a narrow sliver of real estate sandwiched between a laundromat and a perpetually closed-down bakery on Bleecker Street in Manhattan.  Despite its less-than-glamorous location, Amelia had poured her heart, soul, and meager savings into transforming the space into a haven of pampering, albeit a slightly cramped one.  Velvet-upholstered chairs lined one wall, facing a row of gleaming white manicure stations.  A small, bubbling fountain gurgled contentedly in the corner, a futile attempt to drown out the rhythmic thump of the washing machines next door.  This Tuesday afternoon, however, the only sound louder than the rain and the churning laundry was the frantic tapping of Ameliaâ€™s own acrylics against her phone screen as she scrolled through Instagram, searching for nail art inspiration that might just spark some joy in this dreary day.
