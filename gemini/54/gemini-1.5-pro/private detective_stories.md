Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of Silas Blackwood's office, a staccato rhythm accompanying the mournful wail of a distant foghorn.  The office, nestled above a dimly lit pawn shop on Grimshaw Street, San Francisco, smelled perpetually of stale cigarettes and cheap whiskey – a scent Silas himself, despite his best efforts, seemed to exude.  He sat hunched over his desk, a chipped mug of lukewarm coffee cradled in his large, calloused hands.  The flickering neon sign of the pawn shop below cast a lurid green glow through the grimy window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and glinting off the brass knuckles perched precariously on a stack of case files.  Silas "Rip" Blackwood, a man as weathered and worn as the city he served, stared at the blurred photograph of a missing woman, her painted smile mocking him from the glossy surface.  It was the kind of case he usually avoided - domestic disputes rarely ended well, and even less frequently paid well. But something in the woman’s eyes, a flicker of fear beneath the forced cheer, had tugged at him.  And right now, with the rent overdue and the refrigerator echoing its emptiness, Silas wasn't in a position to be picky.
