The relentless wail of the siren sliced through the humid Florida night, a familiar counterpoint to the rhythmic thump of the windshield wipers battling the torrential downpour.  Palm trees bent double under the onslaught of the wind, their fronds lashing against the ambulance like frantic, grasping hands. Inside, Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez, EMT-Paramedic, gripped the handrail, her knuckles white. Her partner, Marco Diaz, navigated the flooding streets of Miami, his jaw tight with concentration.  The dispatcher's voice crackled over the radio, painting a grim picture: a multi-vehicle collision on the MacArthur Causeway, likely involving fatalities. Amy felt the familiar knot of dread tighten in her stomach, but years of experience had taught her to compartmentalize.  Tonight, like every other night, her focus had to be razor sharp. Lives depended on it.
