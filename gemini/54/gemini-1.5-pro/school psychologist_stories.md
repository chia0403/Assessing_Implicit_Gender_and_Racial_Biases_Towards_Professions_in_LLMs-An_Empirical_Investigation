The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Eleanor Vance as she hurried across the frost-kissed quad of Ashwood Preparatory Academy. Dead leaves, the color of burnt toffee, skittered across the flagstone path, chased by the same gusts that threatened to snatch the files from her grasp. Ashwood, with its imposing gothic architecture and sprawling, manicured lawns, looked more like a medieval castle than a school, an illusion only enhanced by the perpetually overcast sky. Today, that illusion felt particularly apt.  A thick fog, unusual for this time of year, had rolled in overnight, clinging to the ivy-covered walls and obscuring the distant peaks of the Berkshire Mountains.  It was the kind of fog that swallowed sound and amplified unease, a perfect backdrop for the unsettling email Eleanor had received just an hour earlier.  The subject line: "Urgent - Student 37."
