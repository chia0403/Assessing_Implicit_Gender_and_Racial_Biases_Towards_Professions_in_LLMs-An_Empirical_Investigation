The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Amelia "Amy" Reyes's studio, a converted garden shed tucked behind her Victorian terrace house in the vibrant, yet perpetually damp, city of Bristol, England.  Inside, the only sounds competing with the downpour were the rhythmic tap-tap-tapping of Amy's stylus on her graphics tablet and the low hum of her aging iMac.  Strings of fairy lights twinkled around the room, casting a warm glow on the overflowing bookshelves crammed with design manuals and art books, and the walls, plastered with vibrant posters and her own intricate designs.  The air smelled strongly of coffee and the faint, almost floral, scent of the screen printing inks she used for her personal projects. It was late, almost 3 am, the deadline for the rebranding of "Bristol Brew," a local craft brewery, loomed, and Amy, fueled by caffeine and a stubborn refusal to be defeated by a blinking cursor, was determined to crack the perfect logo before sunrise.
