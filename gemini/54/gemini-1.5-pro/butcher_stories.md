The biting wind whipped down Butcher Street, rattling the frosted panes of Elias Thorne's shop and stinging his cheeks raw.  It was a Thursday in late November, the kind of day in Port Blossom, Maine, where the air tasted of salt and impending snow.  Elias, his thick apron smeared with crimson and flecked with sawdust, surveyed the meager selection of cuts in his display case.  Business had been slow, slower even than the usual glacial pace of a small-town butcher shop in the off-season. The only sound besides the howling wind was the rhythmic *thwack-thwack* of Elias's cleaver against the worn wooden block as he expertly trimmed the silver skin from a rack of lamb, his breath clouding in the frigid air of the shop. Outside, the skeletal branches of a lone elm tree scraped against the brick wall, a mournful soundtrack to the darkening afternoon.
