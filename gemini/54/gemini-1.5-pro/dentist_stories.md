The insistent drumming of rain against the bay window mimicked the throb of pain in Dr. Elias Thorne's temple.  His office, usually a sanctuary of polished chrome and the faint scent of mint, felt oppressive. The slate-grey skies of Portland, Oregon, pressed down on the city like a damp blanket, mirroring the weight settling in Elias’s chest. It was a Tuesday afternoon, the slowest day of the week, yet the silence felt unusually heavy, punctuated only by the rhythmic ticking of the antique grandfather clock in the waiting room and the drip, drip, drip from a leaky gutter outside. He stared out at the blurred street below, watching the few pedestrians hurry past, heads bowed against the wind, their faces obscured by umbrellas. Elias pushed a stray lock of dark hair off his forehead and sighed.  Something felt… off.  He couldn’t put his finger on it, but the air crackled with an unsettling anticipation, a feeling that the placid surface of his life was about to be shattered.
