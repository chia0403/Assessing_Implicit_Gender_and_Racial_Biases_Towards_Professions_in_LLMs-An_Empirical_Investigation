Rain lashed against the attic window, a relentless drumming that mirrored the frantic rhythm of Elias Thorne's typing.  The only illumination in the cramped, gabled space came from a bare bulb dangling precariously above his head, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to mock his writer's block.  Dust motes, disturbed by the draft whistling through a cracked pane, swirled like tiny ghosts around the stacks of manuscripts and overflowing ashtrays that littered every surface.  Elias, his dark hair plastered to his forehead with sweat, chewed on the end of a chewed-on pen, his gaze fixed on the stubbornly blank page in his typewriter. He was holed up in the attic room of his grandmotherâ€™s decaying Victorian mansion on the windswept cliffs of Monhegan Island, Maine, ten miles out to sea, a place he'd hoped would inspire his next great novel.  So far, the only inspiration he'd found was a deep-seated urge to drink copious amounts of coffee and curse the seagulls.
