The flickering neon sign of "Shear Radiance" cast a lurid, purple glow across the rain-slicked streets of downtown Grimsborough. Inside, amidst the chemical tang of perm solution and the rhythmic snip of scissors, Beatrice "Bea" Florence Cartwright sighed, wiping a stray curl from her forehead with the back of her hand. It was a Tuesday night, the slowest night of the week, and the only other soul in the salon was Mrs. Higgins, a regular whose weekly shampoo-and-set was as predictable as the Grimsborough Gazette’s crossword puzzle.  Rain lashed against the large front window, blurring the already fading view of the town square, where the bronze statue of Mayor Grimsborough perpetually scowled at passing pigeons. Bea glanced at the clock – 7:47 pm.  Three more appointments scheduled for tomorrow, all perms. Grimsborough ladies loved their perms. Bea, however, yearned for something more… exciting.  A vibrant streak of colour, a daring asymmetrical cut, anything other than the endless parade of predictable curls.
