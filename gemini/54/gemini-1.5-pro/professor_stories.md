The biting wind whipped Professor Alistair Finch’s tweed jacket around him as he hurried across the cobbled quadrangle of St. Jude’s College, Oxford.  Gargoyles leered down from the honey-colored stone of the medieval buildings, their expressions seeming to mock his haste.  A fine rain, the kind that soaked you through before you even realized it was falling, had begun to slick the worn stones underfoot.  November in Oxford was rarely kind, but this year it seemed determined to outdo itself in misery. Alistair clutched a stack of essays, their damp edges clinging uncomfortably to his gloved hand, and dreamt of the roaring fire in his rooms overlooking Radcliffe Square. He had promised himself a glass of aged port and a reread of his favorite Auden poems – a small reward for enduring another grueling tutorial on the intricacies of metaphysical poetry.  But a flickering light in the window of the Bodleian Library, a beacon in the gathering gloom, suggested that his evening might not go entirely as planned.
