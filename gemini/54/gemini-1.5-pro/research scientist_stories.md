The biting Antarctic wind whipped at Dr. Evelyn Reedâ€™s parka, stinging any exposed skin despite the layers of thermal protection.  The sun, a weak, watery disc hanging low on the horizon, cast long, distorted shadows across the endless expanse of ice and snow.  Evelyn, her breath clouding the frigid air, adjusted the bulky goggles perched on her nose and squinted at the readout on her handheld spectrometer.  She stood precariously balanced on a creaking aluminum ladder, its feet sunk deep into the drifts, facing the sheer ice wall that marked the entrance to the newly discovered cave system.  Designated X-49B by the McMurdo research team, the cave was more than just a geological anomaly; the subtle energy readings emanating from its depths hinted at something far more extraordinary.  Something that Evelyn, a geophysicist with a penchant for the unexplained, had dedicated the last three years of her life to finding.
