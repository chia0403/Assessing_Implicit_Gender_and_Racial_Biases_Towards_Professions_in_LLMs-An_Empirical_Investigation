Rain lashed against the arched windows of Genevieve "Gigi" Beaumont's atelier, blurring the already fading light of a November afternoon in Paris.  Gigi, perched precariously on a gilded ladder, adjusted a swag of emerald velvet that framed a newly restored 18th-century tapestry depicting a rather bucolic, and ironically sunny, vineyard scene. Her studio, tucked away on a cobbled side street in the Marais, was a chaotic symphony of textures and colours. Rolls of silk wallpaper leaned against antique armoires, paint swatches spilled across a marble-topped table like fallen autumn leaves, and a half-finished mood board featuring a riot of jewel tones and Art Deco motifs lay pinned to a corkboard. The air hummed with the scent of beeswax polish, old books, and the faintest hint of Gigi's signature perfume â€“ a bespoke blend of sandalwood and orange blossom.  This wasn't just a workspace; it was a sanctuary, a reflection of her eclectic soul, and the birthplace of her meticulously curated designs. But on this particular evening, a sense of unease settled over Gigi, a premonition that the storm brewing outside was more than just meteorological.
