Inside, amidst a kaleidoscope of silks, satins, and velvets, Elsie herself, full name Elsie Aurelia Hopkinson, hunched over her workbench.  Her nimble fingers, calloused yet graceful, coaxed a rebellious length of emerald green taffeta into the shape of a dramatic peplum. Elsie's shop, "Hopkinson's Haberdashery and Haute Couture," was nestled between a dusty antique store and a perpetually bustling fishmonger's in the heart of the quaint, seaside town of Port Blossom, Maine.  The air inside, thick with the scent of lavender sachets and freshly pressed linen, offered a welcome refuge from the blustery coastal weather.  The year was 1928, and flapper dresses were all the rage, but Elsie had a knack for crafting timeless pieces, gowns that whispered elegance and sophistication rather than shouting the latest trends. Today, however, a different kind of challenge awaited her, one far more complex than a difficult hemline or a fussy client.  A telegram had arrived earlier that morning, bearing news that would change the course of Elsie's quiet, predictable life forever.
