The biting November wind whipped at Amelia “Mia” Rodriguez’s cheeks, turning them the same shade as the crimson maple leaves she was raking into a neat pile.  Frost crunched satisfyingly beneath her work boots as she surveyed Mrs. Henderson's sprawling backyard.  Towering oaks, their branches skeletal against the steel-grey sky, dominated the property, casting long, dramatic shadows across the meticulously manicured lawn.  Nestled in the heart of Connecticut’s Litchfield County, the Henderson estate was a testament to old money and even older trees, a place where manicured hedges whispered secrets and stone fountains sang softly of bygone eras. Mia, however, was more concerned with the encroaching winter and the task at hand: preparing this slice of autumnal perfection for its long, cold sleep.  A thin layer of ice had already begun to form on the surface of the koi pond, a delicate skin mirroring the brittle beauty of the season. This was her last big job before the ground froze solid, and Mia, despite the chill, felt a familiar sense of satisfaction settling in her bones.  She loved this work, the tangible reward of transforming a space, of coaxing beauty from the earth, even in its dormancy.
