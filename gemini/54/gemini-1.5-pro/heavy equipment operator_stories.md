The biting wind whipped across the desolate expanse of the Alaskan tundra, stinging Rosalind "Roz" Petrova's cheeks even through the layers of thermal fleece.  The sky, a bruised purple-grey, threatened snow.  Roz, perched high in the cab of her D11 dozer, surveyed the landscape. Before her stretched miles of frozen earth, scarred by the nascent pipeline trench that snaked its way towards the horizon. The rhythmic rumble of the massive machine vibrated through her bones, a familiar and comforting sensation.  North Slope Oil Field Seven was a lonely, unforgiving place, but it was Roz's domain, and the D11 her throne.  The sun, a pale ghost on the southern horizon, cast long, distorted shadows across the snow-dusted ground.  This far north, in late November, daylight was a precious commodity, and today, it was already fading fast. A radio crackled to life, breaking the monotonous drone of the engine.  "Roz, you read me?" a gruff voice inquired.  It was Lars, the foreman, his voice tight with a familiar edge of concern.  Something was wrong. Roz could feel it in the air, thicker than the impending snow.
