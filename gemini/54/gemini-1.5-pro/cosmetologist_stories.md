The biting November wind whipped around Genevieve "Gen" Dubois as she hurried down Bleecker Street, the scent of roasted chestnuts vying with the ever-present aroma of exhaust fumes.  Her breath puffed out in white clouds, momentarily obscuring the vibrant graffiti that adorned the brick walls of the West Village brownstones. Gen clutched her worn leather satchel tighter, its contents – her prized collection of makeup brushes and a dog-eared copy of Vogue – jostling against her side.  Tonight was the opening night of "Urban Canvas," a gritty, avant-garde theatre production showcasing the talents of up-and-coming designers, and Gen, the production's lead cosmetologist, was already running late.  The flickering neon sign of "The Electric Playhouse," a converted warehouse theatre tucked between a vintage bookstore and a falafel joint, pulsed with an erratic energy that mirrored the fluttering in Gen's stomach. This was her biggest break yet, and the pressure to deliver breathtaking, transformative looks was immense.  Inside, the air crackled with a chaotic symphony of last-minute preparations: the murmur of hushed conversations, the rustle of fabric, and the rhythmic thump of electronic music bleeding through the thick velvet curtains.  Gen pushed open the heavy stage door, stepping into a whirlwind of controlled chaos.
