The biting November wind whipped off Lake Erie, stinging Amelia Hayes’ exposed cheeks as she hurried across the slushy parking lot of St. Jude's Community Clinic.  Flu season had arrived with a vengeance, transforming the normally quiet clinic into a buzzing hive of coughing, sniffling, and general misery.

The brick facade of the clinic, normally a warm, inviting red, looked grim under the steel-grey sky. Inside, the fluorescent lights hummed a counterpoint to the cacophony of illness, a soundtrack Amelia had come to associate with the onset of winter in Buffalo, New York.  She pushed open the heavy glass doors, the blast of warm, antiseptic-scented air a small comfort against the bitter cold.  It was going to be a long day.
