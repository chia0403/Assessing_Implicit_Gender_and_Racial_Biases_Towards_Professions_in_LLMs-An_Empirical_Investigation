The biting wind, sharp as a freshly honed axe, whipped through the towering pines of the Bitterroot Mountains, carrying the scent of sap and sawdust.  A plume of white smoke rose lazily from the squat chimney of a cabin nestled at the edge of a clearing, dwarfed by the ancient giants surrounding it. Inside, Jedediah "Jed" Blackwood, his face etched with the lines of hard work and the wisdom of the woods, stoked the iron stove, chasing away the lingering chill of a Montana November morning.  The first rays of dawn, filtered through the frosted pane, glinted off the calloused ridges of his hands as he poured himself a mug of steaming coffee, the metallic tang mixing with the aroma of pine needles burning in the hearth.  Outside, the rhythmic thrum of the sawmill, momentarily silenced, promised another day of wrestling nature's bounty into submission. This was Jed's life, a solitary existence intertwined with the fate of these woods, a life he wouldn't trade for any riches the city could offer.  But the quiet solitude he cherished was about to be shattered.
