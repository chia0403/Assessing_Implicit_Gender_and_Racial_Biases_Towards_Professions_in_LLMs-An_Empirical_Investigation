The bell above the door of "Petal & Plume" tinkled a melancholic two-note tune as the November wind whipped in, carrying the scent of woodsmoke and damp leaves.  Rain lashed against the large front window, blurring the view of the cobbled street of Port Blossom, Oregon.  Inside, Eloise Clementine Hawthorne, her hands stained a gentle green from conditioning stems, surveyed her shop with a sigh.  Garlands of dried hydrangeas and eucalyptus draped from the exposed beams, casting long, dancing shadows in the flickering light of the wrought-iron chandelier.  The air, usually thick with the perfume of lilies and roses, held a chill that no amount of floral fragrance could quite dispel.  This was typically the slow season, but this year, the quiet felt different, heavier, like a prelude to something more.
