The biting wind whipped off the Puget Sound, tugging at the edges of Elias Thorne's charcoal grey scarf.  He stood on the windswept bluff overlooking the construction site, a precarious perch that offered a breathtaking, if chilling, view of the skeletal frame of the Olympic Sculpture Park Pavilion.  Seattle, a tapestry of steel and glass stitched onto the undulating hills, sprawled before him, the Space Needle a distant, silver exclamation point against the bruised twilight sky.  Elias, his breath clouding the frigid air, adjusted the hard hat perched atop his unruly brown hair and frowned.  The pavilion, his most ambitious project to date, was beautiful, yes, a symphony of glass and weathering steel designed to embrace the elements.  But tonight, under the oppressive grey sky, it lookedâ€¦vulnerable.  Almost as if the wind, whispering secrets through the skeletal frame, was threatening to tear it apart.
