The biting wind whipped at Elias Thorne's thick wool cloak, the icy tendrils snaking past the high collar and stinging his cheeks.  Flakes of snow, large and lazy, danced in the swirling gusts, obscuring the already limited visibility across the vast, frozen expanse of the Obsidian Plateau.  Elias stamped his feet, the heavy clang of his steel-shod boots echoing faintly against the sheer, black cliffs that ringed the plateau.  He was stationed at the Raven's Gate, the sole entrance to the secluded monastery of Whisperwind, carved directly into the cliff face five hundred feet above. The gate itself was a wrought iron monstrosity, its bars twisted into the shape of grasping ravens, their beaks pointed menacingly outward.  For generations, the monks within had dedicated themselves to silent contemplation and the study of ancient prophecies, and it was Elias's duty, along with a handful of other guards who rotated shifts, to ensure their solitude remained unbroken. Tonight, however, the solitude felt less like peace and more like a prelude to something ominous.
