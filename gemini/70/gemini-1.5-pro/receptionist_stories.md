The insistent whir of the faulty air conditioning unit in the lobby of the Grand Magnolia Hotel was the soundtrack to Amelia Grace Holloway's life.  It pulsed, a mechanical heartbeat against the faded grandeur of the once-opulent establishment.  Dust motes danced in the streams of afternoon sunlight slanting through the tall arched windows, illuminating frayed patches on the Persian rug and the chipped gilt on the enormous, empty birdcage that served as a rather melancholy centrepiece.  Built in 1888, the Grand Magnolia had seen better days, but Amelia, perched behind the hulking mahogany reception desk, was stubbornly determined to see the charm beneath the decay.  Charleston, South Carolina, hung heavy with the humid heat of a July afternoon, and the air, even inside, smelled of sweet tea and impending thunderstorms.  The lobby was deserted, save for Amelia and the persistent hum of the air conditioner, a silence broken only by the occasional creak of the ancient elevator and the rhythmic tap-tap-tapping of Ameliaâ€™s perfectly manicured nails against the worn desktop as she waited for the phone to ring.
