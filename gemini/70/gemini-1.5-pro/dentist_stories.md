The crisp October air, scented with woodsmoke and decaying leaves, whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne as he locked up his practice, Thorne Family Dentistry.  Nestled between a bustling bakery and a perpetually empty storefront in the small town of Oakhaven, Vermont, the building itself was a charming Victorian, all gingerbread trim and stained glass windows. Inside, the modern equipment hummed faintly, even in sleep mode, a stark contrast to the antique grandfather clock ticking solemnly in the waiting room. Elias adjusted his scarf, the wool scratching against his neatly trimmed beard, and turned towards home, the crunch of frost-covered leaves beneath his boots the only sound accompanying his thoughts. This was usually a peaceful time of day, the transition between the controlled chaos of his workday and the quiet comfort of his evening. But tonight, a disquiet hung in the air, a premonition that the usual tranquility of Oakhaven was about to be shattered.
