The fluorescent lights of the St. Jude's Memorial Hospital phlebotomy lab hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Reyes's Tuesday morning.  Rain lashed against the single, grimy window, blurring the already dreary view of the hospital parking lot.  Amelia, her name tag pinned neatly to her crisp white coat, adjusted her purple nitrile gloves.  The air smelled faintly of antiseptic and the metallic tang of blood, a scent she'd long since become accustomed to.  At 7:03 am, the lab was eerily quiet, the usual pre-dawn rush of emergency room draws having subsided. Only the rhythmic beep of a nearby IV pump and the gentle whir of a centrifuge broke the silence.  Amelia tapped a pen against her clipboard, a nervous habit sheâ€™d picked up during phlebotomy school, anticipating the arrival of her first patient of the day.  A gurney rattled in the hallway outside, its squeaky wheels heralding the beginning of another busy shift.
