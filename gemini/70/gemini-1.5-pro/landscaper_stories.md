The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorne, tugging at the brim of his worn canvas hat and rustling the dried leaves clinging precariously to the oak branches overhead.  Frost crunched under his heavy work boots as he surveyed the sprawling grounds of Eventide Manor.  A grey stone behemoth perched atop a windswept hill overlooking the churning Atlantic, the manor seemed to exhale the chill of the coming winter.  Elias pulled his thick wool scarf higher, the salt spray from the ocean dampening his already chapped cheeks. He had been hired to revitalize the neglected gardens of Eventide, a task that seemed as daunting as the manor itself. Decades of neglect had transformed what were once meticulously manicured lawns and vibrant flowerbeds into a tangle of weeds and overgrown shrubs.  But Elias, with his calloused hands and unwavering dedication to the green world, was determined to breathe life back into this forgotten landscape, even as winter tightened its icy grip on the Maine coast.
