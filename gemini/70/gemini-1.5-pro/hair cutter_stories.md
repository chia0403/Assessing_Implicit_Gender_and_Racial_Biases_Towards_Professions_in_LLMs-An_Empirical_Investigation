The flickering neon sign of "Shear Delights" cast a lurid, purple glow across the rain-slicked asphalt of Sycamore Street. Inside, amidst the swirling scent of hairspray and the rhythmic snip of scissors, Beatrice "Bea" Aurelia Dubois surveyed her domain.  It was a Tuesday night in October, the kind that clung to the edge of summer with a damp, reluctant grip, in the perpetually overcast town of Port Blossom, Oregon. Bea, with her close-cropped silver hair and a mischievous glint in her emerald green eyes, leaned against the worn, leather barber chair, watching the streetlights reflect in the puddles outside.  Business was slow, the only sound the hum of the dusty ceiling fan and the gentle patter of rain against the large front window.  Bea wouldn't have had it any other way. Slow nights meant time to think, to sharpen her shears, and to contemplate the tangled secrets held within the hearts of her clients â€“ secrets she often gleaned with every snip and curl.  Tonight, however, a different kind of secret was brewing, one that had nothing to do with split ends or bad dye jobs.  A black car, sleek and silent as a panther, pulled up across the street, its headlights momentarily blinding Bea before cutting through the gloom.  Someone stepped out, a figure shrouded in shadow, and Bea's grip on her shears tightened.
