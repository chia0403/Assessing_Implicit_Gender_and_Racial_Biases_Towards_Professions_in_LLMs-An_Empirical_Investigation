The biting November wind whipped at Amelia "Mia" Rodriguez's turnout coat as she stood on the precipice of Widow's Peak, the highest point in Blackwood County.  Below, the valley stretched out like a rumpled, browning carpet, dotted with the flickering lights of the small town of Havenwood.  Pine trees clawed at the rocky slopes, their branches heavy with a fresh dusting of snow, and the air, thin and crisp, carried the scent of woodsmoke and impending winter. Mia, her helmet tucked under one arm, leaned against the rusted guardrail, the metal cold against her gloved hand.  The radio clipped to her belt crackled with static, the only sound other than the mournful sigh of the wind.  It was supposed to be a quiet night, just another routine patrol for wildfire risks during the dry season.  But the unease that had settled in Miaâ€™s stomach since sunset told her this night would be anything but.
