The biting November wind whipped off Lake Michigan, sending icy tendrils down Detective Isabella “Izzy” Diaz’s collar.  She pulled her scarf tighter, the rough wool scratching against her cheek.  The blinking red and blue lights of her squad car reflected off the grimy brick walls of the abandoned warehouse on West Pershing Road, casting eerie shadows that danced in the swirling snow flurries.  The call had come in just before 3 a.m.: a possible break-in.  Dispatch had mentioned hearing a woman scream over the open line before it went dead.  Now, the only sound was the low hum of the wind and the distant drone of city traffic, a stark contrast to the frantic urgency that had sent Izzy racing across Chicago’s near South Side.  Gun drawn, she cautiously approached the warehouse’s steel door, the rusted metal groaning like a dying beast as she pushed it open a crack.
