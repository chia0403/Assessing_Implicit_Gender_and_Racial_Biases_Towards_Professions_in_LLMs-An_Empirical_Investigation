The sky, a vast, bruised purple, threatened snow, though the sun, a pale, watery eye, still clung to the horizon. Zeke, his weathered face etched with the lines of a life spent battling the elements and the capricious whims of cattle, surveyed his land. The Blackwood Ranch, nestled in the heart of the Montana badlands, stretched out before him like a rumpled brown blanket, hemmed in by jagged buttes and the ribbon of the Milk River snaking its way through the valley below.  A thousand acres of hard-won prosperity, bought and paid for with sweat, grit, and the occasional broken bone.  But today, a different kind of unease gnawed at Zeke, a premonition as cold and sharp as the approaching winter.  Something wasn't right.  The usual symphony of lowing cattle was muted, replaced by an unsettling silence.
