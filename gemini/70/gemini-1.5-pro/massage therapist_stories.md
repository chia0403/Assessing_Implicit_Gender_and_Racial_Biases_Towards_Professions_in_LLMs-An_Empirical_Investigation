The insistent Florida sun beat down on the turquoise awning of "Kneadful Things," baking the faux-wood planks beneath Amelia Grace Holloway's bare feet.  The air, thick and heavy with the scent of jasmine and impending rain, hung motionless around her as she meticulously swept fallen blossoms from the porch.  Amelia, her auburn braid draped over one shoulder, paused to admire the new wind chimes tinkling gently in the breeze â€“ a recent addition meant to further cultivate the sense of tranquility she strived for in her small, beachside massage therapy practice.  Located just a block from the sugar-white sands of Clearwater Beach, the converted bungalow was her sanctuary, a place where knotted muscles and weary souls could find respite. Inside, the soft glow of Himalayan salt lamps cast a warm, inviting light, hinting at the calm within, a stark contrast to the brewing storm gathering on the horizon.
