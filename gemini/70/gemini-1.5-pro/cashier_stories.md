The flickering fluorescent lights of the Quick Stop buzzed a monotonous B flat, a soundtrack to Amelia Reyes's Tuesday afternoon.  Rain lashed against the single pane window, blurring the neon glow of the "We're Open 24/7" sign and obscuring the rundown strip mall parking lot beyond. Inside, the air hung thick with the cloying sweetness of stale coffee and the faint tang of desperation emanating from the day-old hot dogs rotating slowly on the greasy metal rollers. Amelia, her name tag pinned slightly askew on her faded blue uniform shirt, chewed absently on the end of a ballpoint pen, her gaze fixed on the digital clock above the lottery tickets.  5:47 pm.  Seventeen more minutes before her shift ended and she could escape the fluorescent purgatory and the predictable parade of personalities that defined her working life in the desolate corner of suburban New Jersey.
