The crisp October air, scented with woodsmoke and decaying leaves, whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne as he hurried across the cobblestone courtyard of Burnham Manor.  Built in the late 1700s, the sprawling manor house, now a rehabilitation center, cast long shadows in the afternoon sun.  Ivy, the color of rust and dried blood, clung to the weathered stone walls, its tendrils reaching towards the leaded glass windows like skeletal fingers.  Elias tugged his tweed jacket tighter, a shiver not entirely from the cold running down his spine.  Heâ€™d been at Burnham Manor for only three weeks, but the place already had a way of getting under his skin, a sense of unease that lingered like the phantom pains of his patients. He was here to rebuild lives, to restore function, but he couldn't shake the feeling something else needed restoring within those aged walls. Something far older, and far less tangible, than a broken bone.
