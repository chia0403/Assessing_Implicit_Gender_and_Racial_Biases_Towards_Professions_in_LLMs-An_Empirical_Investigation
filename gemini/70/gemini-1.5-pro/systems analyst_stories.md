Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of the Kestrel Corporation building, blurring the already fading twilight of Seattle into a smeary grey.  Inside, the air hummed with the low thrum of servers and the frantic click-clack of keyboards.  Eleanor Vance, a systems analyst with a penchant for oversized cardigans and an even greater one for solving complex technical puzzles, stared intently at her monitor. Lines of code scrolled past, cryptic symbols dancing across the screen like an indecipherable language.  Tonight, however, Eleanor wasn’t deciphering code – she was searching for something that shouldn’t exist. A ghost in the machine.  For the past three nights, a series of unexplained micro-outages had plagued Kestrel’s internal network, vanishing as quickly as they appeared, leaving no trace but a growing sense of unease.  Eleanor, the only one who’d noticed the pattern, had volunteered to stay late, determined to hunt down the source of the phantom glitches before they escalated into something far more serious. The aroma of stale coffee hung heavy in the air, a testament to the many hours she’d already spent chasing digital shadows.  Outside, the rain continued its relentless assault, mirroring the storm brewing inside Eleanor’s mind.
