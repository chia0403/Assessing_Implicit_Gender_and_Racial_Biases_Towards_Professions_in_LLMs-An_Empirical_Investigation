The relentless Nevada sun beat down on the dusty asphalt of Harmony Springs, a town so small it boasted only a single flashing yellow light. Inside Harmony Springs Pharmacy, the air conditioning whirred a valiant, if somewhat losing, battle against the oppressive heat. Eleanor Vance Holloway, Pharm.D., meticulously counted out metformin tablets, the clinking sound a rhythmic counterpoint to the desultory buzz of a lone housefly trapped against the windowpane. The pharmacy, with its worn linoleum floor and shelves crammed with everything from denture adhesive to locally-sourced honey, was her kingdom.  A faded poster of a majestic desert sunset, peeling at the corners, hung above the blood pressure machine â€“ a wistful reminder of a world beyond the dry, cracked landscape that stretched in every direction. Eleanor, with her crisp white coat and a perpetually concerned furrow in her brow, was as much a fixture of Harmony Springs as the rusted-out pickup truck permanently parked outside the abandoned gas station across the street. This Tuesday, however, was about to become anything but ordinary.
