The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of The Rusty Spatula, a greasy spoon diner clinging to the edge of Highway 17 like a limpet on a rusty hull. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of frying onions, stale coffee, and desperation.  Neon signs flickered erratically, casting a sickly yellow glow over the worn vinyl booths and chipped Formica counter. Eleanor Grace Holloway, her name tag slightly askew on her faded blue uniform, wiped down the sticky surface for the tenth time that hour, her gaze fixed on the empty highway stretching into the storm-lashed darkness.  It was a Tuesday night in October, the kind of night that swallowed even the bravest souls whole, leaving only the dregs to cling to the flickering warmth of places like The Rusty Spatula.  Eleanor knew them all: the truckers with their tales of the open road, the lonely locals nursing their beers and regrets, and the occasional lost tourist, blinking in the harsh light like a bewildered moth. Tonight, however, the only company she had was the relentless drumming of the rain and the gnawing feeling that something was about to change.
