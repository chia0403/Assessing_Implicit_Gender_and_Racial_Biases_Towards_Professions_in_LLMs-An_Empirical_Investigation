The flickering neon sign of the "Last Chance Diner" cast an oily, electric-blue sheen across the rain-slicked asphalt of Highway 17. Inside, Beatrice "Bea" Aurelia Cartwright squinted at the spaghetti of wires spilling from the gutted chassis of a Zenith Trans-Oceanic radio.  The diner, a lonely outpost on the edge of the Mojave Desert, just a few miles shy of the Nevada state line, was her workshop tonight. Bea, her greasy overalls a stark contrast to her delicate, silver-rimmed spectacles, hummed a mournful tune along with the static crackling from the speaker, a sound far removed from the rhythmic big-band broadcasts the radio was designed for. The desert wind howled outside, rattling the dusty windows, a symphony accompanying the intermittent buzz of the faulty vacuum tube she held between her thumb and forefinger. It was 1957, and the air crackled with more than just static.  Something else was out there, something Bea could almost hear whispering beneath the usual desert silence, and she suspected this old radio held the key.
