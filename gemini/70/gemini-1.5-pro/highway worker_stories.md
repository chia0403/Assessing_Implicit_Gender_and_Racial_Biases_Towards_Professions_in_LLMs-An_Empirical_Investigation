The sun, a malevolent orange eye low on the horizon, baked the Arizona asphalt until it shimmered like water. Heat waves danced above the cracked surface of Route 66, distorting the view of the distant mesas. Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of reddish-brown dirt, whirled across the empty landscape, occasionally whipping at the bright orange cones that marked off the closed lane.  Darrell “Dusty” McMillan, sweat plastering his salt-and-pepper hair to his forehead, leaned against the battered door of his Ford F-250 work truck, the rumble of its idling engine a low counterpoint to the chirping of cicadas.  He squinted at the seemingly endless stretch of road ahead, a ribbon of black unwinding towards the fiery sunset.  This was his domain, his kingdom of cracked asphalt and faded lane markers, and today, it was his personal oven.  A sign flashed ahead, warning of roadwork for the next ten miles.  Ten miles of patching potholes under this brutal sun.  Dusty sighed, grabbed his hard hat from the dashboard, and pushed open the truck door.  Another day, another mile.
