The mahogany clock in Judge Elias Thorne's chambers chimed four times, a mournful clang in the otherwise silent room. Rain lashed against the tall, arched windows, mirroring the storm brewing inside Elias himself. Grey light, filtered through the downpour, barely illuminated the stacks of legal documents piled haphazardly on his desk.  His office, usually a sanctuary of order and calm within the bustling confines of the Los Angeles County Superior Court, felt oppressive tonight. The scent of old leather and stale coffee hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the petrichor carried in on the wind from the storm raging outside. This was his last night in this room, in this city.  Tomorrow, Elias was leaving Los Angeles, and the legal profession, behind.
