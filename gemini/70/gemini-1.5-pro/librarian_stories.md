The scent of aging paper and lemon polish hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma to Elias Thorne.  He stood at the grand oak circulation desk of the Whispering Pines Public Library, its polished surface reflecting the soft glow of the Tiffany-style lamps that dotted the reading room.  Outside, a late October wind howled through the pines that gave the town, and the library, its name. Whispering Pines, nestled deep in the Adirondack Mountains of upstate New York, was a town built on stories â€“ both the ones told around crackling fireplaces and the ones carefully preserved within the very walls of the library Elias called his second home.  This Tuesday evening, however, the usual hushed tranquility was shattered by a frantic rapping at the front door, a persistent rhythm against the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner.  The library was officially closed, and Elias was already ten minutes past his usual departure time. He sighed, pushing his wire-rimmed glasses further up his nose, and headed towards the insistent knocking, a sense of foreboding settling in his stomach.
