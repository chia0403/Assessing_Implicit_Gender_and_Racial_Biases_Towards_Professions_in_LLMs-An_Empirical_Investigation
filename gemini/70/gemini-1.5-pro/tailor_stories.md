The year is 1888. A chill wind, carrying the scent of coal smoke and damp wool, whipped through the cobbled alleyways of Whitechapel, London.  Gas lamps flickered feebly, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to writhe with a life of their own. In a small, cluttered shop tucked between a butcher and a public house, Elias Finch, a tailor of renowned skill but modest means, hunched over his workbench.  The single lamp above illuminated the rich textures of the fabrics spread before him:  emerald green velvet, sapphire blue silk, and a length of crimson brocade that shimmered like captured firelight.  Elias, his spectacles perched precariously on his nose, meticulously pinned a pattern onto the velvet, his brow furrowed in concentration.  The rhythmic snip-snip of his shears was the only sound in the otherwise silent shop, save for the occasional distant clatter of a passing hansom cab.  Tonight, however, the quiet held a particular edge, a tense anticipation that seemed to cling to the very air.
