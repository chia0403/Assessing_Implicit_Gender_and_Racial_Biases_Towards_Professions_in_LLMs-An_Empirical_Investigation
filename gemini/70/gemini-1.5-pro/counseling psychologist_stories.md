Rain lashed against the arched windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's office, mimicking the tempest brewing inside his newest patient.  The room, nestled in a converted Victorian house on a quiet, tree-lined street in Ashworth, Massachusetts, usually exuded a calming atmosphere.  Warm, ochre walls were adorned with framed botanical prints, a plush, emerald green sofa sat opposite two worn leather armchairs, and a low table held a collection of smooth, worry stones.  But tonight, even the flickering light of the salt lamp in the corner couldnâ€™t dispel the tension that crackled in the air.  A young woman with eyes the color of storm clouds sat rigidly on the edge of the sofa, her hands clenched in her lap.  Elias, steepling his fingers thoughtfully, waited patiently for her to speak, the only sound the rhythmic drumming of the rain and the ticking of the antique grandfather clock in the hall.
