The insistent California sun, already high and hot even at 8:00 am, beat down on the asphalt of the McKinley Elementary School parking lot.  Amelia Rose Hawthorne squinted, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair out of her eyes as she wrestled a particularly stubborn box of construction paper out of the trunk of her aging Prius. Palm trees swayed lazily in the light breeze that offered little reprieve from the heat, and the faint scent of chlorine from the nearby public pool drifted on the air.  Amelia, dressed in a floral sundress and sensible sandals, sighed.  Third grade was notoriously enthusiastic about arts and crafts, which meant her summer had been spent scouring clearance aisles for discounted glitter, glue, and enough pipe cleaners to reach the moon and back.  This year's theme was “Under the Sea,” and Amelia was determined to transform her classroom into a vibrant, coral-reef-inspired paradise, even if it meant sacrificing a few more weekends of beach trips.  This, she reminded herself as she lugged the box towards the cheerfully painted double doors, was why she became a teacher.  To inspire. To nurture. To create a world of wonder for the bright, curious minds that would soon fill these halls.
