Rain lashed against the grimy windows of The Daily Clarion, blurring the neon glow of "Joe's Eats" across the street into a hazy smear of red and yellow.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and impending deadlines.  Eleanor Vance, her dark hair pulled back in a messy bun, tapped a chipped mug against her teeth, the rhythmic clinking a counterpoint to the staccato drumming of rain.

A city more rust than steel these days, Zenith had seen better times, and so had The Clarion.  But Eleanor, ever the optimist (or perhaps just stubbornly persistent), still clung to the hope of uncovering a story that would shake the city, and maybe, just maybe, the world.
