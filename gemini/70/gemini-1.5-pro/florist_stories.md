The bell above the door of "Petal & Stem" jingled merrily, a counterpoint to the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of Eliza Jane Worthington’s shears.  Outside, the Charleston, South Carolina, air hung thick and humid, a shimmering veil over the cobblestone streets.  Inside, the small shop was a cool oasis bursting with color and fragrance.  Sunbeams, fractured by the prism hanging in the window, danced across buckets overflowing with hydrangeas the color of a summer sky, roses in shades from blush pink to deepest crimson, and fragrant lilies that perfumed the air with their heady scent.  Eliza, her auburn hair pulled back in a loose braid, was engrossed in arranging a cascading bouquet of white orchids, her brow furrowed in concentration as she considered the placement of each delicate bloom.  Today was particularly important: Mrs. Vandergelt, Charleston society's reigning queen, was hosting her annual garden party, and Eliza had been tasked with creating the floral arrangements – a make-or-break moment for her fledgling business.
