The biting wind whipped across the desolate expanse of the Black Mesa Quarry, carrying with it the fine, gritty dust that clung to everything and everyone.  Sunrise painted the eastern sky in shades of bruised purple and sickly yellow, a palette that reflected the general mood of the place.  Even the massive, rust-streaked excavators and dump trucks seemed to hunch against the chill.  Inside the heated cab of a Caterpillar 797F, Rosalind "Rosie" Marchant squinted at the pre-dawn gloom, her breath fogging the window.  The digital display on the dash blinked to life, illuminating her weathered face.  Another day, another mountain to move.  Today's target: Section 4, a particularly stubborn vein of iron ore that had been giving the blasting crews hell for the past week.  Rosie took a long pull from her thermos of lukewarm coffee, the bitter taste a familiar comfort.  She gripped the controls, the thick hydraulics groaning in protest as the behemoth machine rumbled to life. The quarry lights, strung across the jagged cliffs like a macabre Christmas display, flickered on, casting long, skeletal shadows that danced across the scarred landscape.  It was going to be a long one.
