The biting wind whipped at Amelia "Ace" Reyes's flight suit as she stood on the precipice of the world.  Or at least, it felt like it. The helipad jutted out from the monolithic Zenith Tower, the highest human-made structure on the terraformed Mars colony of New Olympus.  Five thousand meters below, the rust-colored dust swirled in intricate patterns, occasionally revealing glimpses of the pressurized domes that housed the majority of the colony’s population. The twin suns of Mars, faint and watery in the thin atmosphere, cast long, eerie shadows across the Tharsis plateau, a landscape of canyons and volcanoes that dwarfed even Earth’s Grand Canyon.  Ace adjusted her goggles, the crimson glare reflecting in their lenses, and prepped her customized Sikorsky X-97 SkyCrane for takeoff.  This wasn't a sightseeing tour.  This was a rescue mission, and every second counted.
