The wind, a biting, granite-edged thing, whipped across the slopes of Mount Cinder, tugging at Elias Thorne’s thick woolen cloak. Below him, the valley town of Quarrybrook huddled amongst the foothills, its slate roofs shimmering like scattered fish scales under the bruised twilight sky.  Smoke, the scent of woodsmoke and roasted barley, curled invitingly from chimneys, a stark contrast to the raw, mineral tang that clung to Elias’s clothes and permeated his calloused hands.  He knelt beside a half-finished statue, a noble griffon emerging from a block of obsidian, its wing still trapped within the stone. Elias’s chisel, worn smooth from years of patient work, lay forgotten beside him as he gazed out across the bleak, breathtaking landscape.  Winter was coming to Quarrybrook, and with it, a silence deeper than the mountain’s heart.
