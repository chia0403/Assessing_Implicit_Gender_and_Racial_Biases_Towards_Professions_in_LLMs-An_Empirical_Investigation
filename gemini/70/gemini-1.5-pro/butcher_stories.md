The biting wind, scented with woodsmoke and the faint metallic tang of the abattoir, whipped down High Street, tugging at the edges of Elias Thorne's thick apron. Flakes of snow, fat and lazy, began to settle on the cobblestones of Oakhaven, a small, isolated town nestled deep within the Derbyshire Peak District.  Elias, his breath clouding the frosty air, surveyed his shop, "Thorne's Fine Meats," with a practiced eye.  The gas lamps within cast a warm, inviting glow onto the rows of hanging sausages, the plump game birds, and the crimson slabs of beef and pork displayed artfully in the window.  It was Christmas Eve, 1888, and despite the encroaching darkness and the gathering storm, a festive energy thrummed beneath the surface of the usually quiet town. But Elias felt a chill deeper than the winter's bite, a premonition of something unsettling lurking beneath the veneer of holiday cheer.
