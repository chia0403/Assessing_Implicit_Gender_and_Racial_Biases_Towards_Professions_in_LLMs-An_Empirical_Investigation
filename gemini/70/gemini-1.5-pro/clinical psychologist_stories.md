Rain lashed against the mullioned windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, mimicking the relentless drumming of a headache she couldn't quite shake.  The antique clock on her mahogany desk ticked with measured precision, each second a tiny hammer blow against the fragile quiet of the room.  Her office, nestled on the second floor of a converted brownstone in Boston's historic Back Bay, usually offered a comforting sanctuary of leather-bound books and the faint aroma of vanilla from the diffuser she kept on a side table.  Tonight, however, the familiar space felt oppressive, the shadows thrown by the flickering gaslight in the street below painting grotesque shapes on the walls.  Eleanor, normally composed and meticulous, found herself fidgeting with the silver Celtic knot pendant she always wore, its coolness a small anchor in the rising tide of unease.  She glanced at the closed door, a shiver tracing its way down her spine. Her next patient was late, unusually so for the punctual Mr. Silas Blackwood, and Eleanor couldn't shake the feeling something was wrong.
