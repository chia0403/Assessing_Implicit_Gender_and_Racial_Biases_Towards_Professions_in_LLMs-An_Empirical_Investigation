The siren's wail sliced through the thick, humid air of a New Orleans summer night, a mournful counterpoint to the raucous jazz spilling from the open doorways of Frenchmen Street.  Rain, thick and warm as bathwater, plastered Amelia "Mia" Catherine Moreau's dark curls to her forehead as she clung to the handrail in the back of the speeding ambulance.  Neon signs blurred into streaks of lurid color, reflecting off the slick asphalt. Inside, the rhythmic beep of the heart monitor and the rasping breaths of their patient, a young man with a stab wound to the chest, created a grim soundtrack to their frantic race towards Charity Hospital. The air hung heavy with the coppery tang of blood and the antiseptic bite of disinfectant. Mia, her stomach churning with a mixture of adrenaline and nausea, adjusted the oxygen mask on the patient's face and silently prayed he'd make it the remaining six blocks.  The French Quarter, usually a vibrant tapestry of music, laughter, and the scent of beignets, felt tonight like a suffocating cage, closing in on its wounded.
