The biting November wind whipped off the Seine, rattling the dusty attic window of  Elodie Augustine Moreau's studio.  Paris, 1888.  A thin film of ice crinkled on the surface of the turpentine wash Elodie used to clean her brushes, and the single kerosene lamp cast long, wavering shadows across the canvas-strewn floor.  The room, nestled under the eaves of a crumbling building in Montmartre, was a chaotic symphony of color.  Half-finished portraits leaned against chipped easels, tubes of paint lay squeezed open like forgotten wounds, and the air hung thick with the scent of linseed oil and charcoal dust.  Elodie, bundled in a worn woolen shawl despite the stifling heat from the small iron stove, stood before her latest work, a portrait of a street urchin clutching a stolen baguette.  Her brow furrowed in concentration, a smudge of crimson paint staining her cheekbone like a rogue tear.  Outside, the gaslights flickered to life, painting the cobbled streets below in a hazy, romantic glow, a stark contrast to the raw, unflinching reality captured on Elodie's canvas.
