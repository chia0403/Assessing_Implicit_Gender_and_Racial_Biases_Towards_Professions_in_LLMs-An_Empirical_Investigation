The revolving door of the Grand Majestic Hotel sighed a gust of rain-scented air as Elias Finch, barely seventeen and drowning in a burgundy uniform two sizes too big, stepped back inside.  Crystal chandeliers dripped with light onto the plush carpet, reflecting in the polished marble floors. Outside, the Seattle sky wept a steady drizzle, blurring the neon glow of the Pike Place Market sign across the street.  The lobby buzzed with a low hum of conversation – a mix of weary travelers, chattering socialites, and the clinking of ice in crystal glasses from the Peacock Bar. Elias adjusted his cap, the gold braid itching against his forehead. This was his third week at the Majestic, and the grandeur of it all still hadn't quite worn off.  He was a small-town boy from Spokane, traded apple orchards for towering skyscrapers, and the quiet hum of crickets for the constant thrum of the city.  Tonight, however, a different kind of hum vibrated in the air – a tension Elias couldn't quite place, like the quiet before a summer storm.
