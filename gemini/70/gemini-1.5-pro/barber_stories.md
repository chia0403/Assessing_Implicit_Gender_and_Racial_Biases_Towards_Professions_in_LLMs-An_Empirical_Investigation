The rusty squeak of the barber chair was as familiar to Elias Thorne as his own heartbeat.  He’d heard it thousands of times – a rhythmic counterpoint to the snip-snip of his shears and the low hum of conversation that filled Thorne’s Tonsorial Parlour. The Parlour, nestled between Mrs. O’Malley’s perpetually fragrant bakery and Mr. Henderson’s dusty antique shop, was a small, comforting pocket of warmth and wood-panelled charm in the otherwise grey and blustery town of Port Blossom, Maine.  Salt air, whipped in from the restless Atlantic just a block away, perpetually clung to everything, coating the windows with a fine mist and lending the air a tangy, melancholic scent. It was late October, the tourist season a distant memory, and the only sounds besides Elias's work were the distant foghorn moaning from the lighthouse and the rhythmic clicking of knitting needles from Mrs. O'Malley next door.  This afternoon, however, a different sound broke the familiar rhythm – a sharp rap at the door, followed by the jingle of the bell above it, announcing an unexpected customer.
