The rusty tang of dawn hung heavy in the air as Silas Finch hammered the last nail into place, securing the flashing around a chimney stack. Below him, the city of Porthaven still slumbered, draped in pre-sunrise blues and greys.  A patchwork of terracotta rooftops stretched out to the horizon, punctuated by the occasional glint of a church spire catching the first rays of light.  Silas, perched precariously on Mrs. Gablethorpe's Victorian-era home, three stories up, felt a familiar thrill course through him.  He was a creature of the rooftops, more at home amongst the pigeons and weather vanes than on solid ground.  This morning, however, the thrill was tinged with unease.  A crumpled flyer, tucked into the crook of the chimney where a nest of starlings had abandoned it, caught his eye.  It depicted a missing person â€“ a young girl with Silas's own unusual shade of emerald green eyes.
