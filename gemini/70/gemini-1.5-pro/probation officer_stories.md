Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Anya Sharma's Ford Focus, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her. The flickering neon sign of the Lucky Dragon takeaway cast an oily, iridescent sheen across the slick asphalt of Grimshaw Lane.  Anya, her full name Anya Sharmila Sharma, tightened her grip on the steering wheel. Grimshaw Lane was the kind of place where hope came to die, a desolate strip on the outskirts of Bradford choked with pawn shops, boarded-up businesses, and the lingering scent of despair. Tonight, it was her office. Anya, a probation officer with the West Yorkshire Probation Service, was here for a mandatory check-in with one of her most volatile clients, a young man named Kai Dhillon, whose charm was as sharp and unpredictable as the broken glass littering the gutter.  He was supposed to be at the takeaway, working his court-mandated community service hours, but the only sign of life inside was the hunched figure of Mr. Chen, the owner, listlessly wiping down the counter. Anya sighed, the knot in her stomach tightening.  This wasn't good.
