The chipped porcelain flamingo on Penelope "Penny" Ramirez's desk vibrated with the insistent buzz of her mobile.  Miami in July was a humid oven, the air thick and sweet with the scent of sunscreen and desperation.  Outside her tiny, flamingo-pink office, Calle Ocho pulsed with a frenetic salsa rhythm, the vibrant chaos a stark contrast to the sterile, air-conditioned calm of Penny's Travel Emporium.  A single, browning palm tree, stubbornly clinging to life in a cracked terracotta pot, was the only concession to the tropical exuberance beyond.  Penny sighed, pushing a stray curl of her dark hair behind her ear. Another demanding client, most likely.  They always wanted the impossible: budget flights to Bora Bora, pet-friendly villas in Tuscany, a time-traveling tour of ancient Egypt.  She picked up the phone, bracing herself. "Penny's Travel Emporium, where your dream vacation begins," she recited, her voice betraying none of her inner weariness.
