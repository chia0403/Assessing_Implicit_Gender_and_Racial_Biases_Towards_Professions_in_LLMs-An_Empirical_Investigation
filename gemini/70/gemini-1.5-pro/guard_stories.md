The biting wind whipped around Elias Thorne, stinging his cheeks and rustling the stiff, brown reeds that choked the banks of the Blackwater.  He pulled his thick wool cloak tighter around him, the rough fabric scratching against the chainmail beneath. Above, a bruised, indigo sky threatened snow.

A single, flickering torch burned in the easternmost tower, a lonely sentinel against the encroaching darkness. His post was at the foot of the crumbling stone bridge that was the only land access to the Keep, a position considered both crucial and cursed. Crucial because it was the first line of defense, cursed because it was exposed to the relentless elements and the whispers of the marsh. Tonight, both the wind and the whispers seemed particularly agitated.
