The biting wind whipped Amelia “Mia” Rodriguez’s thick, brown braid against her cheek as she trudged through the ankle-deep snow covering the grounds of the Whispering Pines Animal Sanctuary.  Pine boughs, heavy with snow, drooped low, forming a hushed, green tunnel around her.  The sanctuary, nestled deep in the Colorado Rockies, was a haven for rescued wildlife, from orphaned elk calves to injured hawks. The crisp air, usually filled with the symphony of rustling leaves and bird calls, was now muffled by the thick blanket of white, broken only by the occasional mournful howl of a distant coyote.  Dawn was just beginning to paint the eastern sky a pale lavender, the snow reflecting the faint light, giving the sanctuary an ethereal, almost otherworldly glow. Mia, bundled in layers of fleece and down, exhaled a puff of frosty air that momentarily obscured her vision. Today was census day, meaning every single animal, from the smallest field mouse residing in the rehabilitation barn to the majestic grizzly bear in its vast enclosure, had to be accounted for. And Mia, the head caretaker, knew this day would be particularly challenging.
