The Nevada sun beat down on the cracked asphalt of Highway 50, baking the air to a shimmering haze.  Delilah "Dee" Jones squinted, the brim of her worn-out Stetson doing little to shield her eyes.  Her rig, a beat-up Kenworth W900 she affectionately called "The Duchess," rumbled beneath her, a low, comforting growl against the vast silence of the Nevada desert.  Dee, her calloused fingers drumming a restless rhythm on the steering wheel, was two days out of Reno, hauling a load of prefabricated housing units destined for a mining outpost somewhere near Ely.  The endless expanse of scrub brush and distant, jagged mountains stretched before her, punctuated only by the occasional bleached carcass of a long-dead animal.  A lone hawk circled overhead, a silent sentinel against the vast, unforgiving blue.  This was Dee's office, her sanctuary, a kingdom of endless road and the low hum of eighteen wheels eating up the miles.  But something felt different today, a prickle of unease beneath the familiar solitude. The radio, usually crackling with chatter from other truckers, was eerily silent.
