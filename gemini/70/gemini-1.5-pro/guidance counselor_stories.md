The fluorescent lights of Northwood High hummed a monotonous B-flat, a soundtrack to Ms. Amelia Reyesâ€™s Tuesday morning. Rain lashed against the window of her small, cluttered office, blurring the already dreary view of the school parking lot.  Amelia, her dark curls pulled back in a loose bun, tapped a chipped mug stained with the remnants of lukewarm tea.  Stacks of college brochures, aptitude tests, and half-finished scholarship applications threatened to avalanche onto her already overflowing desk. The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and teenage desperation, a familiar aroma in the hallowed halls of Northwood, a public high school clinging to the edges of suburban Chicago.  This particular Tuesday, however, felt different. A strange tension, a premonition almost, crackled beneath the usual pre-exam jitters and whispered gossip that permeated the air. Amelia couldn't shake the feeling that something significant, something disruptive, was about to happen.
