The fluorescent lights of Mrs. Eleanor Vance's kindergarten classroom hummed a monotonous tune, punctuated by the rhythmic squeak of sneakers on freshly-waxed linoleum.  Rainbow-painted cardboard letters, slightly curled at the edges from humidity, lined the walls above rows of miniature tables and chairs.  Sunshine, filtered through a thin layer of smog, cast long rectangular shapes across the brightly colored rug where a menagerie of stuffed animals sat patiently awaiting story time.  St. Jude's Academy, a small Catholic school nestled in the heart of bustling Los Angeles, had seen better days.  The once vibrant murals depicting Noah's Ark and Daniel in the Lion's Den were now faded and peeling, victims of years of underfunding and California sunshine.  It was 7:30 am, a full hour before the tiny tornadoes of energy known as kindergartners would descend, and Eleanor, armed with a lukewarm cup of coffee and a stack of construction paper, was already bracing herself.
