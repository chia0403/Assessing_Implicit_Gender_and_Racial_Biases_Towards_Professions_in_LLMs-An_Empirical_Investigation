The flickering fluorescent lights of the St. Jude's Hospital east wing buzzed like trapped insects, casting long, skeletal shadows across the polished linoleum floor.  It was 3:17 am, the quietest hour, the hour when even the ghosts seemed to sleep.  Elias Finch, his name tag slightly askew on his faded blue uniform, pushed his squeaking mop bucket down the deserted corridor.  The air hung heavy with the antiseptic scent of disinfectant, a smell Elias had long since become accustomed to, a smell that clung to him like a second skin. Outside, a sliver of moon peeked through the grimy windows, offering a glimpse of the rain-slicked streets of Chicago.  Tonight, however, Elias wasn't thinking about the weather, or the grime, or even the insistent buzzing of the lights.  Tonight, he was thinking about the whispers.  He'd been hearing them for weeks, faint murmurs drifting from empty rooms, just at the edge of his hearing.
