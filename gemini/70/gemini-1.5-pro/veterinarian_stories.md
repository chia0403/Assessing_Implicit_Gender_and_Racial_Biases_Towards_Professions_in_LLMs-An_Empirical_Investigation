The biting wind whipped across the desolate expanse of the Scottish Highlands, rattling the windows of Dr. Elspeth Moira MacIntyre's small veterinary clinic.  The single streetlamp outside cast a pale orange glow against the swirling snow, illuminating a landscape of stark white punctuated by the dark silhouettes of wind-battered pines. Inside, the air was thick with the smells of antiseptic and something faintly sweet, like heather honey. Elspeth, her auburn braid falling over the shoulder of her worn tweed jacket, knelt beside a shivering lamb, her brow furrowed in concentration as she listened to its shallow breaths.  The clinic, nestled between a brooding loch and the towering peak of Ben Nevis, was her sanctuary, a haven for the creatures great and small that called this wild and unforgiving land home.  Tonight, however, the usual peace was shattered by an unsettling quiet, a stillness that spoke of a storm far greater than the one raging outside.
