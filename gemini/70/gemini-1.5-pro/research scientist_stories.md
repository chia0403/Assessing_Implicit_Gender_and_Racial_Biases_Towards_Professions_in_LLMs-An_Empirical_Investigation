The biting Antarctic wind whipped at Dr. Aris Thorne's parka, stinging his exposed cheeks despite the thermal layers.  He adjusted his goggles, the swirling snow momentarily blinding him before clearing to reveal the stark, breathtaking landscape of the Ellsworth Mountains.  Jagged peaks, cloaked in an eternal blanket of white, pierced the iron-grey sky.  Beneath his heavy boots, the Ross Ice Shelf groaned, a low, guttural sound that resonated through the frozen air.  Aris, his breath clouding before him, checked the readings on his handheld GPS, confirming their precarious position: 80° South, 120° West, a point further inland than any research team had ever ventured.  Here, buried deep beneath the ice, lay Lake Vostok, a subglacial body of water untouched by sunlight for millions of years, and the object of Aris's relentless, decade-long obsession.
