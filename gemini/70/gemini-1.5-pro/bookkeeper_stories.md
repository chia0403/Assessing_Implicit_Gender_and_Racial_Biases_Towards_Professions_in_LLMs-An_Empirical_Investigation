The dusty, brass-plated clock above the doorway of Farthington & Sons chimed four times, a discordant clang that reverberated through the otherwise silent office.  Amelia Priscilla Finch, her spectacles perched precariously on her nose, tapped the final figures into the enormous ledger with a flourish. Outside, the November wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the grimy windowpanes of the two-story building nestled between a pawnbroker and a perpetually empty storefront in the less fashionable end of Ashworth. Ashworth itself, a town clinging to the edges of the Derbyshire moors, was a place of grey skies, greyer stone, and secrets as dark as the peat bogs that dotted the landscape.  Amelia shivered, not entirely from the cold. Something about the stillness of the office, the oppressive quiet broken only by the wind and the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner, feltâ€¦wrong.
