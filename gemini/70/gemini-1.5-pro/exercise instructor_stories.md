The relentless Miami sun beat down on Ocean Drive, turning the turquoise water into a shimmering mirage.  Salt-laced air, thick with the scent of coconut sunscreen and exhaust fumes, whipped through the open-air studio perched above the bustling sidewalk.

Sweat glistened on her tanned skin, mirroring the sheen on the polished wooden floor beneath her.  A pulsing Latin beat throbbed from the speakers, a pre-class warm-up designed to lure in the morning crowd. Izzy glanced at the handful of regulars already stretching on their mats, their faces a mixture of anticipation and mild dread. It was a Tuesday, which meant "Inferno," Izzy's signature high-intensity interval training class â€“ a fiery blend of plyometrics, cardio, and core work guaranteed to leave participants gasping for air. And Izzy, with her infectious energy and unwavering enthusiasm, wouldn't have it any other way.
