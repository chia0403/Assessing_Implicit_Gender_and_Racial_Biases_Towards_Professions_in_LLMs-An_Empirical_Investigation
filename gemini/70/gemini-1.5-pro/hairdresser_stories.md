The aroma of coconut oil and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a permanent fixture in the salon Genevieve "Gigi" Dubois owned and operated. Gigiâ€™s Hair Emporium, nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed fortune teller's parlor on Sycamore Street, was a vibrant splash of turquoise in a neighborhood otherwise muted by grey brick and the relentless Chicago wind. Rain lashed against the large front window, blurring the neon "Open" sign and casting wavering shadows on the checkerboard floor.  Inside, Motown spun softly from a vintage radio perched precariously on a stack of old Vogue magazines, the only sound competing with the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of Gigi's shears.  This Tuesday morning was slow, a stark contrast to the usual pre-weekend rush, and Gigi, her bright pink hair pulled back in a messy bun, watched the rain with a mixture of contentment and apprehension.  She knew that quiet mornings like these often preceded storms of a different kind.
