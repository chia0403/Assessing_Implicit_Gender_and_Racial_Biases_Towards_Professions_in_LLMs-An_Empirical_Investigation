The aroma of burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a bitter counterpoint to the usual symphony of yeast and cinnamon that permeated Eloise "Ellie" Cartwright's bakery.  Ellie, dusted with flour from her brow to her apron, stood frozen, staring into the gaping maw of her ancient wood-fired oven. Inside, a tray of her signature lavender and honey madeleines, usually golden and delicate, were blackened beyond recognition.  The Buttercup Bakery, nestled in the heart of the whimsical seaside town of Port Blossom, Maine, was Ellie's sanctuary, her haven, her life's work. But this morning, the sanctuary felt more like a tomb, the haven threatened, and her life's workâ€¦ well, it was currently charred to a crisp.  The salty tang of the ocean breeze, usually a comforting presence, did little to soothe the rising panic in her chest.  The annual Port Blossom Bake-Off was only two days away, and these madeleines were supposed to be her triumph.
