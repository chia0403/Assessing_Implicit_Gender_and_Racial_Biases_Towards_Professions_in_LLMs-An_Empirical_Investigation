The air hung thick and greasy with the scent of frying onions and desperation.  Neon signs, advertising everything from bail bonds to psychic readings, flickered across the rain-slicked streets of Lower Duck Pond, Oregon.  This was Beatrice "Bea" Rodriguez's kingdom. Not a kingdom of castles and courtiers, but one of leaky faucets, clogged drains, and the occasional exploding water heater. Tonight, however, promised something different.  Bea, perched precariously on a stepladder in Mrs. Higgins's powder room, wiping a smudge of pipe sealant from her cheek, felt it in the unsettling gurgle emanating from the pipes.  It wasn't the gurgle of a simple blockage.  It was deeper, moreâ€¦ resonant.  Like the plumbing itself was trying to communicate something.
