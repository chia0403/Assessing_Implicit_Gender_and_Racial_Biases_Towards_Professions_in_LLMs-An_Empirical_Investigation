Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Barnaby "Barney" Finch's office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside him.  The chipped paint on the windowsill matched the chipped enthusiasm for his chosen profession. Barney, whose full name was Barnaby Ignatius Finch, tapped a chewed-down biro against the overflowing ashtray on his desk.  His office, tucked away on the second floor of a building that had seen better centuries, overlooked the perpetually grey streets of Grimsborough, a town nestled uncomfortably between a stagnant canal and a perpetually smoking factory. The only splash of colour in the room came from a faded poster of the Grimsborough Gators, the local semi-professional cricket team, tacked haphazardly to the wall. The air hung thick with the smell of stale cigarettes and desperation â€“ a fitting aroma for an insurance salesman who hadn't closed a deal in weeks.
