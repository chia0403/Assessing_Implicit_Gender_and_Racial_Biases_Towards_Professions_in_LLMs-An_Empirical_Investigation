The biting November wind whipped around Eleanor Vance, RN, as she hurried across the deserted parking lot of St. Jude's Memorial Hospital.  The flickering sodium vapor lamps cast long, distorted shadows, making the empty cars look like slumbering beasts.  Tucked away in the shadow of the Adirondack Mountains, the small hospital usually exuded a cozy, welcoming atmosphere. But tonight, with the skeletal trees clawing at the steel-grey sky and the wind howling like a banshee, it felt isolated and exposed.  Eleanor shivered, pulling her threadbare coat tighter around her and burying her chin deeper into her scarf.  It was the end of a double shift, and all she craved was the warmth of her small cabin and the promise of a few hours of sleep before she had to do it all again. Little did she know, the night was far from over.
