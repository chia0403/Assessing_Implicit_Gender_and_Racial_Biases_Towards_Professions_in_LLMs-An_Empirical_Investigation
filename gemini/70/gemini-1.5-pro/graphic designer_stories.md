The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Elina Reyes's studio, a rhythmic counterpoint to the frantic clicking of her mouse.  Neon light from a flickering "Open" sign spilled across the slick, black asphalt of Bleecker Street, reflecting in the puddles gathering at the curb.  It was almost midnight, the kind of wet, oppressive New York City night that usually sent people scurrying for the sanctuary of their brownstones.  But Elina, hunched over her iMac in a tiny, converted garage she'd optimistically dubbed "Reyes Design," was oblivious to the downpour and the creeping hour.  Her deadline for the rebranding of "Urban Oasis," a new line of organic dog food, loomed like a rabid chihuahua, and the client, a notoriously demanding socialite, expected perfection.  The current iteration of the logo, a minimalist paw print rendered in shades of earthy green, just wasn't working. It lackedâ€¦ something.  Elina tapped a stray curl out of her eye, the faint scent of jasmine tea clinging to her worn cardigan, and sighed.  This was not how she'd envisioned her life as a successful graphic designer.
