The crimson velvet curtains of the Orpheum Theatre in New Orleans hung heavy, thick with the dust of forgotten vaudeville acts and the lingering scent of stale beer.  Rain lashed against the arched windows, a mournful counterpoint to the melancholic melody Eleanor Vance Holloway was coaxing from her battered upright piano.  The year was 1953, and the once-grand theatre, like Eleanor herself, had seen better days. Its gilded ornamentation was chipped and faded, mirroring the wear and tear on Eleanorâ€™s once-vibrant spirit.  Moonlight, fractured by the raindrops, painted fleeting silver streaks across the empty, cavernous space, illuminating only the dust motes dancing in the single spotlight trained on Eleanor and her lonely instrument. Tonight, her only audience was a slumbering, ginger tomcat curled up on a tattered velvet cushion, and perhaps, the ghosts of performers past.
