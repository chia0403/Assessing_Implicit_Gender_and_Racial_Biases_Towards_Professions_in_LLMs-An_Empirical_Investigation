Rain lashed against the attic window, a frantic percussion accompanying the rhythmic click-clack of Amelia Thorne's typewriter.  Dust motes, disturbed by the drafts snaking through the ill-fitting glass, danced in the single beam of light cast by a battered brass lamp.  The attic room, nestled beneath the eaves of her rambling Victorian home in Hollow Creek, Maine, usually served as Ameliaâ€™s sanctuary. Tonight, however, the familiar scent of old paper and leather-bound books did little to soothe the gnawing anxiety that twisted in her gut.  Her latest novel, a gothic thriller titled "The Whispers of Blackwood Manor," was due to her publisher in three weeks, and the final chapter remained stubbornly elusive.  The words, usually so readily at her command, now seemed to mock her from the blank page, as unyielding as the granite cliffs that guarded the coastline just beyond the town limits.
