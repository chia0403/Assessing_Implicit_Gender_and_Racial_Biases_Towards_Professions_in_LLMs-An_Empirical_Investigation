Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Elias Thorne's apartment, mirroring the storm brewing inside his head.  Twenty-two stories above the neon-drenched sprawl of Neo-Kyoto, his usually pristine workspace was a chaotic landscape of empty ramen containers, energy drink cans, and tangled cables snaking across the polished concrete floor.  Lines of code, glowing a spectral green on his multiple monitors, scrolled relentlessly, a digital waterfall reflecting the cascade of Elias's increasingly frantic thoughts.  The deadline for Project Chimera, the revolutionary AI he'd poured the last six months of his life into, was in forty-eight hours, and the damn thing still refused to recognize the difference between a cat and a cauliflower.  Outside, the holographic billboards advertising everything from cybernetic limb enhancements to personalized dreamscapes flickered intermittently, swallowed by the downpour.  Inside, Elias rubbed his bleary eyes, the reflection of the code painting his face in an eerie green glow, and knew, with a sinking feeling, that he was in deep trouble.
