The salt-laced wind whipped at Elara Thistlewick's easel, threatening to tear the canvas from its moorings.  She gripped it tighter, her knuckles white against the worn wood, squinting at the tumultuous grey sky above the churning Irish Sea.  Below her, nestled against the dramatic cliffs of Howth Head, sat the tiny, brightly-painted village of Balscadden.  Its miniature houses, a riot of blues, greens, and reds, clung to the hillside like stubborn barnacles, seemingly oblivious to the storm brewing on the horizon.  Elara, perched precariously on a grassy knoll overlooking the scene, inhaled deeply, the sharp scent of brine mingling with the sweeter fragrance of wildflowers clinging to life in the crevices of the rocks.  This was her haven, her muse, the source of the vibrant, almost violently beautiful landscapes that flowed from her brush.  Today, however, the usual inspiration eluded her.  A disquiet hung in the air, a tension that mirrored the roiling sea, and Elara couldn't shake the feeling that something was about to change.
