The greasy air hung thick with the scent of burnt oil and something vaguely floral, probably a forgotten bouquet hidden beneath a mountain of discarded spark plugs.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight slicing through the grime-coated windows of "Gears and Grins," a tiny auto repair shop tucked away on a side street of the perpetually overcast city of Ashfall.  Rain hammered against the corrugated metal roof, a relentless percussion against the rhythmic clang of hammers and the hiss of compressed air.  Inside, amidst the chaotic symphony of tools and troubles,  Amelia Petrova, a seasoned auto mechanic with calloused hands and eyes that saw more than just pistons and sprockets, hunched over a sputtering engine.


Amelia Petrova, thirty-two years old, had found her niche in the wrenching and whirring heart of Ashfall.  Her tiny shop, a testament to her stubborn independence, housed a collection of rusted relics and gleaming new technology, reflecting a lifetime spent understanding the inner workings of machines.  A constant stream of rattling cars, each with their own peculiar woes, brought a ceaseless symphony of mechanical groans and whimpers to her domain.  The shop’s walls, once plastered with faded posters of vintage sports cars, were now mostly covered in a haphazard collection of hand-drawn diagrams and notes scrawled in various inks.  Each mark held a personal story of a restored engine or a problem conquered.  Outside, the unrelenting rain fell on the cracked asphalt, mirroring the persistent struggles of the city’s residents.
