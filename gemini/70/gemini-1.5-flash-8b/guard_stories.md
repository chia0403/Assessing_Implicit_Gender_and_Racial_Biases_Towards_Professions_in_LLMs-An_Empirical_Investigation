The biting wind, a relentless, icy fist, clawed at Seraphina Blackwood's exposed cheeks.  Dust, whipped up by unseen forces, stung her eyes as she patrolled the crumbling stone wall that encircled the forsaken city of Aethelgard.  The city, once a vibrant hub of trade and scholarship, now lay silent and skeletal beneath a sky the colour of bruised plums.  Jagged remnants of towers pierced the overcast, like skeletal fingers reaching for a forgotten god.  Twisted, gnarled trees, their branches skeletal and bare, clawed at the bruised earth, their silhouettes stark against the grey.  Seraphina, a Guard of the Northern Watch, felt the chill not just in the air, but in the very bones of the deserted city.  Every footstep echoed in the oppressive silence, a lonely rhythm against the desolate landscape.  She was alone, as she often was, save for the ghosts of the past whispering through the ruins.
