The flickering neon sign of the Rusty Mug cast a sickly yellow glow on Amelia Juniper’s face, highlighting the weariness etched into her tired eyes.  Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof, mimicking the relentless drumming of her own thoughts.  The small, greasy spoon diner was practically deserted save for a lone figure slumped over a booth in the back, the only other sound besides the rain the rhythmic clatter of Amelia's own chipped mug as she polished it.  The air hung thick with the smell of stale coffee and something vaguely…metallic.  It was a scent that clung to her, a constant companion in this forgotten corner of the town.  This was the only place in Havenwood that stayed open past midnight, a place as forlorn as the deserted streets beyond its faded facade.  Amelia, a server at the Rusty Mug for the past three years, knew its secrets as well as the grease stains on its worn linoleum floor.
