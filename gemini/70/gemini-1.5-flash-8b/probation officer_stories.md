Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the probation office, a relentless rhythm that mirrored the pounding headache gnawing at Amelia Blackwood's temples.  The fluorescent lights flickered, casting long, distorted shadows across the cluttered desk.

Outside, the grey London sky mirrored the bleakness of the case files piled precariously high on the desk:  Liam O’Connell, 23, petty theft,  third offence.  Amelia sighed, the sound lost in the tempestuous drumming.  This wasn’t just another case; it felt like a persistent, unwelcome raincloud threatening to engulf her entire existence.  The probation office, a cramped, anonymous space tucked away on a side street of Bethnal Green, felt as cold and damp as the city itself.
