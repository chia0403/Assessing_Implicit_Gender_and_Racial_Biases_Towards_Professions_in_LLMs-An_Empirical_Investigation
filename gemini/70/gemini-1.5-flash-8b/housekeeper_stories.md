The chipped porcelain sink, stained a dull, perpetual beige, held the weight of Amelia Hawthorne's weary hands.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun piercing the gloom of the sprawling manor, casting long, skeletal shadows across the polished parquet floor.  Amelia, her name barely a whisper against the echoing silence of Blackwood Manor, scrubbed at a stubborn smear of gravy.  She’d been at it for the better part of an hour, the rhythmic clatter of the scouring brush a monotonous counterpoint to the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the hall.  The air, thick with the scent of aged wood and something indefinably...musty, hung heavy in the cavernous kitchen, a place where yesterday's meals still seemed to linger.  Blackwood Manor had been her domain for the past seven years, a labyrinthine fortress, and today, its silence was suffocating.  She’d cleaned countless rooms, polished countless surfaces, but this particular stain, like the rest of the house, felt impossibly deep-seated.
