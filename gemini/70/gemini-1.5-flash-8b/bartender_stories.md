The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow across Amelia "Ames"  Fitzwilliam's face, highlighting the faint smudges of dark eyeliner that barely concealed the exhaustion etched into her eyes.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless percussion that mirrored the relentless rhythm of the drinks she poured. The air in the dimly lit bar, thick with the smells of stale beer, cheap cigarettes, and something vaguely floral that clung to the wilting potted ivy hanging from the rafters, felt heavy.  It pressed down on Ames, almost tangible.

The setting:  The Rusty Mug was a dive bar tucked away in the grimy back alleys of a city known for its fading grandeur.  Rain-slicked cobblestones and chipped paint adorned the narrow streets, reflecting the city's own weary sigh.  Inside, the bar itself was a monument to neglect, a worn collection of mismatched stools and tables, their surfaces scarred with countless stories â€“ stories told in spilled drinks, whispered secrets, and the clinking of ice against glass.  The rhythmic drip of the leaky faucet in the back seemed to hum a melancholic tune against the backdrop of whispered conversations and the muted roar of the city outside.
