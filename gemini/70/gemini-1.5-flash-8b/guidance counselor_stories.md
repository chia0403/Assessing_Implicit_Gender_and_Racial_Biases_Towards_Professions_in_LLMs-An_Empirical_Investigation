The fluorescent lights of the Northwood High guidance office hummed, a relentless, white noise that mirrored the anxiety swirling in Amelia Blackwood's gut.  Her beige cubicle, perpetually littered with crumpled papers and half-eaten granola bars, felt smaller than usual.  Today, the air crackled with a palpable tension, a pre-storm stillness before the inevitable teenage tempest.  October's crisp chill seeped through the thin fabric of the oversized window blinds, mirroring the icy dread that had settled in Amelia's stomach.  Outside, the sprawling campus, normally buzzing with the vibrant chaos of high school life, seemed subdued, as if holding its breath.  This was the week of the college application crunch, and Amelia, Northwood High's lone guidance counselor for the past five years, knew the weight of these impending choices.  She was a seasoned professional, but the cumulative anxieties of a hundred anxious students felt heavy on her shoulders. The posters plastered on the walls—a collage of colleges, scholarships, and motivational quotes—seemed mocking, their bright colours a cruel contrast to the grey reality of her present.
