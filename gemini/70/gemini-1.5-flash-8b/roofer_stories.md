The biting wind, a relentless, icy shard, whipped at Silas Blackwood's weathered face, stinging his exposed cheeks.  He gripped the rusted metal rung of the scaffold, the rhythmic clang of falling gravel a constant, muted percussion against the symphony of the storm.  Below him, the sprawling, grey Victorian mansion, known locally as Blackwood Manor, seemed to writhe under the assault of the elements.  Jagged shards of ice clung to the eaves, threatening to send a cascade of frozen water crashing down on the already treacherous rooftop. Silas, a roofer for twenty years, knew this was no ordinary storm.  This was a tempest designed to test, even break, the very bones of the house.

Setting: Blackwood Manor, a sprawling, imposing Victorian mansion perched atop a hill overlooking the town of Ashwood.  Its many gables and ornate chimneys, once a testament to the grandeur of the Blackwood family, were now weathered and worn, battling against the relentless forces of nature.  Ashwood itself, nestled in a valley below, huddled beneath a sky the colour of bruised plum, as if preparing for a long winter's sleep.  The air was thick with the smell of damp earth and pine needles, a scent familiar and comforting to Silas, despite the harshness of the present storm.
