The flickering neon sign of "Bartholomew's Bold Plumbing" cast a sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked cobblestones of  Old Willow Creek.  Twisted ivy, clinging precariously to the ancient stone buildings, seemed to whisper secrets in the wind that howled through the narrow alleyways.  Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, a man whose grease-stained overalls had absorbed more grime than a sewer rat's burrow, hunched over a leaky pipe outside the "Whispering Willow" tavern.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless percussion against the backdrop of the town's ceaseless murmur.  Barty, his brow furrowed in concentration, listened intently to the gurgling, groaning symphony of the plumbing system beneath his feet.  He adjusted the wrench in his calloused hand, the rhythmic clang a counterpoint to the escalating symphony.  The town's peculiar rhythm, a blend of ancient crafts and modern technology, was today punctuated by the urgent need for a quick fix.
