The wind, a relentless sculptor of its own, whipped grit and shards of grey stone into Elias Thorne's face as he chipped away at the colossal, weathered flank of Mount Veridian.  Sunlight, fractured and filtered through the swirling clouds, painted the mountainside in shifting hues of ochre and amethyst.  Elias, a stone cutter of the Emerald Valley, was a man sculpted by the very rock he wielded.  His hands, gnarled and calloused, were stained a permanent sepia, his eyes, the colour of chipped jade, bore the quiet wisdom of a thousand years carved into the mountain's heart.  He worked with a rhythmic precision, a dancer in the shadow of the mountain, each blow of his hammer echoing in the vast, echoing silence of the valley.  Around him, the valley floor was a mosaic of ancient, abandoned stone quarries.  Twisted, forgotten figures of mythical beasts and long-dead gods, fragments of a forgotten empire, lay scattered like discarded puzzle pieces.  Elias lived and worked in the heart of this forgotten land, a keeper of secrets buried within the very stones.
