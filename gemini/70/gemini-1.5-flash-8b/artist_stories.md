The chipped paint of the "Artist's Asylum" sign, a faded, emerald green, barely held onto its moorings.  Rain slicked the cobblestones outside, reflecting the sickly yellow light of a November dusk.  Inside, Amelia Blackwood, a young artist with eyes the colour of storm clouds and hair the shade of burnt umber, hunched over her easel.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom, illuminating the half-finished portrait of a woman with eyes that seemed to follow her across the room.  The woman, whose name was never mentioned, merely hinted at some vast, unspoken sorrow.

Amelia's studio, nestled deep within the heart of the forgotten district of Alderbrook, was a cramped space, barely bigger than a walk-in closet.  Damp seeped through the crumbling plaster, clinging to the canvases that lined the walls like mourning shrouds.  The air hung heavy with the scent of turpentine and damp earth, a pungent perfume that clung to Amelia like a second skin.  Outside, the rhythmic drumming of rain against the attic window matched the relentless drumming in her own head, a relentless rhythm that accompanied the relentless pressure to create.  Each brushstroke, each colour, was a tiny act of rebellion against the relentless pull of despair, the ghosts of lost dreams that haunted her every waking moment.  This was her sanctuary, her battlefield, and her prison.
