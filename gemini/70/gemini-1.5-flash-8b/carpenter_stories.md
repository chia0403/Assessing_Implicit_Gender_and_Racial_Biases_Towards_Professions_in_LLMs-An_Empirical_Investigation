The biting wind whipped Elias Thorne's beard across his weathered face, stinging his eyes as he hammered a final nail into the intricate oak support beam.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom of the workshop, illuminating the nearly completed grandfather clock.  He breathed a sigh of satisfaction, the scent of aged wood and linseed oil filling his lungs.  Elias Thorne, carpenter extraordinaire of Oakhaven, had once again exceeded expectations.  He glanced around the small, cluttered space.  Tools, meticulously arranged in their respective wooden compartments, lined the walls.  A half-finished wooden birdhouse perched precariously on a workbench, mocking the almost-complete masterpiece that was the clock.  Each creak and groan of the workshop, each whisper of the wind howling outside the small, single-pane window, seemed to hold a story within itself, as old and intricate as the clock he'd crafted.  Oakhaven, a village nestled deep within the whispering forests of the Blackwood Hills, was known for its quiet beauty and its even quieter residents. But today, Elias sensed a shift in the air. A subtle tremor beneath the quiet, a premonition of something more than the usual gentle rustle of leaves and the occasional hoot of an owl.
