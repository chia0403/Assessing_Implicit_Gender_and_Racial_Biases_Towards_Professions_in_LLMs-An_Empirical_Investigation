The scent of beeswax and aged linen hung heavy in the air of Elias Thorne's workshop, a testament to the years of painstaking work that had gone into its creation.

A delicate chime, like wind chimes struck by a phantom hand, drifted in from the grand estate across the way, a stark contrast to the quiet focus of the small shop.  Elias, a man weathered by the countless hours spent crafting garments for the city's elite, felt a persistent unease settle within him, a prickling sensation that tugged at the threads of his composure. Today, an unusual request had arrived, one that felt oddlyâ€¦weighted.
