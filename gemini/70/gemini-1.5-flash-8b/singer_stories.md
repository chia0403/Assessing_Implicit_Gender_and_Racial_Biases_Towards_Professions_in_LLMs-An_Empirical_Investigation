The chipped paint of the "Velvet Rose" cabaret clung to the rain-slicked cobblestones, mirroring the melancholy clinging to Isolde Nightingale’s heart.  The air, thick with the scent of jasmine and cheap perfume, hung heavy over the Parisian alleyway, a stark contrast to the shimmering lights beckoning from within.  Isolde, her name a whispered promise of something beautiful and fragile, traced the damp brick with a fingertip, the melody of a forgotten song echoing in her ears.  She was a phantom in the city of lights, a singer swallowed by the shadows, her voice a whispered secret only the rain seemed to hear.  Tonight, however, the velvet curtain of the "Velvet Rose" held the promise of a different kind of silence—a silence pregnant with the potential for a powerful performance.
