Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the dilapidated school building, a relentless drumming that mirrored the anxiety thrumming in Dr. Eleanor Vanceâ€™s chest.  The air, thick with the scent of mildew and damp earth, clung to her like a second skin.  This wasn't the pristine, modern school she'd envisioned when she'd accepted the position as school psychologist at Oakhaven Elementary.

The school itself, a relic from a bygone era, seemed to whisper tales of forgotten dreams and unfulfilled promises.  Deserted classrooms, their windows like vacant eyes staring out at the tumultuous landscape, were scattered throughout the aging structure.  Today, however, the only sounds besides the relentless rain were the muffled sobs emanating from the tiny, cluttered office nestled at the far end of the building.  It was a sound that resonated far deeper than the storm.
