The wind, a relentless, whispering beast, whipped across the parched plains of the Colorado Territory.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of ochre and tan, danced across the cracked earth, swirling the scent of sagebrush and despair into Elias Thorne's nostrils.  He squinted, the midday sun glinting off the oxidized metal of his worn saddle.  His name, Elias Thorne, echoed the strength and resilience of the land he called home, a land that seemed to be slowly, relentlessly, consuming itself.  The year was 1887.

The setting sun cast long shadows across the sprawling cattle ranch, "The Last Stand," a name ironic given the dwindling herd and the encroaching pressures of the railroads and towns that seemed to sprout like weeds in the desolate landscape.  The ranch itself was a testament to the past â€“ weathered wooden buildings, their paint peeling like sunburnt skin, huddled around a well that offered only meager respite from the oppressive heat.  A single, skeletal windmill, its arms groaning in protest against the relentless wind, stood as a solitary sentinel against the vast expanse of emptiness.  A lone hawk circled overhead, its sharp eyes scanning the horizon for any signs of prey, just like Elias's own keen gaze.  The land, once rich and fertile, now felt like a dying breath.  The only life left seemed to be found in the defiant strength of the scattered cattle, struggling to survive in the unforgiving heat.
