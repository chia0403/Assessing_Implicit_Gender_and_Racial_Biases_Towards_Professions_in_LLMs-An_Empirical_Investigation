The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air of "Scissors & Sorcery," a tiny salon nestled between a bakery overflowing with the aroma of freshly baked croissants and a bustling antique shop.  Sunlight, fractured by the ornate stained-glass window depicting a winged unicorn, cast long, dancing shadows across the polished floors.  Amelia Nightingale, a hairdresser with hands as swift and precise as hummingbird wings, meticulously teased a strand of auburn hair, her brow furrowed in concentration.  The rhythmic click of her clippers and the soft murmur of conversations from clients created a comforting, almost hypnotic hum.  Today, however, the usual symphony was punctuated by an unsettling quiet.  Outside, the city, usually a cacophony of horns and hurried footsteps, felt muted, almost hushed.  Amelia sensed an impending storm, not just of rain, but of something more profound.
