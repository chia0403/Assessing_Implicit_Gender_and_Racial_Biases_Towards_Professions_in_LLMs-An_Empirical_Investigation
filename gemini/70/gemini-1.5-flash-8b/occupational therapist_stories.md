The chipped paint of the Victorian-era front door, a faded, sickly green, seemed to mock Amelia Kensington, Occupational Therapist.  Rain hammered against the corrugated metal awning, mirroring the relentless drumming in her ears.  Inside, the cavernous, dimly lit waiting room of Willow Creek Rehabilitation Centre hummed with a low, anxious energy, a symphony of sighs and shuffling feet.  A single bare bulb cast long, skeletal shadows across the worn floral wallpaper, highlighting the dust motes dancing in the humid air.  The scent of antiseptic hung heavy, a stark contrast to the floral-scented hand cream Amelia had meticulously applied before entering.  Today, the scent felt more like a suffocating shroud.


Amelia, her trench coat a muted grey against the drab d√©cor, adjusted her glasses.  A constellation of tiny, almost invisible worry lines etched themselves around her eyes.  Thirty-five, but looking far older, the weight of the past weeks pressed down on her shoulders, manifesting as a knot of tension in her jaw.  Each patient represented a unique chapter in the ongoing narrative of Willow Creek, a tapestry woven with stories of fragility, resilience, and the insidious dance between hope and despair.
