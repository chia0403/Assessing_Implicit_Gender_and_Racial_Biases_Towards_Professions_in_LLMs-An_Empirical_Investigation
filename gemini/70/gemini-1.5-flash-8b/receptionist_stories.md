The fluorescent lights of the "Apex Innovations" reception area hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia Graystone’s life.  Empty coffee cups, chipped from countless lukewarm lattes, littered the worn laminate table.  A half-eaten granola bar, abandoned mid-crunch, lay nestled beside a stack of urgent-looking memos.  Amelia, a slender woman with perpetually tired eyes, sighed, pushing another folder onto the overflowing pile.  The air smelled faintly of stale printer toner and the faint, almost imperceptible, scent of ozone.  The reception area, situated in a nondescript office building on the outskirts of the city, was a study in muted colours and overwhelming paperwork.  Sunlight, filtered through grimy windows, cast long, distorted shadows across the room. The muted beige walls were punctuated by a large, slightly faded corporate logo: APEX INNOVATIONS – Pioneering the Future, the slogan seeming ironic in the face of the endless stream of mundane requests.  Today, as always, the waiting room was populated by a seemingly endless line of harried-looking employees.
