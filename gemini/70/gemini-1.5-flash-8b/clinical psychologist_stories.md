Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Dr. Eleanor Vance's clinic, a relentless tattoo that mirrored the insistent drumming in her head.  The flickering fluorescent lights cast long, distorted shadows across the sterile waiting room, each one a potential metaphor for the fractured psyches she so often encountered.  Eleanor Vance, a clinical psychologist with a decade of experience, was undeniably brilliant, but lately, her own inner world felt more like a labyrinth than a well-ordered framework.  The small, cluttered office, tucked away on a side street in the perpetually overcast town of Ashwood, was a microcosm of her own emotional state:  organized but with a sense of impending chaos.  Empty coffee cups and scattered papers littered her desk, silent witnesses to countless late nights wrestling with case files and her own growing anxieties. The scent of ozone, a familiar companion in her life, hung heavy in the air, a testament to the relentless energy of the machines in the adjoining electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) unit, a stark reminder of the desperate measures some of her patients were forced to undertake.
