The chill of the November air bit at Bartholomew "Barty" Grimshaw's exposed cheeks, seeping into the very marrow of his bones.  He pulled his worn leather apron tighter, the scent of woodsmoke and aged blood clinging to him like a second skin.  The cobbled street, slick with a thin sheen of rain-glazed ice, reflected the flickering gaslight hanging precariously from the crooked, timber-framed buildings of Whitestone.  The air itself seemed thick with the unspoken stories of the town, whispers of lost loves and whispered secrets, all muted by the rhythmic thud of Barty’s cleaver against the meat block.

Barty Grimshaw, butcher extraordinaire of Whitestone’s only establishment, "Grimshaw's Good Cuts," was a man carved from the very same granite that formed the town's foundations.  His hands, gnarled and scarred from years of wielding the steel, possessed a strength that belied his lean frame.  Each cut he made was a dance, a symphony of controlled violence, a testament to his unwavering skill and, perhaps, his quiet rage.  Inside the shop, the fragrant gloom of the freshly-slaughtered animals hung heavy, punctuated by the sharp tang of spices and the rhythmic squelch of the juices pooling on the blood-stained flagstones.  Outside, the howling wind seemed to mock the meager warmth radiating from the shop's single, flickering lamp.
