The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual, sickly yellow, reflected the flickering gaslight outside the Grand Victoria Hotel.  A single, dusty brass bell hung limply from the wall, a stark contrast to the opulent grandeur the hotel professed.  Twenty-year-old Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, his starched uniform a testament to a misplaced sense of pride, stared at the reflection.  His eyes, usually bright with a youthful optimism, now held a dull weariness that spoke volumes about the monotonous routine of bell-hopping.  The Grand Victoria, with its towering facade and echoing hallways, felt less like a monument to luxury and more like a mausoleum of unspoken anxieties.

The setting:  1920s New York City.  The Grand Victoria Hotel, a grand, yet subtly decaying, establishment on a bustling side street just off of Fifth Avenue.  Whispers of speakeasies and illegal activities drifted through the hotel's antiquated ventilation systems, adding a layer of unspoken tension to the otherwise stiff propriety of the clientele.  Dust motes danced in the weak gaslight, mimicking the swirling anxieties of the hotel staff, caught between the opulent display of wealth and the ever-present threat of the city's underbelly.
