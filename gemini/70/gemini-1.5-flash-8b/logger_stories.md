The biting wind, a relentless claw, ripped at Elias Thorneâ€™s flannel shirt.  He hunched deeper into the shadowed alcove beneath the skeletal remains of a towering redwood, the air thick with the smell of pine needles and damp earth.  The jagged peaks of the Cascade Mountains loomed around him, their granite faces slick with ice, mirroring the icy fear that snaked through Elias's veins.  He was lost.  Not just lost in the labyrinthine forests of the Olympic National Park, but lost in a deeper, more insidious way.  It had been three days since the storm, three days since the avalanche had buried his truck and everything in it but a worn leather-bound journal.  Now, the relentless march of the winter had pressed him to this bleak, forgotten corner of the forest.

The setting was the rugged, unforgiving landscape of the Olympic National Park, Washington State.  Snow-laden trees clawed at a bruised, gray sky, their branches groaning under the weight of the winter storm.  Frozen waterfalls cascaded down rocky slopes, creating a symphony of ice and despair.  The forest floor, a chaotic carpet of fallen branches and splintered logs, was barely visible beneath a deep layer of snow.  Elias, a grizzled logger with eyes the colour of stormy sea, was a man accustomed to the wilderness, yet this place, this storm, this isolation, felt different. A primal terror thrummed beneath the surface of the forest, an echo of the avalanche that had taken everything he held dear.
