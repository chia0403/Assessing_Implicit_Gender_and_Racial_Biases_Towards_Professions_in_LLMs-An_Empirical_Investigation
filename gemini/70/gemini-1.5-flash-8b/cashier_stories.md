The fluorescent lights of the "Corner Mart" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Butterfield's life.  Dust motes danced in the pale glow, illuminating the rows of meticulously arranged canned goods, the faded posters advertising last week's specials, and the chipped linoleum floor that seemed to absorb the faint sounds of the town itself.  Amelia, a young woman with eyes the colour of a stormy sea and hair the shade of burnt caramel, stared blankly at the barcode scanner, a single, chipped nail catching the light.  It was 2:17 AM, the deadest hour of the Corner Mart's deadest day.  The only sound louder than the hum of the fluorescent lights was the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Amelia's own heart, a frantic drum solo in the otherwise silent store.
