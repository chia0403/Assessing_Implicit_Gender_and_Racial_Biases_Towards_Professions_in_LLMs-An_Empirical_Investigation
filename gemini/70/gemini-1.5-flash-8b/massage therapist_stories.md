Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Willow Creek Massage, a small, dimly lit storefront tucked between a secondhand bookstore and a bakery that always smelled faintly of cinnamon.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of lavender and sandalwood, a stark contrast to the relentless downpour outside.  Amelia Josephine Blackwood, her fingers still stained a muted shade of lavender from the previous client's essential oil, sighed, stretching out a tired hand.  The rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the rain against the roof was a constant, insistent counterpoint to the quiet hum of the room, the gentle thrum of the flickering fluorescent light above her.  A single, bare bulb cast long shadows across the polished wooden floor, highlighting the faint dust motes dancing in the air.  Tonight, the only other sound was the soft, rhythmic clicking of her fingers as she adjusted the tension in her shoulders, a familiar prelude to another long night of easing the burdens of others.
