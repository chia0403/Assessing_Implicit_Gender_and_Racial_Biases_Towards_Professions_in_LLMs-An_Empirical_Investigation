The flickering fluorescent lights of Dr. Eleanor Vance’s dental office hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic click-clack of her drill.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grime-streaked window, illuminating the chipped porcelain figurines scattered across her cluttered desk.  Eleanor, a woman whose sharp eyes and precise movements belied a quiet intensity, focused intently on the patient's aching molar.  The room, a symphony of sterile white and faded floral wallpaper, smelled faintly of antiseptic and old coffee.  A faded poster advertising "Healthy Smiles for a Healthy You" hung listlessly above the reception desk, its vibrancy dulled by years of neglect.  Eleanor’s meticulously maintained, if slightly chaotic, practice was located in the heart of a rapidly gentrifying neighborhood, a stark contrast to the working-class families who had populated the area for decades.  This particular afternoon, however, felt strangely quiet.  Not the usual low hum of conversation and the clatter of instruments, but a stillness that pressed down on her like a suffocating blanket. This was not just another Tuesday; something felt different about this patient.
