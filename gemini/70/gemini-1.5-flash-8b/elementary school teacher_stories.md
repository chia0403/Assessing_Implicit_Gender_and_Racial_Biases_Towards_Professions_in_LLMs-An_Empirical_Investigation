The chipped paint of the classroom walls, a faded shade of robin's egg blue, seemed to sigh with the afternoon humidity.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the grime-coated window, illuminating a chaotic symphony of crayons, glitter glue, and half-finished drawings.  Eleven-year-old Amelia "Amy" Johnson, a whirlwind of nervous energy, meticulously traced a leaf, her brow furrowed in concentration.  This was Ms. Eleanor Vance's third-grade class at Maplewood Elementary, a school where the faded glory of yesteryear struggled to keep pace with the relentless march of progress.

The air hung thick with the scent of freshly-baked cookies, a tempting aroma that only intensified the gnawing hunger pangs Amelia felt.  She'd skipped breakfast, a habit as predictable as the afternoon's inevitable tantrum from her younger brother, Leo.  Ms. Vance, her well-worn cardigan draped over her shoulders, leaned against the chipped wooden desk, a quiet contemplation settling over her.  Her name was Eleanor Vance, but most of her students just called her Miss Vance.  She had been a third-grade teacher for twelve years, a tenure that felt like both a lifetime and a blink of an eye, depending on the day.  The rustling of papers and the hushed murmur of children's voices were the soundtrack of her life.  Today, though, the usual cacophony held a peculiar stillness, a premonition of something stirring in the heart of the mundane.
