The clatter of knives against steel, a symphony of controlled chaos, filled the air of "Le Petit Coq."  Chef Antoine Dubois, a man whose face bore the perpetual weariness of a storm-tossed sailor, meticulously sliced a radish, each petal falling with a satisfying *plink* onto a pristine white porcelain board.  Outside, the grey London sky mirrored the mood in the restaurant: a muted drizzle clung to the cobblestones, reflecting the muted, almost melancholic glow of the gas lamps that lined the narrow street.  Antoine, hunched over his station, was a study in quiet intensity, his brow furrowed in concentration, his eyes darting between the precise cut of the radish and the swirling mist outside.  Rain, in fact, was the only thing on his mind that wasn't the dish in front of him.
