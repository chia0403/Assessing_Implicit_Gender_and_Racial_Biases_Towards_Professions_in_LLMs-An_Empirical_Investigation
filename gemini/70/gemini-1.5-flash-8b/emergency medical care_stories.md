The biting wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vance's lab coat around her legs, stinging her cheeks with icy particles.  The flickering sodium lights of the deserted highway patrol station cast long, skeletal shadows across the snow-dusted parking lot.  A skeletal figure, barely visible under a mountain of powdery white, lay sprawled on the hard-packed snow just beyond the gravel pit.  Eleanor, her breath misting in the frigid air, adjusted her gloves and pulled her hood tighter.  This wasn't the glamorous trauma scene she'd envisioned in medical school.  This was a frozen wasteland, the kind that whispered tales of lonely stretches and sudden, silent tragedies.  It was the kind of place where the only sound, besides the relentless howl of the wind, was the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of her own heart against her ribs, a counterpoint to the stillness of the night.  

**Setting:** A remote stretch of rural highway in the northern US, early winter.  The highway patrol station, small and dilapidated, sits alone amidst the vast, unforgiving expanse of snow-covered fields and scrubby pine trees. The air is frigid, the landscape stark and desolate.
