Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the small clinic, mimicking the frantic rhythm of Amelia Hayesâ€™s heart.  The fluorescent lights hummed, casting a sterile glow on the cluttered examination room.  Damp air hung heavy, carrying the scent of antiseptic and something vaguely floral, likely from the wilting potted geraniums on the windowsill.  Outside, the sprawling, grey-green landscape of the Blackwood Valley, usually vibrant with the colours of autumn, was shrouded in a suffocating gloom.  Amelia, a physical therapist with sharp, tired eyes and a perpetually rumpled cardigan, crouched beside a young man named Leo, his face pale and drawn in the weak light.  She gently guided his injured ankle through a series of painstaking exercises, her touch light and deliberate, as the rhythmic drumming of the rain seemed to echo the aching throb in Leo's leg.  The air crackled with unspoken tension, a tangible weight pressing down on them both.  This was far from the bright, bustling city physiotherapy clinics Amelia had been used to.  This was Blackwood Valley, a remote community where the only thing more prevalent than the mist was the weight of unspoken secrets and forgotten stories.
