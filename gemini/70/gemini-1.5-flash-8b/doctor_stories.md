The biting wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vance's lab coat around her legs as she hurried across the deserted campus of Blackwood University.  Snow, thick and clinging, coated the ancient oaks, their skeletal branches reaching out like gnarled fingers against the bruised grey sky.  The campus, normally a vibrant hub of academic life, felt eerily still.  This wasn't just the quiet of a late-winter Tuesday; this was the hushed stillness of somethingâ€¦ waiting.

The chipped paint of the biology building, a testament to years of neglect, reflected the sickly yellow glow of the flickering sodium lights casting long, dancing shadows.  Eleanor, her breath fogging in the frigid air, keyed the heavy metal door, the sound echoing unnaturally loud in the silence.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of formaldehyde and something else, something acrid and vaguely metallic, a smell that clung to the back of her throat like a phantom memory.  The lab, normally a meticulously organized space, was a jumble of scattered equipment and half-finished experiments.  This wasn't the chaos of a frantic night; this was the precise disorder of something deliberately left exposed.  A single, crimson-stained microscope slide lay on the lab bench, illuminated by a shaft of light slicing through the gloom, revealing a microscopic image that seemed to pulse with a malevolent energy.
