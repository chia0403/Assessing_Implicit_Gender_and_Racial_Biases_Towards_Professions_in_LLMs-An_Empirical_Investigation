Amy, her name a whisper against the murmur of cicadas, sighed.  Another Tuesday, another stubbornly uncooperative client.  The meticulously landscaped gardens of the opulent Blackwood Manor were no match for the relentless summer heat, and her efforts to tame the overgrown jungle felt like a Sisyphean task.

The year is 2024.  The air hung thick with the scent of honeysuckle and damp earth. Blackwood Manor, a grand, imposing house with a slate roof that mirrored the grey sky above, loomed on a hill overlooking a valley filled with emerald fields.  Amy, a small, determined woman with a tangle of auburn hair that often fell into her eyes, stood at the edge of the overgrown garden, surveying the chaos.  A single, defiant rosebush, its crimson blooms clinging to life, was the only sign of beauty in the oppressive greenery.
