The fluorescent lights of the "Sweat Equity" gym buzzed, a soundtrack to the rhythmic thump of Amelia "Sparky"  Sparks's bass-heavy playlist.  Dripping sweat, her own reflection stared back from the polished chrome of the cardio equipment.  At 32, Sparky had carved a niche for herself, not just as a certified personal trainer, but as a motivational force of nature within the bustling metropolis of Zenith City.  Her clients, a mix of corporate drones, struggling artists, and eccentric retirees, swore by her ability to push them to their limits and then celebrate with them.  But tonight, the air hung heavy with a different kind of tension.

The gym, usually a symphony of grunts and exhales, was eerily quiet.  A single, almost imperceptible hum, like a fly trapped in a vacuum, seemed to emanate from the back of the room, near the weightlifting section.  The scent of ozone, usually a welcome companion, today carried an undercurrent of something metallic, something...unnatural. Zenith City, a concrete jungle of towering skyscrapers and bustling streets, was usually a vibrant mix of light and energy, but tonight a creeping unease settled over Sparky, mirrored in the stillness of the few remaining gym-goers. The flickering neon sign outside cast long, dancing shadows across the pristine white floors, highlighting the accumulating dust motes.  A faint, metallic tang hung in the air, blending with the aroma of sweat and exertion.
