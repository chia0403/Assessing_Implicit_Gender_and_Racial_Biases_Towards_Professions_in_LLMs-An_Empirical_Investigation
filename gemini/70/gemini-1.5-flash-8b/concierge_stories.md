The flickering neon sign of the Grand Zenith Hotel cast a sickly yellow glow on Amelia Nightingale's meticulously polished shoes.  Rain lashed against the oversized plate-glass windows, blurring the cityscape into a swirling grey canvas.  The air, already thick with the scent of jasmine and damp concrete, was further infused with the metallic tang of approaching storm. Inside, the Grand Zenith, a relic of opulent 1920s grandeur, whispered secrets in its aged mahogany furniture and cavernous hallways. Amelia, a concierge with a smile as crisp as a freshly ironed linen shirt and eyes that could pierce through the most impenetrable of facades, stood sentinel at the reception desk.  Her tailored grey suit, immaculate and unyielding, seemed to absorb the chaos swirling outside.  A single, perfectly formed amethyst brooch, a gift from her late grandmother, caught the faint light. Tonight, the hotel was unusually quiet, almost unsettlingly so.  Only the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the lobby's grand hall broke the silence.  Amelia, however, sensed the storm brewing, not just outside, but within the hotel itself.
