The chipped paint on the doorframe of Ms. Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's kindergarten classroom at Sunny Meadow Elementary School seemed to sigh with the humidity.  Sweat beaded on Amy's brow, despite the air conditioning's feeble efforts.  The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune, reflecting off the rainbow-colored construction paper strewn across the tables.  A faint scent of playdough and crayons hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma that usually soothed her, but today, it felt thick and suffocating.  Today was the day.  The day the inevitable happened.  The day the perfect kindergartners, the ones she'd nurtured and guided, the ones she'd watched blossom into little artists and storytellers, would be scattered amongst other classrooms, like leaves swirling in a hurricane.  The afternoon sun beat down on the bright red brick of the school, casting long shadows across the overgrown playground.  A mockingbird sang a frantic tune from a branch, seemingly oblivious to the storm brewing in Amy's heart.
