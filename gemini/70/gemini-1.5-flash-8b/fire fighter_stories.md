The acrid tang of smoke, a familiar, unwelcome guest, clawed at Amelia Blackwood's nostrils.  The relentless hiss of the inferno, a hungry beast devouring the old Victorian, echoed through the narrow alleyway.  Flames, a malevolent orange heart, licked at the eaves, painting the grey brick facade in a terrifying ballet of destruction.  Amelia, a seasoned firefighter with the Oakhaven Volunteer Fire Department, felt the familiar knot tightening in her stomach.  She'd seen this scene played out countless times, yet each time, the raw power of the fire, the desperate cries for help, struck her with the same visceral intensity. This one, however, felt different.  A specific, unnerving chill hung in the air, mixed with the soot and the smell of burning wood. It was the chill of something unseen, something more sinister than just the heat.

**Setting:**

Oakhaven, a quaint, but rapidly developing, small town nestled in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains.  Its Victorian architecture, a testament to its bygone era, now stood cheek-by-jowl with modern developments, creating a striking juxtaposition that seemed to exacerbate the natural tensions of the area. The alleyway where the fire raged was a narrow, shadowed passageway between two blocks of tightly-packed houses.  The air, usually crisp and clean with the scent of pine, was now heavy with the suffocating aroma of burning timber and the metallic tang of metal being consumed by heat.  The rhythmic crackle of the fire was punctuated by the urgent shouts of firefighters and the terrified cries of trapped residents.  Behind the fiery facade, the quiet, shadowed slopes of the Cascade Mountains rose majestically, their peaks veiled in a smoky haze, seemingly untouched by the turmoil below.
