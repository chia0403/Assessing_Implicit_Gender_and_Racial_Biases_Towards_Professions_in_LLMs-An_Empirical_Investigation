The scent of antiseptic and pine needles clung to the air in Dr. Alistair Finch's office, a comforting aroma that often masked the anxieties of his patients.  Sunlight, filtered through the dense leaves of the towering oak outside, painted dappled patterns on the polished hardwood floor.  Alden, a small, meticulously organized space, felt almost too quiet, too still, this Tuesday morning. Dr. Finch, a man whose broad shoulders and quiet intensity often seemed to absorb the stress of the world, sat hunched over a patient chart, the pen poised above a name that caught his eye:  Eleanor Vance.  The name, crisp and formal, felt oddly familiar, a sensation he couldn't quite place.  He traced the name with his finger, the faint scratching sound echoing in the otherwise silent room.  He'd seen a dozen Eleanor Vancess in his career, but this one felt different, resonated with a deeper, more potent undercurrent of something...unresolved.  Eleanor Vance.  The name, tucked within the chart, held a weight that seemed to pull at the quiet serenity of his day.
