The fluorescent lights of the hospital cafeteria hummed, a discordant soundtrack to Dr. Anya Petrova's meticulously organized day.  Anya, a registered dietician with a master's in nutritional sciences, stood at the head of a long, stainless steel table, meticulously arranging pre-portioned meals.  Each container was labelled with a patient's name, a colorful code signifying their dietary restrictions, and a tiny, hand-drawn graphic representing their preferred meal category – a single strawberry for a vegetarian, a stylized meat cleaver for the high-protein diet.  Anya's precise movements, honed by years of practice, were almost robotic.  Today, however, a faint tremor in her hand betrayed the subtle shift in her usual routine.

The setting was the bustling, clinical environment of St. Jude's General Hospital, a sprawling facility in the heart of a rapidly developing city.  Towering skyscrapers pierced the overcast sky, their reflections shimmering on the hospital windows.  The city’s relentless energy seemed to press in on the sterile, yet comforting, atmosphere of the cafeteria, where the aroma of steamed vegetables and subtly spiced broths mingled with the metallic tang of disinfectants.  Anya, dressed in a crisp, navy blue uniform, felt the subtle weight of responsibility pressing down on her.  Her patients, many of whom were fighting battles far greater than the meticulous allocation of calories, demanded her expertise, her dedication, and something more.  Something that the carefully measured grams and milligrams couldn't quantify.
