Rain hammered against the grimy windows of the "Grey Hound" Detective Agency, mimicking the relentless drumming in Amelia "Ash" Ashworth's head.  The office, a cramped space smelling faintly of stale coffee and desperation, was lit by the flickering fluorescent lights, casting long shadows that danced with the rain-streaked grime on the peeling wallpaper.  A chipped porcelain mug sat forgotten on a cluttered desk, its contents long since cold.  Ash, a petite woman with eyes the color of stormy seas and a perpetually tired expression, stared at the crumpled note in her hand.

**Setting:**  The late 1920s.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom of a gritty, industrial district of a rapidly expanding city.  Rain-slicked cobblestones reflected the dim gaslight flickering in the alleys, where shadowy figures moved with the quiet efficiency of predators.  The air, thick with the smell of coal smoke and cheap perfume, hung heavy and oppressive.  The Grey Hound Detective Agency, tucked away on a side street, was a testament to the city's underbelly, a place where whispers traveled faster than the rain.
