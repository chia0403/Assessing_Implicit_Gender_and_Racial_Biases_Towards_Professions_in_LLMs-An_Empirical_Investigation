The chill wind whipped across the cobblestones of Old Market Square, rattling the already-fragile display cases of the antique shops.  Rain, the colour of bruised plums, hammered against the leaded glass of the courthouse, a relentless counterpoint to the rhythmic thump-thump of Justice Judge Elara Nightingale's heart.  It was the eve of the most important trial in her ten years on the Bench â€“ the case of the stolen Star Sapphire.  

Elara, a woman of fifty-two with eyes the colour of stormy seas and hair the shade of raven's wings, stood in the small, dimly lit chamber overlooking the square.  The city, once vibrant with the hubbub of late-afternoon shoppers and street musicians, was now a muted, grey canvas under the approaching twilight.  The oppressive atmosphere clung to her, a palpable weight in the air thick with anticipation and fear.  Tonight, the fate of the esteemed Lord Ashworth, a man whose reputation had been untarnished for generations, rested in her hands. His reputation, and the reputation of the city, hinged on her impartiality.
