The fluorescent lights of "Pixel Pushers," a cramped, graffiti-scarred office space in the heart of Brooklyn, hummed a monotonous tune.  Dust motes danced in the pale light, reflecting off the myriad of colourful swatches, discarded sketches, and half-eaten takeout containers that littered the desks.

Anya stared at the screen, a headache forming behind her eyes.  Her phone buzzed.  A text message from her roommate, Leo:  "Pizza's here.  Come downstairs."  Anya sighed.  Another battle against design chaos, and another impending pizza-induced sugar crash loomed.
