The flickering fluorescent lights of the abandoned radio station hummed a mournful tune, a counterpoint to the distant howl of the wind whistling through the skeletal metal framework of the antenna towers.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the already faded posters of bygone DJs and musical acts.  Inside, amidst the tangle of rusted wiring and broken consoles,  Alistair Finch, radio technician extraordinaire, meticulously adjusted a vintage microphone, its aged brass tarnished with layers of accumulated dust and forgotten stories.  He was a man sculpted by the very rhythms of the airwaves, a creature of the static and the signal.  His thick-rimmed glasses reflected the faint glow of the flickering digital display on the oscilloscope, its screen tracing a chaotic dance of waveforms that told him the silent station was still alive, humming just beneath the surface.
