The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's coat around her legs as she surveyed the sprawling, windswept plains of the Whispering Glade Sanctuary.  Dust devils danced across the tawny grass, mimicking the restless energy of the  hundred-odd animals under her care.  Amelia, a meticulously organized animal caretaker with a heart as vast as the sprawling plains, traced the perimeter of the enclosure with her eyes, her gaze falling on the agitated herd of wild boars, their snuffling and grunting a counterpoint to the howling wind.  This was her sanctuary, a haven she'd painstakingly nurtured for the past five years, a place where creatures injured, abandoned, or simply needing a helping hand found solace.  Tonight, however, the solace seemed fragile, threatened by a storm brewing not just in the sky, but also within the quiet sanctuary itself.  The air crackled with an unspoken tension, a feeling Amelia knew all too well.  The old oak tree, a landmark at the heart of the enclosure, seemed to tremble with the weight of it all.  Tonight, the usual quiet hum of the sanctuary was replaced by an unsettling hush.
