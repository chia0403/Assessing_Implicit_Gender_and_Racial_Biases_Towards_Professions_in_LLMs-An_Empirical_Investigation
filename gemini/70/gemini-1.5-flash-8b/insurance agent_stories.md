Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the "Hopeful Home" insurance office, a building perpetually shrouded in a melancholic mist that clung to the valley like a shroud.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom, illuminating the chipped paint of the walls and the weary expressions of the three employees huddled around a table strewn with paperwork.  Amelia Evangeline Hayes, a woman whose sharp, grey eyes seemed to pierce the gloom, sat hunched over a stack of claims forms, the rhythmic drumming of the rain a dull counterpoint to the frantic scribbling of her pen.  Amelia, at thirty-seven, had the practiced efficiency of a seasoned insurance agent, yet a faint weariness etched itself around her determined jaw. The valley itself felt weary, clinging to the edges of a slow-burning, perpetually threatening drought.  Farmers, the backbone of the region, were losing their livelihoods; crops withered, livestock perished, their hope—and their premiums—shrinking.  Amelia knew the valley was on borrowed time, and she, with the weight of those hopes, was caught in the middle.
