The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s hair across her face as she wrestled a recalcitrant bale of hay.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and pine needles, carried a deeper, mustier aroma – the pungent perfume of the Whispering Pines Wildlife Sanctuary.  Towering Douglas firs, their branches laden with the first dusting of snow, formed a natural cathedral around the sanctuary, their shadows stretching long and skeletal across the uneven, rutted pathways.  Amelia, bundled in layers of wool and waterproofs, squinted at the darkening sky.  Another storm was brewing, promising to blanket the sanctuary in a thick, insulating layer of white, and with it, a night of anxious pacing and vigilant checking on her charges – the orphaned and injured animals she dedicated her life to caring for.  The sanctuary, a ramshackle collection of repurposed barns and lovingly crafted enclosures, was her domain, a chaotic haven of feathered squawks, furry snuffles, and the occasional guttural growl.
