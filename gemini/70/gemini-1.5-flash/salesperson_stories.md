The biting November wind whipped Amelia Katherine “Amy” Hayes’s auburn hair across her face as she wrestled the heavy sample case onto the icy sidewalk.  The air, thick with the scent of woodsmoke and impending snow, hung heavy over the quaint, almost ridiculously picturesque, village of Hollybrooke.
