The acrid bite of smoke, thick and greasy with the scent of burning plastic and something sickeningly sweet, clawed at Lieutenant Elias Thorne's throat.  He coughed, the taste of burnt sugar coating his tongue, and pushed forward, the heavy weight of his gear a familiar burden against the inferno raging within the abandoned warehouse on the docks.  Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless drumming that did little to quell the blaze licking at the sky, painting the night a terrifying orange.  The wind, a spiteful hand, whipped the flames into a frenzy, spitting embers like malevolent sparks across the desolate, rain-slicked concrete.  Elias squinted through the smoke, the flickering orange light reflecting in the sheen of his helmet, his heart a frantic drum against his ribs – a rhythm almost drowned out by the roar of the fire and the crackle of collapsing timbers. This wasn't just another late-night blaze; this felt… different.  The air hummed with a low, unsettling energy, a feeling far beyond the usual adrenaline rush of a dangerous call.
