The chipped porcelain of the apothecary’s mortar felt cool beneath Elias Thorne’s fingertips, a stark contrast to the humid, cloying air hanging heavy in the back room of Thorne’s Pharmacy. Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grime-coated windowpanes, illuminating the chaotic yet meticulously organized shelves packed with jars and bottles.  Each held a story – a cure for a childhood cough, a balm for a broken heart (metaphorically, of course, though Elias suspected some customers believed otherwise), or a potent remedy for a more sinister ailment. The air itself hummed with the faint, sweet scent of dried herbs and the sharp, bracing tang of peppermint, a familiar comfort to Elias, a comfort that was rapidly wearing thin under the weight of the current situation.  Outside, the relentless rhythm of the Charleston rain hammered against the weathered brick facade of the building, a rhythmic counterpoint to the frantic thumping of Elias’s own heart.
