The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face as he wrestled the stubborn oak beam into place.  Below him, the churning grey sea gnawed at the pilings of the half-built lighthouse, a relentless, hungry beast.  The wind, a howling banshee fresh from the north, whipped his already wind-chapped lips raw.  He hammered home the final spike, the sound swallowed instantly by the storm's roar.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and freshly cut timber, carried the faint, almost imperceptible aroma of woodsmoke from the small, isolated village of Port Blossom huddled on the cliff face a hundred yards away.  Elias, his hands calloused and scarred, surveyed his work with a grim satisfaction.  This was no ordinary lighthouse; this was his masterpiece, a testament to his skill built against the unforgiving fury of the Atlantic.
