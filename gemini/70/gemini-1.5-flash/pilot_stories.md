The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful song around Captain Evelyn "Evie" Reed's battered Cessna 185, the icy breath rattling the thin fabric of the plane's wings like skeletal fingers.  Below, the Chugach Mountains clawed at the bruised twilight sky, their jagged peaks dusted with fresh snow, a stark and unforgiving landscape that swallowed the last vestiges of daylight.  The air, thick with the scent of pine and impending snow, hung heavy and cold, clinging to Evie's parka like a shroud.  Her breath plumed white in the frigid air, each exhale a tiny, fleeting testament to her own stubborn presence in this unforgiving wilderness.  She checked her instruments one last time – fuel gauge precariously low, altimeter stubbornly refusing to lie about their altitude – and braced herself for the final, treacherous leg of her flight.  The radio crackled with static, a chilling echo of the isolation that surrounded her.
