The Nevada sun beat down on the hood of Big Rig Bertha, baking the chrome until it shimmered like a mirage.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of ochre and red, danced across the cracked asphalt of Highway 50, the Loneliest Road in America.  Inside the cab, the air conditioning wheezed a pathetic counterpoint to the drone of the engine.  Sweat beaded on the forehead of  Elias "Eli" Stone, his face a roadmap of wrinkles etched by years spent staring at endless horizons and battling the capricious moods of the open road.  He gripped the steering wheel, knuckles white against the worn leather, his eyes, the color of a stormy sea, fixed on the ribbon of highway disappearing into the shimmering heat haze. The radio crackled with static; the only company besides the ghosts of past trips and the rhythmic rumble of the eighteen-wheeler.  This was Eli's domain, his kingdom of endless asphalt and desolate beauty, a place where the only certainty was the next rest stop, and maybe, just maybe, a decent cup of coffee.
