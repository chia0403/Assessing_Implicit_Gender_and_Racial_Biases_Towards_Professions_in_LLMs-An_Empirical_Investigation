The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of sweat and cheap air freshener – a familiar perfume in the dimly lit confines of "Body & Soul Fitness."  Neon tubes flickered overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the mismatched weights and worn yoga mats scattered across the cracked linoleum floor.  Thirty-eight-year-old  Seraphina “Sera”  Montgomery adjusted the microphone clipped to her sweat-soaked tank top, the tiny LED blinking a defiant green in the gloom.  Tonight’s class, "Boot Camp Inferno," was already fifteen minutes late, a common occurrence for the Tuesday night crowd, mostly comprised of stressed-out office workers and perpetually sleep-deprived parents.  But Sera, with her chiseled biceps and a weary but determined glint in her eye, knew the familiar routine: the hesitant shuffling in, the groans of protest, and the eventual, grudging embrace of the burn. Tonight, however, felt different. A prickling unease settled on her skin, a feeling far more profound than the usual pre-class jitters.  The air, even for Body & Soul, felt strangely… still.
