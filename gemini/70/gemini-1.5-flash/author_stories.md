The chipped paint of the writing desk flaked onto Amelia Katherine Blackwood’s manuscript, a tiny, ironic snowfall onto the already blizzard-like chaos of her life.  Rain lashed against the leaded-glass windows of her Victorian cottage, a relentless counterpoint to the frantic tap-tap-tapping of her fingers on the keyboard.  The cottage, nestled precariously on the windswept cliffs overlooking the churning grey sea, was as temperamental as the weather; its ancient timbers groaned under the assault of the elements, mimicking the anxieties churning within Amelia herself.  The deadline for her next historical romance – "The Duke's Unexpected Duchess" – loomed, a monstrous, deadline-shaped kraken threatening to pull her under.  The manuscript, however, remained stubbornly incomplete, a testament to Amelia's current state: a writer's block of epic proportions, fueled by copious amounts of lukewarm tea and a profound lack of inspiration.
