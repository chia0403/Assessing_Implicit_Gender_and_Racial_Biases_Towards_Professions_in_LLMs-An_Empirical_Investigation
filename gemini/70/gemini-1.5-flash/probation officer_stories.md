The chipped paint of the probation office’s waiting room peeled like sunburnt skin, a fitting metaphor for the lives Amelia “Mia” Hernandez navigated daily.  The air hung thick with the cloying scent of stale coffee and simmering resentment, a potent cocktail that clung to the threadbare floral couch where a nervous young man fidgeted with a loose button on his shirt.  Outside, the relentless Los Angeles sun beat down on the cracked asphalt of the parking lot, baking the already oppressive heat of a late July afternoon.  Mia, her own frustration simmering just beneath the surface of her professional composure, tapped a pen against the worn laminate of her desk, the rhythmic click a counterpoint to the muffled sobs emanating from a nearby cubicle.  Another violated curfew, another shattered promise. Another day in the life of a probation officer in the heart of the San Fernando Valley.
