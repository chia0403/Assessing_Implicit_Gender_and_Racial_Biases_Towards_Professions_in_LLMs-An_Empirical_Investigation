The chill wind, sharp as a cleaver, whipped at Archibald "Archie" Bartholomew's apron as he wrestled the recalcitrant side of beef onto the stainless steel hook.  Steam, thick and fragrant with the scent of rosemary and thyme, rose from the recently-drained carcass, clinging to the icy air of Bartholomew's Butchers, a shop so old its timbers groaned under the weight of centuries.  Outside, the cobblestones of Grimsborough's High Street were slick with a fresh snowfall, the muted light of a late November afternoon casting long shadows that danced with the flickering gas lamps.  Inside, the shop was a warm, comforting island of blood-red tile, mahogany counters polished to a gleam, and the rhythmic *thunk-thunk-thunk* of Archie's cleaver against the chopping block â€“ a comforting symphony in the encroaching darkness.  The air, despite the cold seeping in through the gaps in the window frames, buzzed with a low hum of anticipation.  Tonight was the annual Grimsborough Goose Gala, and Archie's prize-winning birds were ready, plump and golden-brown, awaiting their moment of glory.
