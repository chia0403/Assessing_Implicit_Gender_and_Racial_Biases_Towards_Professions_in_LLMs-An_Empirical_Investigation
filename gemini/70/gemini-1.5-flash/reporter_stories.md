The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s auburn hair across her face as she hunched deeper into her threadbare coat.  Rain, a relentless, icy drizzle, plastered her trench coat to her back, clinging to the worn leather like a second skin.  She stood on the rain-slicked cobblestones of Bleaker’s Wharf, the salty air thick with the smell of brine and decaying fish.

Tonight, however, the picturesque felt distinctly menacing. Amelia shivered, not entirely from the cold.  A crumpled, anonymous note clutched in her gloved hand promised a story, a story that smelled far more sinister than the rotting fish.
