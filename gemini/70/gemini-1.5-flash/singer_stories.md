The stale air of the dressing room hung thick with the scent of cheap cologne and desperation.  Dust motes, illuminated by a single bare bulb swinging precariously from the ceiling, danced in the weak light.  Seraphina "Sera" Nightingale, her voice already hoarse from a three-hour gig in a smoky dive bar called The Rusty Mug, sat hunched over a chipped porcelain sink, dabbing at her mascara-streaked cheeks with a crumpled paper towel.
