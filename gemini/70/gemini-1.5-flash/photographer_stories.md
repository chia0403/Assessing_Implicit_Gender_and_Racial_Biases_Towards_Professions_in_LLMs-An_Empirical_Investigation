The biting wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne's hair across her face, stinging her cheeks a vibrant crimson that clashed wildly with the stark, monochrome landscape before her.  Ice, the colour of a bruised plum, clung to the jagged peaks of the Mourne Mountains, their silhouettes etched against a sky the shade of pewter.  Amelia, bundled in layers of wool and fleece that did little to combat the chill, adjusted the strap of her battered leather camera bag.  The air hung heavy with the scent of pine and damp earth, a fragrance both bracing and desolate.  She hadn't been to County Down in years, not since the incident â€“ the one she tried so hard to banish from her memory, but which continued to haunt her like the persistent grey clouds that clung to these unforgiving hills.  Today, however, she wasn't here to run from her past; she was here to capture its essence, to immortalize the raw, untamed beauty of the Mournes, hoping to find a fragile peace within their icy embrace.
