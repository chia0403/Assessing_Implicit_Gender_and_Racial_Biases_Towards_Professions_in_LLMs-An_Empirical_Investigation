The stale scent of antiseptic and burnt coffee hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Dr. Evelyn Reed.  Rain lashed against the frosted glass windows of her practice, "Reed Family Dentistry," blurring the already hazy view of the snow-dusted Main Street of Havenwood, Vermont.  Inside, the only sound besides the rhythmic drumming of the storm was the low hum of the sterilization unit, a mechanical heartbeat in the otherwise quiet office.  Evelyn, her dark hair pulled back in a practical braid, meticulously polished a pair of forceps, the silver glinting under the harsh fluorescent lights.  The last patient had left an hour ago, leaving behind a lingering silence that was almost as unnerving as the cacophony of a busy surgery day.  Tonight, however, the unnerving silence was punctuated by a persistent, rhythmic tappingâ€¦ a tapping that wasn't coming from the storm.
