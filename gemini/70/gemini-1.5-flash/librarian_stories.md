The scent of aged paper and leather, a perfume both comforting and subtly melancholic, clung to Eleanor Vance like a second skin.  Dust motes, illuminated by the afternoon sun slanting through the arched windows of the Blackwood Memorial Library, danced in the stillness.  Outside, the November wind howled a mournful ballad against the ancient stone façade, a counterpoint to the quiet tap-tap-tap of Eleanor’s fingers on the keyboard.  She sat nestled in her usual corner, surrounded by towering shelves packed with the silent chronicles of countless lives, a worn cardigan draped over her shoulders like a protective cloak against the encroaching chill, both literal and metaphorical.  This wasn't just any library; Blackwood Memorial was a labyrinthine repository of forgotten lore, whispered secrets, and the occasional, unsettling truth.  And tonight, Eleanor felt a truth – a chilling one –  was about to be unearthed.
