The biting Antarctic wind howled a mournful song around Dr. Evelyn Grace Moreau, stinging her exposed cheeks despite the heavy thermal layers.  The air, thin and frigid, tasted of ozone and the faint, metallic tang of sea ice.  Evelyn hunched deeper into her parka, the collar scratching against her already chapped skin.  Before her, stretching as far as the eye could see under a sky the color of bruised plums, lay the vast, unforgiving expanse of the Ross Ice Shelf.  Its surface, a seemingly endless field of fractured ice, groaned and shifted under the relentless pressure of the glacier behind it, a sound that resonated deep within Evelyn’s chest, a symphony of glacial power and impending… something.  This wasn't just a research expedition; it was a desperate race against a rapidly melting future.
