The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Aurelia "Rella" Montenegro.  Rain lashed against the stained-glass windows of her salon, "Shear Madness," blurring the already hazy gaslight glow of the cobbled street outside.  Rella, perched on a worn velvet stool, meticulously cleaned her shears, the rhythmic click a counterpoint to the relentless drumming of the storm.  Shear Madness wasn't exactly located in the most affluent part of Prague, nestled as it was between a bustling butcher shop and a dimly lit tavern, but it was home.  And tonight,  home felt particularly damp, both literally and metaphorically, as a chilling premonition settled over Rella like the approaching autumn night.
