The scent of beeswax and lavender hung heavy in the air, a comforting shroud against the biting November wind that rattled the single pane windows of Elias Thorne's tailor shop.  Elias, his fingers nimble and precise as he guided a needle through fine silk, barely registered the gusts.  His world was contained within the four walls of "Thorne's Threads," a modest establishment tucked away on a cobbled side street in the ancient port city of Porthaven.  Outside, the cries of gulls battling the wind and the rumble of carts on the nearby quayside were a constant, almost musical, backdrop to the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of his shears.  The shop itself, a cramped but charming space filled with bolts of vibrant cloth stacked to the ceiling and the soft glow of a single oil lamp, was a testament to Elias's dedication â€“ a sanctuary woven from threads of patience, skill, and a lifetime spent amongst the whispering silks and sturdy wools.
