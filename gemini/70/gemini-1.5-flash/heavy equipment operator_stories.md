The rasp of metal on metal, a sound like tortured fingernails on a chalkboard, was the soundtrack to Amelia “Amy” Blackwood’s morning.  Dawn, a bruised purple smudge on the eastern horizon, barely touched the inky blackness clinging to the sprawling construction site.  Amy, perched high in the cab of her Caterpillar D9T bulldozer, felt the familiar vibration hum through her bones, a comforting tremor against the pre-dawn chill.  The air, thick with the scent of diesel and damp earth, carried the faint whisper of approaching rain.  This wasn't just any construction site; it was the heart of the new Redwood Ridge development, a sprawling project carving a luxury housing estate out of the rugged, unforgiving terrain of the Oregon Coast Range.  Around her, the skeletal frames of future mansions poked from the raw earth like bleached bones, a testament to the relentless march of progress.  Amy, however, felt a kinship with the earth itself, a connection forged through years spent wrestling with its stubborn resistance and its unpredictable moods.  Today, that mood seemed particularly sullen.
