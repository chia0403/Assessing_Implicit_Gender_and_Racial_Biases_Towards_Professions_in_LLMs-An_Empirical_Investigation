The sterile scent of antiseptic and the low hum of the suction machine were the soundtrack to Seraphina "Sera" Moreau's life.  It wasn't a bad life, not really.  Sera loved her job as a dental hygienist at Aspen Dental, nestled on the sun-drenched, slightly-too-touristy Main Street of Sedona, Arizona.  The red rocks, breathtaking even after five years, formed a dramatic backdrop to the otherwise mundane routine of scaling and polishing.  But today, the usual calming rhythm of the office was disrupted. A nervous energy crackled in the air, thicker than the desert dust swirling outside the panoramic window, a dust storm brewing not just outside, but within the walls of Aspen Dental.  This was because Mr. Fitzwilliam, Sedona's most eccentric recluse and owner of the town's only crystal mine, had arrived for his twice-yearly cleaning, and he wasn't alone.
