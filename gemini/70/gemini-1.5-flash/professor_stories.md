Professor Augustine Blackwood adjusted his spectacles, the thin wire frames pinching the bridge of his nose.  Rain lashed against the leaded glass windows of his study, a relentless drumming that mirrored the erratic beat of his own heart. The air hung thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, a perfume only truly appreciated by those who spent their days wrestling with the mysteries hidden within the ancient tomes lining the walls of his rambling, ivy-covered cottage.  This wasn't just any cottage; it clung precariously to the windswept cliffs of Cornwall, overlooking a churning, grey Atlantic that seemed to whisper forgotten secrets to the jagged rocks below.  Tonight, those whispers felt particularly insistent.  The flickering candlelight cast long, dancing shadows across the worn oak desk, illuminating a single, open book whose pages contained a cryptic manuscript that threatened to unravel everything Augustine thought he knew.
