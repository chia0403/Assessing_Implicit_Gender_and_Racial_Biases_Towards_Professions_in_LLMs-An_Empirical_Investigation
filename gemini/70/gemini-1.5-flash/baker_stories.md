The aroma of cardamom and roasting almonds hung heavy in the pre-dawn air, a fragrant shroud clinging to the cobbled streets of  Port Blossom.  Rain, the kind that whispers secrets on the wind, slicked the windowpanes of "The Crumb & Kettle," blurring the already hazy gaslights into shimmering pools of orange.  Inside, amidst the gentle hiss of the oven and the rhythmic thump of Amelia Hawthorne's kneading hands, a quiet intensity reigned.  Amelia, flour dusting her eyelashes like a delicate snowfall, worked with a practiced grace, her brow furrowed in concentration as she coaxed life into a batch of sourdough, its yeasty breath promising a day filled with the comforting warmth only freshly baked bread can provide.  The bakery, a cozy haven tucked away on a quiet side street, was her sanctuary, a place where the worries of the world seemed to melt away under the comforting heat of the ovens.
