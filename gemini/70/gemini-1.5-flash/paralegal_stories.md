The flickering neon sign of the "Golden Gavel" bar cast a lurid green glow across Amelia Grace Hawthorne's rain-slicked trench coat.  Rain hammered against the grimy windows of the cramped, dimly lit alleyway where she stood, the smell of stale beer and something vaguely chemical clinging to the air like a second skin.  Amelia, a paralegal with a reputation for digging up dirt others wouldn't dare touch, hunched deeper into her coat, the collar scratching against her cheek.  The crumpled takeout container of lukewarm pho in her hand offered little comfort against the chill that seeped from the alley's shadowed corners and, more unsettlingly, from the uneasy feeling that had settled in her gut. Tonight's meeting felt different.  This wasn't just another late-night rendezvous with a disgruntled client; this felt like the beginning of somethingâ€¦ far more dangerous.
