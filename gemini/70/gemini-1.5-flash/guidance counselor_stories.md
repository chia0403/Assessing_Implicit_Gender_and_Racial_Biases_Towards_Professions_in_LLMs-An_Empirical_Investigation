The chipped paint of Ms. Eleanor Vance’s office door seemed to mirror the cracks in the carefully constructed facade of Northwood High.  Rain lashed against the windows, a relentless drumming that echoed the turmoil brewing inside her.  The scent of stale coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume in the cramped, cluttered space that served as her sanctuary – and battlefield.  Eleanor Vance,  Guidance Counselor extraordinaire (or so the school’s overly optimistic brochure claimed), sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear.  The afternoon was young, but already three students had stormed through her doorway, each carrying a weight far exceeding their seventeen years.  A crumpled application for early college admission lay forgotten on her desk, overshadowed by a stack of tear-stained progress reports and a half-eaten granola bar that had seen better days.  Outside, the storm raged on, mirroring the perfect storm of teenage angst brewing within Northwood High’s walls.
