The chipped turquoise paint on the windowsill matched the chipped turquoise polish clinging stubbornly to Isabella “Izzy” Rodriguez’s cuticles.  Izzy sighed, the sound swallowed by the rhythmic whir of the nail drill echoing in the hushed, lavender-scented quiet of “Izzy’s Nails,” her tiny salon tucked away on a cobbled side street in the heart of Prague’s Old Town.  Outside, the Vltava River gurgled a gentle counterpoint to the city’s low hum, a symphony of distant church bells and the chattering of tourists haggling over trinkets.  The scent of roasted sausages and warm trdelník drifted in through the open window, mingling with the surprisingly potent aroma of Izzy’s signature lavender-and-bergamot cuticle oil.  The air hung thick with the promise of a warm, late-summer afternoon, a stark contrast to the icy chill that had settled in Izzy’s heart.  It had been three months since…well, since everything changed.
