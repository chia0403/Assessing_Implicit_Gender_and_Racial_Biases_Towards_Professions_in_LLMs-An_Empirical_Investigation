The recycled air hung thick and faintly metallic, a familiar scent to Amelia Katherine Hayes.  Amelia, or Amy as most passengers called her, traced the condensation forming on her water bottle with a manicured fingernail, the rhythmic thrum of the Boeing 747-8 a low, comforting vibration beneath her feet.  Outside, the inky blackness of the Atlantic stretched endlessly, punctuated only by the occasional flash of lightning far below.  The cabin lights were dimmed, a soft, amber glow casting long shadows across the sleeping passengers – a tapestry of snoring snores, gentle breaths, and the occasional muffled cough.  Amy, perched in the jump seat near the galley, was the silent guardian of this airborne city, a watchful eye in the near-dark, ready for anything the next leg of this overnight flight from London to San Francisco might throw her way. The scent of lukewarm coffee and something vaguely floral – a passenger's perfume, perhaps – mingled with the ever-present aroma of jet fuel, a comforting, if somewhat bizarre, cocktail. This was her life, her haven, her slightly chaotic and often unpredictable kingdom in the clouds.
