The biting November wind whipped across the desolate stretch of Interstate 40, stinging Elias Thorne's cheeks raw.  He hunched deeper into his worn orange jacket, the thin fabric offering little protection against the relentless assault.

The only sounds were the rhythmic thrum of his jackhammer, the occasional screech of tires far in the distance, and the mournful cry of a hawk circling high above. Elias, a veteran highway worker for the Department of Transportation, squinted against the dust kicked up by his own machine.  Another pothole. Another day battling the relentless erosion of the desert and the apathy of careless drivers.
