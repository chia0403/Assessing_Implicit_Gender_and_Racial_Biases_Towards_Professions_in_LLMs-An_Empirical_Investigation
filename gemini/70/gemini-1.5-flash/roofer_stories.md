The biting November wind whipped Elias Thorne’s thick, salt-and-pepper beard across his face as he perched precariously on the gabled roof of Mrs. Periwinkle’s Victorian monstrosity.  Below, the town of Ashwood sprawled like a watercolour painting gone slightly awry – a chaotic jumble of crooked streets, mismatched houses, and the perpetually overcast sky mirroring the general mood of its inhabitants.  Rain, a familiar companion in Ashwood, threatened to unleash itself in earnest, the clouds heavy and pregnant with the promise of a deluge.  The air smelled of damp earth and woodsmoke, a scent Elias, a roofer for nearly forty years, had come to associate with the inevitable end of autumn and the creeping chill of winter.  His worn leather work gloves, stiff with age and grime, gripped the damp shingles, each movement measured and deliberate.  This wasn't just a job; it was a dance with gravity, a conversation with the elements, a testament to years spent defying the pull of the earth.
