The rusty swing sign creaked a mournful tune in the humid Charleston air, its faded lettering barely proclaiming "Bartholomew "Barty" Blackwood, Barber."  Barty himself, a man whose face bore the same weathered patina as the shop's cypress siding, sat perched on a worn leather stool, the rhythmic snip-snip of his shears a counterpoint to the cicadas' relentless drone.  His shop, nestled on a quiet side street just off Meeting Street, was a time capsule;  the walls were lined with chipped porcelain shaving mugs, yellowed photographs of long-dead Charleston gentlemen, and framed newspaper clippings chronicling the city's colourful history.  The air hung thick with the scent of bay rum, talcum powder, and something else, something indefinably old and mysterious, like the secrets whispered amongst the moss-draped oaks that shaded the street outside.  This was not just a barbershop; it was a repository of Charleston's past, and Barty Blackwood, its quiet, observant custodian.
