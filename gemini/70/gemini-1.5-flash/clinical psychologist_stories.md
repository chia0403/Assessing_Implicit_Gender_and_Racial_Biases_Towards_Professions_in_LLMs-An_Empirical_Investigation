The air hung heavy with the scent of old books and something else, something faintly floral yet undeniably melancholic – the lingering perfume of a patient's anxiety, perhaps, clinging to the very fabric of the room.  Eleanor, her name a stark contrast to the comforting chaos of her surroundings, sat at her mahogany desk, the weight of a particularly challenging case pressing down on her like a physical burden.  The file – thick with notes, scribbled observations, and fragmented memories – lay open before her, a testament to the labyrinthine depths of the human psyche she navigated daily.  Outside, the city roared, a cacophony of sirens and distant shouts a stark counterpoint to the hushed stillness within her office.  Today, however, the silence felt heavier than usual, pregnant with the unspoken fears of the next appointment already knocking, impatient and unseen, at her door.
