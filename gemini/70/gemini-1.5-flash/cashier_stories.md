The fluorescent lights of "Quick Stop" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Elara Vance's Tuesday evening.  The air hung thick with the cloying sweetness of stale donuts and the faint, metallic tang of spilled soda.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the already indistinct neon signs of the neighboring businesses into hazy streaks of color.  Elara, her name stitched in faded blue thread onto her worn apron, rested her chin on her hand, the rhythmic *beep* of the scanner the only sound louder than the drumming rain.  Outside, the city of Veridia sprawled, a chaotic tapestry of glittering skyscrapers and rain-slicked streets, a world Elara observed from her tiny, brightly-lit island of monotony.  Tonight, however, the usual humdrum routine promised to be anything but. A nervous energy crackled in the air, as thick and heavy as the humid summer night itself.
