The salt spray stung Chef Emilia "Mia" Bellissimo's face as she wrestled with the recalcitrant fishing net.  The wind, a raw, relentless Atlantic gale, howled a mournful tune around the craggy cliffs of Inis Mór, the largest of the Aran Islands.  Below her, the churning grey water threatened to swallow the small currach bobbing precariously in the turbulent waves.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and seaweed, carried a faint, almost imperceptible undercurrent of woodsmoke and peat – the comforting aroma of home, a stark contrast to the chaos of the storm. Mia, her usually vibrant auburn hair plastered to her cheeks, gripped the net tighter, her knuckles white against the coarse rope.  This wasn't how she'd envisioned spending her day off; a meticulously planned trip to source the freshest seafood for her restaurant, "An Cladaigh," had turned into a desperate fight against the elements.  But then, life on Inis Mór rarely went according to plan.
