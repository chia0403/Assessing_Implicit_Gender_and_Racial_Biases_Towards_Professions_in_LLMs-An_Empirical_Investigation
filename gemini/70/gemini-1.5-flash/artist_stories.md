The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face as he wrestled the easel into a more stable position against the relentless wind.  Above him, the cliffs of Cornwall clawed at the bruised, twilight sky, their granite teeth bared against a sea the colour of a storm-wracked bruise.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and seaweed, carried the mournful cry of gulls, a counterpoint to the frantic rhythm of his brushstrokes.  Elias, a man whose beard mirrored the wildness of the landscape, was attempting to capture the ephemeral beauty of the dying light on the churning ocean, a task that felt as monumental and unforgiving as the cliffs themselves.  His canvas, already a chaotic swirl of blues and greys, was a testament to both his struggle and the untamed power of the Atlantic.
