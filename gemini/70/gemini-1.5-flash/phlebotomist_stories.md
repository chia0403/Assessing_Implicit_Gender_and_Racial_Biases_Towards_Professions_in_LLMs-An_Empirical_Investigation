The fluorescent lights of the Mercy General Hospital phlebotomy lab hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* of Amelia Katherine “Amy” Hayes’s own heartbeat.  It wasn’t the needles that made her pulse quicken – after ten years, the sight of a vein was as commonplace as a sunrise – but the unusually hushed atmosphere.  A thick fog of antiseptic and nervous energy hung heavy in the air, clinging to the starched white coats and the stainless steel countertops, usually vibrant with the chaotic energy of a busy morning. This morning, however, felt different.  A silence, heavy with unspoken dread, had settled over the usually bustling lab, broken only by the occasional, barely audible whimper from a nearby curtained cubicle. Amy, tightening her already-taut ponytail, felt a prickle of unease crawl up her spine.  Something was wrong, profoundly wrong, and she had a bad feeling it wasn’t just a particularly difficult stick.
