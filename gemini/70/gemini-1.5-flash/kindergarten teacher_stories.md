The chipped paint of the ladybug-decorated wall seemed to sigh in the humid July air, mirroring the weary slump in Ms. Eleanor Vance’s shoulders.  Sunlight, thick and honey-colored, slanted through the tall windows of Room 2B at Sunny Meadows Elementary, illuminating swirling motes of dust that danced like mischievous sprites.
