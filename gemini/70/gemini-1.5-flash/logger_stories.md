The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of pine and damp earth, a smell Elias Thorne, Jr. knew as intimately as the lines on his own calloused hands.  Dawn painted the eastern sky in bruised purples and angry oranges, a fitting backdrop for the brooding silhouette of Mount Cragmore, its jagged peak clawing at the bruised sky.  Below, nestled in a valley so deep it seemed to swallow the sunlight, lay the logging camp of Blackwood Gulch â€“ a collection of ramshackle cabins and rusting machinery clinging precariously to the mountainside, a testament to the relentless industry that had carved its existence from the ancient forest.  Elias, his beard dusted with sawdust and his flannel shirt stained with the rich brown of redwood sap, hefted his axe, the familiar weight a comforting presence in the silent pre-dawn.  The day's work awaited, a dance of steel and wood against the unforgiving backdrop of the wilderness.
