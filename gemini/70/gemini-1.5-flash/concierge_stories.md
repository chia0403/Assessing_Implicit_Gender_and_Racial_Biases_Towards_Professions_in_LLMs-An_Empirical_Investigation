The rain hammered against the vast, obsidian windows of the Zenith Hotel, each drop a tiny, furious fist against the city’s glittering skyline.

Low, plush seating hugged the walls of the lobby, and the scent of expensive potpourri – a carefully curated blend of sandalwood and something subtly floral – hung in the air.  This was the domain of  Aurelia Genevieve Dubois, Concierge and undisputed queen of the Zenith’s meticulously polished, flawlessly efficient world.  Tonight, however, the usual calm was shattered; a low hum of anxious energy vibrated beneath the surface, a tremor felt even by Aurelia, who had dealt with runaway brides, rogue art collectors, and even the occasional escaped llama with an unnerving degree of composure.  Tonight, something felt…different.
