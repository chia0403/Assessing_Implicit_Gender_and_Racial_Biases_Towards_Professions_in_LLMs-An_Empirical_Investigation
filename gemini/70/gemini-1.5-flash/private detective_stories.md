The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Isabella “Izzy” Diaz’s office, a rhythm that mirrored the frantic beat of her own heart.  The air hung thick with the smell of cheap coffee and something vaguely floral, probably the attempt at air freshener battling the pervasive scent of stale cigarettes and desperation that clung to the peeling paint of her cramped Chinatown office.  Outside, neon signs bled lurid colours across the slick, rain-streaked streets, casting long, distorted shadows that danced and writhed like restless spirits.  Izzy, perched on the edge of her worn leather chair, steepled her fingers, the chipped nail polish a testament to a week of barely-sleeping, caffeine-fueled investigations.  The crumpled file in her hand – a photograph of a young woman with wide, frightened eyes – felt heavy, heavier than the guilt that gnawed at her conscience. This case, the disappearance of Clara Moreau, was different. It felt…personal.
