The biting wind whipped Amelia Katherine Finch’s charcoal-grey shawl tighter around her shoulders, the icy spray from the churning Atlantic stinging her cheeks.  She pulled her worn leather gloves further up her wrists, her fingers already numb despite the thick wool lining.  The sky above the cliffs of Cornwall was a bruised purple, the setting sun a smoldering ember sinking into the tumultuous ocean.  Below, the jagged rocks, slick with sea-foam and shadow, clawed at the retreating tide.  Amelia, perched precariously on a wind-battered outcrop, barely noticed the treacherous drop.  Her gaze was fixed on the scene before her, a maelstrom of colour and chaos that screamed to be captured on canvas, a tempestuous masterpiece yearning for birth.  The smell of brine and seaweed hung heavy in the air, a pungent perfume that mingled with the earthy scent of the cliff face and the sharp tang of the salt spray.  This wild, untamed beauty was Amelia’s muse, her constant companion, and the source of her artistic soul.
