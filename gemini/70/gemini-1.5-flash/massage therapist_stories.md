The scent of lavender and sandalwood hung heavy in the air, a deliberate counterpoint to the damp, salty tang that clung to Elias Thorne's skin.  He’d just finished his last client of the day, a burly fisherman with hands like knotted oak and a back as creaky as an old ship’s mast.  Elias, a certified massage therapist with ten years of experience and a touch as light as a feather, or as firm as a blacksmith’s hammer, depending on the need, peeled off his worn cotton gloves. The rhythmic crash of waves against the jagged rocks of the Cornish coastline provided a soothing, if slightly melancholic, soundtrack to his evening ritual.  His small, seaside practice, "The Tidewater Touch," nestled between a fishmonger and a surprisingly popular knitwear shop, was bathed in the fading amber light of a late autumn sunset.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune, promising a stormy night.  Inside, however, Elias hoped to find a different kind of calm.
