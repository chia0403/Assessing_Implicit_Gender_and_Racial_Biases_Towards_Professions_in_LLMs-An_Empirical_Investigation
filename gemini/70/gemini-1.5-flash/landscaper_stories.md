The relentless Texas sun beat down on Elias Thorne’s neck, turning the sweat on his brow into tiny, glittering rivers.  He wiped it away with the back of his calloused hand, the scent of sun-baked earth and freshly cut grass clinging to his skin.  Dust motes danced in the shimmering heat haze rising from the parched earth of the sprawling Austin estate, a landscape of manicured lawns, towering oaks, and meticulously arranged flowerbeds stretching out before him like a verdant, expensive tapestry.  Elias, owner of Thorne Landscaping, adjusted the brim of his weathered straw hat, his gaze sweeping over the property with a practiced eye.  He'd seen worse, of course – neglected estates overrun with weeds, drought-stricken lawns turning brown as old parchment – but this was a challenge nonetheless. This was the Blackwood estate, infamous for its demanding owner and even more demanding expectations.  And Elias Thorne, despite the oppressive heat and the daunting task ahead, was ready to conquer it.
