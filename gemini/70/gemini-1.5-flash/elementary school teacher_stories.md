The chipped paint of Mrs. Eleanor Vance’s classroom desk felt rough beneath her fingertips, a familiar texture mirroring the grit she felt settling in her stomach.  October’s relentless rain hammered against the single, grimy windowpane of Room 2B at Oakhaven Elementary, blurring the already faded mural of cheerful, cartoonish animals frolicking in a field of impossibly vibrant sunflowers.  The air hung thick with the scent of damp wool coats and the faint, almost imperceptible tang of impending doom.  It wasn't the usual pre-parent-teacher-conference anxiety; this felt different, heavier, like a storm brewing not just outside, but within the very walls of the ancient, drafty school building itself.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the windows in their frames like skeletal fingers tapping a frantic rhythm.  Inside, Eleanor Vance, a woman whose smile usually held the warmth of a summer afternoon, felt a chill seep into her bones far colder than any October rain could ever muster.
