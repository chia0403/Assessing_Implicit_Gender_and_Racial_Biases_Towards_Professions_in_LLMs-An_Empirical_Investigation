The relentless Mumbai monsoon hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Dr. Anya Sharma’s tiny consulting room, a rhythmic drumming that mirrored the frantic beat of her own heart.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the already hazy cityscape into a watercolour smear of greys and muted greens.  The air, thick with the scent of petrichor and exhaust fumes, hung heavy and humid.  Inside, however, a stark contrast reigned:  Anya’s room was meticulously organised, a calming oasis of pale wood and calming greens amidst the chaos outside.  The aroma of freshly brewed ginger tea, a comforting counterpoint to the storm’s fury, filled the air, a testament to Anya's belief in the power of simple, natural remedies.  She sat at her desk, the glow of her laptop illuminating her concerned face, a half-eaten plate of  perfectly portioned quinoa salad forgotten beside a mountain of patient files.  This monsoon season wasn’t just bringing the rain; it was bringing a crisis.
