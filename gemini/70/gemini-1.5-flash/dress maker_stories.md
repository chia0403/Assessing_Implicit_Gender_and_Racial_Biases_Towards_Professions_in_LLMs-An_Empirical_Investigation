The scent of lavender and old silk hung heavy in the air, a comforting shroud against the relentless November drizzle lashing against the leaded windows of Willow Creek Atelier.  Rainwater streaked the panes, blurring the already indistinct view of the cobbled street beyond. Inside, however, a warm, amber glow emanated from the gas lamps illuminating rows upon rows of fabric bolts â€“ silks the color of sunset, velvets deep as midnight, and linens as crisp as winter air.  Amidst this textile tapestry, hunched over a meticulously crafted bodice, sat Aurelia Genevieve Hawthorne, her nimble fingers coaxing life into a shimmering gown of emerald green.  Her brow was furrowed in concentration, a stray strand of auburn hair escaping the elegant chignon at the nape of her neck.  Outside, the world was a sodden grey; inside Aurelia's atelier, it was a vibrant, shimmering dream woven from thread and ambition.
