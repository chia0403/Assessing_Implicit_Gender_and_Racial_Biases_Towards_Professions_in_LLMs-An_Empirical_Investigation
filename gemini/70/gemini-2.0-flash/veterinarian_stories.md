Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a veterinarian named Eleanor "Ellie" Hawthorne:

**Setting:** The windswept, rugged coastline of County Donegal, Ireland. Specifically, a small, ramshackle veterinary clinic situated on the edge of the village of Glencolmcille, overlooking the Atlantic Ocean. The clinic, "Anam Cara Veterinary," is a converted stone cottage, its walls plastered with fading posters of various animals and its windows often rattled by the fierce Irish gales.

**Opening:**

The salt spray stung Eleanor "Ellie" Hawthorne's face as she wrestled with the recalcitrant gate leading to the tiny paddock behind Anam Cara Veterinary. The wind, a howling banshee fresh off the Atlantic, whipped her auburn hair around her face, making it nearly impossible to see. She muttered a Gaelic curse under her breath, a habit picked up from the locals since moving back home, and finally managed to secure the gate with a rusted hook.

Inside, a small Connemara pony named Finn, his shaggy coat plastered to his bony frame by the incessant rain, stamped his hooves impatiently. He was a rescue case, abandoned near Slieve League, and Ellie had been nursing him back to health for the past few weeks. His bright, intelligent eyes, though, held a spark of the wild spirit that refused to be extinguished by neglect.

Ellie sighed, pulling her worn Barbour jacket tighter. "Alright, Finn, easy now," she said, her voice barely audible over the roar of the wind. "Let's see about that cough of yours. Then it's back inside for both of us, where it's warm and dry...or at least less damp."

The truth was, "warm and dry" were relative terms at Anam Cara. The old cottage leaked like a sieve, and the peat fire in the waiting room struggled to keep the damp chill at bay. But it was home, or at least, it was becoming home again after all these years away. And Finn, along with the odd assortment of sheep, dogs, cats, and even the occasional wayward seal that found their way to her doorstep, was the reason she stayed. County Donegal needed a vet, and Eleanor Hawthorne, after a brief and ultimately unsatisfying stint at a fancy equine clinic in Newmarket, needed Donegal.
