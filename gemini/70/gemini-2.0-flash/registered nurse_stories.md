**Story Opening:**

The smell of bleach and simmering fear was Martha Eleanor Ainsworth's morning coffee. She took a deep breath, trying to center herself before stepping onto the ward, but the cloying aroma clung to her like a persistent cough. Just beyond the double doors, the fluorescent hum of the ICU buzzed, a discordant counterpoint to the rhythmic beeping of machines clinging desperately to fragile lives. Another COVID surge. Another day fighting a battle that felt increasingly unwinnable. Martha adjusted her N95 mask, the elastic biting into the bridge of her nose. She was tired, bone-deep tired, but the faces of her patients swam before her eyes: Mrs. Olsen, gasping for breath; Mr. Ramirez, his eyes filled with terror; and young Sarah, barely older than her own daughter, trapped in a silent, sterile world. Martha straightened her shoulders. Today, she would fight. Today, she would hold their hands, offer a kind word, and do everything in her power to bring them back. Even if it felt like she was facing the storm alone.

**Setting:**

The story is set in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of St. Jude's Hospital in Portland, Oregon, during a particularly brutal wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The hospital, usually a place of healing, feels more like a warzone. The air is thick with tension, the corridors are choked with the beeping and whirring of medical equipment, and exhausted medical personnel move with a weary urgency. The walls are adorned with hastily drawn thank-you notes from the community, but the sentiment feels dwarfed by the sheer scale of the suffering. Outside, the city of Portland is shrouded in a perpetual drizzle, mirroring the gloom that has settled over St. Jude's. The time is late Autumn, the days growing shorter and colder, mirroring the fading hope within the walls of the ICU.
