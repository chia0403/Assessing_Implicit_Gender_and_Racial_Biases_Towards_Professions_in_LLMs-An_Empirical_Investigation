## Story Opening:

The steel bit into the morning air with a shriek that vibrated in Michael Anthony Rossiâ€™s bones. He braced his weight against the unforgiving metal beam, his calloused hands tightening their grip. Sweat already beaded on his forehead, the chill wind from the Hudson doing little to alleviate the physical toll of the job. Down below, New York City was stirring, a concrete and glass leviathan waking from its slumber. But up here, on the skeletal frame of the new Hudson Yards skyscraper, Michael was king of his little, precarious kingdom. He spat a wad of chewing tobacco into the churning void, the brownish streak disappearing into the gray haze. He hated mornings. He especially hated mornings that involved hanging hundreds of feet above the ground, wrestling I-beams like angry serpents. But rent was due, and Stella needed new shoes.

## Setting:

The setting is the construction site of a high-rise skyscraper in the Hudson Yards area of New York City. The building is currently in its steel frame phase, meaning the structural skeleton is being erected but the exterior cladding and interior work have not yet begun. It's early morning, around 6:30 AM, and the air is cool and crisp, with a slight breeze blowing off the Hudson River. The panoramic view of the city is breathtaking, showcasing iconic landmarks like the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building, but the immediate environment is noisy and hazardous, filled with the clang of steel, the roar of machinery, and the shouted commands of the construction crew. The site is a symphony of organized chaos, a testament to the relentless ambition that fuels the city's growth. Safety nets are strategically placed, but the ever-present threat of a fall hangs heavy in the air.
