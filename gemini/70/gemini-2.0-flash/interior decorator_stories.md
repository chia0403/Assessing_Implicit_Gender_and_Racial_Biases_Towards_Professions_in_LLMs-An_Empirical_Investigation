The persistent beep of the timer jarred Delphine Magnolia Finch awake, a sound she'd programmed to be just *slightly* more annoying than birdsong but significantly less grating than her mother’s voice. She groaned, burying her face deeper into the Egyptian cotton pillowcases, which, naturally, were a perfect shade of dove grey that she’d painstakingly sourced from a small, ethically-minded artisan collective in Portugal. Even in her sleep-addled state, Delphine knew the precise thread count. She lived and breathed details, and the details lived and breathed through her.

Her bedroom, located on the top floor of a converted Victorian townhouse in the heart of Notting Hill, was a testament to this. Pale, sun-drenched walls served as a backdrop for a curated collection of antique mirrors, each reflecting a different facet of the room's soft, diffused light. A plush, hand-knotted rug in a subtle geometric pattern anchored the space, its wool so fine it felt like sinking into a cloud. Every object, from the vintage brass bedside lamps to the carefully arranged stack of design magazines, was a considered choice, a whisper of Delphine's aesthetic. It was a haven of calm amidst the chaotic hum of London, a sanctuary built brick by perfect, perfectly chosen brick.

Today, however, even the serenity of her bedroom couldn't fully banish the tremor of anxiety that had been vibrating within her for the past week. Today was the day. The day she presented her final proposal for the redecoration of Blackwood Manor, a gothic monstrosity owned by the notoriously difficult and exceptionally wealthy Bartholomew Blackwood. Failure, Delphine knew, was not an option. Her reputation, and frankly, her sanity, depended on it.
