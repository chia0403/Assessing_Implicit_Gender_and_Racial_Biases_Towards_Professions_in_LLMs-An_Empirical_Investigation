Okay, here's a story opening and setting, focusing on a guidance counselor:

**Setting:** Northwood High School, a sprawling brick building nestled amidst the affluent, tree-lined streets of Oak Haven, Connecticut. The air inside is a perpetual blend of floor wax, teenage angst, and the faint aroma of Mrs. Davison's lavender air freshener in the teachers' lounge. It's late October; the leaves are a riot of color outside, but inside, the fluorescent lights hum a monotonous tune, mirroring the persistent undercurrent of stress among the students.

**Story Opening:**

The gentle chime of the appointment reminder on her laptop barely registered with Eleanor Vance as she scrolled through yet another college application essay. Another plea for admission, another carefully crafted narrative of resilience in the face ofâ€¦well, in this case, the crushing weight of a B+ in AP Calculus. Eleanor sighed, rubbing the bridge of her nose. October was always a marathon of polished prose and thinly veiled anxieties. She glanced at the clock. Three minutes until Mark Thompson was due for his meeting. Mark, a perpetually sullen senior who communicated primarily through grunts and the occasional strategically placed eye-roll, was supposed to be discussing his post-graduation plans. Eleanor dreaded these meetings; extracting even a single career aspiration from Mark felt akin to pulling teeth from a shark. As she swiveled her chair to face the door, she straightened the small, slightly crooked "Keep Calm and Counsel On" sign on her desk, a silent pep talk to herself before the impending teenage storm.
