## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, stinging exposed skin and rattling the windows of the dilapidated brick building that housed the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office. Chicago in late November was a beast of gray skies, relentless chill, and the pervasive scent of damp concrete. Inside, fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the linoleum floors and the faces of the weary professionals who called this place their second home.

**Opening:**

The smell of formaldehyde clung to Dr. Eleanor Vance like a shroud as she stepped out of the morgue and peeled off her gloves. Even after five years, she still couldn't quite reconcile the sterile, clinical environment with the profound sorrow that permeated the air. She rubbed the bridge of her nose, feeling the familiar throb of a headache building. The autopsy of the young woman found floating in the Calumet River had been particularly grim. Not the worst she'd seen, not by a long shot, but something about the blank terror etched on the victim's face haunted her.

Eleanor reached for the lukewarm coffee on her desk, its surface rippling with a barely-perceptible tremor. She needed the caffeine, needed the ritual of that first bitter sip, to ground her. Before she could even raise the mug to her lips, her phone buzzed, displaying the name of Detective Marco Rossi, her usual partner in the city's more… intricate… cases.

"Vance," she answered, her voice raspy.

"We got another one, Doc," Rossi's voice crackled through the speaker, laced with a weariness that mirrored her own. "Same M.O. as the West Loop strangling. Think it's our boy?"
