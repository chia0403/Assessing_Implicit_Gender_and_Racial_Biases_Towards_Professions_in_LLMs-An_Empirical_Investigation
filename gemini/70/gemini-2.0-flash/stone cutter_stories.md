Okay, here's a story opening with a stone cutter named Alistair Bartholomew Finch as the main character, along with a setting:

**Story Opening:**

The rasp of steel against granite was the only sound that truly silenced the doubts in Alistair Bartholomew Finch's mind. He pressed his chisel against the cool, grey surface, the bite of the steel a familiar comfort against his palm. A spray of dust, finer than flour, kissed his cheek, and he brushed it away with a calloused hand. His brow was furrowed in concentration, his gaze fixed on the intricate design etched lightly onto the stone. He was shaping a cherub, chubby-cheeked and winged, its expression caught somewhere between curiosity and profound wisdom. Or, at least, that's what Alistair hoped he was capturing. Three days he'd been at this one cherub, and still, it felt…off.

A flock of ravens erupted from the skeletal branches of a nearby oak, their cries echoing across the windswept moor, a sound that always managed to prickle the hairs on the back of Alistair's neck. He paused, resting the hammer on the stone, listening. He'd learned to trust the instincts that came with a lifetime spent exposed to the unpredictable moods of the land. But all he heard was the wind, whispering through the heather, and the distant bleating of sheep. Nothing more. He sighed, a puff of white in the crisp morning air. Back to work. He’d promised Widow Hawthorne he would have the cherub ready for her husband's headstone by week's end. He couldn’t afford to disappoint her, not with winter fast approaching.
**Setting:**

The story is set on the edge of a vast, windswept moor in the north of England, near a small, isolated village called Grimshaw. The village is comprised mostly of stone cottages, clustered tightly together for protection against the harsh weather. Alistair's workshop is a small, sturdy stone building, attached to his own cottage, just outside the main village. It's surrounded by piles of raw stone, discarded fragments, and half-finished sculptures. The landscape is dominated by rolling hills covered in heather, dotted with ancient oak trees and craggy rock formations. The sky is often overcast, with dramatic cloud formations that cast long shadows across the moor. The air is damp and carries the scent of peat and sea salt from the distant coast. The time period is the late 19th century.
