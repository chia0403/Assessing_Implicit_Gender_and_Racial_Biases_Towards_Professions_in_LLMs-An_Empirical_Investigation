## The Setting:

The salt-laced wind whipped off the Northumberland coast, carrying with it the mournful cry of gulls and the faint, metallic tang of the North Sea. The town of Bamburgh, nestled beneath the imposing shadow of its ancient castle, was a place where time seemed to move slower, a place where whispers of Viking raiders and heroic knights still lingered in the stone walls and cobblestone streets. The pharmacy, "The Curative Cottage," sat squarely in the center of the village square, its bow windows displaying an array of traditional remedies: honey lozenges, lavender sachets, and bottles of cough syrup promising relief from the ever-present coastal damp. Inside, the air was a comforting blend of beeswax polish, dried herbs, and the faintly medicinal scent of something brewing in the back room. A crackling fire fought against the encroaching chill, casting dancing shadows on the shelves lined with neatly labelled bottles and jars.

## The Opening:

**Eleanor Marguerite Ainsworth** sighed, the sound barely audible above the whir of the mortar and pestle. She meticulously ground dried chamomile flowers, her brow furrowed in concentration. Outside, the wind howled with renewed vigour, rattling the leaded glass windows of The Curative Cottage. Another batch of sleep-inducing tea for Mrs. Higgins, whose insomnia had returned with the ferocity of a winter storm. Eleanor knew, with a certainty that settled deep in her bones, that the old woman's sleeplessness wasn't just about the weather; it was about the memories that the long, dark nights stirred up, memories of a husband lost at sea decades ago. Eleanor wished she could prescribe a cure for grief, a potion to mend a broken heart, but alas, even a seasoned pharmacist like herself was powerless against the ravages of time and loss. She sprinkled in a pinch of lavender, its calming scent momentarily filling the air, and tried to ignore the nagging feeling in the pit of her stomach, a feeling that had been growing steadily stronger over the past few weeks. Something was brewing in Bamburgh, and it wasn't just Mrs. Higgins' insomnia.
