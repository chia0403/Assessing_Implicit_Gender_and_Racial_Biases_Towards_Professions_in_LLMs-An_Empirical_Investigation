The air hung thick with the sweet, yeasty promise of a new day, even before the sun had dared to peek over the cobblestone rooftops. Inside "The Golden Crumb," flour dusted every surface like a freshly fallen snow. A radio, perched precariously on a stack of mixing bowls, crackled with static before settling into a jaunty polka tune. This was the domain of Seraphina Clementine Thorne, baker extraordinaire and proprietor of the most beloved bakery in the quaint, seaside town of Port Blossom. 

Seraphina, her auburn hair hastily braided and escaping in mischievous tendrils around her flour-dusted face, hummed along to the music as she kneaded a massive lump of dough. Her strong, capable hands, scarred from years of navigating hot ovens and sticky caramel, worked the dough with a rhythmic grace. She loved this time of day, before the clatter of customers and the ringing of the bell. This quiet, peaceful prelude was her sanctuary, a space where she could pour her heart and soul into the simple act of creation. Today's masterpiece was her signature sea salt and rosemary sourdough, a local favorite that had earned her a coveted spot in the Port Blossom Summer Festival's baking competition. And, if she was honest with herself, it was the key to finally catching the attention of the stubbornly oblivious harbor master, Elias Vance.
