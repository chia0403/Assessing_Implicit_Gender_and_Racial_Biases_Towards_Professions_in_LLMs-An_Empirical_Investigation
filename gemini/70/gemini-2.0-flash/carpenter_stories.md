The scent of cedar and sawdust hung thick in the air, clinging to everything like a forgotten promise. Outside, the relentless Pacific rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the workshop, a drumming rhythm that Mary-Anne Carpenter had grown accustomed to over the years. But today, the drumming felt less like a lullaby and more like a frantic plea.

Mary-Anne, her hands calloused and stained with varnish, ran a thumb across the smooth grain of the mahogany chest she was painstakingly restoring. She knew the wood intimately, each swirl and knot a familiar landmark in the landscape of her craft. For twenty-three years, her life had been inextricably linked to wood: shaping it, coaxing out its beauty, breathing new life into pieces discarded and forgotten.

The workshop, a converted barn on the outskirts of the small, windswept coastal town of Seabrook, Washington, was her sanctuary. Every tool held a memory, every piece of lumber whispered a story. Sunlight, when it dared to pierce through the ever-present clouds, streamed through the dusty windows, illuminating floating motes of wood dust like tiny, ethereal dancers. But on days like this, shrouded in grey, the barn felt more like a lonely echo chamber, amplifying the gnawing unease that had been steadily building in Mary-Anneâ€™s chest for weeks.
