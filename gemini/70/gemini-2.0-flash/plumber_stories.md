Okay, here's a story opening and setting, including the full name of our plumber protagonist:

**Opening:**

The scream echoed from the depths of the Victorian manor like a strangled bird, momentarily silencing the incessant drip-drip-drip coming from somewhere deep within the bowels of the house. Bartholomew "Bart" Finch, wrench still clutched in his gloved hand, winced. That was definitely Mrs. Everly, and that was definitely not the sound of someone who'd merely discovered a leaky faucet. Bart sighed. He'd hoped for a quiet afternoon unclogging a drain; he'd feared something like this.

**Setting:**

The Everly Manor loomed on the highest point of the blustery Cornish coastline. A gothic monstrosity of grey stone and gargoyles, it had been passed down through generations of Everlys, each adding their own touch of questionable architectural taste. Inside, it was a labyrinth of dimly lit hallways, cluttered rooms filled with antique furniture draped in dust sheets, and the constant, unsettling feeling of being watched. The air was thick with the scent of mildew and something vaguely floral, a cloying perfume that Mrs. Everly favored. A constant dampness clung to everything, no doubt exacerbated by the manor's proximity to the sea and the labyrinthine, ancient plumbing that Bart Finch had been trying to wrangle into submission for the better part of a week. The main bathroom where Bart was last working was large and opulent, featuring gold fittings, a claw-foot tub, and a stained-glass window depicting a particularly grim scene from the Book of Revelation.
