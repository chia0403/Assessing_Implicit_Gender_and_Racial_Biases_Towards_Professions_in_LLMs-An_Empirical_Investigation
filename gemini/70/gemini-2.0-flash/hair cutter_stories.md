Okay, here's a story opening and setting for you, featuring a main character who's a hair cutter:

**Setting:**

The year is 2042.  Neon signs still flicker and hum, but now they advertise personalized gene therapies and drone-delivered sushi.  Rainy nights in Neo-Tokyo feel more Blade Runner than classic Tokyo. The air, though filtered in the wealthier districts, still carries a metallic tang.  Technology has permeated every aspect of life, from the augmented reality overlays that paint vibrant scenes onto drab buildings to the bio-engineered hair dyes that shift color with mood. Amidst the gleaming towers and crowded virtual plazas, you find a small, anachronistic shop tucked away on a side street in Shinjuku Golden Gai. The sign above the doorway is faded and handwritten, simply stating: "Mizushima's Cuts."  The shop itself is a haven of analog comfort. Old barber chairs, well-worn wooden floors, and the scent of traditional hair tonics create a stark contrast to the digital world outside.

**Opening:**

A low hum emanated from the climate-controlled artificial scalp resting on the counter.  Hiroki Mizushima, his slender fingers expertly wielding a pair of antique, hand-forged shears, examined the simulated hair under the soft glow of an incandescent bulb.  He adjusted his half-moon reading glasses, the only concession he allowed to modern technology, and sighed. He was never truly happy with the artificial feel, and the smell, he would almost prefer the metallic scent of the streets outside.  His reflection stared back from the mirror behind the counter, a gaunt, bespectacled face framed by thinning, greying hair that he stubbornly refused to dye, bio-engineered or otherwise.

"Another 'Cyber-Chop' request," Hiroki muttered, his voice raspy from years of breathing in hair dust and the lingering scent of nostalgia.  He disliked these requests, these modern monstrosities with integrated neural implants and fiber-optic strands woven through the hair to create dazzling displays. They felt inauthentic, devoid of soul. But business was business, and even the most steadfast traditionalist had to adapt, at least a little, to survive in Neo-Tokyo.

He adjusted the angle of the scalp and carefully snipped a section of the synthetic hair. He couldn't bring himself to use the laser cutters. It would feel sacrilegious. His scissors still held the spirits of those who sat in his chair before, and he honored their memory by using them every day, by continuing to hone his craft, even if the craft itself was becoming something he barely recognized.
