## Story Opening:

The rhythmic thump of bass vibrated through Amelia Grace Hawthorne's chest, a familiar comfort in the controlled chaos of her "Booty Blast & Burn" class. Twenty-three bodies, clad in neon leggings and sweat-wicking tanks, pulsed to the beat, synchronized in their lunges and squats. Amelia, perched on the small, mirrored stage at the front of the room, her own ponytail bouncing in perfect time, grinned. This was her sanctuary.

Except, tonight, the sanctuary felt… off. A prickling unease crawled beneath Amelia's skin, a subtle disharmony in the symphony of exertion. The fluorescent lights seemed to flicker a little too brightly, casting unsettling shadows in the corners. The faces of her regulars, usually flushed with exertion and endorphins, seemed strained, almost… apprehensive. Amelia tried to shake it off. Maybe it was just the new pre-workout blend she’d tried.

"Alright, ladies! Twenty more jump squats! Feel the burn! Feel the power!" she shouted, injecting her voice with her signature infectious enthusiasm. She dropped down, joining them in the exercise, willing herself to focus on the movement, on the lactic acid building in her thighs. But even as her muscles screamed in protest, the feeling persisted. Something was definitely wrong.

## Setting:

The story unfolds primarily in **"Studio Soul,"** a brightly lit, modern fitness studio nestled in the up-and-coming arts district of **Port Blossom, Oregon.** The studio itself is a kaleidoscope of vibrant colors: one wall is a sprawling mural of abstract flowers in bold hues, another is completely mirrored, reflecting the energy of the classes. Large windows offer a panoramic view of the Pacific Ocean, although the evening classes usually only see a dark, choppy expanse.

Studio Soul is more than just a gym; it's a community hub. It offers a variety of classes, from yoga and Pilates to kickboxing and Zumba. The front desk is always buzzing with activity, staffed by friendly faces who know all the members by name. A juice bar in the corner dispenses protein shakes and healthy smoothies, fueling the bodies and spirits of Port Blossom's health-conscious residents. But despite the optimistic atmosphere, a sense of hidden history clings to the building, a whisper of secrets buried beneath the polished floors and cheerful decor.
