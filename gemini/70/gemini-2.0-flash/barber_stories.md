## Story Opening:

The first snip echoed in the quiet of the shop like a dropped pin. Salvatore "Sal" Genovese paused, the silver glint of his scissors catching the weak morning light. He held his breath, listening. Just the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock he’d inherited from his own barber father, and the distant hum of the city waking up beyond the frosted glass window. No, not this time. Still, a tremor of anticipation, a prickle of unease, settled on the back of his neck like a stray hair. He resumed his work, the scissors now moving with a deliberate, almost theatrical, slowness. The old man in the chair, Mr. Henderson, was mostly deaf and wouldn’t notice the subtle hesitation. But Sal noticed. He always noticed. He had to.

## Setting:

**Genovese's Traditional Barbershop** sat nestled on a forgotten corner of Mulberry Street in Little Italy, New York City. The shop was a time capsule, a haven of old-world charm amidst the encroaching modernity. The walls were papered in a faded, floral print, its original vibrancy long muted by years of cigarette smoke and the general wear and tear of a life lived well. Three sturdy, leather barber chairs, each a vintage masterpiece, stood like silent sentinels facing a large, ornate mirror. Jars of Blue Magic hair grease and Bay Rum aftershave lined the shelves, their labels yellowed and chipped. The air perpetually smelled of talcum powder, sandalwood soap, and the faint, metallic tang of freshly honed steel. Sunlight, filtered through the dusty window, painted stripes across the checkered tile floor. Genovese's was more than just a barbershop; it was a community hub, a living testament to a bygone era, and a refuge for those who appreciated the simple pleasures of a clean shave and good conversation.
