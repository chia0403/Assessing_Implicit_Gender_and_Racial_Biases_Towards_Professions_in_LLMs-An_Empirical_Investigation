## Story Opening & Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The fondant was sweating. Not a delicate, pearlescent gleam, mind you, but a full-blown, shimmering sheen of sugary anxiety. Geneva Rosewood, her tongue pressed between her teeth in concentration, gently dabbed at the offending moisture with a corner of a pristine white linen. "Don't you dare," she muttered under her breath, "I'm almost there. Almost..." The clock ticked with a malevolent precision, each second a tiny hammer blow to her already fraying nerves. She needed to finish this cake, and finish it *perfectly*. It wasn’t just any cake; it was for Mrs. Van Derlyn’s centenary, and that meant everything in the town of Honeysuckle Hollow. 

**Setting:**

Geneva’s world, "Sweet Surrender" as she’d ambitiously named her bakery, was a symphony of sugar. Nestled on the corner of Main Street in the idyllic town of Honeysuckle Hollow, Pennsylvania, the bakery was all sunshine and pastel hues. Walls painted a soft butter yellow were adorned with framed photographs of Geneva's award-winning creations: delicate sugar roses cascading down tiered wedding cakes, whimsical gingerbread cottages that seemed plucked straight from a fairytale, and elaborately sculpted animal cakes that brought joy to countless children's birthday parties. The air perpetually hummed with the warm, comforting aroma of baking vanilla and melting chocolate. 

Beyond the display cases overflowing with colourful macarons, plump cupcakes, and tempting tarts, lay Geneva's sanctuary: the kitchen. Stainless steel counters shone under the bright fluorescent lights, reflecting the mountains of bowls, whisks, spatulas, and every conceivable cake decorating tool imaginable. It was a haven of order amidst the inherent chaos of her craft, a place where Geneva could transform simple ingredients into edible works of art. Today, however, that sanctuary felt more like a pressure cooker.
