The dust swirled around Jedediah "Jed" Riley's boots, a rusty ochre haze that painted the setting sun a sickly orange. Jedediah, a man built like an oak tree felled just right, squinted against the glare, his calloused hands gripping the worn metal of the excavatorâ€™s joystick. He wiped a streak of grime from his forehead with the back of his forearm, leaving a muddy smear across his already weathered skin. The air hung thick and heavy, smelling of diesel and dry earth.

He was perched atop "Behemoth," his faithful Komatsu PC400LC-6 excavator, on the edge of what used to be Old Man Fitzwilliam's prized pumpkin patch. Now, it was a churned-up, scarred landscape, destined to become the foundation for the new, multi-million dollar luxury condos "Sunset Ridge Estates." Fitzwilliam had held out for years, bless his stubborn soul, but in the end, progress, and a hefty sum of money, had prevailed. Jed felt a pang of guilt every time he saw the wilting remnants of the giant pumpkins, half-buried in the dirt, their cheerful orange a stark contrast to the industrial grey of the machinery.

The setting was Willow Creek, a small, rapidly changing town nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. It was a place where generations of families had made a living farming the fertile land, but now, big money was creeping in, turning fields into golf courses and quiet country roads into congested arteries. Jed, born and raised in Willow Creek, felt the push and pull of that change every day, the familiar scent of freshly turned soil now mixed with the faint, unwelcome aroma of chlorine and new asphalt. He loved his town, loved the land, but he also loved his job, and this job paid damn well. He just hoped, as he brought Behemoth back to life with a guttural roar, that the new folks would appreciate the beauty they were building upon, and not just pave it all over with profit.
