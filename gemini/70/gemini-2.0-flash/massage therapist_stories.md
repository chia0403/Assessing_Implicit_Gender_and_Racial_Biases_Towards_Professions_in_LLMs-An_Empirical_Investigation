**Story Opening:**

The rhythmic thump-thump-thumping of K-pop bass vibrated through the floorboards of the converted Victorian house, a constant hum beneath the gentle new age music Aurora always played in her treatment room. Today, however, the competing sounds felt less like ambient noise and more like a harbinger of doom. Aurora Isabelle Rossi took a deep breath, the scent of lavender and eucalyptus doing little to soothe the knot tightening in her stomach. Her next client was Silas Blackwood. Silas. Blackwood. The name alone sounded like a gothic romance novel gone wrong. He was a new client, referred by a woman whose lower back Aurora had essentially resurrected after a particularly nasty skiing accident. But Mrs. Abernathy, bless her heart, had neglected to mention the "rumors" swirling around Mr. Blackwood like a persistent fog. Rumors of intense, brooding eyes, a mysterious past, and a habit of paying in cash, large bills only.

**Setting:**

The setting is a quaint, slightly bohemian town nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains called Harmony Creek. Aurora owns and operates a small, independent massage therapy practice called "Sanctuary of Touch" in a converted Victorian house on the edge of the town square. The house is painted a soft, inviting sage green with intricate white trim. Inside, the waiting room is filled with comfortable, mismatched furniture, overflowing bookshelves featuring titles on mindfulness and herbal remedies, and an eclectic collection of local art. Aurora's treatment room is a haven of tranquility, painted a calming blue, with soft lighting, a comfortable massage table draped in plush, cream-colored linens, and a curated collection of crystals and essential oil diffusers designed to create a truly restorative experience. The K-pop music, much to Aurora's chagrin, emanates from the trendy bubble tea shop that recently opened next door, a jarring contrast to the peaceful atmosphere she cultivates.
