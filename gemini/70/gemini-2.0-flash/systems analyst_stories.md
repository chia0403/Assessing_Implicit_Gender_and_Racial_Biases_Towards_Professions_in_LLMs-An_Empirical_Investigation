The hum of the server room was Amelia Jane Davies's lullaby. Not a soothing one, mind you, more like a persistent, droning mosquito that drilled into her skull. She pulled a strand of auburn hair from her mouth, the metallic tang of recycled air clinging to it. It was 3:17 AM, according to the glow-in-the-dark numbers on her wristwatch, and the blinking red lights of Rack 42 were mocking her.

Amelia, a systems analyst with a penchant for oversized sweaters and an even bigger appetite for problem-solving, was currently battling the gremlins inhabiting the hospital’s new patient database. It was supposed to be a seamless transition from the old system, a gleaming example of efficiency and modernization that would streamline patient care and reduce paperwork. Instead, it was spitting out gibberish, randomly assigning diagnoses of ‘acute rubber ducky deficiency’ to seventy-year-old men and labelling toddlers as ‘suspected space aliens.’

The setting was the bowels of St. Augustine’s Hospital in Portland, Oregon. Not the sleek, modern wing with its panoramic views of the Willamette River, but the concrete underbelly where the building's nervous system resided. The server room was a claustrophobic rectangle, filled with the whirring, blinking, and occasionally sparking innards of the digital age. Wires snaked across the floor like metallic vines, and the air conditioning struggled valiantly, but unsuccessfully, to combat the oppressive heat generated by the banks of servers. Coffee cups, empty energy drink cans, and crumpled wrappers littered the floor around Amelia's makeshift workspace – a folding chair and a laptop precariously balanced on a wheeled cart. The only window offered a view of a brick wall and the occasional scurrying shadow, presumably a rat also trying to escape the oppressive heat. Tonight, however, Amelia was too focused to notice. Tonight, she was at war with the machines, and she was determined to win.
