The acrid smell of burnt coffee clung to the air in the cluttered office, a testament to Amelia Stone's all-nighter. Empty takeout containers overflowed from a nearby wastebasket, and stacks of newspapers threatened to topple from every available surface. The low hum of the city, a constant drone even at this ungodly hour, seeped through the grimy windows of her cramped cubicle at *The Daily Chronicle*. Amelia rubbed her tired eyes, the flickering fluorescent lights doing little to alleviate the gritty feeling.

Amelia Stone was a woman fueled by caffeine and righteous anger. She was a journalist with a nose for trouble and an uncanny ability to sniff out a story where others saw nothing. For the past five years, she'd been a staple at *The Daily Chronicle*, a mid-sized newspaper known for its gritty reporting on the underbelly of New Harbor, a coastal city teeming with both breathtaking beauty and insidious corruption.

New Harbor, Massachusetts, was her setting. A picturesque city of weathered brick buildings clinging to steep hills overlooking a shimmering harbor dotted with sailboats. Tourist shops selling overpriced nautical trinkets lined the cobblestone streets, a facade that masked the deep-seated rot festering beneath. Generations of families, clinging to fishing traditions that were rapidly fading, lived side-by-side with newly arrived tech millionaires, creating a volatile mix of resentment and desperation. It was a city of contrasts, a breeding ground for secrets, and a place where Amelia Stone felt both utterly exhausted and completely alive.
