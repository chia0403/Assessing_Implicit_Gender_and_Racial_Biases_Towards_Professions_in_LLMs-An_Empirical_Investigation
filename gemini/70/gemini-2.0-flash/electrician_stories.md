The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, stinging Harold Peterson's cheeks as he wrestled with the stubborn access panel on the rooftop HVAC unit. It was a Tuesday in late November, the kind of day that made you question all your life choices, particularly the one that led you to a career dangling hundreds of feet in the air, battling both faulty wiring and the elements. Chicago was a symphony of grey below him - grey buildings, grey sky, grey lake, all conspiring to suck the warmth right out of his bones. He pulled his worn, leather work gloves tighter, cursing under his breath as the rusty screws refused to budge. Harold was a meticulous man, a master electrician with a reputation for solving problems others couldnâ€™t even diagnose. But right now, all he felt was cold, tired, and increasingly frustrated. This rooftop, perched atop the iconic Wrigley Building, wasn't his favorite job site, but Mrs. Abernathy, the building manager, was a good client, and a promise was a promise. Besides, the view, when the weather cooperated, was breathtaking. Today, however, it was just another reminder of the city's relentless grip.
