**Setting:** The Teatro del Popolo in Siena, Italy. It’s late October, the kind of cool that creeps into your bones even through the thick stone walls. The ancient theatre, built into the skeleton of a medieval palace, is cavernous and dimly lit, save for the harsh glare of the work lights focused on the stage. Dust motes dance in the beams, illuminated like tiny performers in their own silent drama. The air hangs heavy with the scent of aged velvet, damp plaster, and the lingering ghost of a thousand forgotten performances.

**Opening:**

The screech of metal on metal echoed through the empty theatre, making Amelia Beatrice Bellini jump. She swore under her breath, almost choking on the thick dust, and tightened her grip on the heavy wrench. Another stubborn bolt. She’d been wrestling with this damn set piece – a crumbling facade meant to represent a Roman villa – for the better part of an hour. The Teatro del Popolo, glorious as it was, seemed determined to sabotage her at every turn. It was as if the ghosts of playwrights past were whispering grievances into the very mortar, inciting mechanical mutiny.

Amelia, clad in paint-splattered overalls and a perpetually frustrated frown, wiped a bead of sweat from her brow with the back of her hand, leaving a muddy smear. She glanced at her watch. Nearly midnight. The rest of the cast and crew had long since departed, collapsing into bed or seeking solace in the nearest trattoria. But Amelia couldn’t leave. Not yet. She needed this blasted villa to stand proud, even if it was only for a three-week run of Euripides’ *Iphigenia in Aulis*. She needed it to breathe the very air of ancient Greece, to whisper tales of gods and sacrifice. Tonight, it felt more like it was trying to suffocate her with its stubborn inertia.
