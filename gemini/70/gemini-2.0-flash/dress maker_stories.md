## Story Opening:

The scent of rosewater and regret hung heavy in the air of the atelier, clinging to the velvet drapes and the silk scraps that littered the floor like fallen confetti. Agatha Bellefleur sighed, pushing a stray curl of chestnut hair from her forehead with a hand pricked raw from pins. Outside, the Parisian rain hammered against the arched window of her studio on Rue de Rivoli, a relentless rhythm mirroring the relentless ache in her heart. She’d promised herself she wouldn't think about him today, not with the Duchesse de Valois' wedding gown only days from completion. But the delicate, pearl-encrusted bodice, so reminiscent of the one she'd envisioned for her own wedding, mocked her with its perfect, unattainable beauty. She was a dressmaker, a creator of dreams for others, but her own had been stitched shut long ago.

## Setting:

**Paris, 1888:** The atelier of Agatha Bellefleur, located on the fashionable Rue de Rivoli. The room is a riot of colour and texture, a testament to Agatha's artistry and her passion. Walls are draped in fabrics of every imaginable shade, from the deepest indigo to the palest blush pink. Bolts of silk, velvet, and lace are stacked high on shelves, interspersed with antique mannequins adorned with half-finished creations. Sunlight, when it manages to pierce the Parisian gloom, illuminates dust motes dancing in the air, catching the glint of beads and sequins. A large cutting table dominates the centre of the room, surrounded by sketches, swatches, and discarded threads. The air is thick with the aroma of beeswax, lavender, and the faint, metallic tang of iron from the antique sewing machine humming quietly in the corner. A single, ornate birdcage hangs near the window, usually occupied by Agatha’s canary, Coco, but today, the cage is empty, mirroring the empty space in Agatha’s heart. The overall impression is one of organized chaos, a beautiful, vibrant space that both reflects and fuels Agatha's creativity.
