## Story Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

The ringing of the telephone sliced through the Monday morning calm of "Wanderlust Destinations," yanking Eleanor Penelope Thorne from her reverie. Eleanor, staring out at the perpetually grey Seattle sky, had been imagining herself on the sun-drenched beaches of Santorini, a mental escape she indulged in most mornings to combat the creeping dreariness. Sighing, she scooped up the receiver, pasting on her most cheerful customer-service voice.

"Wanderlust Destinations, Eleanor speaking! How can I help you plan your next adventure?" She swiveled back to her computer, her fingers hovering over the keyboard, ready to conjure up images of exotic locales for the caller. But the voice on the other end was anything but a request for a relaxing vacation. It was a low, gravelly whisper, thick with an accent Eleanor couldn't quite place.

"I need you to find someone," the voice hissed, "Someone who disappeared… ten years ago. And the destination? It's not on any map you have, Miss Thorne. It's… closer to hell than heaven."

Eleanor's carefully constructed smile crumbled. This was definitely not the booking inquiry she'd been expecting.

**Setting:**

Wanderlust Destinations was nestled in a prime location in Seattle's trendy Ballard neighborhood. The small, brightly painted office was a haven for the travel-obsessed. Posters of iconic landmarks plastered the walls – the Eiffel Tower, the pyramids of Giza, the Great Wall of China – each carefully curated to inspire wanderlust in even the most grounded souls.

Eleanor's desk was a carefully organized chaos, a testament to her dedication. Folders overflowed with brochures from far-flung destinations, maps were strategically placed, and a miniature globe sat perched precariously on a stack of travel guides. Sunlight, when it dared to peek through the Seattle gloom, filtered through the large front window, illuminating the dust motes dancing in the air and casting a warm glow on the framed photo of Eleanor backpacking through Southeast Asia, a younger, more carefree version of herself smiling widely.

The overall atmosphere was one of vibrant optimism and the promise of adventure, a stark contrast to the increasingly unsettling phone call Eleanor was now trying to navigate. The cheerful posters suddenly felt menacing, the vibrant colours almost garish. The promise of adventure felt more like a threat.
