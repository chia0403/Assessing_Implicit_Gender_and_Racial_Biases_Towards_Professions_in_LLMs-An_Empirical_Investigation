## Story Opening:

The midday sun, filtered through the grimy windows of "O'Malley & Sons, Shipping and Salvage," turned Agnes Beatrice Plumtree's ledger into a hazy grid of numbers. She squinted, her brow furrowed in a perpetual state of concern. It was the seventh of August, 1948, and already the ledger was threatening to burst at its brittle seams. O'Malley & Sons was a chaotic symphony of invoices, debts, and half-paid bills, all swirling around her like a particularly persistent swarm of wasps. Agnes, however, was unflappable. She was a rock in their stormy financial sea, a woman who could wrestle a balanced equation from even the most improbable of accounts. At least, she usually was. Today, however, the numbers were simply refusing to cooperate. A discrepancy of precisely Â£3 7s 6d stared back at her, mocking her meticulous efforts.

Agnes sighed, a small puff of air that barely disturbed the dust motes dancing in the sunbeams. She pushed her spectacles further up her nose, their wire frames digging slightly into the bridge. Outside, the guttural roar of the tugboats echoed across the docks, a sound she'd grown so accustomed to she barely noticed it anymore.

## Setting:

**O'Malley & Sons, Shipping and Salvage**, occupied a prime piece of real estate on the bustling docks of Liverpool. The building itself was a towering brick structure, stained with the grit and grime of decades of industrial activity. Seagulls screeched overhead, their calls mingling with the clanging of cranes and the shouted orders of stevedores. The air hung thick with the smell of salt, diesel, and the faint, decaying scent of the nearby Mersey River.

Agnes' office, a cramped cubicle tucked away in the back of the main warehouse, was a haven of order amidst the surrounding chaos. Stacks of ledgers and invoices threatened to topple from overflowing shelves, but each one was meticulously labelled and dated. A sturdy oak desk, worn smooth by years of use, was her command center. A single, battered typewriter sat squarely in the middle, its keys worn down from countless hours of tireless work. A faded portrait of a dour-looking gentleman, presumably one of the original O'Malleys, hung askew on the wall, silently judging her every entry. A small, chipped teacup rested precariously on a stack of invoices, a testament to Agnes' daily battle against exhaustion and the never-ending tide of paperwork.
