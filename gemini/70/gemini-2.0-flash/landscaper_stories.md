## Story Opening:

The incessant buzzing clawed its way into Elias Vance's consciousness like a persistent weed in a prize-winning rosebush. He groaned, burying his face further into the threadbare pillow, but the tiny, infuriating drone wouldn't relent. Reluctantly, he pried open an eye, squinting at the source of the disturbance: his alarm clock, squatting on the dusty bedside table like a judgmental gnome. 5:30 AM. Another day battling the stubborn will of nature, and, if he was being honest with himself, his own growing disillusionment.

He slapped the snooze button, buying himself a precious nine minutes of semi-consciousness, punctuated by the mournful cooing of pigeons outside his window. Elias knew he should get up. He had a big job today: taming the sprawling wilderness that Mrs. Penelope Featherstonehaugh called her "country garden." The thought of her impeccably manicured nails and disdainful glances was enough to coax him out of bed. He swung his legs over the side, the cold floor a stark reminder that autumn was tightening its grip on Havenwood.

## Setting:

Elias lives in the small, coastal town of **Havenwood, Maine.** Havenwood is the kind of place where the scent of salt hangs perpetually in the air, clinging to everything like a tenacious vine. Weathered clapboard houses, painted in shades of faded blue and seafoam green, line the narrow streets, often obscured by overflowing window boxes bursting with petunias and geraniums. It's a town steeped in history, built on the bones of shipbuilding and fishing industries, now largely sustained by tourism and the influx of wealthy summer residents.

Elias's own home is a small, somewhat dilapidated cottage on the outskirts of town, inherited from his grandfather. It's charming in its own way, overgrown with rambling roses and a tangle of honeysuckle that threatens to engulf the entire structure. The interior is simple and functional, reflecting Elias's pragmatic nature. Tools are neatly organized in the shed behind the house, and his battered pickup truck, "Old Bess," is a constant presence in the gravel driveway. While he loves the quiet solitude of his little haven, Elias feels a pang of isolation from time to time, a sense of being rooted in a past that is slowly fading away, just like the vibrant colors of autumn giving way to the starkness of winter.
