## Story Opening:

The stale coffee, brewed hours ago, was beginning to taste of regret, much like her Tuesdays. Eleanor Abigail Thorne, Probation Officer Level 3 for the County of Riverside, swirled the tepid liquid in her chipped mug. It painted a weak, brown vortex against the ceramic, mirroring the circling anxieties in her stomach. Outside, the California sun, usually a beacon of optimism, was veiled by a layer of smog thick enough to choke a redwood. Eleanor sighed, leaning back in her worn-out, faux leather chair. Another Tuesday, another parade of people who'd made choices she couldn't fathom, all expecting her to fix what they had so expertly broken. Today's agenda included a domestic abuser with a penchant for miniature dachshunds, a teen caught tagging a church with explicit limericks, and a middle-aged woman whose "misunderstanding" about the purpose of the neighborhood watch group involved tasering a squirrel. Eleanor took another sip of the awful coffee, the bitterness a grim reminder that she had, once again, forgotten to set her alarm. This day was already starting downhill. And she hadn't even opened the first file yet.

## Setting:

The setting is the Riverside County Probation Department, located in a nondescript, two-story building on the outskirts of Riverside, California. The building itself is a study in beige - beige walls, beige carpet, beige cubicles. Fluorescent lights hum incessantly, casting a sterile, unflattering glow. The air is perpetually stale, a mixture of cheap cleaning products, stale coffee, and underlying anxiety.

Eleanor's office, a cramped cubicle carved out of a larger open space, reflects her personality: organized chaos. Files are stacked neatly on her desk, categorized by case number and color-coded for urgency. Post-it notes, adorned with reminders and inspirational quotes, cover her computer monitor. A small succulent, named "Hope," sits precariously on the edge of her desk, a tiny splash of green in the beige wasteland. A framed photograph of Eleanor hiking in the Joshua Tree National Park hangs on the wall, a reminder of the beauty that still exists beyond the concrete jungle of her daily life. The overall impression is one of a hard-working individual attempting to inject a little bit of humanity into a system that often feels dehumanizing.
