The fluorescent lights of Smile Solutions buzzed with a predictable hum, a sound that usually faded into background noise for Gwendolyn Abigail Bellweather. Today, however, the hum felt like a discordant orchestra tuning up for a particularly dreadful performance. Gwendolyn sighed, adjusted her starched white coat, and stared out the large window at the relentlessly cheerful suburban landscape of Sunnyvale, California.

It was the kind of place where a chipped tooth was a social faux pas punishable by ostracization. Perfect for a dental practice, arguably. Soul-crushing for a woman with Gwendolyn's romantic heart, decidedly.
