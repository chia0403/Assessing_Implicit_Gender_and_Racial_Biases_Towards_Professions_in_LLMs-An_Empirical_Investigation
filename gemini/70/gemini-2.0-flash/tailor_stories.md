The needle, a gleaming silver fish in Elias Thorne's capable hand, darted and weaved through the fine Irish linen. Elias, a man whose age was hinted at in the silver dusting his sideburns but betrayed by the unwavering focus in his clear blue eyes, hummed a tuneless melody under his breath. He was a tailor, and not just any tailor. Elias Thorne was, arguably, the finest tailor in Oakhaven.

His shop, "Thorne's Threads," was a haven of muted colours and comforting scents. Sunlight streamed through the tall, arched windows, illuminating bolts of fabrics that ranged from sturdy tweeds the colour of heather to shimmering silks the hue of a summer sky. The air was thick with the subtle aroma of beeswax, lanolin, and old paper patterns, a comforting olfactory tapestry woven over decades. Shelves lined the walls, overflowing with spools of thread in every imaginable shade, buttons crafted from mother-of-pearl and polished wood, and measuring tapes that coiled like sleeping snakes. The floorboards, worn smooth by countless footsteps, creaked a gentle rhythm with Elias’s movements.

Oakhaven itself was a town steeped in tradition, nestled in a valley where the River Willow snaked its way through rolling green hills. Life moved at a slower pace here. The townsfolk, mostly farmers and tradesmen, appreciated quality and craftsmanship, qualities Elias Thorne embodied in every stitch he made. He knew them all by name, had measured their shoulders and inseams for generations, and understood, perhaps better than they did themselves, what they needed to face the world, one carefully crafted garment at a time. Today, however, his brow was furrowed in concentration, his humming replaced with a slight pursing of his lips. The commission he was working on wasn't for a sturdy hunting coat or a simple tweed skirt; it was for something far more… unusual.
