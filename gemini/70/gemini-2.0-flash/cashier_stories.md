The fluorescent lights of the "Quick Stop Groceries" hummed a monotonous tune, a sound that Beatrice Eleanor Ainsworth had long since learned to filter out. It was 7:15 AM, the air thick with the scent of stale coffee and the lingering musk of disinfectant from the night cleaning crew. Beatrice, adjusting the collar of her slightly-too-small, pale blue uniform shirt, watched Mrs. Henderson, the early bird regular, hobble toward her register with a single banana and a copy of the National Enquirer.

Quick Stop Groceries sat on the corner of Elm Street and Maple Avenue in the sleepy, almost aggressively ordinary town of Havenwood, Ohio. Havenwood was the kind of place where everyone knew everyone else's business, where the biggest excitement was the annual bake sale, and where Beatrice felt, more often than not, like a square peg in a perfectly round hole. The store itself was a monument to suburban blandness: linoleum floors, neatly stacked shelves of processed food, and a color palette designed to induce a state of contented consumerism. Outside, the morning sun was just beginning to peek over the rows of identical houses, painting the manicured lawns in a soft, golden light. It was a picture-perfect scene, a tableau of American normalcy, and Beatrice, as she braced herself for Mrs. Henderson's usual diatribe about the outrageous price of bananas, felt a familiar yearning for something, anything, that wasn't quite soâ€¦beige.
