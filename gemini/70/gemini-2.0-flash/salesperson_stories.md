## Story Opening & Setting:

**Opening:**

The smell of burnt coffee clung to the air like a stubborn salesman refusing to take "no" for an answer. Arthur Bartholomew Finch grimaced, swiping at the faint greasy film that coated his desk. Heâ€™d meant to toss the dregs from yesterday, but yesterday had bled into today with barely a break, a relentless tide of missed quotas and hang-ups. He ran a hand over his thinning hair, the fluorescent lights of the office reflecting harshly off his balding pate. 

Another day, another chance. Another chance to convince someone, anyone, that they desperately needed a lifetime supply of industrial-strength floor wax. 

He took a deep, shuddering breath, plastered on a smile that felt more like a grimace, and picked up the phone. "Good morning, Apex Cleaning Supplies, Arthur Bartholomew Finch speaking! How can I make your floors shine today?" The dial tone mocked him. He slammed the receiver down, the sound echoing in the cavernous, half-empty office.

**Setting:**

Arthur works at **Apex Cleaning Supplies, a B2B wholesaler of cleaning products** nestled in a grimy industrial park on the outskirts of **Gary, Indiana**. The office is a bleak, open-plan space divided by low, fabric-covered partitions. Most of the cubicles are vacant, relics of a time when Apex was a thriving company. Now, only a handful of veteran salespeople, clinging to their jobs like barnacles to a sinking ship, remain.

The walls are painted a depressing shade of beige, peeling in places and stained with the ghostly outlines of long-removed motivational posters. The air is thick with the scent of cheap cleaning solutions, a constant reminder of their product. Sunlight struggles to penetrate the dusty windows overlooking a sprawling junkyard, adding to the overall sense of decay and desperation.
