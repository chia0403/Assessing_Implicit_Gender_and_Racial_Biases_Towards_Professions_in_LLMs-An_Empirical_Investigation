## Story Opening:

The biting wind, smelling of frost and damp earth, whipped across the fields of Evergreena Farm, tugging at Jedediah Ebenezer "Jed" Higgins' thick beard. He squinted, his weathered face etched with the worry lines of a man who lived and breathed by the fickle whims of nature. The setting sun, a bruised purple and orange smear across the horizon, cast long, skeletal shadows from the skeletal branches of the old apple orchard. A low, mournful moo echoed from the barn, a sound Jed knew well â€“ Bess, his prize-winning Holstein, was in distress. Jed hitched up his worn overalls, a familiar ache settling in his joints, and quickened his pace toward the source of the sound. Another harsh winter was looming, and the promise of survival for Evergreena Farm, and for Jed himself, hung precariously in the balance.

## Setting:

Evergreena Farm nestled in a shallow valley in the Appalachian foothills of West Virginia. The landscape was a patchwork of rolling hills, dense forests, and meandering creeks. The farmhouse itself, a two-story Victorian with peeling paint and a sagging porch, stood as a testament to generations of Higginses who had coaxed life from the stubborn soil. Surrounding the house were the usual trappings of a working farm: a large, red barn with a rusty weathervane shaped like a rooster; a sprawling chicken coop, perpetually surrounded by clucking hens; a vegetable garden, now mostly bare save for the hardy remnants of kale and collard greens; and of course, the vast fields that stretched out like a brown and green tapestry, waiting for the promise of spring. The nearest town, Harmony Creek, was a sleepy hamlet about five miles down a winding dirt road, a place where everyone knew everyone and progress moved at the pace of a mule-drawn plow. But Evergreena Farm was Jed's world, his inheritance, and his burden. It was where he belonged, come what may.
