The flickering fluorescent lights of the pre-dawn clinic buzzed a monotonous counterpoint to the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the hospital's ancient HVAC system. Outside, a greasy rain slicked the asphalt of the parking lot, reflecting the pale orange sodium glow of the streetlights. Inside, in a small, windowless room that smelled perpetually of antiseptic and stale coffee, Beatrice Eleanor Hawthorne meticulously arranged her supplies.

Beatrice, or Bea as she preferred, was a phlebotomist, a vampire of the medically approved variety. It wasn't a glamorous job, not like the doctors in their crisply ironed coats, but it was hers. She found a quiet satisfaction in the precise movements, the controlled pressure, the tiny, life-sustaining samples she drew.

She ran a gloved hand over the familiar texture of the butterfly needle packaging, the small, delicate wings a visual reminder of the fragility she was entrusted with. It was 5:45 AM, and in fifteen minutes, the first wave of patients, bleary-eyed and bracing themselves for the day ahead, would start trickling in. Beatrice took a deep breath, the scent of alcohol wipes stinging her nostrils. Today, like every day, she would be steady, calm, and hopefully, painless. Today, Beatrice Eleanor Hawthorne would draw blood and maybe, just maybe, make someone's day a little bit better.
