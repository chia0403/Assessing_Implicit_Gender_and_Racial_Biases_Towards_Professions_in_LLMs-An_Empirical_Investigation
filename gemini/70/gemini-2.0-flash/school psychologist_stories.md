## Story Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

The smell of stale coffee and simmering anxiety hung thick in the air of Mrs. Higgins' office, a potent blend that Amelia Jane Hawthorne knew all too well. She could practically taste it, a metallic tang on the back of her tongue, a side effect of a job that required her to constantly absorb other people's worries. Today, the worry was palpable, radiating off Mrs. Higgins like heat from a furnace. Amelia straightened her floral-printed skirt, smoothed her already-perfected bun, and forced a reassuring smile. "Good morning, Bethany," she said, her voice deliberately calm and steady. "Ready to talk about Liam?"

**Setting:**

The story unfolds in the unassuming town of Havenwood, nestled in the rolling hills of upstate New York. Havenwood Elementary School, a sprawling brick building built in the 1950s, is the heart of the community. Its linoleum floors, faded motivational posters, and the constant hum of fluorescent lights are both comforting and oppressive to Amelia. Her office, a small, windowless space tucked away near the nurse's station, is her sanctuary. She's tried to personalize it with colorful artwork donated by students, a calming lavender scent diffuser, and a carefully curated collection of books on child psychology. However, no amount of personal touch can completely mask the institutional feel, a constant reminder of the challenges she faces every day: the overcrowded classrooms, the underfunded programs, and the increasingly complex emotional needs of the students. Outside, the vibrant green of the surrounding hills offers a stark contrast to the institutional grey inside, a quiet promise of respite that Amelia often longs for, especially on days like this.
