## Story Opening and Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The scent of Earl Grey hung heavy in the air, a valiant but ultimately losing battle against the underlying aroma of antiseptic and quiet desperation. Dr. Eleanor Beatrice Davies pinched the bridge of her nose, the subtle ache a familiar companion after a long afternoon of listening. She knew, intellectually, that she was helping people, guiding them through the labyrinthine corridors of their minds. But today, the weight of their burdens felt heavier than usual, a sticky, inescapable residue. A gentle chime from her computer announced the arrival of her last client, and Eleanor straightened, forcing a smile that felt brittle as spun sugar. "Showtime," she murmured to the empty room, then clicked the 'Accept' button on the screen.

**Setting:**

Eleanor's private practice, "The Willow Tree Counseling Center," occupied a renovated Victorian house on a quiet, tree-lined street in the affluent suburb of Oakwood Heights, just outside of Portland, Oregon. The house, painted a calming shade of sage green with crisp white trim, was meant to evoke a sense of serenity and stability, a haven from the storms of life. Inside, Eleanor had painstakingly curated a space that felt both professional and welcoming. The waiting room was bathed in soft, natural light streaming through sheer curtains, with comfortable armchairs upholstered in muted floral patterns and a small table laden with current magazines and a steaming pot of herbal tea. Her office, however, was her sanctuary. It was smaller, more intimate, with walls lined with bookshelves filled with both professional texts and well-loved novels. A large, comfortable armchair sat opposite a worn, but sturdy oak desk, which was meticulously organized save for a small, framed photograph of Eleanor and her late grandmother, Beatrice, standing beneath a sprawling willow tree on the Oregon coast â€“ the very tree that inspired the name of her practice. The room was designed to be a safe space, a place where vulnerability could be nurtured and healing could begin. But even in this sanctuary, Eleanor sometimes felt the shadows of her clients' pain creeping in, clinging to the walls like silent vines.
