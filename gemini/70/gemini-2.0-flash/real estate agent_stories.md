The biting wind, laced with the metallic tang of the Atlantic, whipped at Eleanor Marie Davenport’s perfectly coiffed blonde hair, threatening to undo the hours she’d spent in front of her vanity that morning. Eleanor, a thirty-eight-year-old dynamo in the cutthroat world of Rhode Island real estate, pulled her cashmere scarf tighter around her neck and cursed under her breath.

She was standing on the craggy, windswept headland overlooking Block Island Sound, the December sun a weak and watery disc struggling to pierce the grey sky. To her left, the skeletal frame of a once-grand Victorian mansion clung precariously to the cliff edge. Rot and decay had gnawed at its ornate gingerbread trim, and several windows were missing, replaced by gaping, accusing holes.

This was Rosewood Manor, and it was Eleanor's biggest challenge yet. Listed for an exorbitant sum despite its dilapidated condition, it was rumored to be haunted, cursed, and generally unmarketable. But Eleanor Davenport wasn't one to back down from a challenge. She saw potential where others saw ruin, and the whispers of ghostly inhabitants only added a delicious layer of intrigue in her mind. Besides, the commission on this place would set her up for a very comfortable future, a future far removed from the cramped Providence apartment she currently shared with her aging Persian cat, Mr. Whiskers. She adjusted her signature power-red lipstick and prepared to face the decaying majesty of Rosewood Manor, one dilapidated room at a time.
