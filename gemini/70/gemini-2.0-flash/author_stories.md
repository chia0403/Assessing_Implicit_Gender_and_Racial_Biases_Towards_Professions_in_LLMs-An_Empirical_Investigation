## Story Opening:

The clatter of rain against the bay window was almost deafening, a relentless drumbeat that mirrored the frantic rhythm pounding in Alistair Finch's chest. He pushed a hand through his already dishevelled hair, the damp strands clinging to his forehead like anxious tendrils. Another dead end. Another crumpled page added to the growing mountain of discarded drafts that littered the floor around his writing desk.

He glared at the blinking cursor on the laptop screen, a malevolent little insect mocking his creative drought. Alistair Finch, bestselling author of the critically acclaimed "Shadows of Prague" and the wildly popular "The Cartographer's Curse," was officially stuck. His editor, a woman whose patience was thinner than the pages of a pulp novel, was due to call any minute demanding a synopsis, and Alistair had nothing. Absolutely nothing. Just the relentless rain and the gnawing feeling that his muse had abandoned him somewhere between the Yorkshire Moors and the bottom of a very strong bottle of single malt.

He needed inspiration. He needed a miracle. And preferably, a decent cup of tea.

## Setting:

Alistair Finch's study occupied the entire top floor of a converted lighthouse nestled on the rugged Cornish coast. Perched precariously on a cliff overlooking the turbulent Atlantic, the lighthouse, now painted a cheerful buttercup yellow, had been his sanctuary for the past five years. The walls were lined with bookshelves overflowing with dog-eared classics, obscure travelogues, and dusty volumes on folklore and mythology. A large, antique writing desk, cluttered with notes, maps, and various intriguing artifacts collected during his travels, sat beneath the bay window, offering a panoramic view of the sea. The room smelled of old paper, beeswax polish, and the salty tang of the ocean air. Outside, the wind howled a mournful song, a constant reminder of the untamed beauty and inherent dangers of the Cornish coastline.
