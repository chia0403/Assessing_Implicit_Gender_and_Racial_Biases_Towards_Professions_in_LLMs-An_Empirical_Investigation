## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The biting November wind whipped off Lake Michigan, swirling leaves and spitting flakes of early snow against the tall, art-deco windows of the Marquette Building in downtown Chicago. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of stale coffee and the nervous energy of a hundred hustling professionals.

**Story Opening:**

Dr. Vivian Eleanor Thorne, her auburn hair pulled back in a severe but undeniably flattering bun, stared out at the churning grey expanse of the lake. The view, usually a source of calming inspiration, did little to soothe her frayed nerves this morning. Her office, a minimalist haven of calming blue and natural wood, suddenly felt like a cage. The scent of the organic lemon balm tea she’d brewed felt cloying.

She chewed on the end of her pen, the metallic tang a grim reminder of the weight of her upcoming appointment. Mr. Cornelius "Corn" Kensington, CEO of Kensington Sweets and veritable overlord of the nation’s sugar cravings, was due in ten minutes. He was here, purportedly, for a nutritional overhaul. Vivian suspected, however, that he was more interested in buying her silence than her expertise.
