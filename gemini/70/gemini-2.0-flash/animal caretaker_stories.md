## Story Opening:

The screech of metal against metal was a familiar morning alarm for Elara Maeve O'Connell. It wasn't as gentle as the dawn chorus filtering through the thick glass of the rainforest aviary, nor as insistent as the bellowing of the hippopotamus needing his morning scrub, but the clang of the loading gate for the delivery truck always signaled the start of another day. Elara sighed, the scent of damp earth and exotic blooms already clinging to her worn khaki uniform. Another shipment of primate chow, judging by the label. Wonderful. She'd been hoping for a fresh delivery of mangoes for little Pablo, the spider monkey who'd been boycotting his breakfast ever since the batch had gone prematurely mushy.

## Setting:

Elara Maeve O'Connell works at the **"Edenwild Exotic Animal Sanctuary,"** a sprawling, privately-funded haven nestled deep within the misty foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. Edenwild is no ordinary zoo. It's dedicated to rescuing and rehabilitating exotic animals that have been displaced, injured, or confiscated from illegal pet trades. The Sanctuary is divided into meticulously recreated habitats, from the humid, simulated rainforest that houses its primate population and colourful bird species, to the arid, rocky enclosure for the rescued desert foxes and sun bears. There's a sprawling, muddy pond for the hippos, carefully monitored to ensure their health and contentment, and even a temperature-controlled arctic tundra for a lone, melancholic polar bear named Lumi, rescued from a struggling circus. The air is thick with the sounds and smells of the wild, a symphony of chirps, roars, and the occasional frustrated squawk, all interwoven with the scent of fertile soil and the faint, lingering aroma of disinfectant. Edenwild, despite its artificial construction, is a haven of wildness in the heart of the eastern United States.
