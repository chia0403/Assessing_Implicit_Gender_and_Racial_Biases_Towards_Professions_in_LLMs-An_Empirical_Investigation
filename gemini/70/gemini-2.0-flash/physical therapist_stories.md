## Story Opening:

The sharp tang of disinfectant hung in the air, a smell that had become as familiar to Eleanor Beatrice Finch as the feel of muscle and bone beneath her fingertips. It was a Tuesday morning at the Willow Creek Rehabilitation Center, and Eleanor was already running late. Not from sloth, mind you. Late because Mrs. Higgins, bless her cotton socks and arthritic knees, had needed an extra five minutes this morning to recount the scandalous details of her neighbour's marital strife. Eleanor, with her inherent need to soothe and understand, had listened patiently, knowing that sometimes a sympathetic ear was as crucial to recovery as any targeted exercise.

Now, however, she was paying the price. Mr. Henderson, the retired accountant with the fused vertebrae, was already glowering at her from the treatment table, his newspaper clenched in a fist that resembled a gnarled root. Eleanor took a deep breath, plastered on her most reassuring smile, and hurried towards him. "Good morning, Mr. Henderson! My apologies for the delay. How are we feeling today?"

## Setting:

The Willow Creek Rehabilitation Center was nestled on the outskirts of the small, picturesque town of Havenwood, Pennsylvania. The building itself was a sprawling, single-story structure built in the mid-70s, its exterior a drab beige brick punctuated by large, institutional windows. Inside, however, Eleanor and her colleagues had attempted to brighten the space. The waiting room boasted a cheerful mural depicting local landmarks â€“ the covered bridge, the town square, the rolling hills that surrounded Havenwood. Posters advertising upcoming community events adorned the walls, alongside inspirational quotes about healing and resilience.

The physical therapy room, where Eleanor spent the majority of her day, was a large, open space divided into several zones. There were treatment tables covered in crisp, white paper; a mirrored wall used for gait training; a weight room with various machines designed to rebuild strength; and a small, private office for consultations and paperwork. Sunlight streamed in through the large windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and casting long shadows across the floor. While the equipment was functional, and the staff dedicated, the whole place held a slightly faded air, a testament to the limited budget and the ever-present need for upgrades. It was a place of quiet suffering and slow, painstaking progress, where Eleanor Beatrice Finch poured her heart and soul into helping others rebuild their lives, one painful movement at a time.
