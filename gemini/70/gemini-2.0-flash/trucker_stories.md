The radio spat static and a tinny rendition of "Convoy," a song Barry knew he hated but also, paradoxically, found comforting on nights like this. Outside, the Wyoming wind, a banshee whistling through the gaps in his rig, threatened to lift the eighteen-wheeler right off the blacktop. Barry "Big Rig" Richardson gripped the steering wheel a little tighter, his knuckles white against the cracked leather. He'd been running this stretch of I-80 between Cheyenne and Laramie for the last six hours, the endless expanse of rolling plains stretching out on either side like a wrinkled, charcoal-grey sea.

The inside of his cab, christened "The Wanderer" and plastered with stickers from every state he'd ever hauled through, was a testament to a life lived on the road. A half-empty can of lukewarm coffee sat precariously on the dashboard, next to a well-worn copy of "Moby Dick" - Barry had a soft spot for literature, a secret he kept carefully hidden under his gruff exterior. A string of rosary beads, a gift from his late grandmother, swung gently from the rearview mirror, catching the faint glow of the dashboard lights. He'd seen some things on these highways, things that made a man clutch at faith, however frayed it might be. And tonight, with the wind screaming like a lost soul and the miles stretching endlessly before him, Barry had a feeling this night might be one of them.
