The rain was a furious, drumming thing against the corrugated iron roof of the Sunshine Palms Mobile Home Park office. Inside, beneath the flickering fluorescent lights, Penelope Anastasia Higgins tapped a frantic rhythm on her stapler, a nervous counterpoint to the storm raging outside. Sunshine Palms was located just off Highway 17, about halfway between Myrtle Beach and Charleston, a haven for retirees on fixed incomes and young families struggling to make ends meet. It was the kind of place where everyone knew everyoneâ€™s business, and where legal disputes rarely involved complex corporate law. More often, it was boundary disputes over rose bushes, accusations of noisy lawnmowers, or the occasional spat with a neighbor's overly enthusiastic chihuahua. As the only paralegal within a fifty-mile radius offering affordable services, Penelope had inadvertently become the community's de facto lawyer, counselor, and peacemaker. And today, the peace was threatening to shatter like a cheap wine glass.
