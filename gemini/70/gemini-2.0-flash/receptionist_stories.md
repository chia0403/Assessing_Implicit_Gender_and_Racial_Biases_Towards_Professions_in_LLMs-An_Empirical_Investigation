## The Story Opening:

The ring of the antique telephone sliced through the sterile silence of the lobby like a rusty saw. Evelyn Mae Thornton sighed, the sound barely audible above the low hum of the climate control, and reached for the receiver. "Thornton & Davies, good morning," she said, her voice impeccably polite, despite the fact she’d already answered eight calls this morning, all from angry clients wanting to know why their tax returns hadn’t been finalized yet.

"Yes, just a moment, please," she continued, automatically smoothing a stray strand of auburn hair that had escaped her severe bun. “I’ll connect you.” As she transferred the call to Mr. Davies’ assistant, a prickling sensation crawled up her spine. It was a feeling she knew well – the uneasy premonition of something… off. She glanced around the lobby, her eyes scanning the polished marble floor, the austere modernist furniture, and the framed photographs of meticulously manicured gardens (Mr. Thornton’s passion, apparently). Everything appeared normal. Too normal.

Then, she saw it.

A single, perfectly formed crimson rose lay on the glass coffee table, nestled amongst the architectural magazines. Roses were strictly forbidden. Mr. Thornton detested them, claiming their thorns represented the inherent deception of the natural world. Evelyn was certain she hadn’t put it there. And, perhaps more disturbingly, a faint scent of something sweet and unfamiliar hung in the air, something that wasn't the usual antiseptic cleaner and stale coffee.

This was not going to be a good day.

## The Setting:

The story takes place in the impeccably designed but somewhat sterile lobby of Thornton & Davies, a prestigious accounting firm located in a newly renovated office building in the financial district of **downtown Chicago**.

The lobby itself is a study in minimalist elegance. White marble floors gleam under the harsh fluorescent lights, softened by the subtle glow of recessed lighting in the ceiling. Modernist furniture, upholstered in shades of gray and charcoal, offers minimal comfort. Large, abstract paintings adorn the walls, their cool, geometric shapes reflecting the firm's image of precision and order.

The receptionist desk, a curved expanse of lacquered wood, dominates one side of the room. Behind it, a wall of tinted glass offers a partial view of the bustling office beyond, hinting at the hive of activity within.

The overall feeling is one of controlled power and detached professionalism, a place where money is managed, and emotions are suppressed. It's a space that reflects the personalities of the two founding partners: meticulous, pragmatic, and utterly devoid of warmth.
