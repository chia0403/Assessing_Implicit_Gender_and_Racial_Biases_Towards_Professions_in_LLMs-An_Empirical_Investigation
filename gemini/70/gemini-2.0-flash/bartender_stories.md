The rhythmic thump of techno music vibrated through Elias Thorne's chest, a familiar heartbeat in the dimly lit cavern that was The Obsidian Lounge. Smoke, a cocktail of patchouli and illicit substances, hung heavy in the air, clinging to the velvet drapes that lined the walls. Mirrors, strategically placed, reflected the neon glow of the bar, multiplying the faces of the beautiful and the damned. Elias, his dark hair slicked back and a perpetual weariness etched around his blue eyes, surveyed his domain, a polished mahogany island in a sea of hedonism. Tonight, like most nights, The Obsidian Lounge felt less like a bar and more like a purgatory for the rich and restless, and Elias Thorne, with his encyclopedic knowledge of liquor and a knack for listening without judgment, was their reluctant ferryman. He polished a glass, the clinking a tiny rebellion against the thumping bass, and waited for the next soul in need of absolution, or at least, a well-made martini.
