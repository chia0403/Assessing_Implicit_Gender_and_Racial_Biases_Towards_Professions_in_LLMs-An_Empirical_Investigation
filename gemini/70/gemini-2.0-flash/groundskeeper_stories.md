Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a groundskeeper:

**Setting:**

The story opens at Havenwood Estate, a sprawling, gothic-revival mansion perched precariously on the cliffs overlooking the churning grey waters of the North Sea. Havenwood isn't just a house; it's a landmark, its shadowed turrets and gargoyle-laden roof silhouetted against the perpetually stormy sky. The grounds are equally imposing: a meticulously kept (or *attempted* to be kept) series of formal gardens, gnarled and windswept hedgerows, a whispering pine forest clinging to the cliff edge, and a crumbling Victorian greenhouse overgrown with ivy and forgotten blooms. The air is thick with the scent of salt, damp earth, and the faint, lingering aroma of sea roses. The year is 1928, and Havenwood is shrouded in an almost palpable sense of decay and unspoken history.

**Story Opening:**

The chill wind whipped around Albert Finch’s weathered face as he wrestled with a recalcitrant rose bush, its thorns snagging on his patched tweed jacket like tiny, spiteful claws. Albert Finch, Groundsman of Havenwood Estate for the past twenty years, muttered a string of colourful oaths under his breath that would have made a sailor blush. He'd been battling these blasted Gertrude Jekyll roses for weeks, trying to coax a bit of life back into their neglected stems. The new Lady Havenwood, a striking woman with eyes like chips of obsidian and a manner as cold as the North Sea wind, had taken a sudden, almost obsessive, interest in the rose garden. "They must bloom, Finch," she'd declared, her voice as sharp as a shard of glass. "I expect them to bloom." And Lady Havenwood, Albert knew, did not suffer disappointment lightly.

He straightened, his aching back protesting with a chorus of pops and groans, and wiped his brow with the back of his gloved hand. The North Sea churned below, its waves crashing against the cliffs with a mournful roar. It was a lonely place, Havenwood, a place where secrets whispered on the wind and shadows danced in the corners of your eye. And lately, Albert had the unsettling feeling that he wasn't the only one listening. Something was amiss at Havenwood, something far more sinister than a failing rose garden. The air itself crackled with a tension that set his teeth on edge, and he couldn't shake the feeling that the very stones of the estate were holding their breath, waiting for something…or someone.
