**Opening:**

Professor Alistair Humphrey Cavendish, PhD, DPhil, FRAS, found himself staring into a teacup filled with what could generously be described as lukewarm, brownish water. The reflection stared back: a man etched with worry lines that seemed to deepen with each passing year, a perpetually rumpled tweed jacket straining at the buttons, and eyes that held a haunted gleam, a consequence of years spent deciphering ancient languages and staring into the abyss of forgotten lore. He hadn't slept properly in weeks, not since the cryptic letter had arrived, its papyrus aged and brittle, its ink faded almost to nothing. The single symbol etched at the bottom had ignited a fire in his mind, a dangerous, obsessive flame that threatened to consume him.

**Setting:**

The year is 1931. The place is Oxford University, specifically the dusty, labyrinthine offices of the Classics Department. Alistair's office, Room 217, is a testament to a life lived amongst books. Shelves overflow with leather-bound volumes in Greek, Latin, hieroglyphs, and countless other dead languages. Maps, yellowed and cracked, adorn the walls, depicting lost cities and unexplored territories. The air hangs thick with the scent of old paper, pipe tobacco (Alistair's ever-present companion), and a faint, almost metallic tang that seems to emanate from a small, intricately carved box resting on his desk, the source of his sleepless nights. Rain lashes against the leaded glass windows, creating a melancholic soundtrack to his anxieties. Outside, the familiar gothic spires of the university rise against the grey sky, a constant reminder of the weight of history, and the secrets it holds.
