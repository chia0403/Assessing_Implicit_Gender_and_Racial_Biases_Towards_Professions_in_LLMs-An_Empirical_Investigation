The grand lobby of the Hotel Argentum hummed with a quiet, almost expectant energy. Gilded cherubs, perched precariously on the cornices, seemed to watch the revolving doors with detached amusement, their painted smiles unchanging as chauffeurs, socialites, and weary travelers flowed through. The air, thick with the scent of lilies and old money, clung to the velvet ropes and burnished brass fittings. Sunlight, filtered through stained-glass windows depicting scenes of Roman emperors and mythical beasts, cast long, jewel-toned shadows across the marble floor.

Amidst this opulent tableau, **Clarence Bartholomew Finch**, a bellhop whose uniform was a tad too tight around the middle and whose optimism always seemed to be perpetually a beat behind reality, bustled with the determined efficiency of a small but dedicated tugboat. He straightened his cap, adjusted his tie, and scanned the crowd, ever alert for the tell-tale signs of a newly arrived guest in need of assistance: the bewildered expression, the oversized luggage, the air of hesitant expectation. Clarence believed in making an impression, even a small one. He just hoped, for once, it would be the right kind.
