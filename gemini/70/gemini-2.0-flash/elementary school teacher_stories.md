The air in Mrs. Evelyn Amelia Birchwood's third-grade classroom hung thick with the scent of construction paper and simmering anxiety. It was Friday, late afternoon, the kind of day that stretched on forever, punctuated only by the rhythmic tick-tock of the old classroom clock and the muffled sounds of the janitor's vacuum in the hallway. Outside, a November drizzle slicked the asphalt playground of Willow Creek Elementary, painting the world in shades of gray. Inside, the world was a riot of vibrant, albeit slightly wonky, hand-turkey artwork, each meticulously crafted by Evelyn’s twenty-two students. Their small, hopeful eyes flickered between their creations and the clock, anticipation palpable in the humid air. Today was the day they’d be taking their turkeys home, treasures crafted with love and glitter glue, to display proudly on their family’s refrigerators. But today was also the day Evelyn had to deliver the news. The news about the school's annual Thanksgiving pageant. And that news wasn't good.
