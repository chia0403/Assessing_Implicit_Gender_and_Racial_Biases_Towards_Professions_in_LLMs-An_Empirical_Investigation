## Story Opening and Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The squeak of rubber soles on linoleum was the soundtrack to Elara Vance's Thursday morning. She hated it, this incessant, high-pitched screeching that seemed to amplify the anxiety humming beneath her own skin. But it was unavoidable in the Occupational Therapy wing of St. Jude's Rehabilitation Center. Elara took a deep breath, the sterilized air doing little to calm her nerves, and pasted on her most reassuring smile. Today was a big day for Mr. Henderson, and she needed to be a beacon of positivity, not a stressed-out Occupational Therapist on the verge of a caffeine-induced meltdown.

**Setting:**

The story unfolds within the walls of St. Jude's Rehabilitation Center, a sprawling, four-story building situated on the outskirts of the bustling city of Boston. Built in the late 1980s, the center has a dated, institutional feel. Think beige walls, fluorescent lighting that flickers intermittently, and the pervasive scent of disinfectant mixed with lukewarm coffee. The Occupational Therapy wing, where Elara spends most of her time, is a dedicated space equipped with a range of adaptive equipment: parallel bars, therapy putty, weighted utensils, and various contraptions designed to help patients regain lost skills. There are individual treatment rooms, a communal kitchen where patients can practice daily living tasks, and a small garden area used for therapeutic activities like gardening and nature walks. The atmosphere is a blend of hope and exhaustion, where victories are hard-earned and setbacks are a constant possibility. Sunlight streams through the large windows in the afternoon, offering a small reprieve from the sterile environment, a reminder of the world outside where life, in all its complexity, continues.
