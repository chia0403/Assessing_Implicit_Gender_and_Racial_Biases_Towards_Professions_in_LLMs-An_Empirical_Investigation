The acrid smell of hairspray hung thick in the air, a perfumed smog that only Beatrice "Bea" Bellweather seemed to find comforting. She hummed along to the tinny 80s power ballad leaking from the salon speakers as she expertly foiled a client's long, dark waves. Sunlight streamed through the large, paned windows of "Shear Bliss," her salon nestled on the quaint, cobbled street of Havenwood, Vermont. 

Havenwood was the kind of place where everyone knew everyone, and where Bea's skill with a pair of scissors was legendary. The town was a postcard of New England charm â€“ white clapboard houses with manicured lawns, a maple tree-lined main street dotted with antique shops and bakeries, and a sense of tranquility that wrapped around you like a warm, wool blanket. But beneath the surface of this picturesque facade, secrets simmered, whispered between the regulars in Bea's chair, carried on the breeze like the faint scent of fallen leaves. And Bea, with her quick hands and even quicker wit, was privy to more of them than most.
