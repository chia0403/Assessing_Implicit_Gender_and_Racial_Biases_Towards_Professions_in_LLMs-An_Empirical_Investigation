## Story Opening:

The persistent, almost mocking, chirping of the smoke detector was the first thing Arthur Percival Plimpton registered upon regaining consciousness. He blinked, wincing. The smoke stung his eyes and a dull throbbing pulsed behind his temples, a percussion section practicing inside his skull. He tried to sit up, but a sharp pain lanced through his shoulder, making him gasp and sink back against the surprisingly soft rug.

Arthur coughed, the acrid tang of burnt something-or-other filling his lungs. Through the swirling gray haze, he could just make out the flickering orange glow emanating from theâ€¦ kitchen? Oh dear.

## Setting:

Arthur Percival Plimpton's flat was what one might charitably call "compact." Located above a laundromat on the quieter (read: less desirable) end of Bleak Street, it comprised a single room divided haphazardly into a sleeping area, a minuscule living space, and a kitchenette that now appeared to be actively trying to self-destruct. The decor was a testament to Arthur's pragmatic, yet slightly tragic, aesthetic. A mismatched collection of hand-me-down furniture coexisted with meticulously organized stacks of insurance brochures and policy documents. A half-finished cross-stitch depicting a serene seascape lay abandoned on a nearby table, a silent indictment of his limited free time. Outside, the incessant hum of the laundromat's dryers provided a constant, low-grade background noise, a soundtrack to Arthur's mundane but, until now, largely uneventful life.
