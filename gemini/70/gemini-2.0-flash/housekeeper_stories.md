## Story Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

The aroma of lemon polish hung thick in the air, stinging the nostrils despite twenty years of near-constant exposure. Evangeline Marguerite Dubois, knees protesting with a familiar twinge, buffed the mahogany sideboard for what felt like the hundredth time that morning. Dust, a relentless enemy in this opulent tomb, continued to settle, a fine grey film mocking her efforts. Outside, the first tentative fingers of dawn stretched across the manicured lawns of Blackwood Manor, painting the dew-kissed grass in shades of pearl and jade. Inside, however, the house remained steeped in a lingering darkness, a darkness that clung to the heavy velvet curtains and the shadowed corners like a stubborn, silent ghost.

Evangeline sighed, her breath misting slightly in the chill of the unheated dining room. This wasn't just dust, she knew. This house held secrets, secrets that settled deeper than the grime on the antique furniture, secrets that whispered in the creak of the floorboards and echoed in the vast, empty halls. And for twenty years, Evangeline had been the one to silently listen.

**Setting:**

Blackwood Manor, a sprawling Gothic Revival estate perched atop a windswept bluff overlooking the Atlantic Ocean in Newport, Rhode Island. The house, built in the late 1800s, boasts intricate stonework, soaring turrets, and vast windows that offer breathtaking, yet often foreboding, views of the churning sea. Inside, the manor is a labyrinth of grand ballrooms, echoing hallways lined with ancestral portraits, and dimly lit studies filled with leather-bound books and forgotten artifacts. The decor is a testament to a bygone era, opulent and imposing, with heavy furniture, rich fabrics, and ornate details that speak of wealth and power.

The year is 1953. The house is owned by the reclusive and eccentric Mr. Alistair Blackwood, a man rarely seen and even more rarely understood. Aside from Mr. Blackwood and Evangeline, the staff is minimal, consisting of a taciturn gardener named Silas and a cook, Mrs. Higgins, a woman as round and comforting as her apple pies, who has been with the Blackwood family for even longer than Evangeline. The remoteness of the estate and the eccentricities of its inhabitants lend Blackwood Manor an atmosphere of isolation, mystery, and a pervasive sense of somethingâ€¦ amiss.
