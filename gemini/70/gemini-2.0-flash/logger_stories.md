Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a main character who's a logger:

**Setting:** The Clatsop State Forest, Oregon, late October. Mist clung to the moss-draped Sitka spruce like a ghostly shroud, muting the sounds of the forest to a damp hush. The air hung thick with the scent of decaying leaves and freshly cut cedar, a smell that was both comforting and unsettlingly metallic. Heavy rain had fallen the previous night, leaving the logging roads slick and treacherous, the ground sodden underfoot. The late afternoon sun, a weak and watery thing, barely pierced the canopy, painting the forest floor in shades of gray and green.

**Opening:**

The chainsaw snarled to a halt, its angry whine abruptly silenced. Silas Bartholomew Blackwood, his face streaked with grime and sweat despite the chilly air, wiped a gloved hand across his brow. He spat a wad of chewing tobacco into the tangled undergrowth and straightened his aching back, the leather of his suspenders groaning in protest. Another day, another giant felled. He’d been chasing timber in these woods since he was knee-high to a stump, and still, the size of these old-growth trees never ceased to inspire a grudging respect, even as he brought them crashing to the earth. Silas took a swig of water from his battered thermos, the lukewarm liquid doing little to alleviate the bone-deep chill that had settled into him. He surveyed the fallen behemoth, a Douglas fir that had likely been standing for centuries, its exposed rings a testament to lives lived long before his own. A flash of something dark caught his eye near the trunk. He squinted, a prickle of unease crawling up his spine. It wasn't an animal; he knew the furtive movements of the local deer and the bold swagger of the raccoons. No, this was something else entirely, something… deliberate. He picked up his axe, the familiar weight a comforting presence in his hand, and moved forward, the silence of the forest suddenly feeling less peaceful and more… waiting.
