## Story Opening

The fluorescent lights of "TaxBe Gone!" hummed a weary tune, mirroring the low-grade anxiety throbbing in Archibald Finch's temples. Archibald, a man whose life revolved around W-2s, 1099s, and the occasional Schedule C, sighed, the sound lost in the rustle of receipts piled precariously on his desk. Rain hammered against the grimy window, turning the late afternoon into a premature twilight. He rubbed his eyes, the faint scent of copier toner clinging to his fingertips. Tonight, he was determined to finish the dreaded Klugman account – a labyrinthine mess of questionable deductions and aggressive tax avoidance strategies that had been giving him sleepless nights for weeks. Just then, the bell above the door jingled, announcing a new arrival, and Archibald braced himself for another evening of dissecting other people's financial lives. 

## Setting

Archibald Finch's "TaxBe Gone!" office occupied a ground-floor space in a nondescript brick building on the edge of downtown Millwood. It was the kind of place where practicality trumped aesthetics. The walls were a faded beige, punctuated by motivational posters featuring stock photos of smiling families and the inspiring slogan, "Making Taxes Less Taxing!" The furniture was strictly utilitarian – a sturdy metal desk piled high with paperwork, a swivel chair that groaned in protest with every movement, and two mismatched chairs for clients. A beat-up filing cabinet stood sentinel in the corner, its drawers overflowing with manila folders. The only splash of color came from a wilting spider plant perched precariously on a windowsill, valiantly clinging to life despite Archibald's forgetfulness when it came to watering. The overall impression was one of organized chaos, a reflection of the complex and often frustrating world of income taxes. Outside, the relentless rain and the grimy city streets provided a stark contrast to the sterile, albeit predictable, environment within.
