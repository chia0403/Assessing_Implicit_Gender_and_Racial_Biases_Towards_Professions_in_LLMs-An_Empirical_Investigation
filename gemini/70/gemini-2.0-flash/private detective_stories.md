The rain lashed against the grimy windows of Archibald Finch’s office, each gust a miniature fist banging against the glass. Inside, the air hung thick with the mingled scents of stale cigarette smoke, cheap whiskey, and desperation – a potent cocktail Archibald knew intimately. Moonlight filtered weakly through the downpour, illuminating the dust motes dancing in the single beam cutting across the room. He sat slumped in his worn leather armchair, its springs groaning in protest with every shift, a half-empty glass of amber liquid clutched in his hand. The only other light came from the flickering neon sign outside his window, painting the words "Finch Investigations" in a sickly green glow across the opposite wall.

Archibald Finch, the proprietor of said investigations, wasn't having a good night, or a good week for that matter. Hell, he wasn’t having a good *year*. The year was 1948, and the setting: a forgotten corner of Chicago's Near North Side, a neighborhood clinging precariously to respectability while the shadows of organized crime stretched longer each day. His office, located above a struggling Chinese laundry and next to a perpetually closed pawn shop, perfectly mirrored his own fading fortunes. He was a relic in a city rapidly changing, a trench coat and fedora in a world that was slowly trading them for something newer, shinier, and less cynical. And, unfortunately, the rain seemed intent on mirroring *his* mood: relentless, dreary, and damn near impossible to ignore.
