The setting was the High Sierra Nevada foothills, specifically the sprawling, sun-baked acreage of the "Iron Creek Ranch" in California. Summer clung on with a stubborn grip, turning the grasslands a brittle gold and leaving a dust haze hanging in the air, thick enough to taste. The creek itself, usually a rushing torrent, was a mere trickle these days, barely enough to slake the thirst of the cattle.

The first sign of trouble, as it almost always was, came with the wind. A low, mournful whine that snaked through the canyons, carrying the scent of distant, burning pine. This wind, known locally as the "Devil's Breath," usually preceded a brush fire, and any rancher worth his salt knew to be vigilant when it howled.

Standing on the porch of the main house, a sturdy, clapboard structure that had weathered a century of storms, stood Caleb Jonathan Thorne. He was a man built from the same granite as the mountains that rose in the distance, weathered and etched with the sun and hardship. His hands, calloused and strong, rested on the worn railing. He squinted, his eyes, the color of a stormy sky, scanning the horizon. The scent of smoke was faint, almost imperceptible, but Caleb knew it was there. And where there was smoke, there was fire. And fire in these conditions was a death sentence to everything he held dear.
