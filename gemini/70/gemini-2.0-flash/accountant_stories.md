Rain lashed against the window of Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne's tiny, rent-controlled apartment in the Outer Sunset of San Francisco. It was the kind of rain that seeped into your bones, a grey, persistent dampness that mirrored the general feeling of being an accountant during tax season. Amelia huddled deeper into her threadbare, but beloved, armchair, a mug of lukewarm Earl Grey warming her perpetually cold hands. The apartment itself was a testament to her frugal nature: mismatched furniture scavenged from thrift stores, walls painted a slightly-off-white by a previous tenant, and a single, stubborn spider plant named Archibald that refused to thrive despite her best efforts. A stack of invoices, threatening to topple like a poorly built Jenga tower, teetered precariously on the small table beside her. Amelia was supposed to be reviewing the particularly dubious expenses of a pet grooming business ("Luxury Shih Tzu Hair Extensions," really?) but the rhythmic drumming of the rain against the glass was making it incredibly difficult to concentrate. Outside, the fog horns groaned, a mournful symphony that seemed to understand her quiet despair.
