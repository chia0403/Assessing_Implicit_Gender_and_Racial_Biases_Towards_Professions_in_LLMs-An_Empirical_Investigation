## Opening and Setting:

The hiss was a constant companion, a white noise hum that vibrated through Eleanor "Ellie" Rodriguez's bones. It was the sound of potential, the static crackle promising distant voices, lost signals, and secrets riding the electromagnetic waves. Tonight, however, the hiss was more prominent than usual, a buzzing anxiety that mirrored the tremor in Ellie's hand as she adjusted the gain on the ancient Collins R-390A receiver.

The setting: A cramped, dimly lit shack perched precariously on the edge of a windswept cliff overlooking the Pacific Ocean. The shack, affectionately dubbed "The Lighthouse" by Ellie, was a patchwork of scavenged lumber and rusted corrugated iron, its single window a milky eye gazing out into the inky blackness. Inside, a chaotic orchestra of wires snaked across dusty tables, connecting vintage radios, oscilloscopes with flickering green screens, and a jungle of antennas that clawed at the stormy night sky. The air was thick with the scent of ozone, solder, and the ever-present salt spray that managed to seep through even the smallest cracks. This was Ellie's sanctuary, her workshop, her haven, and, tonight, the potential epicenter of something significant. A storm raged outside, mirroring the growing storm brewing inside her gut.
