Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a flight attendant named Eleanor Amelia Hayes:

**Story Opening:**

The metallic tang of coffee swirled around Eleanor Amelia Hayes, a smell she usually found comforting, but today, it only amplified the knot of anxiety twisting in her gut. She pressed her palms against the smooth counter of the galley, trying to steady the slight tremor in her hands. Outside, the pre-dawn sky bled from inky black to a bruised purple, mirroring her mood. Eleanor inhaled deeply, forcing a smile as First Officer Davies strode past, whistling a jaunty tune. “Ready for another adventure, Eleanor?” he boomed, completely oblivious to the internal turmoil raging beneath her carefully applied lipstick.

Eleanor forced a chuckle. "Always, Mr. Davies," she replied, the practiced words slipping out with automatic ease. "Just brewing up the perfect cup of jet fuel."

He winked and continued toward the cockpit, leaving Eleanor to stare out the tiny galley window at the sprawling expanse of Denver International Airport. Another flight, another city, another few hundred faces she would momentarily charm before disappearing back into the anonymity of the sky. But today felt different. Today, the routine felt… wrong.

**Setting:**

The setting is **Denver International Airport (DIA)**, specifically within the galley of a **Boeing 737-800** aircraft. The time is **5:45 AM, Mountain Standard Time**, on a cool, late October morning.

The galley is compact and efficient, a stainless steel haven of ovens, coffee makers, and storage compartments. The lighting is bright and sterile, designed for functionality rather than ambiance. The air is crisp and clean, a mix of recirculated air and the lingering aroma of cleaning solutions. Outside the small windows, the tarmac is a hive of activity, with baggage handlers maneuvering luggage carts, ground crew performing pre-flight checks, and other aircraft taxiing toward the runway. The vastness of the airport, a sprawling concrete landscape punctuated by the iconic peaked roof of the terminal, emphasizes the smallness and contained nature of the aircraft.
