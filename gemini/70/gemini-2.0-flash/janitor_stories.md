## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The gargantuan, echoing lobby of the Bradbury Building in downtown Los Angeles. It's late, pushing 1 AM, and the ornate ironwork that climbs towards the glass ceiling high above casts long, skeletal shadows across the marble floor. The air hangs thick with the scent of aged brass, lemon polish, and a faint, lingering perfume - the ghost of some glamorous past event.

**Opening:**

"Damn it all to blazes," muttered Edgar Bartholomew Finnigan, his breath fogging in the cool night air. He wrestled with the stubborn wheel of his industrial floor cleaner, its chrome plating gleaming under the dim, amber-hued sconces that lined the walls. Tonight, of all nights, it had decided to stage a mechanical rebellion, groaning and shuddering like a dying beast. Edgar yanked harder, his already reddened knuckles turning a shade whiter. He was a man built more for sweeping than engineering, his frame thick-set and his hands calloused from years of pushing brooms and scrubbing grime. He much preferred the rhythmic sway of the push broom, the quiet satisfaction of leaving a clean swath in his wake. This machine, this infernal contraption of gears and wires, was just another reminder that even in a place steeped in history and timeless beauty like the Bradbury, modernity found a way to muck things up. He gave the wheel one final, desperate heave. It responded with a high-pitched squeal, then locked solid. Edgar Bartholomew Finnigan sighed, a weary sound that echoed mournfully in the cavernous lobby. He was going to be here all night.
