Okay, here's a story opening and setting, featuring a main character who is a physician's assistant:

**Setting:** The small, brightly lit exam room, number three, in the Harmony Creek Family Medical Clinic. The walls are painted a soothing, yet slightly sterile, pale blue.  A framed print of a meadow filled with wildflowers hangs crookedly on the wall, the hook having likely been bumped one too many times. The air smells faintly of hand sanitizer and the lingering citrus scent of Mrs. Higgins’ air freshener, a scent that Dr. Miller secretly detests.  A worn, beige examination table dominates the room, covered in a crinkled, disposable paper sheet. Beside it, a rolling cart holds the essential instruments – a stethoscope, blood pressure cuff, otoscope, and a small, well-loved reflex hammer. Outside, a low hum of traffic and the occasional siren provide a constant, almost comforting, backdrop to the day’s routine.

**Opening:**

The metallic snap of the blood pressure cuff deflating seemed deafening in the sudden silence. Eleanor Grace Ainsworth, PA-C, scribbled the reading onto Mr. Henderson’s chart, a frown etching itself between her meticulously shaped eyebrows. 160/95. Not good. Not at all good. He'd sworn up and down he'd been sticking to his low-sodium diet, but Eleanor knew that song and dance better than the clinic’s crackling Muzak.  She met Mr. Henderson's watery blue eyes. "Mr. Henderson, are you *sure* about the diet? Maybe a little extra salt sneaked in somewhere?"  His face crumpled like a paper bag. He knew he’d been caught. But Eleanor Grace Ainsworth knew something else too. Mr. Henderson wasn't just cheating on his diet; there was a deep, almost unbearable sadness clinging to him, thick as the humidity in the July air. And Eleanor knew, with a sinking feeling, that his blood pressure was probably the least of his worries.
