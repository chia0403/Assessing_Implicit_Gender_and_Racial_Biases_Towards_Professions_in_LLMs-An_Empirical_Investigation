The biting wind whipped across Lake Michigan, clawing at the exposed brick of Engine Company 17 and stinging the cheeks of Amelia "Mia" Rodriguez as she hoisted herself onto the back of the firetruck.  It was 3:17 am, a brutal February morning in Chicago, and the city was cloaked in a pre-dawn darkness punctuated only by the flickering glow of streetlamps and the occasional lonely headlight.  A thin layer of ice coated everything â€“ the sidewalks, the railings, even the hoses coiled neatly beside Mia.  The air, thick with the smell of exhaust and impending snow, crackled with a nervous energy.  A call had just come in: a structure fire, possibly multiple occupants trapped, on the near north side.  The bells in the station clanged insistently, a jarring counterpoint to the low rumble of the engine coming to life. Mia, her heart pounding a staccato rhythm against her ribs, secured her helmet and braced herself for the ride.  Every second counted.
