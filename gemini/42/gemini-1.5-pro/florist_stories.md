The bell above the door of "Petal & Stem" jingled merrily, a sound Amelia Wren Cartwright usually found charming. Today, however, the cheerful chime grated on her nerves like a rusty swing set.  Rain lashed against the large shop windows, blurring the vibrant colours of the tulips and daffodils displayed outside.  Grey light seeped into the small, usually bright space, casting long shadows across the buckets of hydrangeas and roses that lined the walls. Cobble Lane, normally bustling with tourists and locals alike, was deserted.  Even Mrs. Higgins, the owner of the bakery across the street, hadn't opened her doors.  Amelia sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear, and adjusted the faded denim apron tied around her waist.  The scent of damp earth and lilies hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the tempest brewing outside.  This was not how she envisioned her Tuesday morning unfolding.
