The rhythmic clatter of the typewriter keys was the soundtrack to Beatrice Ophelia Higgins' life.  It punctuated the hushed stillness of the mahogany-paneled office, a space dominated by the scent of aged leather and Mr. Henderson's ever-present cigar smoke.  Rain lashed against the large, arched windows overlooking Bryant Park in Manhattan, the grey light of a late November afternoon filtering through the grimy glass. Beatrice, perched on the edge of her worn secretarial chair, her fingers flying across the keys, barely registered the storm.  She was too focused on transcribing the latest dictated memo, a dense and convoluted missive concerning the intricacies of  1950s interstate trucking regulations.  The only outward sign of her discomfort was the slight furrow between her perfectly sculpted eyebrows, a subtle indication of the brewing headache behind her cat-eye glasses.  This, after all, was just another Tuesday.
