The rusty clang of a shovel biting into the unforgiving Virginia clay echoed through the still morning air.  Dew clung to the emerald blades of grass, painting the sprawling lawn of the Hemlock House a deeper shade of green. Eliza Jane Hemmings, her name a quiet irony considering the lack of hemlock trees on the property, wiped a bead of sweat from her brow, the early October sun already hinting at a warm day. Her worn leather gloves were stained a rich, earthy brown, a testament to years spent coaxing life from the soil. Around her, the meticulously manicured gardens of the historic estate lay bathed in the golden light, a testament to her dedication and skill.  Hemlock House, a grand Victorian mansion with peeling paint and an air of faded glory, stood silent witness to Eliza Janeâ€™s labours, its empty windows like dark eyes observing her every move.  The air hummed with the promise of autumn, the scent of decaying leaves mingling with the sweet perfume of late-blooming roses, a bittersweet fragrance that mirrored the tangled secrets hidden within the house's walls and the grounds Eliza Jane tended with such care.
