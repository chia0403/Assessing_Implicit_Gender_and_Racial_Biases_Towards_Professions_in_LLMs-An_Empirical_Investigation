The insistent Glasgow drizzle seemed to seep into Eleanor Ainsworthâ€™s bones, a damp chill that no amount of wool could quite dispel.  She tucked a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear, the movement hampered by the thick scarf wrapped around her neck, and squinted at the brass plaque affixed to the stone building before her.  "The Thistle and Hearth Community Centre." It wasn't exactly the gleaming private clinic she'd envisioned for her practice, but Eleanor, a newly qualified dietician, wasn't in a position to be picky.  This converted Victorian church hall, with its slightly musty smell and mismatched chairs, was her starting point, her foothold in a city that felt both exhilaratingly new and dauntingly vast.  Inside, the faint clatter of teacups and the low hum of conversation hinted at the weekly "Healthy Habits" group Eleanor was about to address.  She took a deep breath, the cool Scottish air filling her lungs, and pushed open the heavy oak door. The warm, buttery scent of shortbread, a clear violation of her recommended dietary guidelines, hit her full force. This, she realised with a wry smile, was going to be an interesting challenge.
