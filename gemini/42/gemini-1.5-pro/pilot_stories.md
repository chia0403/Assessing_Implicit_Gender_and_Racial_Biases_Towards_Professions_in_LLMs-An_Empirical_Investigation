The biting Alaskan wind whipped at Amelia "Ace" Moreau's parka as she prepped her De Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver for takeoff.  The pre-dawn sky, a bruised purple bleeding into a hesitant orange, reflected off the icy crust of Lake Clark.  Spruce and pine trees, cloaked in a thick layer of snow, crowded the shoreline, their skeletal branches reaching out like gnarled fingers.  Ace tightened the straps of her leather aviator's helmet, the fur trim brushing against her cheek.  The air, crisp and clean, stung her lungs with every breath, a stark contrast to the stale, recycled air of the Anchorage hangar she’d left just hours ago. This was her element – the vast, unforgiving wilderness, where the only sounds were the drone of the plane’s engine and the mournful cry of the wind.  This morning's mission was a particularly challenging one: delivering vital medical supplies to a remote research outpost nestled deep within the jagged peaks of the Chigmit Mountains, a flight that would push both her and her trusty Beaver to their limits.
