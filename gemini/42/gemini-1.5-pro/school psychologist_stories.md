The sky, a bruised purple-grey, mirrored the heavy feeling in her chest.

Its once vibrant red paint was now faded and peeling, a visual testament to years of budget cuts and neglect.  The flickering fluorescent lights visible through the grimy windows cast a sickly yellow glow, adding to the overall sense of decay.  Eleanor took a deep breath, the sharp, pine-scented air doing little to dispel the knot of unease tightening in her stomach.  This morning's hastily called meeting with Principal Davies had a distinct air of urgency about it, and Eleanor knew, with a chilling certainty, that whatever waited for her inside those institutional walls would not be good.
