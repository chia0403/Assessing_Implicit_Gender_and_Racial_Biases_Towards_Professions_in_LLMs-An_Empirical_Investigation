The biting November wind whipped around Coach Amelia "Amy" Reyes as she surveyed the muddy, churned-up field.  Floodlights cast long, skeletal shadows from the lone, spindly oak tree at the far end, painting the scene in an eerie, almost gothic light.  St. Ignatius Preparatory Academy, nestled in the sleepy, fog-bound town of Hollow Creek, Oregon, wasn't exactly a football powerhouse.  In fact, the Ravens hadn't won a game in three seasons, a streak Amy was determined to break, even if it meant coaching a team composed mostly of poetry club rejects and aspiring thespians. The air smelled of damp earth and the faint, lingering aroma of burnt popcorn from the concession stand, a testament to the meager attendance at their last home game. Amy pulled her Ravens-branded windbreaker tighter, a shiver running down her spine that had nothing to do with the cold. This wasn't just about winning a game; it was about proving something, not just to the town, but to herself.
