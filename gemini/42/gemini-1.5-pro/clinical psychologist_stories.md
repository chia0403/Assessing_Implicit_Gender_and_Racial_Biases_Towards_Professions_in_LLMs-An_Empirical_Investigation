The room, nestled within a converted Victorian house on a quiet, tree-lined street in Ashworth, Massachusetts, usually exuded a calming atmosphere.

A faint scent of sandalwood from the diffuser Elias kept on his desk usually helped soothe anxious newcomers.  But tonight, even the comforting glow of the Tiffany lamp couldn't quite dispel the tension hanging heavy in the air.  Louisa Albright, her knuckles white against the worn leather of her handbag, stared fixedly at a point just beyond Elias's left shoulder.
