Rain lashed against the grimy window of Jack Hartigan's office, mimicking the relentless drumming in his head.  Neon signs from the street below reflected in the slick, black surface of his mahogany desk, painting flickering stripes across the faded Persian rug. Cigarette smoke, thick and stale, clung to the heavy velvet curtains and the stacks of case files threatening to topple over.  Jack Hartigan, Private Investigator, sat hunched in his worn leather chair, the weak bulb of a desk lamp illuminating the deep lines etched into his face. His office, nestled above a dusty bookstore on Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village, New York City, usually held a certain chaotic charm. Tonight, however, it felt less like a sanctuary and more like a concrete coffin. The year was 1958, and the city that never slept was whispering a lullaby of anxieties, a tune Jack knew all too well.
