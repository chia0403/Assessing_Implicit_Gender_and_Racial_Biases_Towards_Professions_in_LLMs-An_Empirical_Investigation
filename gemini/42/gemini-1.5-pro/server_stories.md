The flickering neon sign of the Starlight Diner cast a lurid, greasy glow over Amelia "Amy" Reyes as she wiped down the sticky Formica countertop.  Rain lashed against the large plate-glass windows, blurring the view of the desolate stretch of highway that snaked through the Nevada desert.  Inside, the only sounds were the rhythmic drip of a leaky faucet and the low hum of the ancient refrigerator.  It was 3:17 am, the slowest hour of Amy's graveyard shift, a time when even the truckers seemed to find somewhere else to be. The Starlight, a beacon of lukewarm coffee and questionable chili, was her kingdom for these eight hours, a realm of cracked vinyl booths, perpetually stained coffee mugs, and the lingering scent of frying onions.  Tonight, however, the silence felt heavier than usual, pregnant with a quiet anticipation that prickled at the back of Amy's neck.
