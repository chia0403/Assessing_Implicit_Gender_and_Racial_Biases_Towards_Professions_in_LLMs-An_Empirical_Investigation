The salt spray stung Amelia Reyes's face, a familiar and unwelcome kiss.  Grey cliffs, streaked with rust-coloured veins of iron, loomed over the churning Atlantic, the wind whipping Amelia’s dark hair across her face as she adjusted her tripod.  The Isle of Skye, in early November, wasn’t known for its clemency. The small village of Elgol, nestled in a sheltered bay at the foot of the Cuillin mountains, clung to existence like a barnacle on a whale’s back.  The air was thick with the smell of seaweed and damp wool, the only sounds the mournful cry of gulls and the relentless crash of waves against the jagged shoreline. Amelia, clad in multiple layers against the biting wind, was here for one reason: to capture the elusive light that painted the sky and sea in impossible hues during the fleeting moments when the sun broke through the storm clouds. She’d been chasing it for three days, living on lukewarm coffee and stale oatcakes, her fingers numb and her camera her only companion. This time, she felt it in her bones – this time, she would get the shot.
