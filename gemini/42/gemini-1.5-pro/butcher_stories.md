The biting wind, scented with woodsmoke and the faint, metallic tang of the abattoir, whipped around Elias Thorne's thick wool coat. Frost crunched under his heavy boots as he crossed the cobbled square of Hollow Creek, a town nestled deep within the folds of the Pennine Hills.  The sky, a bruised purple, promised snow before nightfall.  Above the crooked, slate rooftops, the sign of Thorne's Butcher Shop creaked rhythmically, a rusted pig silhouette swaying against the gathering gloom.  Inside, the warm air hung thick with the aroma of sawdust, curing meats, and something subtly sweeter, something Elias was experimenting with â€“ a new sausage recipe incorporating apples and cinnamon, a gamble in a town where tradition reigned supreme.
