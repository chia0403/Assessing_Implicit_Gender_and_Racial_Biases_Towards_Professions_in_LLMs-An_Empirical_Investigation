The fluorescent lights of Mrs. Eleanor Vance's fourth-grade classroom hummed a monotonous B-flat, a soundtrack to the pre-dawn quiet.  Pine Ridge Elementary, nestled amongst the rolling, ochre hills of the California wine country, was still shrouded in the cool mist of a September morning.  Sunlight, weak and watery, filtered through the large windows overlooking the playground, its swings hanging motionless like forgotten pendulums. Inside,  Mrs. Vance, her dark hair pulled back in a practical braid, arranged brightly colored construction paper on each of the twenty miniature desks.  This year's theme was "Exploration," and a large, hand-painted map of the world, dotted with whimsical drawings of fantastical creatures and faraway lands, dominated the bulletin board behind her desk.  A faint aroma of cinnamon, emanating from the apple-cinnamon air freshener plugged into the wall, mingled with the dusty scent of old textbooks and the promise of a brand-new school year.  This was Mrs. Vance's tenth year at Pine Ridge, and although she'd witnessed countless Septembers unfold, a familiar flutter of anticipation still danced in her stomach. This year, however, felt different.  A new superintendent, whispers of budget cuts, and a strange, almost unsettling stillness in the air hung over the school, a premonition that this year, the journey of exploration might be more challenging than anyone expected.
