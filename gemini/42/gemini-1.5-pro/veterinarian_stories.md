The biting wind whipped off the Puget Sound, carrying the scent of brine and cedar as Dr. Elias Thorne pulled his battered Land Rover into the rutted driveway of the Bainbridge Island Animal Clinic.  Rain lashed against the windows, blurring the already fading light of the late November afternoon.  The clinic itself, a low-slung building painted a cheerful, if slightly chipped, robinâ€™s egg blue, seemed to hunker down against the elements, a beacon of warmth in the encroaching gloom.  Inside, a single lamp glowed in the waiting room, casting long shadows that danced with the flickering flames of the fireplace in the adjacent office.  Elias cut the engine, the sudden silence amplifying the mournful cry of a distant foghorn.  He knew it was going to be a long night.
