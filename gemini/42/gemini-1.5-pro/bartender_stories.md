Rain lashed against the stained-glass windows of The Gilded Lily, depicting a rather unconvincing St. George battling a decidedly limp dragon.  Inside, the only sounds were the rhythmic clinking of ice against glass as Elias Thorne, the bartender, meticulously crafted an Old Fashioned, and the low rumble of distant thunder.  The Lily, nestled in a forgotten corner of Greenwich Village, was a haven for the city's lost and lonely, a place where secrets whispered in the dim light and sorrows drowned in the bottom of amber-colored glasses.  Tonight, however, it was almost deserted.  Only a lone figure hunched over a corner table, a fedora pulled low over his eyes, and a half-empty bottle of whiskey for company.  Elias, his long fingers tracing the rim of a polished glass, watched him with a detached curiosity, the way a cat might observe a flickering candle flame.  The air was thick with anticipation, the kind that precedes a storm, both meteorological and otherwise.
