The stale air in Anya Sharma’s Corolla thickened with the scent of cheap air freshener and despair.  It was barely 7:00 am, but the July sun was already baking the asphalt of the parking lot outside the dilapidated apartment building. Anya, full name Anya Lakshmi Sharma, adjusted the collar of her crisp white blouse, a futile attempt to combat the rising humidity. Her assigned territory was the sprawl of low-income housing known as the West End, a patchwork of broken dreams and flickering neon signs clinging to the fringes of the once-prosperous mill town of Alder Creek, Pennsylvania. Today’s first client, a repeat offender with a penchant for petty theft and a disturbingly casual attitude towards community service, lived on the third floor, apartment 3B.  Anya sighed, gathering her worn leather briefcase and a thermos of lukewarm coffee, steeling herself for another day navigating the intricate web of broken promises and second chances that defined her life as a probation officer.
