The fluorescent lights of Northwood High hummed a monotonous B-flat, a soundtrack Eleanor Vance had grown accustomed to over her fifteen years as the school's guidance counselor.  Her office, a small, book-lined sanctuary tucked away near the echoing gymnasium, usually offered a welcome respite from the adolescent chaos that swirled just beyond her door. But today, the usually calming aroma of lavender and chamomile from her diffuser couldn't quite mask the undercurrent of tension crackling in the air.  A storm was brewing in Northwood, Oregon, both literally, as evidenced by the ominous grey clouds gathering outside the window, and figuratively, within the very walls of the school.  This particular Monday morning, however, started like any other â€“ with the rhythmic tap-tap-tapping of Eleanor's fingers on her keyboard as she reviewed the alarmingly long list of students scheduled for appointments that week.  Each name represented a potential crisis, a whisper of worry, a cry for help in a world that often felt too loud for teenagers to navigate.  Little did Eleanor know, one name on that list, tucked between a junior struggling with college applications and a senior battling anxiety, was about to shatter the fragile peace of Northwood High.
