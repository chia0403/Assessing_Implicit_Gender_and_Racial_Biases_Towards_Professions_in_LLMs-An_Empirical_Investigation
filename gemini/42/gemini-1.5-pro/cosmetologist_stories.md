The flickering neon sign of "Shear Radiance Salon" cast a lavender glow across the rain-slicked asphalt of Elm Street. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of hairspray, perm solution, and anticipation. Wednesday, November 14th, was always a busy day for  Eleanor Vivienne Holloway, especially the week before Thanksgiving.  Eleanor, her fiery auburn hair pulled back in a sleek ponytail to keep it out of her meticulous work, surveyed her domain.  The salon, nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed antique shop, wasn’t glamorous, but it was hers.  She’d poured every penny she had into renovating the space two years ago, transforming it from a dingy, outdated barbershop into a haven of pampering and self-care. Tonight, however, the usual buzz of blow dryers and friendly chatter was punctuated by a strange, unsettling quiet.  The only other person present was Mrs. Henderson, a regular,  dozing under the heat lamp with her wet-set curls, oblivious to the tension crackling in the air.  Eleanor had a feeling, a prickle of unease at the base of her skull, that tonight’s appointment wasn’t going to be a typical trim and blow-dry.
