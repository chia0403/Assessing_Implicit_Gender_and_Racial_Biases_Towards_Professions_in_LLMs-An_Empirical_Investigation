The biting wind whipped Dr. Elias Thorne's dark coat around his legs as he stepped out of the black sedan.  Glacier National Park in November was a study in stark beauty: snow-laden pines against a backdrop of granite peaks, the turquoise lakes iced over and reflecting the steely grey sky.  Beautiful, yes, but also desolate, echoing the gnawing emptiness in Elias's gut.  He wasn't here to admire the scenery. He was here for a killer.  Specifically, the killer who had left a meticulously arranged tableau of bones beneath a sacred Blackfoot pictograph, a chilling message Elias was brought in to decipher.  The FBI agents waiting for him at the edge of the crime scene, bundled in parkas and looking like disgruntled polar bears, didn't offer much warmth either.  This wasn't the bustling city of Chicago where Elias usually plied his trade; this was the wild, unforgiving heart of Montana, and it felt like the wilderness was already closing in.
