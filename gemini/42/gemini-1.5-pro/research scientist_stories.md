The biting Antarctic wind whipped at Dr. Evelyn Reed’s parka, stinging any exposed skin despite the layers of thermal protection.  The McMurdo Station weather report had promised "mostly clear," but "mostly clear" in Antarctica could still mean a horizontal blizzard capable of burying a snowmobile in minutes.  Evelyn adjusted her goggles and squinted at the readout on the handheld spectrometer.  Nothing.  For three weeks, nothing but the expected background radiation.  She sighed, a plume of condensation crystallizing instantly in the frigid air. This desolate expanse of the Ross Ice Shelf, miles from the relative comfort of the research base, was supposed to be the site of an anomaly, a spike in neutrino detection that defied all known physics.  Evelyn, a rising star in astroparticle physics, had staked her reputation – and a significant portion of the National Science Foundation's budget – on finding it.  Now, with the Antarctic summer rapidly drawing to a close and the relentless polar night looming, she was starting to wonder if it had all been a colossal mistake. The vast, white nothingness stretched before her, an icy testament to the futility of human ambition.
