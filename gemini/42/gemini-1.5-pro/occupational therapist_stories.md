The biting November wind whipped around Eleanor Vance, stinging her cheeks and tugging at the edges of her thick wool scarf.  Grey clouds scudded across the sky, threatening snow over the small town of Havenwood, nestled in the foothills of the Adirondack Mountains.  Fallen leaves, brittle and brown, skittered across the cracked pavement leading to Havenwood Rehab, a low-slung brick building that had seen better days.  Eleanor, her breath puffing out in white clouds, adjusted the heavy bag slung over her shoulder, its contents – therapeutic putty, resistance bands, and a handful of fidget toys – clinking softly.  It was her first day as the resident occupational therapist, and a knot of nervous anticipation tightened in her stomach. Havenwood, with its aging population and dwindling resources, presented a unique challenge, one Eleanor was determined to embrace. The faded "Welcome" sign above the rehab center's entrance seemed to offer a hesitant greeting, and Eleanor paused, steeling herself for whatever lay within.
