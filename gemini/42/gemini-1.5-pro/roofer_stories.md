The tar hissed and bubbled under the July sun, releasing a pungent aroma that clung to Elias Thorne like a second skin.  Sweat trickled down his weathered face, stinging his eyes as he knelt on the scalding shingles of Mrs. Albright’s Victorian monstrosity. From his precarious perch atop the three-story house, he could see the whole of Harmony Creek shimmering beneath the hazy afternoon heat. The small Maine town nestled between the sawtooth peaks of the White Mountains and the placid expanse of Mirror Lake, a place where life moved at the pace of a dripping icicle in January. But today, even Harmony Creek was sweltering. The air hung thick and still, promising a thunderstorm later, and Elias knew he needed to finish patching the leak before the heavens opened.  The old widow’s attic housed a collection of antique porcelain dolls, and he’d rather face a grizzly bear than her wrath if a single drop damaged her precious “children.”
