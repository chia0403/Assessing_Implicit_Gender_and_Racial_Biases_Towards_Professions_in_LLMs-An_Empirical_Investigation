The frosted glass of Amelia Grace Holloway's office door declared, in elegant gold lettering, "A.G. Holloway, Bookkeeping & Financial Services."  It was a lie of omission, really.  Amelia handled the books for exactly one client:  The Whispering Pines Retirement Community, a sprawling complex of pastel bungalows and manicured lawns nestled amidst the ancient redwood forests of coastal northern California. The fog, a near-constant companion, clung to the towering trees this morning, muting the usual cacophony of birdsong and lending an ethereal silence to the scene.  Inside, Amelia sat hunched over a mountain of receipts, the scent of pine needles and damp earth drifting in through the open window.  A chipped mug of lukewarm tea sat beside her, forgotten, as she meticulously entered figures into her well-worn ledger.  It was a Thursday, generally a quiet day at Whispering Pines, but Amelia had a feeling this one was going to be anything but.  A single, crisp hundred-dollar bill, tucked between two grocery receipts for prune juice and denture adhesive, had caught her eye.  And hundred-dollar bills were not the usual currency of retirees.
