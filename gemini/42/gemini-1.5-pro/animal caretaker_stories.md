The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Amy” Hawthorne’s auburn braid across her face as she trudged through the ankle-deep mud towards the primate enclosure.  The sky above the Peak District Wildlife Sanctuary was the colour of a bruised plum, threatening snow.  Amy pulled her thick, fleece-lined jacket tighter around her and inhaled deeply, the crisp air stinging her nostrils with the scent of pine and damp earth.  Dawn hadn't fully broken yet, painting the rolling hills surrounding the sanctuary in shades of grey and indigo.  The only sounds were the rustling of leaves in the nearby beechwood and the distant, mournful cry of a red kite circling high above.  Amy’s breath puffed out in white clouds, momentarily obscuring the padlock she was fumbling with on the gate leading to the gibbon enclosure. Inside, she could hear the soft whoops of Milo and Luna, anticipating their breakfast.
