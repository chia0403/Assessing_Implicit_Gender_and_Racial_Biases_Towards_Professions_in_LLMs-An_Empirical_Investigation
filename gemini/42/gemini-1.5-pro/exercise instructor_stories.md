The rhythmic thump of eighties synth-pop echoed off the mirrored walls of "Body By Beatrix," the air thick with the scent of sweat and lemon-scented disinfectant.  Rain lashed against the large windows overlooking the grey expanse of Lake Michigan, blurring the Chicago skyline into a hazy watercolour.  Inside, a kaleidoscope of neon spandex clung to bodies in various states of exertion, their movements guided by the energetic shouts of Beatrix "Bea" Rodriguez.  Bea, her dark curls plastered to her forehead, bounced on the balls of her feet, a wireless microphone clipped to the collar of her vibrant fuchsia leotard.  "And five, six, seven, eight!  Feel the burn, people!  Embrace the pain!  This is where we sculpt those summer bodies!"  Her voice, though amplified, held a warmth that belied her drill sergeant-like instructions.  Outside, the wind howled, a mournful counterpoint to the relentless beat of the music and the rhythmic grunts of the class.  But within the brightly lit sanctuary of Bea's studio, a different kind of storm was brewing.
