The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, carrying the scent of brine and sawdust to Elias Thorne, stinging his cheeks as he adjusted the heavy timber frame.  Grey clouds, thick and pregnant with rain, clung low over the skeletal half-built house.  Saltholme Sands, a small fishing village nestled between the unforgiving sea and the stark, heather-covered moors of Yorkshire, was a place of hard beauty and even harder lives. This house, perched precariously close to the cliff edge, was Elias's latest commission, a testament to the stubborn resilience of the villagers who clung to this windswept corner of the world.  He squinted at the horizon, where the sky met the churning grey of the waves, and a shiver, not entirely from the cold, ran down his spine.  Something about this build, about this place, feltâ€¦ different.
