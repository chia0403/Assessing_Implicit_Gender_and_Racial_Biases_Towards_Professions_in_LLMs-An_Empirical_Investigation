The flickering neon sign of the "Desert Rose Motel" buzzed a sickly green against the bruised purple of the pre-dawn sky.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of grit and despair, danced across the cracked asphalt of Highway 17, just outside of Harmony Springs, Nevada.  Inside room 107, Beatrice “Bea” Goldfinch, regional sales representative for "Happy Homewares,"  struggled to wrestle the limp, floral-patterned curtains closed against the encroaching light.  She had a splitting headache, a rumbling stomach, and a sales quota that felt as distant as the moon.  Harmony Springs was the last stop on her two-week tour of the Nevada desert, and so far, it hadn't exactly been a goldmine.  In fact, she’d sold precisely three novelty cactus-shaped cheese graters and a single set of self-stirring soup spoons. Bea sighed, the sound swallowed by the vast, empty landscape outside. This was going to be a long day.
