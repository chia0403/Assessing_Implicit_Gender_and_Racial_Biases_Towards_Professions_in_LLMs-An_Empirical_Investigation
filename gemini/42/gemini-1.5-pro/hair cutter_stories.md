The flickering neon sign of "Clementine's Clips and Cuts" buzzed a tired, blueish light onto the rain-slicked streets of Port Blossom, Oregon.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of coconut shampoo and the faint ghost of perm solution. Rain lashed against the large front window, blurring the view of the deserted marina across the street. Clementine "Clem" Hawthorne, her name stitched in swirling cursive on a faded denim apron, leaned against the worn barber chair, idly snipping at a frayed thread on its armrest.  Her salon, a cozy box of a place sandwiched between a laundromat and a perpetually closed antique shop, was empty.  The clock above the cash register, a chrome monstrosity shaped like a pair of scissors, ticked towards 6 pm, the end of another slow Tuesday.  Clem sighed, the sound swallowed by the rhythmic drumming of the rain and the low hum of the fluorescent lights overhead.  Port Blossom, once a bustling fishing town, was slowly drying up, and Clem's business along with it.
