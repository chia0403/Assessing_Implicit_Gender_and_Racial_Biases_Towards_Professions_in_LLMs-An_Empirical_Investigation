The flickering fluorescent lights of the Quick Stop buzzed like trapped insects, casting a sickly yellow glow across the aisles of expired candy and dusty bags of chips.  Rain lashed against the single window, blurring the neon "Open" sign into a hazy smear.  Inside, Amelia Reyes, her name tag slightly askew on her faded blue uniform, leaned against the counter, chewing on the end of a Bic pen.  It was 7:47 pm on a Tuesday, and the only sound besides the rain and the buzzing lights was the rhythmic *thump-thump* of the ancient refrigerator struggling to keep the lukewarm sodas cool.  Amelia was certain she'd seen tumbleweeds roll down Main Street earlier that day, and she wouldn't have been surprised if one blew through the automatic doors any minute now.  Dust Devil, Nevada wasn't exactly a bustling metropolis.
