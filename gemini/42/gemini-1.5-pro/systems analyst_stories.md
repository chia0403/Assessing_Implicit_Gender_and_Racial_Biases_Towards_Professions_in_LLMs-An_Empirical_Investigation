Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of the Zephyr Holdings building, blurring the Seattle skyline into a watercolor of greys and blues. Inside, the air buzzed with a nervous energy Amelia “Amy” Chen hadn’t experienced in her five years as a systems analyst.  Fluorescent lights hummed above the open-plan office, reflecting off the anxious faces hunched over glowing monitors.  Amy, wrapped in a worn cardigan despite the stifling heat generated by the overworked servers, tapped a frantic rhythm on her desk.  It was 3:17 am, and Zephyr’s flagship e-commerce platform, the one Amy had poured months into optimizing, was experiencing a catastrophic, and inexplicable, system failure. Orders weren't processing, inventory was glitching, and the customer service lines were melting down.  Black Friday, the biggest shopping day of the year, was less than twelve hours away, and the digital equivalent of a storefront fire was raging.
