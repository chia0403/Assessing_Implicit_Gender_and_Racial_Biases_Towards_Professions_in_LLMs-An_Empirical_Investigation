The flickering fluorescent lights of the Zenith BioTech research wing hummed a lonely tune, their pallid glow reflecting off the polished linoleum floor.  Elias Thorne, his name tag slightly askew on his faded blue uniform, pushed his janitorial cart down the deserted hallway.  It was 2:17 am, the quietest hour in the building, a time when the whirring servers and the distant thrum of the ventilation system were the only audible companions. Zenith BioTech, a gleaming tower of glass and steel that pierced the Seattle skyline, was a cathedral of scientific ambition by day.  By night, it belonged to Elias, his domain stretching from the echoing lobby to the locked laboratories where secrets simmered in sterile petri dishes. Tonight, however, a different kind of silence hung in the air, a stillness that prickled the back of Elias's neck. It wasn't the usual quiet; it was the quiet of something being held back, something waiting to be unleashed.
