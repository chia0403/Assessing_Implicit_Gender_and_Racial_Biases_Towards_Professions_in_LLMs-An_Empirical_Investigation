The stale, recycled air hummed a monotonous tune as Amelia "Amy" Reyes smoothed down the wrinkles of her navy blue uniform skirt. Outside, the tarmac of JFK International Airport shimmered under the relentless July sun, a mirage of heat waves rising from the asphalt. Amy glanced at her watch – 14:52.  Flight 42 to Tokyo was boarding in eight minutes, and already the gate area buzzed with the low thrum of anticipation. Families clustered together, businessmen tapped away on laptops, and a gaggle of teenagers chattered excitedly, their selfie sticks held aloft like futuristic antennae. Amy took a deep breath, the faint scent of jet fuel mixing with the cloying sweetness of someone’s duty-free perfume. This was her fourth transpacific flight this week, and although weariness tugged at the edges of her smile, a familiar thrill of adventure still sparked within her.  This flight, she had a feeling, was going to be different.
