Elias, his breath puffing out in white clouds, finally managed to jiggle the key free and stepped into the dimly lit reception area.  The faint scent of lavender and peppermint, a carefully curated atmosphere of calm, did little to soothe the knot of unease tightening in his stomach. This wasn't just the pre-dawn chill; something feltâ€¦off.
