The first rays of dawn, a pale, watery pink, were just beginning to paint the sky above the looming shadow of Mount Cinder, a dormant volcano that whispered tales of forgotten magic to those who listened closely enough. Elara shivered, not entirely from the cold, and fumbled with the oversized iron key, the chill metal biting into her ungloved hand.  Today was the annual Cinderfest, and Elara had a mountain of cinder cakes to bake.
