The clatter of horse-drawn carriages on cobblestones echoed through the narrow, gaslit alleyway known as Cutter's Close.  A persistent drizzle, the sort that clung to the thick London fog and turned it a greasy grey, slicked the uneven pavement.  Here, nestled between a butcher shop that perpetually smelled of offal and a public house exuding the sour tang of stale beer, sat the modest establishment of Elias Finch, Tailor & Draper.  The shop's single window, displaying a handsomely draped length of emerald green velvet, was illuminated by a flickering gas lamp that cast long, dancing shadows across the neatly arranged bolts of cloth within.  Inside, Elias Finch himself, a man of slight build with needle-pricked fingers and eyes the precise shade of a well-worn thimble, hunched over his workbench, the rhythmic snip-snip of his shears a counterpoint to the city's clamor.  He was meticulously unpicking the seams of a gentleman's coat, his brow furrowed in concentration, oblivious to the approaching footsteps that squelched through the grime outside his door.
