The biting November wind whipped fallen leaves into frenzied spirals across the cracked asphalt of the Northwood High parking lot.  A smear of bruised purple stained the horizon, hinting at the rapidly approaching twilight.

Outside, the school bell clanged, signaling the end of another day, but instead of the usual surge of relief, a prickle of unease settled in Eleanor’s stomach. Something felt…off.
