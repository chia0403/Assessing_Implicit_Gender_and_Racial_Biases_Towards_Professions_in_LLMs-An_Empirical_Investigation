Her small kitchen, tucked away in the back of "The Salty Spoon" diner, was a symphony of sizzling bacon, the rhythmic thud of the meat tenderizer, and the percussive clang of spatula against griddle.

The salty tang of the Pacific hung heavy in the air, mingling with the sweet aroma of Amy’s cinnamon rolls, a scent that promised comfort and familiarity to the regulars who filed in each morning.  Outside, the fog was just beginning to lift, revealing glimpses of the grey, churning ocean and the weathered fishing boats bobbing in the harbor. It was a Tuesday, much like any other Tuesday in Seabrook, or so it seemed.
