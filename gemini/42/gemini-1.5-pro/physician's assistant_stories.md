The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Reyes's dark hair across her face as she hurried across the cobbled streets of Port Blossom, Maine.  The salt spray from the churning Atlantic stung her cheeks, a familiar sensation for anyone living in this quaint, seaside town. The colorful Victorian houses lining the street, normally cheerful with their gingerbread trim, seemed to huddle together against the impending storm, their windows glowing warm and inviting against the darkening sky.  Amy clutched her satchel tighter, the leather cool against her gloved hand.  She was late, already ten minutes behind schedule for her evening rounds at Elderwood Assisted Living, and Mrs. Higgins, with her notoriously fragile hip, would be waiting.  The scent of woodsmoke and brine hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma that did little to ease the knot of anxiety tightening in Amy's stomach.  Something about tonight felt different, a prickle of unease she couldn't quite shake.
