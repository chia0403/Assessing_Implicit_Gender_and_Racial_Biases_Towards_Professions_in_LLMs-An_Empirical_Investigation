The flickering fluorescent lights of Harold Finch's cramped office cast long, distorted shadows across the overflowing stacks of tax returns.  April 14th, the day before the dreaded Tax Day deadline, hung heavy in the air like a stale cigarette.  Outside, the sleepy town of Harmony Glade, Oregon, was bathed in the soft, pre-dawn light.  Rain pattered gently against the windowpane, a melancholic soundtrack to Harold's caffeine-fueled race against the clock. His office, sandwiched between a laundromat and a perpetually closed antique shop, was a testament to organized chaos.  Every available surface was covered in a blizzard of 1040s, W-2s, and schedules of various bewildering complexities. Harold Finch, CPA, was in his element, a general amidst a paper war, fueled by lukewarm coffee and the sheer, unadulterated panic of procrastinating taxpayers.  He hadnâ€™t slept properly in days, his tie was askew, and his usually meticulous hair stuck up at odd angles, but a strange sense of calm had settled over him.  He was a master of deductions, a virtuoso of exemptions, a tax wizard, and this was his Super Bowl.
