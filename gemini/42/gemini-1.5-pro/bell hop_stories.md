The revolving doors of the Grand Majestic Hotel whispered a sigh every time they spun, pushing in gusts of crisp autumn air scented with fallen leaves and exhaust fumes from the bustling Chicago street.  Inside, the lobby shimmered with polished marble and the low hum of polite conversation.  Sunlight streamed through the arched windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air above a massive bouquet of calla lilies. This was Bartholomew "Barty" Higgins's domain, his kingdom of gleaming brass luggage carts, impatient guests, and the occasional misplaced chihuahua. Barty, in his neatly pressed maroon uniform with gold braiding, stood poised near the entrance, a practiced smile plastered on his face. He anticipated the rush â€“ the afternoon influx of conventioneers arriving for the annual Midwest Dentistry Symposium, an event guaranteed to generate enough lost toothbrushes and denture adhesive inquiries to last him a lifetime.  The year was 1938, and despite the lingering shadow of the Great Depression, the Grand Majestic, with its art deco flourishes and air of timeless elegance, still attracted a clientele accustomed to a certain level of pampering.  Barty, more than most, understood the art of providing that pampering, of anticipating needs before they were even voiced.  He knew which regulars preferred their newspapers ironed, which honeymooners required extra pillows, and which businessmen were most likely to slip a generous tip into a discreetly offered palm.  But on this particular afternoon, something felt different, a subtle shift in the air like the quiet hum before a thunderstorm.
