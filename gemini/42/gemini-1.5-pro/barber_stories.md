The flickering neon sign of "Finnian O'Malley's Tonsorial Parlour" cast a lurid, emerald glow across the perpetually damp cobblestones of Aethelburg Alley. Rain, a constant companion in this forgotten corner of New Birmingham, hammered against the leaded pane window, each drop a miniature explosion of sound against the backdrop of the city’s distant, mechanical hum. Inside, amidst the warm, soapy scent of bay rum and the comforting buzz of clippers, Finnian O’Malley himself stood, a small, wiry man with hands that moved with the precision of a clockmaker. His shop, a sanctuary of mahogany and polished brass, was a stark contrast to the grime and decay that clung to everything outside its door.  A single green-shaded lamp illuminated his current client, a hulking figure draped in a threadbare cloak, whose face remained obscured by the wide brim of a fedora.  The only sound besides the rhythmic snip of Finnian's scissors was the relentless drumming of the rain, a steady percussive beat that hinted at secrets lurking in the shadowed alleyways just beyond the warm glow of the barbershop.
