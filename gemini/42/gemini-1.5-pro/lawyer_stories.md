Rain lashed against the stained-glass windows of Saint Jude's, blurring the flickering candlelight within.  Amelia Grace Holloway, Esquire, shifted uncomfortably in the hard pew, the damp chill seeping through her tailored wool coat. The scent of incense and old hymnals mingled with the metallic tang of rain on wrought iron, a fragrance that usually brought her a sense of peace.  Tonight, however,  it did little to soothe the knot of anxiety twisting in her stomach. The funeral service for Judge Elias Thorne had concluded, but Amelia lingered, watching as the last of the mourners filed out into the storm-swept streets of Charleston, South Carolina.  The historic city, usually vibrant with charm, felt oppressive under the heavy grey sky, mirroring the weight in Ameliaâ€™s heart. Judge Thorne had been more than just a respected jurist; he'd been her mentor, her friend, and the one person in this city who truly believed in her. Now, he was gone, and with him, Amelia felt a crucial piece of her own foundation crumble.
