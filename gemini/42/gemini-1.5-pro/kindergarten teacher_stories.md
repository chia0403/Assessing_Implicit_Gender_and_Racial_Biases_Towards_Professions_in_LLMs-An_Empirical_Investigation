The insistent chirping of a rogue cricket, somehow trapped inside Ms. Eleanor Vance's classroom, punctuated the otherwise quiet hush of a Sunday afternoon.  Sunlight, filtered through the dusty rainbow window film Eleanor had painstakingly applied last summer, cast fractured prisms of color across the miniature tables and chairs. Tiny handprints, ghosts of finger paint and glue, speckled the surfaces like a vibrant, chaotic nebula.  Room 2B of Sunny Meadow Elementary, nestled in the sleepy, apple-orchard-dotted town of Harmony Creek, Oregon, usually buzzed with the frenetic energy of five-year-olds. Today, however, it held only Eleanor, the lingering scent of construction paper and the elusive chirping cricket, its song a constant reminder of a mystery she was determined to solve.
