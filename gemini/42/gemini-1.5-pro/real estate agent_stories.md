The late afternoon sun, a hazy apricot hue, slanted through the smog hanging over the San Fernando Valley, painting the stucco walls of the Spanish-style bungalow a warm, inviting orange.  Dust motes danced in the golden rays that streamed through the arched entryway, illuminating a "For Sale" sign staked jauntily on the patchy lawn.  Amelia Reyes, her crisp white blouse clinging slightly to her back in the lingering heat, adjusted the sign, ensuring it was perfectly perpendicular to the street. This was her listing, and Amelia, a woman who prided herself on meticulousness, believed even the smallest details mattered.  The scent of jasmine, heavy and sweet, wafted from a neglected bush by the front steps, a poignant contrast to the faint smell of chlorine from the unseen, undoubtedly turquoise, pool lurking in the backyard. This property, on a quiet cul-de-sac in Encino, had been a tough sell â€“ overpriced, dated, and with a history as colourful as the bougainvillea spilling over the neighbour's fence. But Amelia, ever the optimist, was determined to find the right buyer, even if it meant staging another open house on a sweltering Sunday afternoon.
