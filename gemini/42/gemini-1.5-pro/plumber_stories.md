The rusty wrench slipped in Elias Finch's greasy hand, clanging against the porcelain sink with a discordant *ting*. He sighed, the sound swallowed by the echoing dampness of the abandoned textile mill. Dust motes danced in the weak beams of his headlamp, illuminating a scene of decaying grandeur.  Massive looms, still draped in cobwebs like ghostly shrouds, loomed over him, silent sentinels of a bygone era. Outside, the November wind howled through the broken panes of the mill's towering windows, a mournful cry that harmonized with the dripping pipes Elias had been called to fix.  He hadn't expected a plumbing emergency in the derelict Grimshaw Mill, a place whispered about in hushed tones by the locals of Hollow Creek as being haunted. But the new owner, a mysterious out-of-towner named Mr. Silas Crowe, had insisted on having running water, no matter the cost. And Elias, a man perpetually two weeks behind on his bills, wasn't one to turn down a paying job, ghosts or not.
