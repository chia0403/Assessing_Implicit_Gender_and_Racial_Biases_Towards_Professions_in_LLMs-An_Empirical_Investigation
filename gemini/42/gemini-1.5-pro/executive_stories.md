Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Amelia Thorne’s forty-second-floor office, blurring the already fading London skyline into a hazy watercolour of greys and muted golds.  The rhythmic drumming of the downpour echoed the frantic tattoo of Amelia’s fingers on her mahogany desk.  Spread before her, like the scattered pieces of a broken puzzle, were the quarterly reports.  Each page, filled with stark red figures, screamed of impending disaster for Thorne Industries, the multi-billion dollar fashion empire built by her grandfather and painstakingly maintained, albeit with increasing difficulty, by her for the last decade.  Outside, St. Paul’s Cathedral, usually a stoic sentinel against the capricious whims of the English weather, seemed to cower beneath the onslaught. Inside, the air crackled with a tension so thick it could be cut with the obsidian letter opener resting beside the damning reports. Amelia pushed a stray strand of auburn hair from her face, her emerald eyes, usually sparkling with confidence, now reflecting the storm raging both within and without.  This wasn't just a bad quarter; this was a catastrophe.
