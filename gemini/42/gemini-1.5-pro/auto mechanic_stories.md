The flickering fluorescent lights of Rosie's Auto Repair buzzed like trapped hornets, casting a sickly yellow glow across the grease-stained concrete floor.  Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless rhythm that echoed the gnawing anxiety in Eliza Jane Holloway's stomach.  It was a Tuesday, usually slow, but today the garage was eerily silent.  Her only companion was a half-disassembled '67 Mustang, its engine guts spilling out onto a wheeled trolley like metallic entrails. Outside, the wind howled through the skeletal remains of a billboard advertising "Buck's Best Burgers," a reminder of the thriving town this place used to be before the interstate diverted all the traffic – and all the business – miles away. Rust Creek, Arizona, was slowly dying, and Eliza Jane, along with her garage, felt like she was going down with the ship.
