The chipped porcelain mermaid on Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's desk stared blankly out at the ceaseless drizzle coating the cobbled streets of Port Blossom, Oregon.  Amy, tucked into her worn velvet armchair, sighed, the sound swallowed by the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock that had probably seen more exotic locales than she had.  Her travel agency, "Wanderlust Whispers," occupied a quaint, slightly dilapidated building sandwiched between a bakery perpetually smelling of cinnamon and a dusty antique shop.  Port Blossom itself, a town more accustomed to the salty tang of the Pacific than the aroma of far-off spices, wasn't exactly a hub for international travel.  Most of Amy's clients booked trips to nearby seaside resorts or, if feeling particularly adventurous, a weekend in Portland.  Today, however, felt different.  A strange, electric anticipation hummed in the air, a feeling as foreign to Port Blossom as a mango in a blizzard.
