Rain lashed against the attic window, a relentless drumming that mirrored the anxiety churning in Elias Thorne's stomach.  The only light in the cramped, dusty space came from a flickering bare bulb hanging precariously from a rafter, casting long, dancing shadows across the unfinished wooden floorboards.  Stacks of manuscripts, some neatly bound, others spilling loose pages like fallen leaves, surrounded Eliasâ€™s ancient typewriter.  He hunched over the keys, his fingers hovering, poised but hesitant. Outside, the wind howled around the eaves of Seabrook Manor, a crumbling Victorian mansion perched on the windswept cliffs of the Cornish coast.  The salt spray, driven by the gale, stung the single pane of glass, blurring the already obscured view of the churning Atlantic below.  Elias had inherited the manor, a crumbling testament to a forgotten family fortune, six months ago, hoping the solitude would unlock the writer's block that had plagued him for years.  So far, the only thing unlocked had been a growing sense of unease.
