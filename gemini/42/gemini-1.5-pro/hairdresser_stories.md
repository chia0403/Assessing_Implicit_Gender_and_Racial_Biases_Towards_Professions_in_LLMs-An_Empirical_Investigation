Sunlight, filtered through the lace curtains, danced across the worn linoleum floor, illuminating dust motes swirling in the golden beams.  Elsie Mae, a woman whose smile lines were as prominent as her expertly coiffed bouffant, adjusted her leopard-print apron and smoothed down the front of her pristine white blouse, ready to transform another Port Blossom resident into their most fabulous self.
