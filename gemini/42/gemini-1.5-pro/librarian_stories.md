The scent of old paper and leather clung to Elias Thorne like a second skin. It was a comforting aroma, familiar and predictable in a world that often wasn't.  Elias, full name Elias Peregrine Thorne, adjusted his spectacles and surveyed the hushed rows of the Abernathy Library, a grand Victorian structure nestled amidst the bustling modernity of Portland, Oregon.  Rain lashed against the tall, arched windows, blurring the cityscape into a watercolour of greys and greens. Inside, the warm glow of brass lamps cast long shadows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air.  The library, a sanctuary of quiet contemplation, held secrets within its walls â€“ not just within the pages of its countless volumes, but also in the hushed whispers of its patrons and the very fabric of the building itself. Elias, guardian of these secrets, knew this better than anyone.  This Tuesday morning, however, promised to be anything but ordinary.
