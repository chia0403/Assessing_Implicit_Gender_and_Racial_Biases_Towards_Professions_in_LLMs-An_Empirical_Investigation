The clatter of a horse-drawn carriage passing over cobblestones echoed through the small shop, momentarily drowning out the rhythmic whir of Amelia Rose Hawthorne's treadle sewing machine.  Sunlight, filtered through the dusty panes of the bay window, illuminated motes of dust dancing in the air around bolts of vibrant silk and shimmering satin.  Amelia's shop, "Hawthorne's Haberdashery and Haute Couture," nestled between a bustling bakery and a somewhat disreputable tavern on Lavender Lane in the heart of Victorian-era London, was a kaleidoscope of colour and texture.  Heaps of fabric overflowed from wicker baskets, ribbons cascaded from antique spools, and half-finished gowns draped elegantly over dress forms, whispering promises of glamour and transformation.  The air was thick with the scent of lavender sachets, freshly pressed linen, and the faint, metallic tang of needles and pins.
