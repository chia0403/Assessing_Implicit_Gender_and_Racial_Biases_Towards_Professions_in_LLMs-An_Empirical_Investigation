The fluorescent lights of the Derwent Dental Clinic hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Elara Juniper Finch’s Tuesday morning. Rain lashed against the large picture window showcasing a perfectly manicured lawn, the droplets blurring the view of the grey stone fountain cherub whose perpetually surprised expression Elara found oddly comforting.  The clinic, nestled amongst a row of red-brick Georgian townhouses on Cavendish Square, exuded an air of quiet, expensive professionalism – all polished mahogany, hushed tones, and the faint, antiseptic scent of mouthwash.  At 8:55 am, precisely five minutes before the first patient was due, Elara straightened the already meticulously arranged appointment book, her coral lipstick a vibrant splash of colour against the pristine white of her uniform.  The silence was broken only by the rhythmic tapping of her acrylic nails on the polished desk, a nervous habit she was perpetually trying to break.  Today, however, the nervous energy wasn't entirely due to her manicure. Something felt different, a prickle of anticipation in the air, like the quiet before a storm.
