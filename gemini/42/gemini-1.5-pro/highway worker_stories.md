The biting wind whipped across the desolate stretch of Interstate 90, carrying with it the mournful whistle of a distant freight train.  Flakes of snow, tiny and sharp as needles, stung Elias Vance's exposed cheeks as he surveyed the cracked asphalt ribbon stretching before him.  The digital thermometer on the dashboard of his orange Ford F-350 read a baleful -12Â°F.  Elias, bundled in layers of thermal underwear, a fleece-lined parka, and heavy orange overalls, stamped his feet, trying to coax some life back into his toes.  Dawn was still an hour away, painting the eastern sky a bruised purple, and the only illumination came from the pulsating amber lights of his truck and the twin sodium-vapor lamps casting a sickly yellow glow over the rest area he was tasked with clearing. Just east of Billings, Montana, the world felt empty, save for Elias and the whispering ghosts of travelers long past.  This isolated patch of concrete, usually bustling with weary truckers and road-trippers, was now deserted, locked in winter's icy grip.  Today's job was simple: clear the rest stop's parking lot of the foot of snow that had fallen overnight, ensuring it was safe for the few hardy souls brave enough to venture out in this weather. But Elias had a feeling, a prickling unease in the back of his neck, that this wouldn't be just another routine Tuesday.
