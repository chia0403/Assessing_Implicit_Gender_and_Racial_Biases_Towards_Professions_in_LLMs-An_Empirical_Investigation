The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorneâ€™s ankles as he stood on the balcony of his thirty-second-floor apartment, overlooking the churning grey expanse of the East River.  The city lights, usually a comforting, shimmering tapestry, felt cold and distant tonight.  Elias, usually impeccably dressed, had shed his Savile Row suit for a worn cashmere sweater and slacks.  His tie was loosened, a rare concession to discomfort.  The panoramic view, a testament to his success as a stockbroker at the prestigious firm of Blackwood & Sterling, offered little solace.  His apartment, a minimalist masterpiece of steel and glass, echoed with the hollow silence of a life lived at breakneck speed, a life that tonight felt precariously balanced on the edge of a precipice.  The scotch in his hand, a 25-year-old Macallan, normally a symbol of his hard-won triumphs, tasted like ash.  Something was wrong. Deeply wrong. And it wasn't the market.
