Judge Thorne, a man known for his unwavering adherence to the law and his ice-blue gaze that could pierce even the most hardened criminal, pushed aside a stack of parchment, the unsolved Ripper cases weighing heavily on his mind.  Each victim, another name etched into the city's growing fear, a testament to the shadow that haunted not just the East End, but the hallowed halls of justice itself.
