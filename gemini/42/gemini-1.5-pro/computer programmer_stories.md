The flickering neon sign of "The Binary Bean" cast a sickly green glow across Amelia Grace Chen's rain-streaked glasses.  November in Seattle was a relentless drizzle punctuated by the occasional downpour, and tonight was no exception.  Inside the 24-hour cafe, the air hung thick with the scent of burnt coffee and desperation, a familiar aroma for Amelia.  She huddled deeper into her oversized hoodie, the glow of her laptop illuminating her tired face.  Lines of code scrolled across the screen, a complex algorithm for predicting stock market fluctuations, a project she’d taken on as a desperate attempt to break free from the soul-crushing monotony of coding data entry software. Outside, the rain hammered against the windowpane, mirroring the frantic rhythm of her fingers on the keyboard. The cafe, usually buzzing with other nocturnal coders and students cramming for exams, was eerily quiet tonight, just Amelia, the barista with the perpetually bored expression, and a low hum emanating from the malfunctioning refrigerator in the corner.  Tonight, something felt different.  The air was charged with a strange energy, a static hum that prickled Amelia’s skin.
