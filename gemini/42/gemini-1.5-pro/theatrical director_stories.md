The peeling paint of the Rialto Theatre in Alderton, Ohio, whispered stories of forgotten vaudeville acts and half-empty matinees. Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight that pierced the gloom, illuminating a chipped porcelain cherub clinging precariously to the proscenium arch.  Here, amidst the ghosts of past performances and the scent of stale popcorn,  Elias Thorne Merriweather, a theatrical director of some renown (at least in his own mind), surveyed the wreckage.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a mournful counterpoint to the rhythmic drip, drip, drip of a leaky pipe stage left. This was his canvas. His challenge. His potential masterpiece – or his utter ruin.  The Alderton Amateur Dramatics Society had entrusted him, Elias Thorne Merriweather, with the daunting task of staging their annual production, and this year, they’d chosen something truly ambitious: a musical adaptation of "Moby Dick."
