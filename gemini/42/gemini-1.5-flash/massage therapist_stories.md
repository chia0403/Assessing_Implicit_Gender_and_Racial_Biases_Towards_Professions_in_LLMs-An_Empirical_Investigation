The scent of sandalwood and lavender hung heavy in the air, a comforting balm against the relentless drumming of the rain against the corrugated iron roof of Serenity Spa.  Rain lashed against the windows of Anya Petrova’s tiny treatment room, blurring the already indistinct view of the overgrown hibiscus bushes that clawed at the building’s weathered facade.  Inside, the room was a haven of warm, dim light, punctuated only by the flickering candlelight on the small table beside the massage table.  Anya, a woman whose hands held the quiet strength of years spent soothing aching muscles and weary souls, meticulously prepared for her next client.  The rhythmic patter of the rain provided a surprisingly soothing soundtrack to her careful unfolding of crisp, white linen sheets, the soft rustle a counterpoint to the deeper rumble of thunder that vibrated through the floorboards.  Tonight, however, the usual tranquility of her evening was about to be shattered.
