The scent of aged leather and expensive perfume hung heavy in the air, a familiar fragrance to Augustina “Gus” Moreau.  Rain lashed against the vast, arched windows of the Grand Hôtel de Paris, blurring the glittering lights of the Monaco coastline into a hazy, impressionistic masterpiece.  Gus, perched on her high-backed stool behind the polished mahogany desk of the hotel’s concierge desk, adjusted the tiny, diamond-encrusted pen nestled between her fingers.  Her perfectly coiffed auburn hair, usually a fiery beacon, was subdued tonight, mirroring the muted intensity of the storm outside.  The hotel, a silent giant of Belle Époque grandeur, hummed with a low thrum of quiet luxury – a luxury that Gus, despite her privileged position, often found stifling.  Tonight, however, the usual hushed elegance was punctuated by a distinct tremor of unease, a subtle shift in the atmosphere that only a concierge with Gus’s twenty years of experience could detect.  The first drop of a very different kind of storm was about to fall.
