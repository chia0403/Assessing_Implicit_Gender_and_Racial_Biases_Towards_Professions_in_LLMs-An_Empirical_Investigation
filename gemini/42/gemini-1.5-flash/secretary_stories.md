The chipped porcelain teacup warmed Amelia Katherine Finch's fingers, a small comfort against the biting November wind whistling through the gaps in the office window.  Rain lashed against the panes, blurring the already indistinct cityscape of Manchester, a grey canvas punctuated by the occasional flickering neon sign.

Her desk, a chaotic arrangement of overflowing in-trays, half-finished reports, and a perpetually sticky jar of Werther's Originals, mirrored the tempest raging outside.  The air in the office of Grimshaw & Sons, Solicitors, hung thick with the scent of damp wool coats and the lingering aroma of yesterday's lukewarm coffee.  Tonight, however, a different scent mingled with the familiar â€“ a sharp, metallic tang that hinted at something far more unsettling than a spilled cup of joe.
