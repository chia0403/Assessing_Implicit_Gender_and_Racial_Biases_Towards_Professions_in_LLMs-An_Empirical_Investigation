The fluorescent lights of "Quick Stop Mart" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Hernandez's Tuesday night.  The air, thick with the cloying sweetness of artificially ripened bananas and the faint, lingering scent of stale coffee, clung to Amelia like a second skin.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the already indistinct neon glow of the liquor store across the street.  Amelia, her nametag slightly askew, rested her chin on her hand, the plastic scanner feeling cold against her palm.  Another slow night.  Another slow Tuesday. Another night of contemplating the existential dread that only comes with scanning endless barcodes and listening to the repetitive groans of the refrigerator unit in the back.
