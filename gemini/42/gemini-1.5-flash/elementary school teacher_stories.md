The fluorescent lights of Hawthorne Elementary hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the chaotic symphony of giggling children spilling out of classrooms at the final bell.  Dust motes, illuminated in the harsh glare, danced in the air like tiny, exhausted fairies.  Amelia Grace Hawthorne, a woman whose name seemed almost too perfectly suited to her profession, sighed, the sound swallowed by the receding tide of youthful energy.  Her sensible beige cardigan, a testament to years spent navigating the sticky fingers and exuberant outbursts of eight-year-olds, felt heavy on her shoulders.  The last vestiges of the day's lesson plan – a crumpled worksheet depicting the lifecycle of a butterfly – lay abandoned on her desk, a testament to the day's triumphs and inevitable, endearing chaos.  Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the cracked asphalt of the playground, promising a cooler evening after the relentless summer heat had finally begun to loosen its grip on the small town of Harmony Creek.
