The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful dirge around Amelia "Amy" Hernandez as she wrestled the heavy, canvas-covered sled across the frozen tundra.  The air, thin and frigid at fifteen below zero, snatched at her exposed cheeks, instantly transforming them into fiery pinpricks of pain.  She tugged her parka tighter, the fur-lined hood offering little respite from the relentless assault.  Ahead, the skeletal silhouette of the remote Inupiaq village of Kaktovik clawed at the bruised twilight sky, a collection of snow-laden houses huddled together for mutual warmth against the unforgiving landscape.  Amy, a physician's assistant with the Arctic Medical Outreach Program, was the only medical professional for hundreds of miles, a fact that weighed heavily on her shoulders, especially tonight.  The emergency radio call had been garbled, the message barely decipherable through the static:  "Child…sick…serious…need help…"  The urgency in the crackling transmission had spurred Amy into action, forcing her to abandon the relative comfort of her small cabin and brave the elements in her desperate race against the fading light and the encroaching arctic night.
