Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long, skeletal shadows across the cityscape, a stark contrast to the controlled, two-dimensional world Elias meticulously crafted within the confines of his small cubicle in the sprawling architectural firm of Blackwood & Sons.  Dust motes, illuminated by the harsh overhead lights, danced in the still air, each one a tiny, silent witness to the tireless work of a man whose dreams were built, one precise line at a time.
