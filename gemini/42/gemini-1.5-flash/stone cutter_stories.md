The wind, a rasping sigh against the granite cliffs, carried the scent of brine and distant woodsmoke.  It whipped Elias Thorne’s grey hair across his weathered face, stinging his eyes as he meticulously chipped away at the rough-hewn block before him.  The quarry, perched precariously on the edge of the world, seemed to hang suspended between the churning grey sea below and the bruised purple sky above.  Around Elias, the air vibrated with the rhythmic clang of his hammer against chisel, the only sound louder than the relentless cry of the gulls circling the jagged peaks.  For generations, the Thorns had worked this quarry, wresting beauty from the unforgiving stone, their legacy etched not just in the sculpted figures that graced churches and grand houses across the land, but in the very landscape itself – a testament to their enduring strength, as enduring as the granite itself.
