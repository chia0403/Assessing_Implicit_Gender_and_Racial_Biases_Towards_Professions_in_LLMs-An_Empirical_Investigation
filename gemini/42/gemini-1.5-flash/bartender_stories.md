The chipped Formica countertop felt cool beneath Elara Vance's fingertips as she meticulously polished a glass, the rhythmic swish of the cloth a counterpoint to the low hum of conversation in the dimly lit bar.  Rain lashed against the windows of "The Rusty Mug," blurring the neon glow of the city's skyline into a hazy watercolour.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of stale beer, spilled whiskey, and the faint, lingering sweetness of cheap perfume â€“ a familiar aroma that Elara, after ten years behind the bar, barely registered anymore. The only light came from the amber glow of the ceiling lamps and the flickering neon sign outside that advertised "Strong Drinks, Stronger Stories," a tagline Elara suspected was more accurate than the establishment's rather dubious liquor license would suggest. Tonight, however, the stories seemed particularly potent, hanging heavy in the air like the pre-storm humidity.
