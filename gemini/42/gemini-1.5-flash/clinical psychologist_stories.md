The chipped paint of Dr. Eleanor Vance's waiting room chair flaked onto the worn Persian rug, a silent testament to the building's age and, perhaps, its inhabitants' anxieties.  Rain lashed against the tall, gothic windows of the Blackwood Clinic, a relentless drumming that mirrored the frantic rhythm of Eleanor's own heart.  The air hung heavy with the scent of old paper, dust, and a faintly unsettling sweetness, like lilies left too long in a vase.  Outside, the November wind howled a mournful dirge through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks that guarded the clinic’s perimeter, their shadows stretching long and skeletal across the manicured lawn. Tonight, however, the shadows seemed to writhe with a malevolence that went beyond the usual autumnal gloom.  Eleanor, normally unflappable even in the face of her patients' most harrowing confessions, felt a prickle of unease she couldn't quite explain.  This wasn’t just a case of professional burnout; this was something deeper, colder.
