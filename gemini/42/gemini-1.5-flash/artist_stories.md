The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face, a familiar kiss from the unforgiving Atlantic.  He braced himself against the relentless wind, the biting chill a stark contrast to the vibrant hues exploding on his canvas.  Perched precariously on a jagged outcrop of rock, overlooking the churning grey expanse of the Dogger Bank, Elias worked with feverish intensity, his palette knife a frantic extension of his soul.  The fishing boats, tiny specks against the vastness, were mere suggestions of movement in his swirling, almost abstract depiction of the tempestuous sea.  Above, a bruised purple sky threatened further fury, mirroring the turmoil within the artist himself. This remote, windswept corner of Northumberland, a place where the land ended and the ocean began, had always been his sanctuary, a crucible where his emotions were forged into breathtaking, often unsettling, works of art.
