The air hung heavy with the scent of jasmine and impending rain, a perfume as thick and intoxicating as the humid Charleston air clinging to Elara Josephine Blackwood’s damp skin.  Elara, owner and sole proprietor of "Petals & Promises,"  stood amidst a riot of colour in her small, sun-drenched shop.  Orchids, their velvety petals a bruised plum and creamy white, leaned languidly against vibrant sunflowers, their faces turned towards the afternoon light.  The air thrummed with the low hum of the refrigerator keeping the lilies crisp and the gentle drip, drip, drip of a leaky tap somewhere in the back room, a counterpoint to the chirping of cicadas outside.  Rain threatened, promising to transform the already lush, overgrown courtyard behind the shop into a verdant, steamy jungle.  This was Charleston in July – beautiful, oppressive, and full of secrets whispered on the humid breeze.
