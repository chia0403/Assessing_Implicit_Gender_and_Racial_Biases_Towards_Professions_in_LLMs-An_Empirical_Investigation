The chipped porcelain mortar felt cool beneath Elara Vance’s fingertips, a familiar comfort in the chaotic symphony of the apothecary.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of sunlight slicing through the grime-coated windowpanes of Vance & Co., illuminating the shelves crammed with amber jars, dried herbs hanging in bunches like macabre floral arrangements, and the comforting scent of sandalwood and chamomile.  Outside, the cobblestones of Oakhaven’s High Street were slick with a late autumn rain, the muffled sounds of the town struggling through its daily rhythm a muted counterpoint to the quiet efficiency of Elara’s work.  She hummed a melancholic tune, the rhythm a counterpoint to the rhythmic grind of her pestle against the mortar, preparing a soothing balm for Mrs. Gable’s perpetually aching joints.  But the familiar routine couldn't quite mask the unsettling unease that had settled over Oakhaven like the clinging fog rolling in from the moor.  Something was wrong, something far more sinister than a simple case of rheumatism.
