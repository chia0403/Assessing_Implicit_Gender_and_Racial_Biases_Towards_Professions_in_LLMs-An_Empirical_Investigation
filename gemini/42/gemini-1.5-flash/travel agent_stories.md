The aroma of stale coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air, a familiar scent to Amelia Hernandez, travel agent extraordinaire (or at least, that's what her business cards claimed).

Amelia, slumped behind a desk piled high with brochures promising exotic escapes she could only dream of, sighed, the sound lost in the relentless drumming of the rain.  Today, the only escape in sight was another lukewarm cup of coffee.
