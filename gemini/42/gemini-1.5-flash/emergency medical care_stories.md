The siren’s wail, a banshee shriek tearing through the humid Louisiana night, was almost swallowed whole by the incessant chirping of cicadas.  Sweat beaded on Amelia Jean Dubois’s forehead, clinging to the already damp fabric of her EMT uniform.  The air, thick and heavy with the scent of honeysuckle and decaying vegetation, hung in the cramped ambulance cab, a stark contrast to the sterile chill of the hospital she’d left only minutes before.  Amelia Jean gripped the wheel of the aging Ford, its shocks protesting with every bump in the rutted dirt road that led deeper into the bayou.  Ahead, the beam of her headlights cut through the oppressive darkness, revealing only the skeletal branches of cypress trees, their gnarled fingers reaching out like grasping claws. This wasn't her first call out to the backwoods of Terrebonne Parish, but the urgency in the dispatcher's voice – the raw terror – had a chilling edge that sent a shiver down her spine. Tonight felt different.  Tonight felt… wrong.
