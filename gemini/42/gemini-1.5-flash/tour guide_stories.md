The midday sun beat down on Amelia Hernandez’s neck, the heat shimmering off the ochre-coloured stones of the ancient Roman amphitheatre.  Dust motes danced in the shafts of light filtering through the crumbling arches, illuminating the worn, graffiti-scarred walls.  Amelia, a wisp of a woman with fiery red hair usually confined in a practical braid but now escaping in unruly strands, adjusted the microphone clipped to her lapel.  The small group of tourists she was guiding – a gaggle of sun-baked faces and snapping cameras – shuffled restlessly in the oppressive heat, their murmurs a low hum against the cicadas' relentless chirping. This wasn't just any amphitheatre; this was the magnificent, almost perfectly preserved, Theatre of Marcellus in Rome, and Amelia, despite the heat and the inevitable grumbles, felt a familiar thrill course through her.  It was a thrill she experienced every time she stood within these ancient walls, a thrill only a true Romanophile could understand.
