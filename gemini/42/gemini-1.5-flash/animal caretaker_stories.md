The biting wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne's thick auburn braid across her face as she wrestled a recalcitrant bale of hay.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and pine, carried the faint, underlying aroma of animal musk – a familiar perfume in the sprawling, ramshackle sanctuary she called home: Whispering Pines Wildlife Refuge.  Nestled deep within the ancient redwood forest of northern California, the refuge was a patchwork of repurposed barns, cobbled-together enclosures, and winding, muddy trails, all overseen by Amelia and a small, dedicated team.  The setting sun cast long shadows across the uneven ground, painting the gnarled branches of the redwoods in fiery hues, a stark contrast to the grey, brooding sky that threatened further snow.  Tonight, however, Amelia’s focus was not on the impending storm, but on ensuring every creature under her care had enough to see them through the night.
