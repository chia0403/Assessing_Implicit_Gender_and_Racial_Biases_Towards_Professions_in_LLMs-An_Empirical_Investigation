The chipped paint of the "Guidance Counselor" sign seemed to mirror the cracks in Eleanor Vance's weary spirit.  Rain lashed against the window of her small, cluttered office at Northwood High, blurring the already indistinct view of the perpetually overcast sky.  The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and teenage angst – a familiar perfume that clung to the worn floral armchair where Eleanor usually sat, listening to the woes of the students who filed through her doorway.  Today, however, the chair remained unoccupied, the only sound louder than the drumming rain being the frantic scratching of her pen against the overflowing “to-do” list that threatened to spill onto the desk.  It wasn't the usual teenage dramas that burdened her this Monday morning; it was a silence, a chilling absence, that had settled over Northwood High like a shroud.  A silence that Eleanor Vance knew, with a growing dread in her stomach, meant something terrible had happened.
