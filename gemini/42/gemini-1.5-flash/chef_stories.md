The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of frying garlic and simmering spices, a fragrant curtain separating Chef Aurelia “Ria” Petrova from the chaos of the bustling Santorini kitchen.  Ria, a whirlwind of controlled energy in her crisp white chef’s jacket, expertly tossed a handful of sun-dried tomatoes into a bubbling pan of crimson ragu.  The Aegean Sea, a breathtaking panorama of sapphire and turquoise, stretched beyond the open kitchen windows, a stark contrast to the fiery heart of the restaurant, “Poseidon’s Table,” perched dramatically on the caldera’s edge.  The whitewashed walls, adorned with vibrant bougainvillea spilling from terracotta pots, offered little respite from the midday heat, yet the view – a postcard come to life – inspired a kind of serene intensity in Ria’s work.  Tonight, she was preparing for her most important dinner service yet: a private affair for a mysterious and demanding client, a dinner that could make or break her fledgling restaurant.
