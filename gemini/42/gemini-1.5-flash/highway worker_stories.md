The rasp of gravel under Dale’s boots was a familiar symphony, a counterpoint to the relentless drone of passing eighteen-wheelers on Interstate 40.  Dust, the colour of faded denim, swirled around his work boots as he leaned on his shovel, the Arizona sun beating down on his already sweat-soaked shirt.  The air shimmered with heat above the black asphalt, warping the distant mesas into hazy, ethereal silhouettes. Dale “Dusty” Rhodes, a man whose name seemed to have been chosen by the very landscape he worked, squinted at the horizon.  Another scorcher of a day in Winslow, Arizona, another day patching potholes and dodging impatient drivers – another day trying to keep the arteries of the American Southwest flowing.
