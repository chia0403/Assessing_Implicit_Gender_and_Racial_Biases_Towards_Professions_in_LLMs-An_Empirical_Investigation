The biting wind whipped at Silas Blackwood’s beard, a frozen waterfall of grey and white that mirrored the frosted pines clawing at the bruised twilight sky.  Silas, his breath misting in the frigid air, hauled another log onto the groaning sled, the rough-hewn wood biting into his calloused hands. The air tasted of pine needles, damp earth, and the faint, metallic tang of blood – a familiar scent in the unforgiving wilderness of the Cascade Mountains.
