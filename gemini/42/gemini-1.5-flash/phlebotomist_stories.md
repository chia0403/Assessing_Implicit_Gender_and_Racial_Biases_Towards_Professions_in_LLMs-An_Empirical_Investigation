The fluorescent lights of the Meadowbrook Medical Center hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* of Amelia Hernandez’s own pulse.  Amelia, a phlebotomist with hands as steady as a surgeon's and a smile that could disarm even the most needle-phobic patient, felt a prickle of unease crawl up her spine. It wasn’t the usual pre-shift jitters; this was different, a low thrum of apprehension that resonated deeper than the hospital's sterile scent of antiseptic and fear.  The early morning light, filtering weakly through the grimy windows of the phlebotomy lab, cast long shadows across the rows of neatly organized tubes, ampules, and bandages, highlighting the dust motes dancing in the stillness.  Today, something felt…off.  The usual cacophony of early morning activity – the clatter of gurneys, the hushed whispers of nurses, the distant beeping of heart monitors – was muted, replaced by an almost unsettling quiet.
