The chipped mug warmed Amelia Katherine Holloway’s hands, the lukewarm tea doing little to thaw the icy grip of the November air that seeped through the drafty window of her attic office.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single bare bulb hanging precariously above her head, danced in the weak light.  Amelia, a woman whose sharp gaze belied her perpetually tired eyes, sighed, the sound swallowed by the rustling of ancient manuscripts stacked haphazardly on every available surface.  Her office, perched atop the crumbling Victorian building that housed Holloway & Sons Publishers, wasn't exactly conducive to productivity, but it was hers – a chaotic sanctuary filled with the ghosts of countless stories, both published and rejected.  The scent of aged paper and binding glue hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma that spoke of decades of literary history.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune, a fitting soundtrack to the manuscript currently threatening to unravel Amelia’s already frayed nerves.
