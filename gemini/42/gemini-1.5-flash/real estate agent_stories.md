The relentless Florida sun beat down on Amelia Hernandez's shoulders, baking the already stifling air thick and heavy. Sweat beaded on her forehead, clinging to the stray strands of auburn hair that escaped her neat bun.  Amelia, a woman whose sharp business acumen was only surpassed by her equally sharp sense of style, adjusted the crisp white linen of her blazer, a small, almost imperceptible grimace twisting her lips.  This wasn’t how she’d envisioned her Tuesday morning.  Instead of the cool, climate-controlled interior of her swanky office at Premier Properties,  she found herself standing on the cracked, sun-bleached asphalt of a dilapidated driveway, surrounded by the overgrown jungle that was rapidly reclaiming this once-grand Victorian mansion in the heart of Coconut Grove. The air hung heavy not only with humidity but with the scent of decay – damp wood, mold, and something faintly floral, yet unsettlingly sharp, like a bruised jasmine.  This property, or rather, this *wreck*, was her latest challenge, and the commission, while substantial, might not be worth the potential nightmares.
