The recycled air hung thick and faintly metallic, a familiar perfume to Seraphina "Sera" Bellweather.  She adjusted her perfectly-pressed teal uniform, the tiny embroidered wings a stark contrast to the churning tempest outside.  Rain lashed against the windows of the Boeing 747, a furious drumming that threatened to drown out even the low hum of the engines.  Flight BA249, London Heathrow to Hong Kong, was already an hour behind schedule, and the pre-flight jitters of the passengers were starting to simmer into something far less palatable.  The cabin lights, dimmed for the pre-landing descent, cast long, wavering shadows, transforming the normally comforting interior into a claustrophobic labyrinth of anxious faces.  Outside, the grey expanse of the English Channel stretched below, a stormy mirror reflecting the growing unease Sera felt twisting in her own stomach. This wasn't just another delayed flight; something feltâ€¦ off.
