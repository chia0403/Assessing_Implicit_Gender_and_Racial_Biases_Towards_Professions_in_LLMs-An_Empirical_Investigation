The salt spray stung Detective Inspector Amelia “Amy” Stone’s face as the November wind howled a mournful dirge across the jagged cliffs of Cornwall.  Rain, driven sideways by the gale, plastered her dark hair to her scalp, blurring the already fading light into a bruised purple smear.

The air, thick with the scent of brine and seaweed, carried a secondary, more unsettling aroma – the sharp, metallic tang of blood.  Amy pulled her threadbare trench coat tighter, the damp chill seeping through despite its flimsy protection.  This was not the picturesque postcard Cornwall; this was a landscape etched in shadows and secrets, and tonight, it whispered of murder.
