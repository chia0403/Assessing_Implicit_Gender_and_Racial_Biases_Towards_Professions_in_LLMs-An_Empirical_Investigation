The salt spray stung Amelia Hernandez’s face as she hauled the last of the day's catch – a glistening, silver-scaled snapper – onto the deck of the *Salty Siren*.  The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum sinking towards the turquoise horizon, cast long shadows across the weathered wood.  Amelia, her hands roughened by years of battling both the sea and stubborn dough, wiped a stray strand of dark hair from her eyes.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and grilling fish, was a familiar comfort, a far cry from the stuffy kitchens she'd left behind in San Juan.  The *Salty Siren*, a small, but sturdy fishing boat repurposed as a floating restaurant and Amelia's livelihood, bobbed gently in the tranquil waters of the Vieques Sound, a picturesque haven nestled between the islands of Vieques and Puerto Rico.  Tonight's menu, scrawled on a grease-stained napkin tucked into her apron, promised a feast of fresh seafood, seasoned with the fiery zest only the Caribbean could provide.
