The scent of argan oil and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a perfume as familiar to Isabella “Izzy” Rodriguez as the rhythm of her own heartbeat.  Her salon, "Izzy's Locks & Lashes," nestled between a bustling bakery and a perpetually-empty storefront specializing in artisanal birdhouses, was a vibrant explosion of color.  Hot pink walls clashed delightfully with turquoise accents, while strands of shimmering, multi-hued hair extensions dangled from the ceiling like whimsical mobiles.  Today, however, the usually cheerful chaos was muted.  A thick, unsettling silence blanketed the salon, broken only by the rhythmic tick-tock of a vintage clock perched precariously on a stack of Vogue magazines, and the low hum of the air conditioning struggling against the August heat clinging stubbornly to the New Orleans air. Izzy, usually a whirlwind of activity, sat hunched over a steaming cup of café au lait, her usually vibrant eyes clouded with a worry that even the brightest fuchsia highlights couldn't mask.
