The brass spittoon glinted under the single, flickering gas lamp in the dimly lit corner of the Grand Majestic Hotel lobby.  Dust motes danced in the weak light, illuminating the worn, plush crimson carpet like constellations in a velvet night sky.  A faint scent of aged mahogany and pipe tobacco hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to twenty-two-year-old  Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, bellhop extraordinaire, or at least, that's what he aspired to be.  Tonight, however,  extraordinaire was a far cry from the reality of lugging a mountain of mismatched luggage for a particularly grumpy theatre troupe, their costumes spilling sequins and smelling faintly of stale beer and desperation.  The Grand Majestic, once a beacon of elegance, now felt more like a fading echo of its former glory, and Barty, along with its chipped paint and groaning elevators, was slowly succumbing to the same melancholy.
