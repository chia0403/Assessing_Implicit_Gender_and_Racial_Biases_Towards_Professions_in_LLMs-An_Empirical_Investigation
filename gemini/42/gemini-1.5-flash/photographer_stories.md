The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face, a familiar kiss from the unforgiving Atlantic.  He braced himself against the relentless wind whipping across the desolate cliffs of Cornwall, the biting air a stark contrast to the warmth radiating from his battered Leica M6 in his gloved hands.

The sky, a bruised purple bruised by the fading light of a November afternoon, mirrored the turbulent emotions churning within him. Elias, his breath misting in the frigid air, adjusted the focus, his gaze fixed on the lone, wind-battered lighthouse standing defiant against the elemental onslaught.
