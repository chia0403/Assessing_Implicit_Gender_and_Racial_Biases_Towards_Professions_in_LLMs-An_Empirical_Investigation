The fluorescent lights of the Zenith Tower hummed a monotonous tune, their sickly yellow glow reflecting off the polished granite floor.  Water, slick and smelling faintly of lemon and despair, clung to the freshly mopped tiles.  Elias Thorne, a man whose life seemed as grey and unremarkable as the concrete he polished every night, pushed his mop bucket with a weary sigh.  The cavernous lobby of the Zenith Tower, usually a bustling hive of expensive suits and hurried footsteps, was now a silent mausoleum, the echoes of the day's activity swallowed by the vastness of the space.  Only the rhythmic squeak of Elias's mop and the low thrum of the building's inner workings kept him company in the pre-dawn stillness.  Outside, the Chicago wind howled a mournful ballad, a counterpoint to the sterile calm of the skyscraper's interior.  Tonight, however, the usual calm was broken by a peculiar chill â€“ a sense of unease that even the relentless scrubbing couldn't quite wash away.
