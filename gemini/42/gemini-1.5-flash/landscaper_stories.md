The dawn broke grey and sullen over the manicured lawns of Oakhaven Estates, mirroring the mood of Elias Thorne, landscaper extraordinaire (or at least, that's what his business cards claimed).  Mist clung to the perfectly sculpted hedges, transforming them into ghostly, emerald sentinels guarding the opulent mansions that lined the cul-de-sac.  Elias, his breath puffing out in white clouds, wrestled a recalcitrant weed-whacker to life, the jarring sound a stark contrast to the otherwise pristine quiet of the upscale neighborhood.  The scent of damp earth and freshly cut grass mingled with the faint, almost imperceptible aroma of expensive perfume – a lingering ghost from last night's lavish party at the McGregors’ mansion, no doubt.  Today, however, Elias wasn't trimming roses; he was battling a much more sinister bloom.
