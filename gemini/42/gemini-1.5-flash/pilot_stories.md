The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful song around Captain Amelia "Amy" Stone's battered Cessna 185, its icy breath frosting the already-chilled plexiglass.  Below, the Chugach Mountains hunched like slumbering giants, their snow-capped peaks disappearing into a swirling vortex of grey and white.  The only visible landmarks were the jagged, skeletal remains of ancient spruce trees clawing at the sky, their gnarled branches burdened with a thick, unforgiving blanket of snow.  Amy checked her instruments one last time, the faint glow of the dials reflecting in her frost-rimmed goggles.  The radio crackled with static, a lonely counterpoint to the relentless wind.  This was no ordinary flight; this was a rescue mission, and the fate of a lone hiker, lost somewhere in this unforgiving wilderness, rested squarely on her shoulders.
