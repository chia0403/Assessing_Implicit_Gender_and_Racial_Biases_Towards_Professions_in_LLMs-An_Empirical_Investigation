## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The biting January wind howled through the shattered windows of the abandoned textile mill in Paterson, New Jersey. Snow, the dirty gray of exhaust fumes, swirled inside, dusting the rusting machinery and collapsing timbers. Graffiti artists had claimed the space long ago, their vibrant, chaotic murals clashing jarringly with the decay. The air hung thick with the acrid smell of wet cotton, mold, and something else… something burning.

**Story Opening:**

A cough racked Johnathan Michael O’Connell’s chest, the frigid air burning in his lungs. He pulled his oxygen mask tighter, the rubber digging into the bridge of his nose. The heat was intense, a living, breathing beast clawing at him even through his turnout gear. He blinked against the stinging smoke, his flashlight beam cutting through the oppressive darkness, illuminating a Dante-esque scene. Flames danced on the skeletal remains of weaving machines, licking greedily at the roof. He could hear the ominous creak and groan of collapsing support beams, a chilling symphony of destruction. “Engine 12, do you copy? I’m inside. We got heavy fire on the second floor, looks like it started near the old dye vats. Visibility is next to zero. Need backup… fast.” His voice was muffled by the mask, laced with a thread of urgency he couldn't quite conceal, even from himself. He tightened his grip on the nozzle, bracing himself for the inevitable backdraft. He knew, deep in his gut, that this wasn't just a simple, careless arson. Something felt wrong, terribly wrong, about this fire.
