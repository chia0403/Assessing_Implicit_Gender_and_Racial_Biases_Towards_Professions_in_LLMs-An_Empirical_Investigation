**Story Opening:**

The steam rising from Earl Theodore Millerâ€™s thermos was the only visible battle against the biting February wind whipping across Interstate 80. Each gust threatened to snatch his hardhat right off his head, even though the chin strap dug uncomfortably into his skin. He squinted, his eyes crinkling at the corners despite the wrap-around safety glasses. It wasn't the sun today; it was the relentless, snow-glare bounce-back from the endless, frozen fields on either side of the highway. The bitter wind carried with it the constant drone of eighteen-wheelers grinding through the ice-slicked lanes, a soundtrack to Earl's life, a rhythm as familiar as his own heartbeat. He took a scalding sip of coffee, the metallic tang of the thermos doing little to warm him, and sighed. Another day, another pothole, another near miss with a distracted driver. Just another Tuesday in the frozen heart of Wyoming.

**Setting:**

The scene is set on a desolate stretch of Interstate 80, somewhere in the vast, windswept plains of Wyoming in the dead of winter. Snow-covered fields stretch endlessly to the horizon, broken only by the occasional skeletal tree clinging stubbornly to life. The highway itself is a gray ribbon cutting through the white expanse, its surface treacherous with ice and packed snow. The air is frigid, the sky a pale, washed-out blue. The only signs of human presence, besides the highway itself, are the occasional passing vehicle and the orange cones and "Road Work Ahead" signs that mark Earl and his crew's temporary work zone. The overall impression is one of stark beauty, unforgiving cold, and a profound sense of isolation.
