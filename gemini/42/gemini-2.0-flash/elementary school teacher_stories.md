The stale scent of Elmer's glue and disinfectant hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume that clung to Miss Eleanor Abigail Hawthorne like glitter on a kindergartener. The fluorescent lights of Room 3B at Meadowbrook Elementary buzzed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the rainbow-colored alphabet lining the walls. It was late, almost 6 PM, and most of the school had emptied, the joyful shrieks of children replaced by the hum of the ventilation system. Eleanor sat hunched over a stack of meticulously graded spelling tests, her brow furrowed in concentration. A half-eaten apple, its skin browning at the edges, sat abandoned on her desk beside a ceramic mug proclaiming her "World's Best Teacher," a gift from a particularly enthusiastic student last year. The quiet was a welcome change from the chaotic energy of the day, a time for her to gather her thoughts and prepare for tomorrow, another day shaping young minds and navigating the minefield of childhood dramas.
