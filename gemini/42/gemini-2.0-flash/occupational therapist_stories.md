## Story Opening & Setting:

The incessant beeping drilled into Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Vance's skull, a soundtrack she’d come to associate with Thursdays. Thursday mornings meant Geriatric Rehab at St. Jude’s Mercy Hospital, a place where the smell of disinfectant hung heavier than the anxieties of its residents. Ellie, a meticulous and empathetic Occupational Therapist, adjusted her nametag, the plastic glinting under the fluorescent lights. Today, her first appointment was with Mr. Henderson, a recent stroke survivor, whose primary goal, according to his chart, was “to hold my damn coffee cup again.”

Ellie sighed, the sound swallowed by the sterile air. She loved her job, loved the small victories, the glimmers of hope she could coax from lives temporarily derailed. But days like today, steeped in the quiet despair of lost independence, were a heavy weight to carry. Stepping into the elevator, she pressed the button for the fourth floor, the doors sliding shut with a metallic groan, and the faint scent of lavender – the hospital's attempt at aromatherapy - did little to lighten the atmosphere. The journey upwards felt slow, each floor passing like a hurdle in a race she knew she couldn’t win for everyone.
