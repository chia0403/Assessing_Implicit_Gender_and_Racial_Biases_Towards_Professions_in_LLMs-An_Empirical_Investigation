The clatter of keys on the heavy ring echoed in the cavernous stillness of the St. Augustine University Library. Dust motes, disturbed by the hesitant beam of his flashlight, danced in the air like tiny, mischievous spirits. Tonight, like every other night, belonged to Silas Montgomery, and tonight, like most other nights, he felt the weight of its silence pressing down on him.

The library itself was a monument to hushed tones and forgotten knowledge. Built in 1908, the Neo-Gothic structure boasted towering ceilings supported by intricately carved oak columns. Rows upon rows of bookshelves, stained a deep, almost sorrowful brown, stretched into the shadows, their spines lined with gold-lettered titles that Silas had only ever glimpsed. Sunlight, during the day, streamed through stained-glass windows depicting scenes from ancient Greek philosophy, casting kaleidoscopic patterns on the worn Persian rugs. But at 11:00 PM, when Silas clocked in, the only light came from the flickering fluorescent tubes overhead, their hum a constant, low-level drone that amplified the feeling of being utterly, utterly alone in a place that contained the accumulated wisdom of centuries. The faint scent of aging paper and leather permeated the air, a comforting aroma that had become as familiar to Silas as the back of his own hand.

Tonight, the east wing, dedicated to the history and literature of the American South, was his territory. And tonight, Silas Montgomery, custodian of the hallowed halls of St. Augustine, was about to find something far more interesting than dust bunnies and stray coffee stains.
