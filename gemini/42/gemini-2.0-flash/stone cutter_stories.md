The wind howled a mournful dirge through the narrow, cobbled streets of Aethelburg, a town built precariously onto the side of Mount Cinder. Slate roofs, dark and glistening with perpetual damp, huddled together like worried sheep. Even on clear days, the sun struggled to penetrate the perpetual twilight that reigned in the lower reaches, where the houses clung to the mountain's flank like limpets to a rock. The air, thick with the smell of damp stone and woodsmoke, always carried a faint tremor, a reverberation from the fiery heart that slumbered deep within the mountain. This was a place where legends were whispered, and the very ground seemed to breathe with ancient secrets.

The rhythmic clang of his hammer against the chisel echoed through the alleyway, a counterpoint to the mournful wind. Dust, fine as powdered bone, clung to his beard and matted his thick, dark hair. Sweat streamed down his face, etching clean paths through the grime. Magnus paused, wiped his brow with a calloused hand, and glared at the granite. It was a particularly stubborn piece, resisting his efforts to coax forth the likeness of a grieving widow. The commission was for a grave marker, a common request in a town so close to a perilous mountain and susceptible to sudden, earth-shattering tremors. But this granite, he sensed, held more than just stubbornness; it held a secret, a whisper of something he couldn't quite decipher. And Magnus Thorne, more than just a stone cutter, was a man who listened to the secrets the stones held.
