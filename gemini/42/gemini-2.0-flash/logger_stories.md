Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a logger character, focusing on atmosphere and a hint of conflict:

**Story Opening & Setting**

The wind howled a mournful song through the Douglas firs, a song Bartholomew Silas Keegan knew intimately. It was the sound of the old forest breathing its last, a sound that used to fill him with a wild, primal energy, but now just echoed the hollowness in his own chest. He spat a stream of tobacco juice into the thick carpet of pine needles and dirt, the acidic spittle disappearing almost instantly into the damp earth.

Bartholomew, or Bart as most folks called him, even if he preferred Silas, adjusted the thick wool scarf around his neck, the itchy wool doing little to stem the chill that seemed to seep straight from the ground. He'd been logging these woods his entire life, starting as a boy practically glued to his father’s side, learning the bite of the axe and the roar of the chainsaw like a second language. The Keegan name was synonymous with timber in the Redwood County, and for generations they had felled these trees, provided for their families, and built their legacy on the sweat and grit of their labor.

But things were changing. The timber was getting harder to find, the quotas were tighter than ever, and the whispers of preservationists, tree-huggers, as Bart called them, were growing louder, like a gathering storm brewing on the horizon. He glanced towards the freshly marked trees, each one bearing a red ‘X,’ a death sentence in the eyes of the forest. Today’s work felt different, heavier. Bart wasn't just taking timber, he was taking something that felt irreplaceable, something his grandfather and his grandfather's grandfather had taught him to respect, even as he cut it down. He sighed, the puff of breath a momentary ghost in the frigid air. He knew this forest, every ridge and ravine. He knew its secrets. And he had a feeling it was about to give one up.

**Setting:**

The story takes place in the dense, ancient forests of Redwood County, Northern California, likely in the early to mid 1990s. The area is characterized by towering redwood trees, interspersed with Douglas firs and other evergreens. The climate is damp and cool, with frequent fog and rain, particularly during the fall and winter months. Logging is a major industry in the area, and the community is largely comprised of loggers and their families. There's a distinct tension between the economic needs of the logging industry and the growing environmental movement pushing for conservation. The setting is both beautiful and harsh, reflecting the lives of the people who depend on it.
