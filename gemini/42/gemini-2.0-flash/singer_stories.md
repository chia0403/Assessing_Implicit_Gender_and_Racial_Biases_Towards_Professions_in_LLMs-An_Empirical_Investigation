Okay, here's a story opening and setting focusing on a singer named:

**Story Opening:**

The air in the Blue Moon Saloon hung thick with anticipation, a heady mix of cheap whiskey and desperation.  Spotlights, rigged slightly askew, painted a lurid wash of crimson and sapphire across the cracked, lacquered stage.  A nervous twitch pulled at the corner of Evangeline Magnolia Bellweather's mouth.  She adjusted the single, oversized rhinestone on her microphone, its cold touch grounding her slightly.  Behind her, Earl, her grizzled drummer, gave a reassuring nod, the faint scent of his aftershave – a cloying lilac – drifting forward.  Tonight wasn't just another gig.  Tonight, she was singing for him. Tonight, she was singing for a chance. Tonight, Evangeline Magnolia Bellweather was praying her voice would finally be enough.  The hum of the amps intensified, a low thrumming beneath the boisterous chatter of the crowd. Evangeline closed her eyes, took a shaky breath, and remembered what her Mama used to say: "Baby girl, a diamond shines best when its been buried deep." She just hoped the grit and pressure had finally forged something worth showing off.

**Setting:**

The story primarily takes place in the **Blue Moon Saloon**, a dive bar located on the outskirts of **New Orleans, Louisiana, in the year 1957**.

*   **The Blue Moon Saloon:** This isn't the French Quarter's polished, tourist-friendly nightlife. The Blue Moon is a gritty, low-ceilinged establishment with sticky floors, mismatched furniture, and a stage that's seen better days. It caters to a local crowd of longshoremen, hustlers, dreamers, and those who've simply lost their way. The walls are lined with faded posters of blues legends and pin-up girls, and the air is perpetually filled with the smell of stale beer and cigarette smoke. It's a place where secrets are whispered, deals are made, and hopes are momentarily kept alive by the music.

*   **The Outskirts of New Orleans:** This particular area is a blend of industrial docks, dilapidated housing, and overgrown marshland. The city's vibrant culture feels distant, replaced by a sense of neglect and isolation. The humidity hangs heavy, and the nights are filled with the sounds of crickets, distant foghorns, and the mournful wail of trains. It is a place of struggle and resiliance.

**Further notes on Evangeline Magnolia Bellweather:**

*   She is in her early twenties.
*   She dresses in a style that's both vintage and slightly worn, reflecting her limited means but her inherent sense of style. Think thrift-store finds mixed with hand-me-downs.
*   Her voice is her greatest asset - soulful, powerful, and capable of conveying a wide range of emotions.
*   She dreams of escaping the Blue Moon and making it big in the music world.

I hope this is a good starting point! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments.
