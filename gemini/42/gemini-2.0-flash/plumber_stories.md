The air in Mrs. Higgins' kitchen hung thick with the pungent aroma of rotten cabbage and desperation. A single, sputtering bulb cast harsh light on the scene: a woman with tear-streaked mascara and a lake of soapy water rapidly expanding across her linoleum floor. Frederick Theodore Flannery, a man built like a slightly dented refrigerator, sighed. He adjusted his tool belt, the metal clanking a mournful song in the otherwise silent chaos. "Right then, Mrs. Higgins," he said, his voice a gravelly balm against her hysteria. "Let's have a look at this monstrous blockage, shall we?"

The setting was a cramped, slightly dilapidated council flat in the heart of "The Borough," a section of South London perpetually shrouded in a grey film of drizzle and the faint scent of deep-fried everything. Mrs. Higgins' flat, number 7B, was a testament to a life lived close to the bone. Faded floral wallpaper peeled at the corners, revealing layers of past lives and questionable decorating choices. A chipped ceramic cat stood guard on the windowsill, watching over a courtyard filled with overflowing bins and the occasional stray pigeon. This was Frederick's bread and butter, the clogged arteries of a city he knew intimately, and usually, he could handle anything The Borough threw his way. But something about this particular situation, the almost palpable despair clinging to the air, made Frederick feel a knot of unease tighten in his gut. This wasn't just a blocked sink. This feltâ€¦ different.
