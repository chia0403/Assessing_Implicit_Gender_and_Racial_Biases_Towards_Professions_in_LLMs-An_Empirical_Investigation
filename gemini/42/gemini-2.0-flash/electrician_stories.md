The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, stinging Franklin Daniel Peterson’s cheeks as he wrestled with the recalcitrant fuse box. The air, thick with the smell of brine and decaying leaves, made his eyes water, blurring the already faded numbers etched beside the breakers. He cursed under his breath, a low, guttural sound lost to the roar of the waves crashing against the concrete pier.

Franklin was perched precariously on a wobbly stepladder in the dimly lit alcove of the North Point Lighthouse, a sentinel of brick and faded paint that had stood watch over Milwaukee harbor for almost two centuries. The alcove, tucked away behind the spiraling staircase, was damp and musty, smelling of old wood and something akin to rusted pennies. Cobwebs, thick as cotton candy, clung to the bare bulbs strung haphazardly across the ceiling, casting long, dancing shadows that played tricks on his eyes.

He’d been called in by the perpetually flustered lighthouse caretaker, Mrs. Agnes Periwinkle, who claimed the entire east side of the lighthouse had “gone dark as a pirate’s soul.” Franklin suspected it was just a blown fuse, likely caused by the ancient electric kettle Mrs. Periwinkle insisted on using, but a job was a job. And besides, he always found a strange sort of peace amidst the aging grandeur of the lighthouse, a quiet solitude that was a welcome respite from the relentless demands of his usual clients. It was a place where the ghosts of sailors past seemed to linger in the air, whispering tales of storms weathered and seas conquered, and tonight, Franklin felt an odd kinship with them. He just hoped he could conquer this damn fuse box before Mrs. Periwinkle started telling him about her "special relationship" with the lighthouse's resident ghost again.
