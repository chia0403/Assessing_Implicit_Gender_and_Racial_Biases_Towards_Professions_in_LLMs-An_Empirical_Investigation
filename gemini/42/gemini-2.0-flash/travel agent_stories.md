## Story Opening:

The insistent jingle of the seashell wind chimes outside Travel the World beckoned Mrs. Gable for the fifth time that morning, but Eleanor Victoria Ramsey resolutely ignored it. She preferred the gentle hum of the climate control and the faint scent of lavender sachets tucked strategically amongst the brochures. Outside, the midday Florida heat was a simmering beast, and Eleanor, with her penchant for floral dresses and sensible shoes, was not one to be trifled with by the beast. 

She tapped a perfectly manicured nail against a glossy photograph of the Eiffel Tower, her expression bordering on the contemplative. Not contemplative in the "I'm pondering the meaning of life" way, but more in the "I'm trying to remember if Madame Dubois always insists on a room with a view" way. Travel was, after all, about details. It was about creating the perfect experience, crafting a memory so vivid it would linger on the tongue like fine wine. And Madame Dubois, while a lovely woman, had a memory like a sieve and a palate for only the finest Bordeaux. Eleanor couldn't afford to make mistakes. Her reputation, and the steady stream of retirement accounts funding exotic cruises, depended on it.

Just as she was about to reach for the Madame's file, the seashell chimes announced yet another hopeful soul seeking escape. Eleanor straightened her floral-printed scarf, took a deep breath filled with lavender and the quiet desperation of middle-aged wanderlust, and pasted on her most charming smile. "Travel the World, how may I whisk you away today?"

## Setting:

Eleanor's travel agency, "Travel the World," is located in a small, sun-drenched strip mall in the coastal town of Cedar Key, Florida. The exterior is painted a cheerful, if slightly faded, turquoise, a colour chosen with the explicit intention of evoking the Caribbean Sea. The inside is a haven of air-conditioned tranquility, a stark contrast to the humid heat outside.

The walls are plastered with travel posters featuring exotic locales: the snow-capped Alps, the bustling streets of Tokyo, the serene beaches of Bali. Lush potted ferns hang from the ceiling, creating a sense of lushness and escape. A large, antique globe sits in the corner, silently inviting visitors to spin it and dream.

Eleanor's desk is a carefully curated oasis of order. No clutter is allowed. Brochures are neatly stacked and categorized, pens are lined up precisely, and a small silver frame holds a picture of her and her late husband, Harold, on their honeymoon in Venice. The overall atmosphere is one of comfortable elegance, a promise that here, at Travel the World, your travel dreams will be handled with care, precision, and a healthy dose of floral-scented optimism.
