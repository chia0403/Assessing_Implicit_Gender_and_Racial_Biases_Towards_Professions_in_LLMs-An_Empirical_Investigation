The scent of old lavender and simmering despair clung to 14 Willow Creek like a persistent fog. Patricia Eleanor Abernathy, Patricia to her clients, Ellie to the (increasingly rare) friends who remembered her fondness for the moniker, pulled her perpetually damp scarf tighter around her neck and shivered, despite the faux cheerfulness plastered on her face. This was it, the infamous Blackwood Manor, whispered about in hushed tones at the local Rotary Club and shunned by every other sane real estate agent in Cedar Creek.

Cedar Creek, nestled in the perpetually overcast foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, was a town steeped in tradition, gossip, and the kind of slow, deliberate charm that could curdle into something truly unsettling given the right circumstances. Those circumstances, Patricia feared, were brewing nicely at 14 Willow Creek. The Manor stood on a slight rise overlooking the town, its gothic architecture looming against the perpetually grey sky like a skeletal finger pointing accusingly at the world below. The overgrown ivy, choking the stone walls, resembled grasping claws, and the leaded glass windows, grimy with years of neglect, stared blankly ahead like empty eyes.

Patricia had taken the listing out of desperation. Sales were abysmal, her reputation was teetering on the edge of "washed-up," and her estranged daughter, Lily, was starting to ask pointed questions about college funds. The previous real estate agent, a young, ambitious woman named Sarah Miller, had vanished without a trace a few weeks ago, leaving behind only a frantic voicemail about "shadows" and "something in the walls." Everyone, including the police, attributed it to stress and a potential runaway situation. Patricia wasn't so sure. She had a feeling, a cold, creeping sensation that settled deep in her bones, that Blackwood Manor held secrets darker than just faded wallpaper and leaky pipes. And Patricia Eleanor Abernathy, for better or worse, was about to uncover them.
