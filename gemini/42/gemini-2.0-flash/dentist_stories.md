Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a dentist named Dr. Eleanor Maeve Sterling:

**Setting:** A crisp, late October evening in the small, picturesque town of Havenwood, nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. The air is thick with the scent of woodsmoke and decaying leaves, and strings of twinkly orange lights adorn the storefronts along Main Street, preparing for the annual Harvest Festival. Eleanor's dental practice, "Sterling Smiles," occupies a cozy Victorian building on the corner of Oak Street and Maple Avenue. A large, hand-painted sign featuring a cartoon molar wearing a jaunty top hat hangs above the entrance.

**Opening:**

The high-pitched whine of the dental drill finally fell silent, replaced by a gentle, almost imperceptible hum. Dr. Eleanor Maeve Sterling, her brow furrowed in concentration, carefully dabbed at the newly filled cavity in Mrs. Higgins' molars. The fluorescent light of the operatory glinted off her short, auburn hair, a stark contrast to the pastel floral wallpaper she’d stubbornly refused to update since inheriting the practice from her grandfather. "Alright, Mrs. Higgins, just a quick rinse now." Eleanor's voice was soothing, practiced, the kind of voice that could calm even the most anxious patients. Mrs. Higgins gurgled obligingly into the small paper cup, her dentures rattling slightly against the porcelain. Eleanor, however, wasn't paying attention to the sound. Her gaze was fixed on the swirling, crimson sunset visible through the frosted window, a sudden, unfamiliar disquiet settling in her stomach. It wasn’t just the approaching Halloween season, with its inherent creepiness, that was setting her on edge. Something felt… different in Havenwood tonight. Something unsettling, like the metallic tang of blood just after you accidentally nick your tongue. And she had a feeling it had nothing to do with her patients' teeth.
