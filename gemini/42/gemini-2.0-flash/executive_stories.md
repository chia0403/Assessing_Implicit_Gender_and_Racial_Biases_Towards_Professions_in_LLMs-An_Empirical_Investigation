Rain lashed against the panoramic window of Amelia Hawthorneâ€™s 47th-floor office at Hawthorne Enterprises. It was a fitting backdrop, she thought, to the storm brewing both outside and within. Amelia, CEO of the company her grandfather had built from the ground up, tapped her manicured fingers on the gleaming mahogany desk, the sound barely audible over the rhythmic drumming of the downpour. Below, the city of New Ashland sprawled, a shimmering tapestry of light blurred by the sheets of water. Tonight, it looked less like a beacon of innovation and more like a drowning metropolis, reflecting the turbulent state of her own empire.

Her reflection stared back, a ghost in the glass. At 38, Amelia should have felt invincible. Instead, the weight of responsibility pressed down on her, etched into the subtle lines forming around her steel-grey eyes. A half-empty glass of amber liquid sat abandoned beside a stack of quarterly reports that painted a grim picture. Hawthorne Enterprises, a titan of renewable energy technology, was hemorrhaging money. And if the whispers were true, someone within her inner circle was actively trying to sink the ship.
