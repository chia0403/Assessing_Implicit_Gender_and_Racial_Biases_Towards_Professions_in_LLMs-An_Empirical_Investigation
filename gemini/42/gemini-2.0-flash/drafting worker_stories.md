The fluorescent lights hummed, a monotonous counterpoint to the scratching of Edgar Arthur Pendelton's rapid pencil across the vellum. It was 2:17 AM, according to the institutional clock bolted to the cinderblock wall. Outside, the pre-dawn sky over Akron, Ohio, was a bruised purple, promising another sweltering summer day. But inside the monolithic concrete shell of the Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company's design department, time held a different, more tedious rhythm.

Edgar, a man more comfortable with precise measurements than idle chatter, meticulously rendered a cross-section of the new "Super Cushion" tire. He traced the intricate layers of rubber and steel cord with the practiced ease of a man who'd spent the last twenty-seven years of his life breathing in the scent of ammonia-based blueprints and listening to the clatter of adding machines. His desk, a sprawling battlefield of triangles, T-squares, and eraser shavings, was his sanctuary, his domain in a world that seemed increasingly noisy and chaotic. The only other sound, besides the hum and the scratching, was the occasional creak of the ancient, green linoleum floor as the night watchman shuffled past, his flashlight beam cutting through the gloom, a fleeting reminder of the life that existed beyond the drafting room walls. Edgar barely registered it, lost as he was in the satisfying precision of his lines, each one a testament to his meticulous nature and a desperate attempt to bring order to the sprawling, rubbery chaos of the world.
