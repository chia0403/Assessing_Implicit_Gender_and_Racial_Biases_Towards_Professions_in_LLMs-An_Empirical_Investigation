## Story Opening:

The humid Florida air hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine and, less appealingly, the chemical tang of weed killer. David Michael Flores wiped the sweat from his brow with the back of his calloused hand, leaving a streak of dirt across his forehead. He squinted up at the palatial, Spanish-style mansion, its terracotta roof gleaming under the relentless midday sun. Another day, another obscenely wealthy homeowner demanding perfection.

The "Tropical Paradise Redesign" project was a doozy. Mrs. Vandergelt, a woman who could make a Venus flytrap seem subtle, had demanded a landscape worthy of a magazine cover, something that screamed "old money" and "exotic getaway" simultaneously. David sighed, the low hum of his hedge trimmer vibrating against his ribs. He was damn good at his job, turning barren patches of land into vibrant oases, but sometimes, the sheer excess of it all was enough to make him want to pack up his tools and move back north.

He glanced at the meticulously drawn blueprints spread out on the hood of his battered Ford Ranger, the vibrant renderings mocking the reality of the overgrown mess he was facing. Giant Bird of Paradise plants needed relocating, an entire bed of impatiens had to be swapped for drought-resistant succulents (apparently, water restrictions were "so gauche"), and the entire irrigation system needed to be recalibrated to accommodate Mrs. Vandergelt's "exacting specifications." David took a deep breath, the jasmine fighting a losing battle against the gasoline fumes. Time to get to work.

## Setting:

**Location:** The fictional, affluent coastal town of "Seahaven Palms, Florida," situated about an hour south of Sarasota.

**Specific Setting:** The sprawling, immaculately manicured grounds of "Casa de las Flores," a newly purchased Spanish-style mansion owned by Mrs. Penelope Vandergelt, a wealthy socialite with a penchant for extravagant landscaping. The grounds feature a mixture of native Florida vegetation and imported exotic plants, all struggling to coexist under the unforgiving Florida sun. The overall atmosphere is one of opulent wealth and meticulous, almost obsessive, attention to detail.
