## Story Opening and Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The shriek was high-pitched, almost canine, and it punched through the static like a shard of ice through thin glass. Amelia Rose Thorne winced, instinctively pulling the headphones away from her ears. It wasn't feedback, not the usual hum and crackle that plagued the aging equipment in the lighthouse. This was… something else. Something distinctly *wrong*. Her fingers, perpetually stained with flux and bearing the faint aroma of burnt solder, danced across the dials of the radio transmitter, desperately trying to pinpoint the origin of the agonizing noise. Outside, the wind howled a mournful song, mirroring the unsettling dissonance she was now battling within the airwaves. This wasn't just a glitch. Amelia knew it in her bones.

**Setting:**

The story is set on **Puffin Isle**, a remote, windswept island off the coast of the **Shetland Islands, Scotland**, in the year **1968**. The primary location is the **St. Ninian’s Lighthouse**, a stark white tower that stands as a lonely sentinel against the perpetually grey sky. The lighthouse is not fully automated; a single caretaker, Amelia Rose Thorne, is responsible for maintaining the light and the radio communications that connect the island to the mainland.

The interior of the lighthouse is cramped but functional. The lamp room at the top is dominated by the massive Fresnel lens, casting its rhythmic beam across the turbulent waters. Below, living quarters consist of a small kitchen, a sparsely furnished bedroom, and the radio room, which is Amelia’s domain. The radio room is a chaotic jumble of wires, vacuum tubes, soldering irons, and half-disassembled equipment. Maps of the surrounding waters, peppered with handwritten notes and navigation markings, cover the walls. The air is thick with the smell of ozone and the ever-present hum of electricity. Outside, the island itself is a harsh but beautiful landscape of windswept cliffs, rocky beaches, and sparse vegetation, dominated by the cries of seabirds and the ceaseless roar of the ocean.
