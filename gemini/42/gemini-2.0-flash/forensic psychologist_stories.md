**Setting:** The suffocating humidity of Savannah, Georgia, in late July. Spanish moss hangs heavy from ancient oak trees, dripping moisture onto the cracked sidewalks. The air smells of salt, decay, and magnolias, a heady, unsettling mix. The sun beats down mercilessly, turning the cobblestone streets into shimmering mirages. The building itself is a grand, decaying antebellum mansion, its white paint peeling and chipped, revealing layers of history and neglect. This is the Savannah State Penitentiary, a relic of a bygone era, now repurposed as a temporary holding facility for the overflow from the county jail.

**Opening:**

Dr. Elara Vivian Hayes stepped out of her air-conditioned rental car, the blast of Savannah heat hitting her like a physical blow. She winced, pushing her dark hair back from her forehead, already damp. The wrought-iron gates of the Savannah State Penitentiary loomed before her, gothic and imposing. Even from here, she could hear the muffled shouts and cries emanating from within the ancient walls. Elara took a deep breath, adjusting her tailored linen suit. It was a futile attempt to maintain professionalism in this sweltering heat, but appearances mattered. She was here to assess a potential monster, and first impressions, unfortunately, went both ways. She presented her credentials to the guard at the gate, his gaze lingering a little too long. "Dr. Hayes," he grunted, his voice thick with a Southern drawl. "They're expectin' you. Down the hall, third door on the left. Warden Calhoun's waitin'." The heavy gates creaked open, and Elara stepped into the heart of the darkness. Today, she was entering the mind of a killer. And in Savannah, where the past never truly died, she had a feeling this case would be more complicated than she anticipated.
