## Story Opening:

The scent of lavender and stale coffee hung heavy in the air of her office, a strange, unsettlingly comforting combination that only she, Dr. Eleanor Vance, seemed to notice. Eleanor sat hunched over a stack of college applications, the fluorescent lights buzzing overhead like angry bees. She rubbed her tired eyes, the faint crinkle lines at the corners deepening. Another Friday afternoon, another mountain of paperwork, another wave of existential teenage angst threatening to engulf her.

The intercom buzzed, a shrill, demanding sound that made Eleanor wince. She sighed, pushing the applications aside with a practiced weariness. "Vance here," she said, her voice already laced with the soothing calmness she reserved for moments like these.

"Dr. Vance, you're needed in the reception area. We have a...visitor. Says it's urgent and refuses to speak to anyone else." Mrs. Davies, the school secretary, sounded flustered, a rare occurrence.

Eleanor’s stomach clenched. Urgent visits on a Friday afternoon rarely heralded good news. She straightened her slightly rumpled cardigan, smoothed a stray strand of her auburn hair, and took a deep breath. Ready or not, another crisis awaited.

## Setting:

The story is set in the small, seemingly idyllic town of Willow Creek, nestled in the rolling hills of upstate New York. Specifically, the opening takes place in the **Guidance Counseling office of Willow Creek High School.**

The office itself is a study in controlled chaos. Eleanor has tried to create a calming atmosphere with soft lighting, a plush rug in a soothing shade of teal, and strategically placed plants. However, the walls are covered with motivational posters that feel increasingly hollow, and the overflowing bookshelves groan under the weight of college guides, scholarship applications, and dog-eared copies of "What Color is Your Parachute?".

The room is small, cramped even, dominated by Eleanor's large oak desk, which is perpetually buried under piles of paperwork. A comfortable armchair sits in front of the desk, intended to provide a safe space for students to confide in her. The overall impression is one of well-intentioned effort struggling against the relentless tide of teenage problems. Outside, the sounds of students preparing for the weekend – slamming lockers, excited chatter, the distant thrum of a school bus engine – provide a constant, almost taunting contrast to the anxieties brewing within the office walls.
