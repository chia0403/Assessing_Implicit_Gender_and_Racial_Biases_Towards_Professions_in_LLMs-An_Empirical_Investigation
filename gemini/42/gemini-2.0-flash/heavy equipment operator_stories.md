The biting wind whipped across the vast, scarred landscape of the Mesabi Iron Range, stinging Evelyn "Ev" McKinley's cheeks and tugging at the brim of her hardhat. The pre-dawn sky was a bruised purple, barely hinting at the fiery orange that would soon claw its way over the horizon. Ev took a long pull from her thermos, the lukewarm coffee doing little to chase away the chill that had settled deep in her bones.

Her domain was a behemoth: a P&H 4100XPC electric rope shovel, its bucket capable of scooping up seventy cubic yards of taconite ore in a single bite. It loomed over the pit like a metallic dinosaur, its cables humming with pent-up energy. From her perch in the operator's cab, high above the dust and the rumble of the diesel trucks, Ev could see for miles across the sprawling Hibbing mine. Patches of snow clung to the benches of the open pit, stark against the rust-red earth and the dark, shimmering pools of water that collected in the lower levels. It was a landscape born of relentless excavation, a testament to the hunger of the steel industry, and Ev McKinley was one of its key players.
