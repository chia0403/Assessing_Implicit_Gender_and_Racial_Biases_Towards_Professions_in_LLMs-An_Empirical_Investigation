Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a florist as the main character:

**Story Opening:**

The scent of lilies and damp earth clung to Annelise Marguerite Dubois like a second skin. It was a scent she welcomed, a familiar comfort in the chaotic whirlwind that was her life and, more specifically, "Annelise's Artful Blooms," her tiny flower shop nestled on Rue des Rosiers in the heart of the Marais district of Paris. Today, however, even the comforting aroma couldn't quite soothe the sharp knot of anxiety twisting in her stomach. A notification pinged on her ancient, flower-stickered phone. It was the weekly reminder from her grandmother, Mémé Odette: "Remember, chérie, the past is a garden. Tend it with love, but don't let it choke the present." Annelise sighed, a puff of air that momentarily ruffled the delicate petals of a nearby blush-pink peony. Easy for Mémé to say, she thought, as she glanced out the window at the rain-slicked cobblestones. Mémé's past hadn't involved a cryptic, anonymous note slipped into a bouquet of freesias, threatening to uproot everything Annelise had carefully cultivated.

**Setting:**

The story is set in the Marais district of Paris, specifically on Rue des Rosiers. Annelise's shop, "Annelise's Artful Blooms," is a small, charming space overflowing with color and fragrance. The walls are painted a soft, antique white, and vintage floral wallpaper peeks out in certain sections.  Shelves overflow with vases, ribbons, and gardening tools. Buckets of freshly cut flowers in every hue imaginable line the walls, creating a vibrant and chaotic, yet undeniably beautiful, scene.  The air is always heavy with the scent of blooms, a heady mix of roses, lilies, lavender, and the sharp, green tang of foliage.  Outside, the narrow street is bustling with tourists and locals alike, a constant hum of conversation and the clatter of delivery bikes. The shop's large window, usually showcasing Annelise's latest floral creations, offers a glimpse into the vibrant life of the Marais – the bustling cafes, the historic architecture, and the constant parade of people from all walks of life.
