## Story Opening:

The low hum of the air conditioner was a paltry shield against the oppressive August heat seeping through the closed blinds of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office. It was a Thursday, typically a heavy day, but after Mrs. Petrov, Eleanor had a blessedly empty hour. She leaned back in her worn leather armchair, the springs groaning a familiar complaint, and rubbed the bridge of her nose. A headache, a slow, throbbing ache, was building behind her eyes. She considered making tea, but the thought of moving, of summoning even that small amount of energy, felt overwhelming.

Instead, she closed her eyes, trying to conjure the scent of the ocean. She hadn't been to the beach in months. Usually, the rhythmic crash of waves and the salty air were enough to reset her, to wash away the anxieties and traumas she absorbed daily from her patients. Today, however, the mental imagery felt… muted. Even the imagined cry of a seagull sounded flat, lifeless.

A sharp knock on her door startled her. Eleanor frowned. Her receptionist, Janice, knew better than to interrupt her between appointments unless it was an emergency.

"Come in," she sighed, the word barely audible.

Janice peeked her head in, her brow furrowed with a concern that immediately ratcheted up Eleanor's anxiety. "Dr. Vance," she said, her voice hushed, "there's a… a gentleman here to see you. He doesn't have an appointment, but he insists it's urgent. He wouldn't tell me his name, and he keeps looking out the window like he's expecting someone." Janice chewed her lip nervously. "He gives me the creeps, to be honest."

Eleanor’s headache intensified. Just what she needed. "Did you tell him I don't see walk-ins?"

"I did, Dr. Vance. But he just… stared at me. And said, 'Dr. Eleanor Vance is expecting me.' It gave me chills." Janice shivered theatrically.

Eleanor sighed. Sometimes, the line between sanity and insanity was thinner than she liked to admit, and today, it felt particularly precarious. "Alright, Janice. I'll see him. Give me a moment to… compose myself."

Janice nodded gratefully and retreated, leaving Eleanor alone with the unsettling anticipation of what was about to walk through her door. She straightened her navy blazer, smoothed down her auburn hair, and took a deep breath. Time to put on her professional face. Whatever "it" was, she would handle it. She always did.

## Setting:

Dr. Eleanor Vance's office is located in a pre-war brownstone in the affluent, yet quietly aging, neighborhood of Brooklyn Heights in New York City. The building itself is elegant, with ornate cornices and a faded grandeur, a testament to a bygone era.

Inside, Eleanor's office is a study in comfortable functionality. The walls are painted a calming, neutral beige. A floor-to-ceiling bookshelf dominates one wall, overflowing with psychology textbooks, novels, and framed photographs of Eleanor's family and travels. A large, comfortable leather armchair sits opposite a slightly less imposing, but equally comfortable, couch. A small antique Persian rug adds a touch of warmth to the otherwise muted color scheme.

The room is deliberately designed to be a safe and welcoming space, a sanctuary from the outside world. However, the cracks in the plaster, the slightly worn edges of the furniture, and the persistent hum of the aging air conditioner hint at the hidden pressures and burdens that weigh on both the therapist and her practice. The overall atmosphere is one of quiet, almost melancholic, professionalism.
