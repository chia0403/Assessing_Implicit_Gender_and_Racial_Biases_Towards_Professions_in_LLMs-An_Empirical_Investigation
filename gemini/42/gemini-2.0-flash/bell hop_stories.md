Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a bellhop named Alistair Humphrey Finch:

**Setting:**

The Grand Majestic Hotel, nestled in the heart of New Orleans' French Quarter, buzzed with a chaotic, yet opulent, energy. The air, thick with humidity, carried the scent of magnolia blossoms and the distant strains of jazz. Crystal chandeliers glittered overhead, reflecting in the polished marble floors worn smooth by decades of hurried footsteps. Red velvet ropes barely contained the throngs of tourists, conventioneers, and the occasional celebrity seeking a slice of Southern charm. Wrought iron balconies, draped with ferns and bougainvillea, overlooked the bustling streets below.

**Opening:**

Alistair Humphrey Finch, his neatly pressed uniform a crisp contrast to the Louisiana heat, sighed quietly. He adjusted the stack of monogrammed suitcases precariously balanced on his luggage cart. The Grand Majestic was always like this, a perpetual Mardi Gras of arriving and departing guests, a whirlwind of bellhops, maids, and demanding clientele. He navigated the crowded lobby with practiced ease, dodging a tipsy conventioneer brandishing a plastic hurricane glass and sidestepping a gaggle of social media influencers angling for the perfect selfie. Mrs. Van Derlyn, notorious for her outrageous demands and even more outrageous jewelry, was signaling him imperiously from across the room. "Oh, great," Alistair muttered under his breath, a flicker of weariness momentarily dimming the practiced politeness in his bright blue eyes. Today, he suspected, was going to be a long one.
