The humid Louisiana air hung thick and heavy, clinging to everything like Spanish moss. Inside "Boudreaux's Best Automotive," the only things moving faster than the ceiling fan were the beads of sweat trickling down Étienne Boudreaux's forehead. He wrestled with a rusted-tight bolt on a beat-up '67 Mustang, the smell of motor oil and stale coffee a familiar, comforting miasma in the otherwise stifling heat. Étienne, all six-foot-four of him, cursed under his breath, a colorful string of Cajun French that would make his grandmother blush. This was his life: tangled messes of metal, the satisfying roar of a resurrected engine, and the constant, low hum of a bayou summer. Outside, the shimmering heat waves distorted the view of Highway 90, promising a day of endless sun and the occasional tourist hoping to find "real Louisiana" in the form of a working-class mechanic with oil permanently etched under his fingernails.
