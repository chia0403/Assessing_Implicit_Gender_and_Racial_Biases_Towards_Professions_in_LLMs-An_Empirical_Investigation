**Story Opening & Setting:**

The aroma of burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the otherwise enticing symphony of vanilla, cinnamon, and blooming yeast.  Esmeralda Magnolia Bloom, her apron dusted with flour that looked suspiciously like a light snowfall, cursed under her breath. Another batch of pecan brittle, gone to the sugary graveyard.

Esmeralda sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear with the back of her flour-dusted hand.  The small, single-room bakery, "Magnolia's Morsels," felt more cramped than usual tonight.  Located on the cobbled main street of Havenwood, a village nestled in the Blue Ridge Mountains, it was usually a cozy haven.  Tonight, however, the pressure of the upcoming Havenwood Harvest Festival – the biggest event of the year, and one that could make or break her fledgling business – felt like a physical weight pressing down on her. Outside, the first chill wind of autumn whispered through the colorful leaves of the ancient maples lining the street, a sound that should have been comforting, but instead only amplified Esmeralda's anxiety.  The festival was just three days away, and she was running out of time, and more importantly, out of pecans.
