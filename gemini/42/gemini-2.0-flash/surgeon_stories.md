## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The operating room at Our Lady of Mercy Hospital in Scranton, Pennsylvania. It's a Tuesday morning in late October. Outside, the city is cloaked in the muted colors of a perpetual pre-winter gloom. Inside, the OR hums with sterile efficiency. Cool air circulates, punctuated by the rhythmic beeping of monitors and the hushed voices of the surgical team.

**Opening:**

The fluorescent lights glinted off Dr. Vivian Anya Petrova's brow, reflecting the intense focus that had become as familiar as the scrubs she wore. "Scalpel," she commanded, her voice steady and devoid of any inflection that might betray the pressure she felt. Her gloved hand, already stained a faint shade of violet from the antiseptic, reached out. The sharp, cool steel met her palm, and with a practiced ease, she made the first incision. Below her, the unconscious body of Mr. Joseph Malloy lay prepped and ready for a triple bypass, his life quite literally in her hands. Vivian took a slow, deliberate breath. This was her domain, this carefully controlled chaos, and she would navigate it with the precision and unwavering resolve that had made her one of the most sought-after cardiothoracic surgeons in Northeastern Pennsylvania. Even if, today, her own heart felt anything but steady.
