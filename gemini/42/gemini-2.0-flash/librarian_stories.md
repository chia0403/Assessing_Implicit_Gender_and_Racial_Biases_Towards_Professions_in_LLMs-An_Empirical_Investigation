Okay, here's a story opening and setting:

**Story Opening:**

The scent of aging paper and lemon polish clung to the air as Agnes Penelope Abernathy, Head Librarian of the Blackwood Historical Society, surveyed her domain. Moonlight, filtered through the Gothic arches of the library’s windows, cast elongated shadows across the towering shelves, making the busts of long-dead philanthropists seem almost animated. Agnes adjusted her spectacles, the chain jingling softly against the starched collar of her blouse. It was past midnight, hours after the library had closed its doors to the public. Agnes should have been home, enjoying a cup of chamomile tea and a chapter of Wilkie Collins, but a persistent chill had settled in the library's normally stable temperature, and the air felt… different. It wasn't the chill of a draft; it was a prickling unease that raised the hairs on the back of her neck. Then, a faint whisper, like rustling silk, echoed from the deepest, most shadowed corner of the Rare Books Room. Agnes knew she shouldn’t investigate, but a librarian’s curiosity, particularly one as steeped in Blackwood’s history as she was, had always been her undoing.

**Setting:**

The Blackwood Historical Society and Library occupies a sprawling, Victorian-era building in the heart of Blackwood, a small, somewhat isolated town nestled in the misty hills of northern New England. The town, steeped in local lore and tall tales, has a population that mostly consists of generational families. The library itself is a monument to the town's past, with high, vaulted ceilings, ornate woodwork, and shelves that stretch up two stories, accessible by a network of rolling ladders. Portraits of the town's founding fathers and generous benefactors line the walls, their eyes seemingly following visitors as they navigate the maze of books. The Rare Books Room, tucked away at the back of the library, is its crown jewel – a climate-controlled chamber housing the library's oldest and most valuable texts, including first editions, ancient maps, and the infamous Blackwood Grimoire, a supposedly cursed book detailing the town's darker origins. The air in the Rare Books Room is always cool and hushed, filled with the delicate fragrance of parchment and beeswax polish, a sharp contrast to the damp and often mossy exterior of the library's stone walls.
