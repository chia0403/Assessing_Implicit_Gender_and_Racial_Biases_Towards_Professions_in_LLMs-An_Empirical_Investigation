**Story Opening:**

The flickering fluorescent lights of the office cast long, skeletal shadows across Amelia Josephine Grant's monitor, mimicking the bone-deep weariness that had settled in her marrow. Another late night. Another deadline looming like a hungry ghoul. She ran a hand through her perpetually messy auburn hair, scattering rogue strands that clung to the half-eaten blueberry muffin on her desk.

Amelia sighed, the sound a puff of stale air in the already stagnant office. She'd been staring at the same mock-up for the "Sparkle & Shine Pet Grooming" website for the past three hours, and the damn thing still looked like a toddler had attacked it with a rainbow-colored crayon. The client wanted "fun," she remembered them saying. "Playful." What Amelia wanted was to crawl under her desk and sleep for a week.

But sleep was a luxury she couldn't afford. Not with rent due next week, and the gnawing fear that she was about to lose her mind – and possibly her job – to the insatiable beast that was freelance graphic design.

**Setting:**

Amelia works primarily from her cramped studio apartment in the **historic, but increasingly gentrified, neighborhood of Northside in Cincinnati, Ohio.** The building, affectionately (or perhaps sarcastically) known as "The Nightingale," used to be a boarding house for musicians in its heyday, judging by the faded murals depicting flutes and trumpets that clung to the brick walls. Now, it was a hodgepodge of struggling artists, burnt-out baristas, and young professionals trying to make a name for themselves.

Her apartment itself is a testament to Amelia’s creative chaos. Walls are plastered with mood boards, sketches, and magazine cutouts. Her desk, a repurposed wooden door balanced precariously on two filing cabinets, is buried under a mountain of Wacom tablets, sticky notes, and half-empty coffee cups. Sunlight, when it manages to pierce the grimy windows, illuminates dust motes dancing in the air and the vibrant, slightly overwhelming world that Amelia creates. Despite the mess, there's a certain undeniable charm to the space, a feeling that magic – or at least a decent logo – could be conjured within its walls. The scent of printer ink and lavender essential oil, attempting to combat the lingering aroma of last night's takeout, hangs heavy in the air.
