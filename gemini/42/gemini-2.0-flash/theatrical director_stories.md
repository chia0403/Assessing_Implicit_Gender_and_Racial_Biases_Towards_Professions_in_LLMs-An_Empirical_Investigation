## Story Opening:

The scent of stale cigarettes and ambition clung to the air of the Grand Majestic Theatre like a persistent ghost. Eleanor Beatrice Finch, a woman who considered herself a seasoned exorcist of mediocrity, inhaled deeply and felt the familiar burn in her throat. The house lights were dimmed, casting elongated shadows that danced across the plush, burgundy seats. Dust motes pirouetted in the single beam of her work light, illuminating the empty stage like a solitary spotlight on a forgotten dream. She ran a hand through her perpetually messy auburn hair, the wiry strands a testament to sleepless nights fueled by lukewarm coffee and the unwavering belief in her own damn brilliance. This theatre, this echoing cavern of hope and disappointment, was hers now. Or at least, it would be soon.

## Setting:

**The Grand Majestic Theatre, Bridgeport, Connecticut, 1957.**

The Grand Majestic was a once-glorious vaudeville house, now clinging precariously to relevance in a world increasingly captivated by the flickering allure of television. Its ornate facade, a crumbling testament to a bygone era, still hinted at the grandeur it once possessed. Inside, layers of cosmetic fixes – mismatched carpets, patched upholstery, and a coat of cheap paint struggling to conceal the cracks in the plaster – did little to hide the underlying decay. The backstages were labyrinthine, a maze of dusty dressing rooms, cluttered prop storage, and dimly lit corridors where the echoes of past performances seemed to linger. It was a theatre on its last legs, desperate for a miracle, and Eleanor Beatrice Finch was convinced she was the one to deliver it.
