Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a Physician's Assistant named Amelia Grace Davies:

**Setting:** The story opens in the bustling, cramped break room of the "Community Wellness Clinic" in the heart of the fictional town of Havenwood, Maine. The room, barely larger than a walk-in closet, is painted a faded, institutional green.  A flickering fluorescent light casts a harsh glow on mismatched furniture: a dented metal table, three threadbare chairs (one missing its back), and a perpetually overflowing recycling bin crammed with coffee cups and granola bar wrappers.  A bulletin board is plastered with outdated health announcements and potluck sign-up sheets. Outside, the sounds of Havenwood bleed in - the distant rumble of logging trucks, the persistent squawk of seagulls, and the occasional cheerful chime of the ice cream truck making its rounds on Main Street.

Amelia Grace Davies sighed, leaning against the counter littered with crumbs and half-empty coffee mugs. The clatter of silverware and the murmur of voices coming from the clinic lobby seemed miles away, a distant, dull roar. She pulled at the collar of her scrubs, feeling the sticky humidity clinging to her skin. It was mid-July in Havenwood, and even the usually crisp Maine air was thick and heavy.  She took another swig of lukewarm, vaguely floral tea from her chipped ceramic mug – a gift from a particularly grateful patient who’d insisted it held the secret to eternal youth (Amelia suspected it just smelled like her grandmother's attic). Just ten minutes left of her lunch break, and already, she felt the familiar dread creeping back in.  Mrs. Henderson was scheduled for a follow-up on her shingles, old Mr. Peterson was convinced he had athlete's foot *again*, and then there was the teenager with the suspiciously vague “stomach ache” who Amelia suspected needed a different kind of help than she was licensed to provide. Sometimes, being a Physician's Assistant in a small town felt less like practicing medicine and more like being a human Band-Aid for every social ill that plagued Havenwood.
