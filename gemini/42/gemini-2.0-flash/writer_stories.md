The clatter of Parisian rain against the zinc roof of the Hôtel des Rêves was a metronome marking time on Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne’s burgeoning writer’s block. She sat hunched over a chipped, cherry-wood table, the faint ghost of past guests' spilled wine staining its surface, a near-empty bottle of Sancerre mirroring the landscape of her own mind. Outside, the Rue du Bac was a shimmering ribbon of reflected lights, blurred and distorted by the downpour. The year was 1928, and Paris, normally a canvas vibrant with artistic fervor, felt muted, melancholic, a watercolor bleeding at the edges.

Amelia, normally so energized by the city's chaotic beauty, found herself stranded in a sea of unfinished sentences, lost in the labyrinthine alleys of her own imagination. The manuscript of her second novel lay splayed before her, its pages mocking her with their stark whiteness, a testament to the story that stubbornly refused to be told. Her first novel, a roaring success, had bought her this temporary escape, this self-imposed exile to the City of Lights. But instead of inspiring her, Paris seemed to be holding her captive, its glamour and romance only amplifying the deafening silence within her. The rain continued its relentless assault, a rhythmic reminder of the pressure mounting on her shoulders. She was Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne, celebrated author, and she was utterly, hopelessly, and terrifyingly stuck.
