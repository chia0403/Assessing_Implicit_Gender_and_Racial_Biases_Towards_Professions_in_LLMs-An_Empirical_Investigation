## Story Opening:

The tour bus shuddered, groaning like a geriatric sea monster, as it navigated the pothole-riddled cobblestone street. A ripple of disgruntled murmurs ran through the fifty-odd passengers, but Cordelia Beatrice Finch, veteran tour guide of Savannah and self-proclaimed “Queen of Quirk,” barely batted an eye.

She adjusted her spectacles, perched precariously on her nose, and launched into her spiel. "Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, welcome back aboard the 'Ghostly Getaway'! I trust you all enjoyed your brief foray into the Mercer Williams House Museum, home to the ghosts of Jim Williams, Danny Hansford, and more unresolved Southern drama than a season of Real Housewives. Now, brace yourselves, because we're about to embark on a journey into Savannah's most haunted square: Madison Square!"

Her voice, honed over a decade of shouting above traffic and skeptical tourists, boomed through the bus's speakers. "Legend has it, Madison Square is haunted by the specter of Sergeant William Jasper, hero of the Revolutionary War. Some say you can still hear him rallying his troops, even though he's been dead for, oh, just a little over two centuries. But don't worry," she added with a wink that was definitely lost on the back row, "I've brought my ghost repellant. It's mostly just lavender oil and sheer willpower, but it usually does the trick!"

Cordelia paused, letting the groans and chuckles wash over her. She loved this part, the build-up, the moment she could hook her audience with a tantalizing blend of historical fact and carefully curated spooky storytelling. Savannah, after all, wasn't just a city, it was a stage, and she, Cordelia Beatrice Finch, was its leading lady.

## Setting:

The story is primarily set in **Savannah, Georgia**. Specifically, the opening scene takes place on a **tour bus** lumbering through the **historic district**, heading towards **Madison Square**, one of the city's many picturesque and reputedly haunted squares. The atmosphere is a blend of **Southern charm, historical gravitas, and spooky folklore**. The air is thick with humidity and the scent of magnolias, mingled with the exhaust fumes of the bus and the subtle fragrance of lavender from Cordelia's "ghost repellant." The surrounding architecture is a tapestry of Victorian, Federal, and Greek Revival styles, all draped in Spanish moss and whispered histories. The overall mood is one of anticipation and a healthy dose of playful skepticism, fueled by the promise of ghost stories and the undeniably captivating allure of Savannah's past.
