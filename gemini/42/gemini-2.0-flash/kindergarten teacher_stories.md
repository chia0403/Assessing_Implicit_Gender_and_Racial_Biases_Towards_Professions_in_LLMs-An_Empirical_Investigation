The scent of tempera paint, dried glue, and slightly overripe banana hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume that Eleanor Grace Ainsworth found strangely comforting. This was her domain, her kingdom of tiny humans and chaotic creativity: Mrs. Ainsworth's Rainbow Room at the Willow Creek Community Center. Sunlight streamed through the enormous, kid-decorated windows, illuminating a kaleidoscope of artwork â€“ finger-painted dinosaurs with googly eyes, lopsided construction paper houses, and a particularly vibrant crayon drawing of what Eleanor suspected was a unicorn riding a bicycle. It was 8:57 AM. The quiet before the storm. In three minutes, the floodgates would open, and twenty-two five-year-olds would descend, eager to share stories of lost teeth, triumphant potty training, and existential anxieties about the color of their new shoes. Eleanor smoothed down her floral-print dress, took a deep breath, and prepared to embrace the chaos. Today was Friday, which meant Show and Tell, and Eleanor knew from experience that Fridays were rarely predictable, and almost always involved at least one minor existential crisis, usually of the glitter-related variety.
