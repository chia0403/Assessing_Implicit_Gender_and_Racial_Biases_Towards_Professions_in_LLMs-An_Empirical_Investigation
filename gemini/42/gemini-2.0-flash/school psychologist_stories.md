## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous song in the cramped, windowless office of Dr. Eleanor Victoria Ainsworth. The air, thick with the lingering scent of cheap disinfectant and the faint phantom odor of spilled juice boxes, did little to lift her spirits. Stacks of manila folders, each a testament to the anxieties and burgeoning personalities of Orchard Elementary School, threatened to topple from her desk. Outside, the muffled shrieks and laughter of children at recess filtered through the thick cinderblock walls, a chaotic symphony that usually brought a smile to Eleanor's face. Today, however, it only amplified the pounding ache behind her eyes.

**Opening:**

Dr. Eleanor Victoria Ainsworth stared at the meticulously organized chaos on her desk, a carefully curated system only she could decipher. The top folder, labeled in a child's shaky handwriting "Tommy's Feelings," was the culprit. Tommy, a bright, sensitive second-grader, had been exhibiting escalating outbursts, fits of rage that sent library books flying and brought tears to his classmates' eyes. Eleanor had tried everything: art therapy, cognitive behavioral exercises, even bribing him with stickers (an act she privately considered a professional low point). Nothing seemed to penetrate the wall he'd built around himself, a wall thicker and more formidable than the cinderblock surrounding her office. The phone on her desk buzzed, jolting her from her thoughts. Principal Thompson's extension. Eleanor sighed, bracing herself for the inevitable. Another incident. Another shattered classroom. Another child, and his feelings, slipping further away.
