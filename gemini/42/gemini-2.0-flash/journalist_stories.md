Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a story with a journalist main character:

**Setting:**

A cramped, perpetually damp office in the basement of the "Skalborg Tidende," a small-town newspaper nestled in the heart of the Norwegian fjords. The air smells faintly of stale coffee, printer ink, and the pervasive musk of damp stone. Outside, the perpetually overcast sky mirrors the mood within the newsroom, a space crammed with overflowing in-trays, dusty filing cabinets, and the relics of a bygone era of print journalism. A single, small window, thick with grime, offers a limited view of the perpetually drizzling street above. The year is 2024, and the relentless tide of digital news threatens the very existence of the Skalborg Tidende.

**Story Opening:**

The ringing phone sliced through the quiet hum of the afternoon, startling Astrid Bergquist out of a reverie fueled by too much lukewarm coffee and the hypnotic repetition of editing local council meeting minutes. Astrid, a journalist whose name was usually muttered with the reverence of a local hero, was now regarded with the polite sympathy one reserves for a relic from a bygone era. She snatched the receiver, the Bakelite cold against her ear. “Bergquist, Skalborg Tidende.” Her voice, normally sharp and confident, held a weary edge.

A crackly voice, thick with static and an unfamiliar accent, answered. “Astrid Bergquist? I need to talk to you. About the incident at the lighthouse. It wasn't…natural.”
