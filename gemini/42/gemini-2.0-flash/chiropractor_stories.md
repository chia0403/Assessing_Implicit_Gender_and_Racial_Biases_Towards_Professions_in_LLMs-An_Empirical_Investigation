## Story Opening:

The rain hammered against the panoramic windows of Dr. Evelyn Grace Abernathy's clinic, mimicking the relentless ache in her lower back. She straightened, wincing, and adjusted the lumbar support on her ergonomic chair. Outside, the Seattle skyline blurred into a watercolor wash of grey and green.

Evelyn glanced at the appointment schedule displayed on her tablet. A few cancellations thanks to the downpour. Good. She could use the respite. Today had already felt like a marathon of misaligned spines and stressed-out shoulders. Sheâ€™d even cracked a client's coccyx, a feat she both regretted and silently admired.

A sudden gust rattled the windows, and the power flickered. The muted jazz playlist emanating from her sound system stuttered, then died. Evelyn sighed. Seattle in October. Predictable. She pushed back from her desk, the smooth leather groaning beneath her weight.

**Setting:**

Dr. Evelyn Grace Abernathy's chiropractic clinic, "Aligned & Adjusted," occupies the tenth floor of a modern glass building in the Belltown neighborhood of Seattle. The interior is designed to be both calming and sophisticated. Polished concrete floors are softened by thick, Persian rugs in muted blues and greens. The walls are painted a soothing shade of grey, punctuated by large, framed prints of anatomical illustrations rendered in a contemporary, almost abstract style.

The waiting area boasts comfortable, mid-century modern furniture upholstered in textured fabrics. A small library of books on wellness, nutrition, and alternative therapies lines one wall. The reception desk is crafted from reclaimed wood and topped with a smooth slab of granite. The air smells faintly of eucalyptus and peppermint, a carefully curated blend intended to ease tension.

Beyond the reception area are three treatment rooms, each equipped with state-of-the-art chiropractic tables and various diagnostic tools. Evelyn's personal office, located at the back of the clinic, is a more cluttered space, reflecting her own slightly chaotic energy. Stacks of journals and research papers compete for space with anatomical models and framed certificates. The large windows offer a breathtaking view of the Puget Sound, a view that Evelyn rarely has the time to truly appreciate. The overall impression is one of professional competence and quiet luxury, designed to reassure patients that they are in good hands, even as the rain continues to lash against the glass.
