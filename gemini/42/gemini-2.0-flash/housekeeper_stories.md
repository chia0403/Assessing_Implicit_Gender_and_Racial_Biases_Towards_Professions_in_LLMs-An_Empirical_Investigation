The chipped porcelain of Mrs. Abernathy's teacup was a perfect echo of the woman herself: fragile, cracked, but stubbornly refusing to shatter. Elsie Mae Pruitt, hovering near the floral-patterned sofa with a feather duster clutched in her gloved hand, held her breath as Mrs. Abernathy took a delicate sip, her pinky extended just so. If a single drop landed on the Persian rug, Elsie knew she'd hear about it for the rest of the week.

The setting was "Briarwood," a sprawling Victorian mansion perched atop a windswept bluff overlooking the turbulent Pacific Ocean in Monterey, California. Constructed in 1898 by a shipping magnate with more money than sense, Briarwood was a monument to excess: towering ceilings adorned with cherubic murals, labyrinthine corridors lined with antique weaponry, and gardens that swallowed gardeners whole. It was beautiful, undoubtedly, but also drafty, demanding, and deeply, unsettlingly lonely. Elsie had been the housekeeper at Briarwood for the past six months, inheriting the position from her ailing grandmother, and in that time, she'd learned the creaks and groans of the old house better than she knew her own reflection. She'd also learned that beneath the veneer of opulent grandeur lay a pervasive, almost suffocating sadness, clinging to the brocade curtains and whispering in the rustling leaves of the ancient oak trees that surrounded the property.
