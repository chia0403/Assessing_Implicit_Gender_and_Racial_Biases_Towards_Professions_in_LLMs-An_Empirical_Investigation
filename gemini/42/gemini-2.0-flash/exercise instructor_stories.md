## Story Opening:

The biting November wind whipped across the Esplanade, snatching at the loose ends of Amelia Grace Carter's scarf.  She ignored the shivers crawling up her spine, focusing instead on the rhythm of her own breathing.  Her lungs burned a pleasant ache, the kind she usually inflicted on her early morning bootcamp class before most of the city had even considered peeling themselves out of bed.  This morning, however, was for her. A rare moment stolen before the onslaught of holiday-induced stress and the inevitable influx of new clients desperate to ‘get fit’ before Christmas.

She pushed harder, her running shoes pounding a steady beat against the cobblestones.  The Charles River, steel grey and choppy, reflected the pre-dawn sky.  A few brave rowers sliced through the water, their silhouettes sharp against the faint pink glow on the horizon.  Amelia breathed deeply, trying to absorb the stillness of the moment.  She knew it wouldn't last. Soon, the city would roar awake, and she'd be back in her element, a whirlwind of energy and encouragement, pushing others towards their physical peak.  But for now, here, on this blustery morning, she was just Amelia, finding her own strength in the face of the approaching storm.
