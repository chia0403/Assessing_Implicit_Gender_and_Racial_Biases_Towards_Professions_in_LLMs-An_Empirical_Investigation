## Story Opening:

The sterile scent of antiseptic clung to Dr. Eleanor Vance's nostrils, a familiar comfort in the chaos that was her life. Tonight, that comfort was wearing thin. The relentless drumming of rain against the windows of her small cottage clinic was a symphony of stress, perfectly mirroring the frenzied rhythm in her own chest. Outside, the November wind howled a mournful tune, promising a long and bitter winter.

She glanced at the antique grandfather clock in the corner, its polished brass pendulum swinging with a hypnotic regularity that seemed to mock her current predicament. 3:17 AM. Three hours ago, the call had come. A frantic voice, barely coherent, reporting a desperate situation up in the Blackwood Forest. A young woman, hurt. Badly.

Eleanor tightened the knot on her scarf, the familiar action a small act of defiance against the creeping fear. Blackwood was isolated, a place whispered about in hushed tones by the villagers. Legends of strange creatures and ancient magic clung to its gnarled trees like the mist that perpetually shrouded its depths.

Normally, Eleanor would have called for an ambulance, but the caller had been adamant. No sirens. No police. Just a doctor. A doctor who understood the secrets that the village of Oakhaven tried so hard to forget.

Eleanor knew this meant she was walking into something far more complicated than a simple injury. Something steeped in the folklore and superstition that she, as a woman of science, had always scoffed at. Yet, the desperation in the voice on the other end of the line, the palpable fear that had resonated even through the static, had overridden her skepticism.

She grabbed her battered medical bag, its worn leather testament to years of service. Tonight, medicine might not be enough. Tonight, she might need something else. Something she didn't even believe in.

## Setting:

**The Scene:** Dr. Eleanor Vance's cottage clinic is nestled on the edge of Oakhaven, a small, isolated village nestled deep within the English countryside.

**Description:** The clinic is a converted stone cottage, its walls thick and sturdy against the elements. The interior is cozy, bordering on cluttered, with shelves overflowing with medical journals, antique apothecary jars, and half-finished projects. A crackling fire burns in the hearth, casting dancing shadows across the room. Despite its organized chaos, the clinic exudes a sense of warmth and competence. The air is a mix of antiseptic, herbs, and the faint, earthy smell of the surrounding countryside. Outside, the village is dark and silent, save for the relentless rain and the howling wind. Beyond the village lies the imposing Blackwood Forest, a dense and ancient woodland that looms over Oakhaven like a silent, watchful guardian.
