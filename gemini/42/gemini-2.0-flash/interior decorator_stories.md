The early morning light, a diluted apricot wash, was already fighting a losing battle against the grey drizzle clinging to the windows of "The Painted Lark," Abigail Willowbrook's boutique interior design studio. A bell above the door, tinkling with the delicate chime of a robin's song, announced her arrival. Abigail, bundled in a tweed coat the color of damp earth, brushed the raindrops from her blonde fringe and sighed.

The studio was a haven of curated chaos. Rolls of wallpaper, patterned with everything from whimsical floral prints to geometric modern designs, leaned against walls painted in soothing shades of sage and dusty rose. Swatches of fabrics, silks and velvets and linens, lay scattered like fallen leaves on antique tables. Shelves overflowed with miniature lamps, ornate candlesticks, and quirky ceramic figurines - a collection that Abigail called her "inspiration army." A faint scent of beeswax and lavender lingered in the air, a constant reminder of the calming, elegant spaces she strived to create.

Abigail moved towards her desk, a sprawling mahogany monstrosity inherited from her grandmother, and began sifting through a stack of invoices, her fingers tracing the delicate script of each client name. Outside, the rain intensified, drumming a melancholic rhythm against the glass. It was going to be one of *those* days, she could feel it in her bones.
