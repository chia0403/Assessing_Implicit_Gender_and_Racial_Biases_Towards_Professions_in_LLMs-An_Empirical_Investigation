Okay, here's a story opening and setting, with the childcare worker:

**Setting:** A bustling, brightly colored daycare center called "Little Sprouts Learning Center" in the heart of the vibrant, slightly bohemian neighborhood of Kensington, Philadelphia. Sunlight streams through the large, street-facing windows, illuminating the alphabet rug and the rainbow-colored walls adorned with children's artwork. The air hums with the happy cacophony of twenty toddlers playing, singing, and occasionally engaging in minor acts of collaborative destruction. It's a Tuesday morning, and the energy is already high, despite the fact that most of the children have only been there for an hour. The faint aroma of oatmeal and disinfectant hangs in the air, a testament to the morning's breakfast and the constant battle against germs.

**Story Opening:**

The shrill, insistent wail of three-year-old Leo threatened to derail Abigail Rose Callahan’s carefully constructed morning schedule. She'd managed to settle most of the group into a round of building towers with colorful blocks, a small victory against the usual tide of toddler chaos. Now, however, Leo was clinging to her leg, tears streaming down his face, chanting, "Mommy! Mommy! I want Mommy!" Abigail knelt down, her knees cracking a protest she mostly ignored these days. She gently peeled Leo's sticky fingers from her jeans. "Leo, honey," she said, her voice a soothing balm she’d perfected over the last five years, "Mommy will be back after naptime. How about we build a really tall tower, taller than you, even? Then Mommy will see how amazing you are when she comes to pick you up." The promise seemed to work, or at least, it bought her a few precious minutes. Leo sniffled, wiping his nose on the sleeve of his Thomas the Tank Engine t-shirt, and reluctantly shuffled towards the block corner. Abigail sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. It was going to be one of *those* days.
