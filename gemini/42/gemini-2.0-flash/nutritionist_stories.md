## The Story Opening:

The scent of turmeric and something faintly floral, perhaps cardamom, clung to Dr. Anya Sharma as she locked the door to her office. The aroma was a comfort, a familiar balm against the gnawing anxiety that had been building all day. Mrs. Gable, a woman whose obsession with the latest celebrity detox had bordered on the alarming, had finally been nudged, hopefully permanently, towards a balanced Mediterranean diet. Now, Anya just needed to hold onto that small victory as she navigated the gauntlet of her own evening.

She pulled her scarf tighter around her neck, shielding herself against the biting November wind whipping down Bleecker Street. The sky above Greenwich Village was a bruised purple, threatening rain, and the city noises, usually a vibrant soundtrack to her life, felt harsh and invasive tonight. A flashing neon sign for "Pizza Palace - Gluten Free Options!" mocked her as she hurried past, clutching her reusable grocery bag. Tonight, however, pizza, even the gluten-free kind, held no appeal. Tonight, Anya needed something more than food. She needed a distraction.

## The Setting:

**Dr. Anya Sharma’s office:** Located above a used bookstore on Bleecker Street in the heart of Greenwich Village, New York City. It's a small, warm space designed to feel welcoming and non-clinical. One wall is lined with shelves overflowing with cookbooks, research papers, and jars of colorful spices. Another wall boasts a chalkboard covered in vibrant, hand-drawn diagrams of the digestive system and lists of seasonal produce. A comfortable armchair sits across from Anya's desk, which is usually buried under a stack of client files and research articles. The overall atmosphere is one of organized chaos, reflecting Anya’s energetic and empathetic approach to nutrition.

**Bleecker Street:** A vibrant and bustling street in Greenwich Village, known for its eclectic mix of shops, restaurants, and historical significance. Even in the evening chill, the street is teeming with people – tourists, NYU students, long-time residents – all hurrying to their destinations or lingering in the doorways of cafes and bars. The air is thick with the aroma of various cuisines, from Italian to Ethiopian, and the sidewalks are a patchwork of crumbling concrete and newly laid brick.
