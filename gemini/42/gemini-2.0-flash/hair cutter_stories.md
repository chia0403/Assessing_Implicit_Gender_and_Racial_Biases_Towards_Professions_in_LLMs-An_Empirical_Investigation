## Story Opening:

The bell above the door of "Shear Delights" jingled a cheerful little tune, a sound usually welcomed by Beatrice Eleanor Hawthorne, but today, it only amplified the pounding ache behind her temples. She glanced up from the tangled mass of grey hair she was attempting to sculpt into something resembling a bob, a weak smile plastered on her face. Another client. Another hour of strained conversation and the ever-present fear of accidentally taking off an ear.

Beatrice sighed, flicking a rogue strand of silver hair from her cheek. She loved her job, truly. Or rather, she *used* to love her job. There was a time when the scent of hairspray and the hum of the clippers filled her with a vibrant energy, a sense of creation. Now, it mostly filled her with existential dread and the overwhelming urge to lie face down on a massage table for a solid week.

The new arrival, a young woman with hair the color of burnt caramel and eyes that darted nervously around the shop, hesitated just inside the doorway. Beatrice forced herself to stand straighter, banishing the tremor that had plagued her hand all morning. "Welcome to Shear Delights," she said, her voice a touch too bright. "I'm Beatrice. How can I help you?"

## Setting:

**Shear Delights** is a small, independent hair salon nestled on the quieter end of Elm Street in the sleepy, coastal town of Seabrook, Maine. The building itself is a charming, two-story Victorian with peeling, baby-blue paint and a slightly crooked porch. Inside, the decor is a deliberate attempt at vintage chic, teetering precariously on the edge of outright kitsch.

Think faded floral wallpaper, mismatched antique chairs covered in velvet of dubious origin, and a collection of quirky hair-related memorabilia Beatrice inherited from her grandmother, the salon's founder. Vintage combs hang in ornate frames, a mannequin head sporting a beehive hairstyle sits precariously on a bookshelf, and the air perpetually smells of a sweet, almost cloying mix of hairspray, lavender shampoo, and the faint, underlying aroma of Beatrice's anxiety. Large windows overlook the street, offering a view of the occasional seagull strutting across the sidewalk and the distant sparkle of the Atlantic Ocean on a clear day. The overall effect is comforting, nostalgic, and just a little bit overwhelming, much like Beatrice herself.
