**Setting:** The opulent, hushed trading floor of Montgomery Prescott Capital in downtown Manhattan. Sunlight streamed through the massive, arched windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air above a sea of blinking computer screens and tightly wound professionals. The air hummed with the low thrum of servers and the barely-contained energy of millions of dollars changing hands every second.

**Opening:**

The shrill ring of the emergency phone sliced through the orchestrated chaos like a jagged piece of glass. Every head, meticulously coiffed or brutally shaved, snapped up. On a day where markets were already teetering on the brink of a precipice, any unscheduled disturbance felt like the beginning of the end.

The phone continued its insistent screech, unanswered. Most brokers were too engrossed in their screens, too absorbed in the dance of numbers, to acknowledge its existence. Until, finally, a long, manicured hand reached out and snatched it from its cradle.

"Montgomery Prescott Capital, trading desk," a voice, sharp and laced with barely-concealed impatience, barked into the receiver.

It was **Vivienne Eleanor Dubois**. She was one of the youngest Vice Presidents the firm had ever seen, a rising star known for her ruthless efficiency and uncanny ability to predict market fluctuations. Her silk power suit, perfectly tailored to her lean frame, screamed success, but the dark circles under her bright blue eyes hinted at the relentless pressure she endured.

Vivienne listened, her face paling beneath her expertly applied makeup. The room around her seemed to fade, the hum of the trading floor morphing into a distant, muffled roar. The confident veneer she wore like armor began to crack.

"Repeat that," she finally whispered, her voice barely audible above the din. The hand holding the phone trembled, a tell she desperately tried to conceal. "Say it again. Slower this time."
