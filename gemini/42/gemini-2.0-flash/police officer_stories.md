The acrid smell of burnt sugar and cheap whiskey clung to the air thicker than the morning fog rolling in off the Mississippi. Detective Isabella "Izzy" Rossi coughed, pulling the collar of her worn leather jacket higher. This wasn't her first time breathing in the aftermath of someone's desperate attempt at masking a crime, and it certainly wouldn't be her last in the French Quarter.

The setting: A dimly lit, back alley behind a supposedly haunted antique shop on Royal Street in New Orleans. Rain slicks the cobblestones, reflecting the hazy glow of a single flickering gas lamp hanging precariously from the brick wall. Graffiti, a chaotic tapestry of vibrant colors and cryptic symbols, covers every available surface. Rat droppings crunch under Izzy’s worn Doc Martens. A rusty fire escape, twisted and skeletal, climbs the building’s back, disappearing into the murky sky. The air hums with a low, unsettling thrum, a blend of distant jazz music, the mournful wail of a tugboat on the river, and something else... something indefinable, something that prickles at the back of Izzy's neck. This alley, like the city itself, was a place where secrets festered and history clung like Spanish moss.
