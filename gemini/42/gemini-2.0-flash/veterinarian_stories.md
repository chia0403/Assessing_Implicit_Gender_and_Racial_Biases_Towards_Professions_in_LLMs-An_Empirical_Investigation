## Story Opening:

The biting February wind whipped snow into Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth's face as she wrestled with the recalcitrant latch of the old barn door. Her gloved hands, already numb, fumbled uselessly, and she cursed under her breath, the sound swallowed by the howling wind. Inside, she could hear the frantic whinnies of a mare in distress, punctuated by the worried murmurs of a farmhand. Eleanor knew time was slipping away, each wasted second potentially catastrophic. She finally managed to wrench the latch open, the rusted metal screaming in protest, and pushed the heavy door inward, forcing her way into the relative warmth of the barn.

## Setting:

The scene unfolds on the sprawling, snow-dusted Clover Creek Farm, a working horse farm nestled in the foothills of the Adirondack Mountains in upstate New York. The air is thick with the scent of hay, manure, and the faintly metallic tang of fear. The barn is old, its wooden beams worn smooth with age and riddled with the scars of generations of horses. The interior is dimly lit by a single, flickering bulb hanging precariously from the rafters, casting long, dancing shadows that seem to mock Eleanor's urgency. Stalls line both sides of a central aisle, each occupied by a nervous, restless horse. To the left, in a specially padded birthing stall, a chestnut mare named Belle paces anxiously, her sides heaving, her eyes wild with pain. A young farmhand, barely more than a boy, kneels beside her, his face etched with concern, stroking her flank and whispering soothing words that are clearly doing little to calm her.
