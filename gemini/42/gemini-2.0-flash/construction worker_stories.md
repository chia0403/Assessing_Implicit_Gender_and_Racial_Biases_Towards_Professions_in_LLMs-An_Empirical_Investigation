Okay, here's a story opening and setting with the requested details:

**Opening:**

The bone-jarring rattle of the pneumatic drill vibrated up through Leonardo "Leo" Mancini’s gloved hands, a familiar symphony of controlled chaos. Dust, a gritty, orange haze, billowed around him, coating his eyelashes and clinging to the stubble on his jaw. He pressed harder, the metal biting into the unforgiving concrete. This was it, the last damn anchor point on this section of the bridge support. He'd been at it since dawn, and the sun, a malevolent orange eye peering through the smog, was starting to creep towards its zenith.

One final burst, a satisfying crack, and the drill shuddered to a halt. Leo killed the engine, the sudden silence amplified by the relentless wind whistling through the steel girders. He pulled the drill bit free, a triumphant grunt escaping his lips. Almost done. Just a few more sections like this one and he could finally go home, soak his aching muscles in a hot bath, and maybe, just maybe, catch the Yankees game on the radio.

He wiped the sweat from his brow with the back of his grimy glove, leaving a smear of mud and grease. Looking out across the expanse before him, he saw the sprawling metropolis in the distance, seemingly so close, yet worlds away from this precarious perch. It was beautiful, in a strange, industrial kind of way. He was building something important, something that would connect people, a vital artery pumping life into the city below.

Then he saw it, a flicker of movement near the base of the support he was working on, something that was definitely not meant to be there...

**Setting:**

The story is set on the elevated, unfinished section of the "Liberty Span Bridge," a massive suspension bridge under construction in present-day New York City. Specifically, the bridge is being built to connect the borough of Queens with the outer parts of Brooklyn over the vast industrial marshlands bordering the ocean.

The environment is harsh and unforgiving. The air is thick with the smell of salt and diesel fumes. The wind is relentless, buffeting the workers and carrying grit and debris everywhere. The constant noise of construction – jackhammers, cranes, shouting voices, the whine of power tools – is deafening.

The bridge itself is a skeleton of steel and concrete, a skeletal framework reaching towards the sky. It's a dangerous place to work, high above the ground, with little room for error. The workers are constantly exposed to the elements and the risk of accidents is ever-present. But it is their job to tame this environment. They are the builders of giants, the titans who transform blueprints into reality. The bridge is a monument to human ingenuity and ambition, a testament to the power of teamwork and hard work. But this time, something sinister threatens to undermine all they have worked to achieve.
