The rain was a greasy, insistent sheet against the windows of Leo Maxwell's office, a fitting metaphor for the case he was currently drowning in. Leo leaned back in his creaking, faux-leather chair, the low hum of the fluorescent lights a counterpoint to the rhythmic drumming on the glass. His fingers, stained with the ghost of nicotine he'd sworn off five years ago, tapped impatiently on the thick manila folder. It contained the sum total of his professional misfortunes: the Bailey v. Sterling estate case. A battle for a dead billionaire's fortune that had started as a simple will contest and morphed into a mud-slinging, character-assassinating circus worthy of the National Enquirer.

Leo's office, located on the seventh floor of a pre-war building in the less-than-glamorous section of downtown Chicago, reflected his current state of affairs: cluttered, bordering on chaotic, and desperately in need of an upgrade. Legal briefs and law journals teetered precariously on shelves crammed with dusty legal tomes. A half-eaten pastrami on rye sat abandoned on a corner of his desk, a casualty of the late hours he'd been pulling. The only personal touch was a framed photograph of his daughter, Lily, her gap-toothed smile a painful reminder of the life he was struggling to maintain amidst the legal maelstrom. From his window, he could see the flickering neon sign of "Rosie's Diner," a beacon of greasy comfort in the oppressive cityscape. It was a place he frequented often these days, a refuge from the storm raging inside and out. Tonight, however, Rosie's siren call would have to wait. He had a deadline, a desperate plea for a legal miracle, and a rainstorm to contend with.
