## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The biting wind whipped off the Firth of Forth, stinging Elspeth's cheeks and carrying the scent of brine and damp timber. Crail, a picturesque fishing village on the eastern coast of Scotland, huddled beneath a sky the color of pewter. Cobbled streets, slick with rain, twisted between whitewashed cottages, each topped with red pantile roofs and clinging precariously to the cliff edge. It was early November, and the brief daylight hours were already dwindling, casting long, skeletal shadows from the skeletal masts of the few remaining boats in the harbor. The rhythmic clang of a blacksmith's hammer carried on the wind, a lonely counterpoint to the incessant cry of gulls wheeling overhead.

**Story Opening:**

Elspeth MacIntyre swore under her breath, wrestling with the warped plank of oak. The workshop, a cramped space behind her family's cottage on the Braehead, offered little respite from the chill. She could feel it seeping into her bones, numbing her fingers despite the thick wool gloves she wore. Sawdust clung to her already threadbare tweed trousers, a testament to the hours she poured into her craft. At thirty-two, Elspeth MacIntyre was the finest carpenter in Crail, a skill passed down from her father, though most folks still looked askance at a woman wielding a plane and chisel. Today, however, even her renowned precision seemed to have deserted her. The funeral procession was scheduled for tomorrow, and she was battling a stubborn piece of timber for the headboard of Agnes McBride's coffin. It needed to be perfect. Agnes had been a friend, a fierce, loyal woman with a mischievous twinkle in her eye, and Elspeth refused to send her off with anything less than her best. But the wood, it seemed, had other ideas. It bucked and resisted her efforts, whispering secrets of decay and the inevitable return to the earth.
