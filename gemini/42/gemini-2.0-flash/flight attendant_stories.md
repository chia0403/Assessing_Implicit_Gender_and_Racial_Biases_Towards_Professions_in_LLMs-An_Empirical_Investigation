**Story Opening:**

The turbulence hit like a sudden, unwelcome guest. It wasn't the usual gentle rocking that sent nervous passengers clutching at armrests; this was a violent, shuddering assault that rattled the overhead compartments and made the oxygen masks bounce in their housings. For a terrifying moment, Eleanor Grace Davies felt the bottom drop out of her stomach, a sensation she usually only associated with bad coffee and the pre-dawn commute to Heathrow. She tightened her grip on the jump seat armrests, her knuckles white against the faded blue fabric. This was far beyond the usual “fasten your seatbelts” announcement. This was different.

**Setting:**

The interior of an aging Boeing 747-400, specifically configured for long-haul routes. The aircraft, operated by the fictional airline "Global Skies," boasts a somewhat faded grandeur. Think worn velvet seats in "World Traveler" class, stained and slightly sticky tray tables, and overhead compartments that groan under the weight of duty-free purchases and oversized carry-ons. The ambient lighting is a sickly yellow-white, designed to lull passengers into a false sense of relaxation, which is failing miserably under the current circumstances. Outside the small oval windows, a churning expanse of slate grey clouds stretches as far as the eye can see, promising nothing but more turbulence. The air is thick with the recycled breath of hundreds of passengers and a faint, underlying scent of jet fuel and disinfectant. The flight is GS-243, en route from London Heathrow (LHR) to Buenos Aires, Argentina (EZE), and is currently somewhere over the vast, unforgiving expanse of the Atlantic Ocean.
