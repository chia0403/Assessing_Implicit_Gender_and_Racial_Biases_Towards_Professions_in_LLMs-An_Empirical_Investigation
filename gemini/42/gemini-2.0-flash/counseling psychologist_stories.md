Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a counseling psychologist:

**Story Opening:**

The persistent hum of the fluorescent lights in her office seemed to mock Dr. Eleanor Vivian Holloway's dwindling patience. It was almost seven PM, and her last client, a fretful young man convinced his coffee consumption was the root of all existential dread, had finally shuffled out the door. Eleanor rubbed the bridge of her nose, the faint scent of lavender oil emanating from the aromatherapy diffuser doing little to soothe the tension knotting her shoulders. Outside, the city was a cacophony of honking taxis and distant sirens, a stark contrast to the manufactured tranquility she tried to cultivate within these four walls. She should be home, curled up with a good book and a glass of wine. Instead, she was staring at the overflowing in-tray, a monument to the endless stream of human suffering she attempted to alleviate, one fifty-minute session at a time. A new case file sat on top: *Doe, Jane*. Just the name was enough to bring a fresh wave of weariness. Another anonymous soul, another tangled web of pain.

**Setting:**

Dr. Eleanor Vivian Hollowayâ€™s counseling office is located on the 12th floor of a slightly-dated office building in the heart of downtown Chicago. The building itself is a study in corporate beige, but Eleanor has attempted to inject personality into her space. The waiting room is painted a calming shade of sage green, furnished with comfortable armchairs upholstered in muted floral patterns, and adorned with prints of impressionistic landscapes. A small water feature gurgles softly in the corner, ostensibly to create a soothing atmosphere, though Eleanor sometimes suspects it's more of a white noise machine to drown out the sounds of the busy street below.

Her office is smaller, more intimate. Bookshelves overflow with volumes on psychology, philosophy, and self-help, creating a sense of scholarly comfort. A large, comfortable armchair faces her desk, strategically placed to encourage a feeling of openness during sessions. On the desk, amidst the papers and files, sits a small framed photo of Eleanor hiking in the Rocky Mountains, a reminder of the world outside and the restorative power of nature. The overall effect is one of warmth and professionalism, a sanctuary carved out in the midst of the urban jungle, a place where people can hopefully feel safe enough to unravel their deepest fears. However, on this particular evening, the sanctuary feels a little less serene, a little more suffocating.
