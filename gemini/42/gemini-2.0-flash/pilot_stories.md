## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** A cramped, corrugated metal hangar clings to the side of a jagged, wind-swept mountain range in the Yukon Territory, Canada. Inside, the air smells of aviation fuel, old oil, and the faint, lingering scent of pipe tobacco. The roar of a distant river echoes through the thin metal walls, competing with the clatter of loose tools on a workbench. Outside, the perpetual twilight of a late-autumn evening bleeds across a canvas of snow-dusted peaks and a sky the color of bruised plums.

**Opening:**

The wrench slipped in Amelia "Amy" Quinn's greasy hand, clanging against the dented cowling of her de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver. A curse, sharp as the Yukon wind, escaped her lips. This wasn't just *a* repair, it felt like she was single-handedly holding the entire damn bush plane together with chewing gum and sheer stubbornness. Another week and the snows would be truly upon them, effectively grounding her until spring. And she had one last delivery to make. One last chance to earn enough to keep the wolves – literal and financial – from the door of her small air taxi service, Northern Skies Aviation. Amelia wiped her forehead with the back of her grimy hand, leaving a streak of oil across her brow. Time was running out. And so, it seemed, was her luck.
