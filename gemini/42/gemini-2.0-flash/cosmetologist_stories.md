## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The stifling Florida heat clung to everything like a damp shroud, even inside "The Salty Siren," a small, kitschy salon tucked away on a side street in the tourist-trap town of Neptune Beach. Palm trees, perpetually rustling in the sea breeze, were visible through the large front window, their fronds casting dappled shadows on the worn linoleum floor. The air, thick with the cloying scents of coconut-scented hairspray and cheap acrylic nails, was punctuated by the buzz of hairdryers and the murmur of gossiping clients.

**Opening:**

Bernadette "Bernie" Amelia Ricci pinched the bridge of her nose, the faint scent of acetone doing little to soothe the throbbing ache behind her eyes. Another spray tan gone wrong. Another entitled tourist demanding "instant bronzed goddess" results. Another afternoon edging closer to complete and utter burnout. She glanced at the clock above the reception desk - 4:57 PM. Almost there. Almost freedom. 

She tossed the disposable gloves onto the overflowing trash can and sighed, the weight of the day settling heavily on her shoulders. Five years. Five years she'd poured her heart and soul (and savings) into The Salty Siren, dreaming of creating a haven of beauty and self-care for the local community. Instead, it had become a revolving door of sunburnt tourists, demanding outlandish hairstyles and complaining about the humidity. Bernie loved the beach, the salt air, the laid-back vibe... but sometimes, she just longed for a quiet, landlocked life, far, far away from glittery nail polish and the tyranny of perfectly highlighted hair. Tonight, however, she had promised herself, would be different. Tonight, she wasn't going home. Tonight, she was diving headfirst into trouble, and hopefully, a little bit of excitement, at the annual Neptune Beach Neptune Pageant. And that, she thought, cracking a small, weary smile, was going to require more than just a fresh coat of lipstick.
