Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a cake decorator:

**Story Opening:**

The cloying sweetness of vanilla and buttercream hung thick in the air, a familiar comfort that usually soothed Amelia Beatrice Bellweather. But today, even the comforting scent couldn't quell the frantic flutter in her chest. Amelia wiped her brow with the back of her flour-dusted hand, smearing a streak of white across her forehead. The clock above the walk-in refrigerator ticked with malevolent precision, each second an echoing hammer blow against her mounting anxiety. In precisely three hours, Mrs. Abigail Worthington, the wealthiest and arguably the pickiest socialite in Oakhaven County, would be arriving to collect her daughter's wedding cake. And Amelia, despite weeks of planning and sleepless nights, was staring at a disaster.

**Setting:**

Amelia's story takes place in the small, picturesque town of Oakhaven, nestled in the rolling hills of upstate New York. The specific setting of this scene is "Sugar & Spice," Amelia's bustling, yet charming, bakery.

*   **Description of Sugar & Spice:** The bakery is located on Oakhaven's quaint Main Street, its robin's-egg blue facade a cheerful contrast to the brick buildings surrounding it. Inside, the air is perpetually fragrant with the scent of baking goods. Display cases gleam, filled with cupcakes adorned with intricate frosting roses, perfectly-layered pastries, and miniature cakes. A large chalkboard menu hangs behind the counter, listing the daily specials in swirling script. The back of the bakery houses the kitchen, a whirlwind of stainless steel counters, industrial mixers, and shelves overflowing with sprinkles, food coloring, and decorating tools. This is where Amelia crafts her edible masterpieces, and where, today, she is battling the remnants of a potential wedding cake catastrophe.
