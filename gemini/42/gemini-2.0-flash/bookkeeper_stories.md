## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights of "Accounts Aligned," a mid-sized bookkeeping firm nestled on the second floor of a drab office building in downtown Milwaukee, hummed a monotonous drone that mirrored the hum of life itself for Beatrice "Bea" Eleanor McMillan. Bea, a woman whose life was as meticulously balanced as her balance sheets, was staring intently at a spreadsheet shimmering on her monitor. The numbers, usually her solace, were blurring, swimming in a sea of red and black ink. It wasnâ€™t a typo; Bea was meticulous. It wasn't a missing decimal; she always double-checked. It was worse. Much worse.

The air in the small, cramped office, perpetually smelling faintly of stale coffee and impending tax deadlines, felt heavier than usual. Outside, the mournful whistle of a passing train echoed through the concrete canyons, a lonely sound that resonated with the unsettling feeling creeping up Bea's spine. She swiveled in her worn office chair, the springs groaning in protest, and looked out the narrow window. A flock of pigeons scattered from a nearby ledge, startled by something unseen. Bea watched them go, a knot of unease tightening in her stomach. Something was profoundly, undeniably, wrong. And Beatrice Eleanor McMillan, a woman who found comfort in order and precision, was suddenly facing the most disorderly and imprecise mystery of her life.
