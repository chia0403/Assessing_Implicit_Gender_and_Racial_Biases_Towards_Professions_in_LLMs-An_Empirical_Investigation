The fluorescent lights of the hospital hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Eleanor Maeve Harrington's afternoon. Eleanor, a registered dietitian, stood at the foot of Mr. Hendersonâ€™s bed, a half-eaten tray of chicken broth and lukewarm mashed potatoes perched precariously on the bedside table. Mr. Henderson, a man built like a linebacker even in his current frail state, glared at the offending meal with the resentment usually reserved for parking tickets and telemarketers.

"Honestly, Eleanor, this stuff tastes like wallpaper paste mixed with sadness," he grumbled, his voice raspy from weeks of lying prone.

Eleanor sighed inwardly. This was her daily battlefield: fighting against bland, low-sodium, low-fat hospital food that was scientifically designed to heal but emotionally designed to depress. St. Jude's General Hospital, nestled in the heart of bustling Chicago, was a labyrinth of linoleum floors, antiseptic smells, and well-meaning but often unpalatable dietary restrictions. She loved her job, really. She loved helping people regain their health through proper nutrition. But sometimes, she felt like she was waging a war against flavor itself. And flavor, Eleanor firmly believed, was a crucial part of healing.
