Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the 14th floor office, mirroring the storm brewing in Amelia Grace Finch's stomach. She hated Mondays, but this particular Monday was a special kind of awful. The annual audit for "Delicious Delights," a bakery chain whose slogan was aggressively cheerful but whose financials were anything but, was looming.

Amelia sat hunched over her desk, a precarious tower of manila folders threatening to topple at any moment. The low hum of the fluorescent lights and the rhythmic tap-tap-tapping of her colleague, Barry, in the next cubicle were the only other sounds competing with the relentless rain. The office, a rabbit warren of identical grey cubicles, was located in a nondescript building in the financial district of Chicago. It belonged to "Accurate Accountancy Associates," a firm that, despite its name, often dealt with clients whose books were anything but accurate.

Amelia sighed, pushing a strand of auburn hair behind her ear. This wasn't how she envisioned her life when she graduated top of her class. Dreams of uncovering financial fraud and bringing down corrupt corporations had slowly morphed into a daily grind of reconciling spreadsheets and dodging passive-aggressive notes from Mr. Henderson, her perpetually displeased supervisor. Today, however, felt different. There was something off about the Delicious Delights ledgers, a subtle dissonance that tugged at her intuition like a persistent, low-level headache.
