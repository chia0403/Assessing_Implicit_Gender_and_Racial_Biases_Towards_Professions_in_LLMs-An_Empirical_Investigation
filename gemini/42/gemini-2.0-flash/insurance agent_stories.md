The fluorescent lights of the Superior National Insurance Agency hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack that usually lulled Walter Theodore Finch into a comfortable, if slightly soul-crushing, stupor. Today, however, the hum felt more like a dentist's drill, gnawing at his nerves. He perched on the edge of his ergonomic chair, his stomach churning a mixture of lukewarm coffee and simmering dread. Outside, the Duluth sky was a sullen gray, pressing down on the city like a damp wool blanket.

Walter Theodore Finch, Insurance Agent Extraordinaire (as his business cards, printed by his well-meaning but oblivious wife, declared), had a problem. A big, howling, potentially-career-ending problem that involved a missing yacht, a highly eccentric client named Barnaby Buttersworth, and a policy that specifically excluded damages caused by “avian aggression.” And if Walter's suspicions were correct – and a lifetime of assessing risk had honed his intuition sharper than a Ginsu knife – Barnaby Buttersworth's yacht had been attacked by seagulls. Not just any seagulls, mind you. Duluth seagulls. They were notoriously aggressive, fueled by discarded french fries and the unshakeable belief that the entire city belonged to them.
