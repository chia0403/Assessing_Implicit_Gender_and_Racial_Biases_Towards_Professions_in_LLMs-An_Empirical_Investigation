The rhythmic clatter of Beatrice Eleanor Hawthorne's ancient Smith Corona was a familiar lullaby in the otherwise silent offices of P. Grimshaw & Sons, Purveyors of Fine Teas. The setting sun cast long, dusty fingers through the grimy windows of the building, illuminating the swirling motes of dust that perpetually danced in the air. It was 6:07 PM, precisely seventeen minutes past Beatrice's designated clock-out time, but Mr. Grimshaw, the third "Son" and a man whose face perpetually resembled a prune left too long in the sun, had dropped a hefty stack of correspondence on her desk just as she was reaching for her handbag. The letters, addressed to various tea brokers across the country, needed typing, copying, and stamping before morning, and Beatrice, a woman of unflinching, if begrudging, loyalty, was resigned to her fate. She sighed, adjusted her spectacles, and continued to hammer away at the keys, the words "Darjeeling First Flush" bouncing off the walls like echoes of a life she desperately wanted to escape.
