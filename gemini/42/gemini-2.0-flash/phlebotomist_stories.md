Okay, here's a story opening, including the setting and introduction of the main character:

**Setting:** The pre-dawn gloom clung to the grimy windows of the "Get Well Soon" Urgent Care in a strip mall on the edge of Reno, Nevada. The air inside, perpetually smelling of disinfectant and stale coffee, hummed with the barely-restrained anxiety that came with knowing something was wrong, but not knowing exactly what. Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, fighting a losing battle against the lingering darkness.

**Opening:**

The clatter of keys echoed through the near-empty urgent care as Serena Marie Rodriguez unlocked the back door.  The security alarm chirped a resentful protest before she disarmed it with practiced ease.  Another day, another sunrise she wouldn't see. She sighed, the weight of it settling on her shoulders like a lead apron. Serena was a phlebotomist, a blood-drawing artist in this small corner of the desert. She hung her worn denim jacket on a hook near the time clock, the embroidered sunflower on the back a small, defiant splash of cheer in the sterile environment. A quick check in the mirror confirmed her own tired reflection, dark circles under her kind brown eyes. "Alright, Serena," she murmured, adjusting her braided hair, "time to draw some blood, and maybe, just maybe, draw a little hope, too."
