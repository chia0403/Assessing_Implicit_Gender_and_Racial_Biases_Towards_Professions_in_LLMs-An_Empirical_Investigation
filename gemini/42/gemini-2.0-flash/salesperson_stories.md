## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The stale, air-conditioned office of "Acme Insurance - Greater Springfield Branch" in mid-July. Desks, partitioned by low, fabric-covered walls, stretched out like beige tombstones in a poorly planned cemetery. Fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune, battling against the rhythmic click-clack of keyboards. Outside, a sweltering heatwave shimmered off the asphalt, but inside, it was a constant, slightly depressing 72 degrees.

**Opening:**

Amelia Claire Kensington stared, bleary-eyed, at the screen saver displaying a photo of a tropical beach, the kind they promised as a bonus for hitting quota in Q1. Q1, back when the world feltâ€¦ manageable. She sipped the last dregs of lukewarm coffee, the taste doing little to fight off the creeping dread that had settled in her stomach. Today was Thursday. Two more days until the end of the month. Two more days to reach the impossible sales target her new manager, a man named Chet with a comb-over that defied gravity, had implemented with the cheerful enthusiasm of a sociopath. Amelia Claire Kensington, Employee of the Month five times running before Chet arrived, was now staring down the barrel of her first ever quota miss. And that tropical beach? Seemed further away than ever. The phone rang, its shrill tone cutting through the monotonous hum of the office. Amelia hesitated, then plastered on her most winning smile (a smile that, she suspected, was starting to resemble a grimace) and picked it up. "Acme Insurance, this is Amelia Claire Kensington, how can I brighten your day?"
