## Story Opening:

The rhythmic thrum of the dehumidifier was the only sound that cut through the pre-dawn stillness. Amelia Grace Peterson shivered, pulling her worn, floral-patterned robe tighter around herself as she entered the treatment room. A pale wash of light filtered through the frosted window, just enough to illuminate the familiar shapes: the plush massage table, draped in a clean, crisp sheet; the small, neatly organized shelf overflowing with essential oils; the comforting warmth of the electric blanket preheating beneath the sheet.

Today was going to be a long one. Amelia had squeezed in an extra client, a new runner who was battling what felt like an impenetrable knot in his right hamstring. She could practically feel his pain already, the phantom aches that always seemed to seep into her own muscles after a particularly tense session.

She glanced at the digital clock on the wall - 5:17 AM. Time to brew the chamomile tea. She always offered it to her first clients of the day, a ritual that felt as much for her own peace of mind as it was for theirs. The scent, she hoped, would chase away the chill and create a sense of calm, a necessary prelude to the work she was about to do, the work she was meant to do.

## Setting:

Amelia Grace Peterson owns and operates "The Healing Touch," a small, intimate massage therapy practice located in a quiet, revitalizing neighbourhood of Charleston, South Carolina. The practice is situated on the ground floor of a charming, two-story building with faded pastel blue siding and a wide, inviting porch adorned with hanging ferns and rocking chairs. Inside, the space is meticulously curated to evoke a sense of serenity. The walls are painted a soothing sage green, and soft, instrumental music is always playing. The waiting area features comfortable wicker chairs, a small bookshelf filled with wellness magazines and books on aromatherapy, and a small table displaying local artisan-made soaps and bath salts. The treatment room itself is sparsely decorated, emphasizing clean lines and a clutter-free environment. The aroma of lavender and eucalyptus hangs gently in the air, creating a sanctuary for both Amelia and her clients. The overall atmosphere is one of warmth, professionalism, and a genuine commitment to holistic well-being.
