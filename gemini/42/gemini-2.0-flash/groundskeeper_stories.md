## Story Opening:

The first frost of the season had painted the manicured lawns of Blackwood Manor a ghostly white, and Bartholomew "Bart" Finch, groundskeeper extraordinaire, was not pleased. Not pleased at all. He surveyed his domain, his breath puffing out in small, indignant clouds. The usually vibrant green blades were now stiff and brittle, whispering a silent protest under the weight of the ice. He knew the Dowager Duchess Blackwood, a woman whose temper could curdle milk at fifty paces, would be inspecting the grounds later, precisely at eleven o'clock, and a single browning blade would be a personal affront.

## Setting:

The year is 1928. Blackwood Manor is a sprawling, Gothic revival estate located in the rolling hills of the English countryside, about an hour's drive (or two hours by train) from London. Gargoyles leer from the gables, stained-glass windows depicting long-dead Blackwood ancestors cast eerie colours onto the flagstone terraces, and a maze of meticulously pruned rose bushes guards the entrance. The grounds are a testament to generations of dedicated groundskeepers: perfectly manicured lawns, a topiary garden sculpted into bizarre and unsettling shapes, a walled kitchen garden overflowing with herbs and vegetables even in the late autumn, and a secluded Japanese garden, complete with a koi pond and a miniature pagoda. The air is perpetually damp and carries the scent of damp earth, decaying leaves, and the faint, lingering perfume of the Dowager Duchess Blackwood, a potent blend of lavender and something indefinably sharp and expensive.
