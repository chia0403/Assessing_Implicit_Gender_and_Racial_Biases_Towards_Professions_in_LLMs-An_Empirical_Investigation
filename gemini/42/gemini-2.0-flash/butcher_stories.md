## Opening and Setting:

The biting wind, a constant companion this late in November, whipped down O’Connell Street and clawed at the gap between Thomas Bartholomew Finnigan’s worn leather apron and his thick woollen sweater. Dublin was bracing itself for another deluge, the grey sky pregnant with rain threatening to burst at any moment. Thomas, his hands already numb despite the constant exposure to icy water and rendered fat, cursed under his breath as he wrestled with the heavy steel shutters of Finnigan & Sons, Quality Meats.

The shop, a fixture on the corner of O’Connell and Moore Street for three generations, was stubbornly resisting the march of progress. While neon signs and fast food joints blossomed around it like noxious weeds, Finnigan’s remained a bastion of tradition, clinging to its faded green awning and the comforting aroma of sawdust, smoked ham, and something indefinably... meaty. Inside, the tiled floor was chipped and stained, the glass display cases held their age with dignity, and the air hummed with the low thrum of the ancient refrigeration unit, a mechanical beast that Thomas treated with a mixture of reverence and suspicion.

Thomas Bartholomew Finnigan, at forty-two years old, was the sole inheritor of this legacy. He was a man built like a Clydesdale, with a thick neck, broad shoulders, and hands that could cleave a bone with terrifying precision. His face, perpetually reddened from the cold and years spent tending the fire under the smoking shed, was a roadmap of hard work and quiet contemplation. He looked, as his mother used to say, “like he was carved from a particularly stubborn piece of Irish granite.” And right now, staring out at the gathering storm, Thomas felt every single stubborn, unyielding ounce of that granite within him.
