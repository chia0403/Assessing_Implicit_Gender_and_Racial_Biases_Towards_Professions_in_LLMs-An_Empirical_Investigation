Okay, here's a story opening and setting, with a guard named as the main character:

**Story Opening & Setting:**

The Mistwood clung to the castle walls like a damp, skeletal hand. It was a wood of whispers and shadows, of stunted oaks and thorn-choked paths that only the bravest – or the foolhardy – dared to tread. Every rustle of leaves, every hoot of an owl, sounded amplified in the pre-dawn gloom that perpetually shrouded Warden’s Keep. And every sound made Sergeant Elias Thorne's knuckles tighten around the worn hilt of his sword.

Elias exhaled, a plume of frosty breath clouding the air before him. He'd been pacing the battlements for what felt like an eternity, the rough stone cold against his worn leather boots. Another night, another uneventful patrol. That’s what they all were, these days. Uneventful. Boring. Some of the younger guards complained about the monotony, longed for the days of skirmishes and bandit raids. Elias, however, knew the quiet was a blessing, a fragile peace purchased with vigilance and a wall of steel. He'd seen enough violence in his youth to last a lifetime.

But tonight, something felt different. A prickling unease settled in his gut, a feeling as old and familiar as the Mistwood itself. It wasn’t the wind; the air was still, heavy with the scent of damp earth and decay. It wasn’t the usual nocturnal creatures; even the owls seemed to have fallen silent. No, it was something else. Something watching. Something waiting.

Elias stopped his pacing and leaned against the crenelation, his gaze fixed on the shadowy edge of the wood. The first sliver of dawn was just beginning to paint the eastern sky a bruised purple, but the Mistwood remained stubbornly dark, a swirling canvas of secrets. He scanned the trees, his eyes searching for any sign of movement, any glint of metal, any telltale flicker that betrayed an unseen presence.

He saw nothing.

Yet the feeling persisted, growing stronger with each passing moment. Tonight, the peace of Warden's Keep felt paper-thin, ready to tear at the slightest touch. And Elias Thorne knew, with a certainty that chilled him to the bone, that something wicked was coming.
