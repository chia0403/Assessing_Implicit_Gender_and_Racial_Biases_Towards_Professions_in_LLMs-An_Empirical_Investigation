The chipped, robin's egg blue paint of the classroom walls seemed to mock Ms. Genevieve Eleanor Ainsworth’s chipper mood. It had been ten years since they’d last updated the color scheme in Room 212, and a decade of teenage graffiti, smudged handprints, and the lingering scent of stale pizza had taken its toll. Still, Genevieve loved it. This room, tucked away on the less-trafficked east wing of Northwood High School, was her sanctuary. It held the ghosts of countless literary debates, the hushed whispers of nervous presentations, and the boisterous laughter that followed particularly disastrous pop quizzes.

Northwood High, a sprawling brick behemoth that looked more like a penitentiary than a place of learning, stood on the outskirts of the sleepy, somewhat forgotten town of Havenwood, Ohio. Havenwood had seen better days; the steel mill that had once sustained its economy had long since shuttered, leaving behind a trail of unemployment and a lingering sense of faded glory. The school, despite its age, was the heart of the community, a place where dreams, however ambitious or humble, were nurtured and occasionally, miraculously, realized.

Outside, a November wind howled, rattling the loose window frames and pelting the glass with icy rain. The sky was a dismal, unwavering grey, a perfect match for the general atmosphere that hung over Havenwood during the long Ohio winters. Inside, however, Genevieve was determined to inject a little warmth. She had a new batch of freshmen coming in for their first lesson on Romantic poetry, and she planned to charm them with Wordsworth, dazzle them with Shelley, and perhaps, just perhaps, ignite a tiny spark of literary passion within their young, cynical hearts.
