## Story Opening:

The scent of rosewater and regret hung heavy in the air, clinging to the velvet drapes of the atelier like a forlorn lover. Seraphina Rose Moreau, her fingers perpetually stained with the indigo of midnight dye, pricked her thumb for perhaps the hundredth time that morning. A bead of crimson bloomed against the soft linen, a stark reminder of the blood, sweat, and tears she’d poured into her latest creation – a gown destined for the plump, grasping shoulders of Lady Beatrice Worthington.

Seraphina sighed, the sound lost in the gentle whir of her antique Singer sewing machine. She hated making dresses for the Worthingtons. They possessed all the grace of a startled cow and expected a miracle transformation from silk and lace. 

Her gaze drifted from the offending garment to the window, where the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the cobbled courtyard of the Rue des Tournesols. She longed to be out there, breathing the crisp autumn air, instead of trapped in this gilded cage of her own making. But Atelier Moreau, though born from a desperate need, had become her lifeline, her prison, and, if she was honest with herself, her most prized possession.

## Setting:

**Atelier Moreau, Paris, 1888.**

Located on a quiet side street, the Rue des Tournesols, Atelier Moreau is tucked between a bustling bakery and a purveyor of fine wines. From the outside, it appears unassuming, its facade painted a muted grey, with only a discreet sign bearing its name in elegant gold lettering above the door.

Inside, however, is a world of opulent fabrics, delicate lace, and the clatter of creation. Sunlight streams through large windows, illuminating bolts of silk, velvet, and taffeta in a rainbow of hues. Mannequins draped in half-finished gowns stand like silent muses, scattered amongst worktables cluttered with spools of thread, scissors, and pincushions bristling with needles.

The atelier is divided into two distinct areas. The front room, a carefully curated space designed to impress discerning clientele, features comfortable velvet chairs, ornate mirrors, and display cases showcasing Seraphina’s most stunning creations. The back room, however, is Seraphina's personal domain – a chaotic but comforting space where she designs, cuts, and sews, surrounded by the tools of her trade and the ghosts of past inspirations. The air here is thick with the scent of fabric dye, beeswax, and the faint, lingering aroma of rosewater, a personal touch Seraphina adds to every garment she creates.
