The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the cramped kitchen of the "Golden Spoon," a greasy spoon diner clinging precariously to the edge of the sprawling industrial district.  Steam from the simmering stew pot curled upwards, mingling with the acrid scent of frying onions and the faint perfume of Beatrice “Bea”  Featherstone’s lavender-scented cooking oil.

The rhythmic clinking of metal on metal echoed around her as she expertly flipped a stack of sizzling pancakes, her movements precise and practiced. Tonight, the diner was unusually quiet, the usual lunchtime rush replaced by an unsettling stillness that settled over the room like a suffocating blanket.  The clatter of cutlery had ceased, leaving only the hiss of steam and the steady rhythmic thump of Bea's heart against her ribs.
