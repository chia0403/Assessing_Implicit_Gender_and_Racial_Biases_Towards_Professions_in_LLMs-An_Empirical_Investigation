The chipped paint of the Dewey Decimal System sign, a faded, almost-invisible emerald green, seemed to mock Elara Genevieve Blackwood as she dusted the spines of the forgotten novels in the back stacks of the Alderwood Public Library.  Sunlight, filtered through the grimy, leaded windows, painted the shelves in a kaleidoscope of shifting gold and amethyst.  Dust motes danced in the air, illuminating tiny constellations of paper and glue.  The scent of aged paper, mingled with the faint aroma of something faintly sweet and almost metallic, hung heavy in the air.  It was a scent Elara, with her years of cataloging and quiet contemplation, recognized as the whisper of time itself.

Alderwood, a town nestled deep within the Cascade foothills, was a place of weathered clapboard houses and winding, tree-lined streets.  The library, a squat, Victorian building with a sloping roof and a perpetually creaking front door, was the heart of the town.  It pulsed with the quiet rhythm of hushed whispers and rustling pages, a haven from the relentless march of the outside world.  Today, however, the rhythm was off-key.  A persistent, unsettling hum, akin to the buzzing of unseen wings, had accompanied the metallic scent.  Elara felt it in the tremor in her fingers as she brushed the dust from a leather-bound volume titled "The Secrets of the Whispering Woods."
