The chipped paint of the easel, a faded ochre against the muted grey of the studio walls, mirrored the weariness in Amelia "Anya" Blackwood's eyes.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grime-coated window, illuminating a canvas sprawled across the easel.  It depicted a gnarled, wind-swept oak, its branches reaching like skeletal fingers towards a bruised, lavender sky.  The scene was Anyaâ€™s latest attempt to capture the desolation that had settled over her small, forgotten town of Oakhaven, a town where time seemed to have stood still, clinging to the edges of memory like the clinging ivy that choked the forgotten stone walls.

Oakhaven, nestled in a valley cradled by towering, mist-shrouded mountains, had always held a melancholy beauty, a beauty Anya both loved and loathed.  The air hung heavy with the scent of pine and damp earth, a scent that clung to the cobbled streets and the decaying facades of the houses, whispering tales of a past grandeur.  The town, once a bustling hub of trade, now dwindled to a handful of weathered souls, their lives as quiet and unassuming as the whispering pines.  Anya's studio, a converted carriage house at the edge of the town square, was her sanctuary, her prison. Her only solace was in the act of creation, in the act of wresting beauty from the decay around her.
