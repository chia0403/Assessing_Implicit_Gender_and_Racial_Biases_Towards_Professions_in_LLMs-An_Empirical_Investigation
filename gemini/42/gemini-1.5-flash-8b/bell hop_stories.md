The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the cobblestones of New York's lower Fifth Avenue.  Rain, a relentless curtain, hammered against the ornate awning of the Grand Astor Hotel.  Inside, amidst the hushed whispers and the clinking of silverware, stood Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, bellhop extraordinaire.  Barty, a young man with eyes the colour of a stormy sea and a perpetually surprised expression, polished a brass tray with a fervor that belied the oppressive chill seeping into the hotel's grand halls.  He was, as he often reminded himself, a man of the moment, his life a series of fleeting encounters, hurried deliveries, and the rhythmic clang of the hotel's bell. Tonight, however, felt different.  A sense of unease hung heavy in the air, a palpable tension that had nothing to do with the boisterous laughter from the dining room or the hushed conversations in the drawing room.  Tonight, something was amiss.
