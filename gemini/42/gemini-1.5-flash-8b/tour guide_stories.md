The biting wind whipped Amelia Nightingale's auburn hair across her face as she surveyed the sprawling, grey expanse of Hadrian's Wall.  October, the month of mists and melancholy, had arrived in earnest.  The wind, a persistent, mournful sound, echoed through the ruined Roman fortifications, carrying with it the whispers of centuries past.  Amelia, a twenty-eight-year-old tour guide with eyes the colour of stormy seas, adjusted her well-worn tweed jacket, trying to fend off the chill that had seeped into her bones.  Below, the winding, narrow path she’d chosen for her small group of history enthusiasts wound its way towards the imposing gate of Housesteads Fort. Her breath puffed out in white clouds against the leaden sky. This, her favourite section of the wall, was often overlooked, but tonight, she felt it held a particular, almost palpable, energy.  The setting sun, a bruised plum colour, painted the stones in hues of faded glory.  The chill air was thick with the scent of damp earth and heather, and the only sounds were the wind and the rustling of unseen creatures in the undergrowth.  Her job was to weave these ancient stones into a narrative, to breathe life back into the silent, stone sentinels. This group, she thought, however, had a particular, almost expectant silence.  Amelia wondered what secrets tonight’s tour might uncover.
