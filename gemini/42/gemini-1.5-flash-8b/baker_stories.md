The aroma of freshly baked sourdough, a symphony of yeasty tang and toasted nuts, hung thick in the air of the tiny Parisian bakery.  Sunlight, filtered through the grimy, flower-laden windowpanes of "Le Petit Pain," cast long, dancing shadows across the worn wooden tables.  Dust motes, illuminated by the rays, swirled like tiny, golden butterflies.  This was the world of  Elodie Dubois, baker extraordinaire, a woman whose hands, calloused and strong, knew the secrets whispered by flour and the subtle alchemy of yeast.  But today, the usual harmonious clatter of trays and the cheerful chatter of regulars were missing.  A heavy silence, thick as the buttery croissant dough cooling on the counter, settled over the bakery. Elodie, her brow furrowed in concern, meticulously measured a spoonful of honey into a bowl of bubbling batter.  The quiet was not the usual morning lull; it was pregnant with a foreboding that clung to the air like a lingering scent of woodsmoke.
