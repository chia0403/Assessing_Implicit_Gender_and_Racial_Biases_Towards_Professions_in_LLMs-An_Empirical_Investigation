The fluorescent hum of the museum, a constant, low thrumming, was the only sound accompanying Amelia Butterfield, the night janitor.  Dust motes danced in the pale light, reflecting off the polished floor like tiny, spectral fireflies.  Her worn, gray uniform, a familiar blur against the beige walls, swallowed her as she pushed a wheeled cart laden with cleaning supplies.  Tonight, the grand hall of the National Museum of Antiquities was hers alone, a hushed sanctuary bathed in the soft glow of the moon filtering through the high windows.  

The year was 2042.  The museum, a sprawling complex of glass and steel nestled within a sprawling urban park, felt ancient and timeless, though its architecture spoke of sleek modernism.  Once, its hallowed halls echoed with the footsteps of thousands. Now, only Ameliaâ€™s quiet movements broke the stillness.  The exhibits, once vibrant with the life of history, were now silent, the artifacts themselves seemingly listening to the unseen stories of the past.  Her job was to tend to this quiet silence, to preserve it, to ensure the treasures within slept undisturbed until the dawn.
