The biting wind, a razor-sharp claw, ripped at Elias Blackwood's worn flannel shirt.  He hunched deeper into the skeletal frame of the old logging truck, the diesel engine a low, rumbling heartbeat against the symphony of the encroaching storm.  Around him, the vast, pine-clad wilderness of the Cascade Mountains writhed in the tempest's fury.  Twisted branches, the size of small trees, lashed against the cab, a relentless drumming against the metal.  Snow, thick and relentless, fell like a gritty curtain, obscuring the already dim light.  The forest, usually a cathedral of green and gold, now raged in a furious, white dance.

Elias, his face etched with the lines of a thousand winters and the grime of a thousand felled trees, shivered not from the cold, but from a different kind of chill.  He wasn't afraid of the storm; he'd faced storms that would have swallowed lesser men whole. Thisâ€¦this was something else.  A knot of dread, tight as the rope in his calloused hand, tightened in his stomach.  He was alone, miles from the nearest logging camp, on a road lost in the maelstrom, and the silence that pressed in around him was heavier than the falling snow.
