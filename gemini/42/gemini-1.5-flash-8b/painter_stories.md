The scent of linseed oil and turpentine hung heavy in the air, a familiar blanket that draped over Amelia Hawthorne’s studio like a worn velvet cloak.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight piercing the grime-streaked window, illuminating a canvas propped precariously on an easel.  Amelia, a woman of thirty-five with eyes the colour of a stormy sea and hair the shade of midnight, was hunched over it, her brow furrowed in concentration.  The studio, tucked away in a forgotten corner of the crumbling Victorian district, was a testament to both her passion and her poverty.  Cobwebs hung like macabre lace from the chipped plaster walls, and the chipped paint on the worn wooden floor echoed the faded glories of the once-grand building.  A riot of colour, a kaleidoscope of half-finished paintings, and abandoned palettes, lay scattered across the cluttered space.  A persistent cough, a companion of her chronic bronchitis, punctuated the silence, a stark reminder of the toll her artistic pursuits took on her fragile body.  Outside, the relentless rhythm of the city – the clatter of horse-drawn carriages, the cries of street vendors – was a constant, almost oppressive presence, a stark contrast to the quiet desperation within the confines of her studio.
