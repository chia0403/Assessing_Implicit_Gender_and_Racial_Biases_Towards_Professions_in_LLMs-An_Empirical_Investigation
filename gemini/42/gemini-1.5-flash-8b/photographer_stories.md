The biting wind whipped Elara Vance's camera bag across her shoulders, the icy spray of the North Sea stinging her cheeks.  Grey, relentless clouds hung low over the jagged cliffs of the Shetland Isles, mirroring the storm brewing within her.  Each gust of wind seemed to carry with it a whisper of the past, a haunting melody echoing in the deserted fishing village of Scalloway, a place that held both the most stunning landscapes and the deepest sorrows Elara had ever encountered.  It was a place, she realised with a sudden chill that went beyond the physical temperature, she needed to capture.  Not just for the stunning light and colour, but for the stories buried beneath the weathered facades of the crumbling houses, the tales whispered on the wind.
