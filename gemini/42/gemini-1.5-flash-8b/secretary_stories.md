The chipped Formica countertop gleamed under the harsh fluorescent lights of the third-floor office, reflecting Amelia Blackwood's perpetually tired eyes.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the grime-coated window, illuminating a faded portrait of a stern-faced man in a pinstripe suit.  Amelia, a secretary of precisely average competence and extraordinary exhaustion at the prestigious Blackwood & Blackwood law firm, sighed, pushing a stack of manila envelopes across the surface.  Another Monday. Another mountain of legal documents to decipher, interpret, and hopefully arrange into something resembling order.

The office, a relic of a bygone era, felt stifling.  The air, thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, hung heavy in the stale silence, punctuated only by the rhythmic clack of Amelia's old typewriter and the occasional muffled shout from the chambers beyond.  Warmth from the radiators struggled to combat the icy chill that seemed to emanate from the very walls of the building. Outside, the grey London sky mirrored the relentless monotony of Amelia's life.  The year was 1938.
