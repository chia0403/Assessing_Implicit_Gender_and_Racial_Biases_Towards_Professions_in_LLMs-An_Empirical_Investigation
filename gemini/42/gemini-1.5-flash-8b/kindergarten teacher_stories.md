The chipped paint of the kindergarten classroom, a faded robin's egg blue, seemed to hum with a low, expectant thrum.  Sunlight, filtered through the dusty windowpanes, painted the room in shifting patterns of gold and amber.  Ms. Amelia Hawthorne, a kindergarten teacher with eyes the colour of warm honey and a smile that could melt glaciers, surveyed her domain.  A flurry of pastel-colored drawings, depicting fantastical creatures and towering castles, covered the tables.  Crayon shavings, like tiny, iridescent confetti, dusted the air.  The rhythmic thump-thump-thump of tiny feet on the worn linoleum floor echoed in the sudden silence that followed a particularly boisterous game of "trucks."  This was Amelia's fifth year at Maplewood Elementary, and this particular Tuesday morning felt both familiar and utterly, beautifully new.
