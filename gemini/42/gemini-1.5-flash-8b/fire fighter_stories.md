The biting wind whipped at Amelia "Em" Hawthorne's crimson fire-retardant jacket, stinging her cheeks with icy needles.  Dust devils danced across the cracked asphalt of the abandoned lot, swirling the crimson dust into a hazy, apocalyptic haze.  The rusted skeleton of a once-grand warehouse, its skeletal remains clawing at the bruised twilight sky, loomed before her like a skeletal hand reaching for the heavens.  This was no ordinary fire.  This was a conflagration of a different kind, a fire fueled not by embers and gasoline, but by something far more insidious and pervasive.  The air itself seemed to crackle with an unnatural energy, a low hum resonating deep within her bones. Em felt it, a tremor that mirrored the tremor in the ground, a tremor of something ancient and terrible stirring beneath the forgotten concrete.

**Setting:** The abandoned industrial district of Veridian, a sprawling, neglected suburb on the outskirts of a major city.  The area, once a hub for bustling factories and warehouses, now lay rotting, a testament to the city's relentless expansion outwards.  Grimy, crumbling buildings, overgrown with weeds and choked by rusting metal, jostled with each other for space.   The skeletal remains of rusted machinery and forgotten tools lay scattered like tombstones amongst the overgrown, vacant lots. The air, perpetually thick with the scent of decay and exhaust fumes, was now laced with a strangely acrid, metallic odor.  A chill, deeper than any winter wind, permeated the area, a coldness that seemed to seep into the very marrow of the soul.
