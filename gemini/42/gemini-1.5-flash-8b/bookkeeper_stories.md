The chipped Formica counter gleamed under the fluorescent lights of the "Numbers & Nibs" bookkeeping service.  Dust motes danced in the beams, illuminating the meticulously organized stacks of receipts, invoices, and tax forms that filled the small, cramped office.  Amelia "Amy" Cartwright, meticulously dressed in a faded but perfectly pressed navy blazer and sensible beige trousers, traced the ledger with a ballpoint pen, her brow furrowed in concentration.  The rhythmic click-click-click of the pen against the paper was the only sound that broke the quiet hum of the fluorescent lights and the faint, distant rumble of city traffic.  Outside, the grey November sky mirrored the muted tones of the office, promising another day swallowed by the relentless grind of paperwork.

Amy, a bookkeeper of twenty-three years and an expert at deciphering the cryptic language of numbers, was grappling with a particularly thorny client â€“ the perpetually late, perpetually disorganized, and perpetually overwhelmed Mrs. Evangeline Thistlewick, owner of "Thistlewick's Teas & Treats."  Each month, the ledger for Mrs. Thistlewick's business mirrored the chaotic nature of her shop, a bewildering tapestry of handwritten notes, sticky receipts, and cryptic doodles alongside perfectly-kept invoices and neatly-folded supplier lists. Amy suspected that, underneath the disarray, Mrs. Thistlewick held a heart of gold, a gold that was becoming increasingly tarnished by the weight of her own entrepreneurial endeavors.
