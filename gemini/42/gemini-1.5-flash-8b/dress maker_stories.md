The scent of beeswax and simmering chamomile hung heavy in the air of Amelia Blackwood's atelier, a tiny space crammed with bolts of silk, shimmering satins, and heaps of intricate lace.  Sunlight, fractured by the stained-glass window depicting a celestial tapestry, painted shifting patterns on the dust motes dancing in the air.  Amelia, a woman of thirty-two with eyes the colour of faded amethyst and hands perpetually stained a delicate shade of indigo, meticulously pinned a layer of delicate Valenciennes lace to a silk gown. The faintest strains of a distant street musician drifted through the open window, a melancholic melody that seemed to echo the sigh of the fabric beneath her fingertips.  This was her sanctuary, her workshop, the heart of her world, a world painstakingly woven from thread, imagination, and a quiet, unwavering determination.
