The fluorescent hum of the trading floor vibrated through Elias Thorne's bones, a constant, low thrumming that mirrored the frantic energy swirling around him.  New York, a concrete jungle pulsating with a thousand different rhythms, seemed to have pressed its own frenetic pace directly onto his shoulders.

Elias, a stockbroker at the prestigious firm of  "Apex Capital," was drowning in a sea of red numbers.  His crisp white shirt, usually a symbol of his polished composure, was now damp with sweat.  The aroma of burnt coffee and stale pretzels hung heavy in the air, a grim olfactory representation of the market's current volatile mood.  Outside, the city roared, a symphony of sirens and honking taxis, a jarring counterpoint to the hushed whispers and hurried footsteps within the trading floor.  He was, quite literally, buried beneath a mountain of pending trades, each one a potential gamble on the future of a company, an industry, even a nation.
