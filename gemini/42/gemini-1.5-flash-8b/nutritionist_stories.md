The biting London fog, a thick, grey shroud clinging to the cobbled streets, swirled around Amelia "Amy" Nightingale as she hurried towards her clinic.  The air, usually thick with the perfume of blooming jasmine in the summer, now carried the sharp tang of damp earth and the faint, sickly sweet smell of something decaying.  She clutched a thermos of chamomile tea, its warmth a small comfort against the chill.  Amy Nightingale, a registered dietitian with a penchant for meticulous record-keeping and a surprisingly rebellious streak, considered the peculiarity of the day's appointment.  Her client, renowned architect Alistair Finch, known for his avant-garde designs and even more avant-garde dietary choices, had requested an emergency consultation.

The clinic itself, nestled in a quiet side street off Regent's Park, was a testament to Amy's personality.  Instead of sterile white walls, vibrant hues of ochre and teal painted the walls, offset by polished wooden furniture.  A small, herb garden thrived in a corner, a testament to Amy's belief that nutrition was about more than just numbers on a chart.   Sunlight, fighting its way through the oppressive fog, cast dancing shadows across the meticulously organized shelves stocked with fresh produce and exotic spices.  The aroma of turmeric and ginger filled the air, a stark contrast to the fog-laden street outside.  Today, however, even that comforting scent felt almost alien.
