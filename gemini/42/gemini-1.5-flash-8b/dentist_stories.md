The fluorescent lights of Dr. Eleanor Vance’s office hummed, a monotonous counterpoint to the rhythmic *tap-tap-tap* of her instruments on porcelain.  A single shaft of afternoon sun, filtered through the grime-coated window, illuminated dust motes dancing in the air.  The sterile smell of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, punctuated by the faint, metallic tang of blood.  Eleanor Vance, a woman whose sharp features seemed etched by years of meticulous work and countless anxieties, focused on the cavity in front of her, a small, festering wound in a young man's otherwise perfect smile.

The waiting room, a beige expanse of uncomfortable chairs and chipped Formica tables, offered a stark contrast to the precise order of the treatment room.  A single, faded magazine lay open on one table, its pages detailing a celebrity's lavish vacation.  Across the room, a child’s drawing, vibrant and crude, depicting a monstrous tooth-fairy, stared blankly ahead.  The silence, broken only by the low murmur of the city outside and the occasional sigh of a patient, felt thick and oppressive.

Eleanor, however, was oblivious to the world beyond the dental chair.  Her concentration was absolute, her mind a battlefield where the precision of her craft clashed with the unspoken anxieties of her patients.
