The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Precision Drafting Department" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Elara Vance's life.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of pale sunlight piercing the grimy window, illuminating the swirling patterns of graphite on the drafting table before her.  Her hands, calloused and stained with ink and a lifetime of technical precision, moved with practiced ease over the tracing paper, the intricate lines of a new hydraulic valve taking shape beneath her pencil.  Elara, a drafting worker for the colossal, perpetually-under-construction "Apex Industries," was a creature of precise lines and calculated measurements, a silent architect in a world of churning machinery and concrete.  

The air, thick with the smell of metal shavings and old paper, hung heavy and still.  Rows of drafting tables stretched out like orderly graves, each one occupied by a silent soul immersed in their own meticulous drawing.  Outside, the city of Aethelgard pulsed with a relentless rhythm – the roar of trams, the distant clang of steel, the persistent honking of motorized carriages – a symphony Elara only heard as a muted undercurrent.  She existed within the sterile, functional space of the drafting room, a sanctuary of lines and numbers, far from the chaos of the urban world outside.
