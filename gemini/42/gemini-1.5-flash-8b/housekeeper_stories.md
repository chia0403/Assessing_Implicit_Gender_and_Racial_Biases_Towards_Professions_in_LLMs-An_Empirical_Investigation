The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the polished mahogany floors of Blackwood Manor, illuminating dust motes that swirled in the air like tiny, spectral dancers.  Eleanor Ainsworth, her lavender-scented apron tied securely, swept a stray lock of auburn hair behind her ear.  The silence, punctuated only by the creaking of the ancient floorboards beneath her feet, felt thick, almost tangible.  This was her nightly ritual, a solitary dance with the ghosts of Blackwood Manor, a dance sheâ€™d performed for the past eight years.

Setting: Blackwood Manor, a sprawling, gothic estate nestled deep within the mist-shrouded Yorkshire moors.  Rain lashed against the leaded-glass windows, mirroring the relentless downpour that had been hammering against the manor walls all day. The scent of damp earth and decaying leaves hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint, almost imperceptible aroma of lilies.  Eleanor knew this house intimately, the hidden passages, the whispering rooms, the empty rooms filled with the lingering echoes of laughter and sorrow.  Every shadowed corner held a memory, each creak of the woodwork a whisper from the past.  The grand hall, usually bustling with the company of Lord Blackwood's numerous guests, was now eerily still. This particular night, even the usual comforting presence of the house's aging housekeeper, Mrs. Higgins, was absent.
