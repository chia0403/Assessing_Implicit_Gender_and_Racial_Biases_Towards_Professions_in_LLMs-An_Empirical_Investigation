The rain hammered against the warped planks of the shed heâ€™d fashioned from salvaged timbers, a haven of sorts against the relentless elements.  Inside, the rhythmic thump of his tools echoed strangely against the hollow space.  Tonight, however, the familiar sounds held an undercurrent of unease.
