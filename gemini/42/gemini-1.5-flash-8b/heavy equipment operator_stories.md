The rhythmic clang of the excavator's bucket against the stubborn earth vibrated through Bartholomew "Barty" Higgins's boots.  Dust, fine and gritty, coated everything â€“ his weathered face, the faded blue overalls clinging to his muscled frame, the scarred and sun-baked landscape that stretched out before him like a cracked, parched mouth.  The desert air, thick with the scent of sagebrush and something vaguely metallic, hung heavy and still.  He was alone, miles from the nearest town, a speck of humanity swallowed by the vast expanse of the Arizona badlands.

Barty, 42 years old, was a heavy equipment operator, a master of the machines that sculpted the earth.  His hands, calloused and strong, knew the language of levers and hydraulics, the subtle nuances of metal groaning and groaning in protest. He'd spent a lifetime working in this unforgiving terrain, shaping canyons and carving roads from rock, and the silence, punctuated only by the groaning of his massive piece of equipment, was a familiar companion.  Today, however, a different kind of silence pressed down, a foreboding stillness that had nothing to do with the desert's usual quietude.
