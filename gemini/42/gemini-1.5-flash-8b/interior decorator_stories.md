The biting London wind whipped Amelia Fairfax's crimson scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks as she navigated the narrow, cobbled alleyway.  Dust motes danced in the weak sunlight filtering through the grimy brick buildings.  This was not the pristine, polished world of her elegant Mayfair showroom, “Amelia Fairfax Designs.” This was the grittier, more challenging side of the city, the heart of the Spitalfields district, a neighborhood whispering tales of lost fortunes and burgeoning creativity.  Amelia, a whirlwind of energy in her tailored, navy coat, was on a mission.  A mission that, if successful, would redefine not just a room, but a life.

Her client, a reclusive artist named  Elias Thorne, lived in a converted warehouse, a sprawling, atmospheric space that seemed to have been swallowed whole by the fog.  Amelia had only seen sketches and a few scant photographs of the interior, but the aura of the place, the raw beauty and neglect, intrigued her.  Elias Thorne was reputed to be a visionary, a painter who saw the world in shades of muted blues and deep greens.  This, she hoped, would make for an interesting decorating challenge.  The challenge was to transform the warehouse into a sanctuary where his art could breathe, a testament to his artistic soul.  But Elias was also described as a man of few words, a recluse, and Amelia wondered if she could decipher the whispers within the walls and understand what he truly desired.
