The fluorescent lights of the high school hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to the anxieties swirling in Dr. Eleanor Vance's chest.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun slanting through the grimy windowpanes of Room 214, illuminating the chaotic tableau of crumpled papers, half-eaten granola bars, and the ubiquitous scent of stale coffee and despair.  Eleanor, a school psychologist with five years under her belt, felt the familiar knot tightening in her stomach.  Another Monday, another avalanche of teenage angst and academic struggles.  The posters on the walls – motivational quotes, inspirational slogans – seemed ironically detached, their bright colours unable to pierce the gloom settling over the students.  She took a slow, deep breath, the familiar scent of antiseptic clinging to her scrubs, and adjusted the strap of her worn leather satchel.  It was a typical Monday in the bustling, underfunded public high school in the heart of the Rust Belt town of Havenwood, where societal pressures felt as tangible as the industrial haze hanging over the city.
