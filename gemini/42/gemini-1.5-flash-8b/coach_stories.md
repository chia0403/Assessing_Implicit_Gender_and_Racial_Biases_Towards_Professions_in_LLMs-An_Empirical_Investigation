The biting wind whipped across the desolate, snow-covered expanse of the High Peaks, stinging Amelia Blackwood's cheeks.  Below, the tiny village of Oakhaven huddled like a frightened rabbit beneath the encroaching blizzard, its lights flickering like distant embers.  Amelia, a grizzled but surprisingly agile woman in her late 40s, hunched deeper into her parka.  The roar of the gale seemed to echo the frantic rhythm of her own heart.  She was the coach of the Oakhaven Wolverines, a small, but fiercely competitive, high school hockey team, and tonight's game against the formidable Northwind Dragons was more than just a match; it was a lifeline for the entire town.  The Dragons, renowned for their ruthless aggression and relentless pursuit of victory, had a formidable reputation that chilled even the most hardened athlete. This season, every game had been a struggle, and the pressure to win against such an established rival felt heavier than the weight of the falling snow.  The game was scheduled for the remote ice rink, perched precariously on the mountainside, a place of both beauty and terrifying isolation.
