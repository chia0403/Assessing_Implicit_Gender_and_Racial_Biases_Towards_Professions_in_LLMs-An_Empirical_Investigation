The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow across Amelia Nightingale's face, highlighting the weariness etched into her features.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, mimicking the insistent drumming of her own thoughts.  Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of stale beer and desperation.  Amelia, a woman whose age was best guessed at by the faint lines around her eyes and the practiced ease with which she navigated the crowded bar, wiped down a sticky mahogany bar top.  Each polished swish of her rag echoed the quiet hum of discontent swirling around her.  The dimly lit saloon, located in the forgotten corner of Havenwood, a town clinging precariously to the edge of the Rust Belt, felt like a suffocating embrace.  Broken bottles littered the floor beneath the scarred wooden tables, forgotten relics of drunken arguments and whispered secrets.  Tonight, however, the only sounds were the rhythmic clinking of glasses and the steady drip, drip, drip of the rain.
