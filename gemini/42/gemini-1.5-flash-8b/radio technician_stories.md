The flickering neon sign of the "Radio Shack of the Rockies" cast a sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked alley.  Water pooled around Amelia "Milly"  Jenkins' boots, mirroring the static crackle emanating from the battered shortwave radio in her hands.  Tonight's forecast, a blizzard threatening to bury the small mining town of Copper Creek, was relayed with more hiss than signal.  Milly, her greasy hair escaping its hastily tied bun, swore under her breath.  This was her tenth attempt to make contact with the emergency beacon on the mountaintop, and the signal was as weak as a dying ember.

The Radio Shack, tucked behind a row of dilapidated saloons and a general store selling dubious remedies, was a cramped space filled with the pungent aroma of solder and aged electronics.  Dusty boxes overflowed with parts, their metal surfaces reflecting the harsh light of the single overhead bulb.  Cobwebs draped like mournful lace across the forgotten components, whispering stories of crackling broadcasts and forgotten calls.  From the workbench, a chipped ceramic mug filled with lukewarm coffee sat, a testament to Milly's long nights and equally long, frustrating attempts to restore the signal.  The rhythmic drumming of the rain against the corrugated metal roof was the only other sound in the store, apart from the occasional groan of the old building itself, each groan seeming to echo the weight of Copper Creek's precarious existence.  Outside, the wind howled, an angry beast trying to tear the town from its precarious grip on the mountainside.
