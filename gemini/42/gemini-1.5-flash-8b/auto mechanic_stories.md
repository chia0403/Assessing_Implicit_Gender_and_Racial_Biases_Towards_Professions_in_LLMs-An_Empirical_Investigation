The greasy haze hung heavy in the air, a perpetual twilight in the cluttered workshop of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield.  Fluorescent lights buzzed, their harsh glare reflecting off oil-slicked floors and the chrome-plated engine parts scattered across every available surface.  Barty, a wiry man with hands calloused from years of wrenching and hammering, leaned over a vintage Ford Model A, its engine block a pale grey-green under the grime.  He traced a calloused finger along the intricate carvings of the valve cover, his brow furrowed in concentration.  Outside, the relentless summer sun beat down on the dusty, sun-baked streets of Willow Creek, a small town clinging to the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains.  The only sound besides the rhythmic whir of the air compressor was the distant, mournful howl of a coyote, echoing through the silent canyons that ringed the town.  Barty, oblivious to the world beyond the walls of his workshop, was lost in the symphony of clangs and screeches that were the language of the vintage engines he loved.
