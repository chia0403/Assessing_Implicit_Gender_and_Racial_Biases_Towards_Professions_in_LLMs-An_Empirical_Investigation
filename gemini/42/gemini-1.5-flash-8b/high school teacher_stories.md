The chipped Formica countertop, stained a dull beige from years of lukewarm coffee and spilled textbooks, reflected the flickering fluorescent lights of Mrs. Eleanor Vance's classroom.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grime-coated windowpane, illuminating a half-eaten bag of pretzels and a stray highlighter near a overflowing recycling bin.  This was Ms. Vance’s sanctuary, her battlefield, and her quiet torment.  High school English, 2nd period, a Thursday.  The rhythmic thump-thump-thump of student feet in the hall was a constant, low hum that vibrated through the very floorboards.  Twelve pairs of teenage eyes, varying shades from the dull grey of boredom to the electric blue of outright disdain, stared back at her from the worn, mismatched desks.  Eleanor Vance, a woman of thirty-seven with a heart of gold and patience thinner than the school’s cafeteria trays, took a deep breath.  Another day, another battle against the relentless tide of teenage indifference.
