The chipped paint of the "Melody Mart" sign, peeling like sunburnt skin, offered little respite from the relentless desert sun beating down on the dusty town of Harmony Gulch.  Dust motes danced in the shimmering heat haze, obscuring the faded turquoise stucco buildings that clung to the parched earth like wilting flowers.  This was Amelia Nightingale's world, a place where the only music louder than the cicadas' incessant buzz was the rhythmic clatter of the rusty water pump at the town's edge.

Amelia Nightingale, a singer with a voice as dry and brittle as the desert air, stood perched on a weathered stool outside her tiny shop, "Nightingale's Melodies."  Inside, dusty sheet music and forgotten instruments – a battered ukulele, a tarnished harmonica, a chipped porcelain doll with a broken heart – lay scattered like scattered dreams.  Today, the only customer was a wizened old woman with eyes like chipped turquoise, sifting through a pile of forgotten vinyl records.  Amelia, her fingers tracing the faded pattern of a worn guitar string, hummed a quiet tune, a melody lost in the vast expanse of the desert.
