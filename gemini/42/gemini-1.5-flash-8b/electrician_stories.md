The flickering fluorescent lights of the abandoned factory hummed a mournful tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic clang of Amelia Blackwood's wrench against the rusted metal conduit.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of pale sunlight piercing the grimy expanse, illuminating the skeletal remains of machinery and the ghostly outlines of forgotten blueprints.  Amelia, a wiry woman with calloused hands and eyes that held the sharp focus of a hawk, was a master electrician, though her mastery was more often exercised in forgotten corners of the world, in places like this â€“ the decaying husk of the "Sunrise Industries" factory, rumored to be haunted by the whispers of its former glory.  Tonight, however, the whispers seemed less spectral and more concerned with the ominous crackle emanating from the old power grid.  Amelia's grease-stained overalls, her favorite vintage electrician's toolbelt, and the familiar weight of her worn leather gloves were her companions in this silent, industrial labyrinth. The air, thick with the smell of ozone and decay, hung heavy in the oppressive stillness. The night air carried a faint tang of something else, something acrid and almost metallic, a scent that sent a shiver of unease down Amelia's spine.
