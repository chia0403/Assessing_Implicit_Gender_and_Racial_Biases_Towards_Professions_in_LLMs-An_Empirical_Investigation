The biting wind whipped across the desolate expanse of the Yorkshire Moors, stinging Detective Sergeant Alistair Finchâ€™s cheeks.  Rain, relentless and grey, plastered his thick tweed coat to his body, mirroring the bleakness of the moor itself.  He hunched deeper into his worn, battered trench coat, the rhythmic crunch of his boots on the frozen ground the only sound besides the mournful howl of a distant curlew.  This wasn't the picturesque landscape tourists flocked to see; this was the heart of the wilderness, a place where whispers carried on the wind held secrets older than time itself.  Alistair, a man hardened by years of navigating the rougher edges of rural life, felt the weight of the unspoken pressing down on him as he surveyed the scene before him.

The setting:  A remote, isolated farmhouse, nestled deep within the Yorkshire Dales.  The property, known locally as "The Raven's Perch," was a crumbling edifice of stone and timber, its windows like vacant eyes staring out at the swirling mist.  Thickets of brambles and thorny bushes choked the overgrown garden, reaching towards the house like grasping fingers.  An unnatural stillness hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the fierce weather raging outside.  A single, flickering porch light cast long, skeletal shadows across the uneven ground.
