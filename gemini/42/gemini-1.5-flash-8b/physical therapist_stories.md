The biting wind whipped Amelia Kensington’s hair across her face as she adjusted the strap of her worn leather satchel.  The grey, perpetually overcast sky mirrored the mood in the small, coastal town of Alderbrook.  Rain, a relentless curtain, hammered against the corrugated iron roofs of the weathered houses, mirroring the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of her own heart, a steady drumbeat against the echoing silence.  Alderbrook clung to the craggy coastline, a place of stark beauty and persistent solitude, where the ocean’s roar often drowned out the whispers of human conversation. Amelia, a physical therapist with a practice tucked away in a charming, if somewhat dilapidated, building overlooking the harbour, felt the familiar weight of the town’s unspoken stories pressing down on her.  Each weathered house, each weathered face, held a secret, a pain, a story waiting to be unearthed, and she, Amelia Kensington, was the unlikely archaeologist of these quiet sorrows.
