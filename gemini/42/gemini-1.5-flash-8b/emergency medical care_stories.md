The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Amelia "Amy" Carter's face, stinging her cheeks and making her breath cloud in the frigid air.  The flickering sodium lights of the deserted highway cast long, skeletal shadows across the snow-covered landscape, each one seeming to mock the relentless silence.  She huddled deeper into her oversized parka, the heavy scent of pine and something faintly metallic clinging to the crisp air.  This stretch of I-95, usually a blur of rush-hour traffic, was eerily empty, a stark contrast to the frenetic pace she was accustomed to in the bustling emergency room of Mercy Hospital.  Amy, a paramedic with three years under her belt and a relentless passion for saving lives, stared out at the vast, featureless expanse.  Her call-out for the night had been simple, yet chillingly ominous: a report of a "serious accident" on the highway.  Three hours out, and all she'd found were broken branches, scattered debris, and an unnerving quiet.  The metallic scent, now stronger, grew more pronounced.  Where was the wreck? Where were the victims?
