Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Dr. Eleanor Vance's clinic, a relentless drumming that echoed the frantic pace of the day.  The small, unassuming building, nestled between a bakery overflowing with the sweet aroma of cinnamon rolls and a bustling auto repair shop, seemed barely to hold its own against the storm.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and the faint, metallic tang of sweat.  Eleanor, Dr. Eleanor Vance, adjusted her glasses, the lenses reflecting the flickering fluorescent light as she surveyed the room.  A low hum of activity – the rhythmic click of a patient's spine, the murmur of hushed conversations – filled the space, a counterpoint to the furious downpour outside.  Today, however, the usual rhythm was disrupted.  A new, anxious energy pulsed through the clinic, tangible even through the noise.
