The chipped Formica countertop gleamed under the harsh fluorescent lights of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, reflecting the agitated tremor in her hands as she meticulously arranged a stack of manila folders.  Rain hammered against the single, grimy window, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  Outside, the grey November sky mirrored the pervasive gloom that had settled over the city, and, more importantly, over the burgeoning anxiety she felt about her newest client.

Eleanor Vance, a counseling psychologist with ten years of experience navigating the tumultuous waters of the human psyche, was no stranger to despair.  She'd seen the wreckage of broken families, the aftermath of trauma, the crippling weight of unspoken burdens.  But this case felt different.  This case feltâ€¦ terrifyingly personal.

The setting was the quiet, rain-swept streets of Oakhaven, a city clinging to its past glory like a tattered flag.  The once-vibrant downtown now sported a melancholic sheen of neglect.  Abandoned storefronts stood like hollowed-out teeth, and the scent of damp earth clung to the air, a constant reminder of the city's fading breath.  Eleanor, who had lived in Oakhaven her whole life, felt the city's despair echoing within her own heart. The relentless downpour was not merely a meteorological event; it was a tangible manifestation of the oppressive silence surrounding the case, a chilling soundtrack to the mounting tension within her.
