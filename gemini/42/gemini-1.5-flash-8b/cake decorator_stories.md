The chipped porcelain sink, stained a sickly yellow from years of lemon glazes and melted chocolate, reflected Amelia "Amie" Butterfield's face.  The reflection stared back, tired but resolute.  A stray strand of auburn hair, escaping its meticulously braided bun, brushed against her cheek, a tiny rebel in a symphony of buttercream swirls and piped rosettes.  Outside, the midday sun beat down on the tiny bakery, "Sweet Surrender," nestled between a bustling antique shop and a row of terraced houses.  Cobblestones, worn smooth by centuries of footsteps, crunched beneath the soles of Amie's worn leather clogs as she carefully arranged a delicate miniature sugar cottage, painstakingly crafted from marzipan and iced with a delicate dusting of edible gold.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the window, illuminating the intricate floral patterns painstakingly piped onto the tiers of the tiered wedding cake.  Today, the air hummed with the quiet anticipation of a momentous occasion – the wedding of local socialite, Beatrice Devereux, and her charming, albeit somewhat aloof, fiancé, the industrialist, Lord Ashworth.  Amie’s reputation for creating exquisitely detailed cakes was as renowned in the local circles as the whispers of Beatrice's lavish taste were dreaded. This was her masterpiece, her culmination of hours, her definitive triumph.
