The fluorescent lights of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office hummed, a relentless counterpoint to the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of her heart.  Rain lashed against the windowpanes of the small, second-floor office in the crumbling brick building, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  Eleanor, a clinical psychologist with a practiced calm, found herself wrestling with a tempest of her own.  The grey, overcast sky mirrored the grey fog settling in her mind as she stared at the meticulously organized stacks of charts and files that lined the walls.  Each folder, a carefully constructed narrative of someone else's pain, seemed to whisper her own anxieties back to her.  This week, the whispers were particularly insistent.

The setting:  Rain-slicked, post-industrial Oakhaven, a city that seemed to have swallowed its youthful spirit, leaving behind a landscape of decaying grandeur and forgotten promise.  The city center, once vibrant with shops and bustling markets, now held only a collection of dilapidated storefronts and the ghostly remnants of a once-proud community.  The crumbling brick and mortar held echoes of lost dreams and unfulfilled potential.  Eleanor's office, tucked away on a side street, was a testament to the city's slow, agonizing decline.  The air itself seemed to carry the scent of damp earth and the lingering aroma of despair.  A faint, persistent clang echoed from a nearby scrapyard, a constant reminder of the city's relentless transformation.
