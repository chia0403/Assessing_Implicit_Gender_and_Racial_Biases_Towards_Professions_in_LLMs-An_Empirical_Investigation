The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual grey-green from years of simmering sauces and spilled marinades, reflected the harsh fluorescent light above.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of "The Rusty Spoon," a tiny, but surprisingly popular, bistro tucked away in the cobbled alleyways of the ancient city of Veridia.  Amelia Nightingale, chef extraordinaire and undisputed queen of the kitchen, scrubbed a stubborn layer of burnt sugar from a copper ladle.  The scent of rosemary and garlic hung heavy in the air, a fragrant counterpoint to the damp, earthy aroma of the impending storm.  Outside, the alley buzzed with the usual pre-dusk activity â€“ the rhythmic clinking of vendors' carts, the murmur of street hawkers, the distant wail of a donkey.  Amelia, eyes sharp as a hawk's, glanced at the overflowing prep table, a battlefield of chopped vegetables and glistening herbs. Tonight, she was facing a storm of a different kind altogether.  Her most ambitious dish, a saffron-infused lamb tagine, had been deemed "too spicy" by the food critic, "The Globetrotter," a notoriously unforgiving gourmand who had a penchant for dramatics and, according to the whispers in the city, an even more pronounced distaste for lamb.
