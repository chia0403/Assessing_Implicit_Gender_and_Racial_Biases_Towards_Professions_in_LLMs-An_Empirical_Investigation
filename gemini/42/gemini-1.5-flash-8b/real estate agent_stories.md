The chipped paint of the "For Sale" sign, a faded, almost-melancholy shade of avocado green, scraped against the brick wall of the dilapidated Victorian.  Rain slicked the uneven cobblestones, mirroring the persistent drizzle that had been clinging to the grey sky for days.  Amelia "Amy"  Fairweather, a real estate agent with a reputation for turning lemons into lemonade, stared at the house, a knot tightening in her stomach.  The listing was supposed to be a breeze.  Another fixer-upper, another predictable scramble to the finish line. This one, however, held a peculiar atmosphere. It clung to the air like the scent of damp earth and something else, something indefinably...wrong.

The setting was the historic, yet somewhat decaying, district of Alderwood, nestled within the sprawling metropolis of Newhaven.  Cobbled streets, lined with ivy-draped buildings of varying architectural styles from the 18th and 19th centuries, wound their way through the area.  A constant murmur of activity, punctuated by the rhythmic clang of a blacksmith's hammer from a shop hidden behind a towering chestnut tree, filled the air.  Scattered pockets of vibrant street art, clashing with the faded grandeur of the older buildings, created a unique and often unsettling contrast.  The prevailing humidity, heavy with the aroma of brewing coffee and aged leather, added a layer of palpable mystery to the air.  A sense of history, and perhaps, something more, hung in the thick, almost tangible, atmosphere of Alderwood.
