The biting November wind whipped through the alley, rattling the rusted sign above Bartholomew "Barnacle" Butterfield's butcher shop.  "Butterfield's Finest Cuts," it proclaimed, a faded, almost ironic flourish against the grime-caked brick.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of blood, aged spices, and something indefinably metallic – a smell Barnacle, with his twenty years of working this particular cut-throat corner of the city, had learned to tolerate, even appreciate.  The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the butcher block, illuminating the glint of a freshly-carved knife and the glistening pink hue of a side of beef, stark against the shadowed gloom of the shop.  Dust motes, disturbed by the gentle sizzle of the wood-burning stove, danced in the pale light, momentarily obscuring the intricate pattern etched into the worn oak floor.   A single, bare bulb hung precariously above a stack of butcher's cleavers, casting an almost theatrical glow over the tools of Barnacle's trade. Tonight, however, the air held a different, more unsettling hum – a silence pregnant with unspoken anxieties, a palpable feeling of impending doom that clung to the air like the chill of the season.
