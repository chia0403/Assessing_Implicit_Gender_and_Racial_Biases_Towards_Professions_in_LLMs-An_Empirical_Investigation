Dr. Eleanor Vance, a neurosurgeon with eyes the colour of storm clouds and a touch as steady as a mountain stream, stared at the X-ray.  The fractured skull, a jagged spiderweb of bone against the soft, ethereal tones of the film, screamed of trauma, of a violent, unseen force.  The patient, a young woman named Elara, lay unconscious in the sterile white room, her breathing shallow and uneven, a fragile butterfly pinned beneath the weight of her injuries.  Eleanor’s sterile gloves felt uncomfortably thick on her hands, her normally meticulous movements now frantic.  This was different.  This case… it felt… *wrong*.

The operating theatre hummed with a low, almost imperceptible thrum, the rhythmic beep of monitors a constant pulse in the quiet.  The sterile air, heavy with the scent of antiseptic and fear, hung thick in the air.  Sunlight, filtered through the frosted glass of the windows, painted pale stripes across the polished chrome and steel, illuminating the meticulously organized instruments arranged on the stainless steel tray.  Outside, the city thrummed with its own restless energy, a stark contrast to the hushed tension within the operating room.  Eleanor knew that beyond the sterile walls of the hospital, the city held its own brand of violence, a violence that often spilled into her work, leaving scars on her patients, and on her soul.
