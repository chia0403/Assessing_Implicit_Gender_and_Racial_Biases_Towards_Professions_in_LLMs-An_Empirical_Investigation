The chipped porcelain sink, stained a dull, faded rose, reflected the harsh, fluorescent light of "The Clipper's Edge."  Dust motes danced in the lone beam, illuminating the swirling patterns of faded barber's cream on Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's worn countertop.  Barty, a man whose grey hair was stubbornly resistant to the fading grey in his temples, sighed.  Another Tuesday.  Another quiet afternoon in the heart of the sleepy, rain-slicked town of Willow Creek.  The rhythmic *thunk* of the shears echoed through the small shop, a counterpoint to the gentle patter of the rain against the single, drafty window.  Outside, the skeletal branches of the ancient oak tree that dominated the town square seemed to weep with the relentless downpour.  Willow Creek, a town steeped in tradition, where change dripped as slowly as the rain itself, felt as if it held its breath.  Barty, with his weathered hands and eyes that held the secrets of countless trims and whispered confidences, was its silent observer.  The scent of old-fashioned barbershop tonic mingled with the earthy aroma of the impending autumn.  He traced the faded inscription on the faded mirror above his sink: "A trim of the soul, as well as the hair." It was a sentiment Barty took to heart, a sentiment that seemed increasingly important in this quiet, rain-soaked town.
