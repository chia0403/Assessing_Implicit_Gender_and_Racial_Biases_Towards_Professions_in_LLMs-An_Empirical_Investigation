The flickering neon sign of the "Sunrise Diner" cast a sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked streets of Havenwood, a town nestled between the whispering pines and the churning, grey expanse of the Nevermore Mountains.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Dr. Alistair Finch's office, a small, almost hidden building tucked behind the diner, a stark contrast to the bustling, if slightly seedy, atmosphere of the town square.  Inside, Amelia "Em"  Carter, Physician's Assistant at Havenwood General, hunched over a worn wooden desk, a half-eaten granola bar crumbled beside a stack of patient charts.  The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune, punctuated by the rhythmic drip, drip, drip of water from a leaky pipe somewhere in the building.  Em's brow furrowed as she read the latest case file: a 72-year-old farmer, Silas Blackwood, complaining of persistent aches and a disturbing lethargy.  The problem wasn't the symptoms, it was the lack of explanation.  Havenwood, with its tight-knit community and even tighter secrets, felt increasingly like a labyrinth, and Em, a newcomer to the town, found herself more entangled with each passing day.
