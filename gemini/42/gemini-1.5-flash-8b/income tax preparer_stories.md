The fluorescent lights of the "Tax Time Express" hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia Hawthorne's frantic morning.  Paperwork, like a chaotic river, surged around her desk.  Shredded receipts, meticulously organized W-2 forms, and a mountain of tax forms lay scattered across the polished surface, each piece a tiny, silent plea for attention.  Amelia, a 32-year-old tax preparer with perpetually tired eyes and a perpetually stained cardigan, stared into her steaming mug of lukewarm coffee.  Outside, the city of Oakhaven was bustling with the pre-spring thaw, a stark contrast to the suffocating atmosphere inside the small, second-floor office.

Amelia's workspace was a meticulously organized chaos, a testament to her dedication and the sheer volume of her workload.  Small, neatly labeled file folders overflowed with client informationâ€”a personal universe within this impersonal space.  The Tax Time Express, located in a nondescript strip mall on the edge of Oakhaven, was a hive of activity, a microcosm of the annual tax season struggle.  The scent of stale coffee and despair hung heavy in the air, a blend familiar to Amelia and her fellow tax preparers.  Today, though, the scent was more pungent, more desperate.  This was the last day before the deadline, and the line snaked around the corner, stretching toward the faded, pastel-painted storefront.  Amelia knew she wouldn't be leaving before the last straggling client had filed their taxes.
