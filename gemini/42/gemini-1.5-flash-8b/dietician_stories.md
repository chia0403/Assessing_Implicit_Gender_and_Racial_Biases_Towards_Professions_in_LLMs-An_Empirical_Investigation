The chipped porcelain sink, stained a dull, avocado green by decades of lukewarm water and spilled fruit juices, reflected the fluorescent hum of the small, cramped clinic.  Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth, meticulously arranging a kaleidoscope of colourful fruits and vegetables on a pristine white platter, felt a familiar twinge of frustration.  Another patient, another dietary battle.  This one, a young man named Marcus, was stubbornly resistant to the very notion of swapping his beloved greasy pizza for a quinoa salad.

The clinic, tucked away on a quiet side street in the bustling heart of the city, was a testament to practicality over aesthetic appeal.  Sunlight struggled to pierce the grime-coated windows, casting long shadows across the cluttered shelves lined with nutritional guides and colourful pamphlets.  A persistent hum of the outdated air conditioner mingled with the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Eleanor's pen against her notepad, the soundtrack to countless dietary consultations.  The aroma of freshly-squeezed orange juice and the faint, earthy smell of basil from her own small herb garden fought a losing battle with the pungent odour of Marcusâ€™s lingering takeout.  Outside, the city roared with a symphony of car horns and hurried footsteps, a stark contrast to the relative quiet of the small space.
