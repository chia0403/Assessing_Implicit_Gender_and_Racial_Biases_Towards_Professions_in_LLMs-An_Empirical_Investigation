The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains, stinging Elias Thorne's cheeks and tugging at the frayed edges of his worn-out flannel shirt.  Dust devils danced across the cracked asphalt of Interstate 80, swirling the fine particles into a hazy, orange haze that clung to everything.  The year was 1987.  July.  The sun, a relentless, unforgiving eye in the bruised sky, beat down on the landscape, baking the roadside weeds into brittle, almost luminous, shapes.  Elias, a highway maintenance worker for the Wyoming Department of Transportation, squinted at the shimmering mirage on the horizon, a fleeting illusion promising water in a land that hadn't seen a drop in months.  He adjusted the worn leather strap of his tool belt, a comforting weight against the emptiness in his gut.  The rhythmic *clink* of his chain saw, a constant companion in the stark beauty of the Wyoming wilderness, echoed through the oppressive silence.  Today's job was routine, but that wasn't a bad thing.  Routine meant predictable.  Predictable meant safety.  A twisted metal sign, half-buried in the dust, proclaimed, in faded paint, "Welcome to the Heart of Nothing."  Elias didn't need a sign to know that. He lived it.
