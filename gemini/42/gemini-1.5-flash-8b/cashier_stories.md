The fluorescent lights of the "Super Saver Mart" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's life.  It was 2:17 AM, and the store, normally a cacophony of shopping carts and hurried footsteps, was eerily silent.  Amy, clad in her faded teal uniform, felt the chill of the air conditioning more keenly than usual.  The only other soul present was a solitary security guard, Mr. Henderson, hunched over a security monitor in the back room, a figure cloaked in the shadows.  Amy glanced at the digital clock on the wall, the numbers flicking by like the seconds ticking away on her own, often-unfulfilled hopes.  Outside, the city slept, oblivious to the quiet drama unfolding within the heart of the bustling urban landscape, within the four walls of the Super Saver Mart.
