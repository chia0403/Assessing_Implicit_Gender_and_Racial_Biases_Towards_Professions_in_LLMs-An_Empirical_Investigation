Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the "Whispering Pines" motel, a rhythmic tattoo that echoed the frantic pulse in Elara Nightingale's temples.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and pine needles, hung heavy in the small, sparsely furnished room.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom, illuminating a scattering of half-eaten takeout containers and a worn, leather-bound notebook filled with scrawled notes. Elara Nightingale, a freelance journalist chasing whispers of the "Lost Colony" rumour, felt the weight of the unsolved mystery pressing down on her.  She was based in the isolated town of Blackwood, nestled deep in the Cascade Mountains of Oregon.  The town, itself a forgotten footnote in the annals of American history, was the last known point of contact with the vanished group of homesteaders decades ago, whispered to have vanished without a trace. Locals spoke in hushed tones of peculiar sightings, strange lights glimpsed in the dead of night, and disappearances that defied explanation. Each day brought fresh rumour and conjecture, and with each new lead, the search for the truth became entangled with the town's eerie past and its uneasy present.
