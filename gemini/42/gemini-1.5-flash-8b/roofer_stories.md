The biting wind, a relentless razor against Elias Thorne's exposed skin, whipped at the skeletal remains of the Victorian mansion.  Rain, the consistency of icy needles, hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless percussion against the symphony of splintering wood and groaning timbers.  Elias, a roofer with calloused hands and eyes the colour of storm clouds, clung precariously to a precarious beam, his weight a delicate counterpoint to the precarious balance of the entire structure.  He was halfway across the damaged roof of Blackwood Manor, a decaying monument to forgotten grandeur, its once-proud facade now a canvas of peeling paint and skeletal timbers.  Below, the cobbled street, usually bustling with the afternoon market, was shrouded in a thick, grey fog that clung to the ancient stone walls of the town like a shroud.  The year was 1888.
