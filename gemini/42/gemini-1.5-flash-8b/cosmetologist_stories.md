The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine and something faintly metallic, a scent Amelia Blackwood, owner of "Bloom & Fade," usually found comforting.  Today, though, it felt oppressive, mirroring the knot tightening in her stomach.  The salon, a small, sun-drenched space tucked between a bakery and a bustling antique shop on Elm Street, was usually a symphony of clinking shears, whispered secrets, and the soft thrum of conversation.  But this morning, it was eerily silent.

Amelia, a cosmetologist with a cascade of auburn curls and eyes that held the quiet intensity of a stormy sea, surveyed the deserted salon.  Sunlight slanted through the large window, highlighting the dust motes dancing in the air and casting long shadows of the empty chairs.  The chipped ceramic mugs sat still on the reception counter, the half-finished manicures on the work tables a silent testament to the abrupt departure of her clients.  The scent of jasmine was almost sickening now, a stark contrast to the sudden emptiness.
