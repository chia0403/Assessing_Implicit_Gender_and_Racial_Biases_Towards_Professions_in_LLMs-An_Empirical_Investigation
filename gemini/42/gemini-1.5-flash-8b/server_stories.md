The flickering neon sign of the "Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow on Amelia "Milly"  Fitzwilliam's already weary face.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless percussion against the clatter of cutlery and the hushed murmurs of patrons.  The air, thick with the scent of stale coffee and cheap cigarettes, hung heavy in the small, dimly lit diner.  It was a Tuesday night, the kind that stretched into eternity, the kind that whispered of forgotten dreams and half-finished lives. Milly, perched precariously on a stool, watched the last rays of sunlight disappear behind the looming, grey clouds.  The diner, a relic from a bygone era, seemed to hold its breath, waiting for the night to fully descend.
