The humid air hung thick and heavy, a palpable blanket draped over the bustling terminal.  Sweat beaded on Amelia Chen's brow, despite the constant hum of the air conditioning units.  Overhead, the rhythmic thud of baggage carousel conveyors sounded like a relentless drumbeat.  Outside, the relentless glare of the tropical sun beat down on the shimmering tarmac. Amelia, a flight attendant for Celestial Airlines, fought the urge to rub her eyes, the tired ache a familiar companion on her graveyard shift.  The fluorescent lights of the terminal cast a sickly yellow hue across her uniform, a stark contrast to the vibrant colours of the exotic flowers displayed in the nearby kiosk.  Today, Flight 789 to Bali was Amelia's seventh flight in as many days.  Another leg of a journey that stretched far beyond the confines of the terminal.
