Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the dilapidated storefront, mirroring the relentless pounding in Amelia "Ace"  Fitzwilliam's temples.  The scent of stale beer and mildew clung to the air, a familiar perfume of the back alleys of Blackwood, a city choked by industry and shrouded in perpetual twilight.  Ace, a private investigator with eyes the colour of storm clouds and a reputation as sharp as her wit, hunched over a chipped Formica table, nursing a lukewarm coffee and meticulously tracing the faded ink on a crumpled telegram.

The telegram, addressed to "Ace Fitzwilliam, Investigator Extraordinary," detailed a missing personâ€”a young woman named Isolde "Izzy"  Ashworth, last seen at the Blackwood Clockworks, a labyrinthine factory humming with the erratic rhythms of gears and steam.  Ace knew the Clockworks. She'd navigated its maze-like corridors before, seeking out stolen blueprints and lost fortunes.  But this case felt different.  A chilling unease settled in her gut, a feeling as heavy as the lead weight hanging from her belt.  The rain continued its relentless assault, each drop a tiny, insistent drumbeat against the promise of a potentially grim discovery.
