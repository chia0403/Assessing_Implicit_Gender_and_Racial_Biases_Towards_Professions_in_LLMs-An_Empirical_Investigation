The chill of the November air bit at Amelia "Maisie" Cartwright's exposed cheeks, despite the thick wool of her coat.  Grey clouds, bruised and heavy, clung to the sky like a shroud, mirroring the subdued atmosphere of the small town of Havenwood.  Nestled deep in the Appalachian foothills, Havenwood was a place of weathered houses and even wearier souls.  Maisie, a seasoned occupational therapist with a perpetually optimistic outlook, felt a familiar pang of empathy.  This was her tenth year in Havenwood, and the town’s quiet despair, woven into the very fabric of its existence, always seemed to seep into her bones.  Her battered, but beloved, 1998 Subaru Outback, a testament to its own quiet resilience, crunched over the gravel road leading to Havenwood Community Center, a building that felt more like a museum of forgotten dreams than a hub of activity.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of old books and the faint, lingering aroma of burnt sugar—a recurring smell that hinted at the community's often-strained patience with the unpredictable whims of life.  Today, Maisie had a session scheduled with a young woman named Elara, a teenager whose world seemed to have been fractured by a recent accident.
