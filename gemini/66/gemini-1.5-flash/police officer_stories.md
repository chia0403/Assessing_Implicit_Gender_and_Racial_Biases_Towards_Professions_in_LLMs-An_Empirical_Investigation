The salt spray stung Officer Amelia “Mia” Hernandez’s face as she wrestled the battered patrol car onto the slick, rain-lashed road.  Headlights cut through the churning grey of the Atlantic, illuminating only a few yards of the desolate coastal highway that snaked along the cliff edge.  The wind howled a mournful dirge, rattling the windows of the aging Ford Crown Victoria and carrying with it the sharp, metallic tang of sea air mingled with the cloying sweetness of rotting seaweed.  This stretch of Highway 17, south of Seabrook, was infamous – known locally as Widow’s Walk, for the number of accidents, some accidental, others… less so. Tonight, the feeling in Mia’s gut was less "accident," and more "something very, very wrong."
