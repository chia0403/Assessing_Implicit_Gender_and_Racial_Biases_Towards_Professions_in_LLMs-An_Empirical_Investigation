The scent of vanilla and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a perfume as familiar to Seraphina "Sera" Bellweather as her own reflection.  Her salon, "Shear Brilliance," nestled on a cobbled side street in the historic district of Charleston, South Carolina, was a kaleidoscope of pastel hues and antique mirrors.  Sunlight, fractured by the stained-glass window depicting a flamboyant flamingo, dappled the polished mahogany floor.  Outside, the rhythmic clang of the horse-drawn carriage bells provided a gentle counterpoint to the low hum of conversation and the snip-snip-snip of shears.  Today, however, the usual tranquil hum was punctuated by a nervous flutter in Sera's stomach.  This wasn't just another Tuesday at Shear Brilliance; this was the day the renowned actress, Evangeline Dubois, was scheduled for her appointment.
