The chipped Formica tabletop vibrated with the low thrum of a hundred conversations, a cacophony only slightly less overwhelming than the smell of stale beer and frying onions that clung to the air of the Rusty Mug.  Dust motes, illuminated by the flickering neon beer signs, danced in the single shaft of sunlight slicing through the grime-coated window.  Amelia Katherine Jones, or Amy as she preferred (though few patrons ever bothered), navigated the cramped space with the practiced grace of a seasoned tightrope walker.  Her worn-out black sneakers barely made a sound on the sticky floor as she weaved between tables laden with empty glasses and half-eaten plates, a tray laden with lukewarm coffee and a precarious stack of questionable-looking burgers balanced precariously in her hand.  The air hung heavy with the unspoken expectations of a Friday night rush at the Rusty Mug, a place where dreams went to die, slowly and over several cheap pints.
