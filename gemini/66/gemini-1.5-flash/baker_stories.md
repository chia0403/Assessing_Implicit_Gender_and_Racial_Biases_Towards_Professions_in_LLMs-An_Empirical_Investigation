The pre-dawn chill bit at Amelia Hawthorne’s cheeks as she unlocked the bakery doors, the scent of yeasty warmth already battling the crisp October air.  Dust motes danced in the pale light filtering through the grimy panes of the window, illuminating rows of flour-dusted sacks stacked high against the far wall.

Its paint was peeling, its sign slightly askew, and the bell above the door jingled with a mournful, slightly off-key chime. But inside, amongst the scent of baking bread and the low hum of the ancient oven, resided a magic that Amelia guarded fiercely, a magic she baked into every loaf, every croissant, every delicate sugared biscuit.
