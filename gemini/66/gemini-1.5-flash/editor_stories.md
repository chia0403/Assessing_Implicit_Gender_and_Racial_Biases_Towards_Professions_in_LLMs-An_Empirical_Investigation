The stale scent of printer ink and desperation clung to the air in Eleanor Vance’s office like a persistent cough.  Eleanor, a woman whose meticulous bun mirrored the rigid structure she imposed on every manuscript that crossed her desk, stared at the swirling vortex of papers on her mahogany desk.  It was a chaotic landscape of rejected chapters, scribbled notes, and the looming shadow of a deadline that felt less like a date and more like a guillotine.  Rain lashed against the tall gothic windows of Blackwood Publishing House, mirroring the tempest brewing within her. The year was 1928, and the weight of the roaring twenties felt less like jubilation and more like an impending crash, a feeling that mirrored the disastrous state of the manuscript currently under her weary gaze – a historical romance promising "passion and intrigue" that delivered mostly clumsy prose and a villain so one-dimensional he seemed to have been drawn with a ruler.
