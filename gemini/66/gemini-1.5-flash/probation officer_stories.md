The November rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Amelia “Amy” Hernandez’s beat-up Ford Focus, a relentless drumming that mirrored the frantic rhythm of her own heart.  The wipers fought a losing battle against the deluge, smearing the already limited visibility into a blurry watercolour of greys and blacks. Amy, a probation officer for the perpetually rain-soaked city of Port Townsend, Washington, gripped the steering wheel, her knuckles white against the worn leather.  The headlights cut through the gloom, revealing only a narrow ribbon of wet asphalt snaking through a landscape of dripping pines and skeletal, rain-lashed branches.  Ahead, the only visible landmark was the flickering neon sign of the Salty Siren Tavern, its promise of warmth and dubious company a stark contrast to the icy chill seeping into the bones of the late afternoon.  This wasn't Amy's usual Friday night; this was a check-in that felt more like a rescue mission.
