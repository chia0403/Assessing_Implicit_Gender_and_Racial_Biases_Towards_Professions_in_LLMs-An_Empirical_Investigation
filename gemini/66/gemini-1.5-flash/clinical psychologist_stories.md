The chipped paint of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office door flaked like winter skin under the harsh fluorescent lights of the Ashwood Psychiatric Clinic.  Rain lashed against the grime-coated windows, mirroring the tempestuous emotions that usually brewed within her waiting room.  Tonight, however, an unnerving stillness hung in the air, broken only by the rhythmic tick-tock of an ancient grandfather clock that seemed to count down to some unseen, inevitable doom.  Eleanor, perched on the edge of her worn leather armchair, steepled her fingers, her gaze fixed on the flickering gas lamp that cast long, dancing shadows across the faded Persian rug. The scent of old paper and damp wool clung to the air, a familiar, slightly melancholic perfume that was as much a part of Ashwood as the peeling wallpaper and the constant, low hum of the building's aging infrastructure.  The silence, however, felt different tonight; heavier, more pregnant with unspoken anxieties than sheâ€™d ever experienced in her ten years at the clinic.
