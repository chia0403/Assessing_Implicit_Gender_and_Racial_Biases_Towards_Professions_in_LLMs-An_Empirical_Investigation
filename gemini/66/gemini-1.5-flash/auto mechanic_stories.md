The greasy scent of motor oil clung to Amelia “Amy” Hernandez like a second skin, a familiar perfume in the cavernous space of Hernandez Auto Repair.  Fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune above, reflecting off the gleaming chrome of a partially disassembled engine hanging from a hoist.  Tools – wrenches, sockets, screwdrivers of every size and shape – lay scattered across her workbench, a chaotic symphony of steel reflecting Amy's own focused energy. Outside, the relentless Arizona sun beat down on the dusty yard, baking the asphalt until it shimmered like a mirage.  The only sound louder than the hum of the lights was the incessant chirping of cicadas, a soundtrack to the rhythmic clang of Amy's hammer as she meticulously tapped a stubborn bolt loose.  This was her sanctuary, her kingdom, her greasy, glorious escape.
