The biting November wind whipped Amelia Katherine Hayesâ€™s auburn braid across her face as she wrestled with the recalcitrant door of her clinic, "Hayes Chiropractic & Wellness."  The old building, a converted Victorian house on the edge of Willow Creek, groaned under the strain of the gale.  Rain lashed against the tall, arched windows, blurring the already fading twilight into a watercolour smudge of grey and purple.  Inside, the air was thick with the scent of pine needle essential oil and the faint, comforting aroma of liniment, a stark contrast to the tempest raging outside.  Amelia shivered, pulling her heavy wool coat tighter around her as she finally managed to shove the door open, the bell above it jingling a discordant welcome.  The only sound louder than the wind was the rhythmic tick-tock of the antique grandfather clock in the waiting room, a constant reminder of time's relentless march, even as the world outside seemed determined to grind to a halt.
