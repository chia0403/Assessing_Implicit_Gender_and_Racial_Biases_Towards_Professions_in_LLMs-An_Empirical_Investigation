The biting November wind whipped at Elias Thorne's weathered face as he wrestled with a recalcitrant oak branch, its brittle leaves skittering across the manicured lawns of Blackwood Manor.  Elias, a man whose life was as meticulously ordered as the gardens he tended, felt a prickle of unease beneath his thick wool cardigan.  The usually tranquil grounds, stretching like a verdant tapestry across the rolling hills of the Scottish Highlands, held a stillness tonight that felt less peaceful and moreâ€¦ ominous.  A low, guttural growl, carried on the wind, echoed from the shadowed depths of the ancient woodland that bordered the estate, a sound far removed from the usual chirping of crickets or rustling of leaves.  Blackwood Manor itself, a brooding gothic structure silhouetted against the stormy sky, seemed to watch him with its myriad dark windows, its silence as heavy as the impending snow.
