The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face, a familiar kiss from the unforgiving Atlantic.  He braced himself against the relentless wind whipping across the desolate cliffs of Ballynahown, the camera clutched to his chest like a lifeline.  The sky, a bruised purple and angry orange, mirrored the turmoil churning within him.  Below, the churning grey expanse of the ocean was a vast, untamed canvas, swallowing the dying light whole.  Elias, a landscape photographer known for his breathtaking, almost ethereal images of Ireland's wild coast, felt a profound sense of unease tonight, a premonition heavier than the sea mist clinging to the jagged rocks. This wasn't just about capturing the beauty of the storm; tonight, he felt he was chasing something else entirely, something lost and long forgotten, hidden somewhere within the tempestuous heart of the crashing waves.
