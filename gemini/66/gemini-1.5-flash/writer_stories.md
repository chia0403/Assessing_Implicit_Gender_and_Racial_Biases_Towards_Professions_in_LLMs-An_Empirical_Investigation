The chipped mug warmed Amelia Hawthorne's hands, a meager defense against the October chill that seeped through the single-pane windows of her attic studio.  Rain lashed against the slate roof, a relentless rhythm that echoed the chaotic jumble of thoughts swirling in her head.

Outside, the ancient oak tree that clawed at the gables of her Victorian house groaned under the wind's assault, its branches scratching a mournful melody against the glass.  Amelia, a writer whose imagination thrived on solitude, found herself oddly stifled by this particular storm, a storm mirrored in the turbulent waters of her latest novel.
