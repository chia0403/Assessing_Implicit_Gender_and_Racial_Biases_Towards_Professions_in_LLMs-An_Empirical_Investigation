The scent of lavender and aged wool hung heavy in the air, a comforting shroud against the biting November wind that rattled the single pane windows of Elias Thorne's tailor shop.  Elias, his fingers stained a delicate ochre from years spent coaxing life into lifeless cloth, meticulously measured the fall of a charcoal grey tweed across the broad shoulders of a stoic-faced farmer.  The shop itself, nestled on the cobbled lane of Church Street in the perpetually misty village of Oakhaven, was a testament to time.  Dark oak paneling, scarred and worn smooth by generations of hands, lined the walls, overflowing with bolts of fabric in hues as varied and rich as the lives they would eventually clothe.  A single, flickering gas lamp cast long shadows across the room, illuminating dust motes dancing in the amber light.  Outside, the grey sky threatened snow, a stark contrast to the warmth emanating from the crackling fire in the hearth, a welcome counterpoint to the chill that seemed to seep from the very stones of Oakhaven itself.
