The brass nameplate gleamed under the lobby's crystal chandelier:  *Aurelian "Reli" Relihan, Concierge*.  Reli, however, was far from gleaming.  He was hunched over a chipped porcelain teacup, the lukewarm chamomile doing little to soothe the knot of anxiety tightening in his stomach. Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of the exclusive Blackwood Hotel, blurring the city lights into a shimmering, indistinct watercolor.  The opulent lobby, usually a hive of tailored suits and tinkling laughter, was eerily silent save for the rhythmic hiss of the rain and the low hum of the air conditioning.  Tonight, the Blackwood felt less like a haven of luxury and more like a gilded cage, holding secrets Reli wasn't sure he was ready to uncover.  A crumpled note lay beside his teacup, its elegant script a stark contrast to the tremor in his hand as he reread the cryptic message:  *Midnight.  Rooftop Garden.  Ask for the Nightingale.*
