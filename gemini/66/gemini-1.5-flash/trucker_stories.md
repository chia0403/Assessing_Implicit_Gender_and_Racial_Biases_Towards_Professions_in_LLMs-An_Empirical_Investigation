The biting November wind howled a mournful tune across the desolate plains of Nebraska, whipping snow into frenzied spirals that danced in the glare of Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins' headlights.  Bart, a man carved from granite and seasoned by years spent battling the capricious whims of the open road, gripped the wheel of his eighteen-wheeler, a beast of steel named "Betsy," with calloused hands.  The cab, a cramped sanctuary against the elements, was warm but smelled faintly of stale coffee, diesel fumes, and the lingering scent of yesterday's greasy diner burger.  Outside, the endless expanse of flat, snow-covered land stretched to the horizon, a monochromatic canvas punctuated only by the occasional skeletal silhouette of a lone tree.  The only sound besides the wind and the hum of Betsy's engine was the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of tires against the icy asphalt, a metronome marking the relentless passage of time and miles.  Bart's destination: Cheyenne, Wyoming.  His cargo: a load of frozen turkeys, destined for some unsuspecting Thanksgiving feast.  But tonight, the journey felt far longer, the destination far less certain.
