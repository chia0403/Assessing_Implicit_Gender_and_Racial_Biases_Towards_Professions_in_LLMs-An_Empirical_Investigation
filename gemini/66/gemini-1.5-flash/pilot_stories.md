The biting wind whipped at Captain Evelyn "Evie" Reed's face as she wrestled the battered Cessna 182 Skylane into a tighter circle above the churning grey expanse of the Bering Sea.  Below, the jagged teeth of the Aleutian Islands clawed at the churning water, their snow-capped peaks barely visible through the swirling snow.  The air crackled with static, the radio spitting out indecipherable bursts of interference â€“ a familiar soundtrack to her life spent navigating the unforgiving wilderness between Alaska and Russia.  The small plane, christened "The Wandering Albatross" in faded, peeling lettering on its fuselage, groaned under the strain, its wings iced over in a delicate, lethal lace. Evie gripped the controls, her knuckles white against the worn leather, her breath misting in the frigid cockpit.  This wasn't just another flight; this was a lifeline, and the lives of three souls hung precariously in the balance.
