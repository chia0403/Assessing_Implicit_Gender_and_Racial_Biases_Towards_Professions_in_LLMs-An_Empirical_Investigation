The chipped paint of the "Welcome to Northwood High" sign flaked onto the already overflowing dumpster like a premature snowfall.  A biting November wind whipped Amelia Katherine Hayes's auburn hair across her face as she wrestled with a recalcitrant umbrella.  Amelia, or Miss Hayes as her students knew her, sighed, the sound swallowed by the gust.  Northwood High, nestled in the perpetually overcast valley town of Ashwood, Oregon, wasn't exactly postcard-pretty.  It was, however, undeniably *her* postcard-pretty, a chaotic, slightly dilapidated, and utterly endearing testament to the resilience of both the town and its inhabitants.  Tonight, however, the resilience felt a little thinner than usual, a fragile membrane stretched taut over a brewing storm â€“ both literal and metaphorical.  The smell of damp leaves and woodsmoke clung to the air, a melancholic perfume announcing the arrival of another long, dark Ashwood winter.
