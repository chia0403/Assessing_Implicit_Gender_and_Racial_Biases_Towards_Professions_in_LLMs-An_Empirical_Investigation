The wind, a rasping whisper that carried the scent of sagebrush and dust, tugged at the brim of Jedediah Stone's worn Stetson.  He squinted, the setting sun painting the vast expanse of the Arizona Territory in fiery hues of orange and crimson.  Jedediah, a man etched by the sun and shaped by the relentless rhythm of ranch life, stood on the crest of Widow's Peak, his gaze sweeping across the sprawling acreage of the Stone family ranch, a kingdom of parched earth, hardy mesquite, and stubborn cattle that had been in his family for generations.  Below him, the lowing of his Hereford herd mingled with the mournful cry of a hawk circling high above, a soundtrack to the impending twilight. The air grew colder, a stark contrast to the day's oppressive heat, and a shiver, more than just the chill, ran down Jedediah's spine.  Something felt wrong, a discordant note in the familiar symphony of the ranch.  The silence, broken only by the wind's mournful sigh, felt heavier than usual, pregnant with unspoken threat.
