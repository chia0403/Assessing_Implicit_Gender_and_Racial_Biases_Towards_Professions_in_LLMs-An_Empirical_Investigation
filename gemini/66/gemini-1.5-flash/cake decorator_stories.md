The air in the "Sweet Surrender" bakery hung thick with the scent of vanilla bean, browned butter, and a faint, almost imperceptible hint of impending doom.  Dust motes, illuminated by the afternoon sun slanting through the lace-curtained windows, danced in the golden rays.  Twenty-seven-year-old  Isadora "Izzy" Bellweather, her flour-dusted apron a testament to a morning spent wrestling with a particularly recalcitrant batch of buttercream roses, meticulously piped a delicate lattice of spun sugar onto a towering three-tiered wedding cake.  The cake, a masterpiece of ivory fondant and cascading sugared violets, stood before her like a silent, sugary judge.  Izzyâ€™s brow furrowed in concentration; the pressure of the upcoming wedding, and the client's notoriously demanding reputation, weighed heavier than the entire confection.  Outside, the quaint cobblestone streets of  Ashwood, a town steeped in history and gingerbread-house charm, hummed with the lazy rhythm of a summer afternoon, blissfully unaware of the crisis brewing within Sweet Surrender's frosted walls.
