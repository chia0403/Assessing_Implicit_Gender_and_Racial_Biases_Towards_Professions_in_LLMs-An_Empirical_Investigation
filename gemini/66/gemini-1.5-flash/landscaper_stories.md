Amelia, her calloused hands already tucked into the worn leather gloves, surveyed her domain – a riot of unruly hydrangeas, a neglected rose garden threatening to reclaim the meticulously laid stone path, and a suspiciously browning patch of what she suspected was a very expensive, and very unhappy, Japanese maple.  This wasn't just another Tuesday; this was the day she faced the wrath – or at least the passive-aggressive disapproval – of Mrs. Vandergelt, notorious for her impossibly high standards and even higher social standing.
