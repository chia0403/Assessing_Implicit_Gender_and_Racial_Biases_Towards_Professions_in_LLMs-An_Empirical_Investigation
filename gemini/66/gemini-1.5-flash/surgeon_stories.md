The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Eleanor Vance's ankles as she hurried across the deserted hospital forecourt.  Rain, the kind that lashed sideways and stung the face, plastered her dark hair to her scalp.  Above, the gothic architecture of St. Jude's General Hospital loomed, a brooding silhouette against the bruised purple sky.  Its stained-glass windows, usually vibrant splashes of colour, were muted and shadowy under the oppressive weather, mirroring the grim mood that had settled over Eleanor since the early morning call.  The air, thick with the smell of damp stone and antiseptic, held a chilling undercurrent â€“ the metallic tang of blood, faint but unmistakable, carried on the wind from the emergency room doors.  Inside, the fight for life and death continued, oblivious to the tempest raging outside, a tempest mirrored in Eleanor's own weary heart.
