The biting wind howled a mournful dirge across the skeletal remains of the Obsidian Cliffs, whipping snow into frenzied flurries that stung Sergeant Valerius Thorne's exposed cheeks.  He hunched deeper into his threadbare cloak, the rough wool doing little to ward off the penetrating chill that seeped into his bones.  Valerius, a man etched with the harsh lines of countless sleepless nights and frozen patrols, adjusted the grip on his halberd, its polished obsidian head glinting faintly in the gloom.  The only light came from the sputtering torches lining the precarious walkway that clung to the cliff face, their flickering flames casting long, dancing shadows that writhed like specters in the swirling snow.  Below, the chasm yawned, a bottomless black maw promising oblivion to any who dared to fall.  This was his post, the most desolate and dangerous on the entire perimeter of Fort Aethelred, guarding the treacherous passage known as the Widow's Walk.  For three years, Valerius had stood watch, a silent sentinel against whatever horrors lurked beyond the forbidding cliffs. Tonight, however, felt different.  A prickling unease, sharp as shards of ice, crawled beneath his skin.
