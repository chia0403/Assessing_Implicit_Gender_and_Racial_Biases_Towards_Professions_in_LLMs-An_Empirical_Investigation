The chipped paint of the classroom’s windowsill was cool beneath Ms. Eleanor Vance’s fingertips as she stared out at the relentless downpour.  Rain lashed against the panes of the old, brick schoolhouse, blurring the already faded colours of the autumnal landscape.  Oakhaven Elementary, nestled deep in the heart of the whispering woods of Vermont, seemed to sigh under the weight of the storm.  The wind howled a mournful tune through the ancient pines that surrounded the building, their branches thrashing like skeletal arms against the grey, bruised sky.  Inside, the air was thick with the scent of wet wool and the lingering sweetness of overripe apples – a testament to the annual bake sale that had taken place just hours before.  Eleanor sighed, the sound swallowed by the drumming rain.  It was a typical October day in Oakhaven – beautiful, bleak, and brimming with secrets.
