The fluorescent lights of the Meadowbrook Medical Center hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* of Amelia Grace Hawthorne's own heartbeat.  Amelia, a phlebotomist with hands that were surprisingly gentle for someone who spent her days pricking veins,  leaned against the cool, stainless steel counter of the phlebotomy lab, the scent of antiseptic clinging to the air like a persistent ghost.  Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the manicured lawns of the hospital grounds, a stark contrast to the sterile, clinical environment within.  But Amelia barely noticed the outside world.  Her focus was entirely on the overflowing requisition forms stacked haphazardly on the counter â€“ a mountain of blood tests waiting to be drawn, each one a silent plea for answers etched in pale ink.  The pressure mounted, a familiar ache in her shoulders mirroring the growing tension in the waiting room beyond.
