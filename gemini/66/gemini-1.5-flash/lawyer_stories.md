The salt spray stung Amelia Hernandez’s face as the ferry churned through the churning grey waters of Puget Sound.  Rain, a relentless drizzle that had been falling since she’d left Seattle three hours ago, plastered her dark hair to her forehead.  The ferry, the *M/V Salish Princess*, pitched and rolled with the choppy waves, a stark contrast to the manicured lawns and towering evergreens of Bainbridge Island, visible now through the blurry rain-streaked windows. Amelia, a lawyer with a reputation for sharp wit and even sharper elbows at the prestigious Seattle firm of Blackwood & Thorne, usually preferred the controlled climate of her mahogany-paneled office.  But this case, this… this was different.  The air hung heavy with the scent of brine and impending doom, mirroring the knot of anxiety tightening in her stomach. She pulled her collar higher, the damp wool offering little comfort against the chill wind that whipped through the gaps in the ferry's windows. Bainbridge Island, usually a picture of idyllic tranquility, felt menacing today, a fitting backdrop to the grim task that awaited her.
