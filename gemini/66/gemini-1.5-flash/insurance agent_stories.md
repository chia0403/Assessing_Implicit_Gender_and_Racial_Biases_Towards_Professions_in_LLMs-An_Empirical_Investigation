The relentless Florida sun beat down on Amelia Hernandez’s sensible beige sedan, baking the vinyl seats to a temperature that could fry an egg.  Sweat beaded on her forehead, clinging to the wisps of hair that had escaped her meticulously styled bun. Amelia, a woman whose life was as meticulously organized as her overflowing Rolodex, adjusted her crisp white blouse, feeling the damp fabric cling uncomfortably.  She squinted through the glare, her gaze fixed on the ramshackle beachfront property looming ahead – a pastel pink monstrosity with peeling paint and a porch sagging precariously towards the turquoise ocean.  This was her latest assignment:  assessing the flood damage to the beachfront villa of the notoriously eccentric, and possibly bankrupt,  Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield III.  The smell of salt air and something suspiciously like decaying coconuts hung heavy in the humid air, a fitting prelude to what Amelia suspected would be a very long, and very strange, afternoon.
