The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume unique to Serenity's Scissors, a salon tucked away on a cobbled lane in the heart of Prague's Old Town.  Rain, a persistent drizzle that had been falling since dawn, plastered the ancient stones and reflected in the mismatched windowpanes of the buildings that hunched protectively around the little shop.  Inside, however, a warm, amber glow emanated from the antique lamps, chasing away the chill.  Amelia Katarina Novakova, owner and sole stylist of Serenity's Scissors, hummed a melancholic Czech folk song as she expertly snipped a stray curl from a client's perfectly sculpted bob.  The rhythmic snip-snip of her shears provided a counterpoint to the steady drumming of the rain against the glass, a soundtrack to her quiet, yet surprisingly eventful, life.
