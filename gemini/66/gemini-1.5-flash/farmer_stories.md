The wind, a rasping, icy hand, clawed at Elias Thorne’s weathered face as he surveyed his fields.  Frost, a shimmering white shroud, clung to the browning stalks of wheat, a cruel mockery of the golden harvest he’d hoped for.  Elias, his breath puffing out in ragged clouds, shifted his worn leather gloves, the rough hide a familiar comfort against the biting chill.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and the faint, metallic tang of blood – a scent that, unfortunately, had become increasingly familiar in the harsh, unforgiving landscape of the High Moorlands. This wasn't the usual biting winter wind whispering tales of hardship; this was a wind that carried the chilling premonition of something far worse. The distant, snow-capped peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains loomed ominously in the grey dawn, their jagged silhouettes etched against a sky the colour of bruised plums.  His small, isolated farm, nestled precariously between the rising foothills and the treacherous moor, felt more vulnerable than ever before.
