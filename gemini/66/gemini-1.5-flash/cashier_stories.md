The fluorescent lights of "Quick Stop Mart" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Hernandez's otherwise silent existence behind the chipped Formica counter.  Rain lashed against the smeared windows, blurring the already indistinct cityscape into a watercolour smudge of greys and blacks.

Tonight, the usual dreariness was amplified by a gnawing feeling that something – something big – was about to happen. The air, thick with the smell of stale coffee and desperation, crackled with an unseen energy.
