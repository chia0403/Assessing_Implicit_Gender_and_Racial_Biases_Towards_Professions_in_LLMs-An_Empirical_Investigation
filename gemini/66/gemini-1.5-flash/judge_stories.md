The humid Louisiana air hung heavy, thick as cane syrup, clinging to Judge Evangeline Dubois like a second skin.  Cicadas buzzed a relentless, hypnotic rhythm against the backdrop of a sky bruised purple and orange by the setting sun.  Her chambers, perched atop the creaking, cypress-shrouded courthouse in the small town of Bay St. Denis, offered little respite.  The antique fan, a relic from a bygone era, wheezed pathetically, failing to stir the stagnant air.  Evangeline, her crisp white judge's robe slightly rumpled from a long day spent navigating the tangled web of local disputes –  a property line squabble, a custody battle fuelled by bitter resentment, and a particularly thorny case involving a missing chihuahua named Coco – sighed, the sound lost in the oppressive stillness. The scent of magnolias, usually a comfort, tonight felt cloying, almost suffocating, mirroring the weight of the final case file resting on her mahogany desk.  This one was different. This one felt…wrong.
