Her dark hair, usually meticulously pulled back, escaped in unruly tendrils around her face, smudged with flour and the telltale stain of a rogue splash of saffron.  Tonight, more than any other night, the pressure was immense.  It was the annual  Honfleur Seafood Festival's final gala dinner, and Antoinette, despite her years of experience, felt the familiar knot of anxiety tighten in her stomach.
