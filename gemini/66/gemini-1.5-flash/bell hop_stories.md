The brass spittoon gleamed under the flickering gaslight, a stark contrast to the grime clinging to the ornate carpet of the Grand Majestic Hotel.  Rain lashed against the tall, gothic windows, each gust a mournful sigh against the opulent, yet decaying, grandeur of the building.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale cigars, cheap perfume, and a lingering hint of something far less pleasant – something akin to desperation.  This was the atmosphere that twenty-two-year-old Archibald "Archie" Finch, bell hop extraordinaire (or at least, he aspired to be), navigated with the practiced ease of a seasoned sailor navigating a tempest.  His crisp, navy blue uniform, though slightly rumpled from a particularly frantic afternoon, still held a certain jaunty air, a testament to Archie’s inherent optimism, even in the face of the Grand Majestic’s chronic disrepair and its equally chronic clientele.
