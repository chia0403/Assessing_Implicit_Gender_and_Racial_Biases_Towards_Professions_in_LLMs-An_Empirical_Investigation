The biting November wind whipped Amelia Katherine Blackwood's auburn hair across her face as she wrestled the heavy easel into her tiny, frost-kissed studio.  Snow, already a thick layer on the cobblestones of the narrow lane, crunched under her worn boots.  Her studio, perched precariously on the edge of the ancient port of Penzance, Cornwall, offered breathtaking, if somewhat brutal, views of the churning Atlantic. The grey, slate-roofed houses huddled together like gossiping old women, their windows glowing with the warm amber light of hearth fires, a stark contrast to the wild, untamed fury of the sea before her.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of linseed oil and turpentine, a familiar comfort to Amelia, a stark counterpoint to the chilling wind that howled like a banshee outside her storm-lashed sanctuary.  Tonight, however, even the familiar scent couldn't entirely mask the chilling premonition that settled heavy in her chest.  The canvas stood starkly blank, waiting, mocking her with its pristine emptiness.  Something was different tonight. Something was wrong.
