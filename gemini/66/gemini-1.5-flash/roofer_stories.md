The biting November wind whipped at Elias Thorne’s thick woolen scarf, stinging his cheeks a fiery red.  He clung to the steeply pitched slate roof of Mrs. Periwinkle’s Victorian monstrosity, the grey shingles slick beneath his worn work boots.  Below, the town of Oakhaven huddled in the valley, a patchwork quilt of muted autumn colours – browns, oranges, and the lingering green of stubbornly defiant pines.  The air, thin and crisp at this altitude, carried the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth, a familiar perfume to Elias, a scent as ingrained in him as the calluses on his hands.  He adjusted his grip on the slate tile, his gaze sweeping across the breathtaking panorama, momentarily forgetting the precariousness of his perch and the nagging ache in his old shoulder.  Today, however, the view offered little solace.  The job was proving more challenging than anticipated, and the coming storm promised to make it a whole lot worse.
