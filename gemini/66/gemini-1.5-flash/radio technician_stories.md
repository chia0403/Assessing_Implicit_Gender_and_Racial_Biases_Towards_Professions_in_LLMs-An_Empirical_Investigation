The smell of ozone and burnt solder hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Elias Thorne, a scent as comforting as old leather and pipe tobacco.  Elias, hunched over a workbench cluttered with transistors, resistors, and the ghostly glow of a cathode ray tube, meticulously probed a malfunctioning shortwave radio with a slender screwdriver.  Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of his workshop, a rhythmic percussion accompanying the crackle and hiss emanating from the ailing device.  The workshop itself, nestled precariously on the edge of Salt Creek, a forgotten pocket of the sprawling coastal town of Port Blossom, was a testament to Elias's solitary life: a jumble of salvaged parts, half-finished projects, and stacks of dusty manuals, illuminated by a single bare bulb that swung gently from the ceiling.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune, a fitting soundtrack to the storm brewing not just outside, but seemingly within the heart of the old radio itself.
