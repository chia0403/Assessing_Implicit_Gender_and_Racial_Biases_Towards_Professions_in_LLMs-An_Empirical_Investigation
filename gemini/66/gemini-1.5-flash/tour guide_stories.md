The midday sun beat down on Amelia Hernandez's shoulders, turning the already-sticky air of the Louisiana bayou into a thick, shimmering haze.  Cicadas buzzed a relentless, hypnotic drone, punctuated only by the occasional croak of a bullfrog and the distant chug of a swamp tour boat.  Amelia, her straw hat shading her dark eyes, adjusted the microphone clipped to her collar.  The humid air clung to her crisp, khaki uniform, the scent of magnolia and decaying vegetation mingling unpleasantly in her nostrils.  Today's group, a gaggle of wide-eyed tourists from Ohio, were already complaining about the heat, but Amelia, a seasoned veteran of countless bayou expeditions, knew the real show was just beginning.  The air crackled with a palpable, almost supernatural energy, a feeling that always preceded a particularly memorable encounter in the heart of Jean Lafitte's legendary swamp.
