The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of sawdust, blood, and something indefinably metallic – a scent that clung to Archibald "Archie" Fitzwilliam like a second skin after thirty years spent behind the cleaver.  Archie, proprietor of Fitzwilliam's Fine Meats, stood hunched over his workbench, the dim light of the early morning filtering through the grimy windows of his shop on Grimsborough's cobbled Butcher's Row.  Outside, the sleepy town still slumbered, the only sounds the rhythmic creak of his aging wooden chopping block and the distant caw of a lone crow.  But within the confines of his shop, the day was already in full swing, a symphony of slicings, grindings, and the quiet thud of meat hitting the marble counter – a symphony only Archie could truly conduct.  The frost clinging to the windowpanes mirrored the chill that settled in his bones each November, a chill that went deeper than the autumn air.  This year, however, something felt different, a prickle of unease that had nothing to do with the weather.
