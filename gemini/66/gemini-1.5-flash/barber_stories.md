The rusty sign creaked a mournful tune in the October wind, its faded lettering barely legible:  *Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins, Master Barber*.  Dust motes, illuminated by the weak afternoon sun struggling through the grime-coated window of his shop, danced in the air like tiny, weary spirits. Bart Higgins himself, a man whose face resembled a well-worn leather apron – lined, weathered, but still possessing a quiet strength – sat perched on a worn, high-backed barber chair, his gaze fixed on the swirling dust.  The air hung thick with the scent of bay rum, stale coffee, and something faintly metallic, a lingering reminder of the last customer’s unfortunate encounter with a particularly stubborn ingrown hair.  Outside, the wind howled a lonely ballad, mirroring the desolate mood that had settled over the once-thriving town of Havenwood, a place slowly succumbing to the encroaching shadows of a forgotten era.
