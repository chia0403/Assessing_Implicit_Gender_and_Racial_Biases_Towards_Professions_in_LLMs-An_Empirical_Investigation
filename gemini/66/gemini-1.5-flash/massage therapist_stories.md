The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Serenity Now Massage Therapy, a rhythm that echoed the persistent throb in Elara Vanceâ€™s temples.  Elara, a woman whose hands possessed the uncanny ability to melt away tension both physical and emotional, found herself strangely stiff this evening.  The air hung heavy and humid inside the small, converted garage, a stark contrast to the cool, calming atmosphere she usually cultivated.  The scent of lavender and chamomile, typically a soothing balm, tonight only served to highlight the underlying mustiness clinging to the damp plaster walls. Outside, the storm raged, transforming the usually tranquil view of the rolling green hills of the Sonoma Valley into a blurred, grey canvas.  Inside, the only light came from a single, flickering Himalayan salt lamp, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to mock her exhaustion.  Tonight, serenity felt a long way off.
