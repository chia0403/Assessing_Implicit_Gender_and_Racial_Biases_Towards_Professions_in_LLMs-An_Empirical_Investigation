The biting wind whipped at Elias Thorne’s thick woolen coat, stinging his cheeks with icy needles.  He squinted through the swirling snow, the vast, unforgiving expanse of the Cascade Mountains looming before him like a slumbering giant, its peaks shrouded in a swirling grey mist.  Ancient Douglas firs, their branches bowed low under the weight of the fresh snowfall, stretched towards the heavens like supplicating arms. Elias, a man carved from the same granite as the mountains themselves, adjusted the worn leather straps of his axe, the familiar weight a comforting presence in the desolate beauty.  The air hung heavy with the scent of pine and damp earth, a fragrance both bracing and melancholic, a perfect reflection of his own mood this blustery January morning.  He was alone, as he often was, deep within the heart of the Blackwood National Forest, miles from the nearest road and even further from the life he’d left behind.
