The air in Anya Sharma’s cubicle hummed with the low thrum of a thousand quietly working servers.  Anya, a systems analyst for Global Dynamics Corp, usually found the rhythmic drone soothing, a white noise that helped her focus on the intricate web of code she navigated daily.  But today, the hum felt different – a discordant note vibrating beneath the surface, mirroring the unsettling feeling coiling in her gut.  Fluorescent lights flickered intermittently above, casting long, unsteady shadows across the rows of identical desks in the sprawling, windowless data center. The stale, recycled air smelled faintly of ozone and desperation, a scent Anya had come to associate with impending IT disasters.  Outside, the relentless Chicago wind howled, a mournful counterpoint to the increasingly erratic whirring of the cooling fans.  This wasn't just a routine Tuesday; something was deeply wrong.
