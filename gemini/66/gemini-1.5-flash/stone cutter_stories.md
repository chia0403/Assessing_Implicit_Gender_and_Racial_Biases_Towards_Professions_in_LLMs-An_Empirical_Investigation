The wind, a rasping chisel itself, gnawed at Elias Thorne's weathered face as he worked.  Granite dust, fine as powdered bone, clung to his eyelashes, blurring the already fading light of the late afternoon sun.  Elias, his hands gnarled and strong as the very stone he shaped, wielded his hammer with a practiced ease born of decades spent wrestling with the unforgiving rock. He was perched precariously on a scaffolding overlooking the churning grey expanse of the North Sea, the salt spray a constant companion, the rhythmic crash of waves a relentless percussion against the symphony of hammer blows.  The air, thick with the tang of brine and the sharp scent of freshly broken stone, vibrated with the lonely energy of his solitary craft.  He was carving a gargoyle, its grotesque features slowly emerging from the raw block, its stony eyes seeming to watch the endless, turbulent horizon with an ancient, knowing gaze.  The unfinished lighthouse, a skeletal tower of grey granite rising behind him, dwarfed him, a testament to human ambition against the relentless power of the sea.
