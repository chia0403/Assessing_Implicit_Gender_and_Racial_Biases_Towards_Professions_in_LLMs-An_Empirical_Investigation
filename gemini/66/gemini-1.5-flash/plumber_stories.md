The biting November wind howled a mournful tune around the crumbling Victorian facade of 13 Grimalkin Lane, rattling the loose panes of glass in their frames like skeletal fingers.  Rain, thick and relentless, lashed against the brickwork, turning the cobblestones beneath Amelia "Amy" Worthington's worn work boots into a treacherous, glistening slick.  Amy, a plumber whose calloused hands were as familiar with wrenching pipes as they were with soothing the anxieties of frantic homeowners, pulled her grimy, grease-stained overalls tighter against the chill.  The flickering gaslight in her battered van cast long, dancing shadows as she wrestled a heavy toolbox from the back, its contents – a symphony of wrenches, pliers, and pipe cutters – clanging a discordant counterpoint to the storm's fury.  13 Grimalkin Lane.  Even the address felt ominous tonight.
