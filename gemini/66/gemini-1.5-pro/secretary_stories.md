The rhythmic clatter of the typewriter keys was the soundtrack to Amelia Grace Hawthorne's existence.  It punctuated the otherwise sterile silence of the office, a small, windowless room tucked away in the labyrinthine corridors of the Kestrel Corporation building.  Fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on Amelia's neatly arranged desk, where a pristine blotter sat beside a gleaming rotary phone and a stack of perfectly aligned manila folders.  Outside, the relentless Chicago wind howled against the skyscraper's glass skin, a distant, muffled roar that did little to disturb the suffocating stillness within.  It was a Tuesday in November, 1968, and the air was thick with the unspoken anxieties of a nation on the brink of change.  Amelia, however, remained unfazed, her fingers dancing across the keys with practiced ease, each tap a testament to her dedication, her precision, her invisibility.  She was, after all, just a secretary. Or so everyone thought.
