The chipped ceramic toucan, perched precariously on the edge of Amelia “Amy” Reyes’s overflowing desk, seemed to mock her.  Its brightly painted beak pointed directly at the stack of brochures for all-inclusive resorts in the Bahamas, a stark contrast to the grey drizzle lashing against the window of her tiny travel agency, “Wanderlust Unlimited.” Nestled between a dry cleaner and a perpetually empty storefront in the sleepy town of Oakhaven, Oregon, Wanderlust Unlimited was Amy’s pride and joy, though lately it felt more like a gilded cage.
