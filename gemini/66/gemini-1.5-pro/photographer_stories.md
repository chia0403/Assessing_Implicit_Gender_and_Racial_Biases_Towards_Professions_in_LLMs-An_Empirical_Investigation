The sky, a bruised canvas of purple and grey, threatened rain, but Eleanor was more concerned with the sliver of sunlight that, for a fleeting moment, illuminated the isolated Dún Aonghasa, a prehistoric hill fort perched precariously on the cliff edge. This was the shot. This was the image she'd travelled across Ireland for – a lonely sentinel against the raw, untamed beauty of the Atlantic.
