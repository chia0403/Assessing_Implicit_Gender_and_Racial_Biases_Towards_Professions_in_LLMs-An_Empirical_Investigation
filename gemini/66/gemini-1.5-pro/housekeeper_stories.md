The biting November wind whipped around Agnes Periwinkle, stinging her cheeks and tugging at the edges of her starched apron.  Dead leaves, the color of burnt toffee, swirled around her ankles as she trudged up the long, gravel driveway of Eventide Manor.  The gothic mansion loomed against the bruised twilight sky, its many windows gleaming like the eyes of a watchful raven.  Gargoyles perched precariously on the eaves, their stone faces frozen in grotesque sneers. Agnes, clutching her worn carpetbag, offered them a tight-lipped smile.  She wasn't easily intimidated, not after twenty years spent dusting the secrets and scrubbing the sins of the wealthy.  But Eventide Manor, even in the fading light, held an air of unease, a chilling stillness that prickled the hairs on the back of her neck.  This was her new post, and something told her it wouldn't be like any other.
