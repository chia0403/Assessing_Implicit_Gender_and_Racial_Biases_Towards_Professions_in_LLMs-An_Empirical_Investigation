The flickering neon sign of "Clementine's Clips and Cuts" cast a lavender glow across the rain-slicked asphalt of Sycamore Street.  Inside, amidst the buzz of clippers and the scent of hairspray, Clementine Dubois surveyed her domain.  It wasn't much – a cramped space sandwiched between a laundromat and a perpetually closed fortune teller's parlor – but it was hers. Tonight, however, the usual Friday night bustle was absent. Only the rhythmic thump of the bass from the laundromat next door punctuated the silence.  Rain lashed against the large front window, obscuring the streetlights in a hazy blur. Clementine, perched on a swivel stool behind the cash register, idly flipped through a dog-eared copy of "1001 Celebrity Hairstyles," a wistful smile playing on her lips.  She was expecting a late client, a new face in town, and the anticipation was a welcome distraction from the dreary weather and even drearier business.
