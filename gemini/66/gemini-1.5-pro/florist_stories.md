The bell above the door of "Petal & Stem" chimed a melancholic two-note tune, the sound swallowed by the thick, humid air of a Charleston July.  Magnolia blossoms, heavy with their cloying sweetness, drooped outside the shop window, their white petals tinged brown at the edges from the relentless sun.  Inside,  Eleanor Ainsworth Pritchard, her auburn hair pulled back in a loose bun, spritzed the last of the day's unsold hydrangeas with a fine mist of water.  The shop, usually bustling with chatter and the rustle of tissue paper, was silent save for the whir of the ceiling fan and the gentle drip from a leaky faucet in the back room.  Eleanor sighed, a small, almost imperceptible sound lost in the stillness.  This summer, the heat seemed to be wilting everything, including the spirits of Charleston's residents, and with them, her business.
