Rain lashed against the stained-glass windows of Elderwood Manor, each drop a tiny, frantic drumbeat against the otherwise hushed solemnity of the Victorian mansion. Inside, the air smelled faintly of beeswax and something indefinably sad, like the ghost of a forgotten birthday.  Eleanor Vance, OTR/L, adjusted the strap of her oversized bag, the weight of it familiar and comforting.  It held the tools of her trade:  putty, textured blocks, a kaleidoscope, a set of brightly colored stacking cups -  all designed to coax hesitant hands back to life, to bridge the gap between broken bodies and willing minds.  She'd been an occupational therapist for ten years, but Elderwood, with its creaking floors and whispering hallways, still felt like a place where secrets slumbered, waiting to be awakened by the gentle clink of a therapy tool or the rustle of a patient's gown.  Today, Eleanor was here to see Mr. Silas Blackwood, a former clockmaker rumored to have a touch of magic in his nimble fingers, fingers now rendered stiff and unyielding by a recent stroke.
