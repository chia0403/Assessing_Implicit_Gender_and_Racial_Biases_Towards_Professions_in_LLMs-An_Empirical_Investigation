The insistent whine of the high-speed drill vibrated through the floor and up into Amelia Rose Hawthorne’s sensible, beige flats.  It was a Tuesday, the kind of overcast, muggy Tuesday in July that made the air in Oakhaven, Virginia feel thick enough to chew.  Amelia, perched on her stool in exam room 3, polished Mrs. Henderson’s dentures with meticulous care, her mind miles away from the gentle whirring of her own tool.  Outside, beyond the pastel-painted walls of “Smiles by the Lake” dental practice, Lake Shenandoah shimmered under a bruised sky, the surface barely disturbed by the occasional leaping fish.  Oakhaven, nestled between the Blue Ridge Mountains and the lake, was the kind of town where everyone knew your name, your dog’s name, and probably the state of your dental hygiene.  And Amelia, as the town’s only dental hygienist, knew all of it intimately.  Today, however, she wasn’t focused on plaque or gingivitis. Today, she was preoccupied with the antique silver locket she'd found nestled amongst her grandmother’s belongings the previous evening.  A locket containing a miniature portrait of a striking woman Amelia had never seen before, and a single, dried, crimson rose petal.
