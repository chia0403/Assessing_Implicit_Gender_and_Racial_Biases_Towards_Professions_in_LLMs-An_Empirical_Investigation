The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's auburn braid across her face as she hurried down Bleecker Street, the scent of woodsmoke and roasted chestnuts clinging to the air.  Greystone, Vermont, usually felt like a Norman Rockwell painting, all quaint shops and snow-dusted rooftops, but today, a layer of pre-Thanksgiving anxiety hung heavy in the atmosphere. Amy, a registered dietitian with a focus on holistic nutrition, pulled her thick wool coat tighter around herself. Her destination was the Greystone Community Center, a squat, brick building nestled between a bustling bakery and a perpetually empty antique store.  Inside, chaos reigned â€“ or so Amy imagined.  She was due to give a presentation on healthy holiday eating, a topic that usually drew a polite but somewhat disinterested crowd.  This year, however, the town's beloved annual pie-eating contest had been inexplicably canceled, replaced by a "Healthy Harvest Festival," the brainchild of Greystone's eccentric new mayor, a man obsessed with kale smoothies and spirulina.  Amy feared the townsfolk might be sharpening their metaphorical pitchforks.
