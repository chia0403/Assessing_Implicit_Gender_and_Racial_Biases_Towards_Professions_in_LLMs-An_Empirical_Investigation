Rain lashed against the attic windows of Windhaven Cottage, a relentless drumming that mirrored the anxiety churning in Elias Thorne's stomach. The cottage, perched precariously on the Cornish cliffs overlooking the churning Atlantic, had been his sanctuary for the past six months. Elias, a writer whose once prolific pen had run dry, had sought solace in the wild, windswept beauty of the coast, hoping to reignite the creative spark that had inexplicably vanished.  The salt-laced air, however, had done little to clear the fog in his mind, and the blank pages of his latest manuscript seemed to mock him with their emptiness.  The only sounds besides the tempest outside were the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock in the hallway below and the frantic tapping of Elias's own fingers against the worn wooden desk.  A half-empty mug of lukewarm tea sat beside a stack of crumpled papers, testaments to another fruitless writing session.  Tonight, the approaching storm felt less like a meteorological event and more like a reflection of the tempest brewing within him.
