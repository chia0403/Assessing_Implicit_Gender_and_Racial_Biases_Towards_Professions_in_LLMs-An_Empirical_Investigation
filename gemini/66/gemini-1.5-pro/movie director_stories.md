The biting November wind whipped off the East River, carrying the scent of stale bagels and ambition.  Amelia "Milly" Reyes-Rodriguez, her thick black hair escaping its messy bun, hunched deeper into her threadbare coat, ignoring the chill that seeped through its thin fabric.  From her perch on a crumbling concrete stoop in the shadow of the Manhattan Bridge, she had a perfect, unobstructed view of the derelict warehouse that was, for the next six weeks, her entire world.  Spray-painted tags rioted across its brick facade like defiant wildflowers, a stark contrast to the gleaming glass towers that loomed just blocks away. This was not the glamorous Hollywood set Milly had envisioned when she’d signed on to direct her first feature film. This was gritty, raw, and real – just like the script clutched in her numb fingers. "Shadows of the City," a gritty urban drama that was either going to launch her career or bury it six feet under the unforgiving concrete of this forgotten corner of Brooklyn.  The pressure, a constant thrumming beneath her skin, was both exhilarating and terrifying.
