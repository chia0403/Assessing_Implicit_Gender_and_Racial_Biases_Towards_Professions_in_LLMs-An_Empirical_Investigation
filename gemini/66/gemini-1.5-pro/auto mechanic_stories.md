The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of eastern Colorado, rattling the corrugated metal siding of Rosie's Auto Repair. Inside, illuminated by a single bare bulb hanging precariously from the rafters, Cassandra “Cassie” Mae Rodriguez shivered, her breath fogging in the frigid air. Grease stained her calloused hands, clinging stubbornly despite the harsh soap she used.  A half-disassembled 1967 Ford Mustang Fastback, its iconic lines dulled by years of neglect and rust, dominated the center of the concrete floor. Outside, the setting sun painted the endless expanse of prairie a bruised purple, the last vestiges of warmth leeching away into the encroaching night.  Rosie's, named after Cassie's late grandmother, was the only sign of life for miles along the dusty stretch of Highway 40, a beacon of hope, or at least a prayer for a working engine, for weary travelers.  Tonight, however, Cassie hoped no one would come.  The wind howled like a banshee, and a storm, heavy with the promise of snow, was brewing on the horizon.
