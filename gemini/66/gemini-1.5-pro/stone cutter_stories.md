The wind, sharp and cold as a chisel, whipped across the desolate plateau of Aeridor, stinging Elias Thorne's cheeks and rattling the canvas tarp strung precariously over his makeshift workshop.  Grey clouds, heavy with the promise of snow, scudded low across the sky, obscuring the twin peaks of Mount Cinder, normally visible from this vantage point.  Elias, his calloused fingers already numb despite the thick leather gloves, adjusted the goggles perched on his nose and surveyed his latest project: a block of obsidian, volcanic glass the colour of a raven's wing, destined to become the centerpiece fountain for Lord Valerius's winter garden.  The air tasted of iron and snow, and the only sound apart from the wind was the rhythmic *tink, tink* of Eliasâ€™s hammer against chisel, a small counterpoint to the vast, unforgiving landscape.  Aeridor was a land of extremes, where obsidian flowed like rivers of night and the wind carved the very mountains into shapes of mournful grandeur.  It was a harsh place, but it was Elias's home, and the stone, its heart.
