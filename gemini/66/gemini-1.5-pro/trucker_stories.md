The rusty orange sun bled across the endless Wyoming plains, painting the wind-whipped snowdrifts a fiery coral. Icicles, thick as a man's forearm, hung from the eaves of the Last Chance Truck Stop, clinking a mournful tune in the biting wind. Inside, the air was thick with the smell of stale coffee, frying bacon, and the faint, ever-present aroma of diesel.  Eleanor "Ellie" Riggins, her knuckles raw from wrestling with the frozen fuel pump, stamped her feet, trying to coax feeling back into her toes. Her Peterbilt 389, affectionately nicknamed "The Wanderer," sat idling outside, its chrome gleaming faintly in the pre-dawn gloom. Ellie, a woman built like a bantamweight boxer but with the grit of a long-haul veteran, was three days into a cross-country run from California to New York, hauling a load of fragile electronics that needed to arrive before Christmas. This stretch through the heart of winter's icy grip was the most treacherous yet, and a gnawing unease settled in her gut, deeper than the chill that permeated her bones. Something about this desolate stretch of I-80 feltâ€¦ different.
