The rain lashed against the stained-glass windows of The Gilded Lily, blurring the neon glow of the "Open" sign into a hazy halo.  Inside, the air was thick with the scent of stale beer, cheap whiskey, and a faint lingering perfume that suggested jasmine and regret.

The Lily, nestled in the heart of New Orleans' French Quarter, was a haven for the lost, the lonely, and the perpetually thirsty â€“ a role Eleanor, with her world-weary eyes and a dry wit sharper than any broken bottle, played perfectly. Tonight, however, the usual hum of hushed conversations and clinking glasses was replaced by an unsettling quiet, broken only by the incessant drumming of the rain. Eleanor had a feeling it was going to be a long night.
