The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Mia" Rodriguez's dark braid across her face as she trudged through ankle-deep mud towards the pygmy hippo enclosure.  The pungent aroma of damp earth and hippo dung hung heavy in the air, a scent Mia had long ago ceased to notice.  Grey clouds scudded low over the sprawling grounds of the Oakhaven Wildlife Sanctuary, nestled in the heart of the Catskill Mountains.  Here, amidst rolling hills cloaked in browning oak and maple trees, rescued and rehabilitated animals from across the globe found a haven.  Mia, head caretaker of the African mammals section, knew each resident intimately, from the grumpy old rhino named Ferdinand to the mischievous troop of vervet monkeys.  Today, however, her focus was solely on Penelope, the sanctuary's newest arrival â€“ a shy, young pygmy hippo who had been rescued from poachers.  Penelope hadn't eaten much since arriving, and Mia was determined to coax her out with a particularly tempting basket of sweet potatoes and water hyacinths.
