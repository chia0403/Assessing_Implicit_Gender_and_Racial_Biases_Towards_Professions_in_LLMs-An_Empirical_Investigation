The wind, sharp and smelling of impending snow, whipped across the plains of eastern Montana, tugging at the brim of Caleb Jeremiah "Cal" Blackwood's Stetson. The sky, a bruised purple, mirrored the jagged peaks of the Beartooth Mountains looming in the distance.  Cal, perched atop his chestnut mare, Bess, surveyed the expanse of the Blackwood Ranch.  Five thousand acres of rolling grassland, dotted with Hereford cattle, stretched before him, a legacy carved out of grit and generations of Blackwood sweat.  The ranch house, a sturdy two-story structure built from weathered logs, stood nestled in the lee of a small rise, a beacon of warmth and light in the gathering dusk.  Smoke curled invitingly from its chimney, promising the comfort of a hot meal and the crackle of a fire.  But Cal wasn't heading home just yet.  A nagging unease, a prickle on the back of his neck, kept him scanning the horizon, his hand instinctively resting on the worn leather of his saddlebag where his Winchester lay nestled. Something was out of place.  Something felt wrong.
