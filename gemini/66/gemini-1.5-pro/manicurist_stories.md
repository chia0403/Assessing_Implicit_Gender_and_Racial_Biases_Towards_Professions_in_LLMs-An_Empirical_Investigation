The bell above the door of "Nailed It," a tiny salon squeezed between a laundromat and a perpetually-closed bakery, jingled merrily, announcing the arrival of Mrs. Henderson, a woman whose perfectly coiffed silver hair never moved, not even in a hurricane.  Eliza Jane Peterson sighed, pushing a stray strand of her own fiery red hair behind her ear.  It was a sweltering July afternoon in Harmony Creek, Louisiana, the kind of heat that melted asphalt and made even sweet tea taste lukewarm.  The air hung heavy and thick, scented with the mingled aroma of Mrs. Henderson's expensive perfume and the acetone Eliza was using to remove a chipped glitter polish from a previous client's nails.  Harmony Creek, despite its idyllic name, wasn't exactly harmonious, especially when the temperature climbed above ninety.  Tempers frayed, gossip spread like wildfire, and Eliza, despite her best efforts, often found herself caught in the crosshairs.  Today, she was just hoping to make it through Mrs. Henderson's meticulous French manicure without incident, and maybe snag a slice of pecan pie from Miss Edna if the bakery miraculously decided to open.
