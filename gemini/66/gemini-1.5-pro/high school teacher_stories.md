The biting November wind whipped around Ms. Eleanor Vance's ankles as she hurried across the near-deserted parking lot of Northwood High.  Fluorescent lights buzzed from within the squat, brick building, casting a sickly yellow glow against the encroaching twilight.  Pine trees, their needles burdened with early snow, stood sentinel along the perimeter, their dark silhouettes stark against the bruised purple sky. Northwood, nestled in the heart of rural Vermont, was a town where life moved at a slower pace, dictated by the changing seasons and the whims of the unforgiving weather.  Tonight, the weather mirrored Eleanor's mood: raw, restless, and heavy with a sense of impending change. She clutched her worn leather satchel tighter, the weight of ungraded papers and unanswered emails a tangible burden against her side.  The parent-teacher conferences loomed ahead, a series of potentially explosive encounters she wasn't quite prepared for.  Especially the meeting with Mr. and Mrs. Hayes, regarding their son, Jason.  That one, she knew, had the potential to be a blizzard.
