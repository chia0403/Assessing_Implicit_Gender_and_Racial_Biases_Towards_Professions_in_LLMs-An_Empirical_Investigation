The fluorescent lights of Mrs. Eleanor Vance's fourth-grade classroom hummed a monotonous tune, battling the chirping chorus of cicadas outside.  It was the last Friday in August in Harmony Creek, Kentucky, a town small enough that the weekly high school football game was the biggest social event.  The air, thick with the promise of an impending thunderstorm, clung to the faded construction paper sunflowers taped to the windows. Eleanor, perched on the edge of her desk, watched her students pack their crayon-stained backpacks, their chatter buzzing with the anticipation of a three-day weekend.  The scent of pencil shavings and Elmer's glue mingled with the sweet aroma of the honeysuckle vine that climbed the brick wall outside her classroom window.  Harmony Creek Elementary, a single-story building with a playground worn smooth by generations of children, sat nestled amongst rolling hills dotted with tobacco barns and grazing horses.  This year, though, something felt different in the air.  It wasn't just the humidity; it was a subtle shift, a prickling unease that Eleanor couldn't quite place.
