The humid Miami air hung heavy, even at 6:00 am, clinging to Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez like a damp towel.  Pale streaks of sunrise bled across the inky sky, painting the art deco facade of the "Sol y Salud" fitness center in hues of coral and gold.  Amy, clad in vibrant teal leggings and a matching sports bra, adjusted the microphone clipped to her collar, its wire snaking down her back.  Inside, the studio throbbed with the muffled bass of pre-class electronica.  Twenty spin bikes, gleaming under the track lighting, awaited their riders, their pedals poised like metallic moths about to take flight. Amy took a deep breath, the scent of disinfectant mingling with the faint tang of sweat already permeating the air.  This was her sanctuary, her domain.  For the next hour, she was the queen of cardio, the mistress of motivation. And she wouldn't have it any other way.
