The biting Antarctic wind whipped at Dr. Elias Thorne’s parka, stinging his exposed cheeks despite the thick balaclava.  The sky, a bruised purple deepening to black, pressed down on the desolate landscape of the Ross Ice Shelf.

Inside its geodesic dome, scientists huddled, but Elias preferred the stark, unforgiving beauty of the open ice. Tonight, however, the beauty held an unsettling edge.  He’d been tracking anomalous readings from his subglacial acoustic sensors for weeks, a rhythmic pulsing that defied explanation.  It emanated from deep beneath the ice, from a place no human had ever ventured. A place where, according to all known science, nothing should exist.
