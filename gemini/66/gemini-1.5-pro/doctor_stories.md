The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, rattling the frosted panes of Dr. Elias Thorne's surgery window.  Sleet peppered the glass, obscuring the view of the bleak, slate-grey houses huddled along the harbour wall of Port Blossom, a name ironically bestowed on this perpetually windswept fishing village in the north-east of Scotland. Inside, a coal fire struggled against the encroaching chill, casting flickering shadows across the worn, leather-bound medical texts lining the shelves.  Elias, his brow furrowed in concentration, tapped a long, slender finger against a faded patient file. The scent of antiseptic mingled with the faint, lingering aroma of the kippers Mrs. MacIntyre had insisted on gifting him that morning.  It was a Thursday afternoon in late November, a time when the daylight hours were as scarce as smiles in Port Blossom, and a strange unease had settled over Elias like a shroud.
