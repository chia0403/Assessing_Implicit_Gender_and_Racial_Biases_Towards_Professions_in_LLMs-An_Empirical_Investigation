The flickering neon sign of the 'Last Chance Diner' buzzed a dissonant B-flat, a counterpoint to the mournful howl of the wind whipping across the desolate Mojave Desert. Inside, Amelia “Amy” Reyes, her callsign KC7RTG tattooed discreetly on her wrist, hunched over a tangle of wires and vacuum tubes, the warm glow of the chassis illuminating the determined set of her jaw.

The radio, a hulking Collins KWM-2A, sputtered and crackled, a ghost voice whispering through the static, just out of reach. It was a sound that both frustrated and captivated Amy, a puzzle she was determined to solve, even if it meant sacrificing another night's sleep in the shadow of the whispering sands.
