The biting wind whipped across the desolate expanse of the Klondike Plateau, stinging Amelia “Milly” Cartwright’s exposed cheeks despite the layers of thermal gear beneath her parka.  Dawn painted the jagged peaks of the Ogilvie Mountains a bruised purple, casting long, skeletal shadows across the frozen ground. Milly, perched high in the cab of her D11 dozer, exhaled a plume of frosty breath that momentarily obscured her view of the site. Below her, the skeletal beginnings of a new gold mine scarred the pristine white landscape like a crudely drawn tattoo.  The air vibrated with the low rumble of idling machinery – excavators, graders, and haul trucks, their metal hides frosted with rime. This far north, even in late May, winter clung on with a ferocity that tested the limits of both machine and human endurance. Today marked the start of a new push, a desperate gamble to reach the gold-bearing quartz vein before the brief summer thaw turned the whole operation into a quagmire. Milly gripped the controls, the cold metal biting into her gloved hands, a familiar thrill tightening her gut. This was her domain, a world of raw power and unforgiving elements.  And today, she had a mountain to move.
