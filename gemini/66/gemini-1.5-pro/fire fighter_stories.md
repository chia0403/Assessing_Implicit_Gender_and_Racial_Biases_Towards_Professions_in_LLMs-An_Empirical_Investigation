The biting November wind whipped around Elias Vance, stinging his cheeks and tugging at the edges of his yellow turnout coat.  Ice crunched under his boots as he crossed the frozen puddles that dotted the abandoned parking lot of the St. Jude's Textile Mill.  Above him, the mill itself loomed, a five-story brick behemoth, its windows gaping black holes in the deepening twilight. Smoke, thick and acrid, billowed from the top floor, staining the bruised purple sky an oily grey. Elias could feel the heat radiating outwards even from twenty yards away, a palpable wave that promised a long, brutal fight. The radio clipped to his shoulder crackled to life, the dispatcher's voice tight with urgency: "Engine 42, confirm heavy fire on the fifth floor, possible persons trapped inside. Be advised, structure integrity is compromised." Elias gripped the nozzle of his hose, the cold steel a stark contrast to the inferno that awaited him.  Tonight was going to be bad.
