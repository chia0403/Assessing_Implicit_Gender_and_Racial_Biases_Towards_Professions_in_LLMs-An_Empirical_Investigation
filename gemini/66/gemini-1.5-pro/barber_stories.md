The flickering neon sign of "Finnian O'Malley's Tonsorial Parlour" buzzed a tired, lavender hum over the rain-slicked streets of Aethelburg.  The town, nestled deep in the Pennine hills of England, clung to the slopes like a stubborn weed, its stone buildings huddled against the perpetually grey sky.  Inside, amidst the comforting scent of bay rum and talcum powder, Finnian O'Malley himself, a man whose face resembled a kindly, weathered walnut, meticulously stropped his straight razor. The shop, small but impeccably kept, boasted a worn leather barber chair, a chipped enamel sink, and walls lined with sepia-toned photographs of long-forgotten patrons.  Rain lashed against the single window, obscuring the view of the desolate moorland beyond, creating an intimate, almost secretive atmosphere within.  It was a Tuesday, usually a quiet day, but Finnian had a feeling, a prickle at the back of his neck, that today would be different.
