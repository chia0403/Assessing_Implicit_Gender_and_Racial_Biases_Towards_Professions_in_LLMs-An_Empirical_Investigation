The flickering gaslight cast elongated shadows across the cobbled alleyway, clinging to the damp bricks like spectral ivy. A chill wind, sharp with the scent of brine and coal smoke, snaked through the narrow passage, tugging at the hem of Seraphina "Sera" Moreau's emerald green gown.  She clutched her threadbare shawl tighter, its meagre warmth a poor defence against the biting November air of 1888 Whitechapel, London. The music hall where she'd just performed, "The Gilded Lily," spilled a raucous cacophony of laughter and drunken shouts into the night, a stark contrast to the unsettling quiet of the alley behind it. Sera, her voice still hoarse from belting out her signature tune, "The Docksider's Lament," hurried towards the meagre lodgings she shared with her sister, the chipped pearl buttons of her boots echoing on the slick stones. Tonight, the familiar sounds felt ominous, each click a tiny hammer against the silence, amplifying the gnawing sense of unease that had settled deep in her bones.
