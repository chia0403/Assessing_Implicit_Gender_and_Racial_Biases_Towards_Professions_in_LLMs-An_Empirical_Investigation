The biting November wind whipped around Eleanor Vance, plastering stray strands of auburn hair across her chapped lips.  She tugged her threadbare wool coat tighter, the damp fabric offering little solace against the creeping chill that permeated even the thickest layers.  The air, heavy with the brine of the nearby sea and the earthy scent of decaying leaves, swirled around the ramshackle building that housed "The Salty Spoon," Eleanor's struggling seaside restaurant. Perched precariously on a windswept bluff overlooking the churning grey waters of the North Atlantic, The Salty Spoon was more a collection of salvaged driftwood and hopeful dreams than a proper establishment.  Inside, the single, wood-burning stove fought a losing battle against the cold, casting flickering shadows across mismatched tables and chairs scavenged from flea markets and shipwrecks. The only other source of light came from a string of fairy lights, their festive glow a stark contrast to the bleakness outside. Tonight, like most nights, the restaurant was empty.
