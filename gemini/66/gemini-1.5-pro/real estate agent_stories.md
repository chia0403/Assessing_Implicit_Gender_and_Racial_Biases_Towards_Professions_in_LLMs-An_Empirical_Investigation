The salt spray kissed Amelia Grace Hawthorne's face as she wrestled a "For Sale" sign into the unforgiving Cornish earth.  Wind, a constant companion on this rugged stretch of coastline, whipped her auburn braid across her cheek. Below her, the slate-roofed cottages of Portwenn tumbled down the cliffside like a cascade of grey stones towards the churning Atlantic.  The late afternoon sun cast long shadows over the scene, highlighting the vibrant hues of the wildflowers clinging precariously to the cliffs.  This was Amelia's territory, her kingdom â€“ a realm of precarious mortgages and breathtaking views, where the rhythm of life was dictated by the tides and the cries of the gulls.  The sign, finally secured, announced the availability of Tregenna Cottage, a charming but dilapidated property perched on the very edge of the world. Amelia hoped the charm outweighed the dilapidation, especially considering the eye-watering asking price dictated by the location.  This sale was crucial; it was the key to finally proving herself to the cynical old guard of Portwenn's property market.
