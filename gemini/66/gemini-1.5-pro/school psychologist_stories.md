The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Eleanor Vance, plastering stray strands of her auburn hair against her cheeks.  She tugged her wool coat tighter, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filling her nostrils.

This was her first day as the schoolâ€™s new psychologist, and the gnawing unease in her stomach had little to do with the weather.  There was a palpable stillness in the air, a quiet that felt less like peace and more like a held breath.
