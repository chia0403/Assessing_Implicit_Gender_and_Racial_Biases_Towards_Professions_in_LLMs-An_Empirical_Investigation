Amelia "Mia" Rodriguez, her dark hair plastered to her forehead with sweat, gripped the metal railing as the chopper banked sharply over the shimmering expanse of Biscayne Bay.

Mia swallowed hard, the metallic tang of adrenaline coating her tongue. This wasn't just another night shift for the veteran paramedic; this felt different, the urgency clinging to the air like the heavy, salt-laced breeze. The flashing lights of police cruisers and fire engines already marked their destination â€“ a mangled wreck on the MacArthur Causeway, its twisted metal a grim silhouette against the backdrop of the city skyline.
