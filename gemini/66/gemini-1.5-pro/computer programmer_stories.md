Rain lashed against the panoramic window of Elias Thorne's apartment, blurring the already fading neon glow of downtown Seattle.  Inside, the only illumination came from the flickering glow of three monitors, each displaying cascading lines of code. Elias, his dark hair pulled back in a messy bun, hunched over his keyboard, fingers flying across the keys with a practiced ease. Empty takeout containers littered the surface of his antique mahogany desk, a testament to the 72 hours he’d spent wrestling with a particularly stubborn algorithm.  The air in the small, cluttered space was thick with the scent of stale coffee and the faint hum of the powerful computer tower tucked under his desk. Tonight, Elias was determined to crack the code, even if it meant sacrificing sleep, sanity, and any semblance of a social life. He was on the cusp of a breakthrough, a revolutionary piece of software that could change… everything. Or so he hoped.  A sharp crack of thunder punctuated the silence, momentarily pulling his attention away from the screen.  For a fleeting second, a strange symbol flickered in the corner of his monitor, a symbol he didn't recognize, a symbol he hadn’t typed.  Then, just as quickly, it vanished.
