The biting November wind whipped around Beatrice "Bea" Rodriguez as she wrestled a stubborn pipe wrench beneath Mrs. Henderson's ancient claw-foot bathtub.  Dust motes, disturbed by Bea's exertions, danced in the single shaft of sunlight filtering through the grimy bathroom window. The Henderson house, perched precariously on a hill overlooking the fog-choked valley of Port Blossom, Maine, was a testament to Victorian excess and equally Victorian neglect.  Elaborate gingerbread trim sagged like melting icing, and the once-vibrant paint peeled away in strips resembling sunburnt skin. Bea, however, was more concerned with the symphony of gurgles and groans emanating from the plumbing than the house's impending collapse.  The air hung thick with the scent of mildew and something vaguely floral, likely Mrs. Henderson's attempt to mask the pervasive dampness with potpourri.
