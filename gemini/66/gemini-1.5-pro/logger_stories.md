The biting November wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the towering pines, whistling a mournful tune that echoed through the Cascade Mountains.  Frost crunched under the heavy boots of Jedediah "Jed" Blackwood as he surveyed the stand of timber marked for felling.  Dawn hadn't yet broken over the dense forest, painting the eastern sky in bruised purples and deep blues.  The air, crisp and clean, carried the scent of pine resin and damp earth.  Jed's breath plumed out in white puffs, momentarily obscuring the rugged landscape of Mount Hood, its snow-capped peak just visible through the gaps in the trees. This particular section of forest, known as Blackwood's Hollow, had been logged by his family for generations, the silence only broken by the occasional screech of a hawk or the rustle of a deer in the undergrowth.  Today, however, the silence would be shattered.  Today, the chainsaw would sing.
