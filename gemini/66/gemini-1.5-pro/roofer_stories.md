The tar hissed and bubbled under the August sun, the smell thick and acrid in the air. Elias Thorne, his face grimy with sweat and soot, wiped a forearm across his brow, leaving a streak of black against his tanned skin.  He was perched precariously on the steeply pitched roof of the old Victorian on Sycamore Street, the shingles hot enough to fry an egg.  The town of Havenwood sprawled beneath him, a patchwork of red brick and green lawns, drowsy under the afternoon heat.  A shimmering haze hung over the distant mountains, promising a thunderstorm later in the day, but for now, the only sound was the rhythmic tapping of Elias's hammer and the occasional shriek of a blue jay from a nearby oak. The copper weathervane atop the Victorian, shaped like a galleon in full sail, creaked faintly in the barely-there breeze, a silent witness to the generations that had lived and died beneath its watchful gaze. This house, like so many others in Havenwood, held secrets, Elias knew.  He'd seen enough from his vantage point over the years to understand that even the most picturesque town had its hidden corners, its whispered stories.  And today, he suspected, he was about to stumble upon one of them.
