The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of North Dakota, rattling the windows of the abandoned farmhouse. Inside, Amelia “Amy” Reyes, a licensed electrician with calloused hands and a spirit tougher than any copper wire, squinted at the tangled mess of wiring spilling out of a cracked junction box. The air hung thick with the scent of dust and decay, illuminated by the flickering beam of her headlamp. This was her third call-out this week to the desolate, wind-swept property known locally as the "Whispering Acres," and each time, the electrical problems were more bizarre than the last.  The owner, a reclusive old woman rumored to communicate with spirits, claimed the house was “fighting back” against modernization. Amy, a pragmatist through and through, suspected faulty grounding and a serious rodent infestation, but a prickle of unease ran down her spine nonetheless. The shadows seemed deeper here, the silence more profound, punctuated only by the mournful howl of the wind and the occasional snap and crackle from the troubled electrical system itself.  This wasn't just a wiring job; it was a puzzle, and Amy, despite her skepticism, was determined to solve it.
