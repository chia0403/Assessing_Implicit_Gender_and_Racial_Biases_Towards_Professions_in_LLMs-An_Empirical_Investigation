The rain lashed against the arched windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  Her mahogany desk, usually a testament to order and control, was littered with crime scene photos â€“ stark images of a body splayed across the checkered tile of a vintage diner, the neon sign outside casting an eerie, otherworldly glow.  Ashford, Washington, a town typically more concerned with the annual apple blossom festival than violent crime, was suddenly grappling with its second ritualistic murder in as many months.  The victims, seemingly unconnected, shared one disturbing detail: a single playing card, the Queen of Spades, tucked into the folds of their clothing.  Eleanor, the county's only forensic psychologist, pushed a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear, the weight of the town's fear a palpable presence in the room.  The ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner seemed to amplify the silence between the staccato bursts of rain, each tick a reminder of the dwindling time she had to unravel the killer's twisted game.
