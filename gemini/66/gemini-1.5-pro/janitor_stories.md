The flickering fluorescent lights of the St. Augustine's Preparatory School gymnasium buzzed like trapped insects, their pale glow barely reaching the shadowed corners where dust bunnies gathered like clandestine congregations.  Elias Finch, the school's overnight janitor, pushed his mop bucket across the polished wooden floor, the squeaking wheels a lonely counterpoint to the buzzing lights.  It was a little past 2:00 AM, the quietest hour in the cavernous building, a time when even the ghosts of rowdy basketball games and screeching pep rallies seemed to slumber. Outside, a late autumn wind rattled the windows, whispering promises of the first snowfall of the year. Elias, a man as worn and familiar as the school itself, sighed, the sound echoing faintly in the emptiness. Tonight, however, something felt different.  The air, usually thick with the scent of floor wax and stale sweat, held a faint metallic tang, and the silence, usually a comforting blanket, seemed to thrum with an unseen energy.
