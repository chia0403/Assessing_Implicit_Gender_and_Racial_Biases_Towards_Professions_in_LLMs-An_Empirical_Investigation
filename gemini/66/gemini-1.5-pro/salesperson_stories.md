The stale, recirculated air of the All-American Motors dealership hummed around Beatrice "Bea" Goldblum like a swarm of indifferent bees. Fluorescent lights, harsh even on this overcast Tuesday morning, glinted off the polished hoods of the new Wranglers lined up like prize cattle. Outside, the endless sprawl of Phoenix, Arizona, shimmered in the heat haze, the distant mountains looking like watercolor smudges against the pale sky. Bea, in her crisp navy suit and sensible heels, adjusted her nametag and took a deep breath, the faint scent of rubber and desperation clinging to the air. This was her territory. This was her jungle.  And today, she was hunting.
