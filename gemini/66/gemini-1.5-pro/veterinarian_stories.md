The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne as he wrestled the heavy oak door of the Cedarwood Veterinary Clinic closed.  Snow, fine and sharp as powdered glass, stung his face. He shivered, pulling his thick tweed coat tighter, the scent of woodsmoke and pine needles clinging to its fibers. Cedarwood, nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains in western North Carolina, was a town that wore its seasons like badges of honor. Autumn, with its fiery tapestry of color, had given way to the stark, hushed beauty of early winter, and Elias, despite the chill, felt a familiar sense of peace settle over him as he turned the key in the lock. Inside, the clinic was warm and dimly lit, the only sounds the gentle hum of the heating vents and the soft clinking of metal from Daisy, his elderly Jack Russell terrier, rummaging in her food bowl in the corner. The air smelled faintly of disinfectant and dog biscuits, a comforting aroma Elias had come to associate with home.
