The biting wind whipped around Amelia "Amy" Reyes as she surveyed the desolate, frost-covered soccer field.  November in northern Michigan was notoriously brutal, and even the hearty pines surrounding the Elk Rapids High School stadium seemed to shiver in the pre-dawn gloom.  Amy, bundled in a thick parka and a beanie pulled low over her ears, stamped her feet, trying to ward off the creeping chill that threatened to seep into her bones.  The floodlights cast long, skeletal shadows across the empty bleachers, painting the scene in an eerie, almost otherworldly light.  This was Amy's sanctuary, her battlefield, and today, it felt more like the latter.  Elk Rapids hadn't won a regional title in twenty years, and this year, with a team of raw talent and fragile egos, the pressure was on Amy to break the curse.  The first playoff game was just a week away, and if the girls didn't start showing some grit, their season, and possibly Amy's career at Elk Rapids, would end before the first snowflakes fell.
