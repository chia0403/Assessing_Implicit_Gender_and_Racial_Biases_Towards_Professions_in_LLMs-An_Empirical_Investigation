The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face as he wrestled his easel against the blustering Cornish wind.  Perched precariously on a granite outcrop overlooking Porthleven harbour, he cursed the unpredictable weather that was as much a defining feature of this rugged coastline as the turquoise water crashing against the ancient stone piers.  October in Cornwall was a wild symphony of greys and blues, the sky a bruised canvas reflecting the turbulent mood of the Celtic Sea.  Elias, however, was determined to capture the ephemeral beauty of this fleeting moment, the way the sunlight, breaking momentarily through the storm clouds, illuminated the white crests of the waves like fleeting brushstrokes of pure brilliance.  His fingers, numb with cold despite his thick wool gloves, fumbled with the paint tubes, searching for the precise shade of cerulean to match the restless sea.  This particular view, the way the huddled cottages clung to the hillside as if bracing against the inevitable onslaught of the Atlantic, had haunted him for weeks. He needed to get it down, to translate the raw energy of this place onto his canvas, before the light shifted and the magic vanished.
