The biting November wind whipped around Eleanor Vance, plastering stray strands of her auburn hair across her face as she wrestled a bulky sample book out of her vintage Porsche.  The slate-grey sky threatened snow, and the gothic spires of Blackwood Manor loomed against it like skeletal fingers.  Nestled deep within the sprawling, fog-shrouded moors of Yorkshire, England, the manor exuded an eerie stillness, a silence broken only by the rustling of dead leaves in the overgrown gardens. Eleanor, however, was undeterred. This was her biggest commission yet: to breathe life back into the long-abandoned ancestral home of the notoriously reclusive Cavendish family.  And while the local villagers whispered tales of restless spirits and shadowed secrets within the manorâ€™s walls, Eleanor saw only potential. The cracked frescoes, the faded tapestries, the dusty chandeliers - they were all a blank canvas just waiting for her artistic touch.  This wasn't just a job; it was a resurrection.
