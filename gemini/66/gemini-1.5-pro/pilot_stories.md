The biting wind whipped at Amelia "Mia" Reyes's flight jacket as she prepped the Cessna 172 Skyhawk for takeoff. The small airfield in Talkeetna, Alaska, was dusted with a fresh layer of snow, the surrounding Chugach Mountains looming like slumbering giants, their peaks shrouded in a veil of icy fog. The air crackled with the static of the approaching winter storm, and the small propeller plane rocked gently in the gusts. Mia double-checked the fuel gauge, the pre-flight checklist fluttering in her gloved hand.  This wasn't a pleasure trip; a thick envelope marked "URGENT" rested on the passenger seat, its contents detailing a desperate plea from a remote village nestled deep within the unforgiving Alaskan wilderness.  The sun, a weak, watery orb, barely peeked over the horizon, casting long, skeletal shadows across the snow-covered runway. Mia took a deep breath, the frigid air stinging her lungs. This was the kind of flight she lived for â€“ dangerous, unpredictable, and vital.  The future, like the swirling snow, felt uncertain, but one thing was clear: Mia Reyes was about to face it head-on.
