The biting wind whipped across the desolate stretch of Highway 17, carrying with it the scent of pine needles and the faint, metallic tang of approaching snow.  Jasper Hale "Jax" Blackwood, his face chapped raw beneath his fluorescent orange beanie, hunched deeper into his thick parka.  The late November sun, a pale and watery disc in the iron-grey sky, offered little warmth against the encroaching cold.  Around him, the skeletal branches of lodgepole pines clawed at the sky, their silhouettes stark against the vast, snow-dusted expanse of the Bitterroot Mountains in western Montana. Jax stamped his feet against the frozen ground, a futile attempt to ward off the chill that seeped into his heavy work boots.  The flashing arrow sign on the back of his orange pickup truck blinked rhythmically, a lonely beacon against the gathering gloom.  He was miles from anything resembling civilization, tasked with clearing a recent rockslide that had tumbled down from the cliffs above, blocking the only road in or out of the small, isolated town of Granite Creek.
