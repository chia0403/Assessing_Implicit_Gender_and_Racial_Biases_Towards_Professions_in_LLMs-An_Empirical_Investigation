The insistent chirping of a robin outside the window did little to brighten Amelia Rose Hawthorne's mood.  Grey light, the weak sort that hinted at a reluctant dawn, filtered through the blinds of her small apartment, casting long shadows across the mismatched furniture.  Rain hammered against the windowpane, a relentless rhythm that mirrored the dull ache in her temples.  Another Tuesday. Another day in the brightly coloured chaos of Room 3B at Sunny Meadow Elementary, where glitter was a condiment and finger paint an essential food group.  Amelia sighed, pushing aside a stack of graded colouring pages depicting wildly imaginative interpretations of “My Family.”  She knew she should be filled with her usual pre-school enthusiasm, the kind that involved jazz hands and spontaneous renditions of “The Wheels on the Bus,” but today, the bus felt firmly stuck in the mud.  Even the aroma of freshly brewed coffee, usually a reliable mood booster, failed to ignite her usual spark. Something felt…off.
