Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's chiropractic clinic, a rhythmic drumming that mirrored the throbbing ache in his own lower back.  The "Thorne Chiropractic & Wellness Center," its optimistic green sign barely visible through the downpour, stood solitary on the edge of Hollow Creek, Oregon, a town more known for its perpetually overcast skies and struggling lumber mills than its thriving healthcare scene.  Inside, the waiting room, usually bustling with patients clutching stiff necks and complaining of slipped discs, was empty save for Agnes, Elias's perpetually cheerful receptionist, who was meticulously alphabetizing a stack of patient files while humming along to a mournful country ballad on the radio.  The scent of pine-scented cleaning spray mingled with the faint, metallic tang of impending ozone.  Elias, a man of forty with kind eyes, a neatly trimmed salt-and-pepper beard, and hands that could coax a misaligned vertebra back into place with surprising gentleness, sighed, rubbing his aching back.  Another long, slow Tuesday in Hollow Creek. He just had a feeling this one was about to get a whole lot more interesting.
