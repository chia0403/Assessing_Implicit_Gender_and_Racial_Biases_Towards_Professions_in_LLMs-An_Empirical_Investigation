The biting wind whipped down Cobblestone Alley, carrying the scent of brine from the nearby docks and the metallic tang of blood from Elias Thorne's butcher shop.  It was a Thursday, the slowest day of the week in Port Blossom, Maine, and the sky, the color of a bruised plum, threatened snow.  Inside, Elias, his thick apron stained crimson, sharpened his cleaver with a rhythmic rasp against the steel.  The shop, "Thorne's Fine Cuts," was small but meticulously clean, the sawdust-covered floor spotless despite the nature of the trade.  Rows of gleaming hooks hung empty, awaiting the arrival of tomorrow's delivery, save for a single, magnificent leg of lamb hanging like a fleshy chandelier in the center of the room.  A single flickering gas lamp cast long, dancing shadows across the walls, illuminating the framed certificates proclaiming Elias's numerous awards for his sausage-making prowess. The quiet was broken only by the scrape of the sharpening steel and the mournful howl of the wind, a lonely sound in the dying light.
