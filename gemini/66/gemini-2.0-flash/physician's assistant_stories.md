**Setting:** The waiting room of Coastal Family Medicine in Seabreeze, North Carolina. Sunlight streams through the large, plate-glass window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. The walls are painted a soothing, pale blue, adorned with framed prints of local landscapes: the towering Bodie Island Lighthouse, a vibrant sunset over the Pamlico Sound, and a flock of pelicans taking flight above the shore. The air is thick with the scent of antiseptic, mingled with a subtle hint of saltwater carried in on the gentle sea breeze. A low hum of conversation fills the room, punctuated by the rhythmic beeping of the blood pressure monitor and the occasional cough. A television mounted in the corner silently displays a news channel, its volume muted. Copies of "Coastal Living" and "Southern Living" magazines are neatly stacked on a small table beside a worn, upholstered armchair.

**Opening:**

The screech of the front door hinges announced old Mrs. Periwinkle's arrival, cutting through the low hum of the waiting room. Eleanor Anne Ainsworth, Physicianâ€™s Assistant, barely glanced up from the chart she was reviewing, already anticipating the woman's familiar complaints about her bunions and the relentless North Carolina humidity. She finished scribbling a note in the margin about a patient's slightly elevated blood pressure, then sighed, pushing her reading glasses up the bridge of her nose. The morning had been relentlessly busy, a whirlwind of sniffles, aches, and sunburnt tourists. It was only 9:15, and Eleanor already felt the familiar tug of exhaustion settling in her shoulders. She braced herself for another round of medical minutiae, hoping Mrs. Periwinkle had at least brought her famous lemon squares this time.
