## Story Opening:

Rain, the kind that sneaks in under collars and chills bone-deep, hammered against the plate glass window of Jasper Blackwood's office, blurring the neon glow of "EATS" across the street. He hated nights like this, nights where the city coughed up its secrets in the form of desperate souls seeking solace, or worse, burying their sins deeper. Tonight, it looked like the latter. The flickering fluorescent light above his head cast harsh shadows across the cluttered desk, where a half-empty bottle of rye whiskey sat like a silent judge. He took another swig, the burn a welcome distraction from the gnawing feeling in his gut. Some cases just reeked of trouble, even before the client walked through the door. And this one? This one smelled like a freshly dug grave.

A knock, tentative and hesitant, echoed through the small office. Jasper sighed, running a hand through his already disheveled hair. He needed another drink, but duty – and the promise of a payday – called. "Come in," he rasped, his voice rough from disuse and cheap liquor. The door creaked open, revealing a woman shrouded in a voluminous, dark coat. As she stepped inside, the scent of lilies and fear filled the room, a morbid cocktail that tightened the knot in Jasper's gut just a little bit more.

## Setting:

The office of Jasper Blackwood, Private Investigations, occupied a cramped space on the third floor of a pre-war building on Elm Street, in the heart of the dilapidated downtown district of New Haven, Connecticut. The building itself was a testament to a bygone era, a once-grand structure now scarred by neglect and the relentless march of time. The peeling wallpaper inside Jasper's office was a faded floral pattern, stained yellow from years of cigarette smoke. The furniture consisted of a mismatched collection of thrift store finds: a chipped mahogany desk piled high with case files, unpaid bills, and empty coffee cups; a creaky leather armchair with a suspiciously dark stain on the cushion; and a couple of hard-backed chairs for clients, positioned to maximize discomfort and encourage brevity. A single window, overlooking the grimy street below, was perpetually grimy and offered a depressing view of a liquor store and a pawn shop. The air hung thick with the mingled scents of stale coffee, dust, and the faint, lingering aroma of tobacco. It was a place of secrets, whispers, and the faint hope that maybe, just maybe, justice could be found in the unlikeliest of corners.
