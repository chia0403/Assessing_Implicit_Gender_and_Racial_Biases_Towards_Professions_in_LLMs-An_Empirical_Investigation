The sun, a molten copper coin in the sky, bled its light across the newly tilled fields of Oakhaven Farm. Dust motes danced in the air, kicked up by the slow, rhythmic turning of the earth as Archibald Theodore Pemberton steered his ancient Massey Ferguson tractor along the furrow. He wasn't a young man anymore, Archibald, his skin tanned and weathered like old saddle leather, crisscrossed with lines etched by decades of sun, wind, and worry. Each wrinkle told a silent story: of bountiful harvests, heartbreaking droughts, and the ever-present struggle to coax life from the stubborn soil.

Oakhaven Farm wasn't much, just a hundred and twenty acres nestled in the rolling hills of Havenwood County, Iowa. The farmhouse, a two-story Victorian with peeling paint and a porch that sagged like a tired smile, stood a respectful distance from the fields, overlooking the patchwork of corn and soybeans. A rusted windmill creaked incessantly in the breeze, its rhythmic groan a constant companion. Beyond the fields, a thick band of oak trees formed a dark green border, whispering secrets in the rustling leaves. This was Archibald's kingdom, his legacy, his life. He poured his sweat, his tears, and every spare penny he had into this land. And lately, the land was proving a harsh mistress.
