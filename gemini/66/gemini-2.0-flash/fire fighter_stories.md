## Story Opening:

The acrid, metallic tang of smoke hung thick in the night air, clinging to everything like a desperate lover. Sergeant Alistair James Finch spat onto the cracked asphalt, the taste bitter on his tongue. The roar of the flames, like a hungry beast, vibrated through his boots and up his spine. He could feel the heat even through his Nomex gear, a relentless, insidious force pushing back against the icy grip of the November wind. His ears rang with the frantic shouts of his team, their faces illuminated in the flickering, orange glow. But above it all, he heard the screams. Thin, terrified cries, swallowed by the inferno, but undeniable.

Alistair yanked off his helmet, wiped the soot from his brow with a gloved hand, and took a deep, ragged breath. "Who's got eyes on Sector Four?!" he bellowed, his voice raw. "We've got potential occupants trapped!"

No one answered immediately. Sector Four was a death trap, engulfed in a swirling vortex of flame. Even seasoned firefighters hesitated. But Alistair Finch didn't have the luxury of hesitation. Not tonight. Not if those screams were real.

He tightened his grip on his axe, its familiar weight a comforting presence in the chaos. "Alright," he muttered to himself, more a prayer than a command. "Let's go to work."

## Setting:

The story takes place in the gritty, industrial district of **Oldtown, a forgotten corner of Providence, Rhode Island**. Oldtown is a labyrinth of dilapidated warehouses, crumbling factories, and vacant lots, remnants of a bygone era when Providence was a bustling port city. Now, it's a neglected zone, riddled with poverty, crime, and a general sense of decay. The buildings, many of them abandoned for years, are a fire hazard waiting to happen.

The specific location of the story's opening is the **burned-out husk of the "Rhode Island Textile Mill"**, a sprawling complex of brick and steel that had been abandoned for decades. Its windows are boarded up, graffiti covers its walls, and its rusting skeleton stands as a monument to lost industry and broken dreams. The fire has consumed a significant portion of the mill, turning the night sky a sickly orange and casting long, dancing shadows that seem to hold secrets best left undisturbed. The air is thick with the smell of burning cotton, oil, and something vaguely chemical, creating a toxic cocktail that stings the eyes and chokes the lungs. The street is littered with debris – broken glass, twisted metal, and the remnants of a life swallowed by the flames. It’s a scene of utter devastation, and Alistair Finch knows, as he stares into the inferno, that it's only going to get worse.
