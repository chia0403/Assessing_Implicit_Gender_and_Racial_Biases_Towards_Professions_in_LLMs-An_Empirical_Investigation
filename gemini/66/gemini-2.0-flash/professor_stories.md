## Story Opening:

Professor Eleanor Vance traced the condensation rings left by her forgotten tea across the chipped Formica tabletop. Outside, the November rain hammered against the leaded glass windows of her office in Cavendish Hall, blurring the already indistinct shapes of the Gothic spires across the quad. The clock on the wall ticked with a malevolent precision, each second chipping away at the dwindling afternoon light and Eleanor's rapidly evaporating patience. Three missed calls from the Dean. A pile of un-graded essays threatening to topple from her desk like a paper avalanche. And, worst of all, a lingering unease that had been prickling at the back of her neck all day, a feeling like being watched by something unseen.

She pushed back her chair, the metal legs screeching against the linoleum, and stood up. "Nonsense, Eleanor," she muttered, more to reassure herself than any unseen presence. "Just a long day, a bad case of pre-tenure jitters, and too much caffeine."

But even as she said the words, a gust of wind rattled the windowpane, and a shiver ran down her spine. The air in the small office felt suddenly colder, heavier. And from the shadows in the corner, she thought, just for a fleeting, heart-stopping moment, she saw the faintest glimmer of something… other.

## Setting:

Cavendish Hall, part of the prestigious, ivy-draped Northwood University, nestled in the quaint, historic town of Ashwood, Massachusetts. The building itself is a sprawling, Gothic Revival structure, built in the late 19th century. Its labyrinthine corridors are dimly lit, echoing with the whispers of generations of students and professors. The library boasts towering bookshelves filled with ancient tomes, and the stained-glass windows cast ethereal patterns of light across the worn wooden floors. The air is thick with the scent of old paper, beeswax polish, and a hint of something else… something subtly unsettling. Ashwood, with its cobblestone streets and quaint antique shops, projects an image of charming New England serenity, but beneath the surface, whispers of strange occurrences and forgotten histories linger like a persistent fog.
