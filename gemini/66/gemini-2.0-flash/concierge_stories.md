## The Story Opening:

The rhythmic clatter of rain against the arched glass ceiling of the Grand Azure lobby was just barely audible over the hushed symphony of hushed conversations and the clink of crystal glasses. Bartholomew Finch, his perfectly coiffed silver hair gleaming under the soft light of the chandelier, adjusted the lapel of his impeccably tailored, navy blue concierge jacket. He’d smoothed it, adjusted it, and likely obsessed over it a dozen times since starting his shift at seven this morning. This wasn’t mere vanity, though; it was a dedication to the theatre of elegance that the Grand Azure demanded.

He watched, with his characteristic discerning gaze, as a frazzled young woman, laden down with suitcases that looked suspiciously larger than herself, stumbled through the revolving doors. Bartholomew could smell the desperation clinging to her, like a faint perfume. This was his cue. He straightened, his practiced smile, the one he’d honed over twenty years of discerning clientele, snapping into place. "Welcome to the Grand Azure, madam. May I be of assistance?"

## The Setting:

The **Grand Azure Hotel** is a landmark of Art Deco architecture, situated on the prestigious **Promenade des Anglais in Nice, France**. Built in the 1920s, it boasts sweeping views of the Mediterranean Sea, visible from almost every window. The interior is a study in opulent restraint: polished marble floors, ornate plasterwork, and gleaming brass accents are offset by plush velvet seating in muted blues and golds. The air perpetually smells faintly of fresh lilies and expensive perfume.

The lobby, where Bartholomew spends most of his time, is the heart of the hotel. It's a grand, open space dominated by a massive crystal chandelier and flanked by two curving staircases that lead to the upper floors. To the left is the reception desk, a polished mahogany masterpiece manned by a rotating cast of equally elegant and multilingual staff. To the right, a discreetly marked entrance leads to the exclusive Le Dauphin Bleu restaurant. Beyond, lies a maze of lounges, ballrooms, and meeting rooms, all designed to cater to the needs of the discerning traveler, and the even more discerning residents who call the Grand Azure home. The entire atmosphere is one of understated luxury and carefully orchestrated perfection, a stage upon which Bartholomew Finch plays his pivotal role.
