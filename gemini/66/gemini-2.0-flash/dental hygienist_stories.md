## Story Opening:

The high-pitched whine of the ultrasonic scaler screeched, a familiar, albeit grating, symphony to Eloise Beatrice Peabody. She adjusted her magnification loupes, the tiny spotlights glinting off the iridescent, rainbow halo of plaque she was meticulously chiseling away from the lower lingual surface of Mrs. Higgins' left molar. Mrs. Higgins, bless her cotton socks, was snoring gently beneath the bib, a testament to Eloise's gentle hand and the mesmerizing hum of the dental office. Eloise found a perverse comfort in the routine, the predictable challenge of battling coffee stains and tenacious calculus. It was in the quiet, meticulous work that she found a strange solace, a tiny rebellion against the chaos that brewed just beneath the surface of her seemingly ordinary life. Today, however, even the familiar rhythm couldn't drown out the frantic drumming of her own heart. The envelope, addressed in crisp, professional calligraphy, burned a hole in her lab coat pocket, its contents a ticking time bomb that threatened to shatter the carefully constructed facade of her life.

## Setting:

Eloise works at "Dr. Thompson & Associates Family Dentistry," located in the quaint, albeit slightly decaying, town of Havenwood, Pennsylvania. The office, while modern in its equipment, retained a certain vintage charm. Think sterile white walls juxtaposed with antique oak furniture salvaged from the town's bygone era of lumber baron wealth. Framed black and white photographs of Havenwood's history adorned the waiting room, showing horse-drawn carriages and stiffly-posed families. Sunlight streamed through the large windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air, and offering a glimpse of Main Street's struggling businesses: a dusty antique shop, a perpetually empty bakery, and the perpetually bustling (and gossip-filled) post office. The air always smelled faintly of fluoride, disinfectant, and a hint of Dr. Thompson's ever-present pipe tobacco. It was a comfortable, predictable space, a haven (ironically) from the uncertainties of the outside world, at least until today.
