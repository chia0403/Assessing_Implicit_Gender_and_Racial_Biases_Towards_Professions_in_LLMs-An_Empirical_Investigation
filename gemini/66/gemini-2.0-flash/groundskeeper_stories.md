## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The story opens on a late October morning at Blackwood Manor, nestled deep within the overgrown and allegedly haunted forests of northern Vermont. Blackwood Manor isn't quite a castle, but it's close. Built in the late 1800s by a reclusive industrialist, it's a hulking, gothic pile of grey stone, complete with turrets, gargoyles, and a pervasive air of quiet decay. The grounds are vast and meticulously landscaped, despite the current owner, a distant descendant of the original builder, rarely visiting. The crisp autumn air is thick with the scent of damp leaves and the distant promise of snow.

**Opening:**

The whirring of the leaf blower, normally a comforting mechanical lullaby in the early morning quiet, died a sputtering death. Alistair Finch cursed under his breath, the sound barely audible over the rustling of the wind through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks that guarded Blackwood Manor. "Blast and damnation," he muttered, giving the stubborn machine a frustrated kick. It responded only with a metallic groan. Alistair, a man more comfortable with the company of rhododendrons than recalcitrant machinery, sighed. He hated this part of his job, but maintaining the manicured grounds of Blackwood Manor required a constant war against the encroaching wilderness.

Alistair Finch, Grounds Keeper, was, to put it mildly, an anomaly in this opulent and unsettling place. A gentle soul with hands permanently stained green, he preferred the quiet solitude of the gardens to the echoing grandeur of the manor itself. He knew every rose bush by name, could coax the most stubborn hydrangea into bloom, and treated the ancient weeping willows with the reverence one might reserve for a wise old friend. But today, with the leaf blower kaput and the air growing colder, a prickle of unease settled on the back of his neck, a feeling as familiar and unwelcome as the relentless Vermont weather. Blackwood Manor had a way of whispering secrets, and this morning, Alistair Finch felt like he was on the cusp of hearing one.
