Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a main character who is a logger:

**Setting:** The year is 1957. The setting is a logging camp called "Whispering Pines" nestled deep in the old-growth redwood forests of Humboldt County, California. It's a rugged, remote place, accessible only by a winding dirt road that becomes impassable during the winter rains. The camp itself is a collection of weathered cabins, a mess hall that smells perpetually of coffee and sawdust, a workshop buzzing with the sound of chainsaws, and a landing where the felled redwood giants are stacked, awaiting transport down the mountain. The air is thick with the scent of redwood sap, damp earth, and diesel fumes.

**Opening:**

The first rays of dawn, pale and watery, barely pierced the cathedral-like canopy above Whispering Pines. Elias Thorne, every inch of his six-foot-four frame a testament to hard labor, stood on the porch of his cabin, the chill morning air stinging his lungs. His calloused hands, permanently stained with sap and grime, cradled a steaming mug of coffee. Elias Thorne, a man built like a redwood himself, was a logger born and bred. He'd been swinging an axe since he was barely big enough to hold one, and the rhythm of the forest was as ingrained in him as the lines on his weathered face. Today, though, a knot of unease tightened in his gut. He'd felt it all night, a prickling sensation under his skin, like the forest itself was holding its breath. Something was different. And in a place as predictable, as rooted, as Whispering Pines, 'different' was a damn dangerous thing. He took a long swig of his coffee, the bitter liquid doing little to soothe the apprehension swirling inside him, and knew that, with the sun climbing higher, he had no choice but to do what he always did: head into the heart of the redwoods and meet the day head on.
