The biting wind howled a mournful tune around the eaves of "Tooth Acres," a name Dr. Alistair Bartholomew Finch had always found simultaneously charming and a little bit tragically on-the-nose. It was a late October evening in Porthaven, a seaside village nestled between the jagged cliffs of Cornwall and the churning, slate-grey Atlantic. Porthaven, with its cobblestone streets and houses clinging to the hillside like tenacious limpets, felt perpetually windswept and slightly damp, a quality that seemed to seep into the very bones of its inhabitants.

Inside Tooth Acres, Alistair, his tie loosened and the top button of his impeccably pressed Oxford shirt undone, stared out the bay window. The fishing boats, usually bobbing merrily in the harbour, were huddled together, their masts rocking uneasily. The lighthouse on Porthaven Point, a stoic sentinel against the encroaching gloom, blinked its rhythmic warning out to sea. Alistair hated storms. Not because of the obvious reasons – the power outages, the potential for damage – but because they always seemed to amplify the silence in his life. A silence that tonight, felt deafening.
