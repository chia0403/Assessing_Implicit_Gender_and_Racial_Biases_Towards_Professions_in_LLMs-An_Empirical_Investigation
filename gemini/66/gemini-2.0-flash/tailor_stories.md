## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The biting November wind howled a mournful tune down Harrowgate Lane, rattling the crooked windows of Mrs. Grimshaw's Tea Emporium and snatching at the frayed edges of posters advertising the upcoming Christmas Eve Ball. The cobblestones, slick with recent rain, reflected the dim glow emanating from the gas lamps that sputtered sporadically along the narrow street. It was precisely the sort of weather that drove honest folk inside, preferably near a roaring fire.

**Opening:** Elias Thorne, his fingers pricked raw and perpetually stained with the ghosts of chalk dust, didn't have the luxury of a roaring fire. He only had a temperamental coal stove that grudgingly radiated warmth in the closest proximity and a pile of velvet, as rich and midnight-blue as the pre-dawn sky, that represented his livelihood. He squinted at the intricate lace appliqué he was painstakingly stitching onto the bodice of Lady Beatrice Ashworth's Christmas Eve gown, the needle flashing silver under the weak light of his single electric lamp. A frustrated sigh escaped his lips, condensing into a small white puff that briefly fogged the spectacles perched precariously on his nose. This infernal lace refused to cooperate. He’d been at it for hours, the deadline looming like a hangman’s noose, and still, a tiny but noticeable puckering marred the otherwise flawless fabric. He knew Lady Beatrice, a woman renowned for her sharp tongue and even sharper eye for detail, would not be pleased. And a displeased Lady Beatrice meant a jeopardized reputation, a dried-up clientele, and potentially, a very bleak Christmas indeed for Elias Thorne, Master Tailor of Harrowgate Lane.
