The scent of disinfectant, stale coffee, and barely-controlled panic hung heavy in the air. Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the St. Judeâ€™s ER, a relentless drumming that mirrored the frantic rhythm of Dr. Eleanor Grace Thorne's pulse. It was a Tuesday night, past midnight, and the waiting room was overflowing with the usual cocktail of weekend injuries, substance-induced delirium, and the creeping desperation that always seemed to bloom after dark in this part of town. Eleanor, her scrubs rumpled and her dark hair escaping its bun, stood for a moment, hand pressed to her aching forehead, taking a shallow breath. She needed to triage. Now.

The setting was the emergency room of St. Jude's Hospital, a sprawling, underfunded institution clinging to the edge of a forgotten industrial district in the city of Oakhaven. St. Jude's was a magnet for the marginalized, the forgotten, and the uninsured, a place where hope often went to die a slow, agonizing death. The fluorescent lights hummed incessantly, casting a harsh, unflattering glare on the tired faces of the staff and the desperate pleas of the patients. The walls, once a pale shade of green, were now stained with the residue of countless spills and hurried cleanups, a testament to the relentless tide of human suffering that flowed through its doors every single day. It was a place Eleanor loved and hated with equal ferocity.
