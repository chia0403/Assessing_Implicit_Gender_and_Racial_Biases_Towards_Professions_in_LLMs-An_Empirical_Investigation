## Story Opening:

The scent of damp earth and stale hay clung to Elias Thorne's worn leather boots as he unlocked the heavy, wrought-iron gate. He'd smelled that same combination practically every day for the last fifteen years, and usually found it comforting, a familiar hug in a chaotic world. This morning, however, it just felt like a reminder of the endless work ahead. A plaintive bellow echoed from the depths of the sanctuary, a sound that gnawed at Elias's already frayed nerves. He sighed, the sound lost in the rustling of the ancient oaks that draped their branches over the perimeter of the Blackwood Wildlife Haven. "Alright, alright," he muttered to himself, pushing the gate open with a groan. "I'm coming, Elsie." He just hoped she wouldn't be too much trouble.

## Setting:

The Blackwood Wildlife Haven, nestled deep within the verdant folds of the Appalachian Mountains, was less a zoo and more a rescue center. The sprawling grounds encompassed over five hundred acres of rolling hills, dense forests, and a meandering creek that snaked its way through the property. Fenced enclosures of varying sizes housed a motley collection of animals: injured black bears, orphaned raccoons, a majestic bald eagle with a crippled wing, and a perpetually grumpy bison named Elsie, among others. The haven was a sanctuary of sorts, a place where these creatures could heal, recover, and, if possible, return to the wild. Elias's small, one-room cottage, overflowing with books on animal behavior and field guides, stood just inside the main gate, overlooking the heart of the haven. The air was perpetually thick with the sounds of the wild, punctuated by the rhythmic chugging of the generator that powered the electric fences and the occasional squeak of the old, rusty wheelbarrow Elias used to lug feed around. It was a beautiful, challenging, and often heartbreaking place, and for Elias, it was home.
