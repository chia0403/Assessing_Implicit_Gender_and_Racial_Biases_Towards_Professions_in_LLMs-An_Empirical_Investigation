## Story Opening:

The groan of the grader was a familiar symphony to him, a low, guttural rumble that vibrated up through his work boots and settled in his bones. Sweat plastered Michael Angelo Fiore's salt-and-pepper hair to his forehead as he wrestled with the controls, coaxing the behemoth along the uneven shoulder of Highway 93. The midday sun beat down with a merciless ferocity, turning the asphalt into a shimmering mirage. He squinted, wiping his brow with the back of a calloused hand, the orange safety vest clinging uncomfortably to his damp t-shirt.

He could smell the ozone crackling in the air, a sure sign a storm was brewing over the distant peaks of the Bitterroot Mountains. Michael just hoped it held off until quitting time. One thing he’d learned in twenty years patching asphalt and dodging semi-trucks on Montana highways: Mother Nature had a wicked sense of humor, and rarely played nice with road crews.

## Setting:

The story is set on a section of Highway 93 running through the Bitterroot Valley in Western Montana. Specifically, Michael and his crew are working on a stretch of highway about fifteen miles south of Hamilton, Montana, a small town nestled amongst rolling hills and sprawling cattle ranches. The landscape is dominated by the towering, snow-capped Bitterroot Mountains to the east and the more gentle Sapphire Mountains to the west.

The immediate surroundings are a blend of man-made disruption and natural beauty. The two-lane highway cuts a stark line through fields of golden hay and stands of ponderosa pine. Patches of wildflowers cling to the roadside, bravely blooming amidst the dust and gravel. Abandoned homesteads, their paint peeling and roofs sagging, stand as silent reminders of a bygone era. The air is thick with the smell of diesel, asphalt, and the sweet scent of wildflowers, a uniquely Montana cocktail that Michael has grown to both love and resent. The constant whir of passing traffic is a persistent backdrop to the rhythmic clanging and banging of the road crew’s equipment.
