Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a carpenter named Elara Willowbrook:

**Setting:**

The year is 1888. Dust motes danced in the shafts of afternoon light that pierced the grime-coated windows of Elara Willowbrook's workshop, a cramped space wedged between a bustling bakery and a dimly lit apothecary in the heart of Oakhaven, a rapidly growing logging town nestled in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains. The air, thick with the scent of pine resin, sawdust, and the faintest hint of yeast from next door, clung to everything. Outside, the rhythmic clang of hammers echoed from the neighboring lumber mill, a constant reminder of the industry that fueled Oakhavenâ€™s boom.

**Opening:**

Elara Willowbrook ran a calloused thumb along the smooth curve of the mahogany chair leg she'd been painstakingly shaping for the past week. Sweat beaded on her brow beneath the bandanna that held back her unruly auburn curls. Satisfied with the feel, she set it aside, the soft thud a momentary lull in the workshop's constant hum of activity. She wiped her hands on the well-worn leather apron that had belonged to her father, the faint scent of him, of wood and pipe tobacco, a comforting presence even in his absence. A frown tugged at the corner of her lips as she surveyed the half-finished projects scattered around her: a wobbly rocking horse for the miller's youngest, a sturdy pine coffin for old Mrs. Hemlock, and the most daunting of all, the intricately carved lectern for the new church being built on the hill. Time was running out, and so was her supply of decent timber, thanks to the unscrupulous practices of the logging baron who seemed intent on squeezing every last ounce of profit out of Oakhaven.
