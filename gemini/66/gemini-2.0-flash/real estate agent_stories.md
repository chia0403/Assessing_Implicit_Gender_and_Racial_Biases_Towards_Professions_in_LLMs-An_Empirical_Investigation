**Setting:** The oppressive humidity clung to Oak Haven, Georgia, like Spanish moss to ancient trees. It was mid-July, the air thick enough to chew on, and the sun beat down with a relentless intensity that faded paint and wilted flowerbeds. Cicadas buzzed a deafening chorus, the soundtrack to another sweltering afternoon in the heart of the Peach State. The real estate office, "Southern Charm Realty," was housed in a converted Victorian house, painted a cheerful but ultimately impractical shade of butter yellow. The peeling paint was a constant reminder of the relentless Georgia climate and the dwindling profits of a struggling agency.

**Story Opening:**

Beatrice Magnolia "Bea" Hawthorne slammed the door of her ancient Ford pickup truck, the force of the action making the already loose door swing even wider on its hinges. Sweat already beaded on her forehead, plastering stray strands of her fiery red hair to her temples. "Lord have mercy," she muttered, tugging at the collar of her floral sundress, "another day, another chance to melt into a puddle." Bea Hawthorne, Oak Haven's most tenacious and arguably most optimistic real estate agent, had seen better days. The market was slower than molasses in January, and the only calls she'd received all week were from telemarketers and Mrs. Peabody, who needed help extracting a particularly aggressive squirrel from her attic. Today, however, held a glimmer of hope. She had a showing at the old Carmichael place, a sprawling, albeit dilapidated, plantation house that had been sitting vacant for years. If she could just get someone, anyone, to see the potential… if she could just sell this house… well, maybe she could finally afford to fix that leaky roof at Southern Charm Realty. Maybe she could even afford a decent air conditioner.
