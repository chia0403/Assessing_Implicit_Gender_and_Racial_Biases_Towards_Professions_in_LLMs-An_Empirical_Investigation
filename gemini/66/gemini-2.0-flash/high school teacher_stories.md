## Story Opening:

The air in the teacher's lounge hung thick with the ghosts of stale coffee and whispered anxieties. Outside, the relentless Virginia summer pressed against the windows of Woodrow Wilson High School, a shimmering haze blurring the neatly manicured lawn. Inside, Ms. Amelia Rose Hawthorne, AP English teacher and general purveyor of dry wit, surveyed the carnage. Papers were piled precariously, a half-eaten bag of potato chips lay abandoned on the table, and Mrs. Petrelli was regaling anyone within earshot with the saga of her cat, Mittens, and his supposed existential crisis.

Amelia sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose. It was the Tuesday after Labor Day, the second day of the new school year, and she already felt the familiar creeping sense of exhaustion threatening to engulf her. She needed caffeine, and she needed it now. But the thought of venturing near the ancient, gurgling coffee machine filled with the sludge the faculty affectionately referred to as “Tar” was enough to make her consider driving to the Starbucks across the street, even if it meant enduring the judgmental stares of her students.

As Mrs. Petrelli’s voice rose in a crescendo of feline melodrama, Amelia decided she'd had enough. "Mittens is clearly experiencing a profound sense of ennui," she announced, her voice cutting through the chatter. "Perhaps he requires a reading of Camus? I have a spare copy of *The Stranger* if you're interested."

The room fell silent, and several pairs of eyes turned towards her, a mixture of amusement and relief flickering in their depths. Amelia smiled faintly. Yes, she thought, another year. Another generation of teenagers to mold, inspire, and occasionally, prevent from setting the science lab on fire. She just needed that coffee first.
