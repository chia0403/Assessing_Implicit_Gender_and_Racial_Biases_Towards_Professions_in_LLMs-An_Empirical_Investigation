The harsh fluorescent lights of Gate C12 cast long, unforgiving shadows across the tired faces waiting to board. Amelia Hayes adjusted her crisp, navy-blue scarf and smoothed down the lapels of her uniform jacket, forcing a smile. Inside, she was a tangled mess of pre-flight jitters and the lingering ache of another cross-country commute. Tonight's red-eye to Los Angeles promised the usual: cranky passengers, questionable turbulence, and the faint aroma of microwaved lasagna emanating from the galley.

Amelia, a seasoned flight attendant for Stellar Skies, had seen it all. Lost passports, mid-air marriage proposals, and one unforgettable incident involving a runaway chihuahua and a terrified businessman. Despite the occasional absurdity, she secretly loved the rhythm of her job, the feeling of soaring above the clouds, the fleeting connections with strangers bound together by the shared experience of flight. 

The setting: John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York City. 10:47 PM. The air hummed with a chaotic energy, a symphony of announcements, rolling suitcases, and hurried farewells. Beyond the gate, a Boeing 737 shimmered under the runway lights, waiting to swallow them whole and spit them out on the other side of the country. Tonight, Amelia Hayes was ready, or at least, she hoped she was. Tonight felt different. A low thrum of unease vibrated beneath the surface of the ordinary, a whisper in the wind promising something out of the ordinary was about to take flight.
