## Story Opening and Setting

**Opening:**

The scent of sawdust, blood, and rosemary hung thick in the air, a familiar comfort to Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield. He inhaled deeply, the sharp aroma momentarily drowning out the persistent ache in his shoulders. Heâ€™d been breaking down a particularly stubborn hindquarter of beef since dawn, and even his trusty cleaver felt heavy in his hand. Sweat beaded on his brow as he surveyed his handiwork: neat cuts of brisket, perfectly marbled roasts, and a pile of trimmings that would soon become the finest sausage in the Borough of Bloomsbury. Barty believed in using every last scrap, a principle instilled in him by his grandfather, the founder of Butterfield's Fine Meats. He wiped his brow with the back of his meaty hand, leaving a streak of crimson across his forehead. "Another day, another beast," he muttered to himself, a sliver of weariness creeping into his booming voice. But as he looked out the window, watching the morning sun illuminate the cobblestones of Lamb's Conduit Street, a flicker of something other than exhaustion stirred within him. Something akin to...unease.

**Setting:**

Butterfield's Fine Meats occupied a prime location on Lamb's Conduit Street, a quiet thoroughfare nestled in the heart of Bloomsbury, London. The year was 1888, and the city was a swirling vortex of progress and poverty, elegance and squalor. The shop itself was a testament to Victorian pride and craftsmanship. A gleaming mahogany counter ran the length of the room, its surface meticulously polished each morning. Behind it, rows of gleaming cleavers, knives, and saws hung in perfect order. The walls were tiled in pristine white, periodically interrupted by hand-painted advertisements for Butterfield's award-winning sausages and prime cuts. Outside, a striped awning shaded the display window, showcasing a carefully curated selection of meats, game, and poultry, all meticulously arranged to entice the discerning palate of the Bloomsbury gentry. The air was always cool, thanks to a clever system of ice blocks kept in the cellar, a constant reminder of the ingenuity and resourcefulness of the Butterfield family. Lamb's Conduit Street, with its mix of bookshops, antique dealers, and respectable residences, offered a veneer of civility and order, a stark contrast to the grimy underbelly that pulsed just beyond its borders. Yet, even in this haven of respectability, a sense of unease had begun to permeate the air, a subtle chill that even Barty Butterfield, with his years of experience handling cold carcasses, couldn't quite ignore.
