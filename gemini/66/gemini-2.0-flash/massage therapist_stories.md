**Story Opening:**

The scent of lavender and eucalyptus hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma that usually soothed even the most tightly wound clients. Not today. Today, it felt cloying, suffocating almost, a fragrant reminder of the crushing weight of responsibility pressing down on Serena Maria Rodriguez. She’d been staring at the appointment book for a solid ten minutes, the blank space beside “3:00 PM - Mr. Theodore Finch” mocking her with its emptiness. Mr. Finch, her most loyal and, frankly, most generous client, had cancelled. Again.

Serena sighed, running a hand through her already messy bun. It wasn’t just the lost income, though that stung. It was the nagging, unsettling feeling that something was terribly wrong. Mr. Finch was a creature of habit. Tuesdays at three, like clockwork, for the past five years. He rarely missed, and never without a lengthy, apologetic phone call. This abrupt cancellation, a curt text message riddled with typos, felt…off.

**Setting:**

Serena's Haven was a small, unassuming oasis tucked away on a quiet side street in the bustling city of Providence, Rhode Island. The exterior was painted a calming shade of seafoam green, with window boxes overflowing with vibrant petunias and trailing ivy. Inside, the space was meticulously designed to evoke a sense of tranquility. Soft lighting bathed the reception area, illuminating the smooth, river stone desk and the bubbling indoor fountain. Three treatment rooms branched off from the reception area, each decorated in a different calming color scheme - lavender, sage green, and soft blue - and equipped with plush massage tables, heated blankets, and a curated selection of calming music. A small break room in the back provided Serena with a space to prepare her aromatherapy blends, recharge between appointments, and, occasionally, eat a hastily-prepared lunch. The overall atmosphere was one of serene professionalism, a refuge from the chaotic energy of the city just beyond its doors.
