**Opening:**

The aroma of eucalyptus and desperation hung heavy in the air of the waiting room, a pungent cocktail Beatrice Eleanor Ainsworth had become intimately familiar with over the last seven years. A nervous tick in her left jaw flared as she re-read the article in the dog-eared copy of "Modern Home & Garden" about minimalist bathrooms. Minimalist bathrooms. The concept felt like a cruel joke considering the overflowing chaos that currently reigned in her own life, both professional and personal. A cough, raw and persistent, echoed from behind the potted ficus, and Beatrice sighed, placing the magazine back on the faux-wood table. Time to trade serenity for suffering.

**Setting:**

Beatrice Eleanor Ainsworth's chiropractic clinic, "Ainsworth Alignment," was nestled in a renovated Victorian house on a tree-lined street in the historic district of Savannah, Georgia. The building itself was painted a cheerful robin's egg blue, a deliberate attempt to counteract the anxiety most patients felt before their appointments. Inside, Beatrice had strived to create a soothing atmosphere with soft lighting, comfortable furniture, and the aforementioned aromatherapy diffuser that pumped out calming scents. However, no amount of carefully curated ambiance could completely mask the underlying tension that permeated the space - the aches, the pains, the stories of strained necks and slipped discs that walked through the door every day. The treatment room, where Beatrice spent most of her time, was a stark contrast to the cozy waiting room. It was a functional space, dominated by a state-of-the-art chiropractic table, anatomical charts, and a collection of well-worn diagnostic tools. Sunlight streamed through the large window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and casting long shadows across the room, hinting at the hidden struggles beneath the surface of each patient's physical ailments.
