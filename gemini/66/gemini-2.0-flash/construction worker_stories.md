The biting wind, a familiar foe on any steel girder over fifty feet up, whipped at Johnathan Elias Harding's exposed cheeks. He squinted, the setting sun reflecting off the mirrored windows of the rapidly-rising Vista Tower, a steel and glass behemoth that was slowly remaking the Chicago skyline. Lake Michigan, a vast expanse of choppy blue-grey, stretched out before him, churning restlessly against the concrete barrier of the Navy Pier. The air smelled of brine and concrete dust, a cocktail that Johnathan had come to associate with success, and a gnawing ache in his lower back.

Below, the city pulsed with the relentless rhythm of late afternoon: yellow cabs snaking through the streets like frantic bees, the distant wail of a police siren, the muffled roar of the 'L' train rattling overhead. It was a symphony of chaos, a soundtrack to Johnathan's workday. Today was the last day of phase three, and he could practically taste the overtime pay. He just had to make sure this last beam was set perfectly, and then, finally, he could head home to a hot shower and maybe, just maybe, a good night's sleep without dreaming of precariously balanced I-beams and the dizzying drop below.
