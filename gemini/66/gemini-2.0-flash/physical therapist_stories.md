Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a story featuring a physical therapist named Eleanor May Harding:

**Story Opening:**

The relentless Cape Cod wind, seasoned with the briny tang of the Atlantic, whipped at Eleanor May Harding’s ponytail as she wrestled with the clinic's stubborn door. It was a Friday afternoon, usually a time for waning patients and planning her weekend, but a deluge of referrals from the local orthopedic surgeon had crammed her schedule tight. Sighing, she finally managed to force the door open, a gust of slightly warmer, antiseptic-tinged air hitting her face. Inside, the comforting murmur of conversation and the rhythmic clang of weights offered a brief respite from the November chill. But the familiar comfort was tainted by the persistent throb in her own left knee – a nagging reminder that even healers need healing.

**Setting:**

Eleanor May Harding, known to most as Ellie, practices physical therapy at "Movement & Motion," a small, independent clinic in the quaint seaside town of Chatham, Massachusetts.

*   **The Town:** Chatham is a postcard-perfect Cape Cod town, known for its weathered shingle houses, white picket fences, and stunning views of the Atlantic Ocean. Tourism is a major industry, especially during the summer months. Outside of peak season, a quieter, more close-knit community prevails. Fishing is a major occupation.
*   **The Clinic:** "Movement & Motion" is located in a converted cottage just off Main Street. It's charmingly rustic, with exposed wooden beams and nautical-themed decor. Large windows let in plenty of natural light. The clinic is equipped with standard physical therapy equipment: treadmills, stationary bikes, weight machines, parallel bars, treatment tables, and a hydrocollator for hot packs. There's a small reception area with comfortable chairs and a coffee machine. Ellie has personalized her office with plants, framed photos of her family, and anatomical posters. It’s a welcoming space, reflecting Ellie’s approachable and empathetic personality.
*   **The Time:** The story begins in late November, just before Thanksgiving. The off-season has settled in, bringing a slower pace to the town, but a unique set of challenges for Ellie and her patients. The weather is unpredictable, and the shorter days can impact mood and motivation.

I hope this is a good starting point for your story! Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on anything or explore other ideas.
