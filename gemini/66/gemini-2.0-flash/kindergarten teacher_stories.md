The aroma of freshly baked sugar cookies, slightly burnt around the edges, mingled with the faint, lingering scent of glitter glue and Elmer's. Outside, a late October wind howled, rattling the window panes of Room 104 at Little Sprouts Academy. Inside, a miniature jungle reigned: paper-mâché monkeys swung precariously from the coat hooks, construction paper leaves littered the floor like confetti, and the general din of twenty-three five-year-olds rehearsing their "Five Little Pumpkins" song threatened to overwhelm the otherwise cozy space.

Taking a deep breath, **Ms. Eleanor Penelope Fairchild** adjusted her oversized glasses, a strand of auburn hair escaping from the loose braid cascading down her back. She surveyed her domain, a small, albeit weary, smile gracing her lips. The chaos was manageable. She had survived worse. Last Tuesday, for instance, when Timothy mistook finger paint for yogurt. Today, the challenge was keeping everyone focused enough to remember their lines before Mrs. Higgins, the notoriously stern principal, came for the final dress rehearsal. Eleanor knew, with a certainty only kindergarten teachers possess, that the next hour would be a true test of her patience, creativity, and ability to convince a room full of tiny humans that the best part of pumpkin acting was *not* trying to eat their construction paper costumes.
