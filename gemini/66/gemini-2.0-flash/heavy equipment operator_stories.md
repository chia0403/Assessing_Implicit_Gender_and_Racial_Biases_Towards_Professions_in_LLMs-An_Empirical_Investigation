**Opening:**

The smell of diesel was Martha Eleanor Olsen's morning perfume. It clung to her work boots, permeated the fabric of her Carhartt overalls, and even seemed to seep into the thick braid that ran down her back. The low rumble of the Cat 966M wheel loader vibrating beneath her boots was her alarm clock, a song she knew by heart. This morning, however, the familiar rhythm was off. A nagging unease prickled at the back of her neck, a sensation as uncomfortable and persistent as a stray pebble in her steel-toed boot. Maybe it was the oppressive humidity clinging to the air, promising another scorcher. Or maybe, Martha thought, glancing at the skeletal remains of the abandoned mine stretching before her, it was something more...

**Setting:**

Martha Eleanor Olsen's workspace was the ravaged landscape surrounding the Blackwood Consolidated Mine, nestled deep within the Appalachian foothills of West Virginia. Decades ago, the Blackwood had been the lifeblood of the small, now-dying town of Harmony Creek, providing jobs and prosperity. But the veins of coal had run dry, leaving behind a scarred and gutted earth. The towering slag heaps loomed like monstrous gravestones over the valley, casting long, somber shadows. Red clay mud clung to everything, and the air hung heavy with the ghosts of a forgotten industry. Now, Blackwood Reclamation, Martha's employer, was tasked with the herculean effort of restoring the land, one scoop of earth at a time, to some semblance of its former natural glory. The project was ambitious, the odds were long, and the silence that hung over the mine, broken only by the grinding gears and the mournful cry of the occasional hawk, was deafening.
