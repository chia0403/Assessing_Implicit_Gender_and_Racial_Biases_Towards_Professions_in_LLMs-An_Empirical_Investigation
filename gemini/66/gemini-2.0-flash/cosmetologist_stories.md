Okay, here's a story opening with a main character who is a cosmetologist:

**Story Opening & Setting:**

The bell above the door of "Shear Delights" chimed a cheerful, if somewhat desperate, melody, completely at odds with the grim expression on the face of its owner, Genevieve Eleanor Rose. It was a Tuesday, usually a slow day, but today it felt glacial. Genevieve watched as Mrs. Gable, her only client of the morning, wobbled out, a bouffant as stiff and formidable as her personality.

The salon, located in the heart of the stubbornly-retro Maplewood district of Oak Haven, New Jersey, was Genevieve’s pride and… increasingly, her frustration. She'd sunk every penny, every carefully saved tip from her early years working at "Clip Joint," into this space. The walls were a soft, vintage pink; the chairs, lovingly reupholstered in a floral print that was once cutting edge and now just… *there*; and the air, usually thick with the scent of perm solution and hairspray, felt stagnant.

Outside, the late September sun cast long, melancholy shadows across Maplewood Avenue, highlighting the chipped paint on the Victorian storefronts. It felt like the entire town, like Genevieve herself, was stuck in a sepia-toned photograph, yearning for a splash of color. And right now, Genevieve needed a miracle, and a hefty injection of cash, to keep Shear Delights from becoming just another faded memory on a charming, but dying, main street.
