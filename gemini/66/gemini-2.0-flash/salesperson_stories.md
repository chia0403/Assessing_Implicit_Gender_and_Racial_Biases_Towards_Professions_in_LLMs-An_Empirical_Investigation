## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The fluorescent lights of the breakroom hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the mid-afternoon slump at Sterling Dynamics. Half-empty coffee cups and crumpled sales reports littered the sticky, faux-wood table. Beyond the small window, the gray sky of Seattle threatened another downpour, mirroring the mood inside.

**Opening:**

Arthur Reginald Finch adjusted his tie, the knot feeling particularly constricting today. He stared into the lukewarm reflection in the stainless steel microwave door, trying to smooth out the worry lines etched around his eyes. Another week, another mountain of rejection emails mocking his inbox. Arthur, a seasoned salesman with Sterling Dynamics for the past fifteen years, had once been their golden boy, a charismatic closer who could sell ice to Eskimos. Now, he felt like a rusty cog in a rapidly modernizing machine, his old tricks feeling increasingly… well, old. He sighed, the breath fogging the microwave door momentarily. He needed a win. He needed a miracle. He needed… a new cup of coffee. But the coffee maker just gurgled pathetically, another reminder of his diminishing returns. "This," he muttered to himself, "is not how I envisioned my Friday afternoon."
