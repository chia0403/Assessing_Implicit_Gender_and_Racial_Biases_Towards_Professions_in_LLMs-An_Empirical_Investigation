The stale, lemon-scented air of the Westchester County Surrogate’s Court did little to mask the scent of money, simmering just beneath the surface of genteel whispers and forced civility. Sunlight, fractured by the leaded glass windows, dappled the courtroom in squares of gold and shadow, illuminating the worn mahogany benches and the impassive face of Judge Thompson. Standing before him, poised and ramrod straight, was Ms. Seraphina Rose Albright, Esq. Her crisp, navy blue suit, the only splash of color against the room's muted tones, spoke of competence and quiet authority. She’d been practicing probate law for fifteen years, and she knew this battlefield intimately. More importantly, she knew how to win.

Seraphina smoothed the perfectly tailored lapel of her jacket, a nervous habit she’d tried, and failed, to break. She was representing the executor of the esteemed Mrs. Eleanor Van Derlyn's estate, a case that had already generated more gossip and backstabbing than Seraphina typically encountered in a year. Mrs. Van Derlyn, a philanthropist and socialite of formidable reputation, had left behind a fortune, a sprawling estate in Bedford, and a will that was, to put it mildly, contentious. The air crackled with the simmering animosity between the beneficiaries, a motley crew of distant relatives, grasping charities, and a suspiciously attentive young "companion" who claimed Mrs. Van Derlyn had promised him a substantial inheritance in exchange for his, shall we say, devoted friendship. Seraphina knew this case had the potential to make or break her career, and she was ready. The game, as they say, was afoot.
