The late afternoon sun, already a swollen orange, beat down on the asphalt shingles like a hammer on an anvil. Sweat dripped from Thomas "Tommy" Rileyâ€™s brow, stinging his eyes. He wiped it away with the back of his calloused hand, leaving a streak of grime across his forehead. He could taste the grit in the air - a mixture of asphalt dust, dried leaves, and the faint, acrid tang of chimney soot.

Tommy paused, straightened his back, and took a deep breath, the smell of old wood and sun-baked tar filling his lungs. He was perched precariously on the steep, gambrel roof of the old Victorian house on Elm Street in the historic district of Belleville, Illinois. Below him, the meticulously manicured lawns and rose bushes seemed impossibly distant and orderly compared to the chaotic mess of shingles he was wrestling with.

The house itself was a study in faded grandeur. Once painted a vibrant, almost defiant, shade of robin's egg blue, the clapboard siding now wore a patchy coat of flaking paint, revealing the grey, weathered wood beneath. Gingerbread trim clung precariously to the eaves, some pieces missing altogether, leaving gaping holes that whistled mournfully in the afternoon breeze. The wraparound porch sagged slightly, one of the ornate support columns leaning inward like a tired old man.

Tommy Riley had been roofing in Belleville for almost fifteen years, and he knew this house well. Not just this particular house, but these *types* of houses. The grand old dames of Belleville, built in an era when craftsmanship mattered and details were everything. They were beautiful, yes, but they were also a pain in the ass. Every shingle was a battle, every repair a puzzle. And this particular roof? Well, this one was going to be a doozy.
