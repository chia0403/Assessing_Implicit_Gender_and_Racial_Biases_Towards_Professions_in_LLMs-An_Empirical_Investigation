The chipped porcelain teacup trembled in Maria Elena Rodriguez's hand, the delicate floral pattern blurring as she nervously sipped the lukewarm tea. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, rattling the aged windows of Blackwood Manor and tugging at the ivy that relentlessly clung to its weathered stone facade. The manor, perched precariously on the cliffs overlooking the churning Atlantic, always felt more like a living, breathing entity than a mere building, and tonight, it seemed agitated.

Maria Elena, a woman hardened by years of quiet resilience and blessed with a keen eye for detail, had been housekeeper at Blackwood Manor for nearly fifteen years. Fifteen years of polishing silver that hadn’t been used since before the war, of dusting forgotten portraits of stern-faced Blackwood ancestors, and of keeping the sprawling, gothic relic from crumbling entirely into the sea.

The Manor was a testament to faded grandeur, a silent sentinel guarding secrets that whispered through the drafts and echoed in the cavernous halls. It was filled with the scent of beeswax, old paper, and a faint, almost metallic, tang that Maria Elena could never quite place. Tonight, however, the usual scent was overlaid with something else: a prickling unease that settled heavy in her stomach and made the hairs on her arms stand on end. She finished her tea, the cup clattering slightly against the saucer. It was time to start her evening rounds, and tonight, even the familiar creaks and groans of Blackwood Manor felt…different.
