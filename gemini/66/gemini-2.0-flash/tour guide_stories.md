The humid Louisiana air hung thick and sweet, a cloying perfume of magnolia and damp earth that clung to your clothes and coated your skin. Seraphina Bellefontaine, resplendent in a crisp white linen shirt and khaki shorts (her usual uniform, weather be damned), adjusted the brim of her straw hat and surveyed the group gathered at the wrought iron gates of Oak Alley Plantation. Sunlight dripped like honey through the ancient oak trees, their gnarled limbs draped in shimmering Spanish moss, creating an ethereal, almost dreamlike atmosphere. Today, the air was particularly heavy, pregnant with the promise of a storm.

Seraphina knew this place like the back of her hand, every crack in the ancient bricks of the Big House, every twist in the roots of the magnificent oaks that lined the alley. She'd been giving tours here for five years, regaling tourists with tales of love and loss, ambition and betrayal, of fortunes made and fortunes lost, all woven together in the rich, often brutal, tapestry of Louisiana history. Today, however, she felt a particular unease, a prickling on the back of her neck that had nothing to do with the humidity. As she launched into her usual opening spiel, about the history of Jacques Roman and the enslaved people who had built and maintained the sugar empire, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was about to disrupt the delicate balance of Oak Alley's carefully curated past.
