The cloying scent of jasmine hung heavy in the humid Charleston air, doing little to mask the ever-present tang of salt and decay that clung to the old city. Rain, a persistent, melancholic drizzle, slicked the cobblestones of Chalmers Street, reflecting the gas lamps in distorted puddles. Isabella Grace Montgomery pulled her trench coat tighter, the damp seeping through even the thickest wool. She hated Charleston in the rain. It seemed to amplify the city's ghosts, making them whisper louder, their stories laced with a bitterness that threatened to cling to your soul.

Isabella, known to her colleagues at the *Charleston Courier* as "Monty" for her unflinching pursuit of truth, stopped outside a wrought-iron gate nearly swallowed by ivy. Behind it, the grand facade of the Rutledge House, once a beacon of Southern aristocracy, now stood shrouded in shadows, its peeling paint and boarded-up windows telling a tale of faded glory. This was where the story was supposed to be, the story that could finally get her off the society pages and back onto the front lines.
