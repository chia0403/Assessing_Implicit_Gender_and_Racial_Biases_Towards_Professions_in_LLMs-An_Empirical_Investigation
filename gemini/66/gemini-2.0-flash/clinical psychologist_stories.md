The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack Dr. Eleanor Vance had grown intimately familiar with over her fifteen years at St. Jude's Psychiatric Clinic. Tonight, however, the hum seemed louder, more insistent, mirroring the tremor in her own hands as she reread the case file. Rain lashed against the window of her cramped, book-lined office, blurring the sodium glow of the streetlights outside into impressionistic smears. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and the vague disinfectant used to mask the pervasive aroma of anxiety.

Dr. Eleanor Vance, PhD, was a woman of routine, of careful observations, of meticulously crafted rapport. She was a lighthouse in the storm of other people's minds. Yet, tonight, the lighthouse felt a little shaky. The case file, labeled with a stark, impersonal "Doe, John," held the potential to either reinforce her years of training or shatter the carefully constructed edifice of her professional self. The referral had come with a single, chilling notation: "Possible Dissociative Identity Disorder. Extreme caution advised." Eleanor took a deep breath, the scent of coffee clinging to the back of her throat. Time to meet John Doe.
