Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring an occupational therapist named:

**Full Name:** Dr. Eleanor Marguerite Ainsworth

**Story Opening:**

The insistent buzzing of the old rotary phone in her cramped office was a welcome intrusion, a lifeline in the swirling vortex of paperwork and patient charts threatening to engulf Eleanor Ainsworth whole. She hadn’t upgraded to a push-button model – partly out of stubborn nostalgia, partly because the clunky rotary was a surprisingly effective stress reliever. Each deliberate spin of the dial, the satisfying click as it swung back, was a tiny act of resistance against the relentless demands of her profession.

"Ainsworth Occupational Therapy, Eleanor Ainsworth speaking," she said, her voice warm despite the fatigue that clung to her like a damp wool blanket.

The voice on the other end was hesitant, elderly, laced with a tremor that spoke of years etched into bone and muscle. "Dr. Ainsworth? My name is Mrs. Hazelwood. My grandson, Arthur, told me you... you might be able to help."

Eleanor leaned back in her creaky swivel chair, the springs groaning in protest. "Tell me about Arthur, Mrs. Hazelwood." She already knew, of course. Arthur Hazelwood, a promising young artist, paralyzed from the chest down after a car accident six months ago. His case was on her radar, referred by the rehabilitation center, but she hadn’t yet had the space in her schedule to take him on. The hope in Mrs. Hazelwood's voice, fragile as spun glass, spurred her. "Let's see what we can do."

**Setting:**

The story is set in the small, historically-rich town of Havenwood, Maine. The town clings to the rugged coastline, its economy a blend of fishing, tourism, and a surprising number of artisan workshops. Eleanor's office is located on the second floor of a weathered Victorian building on Main Street, right above the local bakery.

**Specifics of Eleanor's Office:**

*   **Aromas:** The ever-present scent of freshly baked bread drifts up from the bakery below, often mingling with the faint medicinal odor of liniments and antiseptic wipes Eleanor uses.
*   **Décor:** The office is a chaotic but cozy space. Sunlight streams through the large, dust-streaked window, illuminating shelves overflowing with adaptive devices – specialized utensils, built-up grips for pens, ergonomic keyboards.
*   **Furniture:** The worn leather couch, rescued from a flea market, is often occupied by patients waiting their turn or exhausted family members seeking a moment's respite. The aforementioned rotary phone sits proudly on a small, antique side table.
*   **Overall Atmosphere:** It feels less like a sterile clinical environment and more like a well-loved, slightly eccentric home. The walls are adorned with patient artwork, thank-you notes, and framed degrees, creating a tapestry of stories and accomplishments.

This setting helps establish Eleanor's character as someone who values connection, history, and practicality over sterile efficiency. It's a place where healing happens, not just of the body, but also of the spirit.
