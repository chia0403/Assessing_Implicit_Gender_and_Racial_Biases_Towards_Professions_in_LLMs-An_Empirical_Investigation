The biting January wind howled like a banshee down Oakhaven Drive, whipping snowflakes against the grimy windshield of Beatrice “Bea” Bumble’s ancient Ford pickup. Bea, whose name always felt a bit too cheerful for her perpetually grumpy disposition, tightened her grip on the steering wheel and squinted. Oakhaven was a street lined with grand, Victorian-era houses, their gables and turrets silhouetted against the bruised twilight sky. The kind of houses with plumbing so antiquated it was practically archaeological.

Bea Bumble, plumber extraordinaire (at least, that's what her business cards said), hated Oakhaven Drive. The residents, dripping in inherited wealth and perpetually clutching miniature, yapping dogs, always treated her like she was tracking mud into their priceless Persian rugs, even when she took meticulous care. Tonight, however, the potential for judgment was the least of her worries.

She’d been called to the Worthington Estate, the largest and most ostentatious house on the street, for what Mrs. Worthington had dramatically described as a “catastrophic water incident.” Catastrophic usually meant a leaky faucet in Bea’s experience, but the chill in the air, mixed with the growing darkness, gave her a creeping feeling that tonight might be different. The Worthington Estate, with its sprawling grounds and eerie silence, had always given her the creeps. And Bea Bumble trusted her gut. Her gut, after all, had helped her diagnose more plumbing problems than any fancy pressure gauge ever could.
