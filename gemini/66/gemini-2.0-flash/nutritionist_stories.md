Okay, here's a story opening and setting, introducing our nutritionist:

**Opening:**

The aroma of burnt almonds hung heavy in the air, a small, acrid betrayal of the otherwise meticulously curated atmosphere of Dr. Vivian Holloway’s kitchen. Vivian, in her crisp white lab coat (a deliberate, slightly performative touch for her early morning clients), swore under her breath. She'd been so focused on perfecting the antioxidant-rich smoothie for Mrs. Abernathy, whose wrinkles were starting to resemble a topographical map of the Grand Canyon, that she'd completely neglected the homemade granola.

A ping from her phone cut through the silence. It was Mrs. Abernathy, of course. "Running a bit late, dear! Tennis elbow flared up. See you in twenty."

Vivian groaned. Twenty minutes to salvage the granola situation, restock the Himalayan pink salt (Mrs. Abernathy was convinced it contained the secret to eternal youth), and compose herself. Twenty minutes to transform from a slightly frantic, almond-smelling mess into the picture of calm, collected nutritional wisdom that her clients paid handsomely for. This was the glamorous life of a nutritionist in Willow Creek, she thought, the irony dripping like burnt caramel.

**Setting:**

The story unfolds in Willow Creek, a wealthy, health-obsessed suburb nestled just outside of Portland, Oregon. Think tree-lined streets, yoga studios on every corner, and farmers markets brimming with organic kale. Vivian's office, which is attached to her modern, minimalist home, is a gleaming sanctuary of wellness. Sunlight streams through large windows, illuminating shelves lined with cookbooks, jars of exotic spices, and meticulously labeled supplement bottles. There's a state-of-the-art blender that could probably power a small city and a scale that analyzes everything from body fat percentage to cellular hydration levels. The overall vibe is less sterile doctor's office and more zen-like spa, designed to put clients at ease and inspire them to embrace a healthier lifestyle – even if it means drinking kale smoothies and sprinkling Himalayan pink salt on everything. The setting reflects the pressures and expectations that come with catering to a clientele that's both affluent and deeply invested in the pursuit of perfect health.
