Okay, here's a story opening and setting centered around a bell hop named Bartholomew "Bart" Finch:

**Setting:**

The grand Hotel Regal, nestled in the heart of New Orleans' French Quarter, circa 1938. The air hangs thick with the scent of jasmine, river mud, and stale whiskey. The hotel, despite its age, still exudes an air of faded opulence. Gilded mirrors line the lobby walls, reflecting the soft glow of crystal chandeliers. Polished mahogany counters gleam under the watchful eye of the perpetually bored concierge. The constant hum of jazz music drifts in from the nearby bars, a vibrant undercurrent to the genteel facade.

**Story Opening:**

Bartholomew "Bart" Finch adjusted his pillbox hat, the braided gold trim itching at his forehead. Another sweltering Louisiana afternoon, another wave of tourists rolling into the Hotel Regal, their faces flushed with heat and anticipation. He leaned against one of the ornate brass luggage carts, a silent observer of the unfolding drama. Heâ€™d seen it all before: honeymooners giddy with newlywed bliss, weary businessmen clutching briefcases full of secrets, and socialites draped in furs despite the stifling humidity.

Today, though, felt different. An electric hum vibrated beneath the surface of the usual chaos. The doorman, Old Man Thibodeaux, usually unflappable, kept glancing nervously towards the entrance. Bart himself had noticed a sleek, black Packard pull up a few minutes ago, a car that screamed money, and a certain kind of danger.

He straightened, his back instinctively going ramrod straight as a woman emerged from the car. She was striking, almost unsettlingly so. Dressed in a scarlet dress that clung to her like a second skin, she moved with a feline grace that made Bart swallow hard. A wide-brimmed hat obscured most of her face, but the flash of dark eyes hinted at a tempest brewing beneath the surface. As she approached the hotel entrance, Bart noticed two men, grim-faced and built like brick houses, flank her, their gazes sweeping the lobby with suspicious intensity.

Something told Bartholomew Finch, seasoned observer of the Hotel Regal's comings and goings, that this woman wasn't here for a vacation. This was a storm brewing, and he, Bartholomew Finch, bellhop extraordinaire, was about to get caught right in the middle of it.
