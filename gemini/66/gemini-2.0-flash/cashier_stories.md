## Opening:

The bell above the door of "The Corner Stop" jingled, a sound that was both a greeting and a low-grade torment to Beatrice Eleanor Hamilton. It signaled another customer, another transaction, another step closer to the end of her shift. Beatrice, her nametag slightly askew and her ponytail threatening to unravel, plastered a practiced smile on her face. She was getting good at this, the fake smile, the rote responses, the scanning of chips and gum and lottery tickets with a speed bordering on the mechanical. Tonight, however, the usual humdrum felt different. A low, almost imperceptible tremor ran through the air, a vibration that tickled the fillings in her teeth. She glanced around, expecting to see a truck rumble past, but the street outside was deserted, bathed in the eerie orange glow of the sodium streetlights. The tremor subsided, leaving only an unsettling silence that amplified the rhythmic hum of the freezer cases.

## Setting:

"The Corner Stop," as its faded neon sign proudly proclaimed, was a classic small-town convenience store. Situated on the intersection of Elm Street and Oak Avenue in the fictional town of Havenwood, Ohio, it was a repository for all things mundane and necessary. Shelves overflowing with brightly colored snacks, sugary cereals, and rows of dusty canned goods lined the walls. The air perpetually smelled of stale coffee and lottery scratch-offs. A magazine rack near the door displayed a mix of celebrity gossip and hunting guides, catering to Havenwood's diverse, if somewhat predictable, clientele. The floor was a checkered linoleum, worn smooth in the high-traffic areas, and the fluorescent lights buzzed with a relentless energy that seemed to drain the life out of everything beneath them, including Beatrice Eleanor Hamilton. Outside, Havenwood itself was a picture of small-town Americana, with well-maintained houses, manicured lawns, and a general air of quiet complacency, a complacency that, tonight, felt precariously thin.
