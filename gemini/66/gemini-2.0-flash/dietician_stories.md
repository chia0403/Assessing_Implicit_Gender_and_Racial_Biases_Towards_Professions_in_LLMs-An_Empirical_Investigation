The aroma of roasted sweet potatoes, subtly spiced with cinnamon and a hint of nutmeg, hung heavy in the air of "Balanced Bites," Amelia Josephine Hawthorne's tiny, but fiercely beloved, dietician practice. Outside, the November wind howled a mournful tune down Elm Street in Harmony Creek, Ohio. The late afternoon light, filtering through the frosted windowpanes, painted long, distorted shadows across the waiting room. Wicker chairs, carefully chosen for comfort and not aesthetic appeal, sat empty, save for the plump, hand-stitched cushions Amelia had crafted herself. The walls, painted a calming sage green, were adorned with framed prints of vibrant fruits and vegetables, each meticulously labelled with its nutritional benefits. Harmony Creek, population barely scraping 5,000, was the kind of place where everyone knew your business, but also the kind of place where Amelia Josephine Hawthorne felt she could make a real difference. It was a town where apple pies were a religion and the word "kale" still elicited a confused scrunch of the nose. And Amelia, armed with her boundless enthusiasm for healthy eating and a truly impressive understanding of metabolic pathways, was determined to change that, one sweet potato at a time. Today, however, even the comforting scent of her favourite root vegetable couldn't quite chase away the knot of anxiety twisting in her stomach. Her first patient of the afternoon, a notoriously stubborn baker named Agnes Butterfield, was running late, and Amelia had a sneaking suspicion it wasn't because she was stuck in traffic.
