## The Story Opening:

The biting wind whipped off the Baltic Sea, stinging Amelia Rose Harding's exposed cheeks. She huddled deeper into her threadbare wool coat, the collar scratching against her jaw. The grainy black and white photo she held, a relic from a bygone era, threatened to tear in the gale. Her breath plumed white in the air, a stark contrast to the somber grey that permeated everything - the sky, the sea, the crumbling brick of the abandoned Soviet-era fisheries research station behind her. 

A solitary crow cawed overhead, its cry echoing the desolation that permeated this forgotten corner of Estonia. This was exactly what she'd expected, and yet the reality somehow felt colder, more haunting, than any archive image or hushed rumour could convey. This was where it happened. This was where it all went wrong. This was where Amelia Rose Harding hoped to find the truth.

## The Setting:

The story is set in **Paldiski, Estonia**, a port city on the Pakri peninsula, overlooking the Baltic Sea. The current year is **2023**. 

Paldiski carries a heavy Soviet legacy. Once a closed city, a restricted military zone housing a nuclear submarine training center, it now stands as a stark reminder of a lost empire. The city is a mix of crumbling Soviet-era architecture and the nascent signs of modern development. The atmosphere is bleak, tinged with a lingering sense of secrecy and lingering Cold War tensions. The abandoned fisheries research station specifically is located just outside the main city, clinging to the coast. It's a decaying concrete behemoth, marked by rust, graffiti, and broken windows. The interior is a labyrinth of echoing corridors, decaying laboratories, and forgotten equipment. The location is isolated and exposed, offering a chilling glimpse into the past and a sense of unease that clings to the salt-laden air.
