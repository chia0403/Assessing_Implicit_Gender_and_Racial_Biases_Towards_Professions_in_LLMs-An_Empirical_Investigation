The hum of the Kenworth’s tires on the endless ribbon of asphalt was a lullaby to Jedediah Elias Thorne. He’d heard it countless times, a constant, rhythmic drone that resonated deep in his chest, a vibration that echoed the steady throb of his own heart. Tonight, however, the lullaby wasn’t working. Jedediah gripped the wheel, his knuckles white against the worn leather, and wrestled with the gnawing unease that had been his unwelcome companion for the past two hundred miles.

The setting was the black heart of rural Nevada, Highway 50, the so-called "Loneliest Road in America." Outside, the inky blackness was punctuated only by the stark glare of Jedediah’s headlights, cutting swaths through the darkness and occasionally catching the reflective eyes of some unseen creature lurking at the roadside. The landscape was a desolate tableau of scrub brush and rocky outcroppings, bathed in the pale, ethereal glow of a half-moon. The radio crackled with static, offering only fragments of distant broadcasts, and the air in the cab was thick with the scent of stale coffee and diesel. Jedediah was hauling a load of unspecified "sensitive materials" from Fallon to somewhere near Tonopah, a job he’d taken for the fat paycheck and the promise of minimal questions asked. But something about the consignment, about the hush-hush nature of the deal, and about the unnerving silence of this stretch of highway, had Jedediah on edge. He felt like he was being watched.
