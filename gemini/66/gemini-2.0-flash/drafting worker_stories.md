Okay, here's a story opening and setting, with a main character who is a drafting worker:

**Story Opening:**

The blueprint, a sprawling, geometric beast of intersecting lines and precisely labeled dimensions, trembled slightly under Elias Thorne's calloused fingertips. He squinted, the fluorescent lights of the drafting room reflecting harshly off his thick-rimmed glasses. The air, thick with the faint odor of pencil lead and stale coffee, vibrated with the low hum of the aging HVAC system. He’d been staring at the schematic for the proposed expansion of the Sterling & Sons Foundry for the better part of six hours, and the damned thing still looked like a chaotic spiderweb spun by a particularly unhinged arachnid. Something was wrong. He could feel it, a tiny discordant note in the symphony of right angles and perfect circles.

He tapped a graphite-stained fingernail against the vellum, tracing the planned route of the new conveyor belt. It was supposed to carry molten metal from the furnace to the casting molds. Simple. Except, according to his calculations, and he'd checked them three times, the belt's support structure would interfere with the existing steam lines. He’d pointed it out to Mr. Sterling himself, the owner’s son and recent hire, a man whose only qualification appeared to be inheriting a name. Mr. Sterling had dismissed him with a condescending chuckle and a pat on the shoulder. "Don't worry your little head about it, Elias. We'll make it work."

Elias Thorne hated being patted on the shoulder. And he hated being wrong. But most of all, he hated when a cocky, silver-spoon-fed heir was about to make a catastrophically stupid mistake.

**Setting:**

The year is 1985. The setting is the cluttered, slightly dilapidated drafting room of Sterling & Sons Foundry in the gritty industrial district of Newark, New Jersey. The room is functional, not pretty. Rows of drafting tables, each scarred with years of use, are illuminated by harsh fluorescent lights. Blueprints, technical manuals, and half-empty coffee cups clutter every surface. A large blueprint plotter whirs intermittently in the corner. The walls are painted a dull, institutional green and are adorned with framed but faded photographs of past Sterling & Sons projects, showcasing everything from iron bridges to decorative gates. The window, grimy and streaked with rain, offers a bleak view of the surrounding factories and warehouses. A constant, low-level din of machinery can be heard from the foundry floor below, punctuated by the occasional clang of metal or hiss of steam. The air is thick with the smells of metalworking, oil, and the aforementioned stale coffee. The room is a hive of quiet, meticulous work, often overlooked but absolutely essential to the operation of the entire foundry.
