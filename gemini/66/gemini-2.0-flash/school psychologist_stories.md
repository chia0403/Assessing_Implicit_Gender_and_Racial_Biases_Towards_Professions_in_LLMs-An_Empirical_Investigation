## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights of Birchwood Elementary hummed a monotonous drone, a soundtrack to Dr. Alistair Finch's Tuesday. Rain lashed against the window of his small, cluttered office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside him. He pushed aside a stack of permission slips, the edges dog-eared and stained with what looked suspiciously like orange juice, and leaned back in his creaky chair, the springs groaning in protest. He'd spent the last hour mediating a feud between two fourth graders over a coveted glitter glue stick, and the saccharine fumes of glitter glue and unmet expectations still clung to the air.

He rubbed his tired eyes, the bridge of his nose aching. He loved his job, truly. Helping children navigate the choppy waters of childhood was rewarding, fulfilling, even. But today, a persistent unease prickled at the back of his neck, a feeling that something significant, something *different*, was about to happen. He glanced at the weather report he'd absentmindedly printed out earlier - a simple image of a smiling sun obliterated by a menacing gray cloud. He didn't usually put much stock in omens, but the image seemed eerily fitting.

The feeling intensified as a knock echoed on his office door. He took a deep breath, plastered on a professional smile, and called out, "Come in!"
## Setting:

**Birchwood Elementary School**, nestled in the quaint, seemingly idyllic town of Hollow Creek, Massachusetts. The school itself is a low, brick building, built in the 1950s, and expanded upon haphazardly over the years. The interior is a maze of linoleum hallways, brightly colored bulletin boards displaying student artwork, and the ever-present aroma of floor wax and mystery meat from the cafeteria.

Dr. Finch's office is a small, rectangular space tucked away in a quiet corner of the school, next to the nurse's office. It's a haven of organized chaos: overflowing bookshelves filled with textbooks on child psychology and picture books about feelings, a comfortable (if slightly threadbare) armchair, a small table for art therapy sessions, and a desk buried under paperwork, art supplies, and a collection of stress balls shaped like various farm animals. The walls are decorated with student drawings, posters promoting mental health awareness, and a framed diploma from Boston College. The most prominent feature is a large window overlooking the school's playground, currently a deserted, rain-soaked expanse of swings and slides.
