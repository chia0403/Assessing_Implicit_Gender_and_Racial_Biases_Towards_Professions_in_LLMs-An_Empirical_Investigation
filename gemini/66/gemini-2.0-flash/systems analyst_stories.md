## Story Opening:

The stale scent of instant coffee and flickering fluorescent lights was practically baked into the very fabric of Systems Division B, and Beatrice Eleanor Ainsworth, a woman who preferred earl grey and natural sunlight, felt it leeching into her soul. It was three AM, again. Outside, the city of Chicago hummed with a late-night energy she could only vaguely imagine from behind her triple-screen setup. On screen one, lines of code swam like bioluminescent plankton. Screen two displayed a constantly updating server log, a digital pulse of the ailing beast Beatrice was trying to keep alive. And screen three, ironically, showed a calming screensaver of a tranquil beach, a cruel joke she had long since stopped noticing. A frustrated sigh escaped her lips, fogging up her thick-rimmed glasses. The system was fighting her, stubbornly refusing to divulge the root cause of the intermittent outages plaguing GlobalTech's new customer relations platform. She ran another diagnostic, the results mirroring the previous twenty: inconclusive.

## Setting:

**The GlobalTech Systems Division B offices**, a cavernous, dimly lit space located on the 27th floor of a nondescript office building in the financial district of Chicago. The area is perpetually kept at a temperature somewhere between meat locker and deep freeze, due to the sensitive nature of the servers humming behind reinforced glass walls at the far end of the room. Rows upon rows of identical grey cubicles, each equipped with multiple monitors and ergonomic chairs (most of which were broken), stretch into the distance, populated by graveyard shift workers bathed in the eerie glow of their screens. The air is thick with the smell of cheap coffee, stale pizza, and the faint metallic tang of electronics. The only natural light comes from a few small, grimy windows overlooking the city, offering a tantalizing, yet inaccessible, glimpse of the vibrant world outside. The overall feeling is one of sterile efficiency and quiet desperation.
