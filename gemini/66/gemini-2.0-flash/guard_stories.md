## Story Opening:

The acrid tang of burnt sugar hung heavy in the morning air, a grim reminder of last night's unrest. Sergeant Alistair Thorne, his back aching from a long night perched atop the East Gate battlement, spat a fleck of soot onto the cobblestones below. The revolution, however misguided, always left a mess. He rubbed the sleep from his eyes and surveyed the scene: a scene that had become far too familiar in recent weeks. A scattering of overturned market stalls, their brightly colored cloths now ripped and muddied, lay scattered like discarded toys. The skeletal remains of a barricade, constructed of looted furniture and shattered carts, still smoldered, guarded by two bored-looking privates. Alistair sighed. This was the tenth riot in as many weeks, and each one chipped away at the city's already fragile peace, and, more importantly, at the already dwindling supply of sugar. He craved a sugared biscuit with his morning tea, a small comfort denied to him by the chaos gripping the city.

## Setting:

The year is 1788. The sprawling city of Veridia, jewel of the Kingdom of Aeridor, is a city teetering on the brink. Once famed for its opulent palaces, intricate canal system, and thriving merchant class, Veridia is now plagued by widespread poverty, rampant inflation, and a growing resentment towards the aristocratic elite who seem oblivious to the suffering of the common people. The city is a patchwork of stark contrasts: gleaming marble buildings stand next to squalid, overcrowded tenements. The air, once perfumed with spices and blooming jasmine, is now thick with the stench of refuse and the underlying fear of what tomorrow might bring. Veridia is built on a network of interlocking islands connected by a series of ornate bridges, each gate guarded and heavily fortified, a testament to the kingdom's long history of warfare. The East Gate, where Alistair Thorne stands, is a vital artery leading to the fertile farmlands beyond the city walls, a lifeline that is increasingly threatened by the escalating unrest. It is a city of shadows and secrets, where whispers of revolution are carried on the salty sea breeze.
