They were meant to evoke a sense of calm, a touch of earthy tranquility amidst the high-gloss perfection of her salon. But even the tiny, fleshy leaves seemed to droop under the oppressive weight of the storm, mirroring her own subdued mood. Today wasn't just any Tuesday; today was *the* Tuesday. Eleanor Vance, notoriously difficult socialite and arbiter of Boston's elite, was scheduled for a cut and color. And Izzy knew, with a chilling certainty that ran deeper than the roots of Mrs. Vance's platinum blonde, that this appointment could either make or break her career.
