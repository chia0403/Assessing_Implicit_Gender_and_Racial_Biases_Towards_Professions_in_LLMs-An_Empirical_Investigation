The stale, burnt-coffee smell clung to Detective Isabella “Izzy” Rossi like a second skin. It permeated her hair, her clothes, even seemed to seep into the pores of her skin. It was the smell of the 3rd Precinct, the aroma of late nights, bad leads, and the constant, low-level hum of desperation that permeated every corner of the building.

The setting was not glamorous. Forget the sleek, modern architecture of cop shows. The 3rd, located on the gritty fringes of Camden, New Jersey, was a monument to bureaucratic neglect. The brick exterior was stained with years of grime and graffiti, the windows perpetually smudged. Inside, the fluorescent lights flickered erratically, casting long, ominous shadows across the linoleum floor. Filing cabinets, overflowing with manila folders crammed with unanswered questions and forgotten promises, lined the walls. The air conditioning unit, a relic from a bygone era, wheezed and sputtered more than it cooled.

Izzy sat hunched over her desk, a cracked ceramic mug warming her hands. The screen of her ancient desktop computer glowed dimly, illuminating her tired face. Rain lashed against the windowpane, mirroring the relentless drumming of anxiety in her chest. On the blotter in front of her lay a single, faded photograph - a young woman with bright eyes and a hopeful smile, lost now to the dark streets of Camden. This one, the missing girl, Sarah Miller, was hitting Izzy harder than most. She reminded Izzy too much of herself, of a life she almost had. The case was cold, nearly a year old, but Izzy refused to let it go.
