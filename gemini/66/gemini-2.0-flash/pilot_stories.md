The sun beat down on the corrugated iron roof of the hangar, turning the air inside into a shimmering haze. Amelia Jane Hartigan wiped a bead of sweat from her brow with the back of her oil-stained glove. The smell of aviation fuel, hot metal, and the faint tang of the salty air from the nearby Pacific clung to everything, a familiar and comforting scent that grounded her even when she was thousands of feet in the air. This was her sanctuary, her kingdom.

Amelia's kingdom was a dusty, forgotten corner of the Coronado Naval Air Station in San Diego, 1943. Wartime had transformed the usually sleepy base into a hive of activity, a constant hum of engines and hurried voices. Amelia, however, carved out her own quiet space within the chaos. Her hangar, Number 7, housed her pride and joy: a Grumman F4F Wildcat fighter, nicknamed "Rosie" after Amelia's fiery grandmother. Rosie wasn't new, not by a long shot. She bore the scars of countless training flights and simulated dogfights, but Amelia knew her inside and out. Every rivet, every wire, every gauge felt as familiar as the lines on her own palm. Today, Rosie needed a little extra attention; a temperamental magneto had been acting up during Amelia's last test run. As the world churned around her, filled with the dread and urgency of war, Amelia found solace in the meticulous act of keeping Rosie in the sky. Her kingdom, and her responsibility.
