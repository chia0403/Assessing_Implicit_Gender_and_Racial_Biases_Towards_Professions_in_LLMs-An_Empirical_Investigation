The chipped ceramic mug warmed Amelia "Amy" Beatrice Finch’s hands as she stared out the grimy window of "Worldly Wanderlust," her humble travel agency nestled in the less-than-glamorous district of Little Puddlebrook, Ohio. The incessant drizzle pattered against the glass, a dreary counterpoint to the vibrant posters adorning the walls. Lush rainforests of Costa Rica, sun-drenched beaches of Bali, and snow-capped peaks of the Himalayas – all images carefully curated to ignite a wanderlust in a town where the most exotic trip anyone took was to the slightly larger town of Big Puddlebrook, thirty miles west.

Little Puddlebrook, frankly, smelled perpetually of damp earth and regret. Its claim to fame was, ironically, the defunct "Puddlebrook Rubber Duck Factory," now a crumbling eyesore on the edge of town. Amy, at 32, felt a pang of kinship with the abandoned factory. Once upon a time, she’d dreamed of escaping this place, of seeing the world she now sold to others. But life, as it often did, had thrown her a curveball in the form of her ailing grandmother and a hefty inheritance – not enough to actually travel the world, but just enough to buy this little shop and be perpetually tethered to it.
