## Story Opening

The fluorescent lights of "Tax Time Triumph" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the daily grind for Bartholomew "Bart" Finch. He stared out the smeared window, watching a flurry of late-afternoon snow swirl around the neon sign proclaiming "Accuracy Guaranteed!" Accuracy was Bart's mantra, his religion. Heâ€™d once spent three hours dissecting the proper deduction for charitable donations, only to discover the client had forgotten to sign the receipt. Accuracy, it seemed, was a lonely path paved with discarded W-2s and the lingering scent of cheap coffee.

He took another sip of the tepid brew, the taste doing little to dispel the gray fog that clung to him like a poorly filled out Schedule A. February was the worst. The sweet spot between the post-holiday slump and the frantic rush of April 15th. A time of quiet desperation, punctuated by the occasional desperate soul clinging to the hope of a refund to escape some personal financial abyss.

Tonight, the abyss seemed closer than ever.

## Setting

The story is primarily set in **"Tax Time Triumph," a small, independent income tax preparation office located in the slightly-down-at-heel neighborhood of Oakhaven, on the outskirts of Duluth, Minnesota.** The office itself is a study in functional blandness. Think beige walls, faux wood paneling, and a perpetually flickering overhead light fixture.

The main room consists of four cubicles, each equipped with a computer running outdated tax software and a stack of forms that threaten to topple over at any moment. A perpetually overflowing shredder sits in the corner, a monument to the paper trail of modern life.

Behind the main room is a small, cramped office belonging to the owner, a man named Mr. Henderson, whose booming voice often carries over the thin walls. Bart's cubicle is the furthest from the door, offering him a modicum of privacy, but also making him the target of the occasional errant stapler or misplaced tax return. Outside, Oakhaven is a neighborhood of modest houses, struggling businesses, and a general air of economic hardship. The snow-swept streets and the long Minnesota winters only amplify the sense of quiet desperation that permeates the area, and by extension, "Tax Time Triumph."
