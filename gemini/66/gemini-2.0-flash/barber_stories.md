The chipped porcelain sink, stained eternally with the ghosts of shaving cream and hair dye, gurgled like a discontented sea monster as Walter Archibald Humphrey rinsed the lather from another satisfied customer. Sunlight, thick and dusty, poured through the grime-streaked windows of Humphrey & Son Barbershop, illuminating the motes dancing in the air like tiny, golden acrobats. The bell above the door, a relic from Walter's grandfather's day, jangled a merry tune, a stark contrast to the heavy scent of bay rum, stale tobacco, and the phantom scent of the Great Depression that still clung to the building like a tenacious vine.

Humphrey & Son Barbershop was a fixture in the small, forgotten town of Dustbowl, Kansas, a place where tumbleweeds outnumbered residents three to one and the only excitement came from the occasional stray dog chasing its tail down Main Street. The shop itself was a time capsule, stubbornly refusing to acknowledge the changing world outside. The walls were lined with yellowed photographs of generations of Humphrey men, each wielding a straight razor with the same steely-eyed precision. A faded advertisement for Lucky Strike cigarettes hung crookedly above the waiting chairs, its promise of pure enjoyment now tinged with a bittersweet irony. The worn leather of the barber chairs, meticulously maintained by Walter over the years, held the imprints of countless backs, each a silent witness to the joys, sorrows, and gossip of Dustbowl. This place, this dusty, unchanging sanctuary, was Walter's life.
