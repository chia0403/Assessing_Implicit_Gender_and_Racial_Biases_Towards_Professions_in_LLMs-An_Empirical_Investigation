## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The year is 1957. The sun, a pale apricot through the grime-streaked windows, did little to brighten the cavernous office of Harrington & Sons, a prestigious law firm in downtown Chicago. The air hung thick with the smell of stale coffee, musty law books, and the unspoken anxiety that perpetually permeated the place. Rows of towering desks, each a miniature fortress cluttered with overflowing in-trays and half-empty ashtrays, stretched out like regiments on a battlefield. The constant clatter of typewriters, punctuated by the shrill ring of telephones, formed a relentless soundtrack to the workday.

**Opening:**

Dorothy Mae Parker, her pearl necklace glinting in the weak sunlight, smoothed the fabric of her navy blue pencil skirt. At precisely 8:57 AM, three minutes before Mr. Harrington was due to arrive, she perched on her ergonomic, yet still uncomfortable, chair. It wasn't just a matter of punctuality; it was a declaration of control. In this sea of ambition and egos, Dorothy needed every small victory she could muster. She straightened the stack of legal documents on her desk, each meticulously filed and indexed, a testament to her unwavering precision. The faint scent of lavender, her signature perfume, hung in the air, a subtle rebellion against the masculine musk that dominated the office. Today, however, even Dorothy's meticulously crafted routine couldn't quite quell the unease that had been gnawing at her all week. Mr. Harrington had been acting strangely - unusually silent, dismissive even. And the rumors swirling through the secretarial pool were anything but comforting. Something was brewing at Harrington & Sons, and Dorothy Mae Parker had a feeling it was about to boil over.
