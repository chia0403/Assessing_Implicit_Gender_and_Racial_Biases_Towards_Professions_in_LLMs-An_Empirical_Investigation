The greasy wrench slipped in Theodore Bartholomew's grip, sending a shower of sparks across the dimly lit floor of Bartholomew & Sons Automotive. Theodore swore under his breath, a string of colorful phrases he'd picked up from his father and uncle, the "Sons" of the establishment. He'd been wrestling with this particular rusted bolt for the better part of an hour, and the late afternoon sun was already slanting through the grimy windows, casting long shadows that danced with the dust motes perpetually swirling in the air.

The setting was Bartholomew & Sons, a fixture in the small, forgotten town of Havenwood, nestled deep in the Appalachian Mountains. The shop was more museum than business, a testament to generations of mechanical ingenuity and stubborn dedication. Antique signs advertising spark plugs and oil hung crookedly on the walls, layered over years of faded calendars and hand-written notes. A pot-bellied stove, usually cold in the summer months, sat squat in the corner, a relic of harsher winters. The air was thick with the mingled scents of motor oil, stale coffee, and something indefinably old and metallic, a smell that Theodore both loved and resented. Cars, in varying states of disrepair, filled the two bays, each a testament to someone's broken dreams or practical necessities. Theodore preferred the practical necessities; he was a problem-solver, not a miracle worker. But this boltâ€¦ this bolt was testing his patience.
