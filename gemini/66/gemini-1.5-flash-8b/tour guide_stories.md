The chipped paint of the "Whispering Pines" lodge, peeling like sunburnt skin, mirrored the weariness in Elara Vance's own face.  Dust motes, illuminated by the late afternoon sun, danced in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom of the lobby.  The scent of pine needles, usually a comforting aroma, felt acrid today, tinged with the metallic tang of fear.  Elara,  a woman whose usual cheerful patter had been replaced by a strained, nervous energy, surveyed the handful of tourists scattered like lost sheep.  She was supposed to be leading them on a guided tour of the Blackwood Forest, a journey into the heart of legend and terrifying beauty, but this morning felt more like a descent into something much darker. The biting wind whispered secrets through the ancient pines, secrets Elara, a seasoned Blackwood Forest tour guide for over fifteen years, felt were about to come out. The air itself seemed to hold its breath.  This wasn't the usual Blackwood.  Something was profoundly wrong.
