The biting wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vance's coat around her legs as she squinted at the skeletal remains of a deer, its antlers gnarled and broken against a backdrop of bruised purple sky.  The air, thick with the scent of pine needles and something faintly metallic, hung heavy in the valley, a stark contrast to the crisp, clean aroma of antiseptic she usually associated with her clinic.  It was early October, and the leaves, once vibrant shades of emerald and gold, were now a crumpled mess scattered across the frozen ground.  The remote veterinary clinic, nestled amongst the towering pines of the Whisperwind Mountains, was more a testament to her dedication than a comfortable haven.

This was her tenth year, or perhaps her tenth *season*, operating the sprawling, rustic practice. The clinic, once a quaint cabin, had expanded over the years, fueled by her relentless, almost obsessive, drive to care for the creatures of this wild, unforgiving region.  The surrounding mountains, silent witnesses to her tireless work, held their breath, as if waiting for the next call that would summon her into their shadowed depths.  The deep, echoing hollows of the valley echoed with the mournful cries of unseen creatures, a symphony of the wilderness that both intimidated and inspired her.  The small, isolated town of Oakhaven, a mere collection of weathered buildings clinging to the mountainside, offered little in the way of companionship or respite.  Dr. Vance was, in a very real sense, a solitary sentinel on the frontier of the forest, a guardian angel for the creatures of the wilderness, a silent, solitary echo in the vast and lonely world around her.
