The chipped paint of the kindergarten classroom walls, a faded, sickly yellow, seemed to swallow the last rays of the afternoon sun.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom, highlighting the colourful drawings plastered haphazardly across the walls â€“ a dragon with seven heads, a sun with smiling eyes, a rainbow that stretched impossibly to the sky.  Amelia Grace Butterfield, a fourth-year elementary school teacher, stood at the chalkboard, a single piece of chalk in her hand, the eraser a dusty grey smear.  The air was thick with the lingering scent of crayons and forgotten dreams.  Outside, the rhythmic chirping of crickets heralded the approach of a long, hazy summer night.  Amelia, however, was far from peaceful. A single, misplaced, and slightly-too-brightly-coloured drawing, a vibrant depiction of a monster-eating-a-pizza, seemed to mock her.  Her head throbbed, a dull ache that mirrored the growing frustration in her chest.  She had a feeling this day, like the last several, was going to linger.
