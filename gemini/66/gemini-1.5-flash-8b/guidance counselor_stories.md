Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the Southside High Guidance Center, a relentless drumming that mirrored the anxieties swirling within Amelia Hawthorne, guidance counselor extraordinaire.  The fluorescent lights flickered, casting long, dancing shadows across the worn beige linoleum floor.  Empty student chairs, each bearing the faint imprint of recent occupants, lined the walls.  A chipped mug of lukewarm coffee sat on Amelia's cluttered desk, a testament to the late-night hours sheâ€™d spent navigating the labyrinthine paths of teenage aspirations and fears.  Outside, the grey sky mirrored the oppressive weight of the impending winter, a season that seemed to compound the gloom of this forgotten corner of the city.  Amelia, a woman weathered by years of navigating the emotional storms of adolescence, sighed. Another Tuesday night, another round of whispered anxieties and unspoken hopes.  She knew, with a chilling certainty, that tonight's session was going to be particularly challenging.
