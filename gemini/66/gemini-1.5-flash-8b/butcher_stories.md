The scent of blood, sharp and metallic, clung to Bartholomew "Barty" Grimshaw like a second skin.  It wasn't the cloying, sickly sweetness of decay, but the clean, vibrant tang of freshly-fallen life, a life now transformed into sustenance.  Barty, a butcher of impeccable reputation in the cobbled alleys of  Greyhaven, was meticulously trimming the last vestiges of sinew from a hefty ox rump, his knife a blur of practiced precision against the glistening mahogany slab.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight that pierced the gloom of his small, cramped shop, illuminating the glistening, crimson droplets clinging to the butcher block.  Greyhaven itself was a labyrinth of narrow, winding streets, its buildings a patchwork of weathered timber and crumbling stone, their surfaces whispering tales of generations past.  The constant murmur of the city – the clinking of carts, the distant cries of hawkers, the rhythmic thud of hammers – formed a low, hypnotic hum that seemed to pulse in time with the rhythm of Barty's own movements.  He was a man forged in the crucible of this city, his hands, calloused and strong, having absorbed the very essence of Greyhaven's daily cycle, from the dawn's first light to the city's final, sighing breath.
