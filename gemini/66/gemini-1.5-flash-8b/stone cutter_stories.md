The biting wind, a relentless sculptor itself, whipped across the exposed outcrop of grey granite.  Dust, fine and gritty, stung Elara Stonehand's eyes as she chipped away at the stubborn rock face.  Sunrise, a pale, hesitant blush across the eastern sky, cast long, skeletal shadows that danced with the swirling motes of stone dust.  Her village, nestled deep within the craggy valleys of the Whisperwind Mountains, was a symphony of muted sounds â€“ the rhythmic thud of hammer against stone, the soft murmur of the glacial river flowing below, the distant bleating of sheep. This was Elara's world, a world sculpted by the relentless forces of nature and honed by the skill of generations of stone cutters.  Her hands, calloused and strong, were the instruments of her existence, her livelihood, her connection to the mountain itself.  Elara Stonehand, she was known throughout the valleys. Not just for her precision with the chisel, but for the whispers that followed her name: a whisper of legends, a whisper of stories locked within the stones themselves.
