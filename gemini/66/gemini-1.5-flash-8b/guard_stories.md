The biting wind whipped across the cobblestones of the Old Quarter, carrying with it the scent of brine and something vaguely metallic, like old blood.  Rain, a relentless curtain, plastered Elara Oakhaven's threadbare cloak to her frame.  From her vantage point atop the ramparts of the Greywatch Citadel, she could see the flickering lanterns of the port city, clinging precariously to the encroaching darkness.  The city, usually a symphony of life and commerce, now felt as hushed as a tomb.  Elara, a seasoned guard of the Citadel, known throughout the city for her unwavering vigilance and sharp wit, felt a prickle of unease. This stillness was unnatural.  The usual chatter of merchants, the cries of children, the rhythmic clanging of smiths' hammers â€“ all were silent, replaced by a chilling emptiness that seeped into the very air.  Tonight, something felt different, something wrong.  Her worn leather gloves, hardened by countless patrols and countless nights just like this one, tightened around her hands. Tonight, the city held its breath, waiting.
