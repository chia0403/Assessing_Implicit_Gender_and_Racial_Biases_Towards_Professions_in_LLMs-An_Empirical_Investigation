The biting wind whipped Amelia Hawthorne's camera bag against her back, each gust a tiny, insistent jab.  She squinted against the relentless grey of the Northumberland coast, the waves crashing on the jagged rocks below a sky the colour of bruised plums.  Salt spray stung her cheeks, stinging her eyes despite the thick layers of waterproof fabric.  Amelia, a freelance photographer known for her evocative portraits of the rugged British landscape, felt a familiar shiver – not of cold, but of anticipation.  She was here, at the desolate, windswept headland of Craggy Point, for something she couldn't quite name.  A feeling, not a subject.

The village of Bamburgh, a cluster of weathered stone houses clinging to the hillside above, barely registered against the vast, encompassing grey.  The sea, a relentless, untamed force, was the only true master here.  Every crevice of the rock face, every frothing wave, every gnarled branch of the ancient trees that clung precariously to the cliff edge, was a testament to the relentless power of nature.  This was her kingdom, this landscape of stark beauty and brutal honesty.  It was also, she suspected, the place where her story – and maybe, just maybe, her next breakthrough image – would finally begin.
