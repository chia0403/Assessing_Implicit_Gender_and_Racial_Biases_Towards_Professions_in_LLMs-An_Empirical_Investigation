The air in the drafting room hung thick with the smell of stale coffee and the faint, metallic tang of graphite.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom of the high windows, illuminating the intricate network of lines and curves etched onto the drafting table before Amelia "Amy" Cartwright.  Amy, a drafting worker for the sprawling, century-old architectural firm of Blackwood & Sons, traced a delicate line with a pencil, the faint scratching sound a metronome counting down the seconds until the next deadline.

The firm's headquarters, nestled in the heart of the grey, industrial district of Ashcroft, boasted a history as rich and layered as the city itself.  Towering brick buildings, their facades adorned with faded signage and chipped paint, surrounded the imposing, five-story structure.  Inside, the air, though thick with the scent of old paper and the whirring of antiquated machinery, held a quiet, almost reverent atmosphere.  Years of accumulated drafts, blueprints, and calculations had left an invisible patina on everything, each drawing a testament to the countless structures Blackwood & Sons had helped bring to life.  This particular project, a proposed expansion of the Ashcroft Canal District, was no different.  Pressure mounted, deadlines loomed, and Amy's fingers flew across the drafting board, the relentless rhythm of the work a counterpoint to the ticking clock.
