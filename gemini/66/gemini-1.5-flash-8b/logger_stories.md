The biting wind whipped at Elias Blackwood's weathered face, stinging his eyes with icy particles.  He hunched deeper into his worn leather jacket, the scent of pine needles and damp earth a meager comfort against the encroaching chill.  The sun, a pale disc barely clinging to the horizon, cast long, skeletal shadows across the vast, snow-dusted expanse of the Cascade Mountains.  Elias, a logger known throughout the unforgiving wilderness of the Pacific Northwest for his strength and unwavering resolve, stood at the precipice of a formidable, centuries-old fir, its massive trunk a stark sentinel against the looming twilight.

The year was 1928.  Snow-laden boughs, like frosted fingers, reached out from the ancient trees, forming a cathedral of frozen air above the remote logging camp nestled deep within the towering forests of Washington State.  Elias's weathered hands, calloused and scarred from years of wrestling with the raw, untamed wood, trembled slightly as he scanned the encroaching gloom.  He wasn't afraid of the dark, but the silence that followed the sun's descent held a different kind of weight.  A weight that pressed upon his soul, whispering tales of the wild and the unknown.  The camp, huddled amongst the towering pines, was a fleeting beacon against the vast and overwhelming solitude.  The only sounds were the rhythmic creak of the wind through the branches and the occasional snap of a twig under his boots.  The scent of pine, once a familiar comfort, now seemed heavier, almost oppressive. This particular forest held a secret, a secret Elias sensed was about to be revealed.
