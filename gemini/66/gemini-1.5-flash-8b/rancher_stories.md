The wind, a relentless, whispering beast, whipped dust devils across the parched plains of the Montana Badlands.  A lone figure,  Elias Thorne, weathered and lean as a juniper tree, watched the storm from atop his weathered porch.  The ranch, "Thorne's Ridge," a sprawling but sparsely populated expanse of land marked by jagged buttes and scrubby pines, offered little respite from the relentless sun.  Elias, with his weathered hands calloused from years of coaxing a living from the unforgiving land, surveyed the desolate horizon.  The drought, relentless and brutal, had withered the already meagre crops, leaving the land looking like a skeletal skeleton.  His cattle, his livelihood, were rapidly losing weight.  He squinted, his eyes tracing the lines of the diminishing waterholes, each a fragile, precious oasis in the vast emptiness.  The air, thick with the metallic tang of fear and desperation, hung heavy in the stillness between the gusts of wind. A single, piercing cry of a hawk sliced through the silence.
