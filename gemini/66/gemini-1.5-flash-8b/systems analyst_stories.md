The flickering fluorescent lights of the late-night server room hummed, a relentless soundtrack to Elara Nightingale's existence.  Rows of humming server racks, like silent, metallic giants, stretched into the darkness, their glowing LEDs painting ethereal patterns on the walls.  Dust motes danced in the weak beams of the overhead lights, swirling like tiny, spectral confetti.  Elara, a systems analyst for GlobalCorp, hunched over a keyboard, her fingers flying across the keys in a rapid, almost frantic, rhythm.  The air, thick with the smell of burnt coffee and recycled air, clung to her like a second skin.  It was 3:17 AM, and the city outside was sound asleep, oblivious to the digital battle raging within the heart of GlobalCorp's data network.
