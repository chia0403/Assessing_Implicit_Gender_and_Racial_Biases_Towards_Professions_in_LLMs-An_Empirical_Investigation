The biting wind whipped around Elara Nightingale, a sculptor's chill against her architect's soul.  Dust devils danced across the cracked, sun-baked earth of the Mesa Verde, swirling fragments of ochre and sandstone into the already hazy air.  High above, the jagged peaks of the San Juan Mountains, sharp and unforgiving, pierced the bruised cerulean sky.  Elara Nightingale, her name etched into the worn leather of her sketching pad, stared at the crumbling ruins before her.  The ancient city, a symphony of eroded stone whispers, lay sprawled beneath a harsh sun, a silent testament to a forgotten civilization.  This was not the sleek, polished concrete of her meticulously planned skyscrapers; this was something else, something…ancient.  Something demanding.

This wasn't a client's brief, nor a project outlined in crisp, architectural drawings.  This was a pilgrimage, driven by a nagging sense of unease, a feeling she couldn't quite define, yet knew to be powerful.  Her assignment, ostensibly a cultural preservation project for the local historical society, was a flimsy excuse.  The real reason, the unspoken truth she carried within her, was far more compelling, far more…unsettling.
