The biting wind, a relentless, icy claw, clawed at Elara Oakhaven's face as she surveyed her shivering wheat fields.  Winterâ€™s grip tightened around the valley of Oakhaven, a harsh beauty of frosted earth and skeletal branches clawing at the grey sky.  Snow, the consistency of powdered glass, coated everything in a suffocating silence.  Elara, her face etched with the lines of a life spent wrestling with the capricious nature of the land, pulled her worn wool shawl tighter.  It offered little solace against the encroaching cold, but it was all she had.

Elara Oakhaven, a woman of forty-two with eyes the colour of the winter sky, knew this was not an ordinary winter.  It was a harbinger.  The whispers had started in the taverns of Oakhaven village, murmurs of a coming famine, of a cruel season that would steal more than just warmth.  Her heart, heavy with the weight of her responsibilities, thudded against her ribs, a frantic drumbeat in the silence.  Her livelihood, the very sustenance of her family, depended on the harvest to come. And this year, the harvest seemed to be mocking her.
