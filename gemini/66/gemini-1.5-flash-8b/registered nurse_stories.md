The fluorescent hum of the emergency room thrummed through Amelia Rodriguez, a registered nurse with ten years of experience,  but tonight it felt different.  A different kind of oppressive, a low-level, unsettling rumble that vibrated in her bones rather than her ears.  The air, usually thick with the antiseptic smell of bleach and the metallic tang of blood, was strangely still, almost breathless.  Outside, the city roared, a frantic symphony of car horns and distant sirens, yet inside the emergency room, a silence, heavy and expectant, hung like a shroud.  

Amelia, her uniform crisp and starched, stood at the foot of a gurney, her gaze fixed on the young man lying prone.  His nametag read "Ethan Davis," a name that wouldn't stay etched in her memory quite so quickly as others.  Ethan was pale, his chest rising and falling in shallow gasps, his eyes closed tight.  Around them, the other nurses and doctors moved with practiced efficiency, their voices a muffled chorus of directives. Amelia, though, felt an unsettling sense of disconnect.  It wasn't the usual tension of a busy night shift, but something darker, something… different.  This was more than just a patient; this was a puzzle, and she was the only one noticing the pieces that didn't quite fit.


The Emergency Room of St. Jude's Hospital, a sprawling, slightly outdated facility in the heart of the city's bustling Lower East Side, pulsed with a frenetic energy.  Rows of examination rooms, each bathed in sterile white light, stretched into the night.  The air conditioning, surprisingly, was on full blast.  Despite the cacophony of the city outside, the room felt unusually isolated, the stark contrast between the frantic exterior and the seemingly contained interior highlighting the tension in the air.  A faint but distinct metallic tang filled the space, not just of blood, but of something else—something sharper, something undeniably unnatural.
