The biting November wind, a relentless sculptor of the already skeletal oak trees, whipped at Elias Thorne's worn tweed jacket.  He shivered, not just from the cold, but from the sheer, oppressive weight of the day.  The sprawling estate of Blackwood Manor, normally a serene tapestry of emerald lawns and sculpted hedges, felt almost hostile under the encroaching twilight.  A skeletal branch, snatched from the frost-bitten boughs of a centuries-old beech, lay splintered at his feet, a stark reminder of winter’s relentless grip. Elias, groundskeeper of Blackwood Manor for the past twenty years, felt a familiar pang of melancholy.  The place, once a vibrant symphony of life, now echoed with the whisper of impending silence.  He knew this particular quiet wasn't the usual seasonal calm; it felt…empty.  It felt ominous.
