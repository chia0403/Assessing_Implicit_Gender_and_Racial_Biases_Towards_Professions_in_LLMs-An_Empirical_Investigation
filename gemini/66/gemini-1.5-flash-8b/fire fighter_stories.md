The biting wind howled a mournful dirge against the corrugated iron walls of the dilapidated warehouse, a symphony of whistling metal and groaning timbers that seemed to echo the frantic rhythm of Amelia Blackwood's heart.  The air, already thick with the acrid tang of smoke, was choked with a fine, stinging dust that coated everything in a grey haze.  Amelia, Firefighter Amelia Blackwood, stared into the maw of the inferno.  Flames, the colour of molten gold and angry orange, danced and writhed within the gaping hole in the roof, licking at the skeletal remains of what was once a bustling distribution centre.  The fire, a hungry beast, roared with a deafening ferocity.

**Setting:**  The forgotten industrial district of Havenwood, a city built on the forgotten promise of prosperity.  Weathered brick buildings, scarred with time and neglect, huddled together, their windows like empty eyes staring out at a world that had moved on.  Rusty fences and crumbling walls lined the narrow, poorly maintained streets.  This particular warehouse, a monument to abandoned dreams, had stood silent and forlorn for years, a vacant shell in a city that refused to forget it.  The faint aroma of stale beer and forgotten memories lingered in the air alongside the burning timber.
