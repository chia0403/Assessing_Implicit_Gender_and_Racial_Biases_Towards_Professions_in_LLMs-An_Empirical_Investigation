The chipped Formica countertop gleamed under the harsh fluorescent lights of the "Numbers & Nonsense" accounting office.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grimy window, illuminating a meticulously organized mountain of receipts, invoices, and tax forms.  Amelia Beatrice Thistlewick, her fingers stained a familiar shade of graphite, painstakingly tallied the figures on a ledger, her brow furrowed in concentration.  The rhythmic click-clack of her ballpoint pen against the paper was the only sound in the otherwise silent office, punctuated occasionally by the distant hum of the city outside.

Amelia, thirty-two years old, possessed a quiet intensity, her eyes, a startling shade of emerald green, darting between the figures and the perpetually overflowing coffee mug on her desk.  The worn leather of her worn-but-well-loved vintage bookkeeper's chair pressed gently against her back, a familiar comfort in this cramped, slightly musty space.  She worked within a small, but vibrant, community in the bustling, yet somehow surprisingly quiet, district of the Lower East Side in New York City. The scent of roasting coffee beans, subtly mingling with the faint aroma of old paper, was a daily ritual, a comforting presence in the otherwise relentless pursuit of accuracy.
