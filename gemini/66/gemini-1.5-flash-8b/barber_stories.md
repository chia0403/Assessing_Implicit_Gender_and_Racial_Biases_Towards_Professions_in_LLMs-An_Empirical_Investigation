The clatter of clippers, a rhythmic tattoo against the chipped porcelain sink, punctuated the hushed morning in Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's barbershop, "The Snip-Snap."  Sunlight, filtered through the dusty, floral-patterned drapes, painted the tiny shop in a warm, honeyed light.  A single, flickering bare bulb hung precariously from the ceiling, casting long, dancing shadows on the worn wooden floor.  The air hung thick with the scent of lavender-scented shaving cream and stale coffee, a familiar aroma that clung to Barty like the faded floral wallpaper of the shop.  He was a man of routine, of precise lines and gentle hands, meticulously crafting sculpted fades and carefully trimmed beards. Today, however, the routine felt oddlyâ€¦off.  A persistent humming, barely audible above the whirring of the clippers, seemed to vibrate in the air, a counterpoint to the expected silence.  Outside, the city of Aethelgard, a sprawling metropolis built on ancient, forgotten foundations, bustled with its usual cacophony of horns and hurried footsteps, oblivious to the quiet, simmering unease within the walls of The Snip-Snap.
