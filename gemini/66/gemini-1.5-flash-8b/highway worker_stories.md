Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of ochre and gray, danced across the cracked asphalt of Highway 212, their swirling chaos mirroring the turmoil in his own heart.  Sunrise, a weak, pale blush against the towering Laramie Mountains, offered little solace.  He squinted, his gaze fixated on the shimmering mirage that seemed to stretch endlessly ahead.  The year was 1957.  This stretch of highway, a vital artery for the burgeoning oil boom, was his domain, a vast, lonely canvas for the slow, painstaking work of road maintenance.

It connected him to the world, yet it seemed to isolate him at the same time.  He was a cog in a vast machine, a nameless worker in a relentless, unforgiving landscape.  Each morning, dawn brought a fresh layer of responsibility; the same monotonous tasks of patching potholes, clearing debris, and maintaining the safety of the road.
