The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the polished parquet floor of the Blackwood Manor.  Dust motes, illuminated like tiny, spectral dancers, swirled in the air.  Agnes Blackwood, a woman whose hands, though lined with the stories of countless homes, still possessed a surprising dexterity, meticulously dusted the ornate grandfather clock.  Its mahogany face, a testament to a bygone era, echoed the hushed grandeur of the manor itself.  The air, thick with the scent of beeswax and aged parchment, hung heavy with unspoken secrets, each whispered in the rustle of silk gowns and the faintest sigh of the wind whistling through the creaking eaves.

The Blackwood Manor, a sprawling Victorian edifice perched atop a windswept hill overlooking the town of Ashbrook, was a monument to faded fortunes.  Once a beacon of opulence, its many rooms now whispered of a past filled with lavish parties and hushed conversations.  Empty rooms, draped in the eerie stillness of disuse, held the ghosts of laughter and tears.  Agnes, the sole resident besides the aloof and reclusive Lord Blackwood, moved through these chambers with a quiet competence, her presence a quiet counterpoint to the echoing emptiness.  Her task, however, was not merely to maintain the house; it was to maintain the fragile veneer of normalcy in a place steeped in sorrow and solitude.
