The scent of cinnamon and freshly baked bread hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Amelia Butterfield, but today, it felt oddly… suffocating.  Sunlight, usually a welcome warmth filtering through the tall windows of "The Golden Crust," cast long, ominous shadows across the bustling bakery.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon haze, swirling around the intricate patterns etched into the wooden counter where Amelia meticulously arranged her creations – delicate croissants, perfectly golden loaves, and fluffy pain au chocolat.  The shop, usually a symphony of chatter and the rhythmic clang of baking pans, was eerily quiet, save for the gentle whirring of the old, but reliable, oven in the back.

The setting was the small, cobbled street of Oakhaven, a quaint town nestled amongst the rolling hills of the whispering Alderwoods.  Every house seemed to know the secrets of the seasons, their colours echoing the changing hues of the surrounding landscape.  The Golden Crust, nestled between a blacksmith's forge and a flower shop bursting with summer blossoms, was a cornerstone of Oakhaven.  Its warm glow, and the tempting aromas emanating from within, beckoned passersby to step inside and taste a slice of simple happiness. However, today, a strange stillness hung over the town, the usual buzz of activity replaced by an unsettling quietude.  Amelia felt it too – a creeping unease that prickled her skin and settled like a stone in her stomach.
