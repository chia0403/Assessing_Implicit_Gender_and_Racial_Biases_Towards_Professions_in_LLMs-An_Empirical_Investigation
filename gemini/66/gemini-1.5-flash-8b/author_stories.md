The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Nightingale's hands, the faint scent of Earl Grey clinging to the steam.  Sunlight, filtered through the lace curtains of her tiny, attic-level study, painted the worn wooden desk in shifting patterns of gold and amethyst.  Dust motes danced in the beams, a silent ballet mirroring the chaotic thoughts swirling in Amelia's mind.  Her latest novel, *The Serpent's Embrace*, was due to the publisher in two weeks, and the final chapter remained stubbornly elusive.  It was a novel of stolen love and ancient prophecies, set in a forgotten valley nestled amongst the jagged peaks of the Silvan Range, a place Amelia had never visited but felt profoundly connected to.  The valley, with its whispering pines and echoing glens, was almost as real to her as the cobbled streets of her childhood home in the town of Oakhaven.
