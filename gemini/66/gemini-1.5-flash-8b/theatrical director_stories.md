The chipped paint of the "Grand Majestic Theatre" was a testament to its faded glory.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom of the empty auditorium, illuminating the faded velvet seats and the skeletal remains of a once-vibrant stage.  This was the domain of Isolde Nightingale, a theatrical director with a reputation as fiery as the stage lights she commanded, though now only the ghostly echo of applause hung heavy in the air.  Isolde, a woman whose eyes held the boundless passion of a thousand forgotten melodramas, paced the makeshift office, a small, cluttered room behind the stage.  Stacks of scripts, each with its own whisper of a story, cluttered every surface.  A half-eaten bowl of stale pretzels sat beside a chipped porcelain doll, a macabre reminder of a lost love and a dream deferred.  The air hung thick with the scent of old wood and forgotten memories.  Outside, the city pulsed with life, indifferent to the quiet desolation within.
