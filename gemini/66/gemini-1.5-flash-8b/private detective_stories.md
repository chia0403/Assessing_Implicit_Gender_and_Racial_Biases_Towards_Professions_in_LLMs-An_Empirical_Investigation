The flickering neon sign of the "Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked cobblestones of Alderbrook.  The air, thick with the smell of damp earth and frying onions, hung heavy around Amelia "Ash" Ashworth, Private Investigator.  Ash, a woman built like a sturdy oak, despite her perpetually weary expression, hunched deeper into the worn leather of her trench coat, the collar pulled high against the biting wind.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron awning above the alleyway, a relentless percussion echoing the frantic rhythm of her thoughts.

Alderbrook, a town clinging precariously to the side of a mist-shrouded mountain range, was a labyrinth of narrow, twisting streets and hidden courtyards.  Each building seemed to hold its breath, whispering secrets to the wind.  The town's charm, if it could be called that, lay in its forgotten grandeur. Once a prosperous silver mining town, Alderbrook now existed on the fringes of time, its past echoing in the crumbling facades and the haunted eyes of its inhabitants.  It was a town where the past clung to the present like a shroud, and where Ash, with her keen eye and unwavering resolve, was a necessary evil.
