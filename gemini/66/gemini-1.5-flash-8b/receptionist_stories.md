The fluorescent lights of the "Apex Solutions" reception area hummed, a constant, low thrum that vibrated through Amelia Petrova's weary bones.  She tapped a manicured fingernail against the chipped Formica of her desk, the rhythmic clicking a counterpoint to the insistent pings of the phone and the occasional, frustrated sighs emanating from the waiting room.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom of the otherwise sterile office.  The air, thick with the scent of stale coffee and unidentifiable office supplies, felt heavy, almost suffocating.  Amelia, 27, with her perpetually tired eyes and a cascade of dark auburn hair, sighed.  Another Monday.  Another barrage of frustrated clients and demanding executives.  This was her life, the buffer between the outside world and the labyrinthine halls of Apex Solutions, the seemingly impenetrable fortress of corporate ambition.  The waiting room, crammed with anxious faces and overflowing with discarded brochures and magazines, felt like a silent, collective groan.
