Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, a relentless percussion that mirrored the rhythm of Amelia Blackwood's thoughts.  The small, unassuming physiotherapy practice, tucked away on a quiet side street in the perpetually overcast town of Alderbrook, was usually a haven of quiet hums and the soft click-clack of orthotic adjustments. Today, however, it echoed with a tension thick enough to cut with a scalpel.  The air hung heavy with the scent of pine needles and damp earth, a familiar comfort that couldn't mask the growing unease in Amelia's chest.

The setting was a small, cluttered physiotherapy clinic.  Books on kinesiology and anatomy lined the shelves, their spines worn smooth from countless hours of study.  A few battered exercise mats lay haphazardly on the floor, a stark contrast to the gleaming, sterile equipment meticulously arranged around the treatment rooms.  The light, filtered through the grime-streaked windows, painted the room in a muted palette of greys and browns, a reflection of the dreary, perpetually damp atmosphere of Alderbrook.  A lone, flickering fluorescent light hung precariously above the reception desk, casting long, dancing shadows on the faces of the few patients who waited for their appointments.  The scent of antiseptic mingled with the earthy smell, a subtle but pervasive indicator of the town's connection to the surrounding forests and the inevitable, lingering dampness.
