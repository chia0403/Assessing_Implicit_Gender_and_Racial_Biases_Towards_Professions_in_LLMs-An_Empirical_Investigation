The fluorescent lights of the Southside Community High hummed, a monotonous drone that echoed the rhythmic thud of Amelia Hayes's own pulse.  Amelia, a school psychologist with a perpetually tired smile and eyes that held the weight of countless whispered anxieties, surveyed the chaotic cafeteria.  Empty trays littered tables like discarded bones, the air thick with the smell of stale pizza and simmering adolescent angst.  Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the sprawling, neglected playground, where a group of students huddled, their low voices barely audible over the low thrum of the city. Amelia adjusted her worn leather satchel, the familiar weight a comforting ballast in this often turbulent landscape.  Her office, tucked away on the second floor, offered little respite. It was a small, pale-yellow room, smelling faintly of old paper and the antiseptic of desperation.  Today, however, it felt particularly charged.  A student had walked into her office, their eyes filled with a depth that no fifteen-year-old should hold.

**Setting:** Southside Community High School, a large, somewhat dilapidated public high school in a working-class neighborhood of a sprawling American city.
