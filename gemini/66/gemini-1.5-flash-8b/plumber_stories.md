The flickering neon sign of "The Leaky Faucet" cast a sickly yellow glow on Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, Jr., as he wrestled with a stubborn pipe.  Water, a relentless, insistent force, hammered against the porcelain basin, a counterpoint to the insistent buzzing of the drill bit he gripped.  Barty, a plumber of unyielding patience and surprising strength (though his biceps were more testament to years of battling corroded pipes than any gym regimen), swore under his breath, a sound lost to the rising chorus of dripping pipes and the distant wail of a siren.

The cramped, humid basement apartment, smelling faintly of mildew and something akin to burnt sugar, was Barty's current battleground.  It wasn't a glamorous work environment, but it was familiar, a space that held the echoes of countless previous plumbing catastrophes, each one painstakingly repaired.  Cobwebs draped like spectral shrouds from dusty corners, and the air hung thick with the humid aroma of stale beer and the faint, metallic tang of copper.  A faded photograph, tucked beneath a stack of rusty pipes, depicted a younger Barty, a beaming boy with a toothy grin and a gleaming, brand-new tool belt.  The stark contrast between the past and the present, the hopeful past and the relentless present, was a familiar ache in Barty's soul.  The leaky faucet, a seemingly insignificant problem, somehow mirrored the larger, more elusive leaks in his own life.
