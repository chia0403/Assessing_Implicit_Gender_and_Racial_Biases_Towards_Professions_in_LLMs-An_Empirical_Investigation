The flickering fluorescent hum of the abandoned factory was the only soundtrack to Amelia "Sparky"  Jenkins's solitary existence.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the grimy window of the electrical vault, illuminating the intricate web of wires and sparking components that were Sparky's kingdom.  Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless percussion against the quiet hum of the machinery, a symphony of decay and forgotten dreams.  This particular vault, deep within the heart of the Rust Belt, wasn't just a place of work; it was a sanctuary, a refuge from the ceaseless clamor of the world outside.  Sparky, her name a testament to the electric crackle that seemed to flow through her very veins, was a master electrician, renowned—or perhaps feared—among the few who knew her name for her uncanny ability to coax life from the most dilapidated circuits.  She’d inherited the vault, and with it, the tangled threads of the factory's history, its ghosts whispering through the corroded metal. Tonight, however, a different hum pulsed through the air, a new tremor in the silence, that of a potential danger rather than the quiet hum of familiarity.
