Professor Eleanor Ainsworth, a woman whose tweed jacket seemed perpetually dusted with the fine grey motes of forgotten lectures, stared out the grimy window of her cluttered office at the sprawling, ivy-choked campus.  The autumn air, thick with the scent of decaying leaves and damp earth, mirrored the stagnant feeling in her chest.  For weeks, the vibrant colours of the academic year had dulled, replaced by a leaden grey monotony.  Not just the leaves, not just the weather, but the very essence of the hallowed halls of Blackwood University seemed to be whispering secrets she couldn't quite grasp.  Her office, a small, cluttered room tucked away on the third floor of the oldest building, reeked of old paper and the faint, cloying aroma of burnt coffee.  Bookshelves, overflowing with volumes on arcane history and forgotten languages, leaned precariously against each other, threatening to topple under the weight of accumulated knowledge.  A half-eaten bowl of fruit sat on the desk, its once-bright colours now muted and slightly bruised, a stark reflection of Eleanor's own emotional state.  The relentless ticking of a grandfather clock in the hallway amplified the sense of pressure, the rhythmic pulse of time pressing down on her, a weight she felt she could no longer bear.
