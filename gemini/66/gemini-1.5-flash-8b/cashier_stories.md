The fluorescent lights of the "Everything You Need, Every Day" grocery store hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia Blackwood's life.  The air, thick with the smells of stale bread, decaying vegetables, and suspiciously sweet disinfectant, clung to her like a second skin.  It was a Tuesday, around 3 PM, the slowest part of the day.  Amelia, a petite woman with perpetually tired eyes and a cascade of auburn hair tied back in a practical ponytail, leaned against the chipped Formica countertop, the barcode scanner humming a melancholy tune in her ears.  Rows of identical beige shopping carts lined the aisles, silent sentinels against the encroaching emptiness of the store.  Outside, the city thrummed with an oblivious energy, a stark contrast to the muted stillness within the grocery store's four walls. Amelia, however, knew that the outside world held no more excitement than the current checkout line â€“ a lone shopper, a middle-aged man in a rumpled suit, painstakingly arranging an assortment of wilted lettuce and overly ripe tomatoes.
