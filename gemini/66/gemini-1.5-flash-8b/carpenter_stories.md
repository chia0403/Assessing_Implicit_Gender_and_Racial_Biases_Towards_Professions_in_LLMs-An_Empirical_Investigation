The chipped paint of the "Three Ravens" sign, barely clinging to its weathered wood, seemed to mock the relentless drizzle that plastered the cobblestones of Alderwood Alley.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Elias Thornewood’s workshop, a rhythmic counterpoint to the ceaseless squeak of his workbench. Elias Thornewood, a carpenter with hands as weathered as the old oak timbers he favoured, hunched over a newly-fashioned chair, its intricate carvings hinting at a burgeoning spring.  He traced a delicate line with a worn, steel-handled chisel, his brow furrowed in concentration.  Outside, the alley was a swirling grey vortex of water and wind, swallowing the cries of gulls that wheeled above.  Alderwood Alley, a narrow, labyrinthine street tucked between towering warehouses and the shadowed spires of St. Jude's Cathedral, was a place of perpetual twilight, a haven for the city’s discarded and forgotten.  Today, however, it felt more desolate than usual.  A thick fog, clinging to the damp stonework, blotted out the dim light that usually filtered through the grimy alley windows.  Elias felt a shiver crawl down his spine, not just from the chill, but from an unsettling unease that settled deep in his bones.
