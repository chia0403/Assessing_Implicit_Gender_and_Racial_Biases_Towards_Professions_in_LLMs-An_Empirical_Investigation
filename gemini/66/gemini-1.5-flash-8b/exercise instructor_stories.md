The rusted hoops, the chipped paint, the overgrown weeds â€“ they were all part of the character, part of the story.  Tonight, she wouldn't just be leading a workout; she'd be weaving a narrative, one that would ignite a spark in her loyal clients, a spark that would burn bright, even beyond the concrete jungle of East LA.
