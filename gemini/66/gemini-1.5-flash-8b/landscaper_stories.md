The biting wind whipped Amelia Nightingaleâ€™s auburn hair across her face, stinging her eyes as she surveyed the skeletal remains of the garden.  Not a single vibrant bloom dared to poke its head through the frost-kissed earth.  The once-lush, emerald tapestry of the Blackwood Estate, a testament to her meticulous handiwork just a month ago, now lay dormant, a victim of the merciless winter.  Amelia, a landscaper with a fiery spirit and hands that seemed to coax life from the very stones, felt a familiar pang of frustration.  This wasn't the first time winter had dealt a harsh blow to her carefully cultivated visions.  But this year, the despair felt deeper. The Blackwood family, her clients for the past five years, were moving, and with them, a piece of her heart seemed to go.

The Blackwood Estate, perched atop a windswept hill overlooking the shimmering sapphire waters of the Emerald Coast, exuded an air of imposing grandeur.  Towering oak trees, once draped with vibrant ivy, now stood stark and barren against the grey sky.  Intricate stone walls, painstakingly crafted by generations of Blackwood hands, whispered tales of bygone summers and extravagant parties.  Amelia, however, had never seen the estate as merely a monument to wealth.  She'd always viewed it as a blank canvas, and in her hands, a breathtaking garden. Each perfectly placed rose bush, each intricately carved topiary, had borne the mark of her meticulous artistry, imbued with the love and care she poured into every project.  Now, the silence was deafening, a stark contrast to the vibrant energy she usually infused into the space.
