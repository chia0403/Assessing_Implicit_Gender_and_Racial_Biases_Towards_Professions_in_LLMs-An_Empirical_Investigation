The fluorescent lights of the "Tech-Savvy Solutions" showroom buzzed, a relentless hum that seemed to vibrate through Amelia Blackwood's very bones.  Each day felt like wading through quicksand, the meticulously arranged displays of futuristic gadgets – foldable phones, self-stirring coffee makers, smart gardening systems –  all vying for attention.  Amelia, however, felt more like a tiny ant lost amidst a vast, shiny anthill.  Her assigned corner, dedicated to the "Intuitive Interface" line of wearable tech, held a surprising array of sleek, metallic bracelets and armbands, all promising seamless integration with the user's daily life.  But Amelia, amidst the futuristic promises, felt more disconnected than ever. The relentless pressure to hit quotas, the impersonal smiles she plastered on for potential buyers, the constant barrage of company jargon – it all felt hollow.  Today, a particularly demanding client, Mr. Alistair Finch, a notoriously difficult and notoriously wealthy investor, loomed over her display, his expression a mask of unimpressed scrutiny.  The showroom was a silent stage, and Amelia was the unwitting performer.
