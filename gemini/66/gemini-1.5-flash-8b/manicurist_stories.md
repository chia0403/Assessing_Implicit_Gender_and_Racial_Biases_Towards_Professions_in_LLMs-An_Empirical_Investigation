The chipped paint of the chipped porcelain sink, a faded, sickly turquoise, mirrored the bruised plum of Amelia Nightingale's nail polish.  Her small salon, "The Polished Petal," nestled on a quiet side street in the heart of the rain-slicked, fog-choked city of Aethelgard.  The streetlights, struggling against the persistent grey, cast long, skeletal shadows across the window panes, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air.  Amelia, her fingers still stained with the faintest trace of crimson from a recent pedicure, stared out at the cityscape.  Each building, each alleyway, each flickering neon sign, seemed to hold a secret, whispered only in the rustling wind.  The rhythmic whirring of her antique rotary phone punctuated the otherwise silent room.  A client, or perhaps a worry, was waiting.
