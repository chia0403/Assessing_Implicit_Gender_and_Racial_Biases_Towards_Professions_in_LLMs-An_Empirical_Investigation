The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the polished floor of the Grand Imperial Hotel.  Dust motes, illuminated like tiny, ethereal fireflies, swirled in the air, mingling with the faint scent of lavender soap and stale cigars.  Rain hammered against the ornate, copper-framed windows, a relentless percussion that seemed to echo the frantic rhythm of the city outside.  This was the realm of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, bellhop extraordinaire – or, at least, that was the title he bestowed upon himself.  At twenty-two, he possessed a surprisingly comprehensive knowledge of the hotel’s labyrinthine corridors, the idiosyncrasies of its clientele, and the precise location of every misplaced penny in the lobby.  But tonight, even Barty's meticulous routine felt disrupted. A sudden, sharp clang from the ballroom above sliced through the hushed atmosphere, jarring him from his nightly inventory of lost luggage tags.  He felt a prickle of unease, a feeling he couldn't quite place. The rain, it seemed, was intensifying, mirroring the storm brewing within him.
