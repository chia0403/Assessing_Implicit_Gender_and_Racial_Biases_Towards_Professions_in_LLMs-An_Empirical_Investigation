Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the makeshift clinic, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Dr. Anya Petrova.  The air hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and fear.  Anya, Emergency Medical Care Technician (EMCT) at the remote mountain village of Veridian Glade, stared at the flickering fluorescent light above.  It cast long, dancing shadows over the worn wooden table where a young woman lay, her breath coming in ragged gasps.  The woman, Elara Thorne, was clutching her chest, her face pale and drawn.


The setting: Veridian Glade, nestled deep within the jagged peaks of the Aethelred Mountains.  Years of isolation had fostered a close-knit community, but whispers of a rising sickness had begun to stir unease in the valley.  The clinic, a small, battered structure patched together with scavenged materials, was the only point of medical help for the entire population. Supplies were sparse, the equipment outdated, and the knowledge of the terrain vital for those who dared to venture out.  Dr. Anya Petrova, or simply "Anya" to those who knew her, was more than just a medical technician; she was a guardian angel to the villagers, a beacon of hope in the relentless mountain wilderness.
