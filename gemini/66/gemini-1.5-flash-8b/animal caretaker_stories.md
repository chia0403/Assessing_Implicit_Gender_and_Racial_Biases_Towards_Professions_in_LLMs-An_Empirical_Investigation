The biting wind whipped Amelia Finch's threadbare scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks as she surveyed the sprawling aviary.  Sunrise painted the frosted glass of the Great Hawk's enclosure a bruised purple, the only warmth in the pre-dawn air emanating from the hissing steam escaping the copper pipes that snaked through the cavernous structure.  Amelia, Animal Caretaker at Blackwood Manor, adjusted her worn leather gloves.  The icy grip on the metal didn't compare to the chill that settled in her bones, a constant companion since the passing of her mother, also a keeper at Blackwood Manor.

Blackwood Manor, a sprawling gothic edifice perched precariously on the edge of a windswept moor, had always been Amelia's world.  Its towering, ivy-clad walls seemed to whisper secrets of the birds that nested within its stone heart.  This was her domain, a place teeming with creatures both magnificent and fragile, a kingdom ruled by the rhythmic chirps and screeches that echoed through the hallways.  From the magnificent Andean condors circling high above the skylight to the tiny finches flitting between the blossoms in the indoor gardens, every feathered friend held a piece of her heart.  And now, the responsibility for their well-being, for their future, rested squarely on her shoulders.
