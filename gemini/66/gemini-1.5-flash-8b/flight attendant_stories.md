The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine and something vaguely metallic – perhaps the recycled air filters struggling to keep pace with the influx of passengers.

Amelia knew every inch of this terminal, the labyrinthine corridors, the cramped duty-free shops, the fleeting glimpses of familiar faces in the crowds. It was a place of both excitement and familiar, quiet tension, the stage for a thousand stories, many of which she herself was a silent observer.
