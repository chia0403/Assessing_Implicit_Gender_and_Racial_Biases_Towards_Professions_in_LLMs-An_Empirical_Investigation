The chipped paint on the kindergarten classroom walls, a faded mural of friendly woodland creatures, seemed to sigh with the afternoon sun.  Dust motes danced in the golden light filtering through the tall windows overlooking the whispering willow trees of Willow Creek Elementary.  A gentle breeze rustled the leaves outside, a lullaby to the twenty-two tiny humans scattered across the room.  Amelia Rose Hawthorne, a kindergarten teacher with a heart overflowing with sunshine and a patience forged in years of dealing with spilled paint and runaway imaginations, surveyed her charges.  Today's project:  building miniature bridges from recycled cardboard.  Amelia's classroom, a haven of colourful chaos, was buzzing with the low thrum of creative energy.  Every corner held the remnants of a nascent masterpiece.
