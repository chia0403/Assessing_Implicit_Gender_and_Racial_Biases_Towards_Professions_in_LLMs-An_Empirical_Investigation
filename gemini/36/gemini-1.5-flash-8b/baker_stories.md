The aroma of freshly baked sourdough, a symphony of yeasty tang and toasted grain, hung heavy in the air of the Parisian bakery.

This was the daily ritual of  Elodie Dubois, the baker, and the heart and soul of her tiny, yet celebrated, bakery.  But today, a peculiar chill permeated the usually jovial atmosphere.  A chill that had nothing to do with the November air seeping through the uninsulated back room.
