The fluorescent lights of the "Tax Relief Express" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Peabody's daily grind.  Paperclips clattered, staplers clicked, and the faint scent of stale coffee mingled with the acrid tang of correction fluid.  Amelia, a woman sculpted from years of late nights and meticulously organized filing systems, stared at the latest Form 1040.  Another self-employed artist, another bewildering array of deductions for supplies and studio time.  The sheer volume of paperwork seemed to swell in the cramped office, a concrete jungle of tax forms and anxious clients.

Amelia, 32 with tired eyes that somehow held a spark of quiet determination, adjusted her thick-rimmed glasses.  Outside, the rain hammered against the storefront windows, mirroring the relentless rhythm of tax season.  The Tax Relief Express, nestled in a quiet strip mall on the outskirts of the city, was a beacon of hope for those drowning in tax forms â€“ or a source of dread for those who harbored a deep-seated fear of numbers and legalese. Today, Amelia faced a particularly thorny client: a renowned but wildly eccentric sculptor named Theodore "Theo" Butterfield, whose tax situation was as intricate as his creations.  Amelia knew, with a sinking feeling, that this was going to be a long day.
