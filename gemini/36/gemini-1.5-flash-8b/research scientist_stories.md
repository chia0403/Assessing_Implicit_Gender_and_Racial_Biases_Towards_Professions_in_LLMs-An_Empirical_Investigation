The fluorescent hum of the lab echoed through Dr. Anya Petrova's ears, a constant, low thrum that seemed to vibrate in her very bones.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the grime-coated window of the subterranean research facility, illuminating the scattered, half-eaten bowls of instant ramen that littered her makeshift workspace.  Anya, her long braid falling across her tired shoulders, hunched over a microscope, her brow furrowed in concentration.  The lab, located deep beneath the crumbling, forgotten city of Veridia, was a testament to forgotten glories, and perhaps equally, to the desperate pragmatism of its occupants.  Rust-stained pipes groaned in the humid air, punctuated by the rhythmic drip-drip-drip of water leaking from somewhere unseen.  This wasn't the high-tech lab of her graduate dreams.  This was survival.  Tonight, Anya's focus wasn't on Nobel Prizes or groundbreaking discoveries.  It was on finding a solution – any solution – to the strange anomalies plaguing the mutated fungal lifeforms she'd discovered. The very existence of Veridia itself seemed to depend on it.
