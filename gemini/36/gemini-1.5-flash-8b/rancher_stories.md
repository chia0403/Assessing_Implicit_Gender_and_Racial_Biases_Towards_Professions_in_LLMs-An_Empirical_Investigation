The wind, a relentless, rasping voice, howled across the vast expanse of the Painted Hills, whipping dust devils into swirling motes of ochre and gold.  Dust stung Amelia "Em" Cartwright's eyes as she squinted at the horizon, the endless plains stretching out like a sea of tawny fur.  Her weathered hands, calloused from years of working the land, tightened on the reins of her horse, a magnificent sorrel named Comet.  The midday sun beat down on her, baking the already arid earth, and the air, thick with the smell of sagebrush and impending storm, pressed in on her, making the silence almost deafening.  Em Cartwright, rancher of the Sunstone Ranch, had never known a day like this.


The setting: The Sunstone Ranch, nestled in the heart of the Painted Hills region of southeastern Oregon, existed as a stark testament to both the raw beauty and unforgiving nature of the American West.  Rolling hills, sculpted by centuries of wind and rain, were splashed with hues of red, gold, and ochre, creating a landscape that seemed both vibrant and spectral.  Sunstone Ranch, a sprawling spread of grasslands and juniper trees, was home to not only Em, but a handful of other families, all bound together by the shared hardships and camaraderie of the rural life.  Water was scarce, and the only reliable source for the ranch was a well-protected spring, the lifeblood of the entire community.  Today, however, even that spring seemed to be holding its breath, and the ominous rumble in the distance suggested a storm was far more than just a possibility.
