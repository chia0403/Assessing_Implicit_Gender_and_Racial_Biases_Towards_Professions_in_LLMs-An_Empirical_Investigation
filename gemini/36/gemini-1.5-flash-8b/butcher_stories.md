It was a Tuesday, the day the local farmers' market overflowed with the bounty of the season â€“ plump, ruby-red tomatoes, crisp, green lettuce, and the pungent, earthy breath of the late-summer harvest.  But Barty was unmoved, his gaze fixed on the gleaming steel of his cleaver, a familiar comfort in the harshness of the day.  He was a creature of routine, of precise cuts and measured movements, a whisper of a man in the midst of the boisterous, bustling market.
