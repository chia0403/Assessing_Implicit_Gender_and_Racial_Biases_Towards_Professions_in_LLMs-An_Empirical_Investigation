The rain hammered against the oriel windows of the Grand Elysian Hotel, a symphony of muted percussion against the hushed grandeur within.  Rain-slicked cobblestones, reflecting the city's neon glow, stretched out before Amelia  Seraphina  Delacroix, the Grand Elysian's head concierge.  For Amelia, this was the soundtrack to a thousand whispered secrets, a backdrop to countless arrivals and departures, to fleeting romances and whispered anxieties.  Tonight, though, the rhythm of the rain seemed to echo a different kind of storm â€“ one brewing within the opulent, velvet-lined halls of the hotel itself.  The heavy scent of lilies and sandalwood, usually a comforting balm, felt oppressive, thick as the mist clinging to the Seine beyond. Amelia adjusted her perfectly tailored ivory uniform, the crisp linen a stark contrast to the damp chill in the air.  The clock on the mantelpiece chimed eleven.  Eleven o'clock, and a single, insistent knock echoed from the deserted reception area.
