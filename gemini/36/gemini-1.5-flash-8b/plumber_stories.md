The flickering neon sign of "Speedy Pipes" cast a sickly yellow glow across the grimy alley.  Rain hammered against the corrugated metal roof, a relentless percussion that echoed the frantic drumming in Amelia "Ace"  Fitzwilliam's ears.  She swore she could hear the pipes groaning, a low, guttural sigh rising from the bowels of the dilapidated Victorian mansion at the end of the alley.  Ace, a plumber with grease stains permanently etched onto her overalls and grit embedded in her perpetually furrowed brow, knew that groan. It meant trouble.  Trouble that smelled suspiciously of overflowing sewage and a very unhappy landlord.

The setting was the perpetually damp, industrial heart of  Newhaven, a city choked by a relentless fog that clung to the cobbled streets and the shadowed alleyways like a shroud.  Victorian architecture, once grand and imposing, was now crumbling under the weight of years and neglect.  The air hung thick with the smell of mildew, damp earth, and something faintly metallic, like rusted iron.  Within this labyrinth of narrow streets and towering buildings, Speedy Pipes was more than just a plumbing service; it was a lifeline, a whispered promise of relief in a city that seemed perpetually drowning in its own grime.
