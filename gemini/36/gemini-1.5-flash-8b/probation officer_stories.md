The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's trench coat around her legs as she hurried down the rain-slicked streets of Oakhaven.  The city, a sprawling tapestry of Victorian-era architecture and newer, more sterile concrete apartment blocks, seemed to hold its breath, the grey sky mirroring the heavy mood of the day.  Amy, a probation officer with the city’s Department of Community Corrections, clutched her thermos of lukewarm coffee, a familiar companion on these late-afternoon patrols.  The faint smell of damp earth and something vaguely floral clung to the air, a deceptive perfume in the face of the impending chill.  She'd been assigned a new case, and the premonition of a long night, and possibly a few more tense encounters, gnawed at the edges of her thoughts.  Tonight’s subject,  18-year-old Leo Donovan, was a challenge, even by Oakhaven’s standards.  This wasn't just about a simple probation violation; this was about a pattern of risky behaviors and a future that seemed increasingly uncertain, and tonight, Amy had a feeling she was about to find out what lurked beneath the surface of Leo's quiet facade.
