The chipped paint of the playroom walls, a faded shade of lavender, seemed to sigh with the afternoon humidity.  Sunlight, fractured by the grime-coated windows, cast long, dancing shadows across the colourful toys scattered haphazardly on the floor.  This was the "Rainbow Room," a haven of scraped knees and joyful shrieks, a chaotic but cherished corner of the Elmwood Community Centre.  And Amelia Rose Davies, a child care worker with eyes the colour of stormy seas and a heart brimming with patience, was its quiet anchor.  Today, however, the anchor felt more like a frayed rope, about to snap under the weight of a particularly difficult afternoon.
