The scent of beeswax and faded roses hung heavy in the air of Amelia Featherstonehaugh’s atelier.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom of the tiny workshop, illuminating the intricate patterns meticulously pinned to the worn oak table.  Amelia, a woman of thirty-two with eyes the colour of a stormy sea and hands that moved with the grace of a hummingbird, meticulously adjusted a delicate lace appliqué.  Her workshop, tucked away behind the bustling market stalls of 18th-century London, was a haven, a sanctuary filled with the hushed whispers of fabric and the quiet hum of her sewing machine.  It was a space where the mundane world faded, replaced by the delicate symphony of thread and design.  Outside, the clamor of the city echoed, a constant reminder of the bustling life Amelia often yearned to escape into the quiet world of her artistry.
