The fluorescent hum of the law office, a perpetual, low-level drone, vibrated through Amelia Stone's tired bones.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun filtering through the grimy windowpanes, illuminating the swirling chaos of legal documents scattered across her desk.  Amelia, a paralegal at the sprawling firm of Sterling & Thorne, sighed, the sound swallowed by the echoing clatter of keyboards and the hushed whispers of hushed conversations.  Her meticulously organized, meticulously colour-coded legal files, painstakingly arranged by case number and client, seemed to mock her in their pristine order.

The setting was a cramped, windowless office on the tenth floor of a towering, glass-and-steel skyscraper in the heart of downtown Chicago.  The relentless city noise, a symphony of horns and distant sirens, pounded against the reinforced glass, mirroring the relentless pressure Amelia felt.  The air, thick with the scent of stale coffee and legal pad paper, clung to the air like a second skin.  She'd been meticulously sorting through years of case files for a potential class-action suit, the details and deadlines overwhelming. The sheer volume of paperwork, each document like a tiny, weighted stone, threatened to crush her.
