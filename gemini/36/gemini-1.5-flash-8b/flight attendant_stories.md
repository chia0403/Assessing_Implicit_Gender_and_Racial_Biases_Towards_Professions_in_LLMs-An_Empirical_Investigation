The fluorescent lights of the cramped, pressurized cabin hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Hayes's weary existence.  Outside, the jagged peaks of the Himalayas, a breathtaking panorama in the brochure, were now just a blur of grey-white in the deepening twilight. Amelia, a flight attendant with the Aerolineas del Cielo, adjusted her uniform, the crisp, starched fabric a stark contrast to the knot of anxiety in her stomach.  She was on her seventh consecutive flight from Kathmandu to Delhi, and the endless cycle of preparing meals, refilling drinks, and calming anxious passengers was starting to feel like a cage.

The setting was the pressurized cabin of Flight 743, a Boeing 787 Dreamliner, as it crested the last of the towering peaks and descended into the valley below. The cabin, normally a space of controlled chaos, was unusually quiet.  The faint scent of jasmine from a passenger's perfume, usually a welcome aroma, was now almost cloying in the stillness.  Amelia could feel the shift in the atmosphere, a palpable change that mirrored the heavy feeling in her chest.  Her mind raced, recalling the anxious glances exchanged with the elderly couple seated in 27A, their hands clasped tightly together as the plane lurched.  There was something more to their apprehension than a simple fear of flying.
