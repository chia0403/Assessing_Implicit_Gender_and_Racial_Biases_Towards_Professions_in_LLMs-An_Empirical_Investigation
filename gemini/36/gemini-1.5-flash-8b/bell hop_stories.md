The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual grey-brown from decades of lukewarm water and forgotten soap suds, reflected Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's worried face.  The grand, ornate clock in the lobby of the  "Grand Imperial Hotel" ticked with an almost malevolent precision, each chime echoing the relentless drumming of Barty's anxious heart.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight piercing the heavy velvet curtains, illuminating the swirling chaos of luggage, discarded newspapers, and the general disarray that seemed to have taken root in the hotel like a particularly tenacious weed.  Barty, a bell hop with a perpetually rumpled uniform and eyes that held the weary wisdom of a man far older than his twenty-two years, was staring at a single, impossibly ornate, velvet-lined box.

The Grand Imperial Hotel, a monument to faded grandeur, stood on a quiet, cobbled street in the heart of a city shrouded in a perpetual twilight.  Once the social nexus of the opulent "Golden Age," the city was now a place of hushed whispers, whispered stories, and a sense of impending change.  Grey fog often clung to the buildings, clinging like a shroud to the silent streets, and the only sound was the distant, mournful cry of seagulls, as if mourning a vanished era. The heavy oak doors of the Grand Imperial seemed to sigh with each passing carriage, their brass handles tarnished and worn, yet stubbornly holding fast to their opulent past.
