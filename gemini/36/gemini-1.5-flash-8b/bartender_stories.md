The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked cobblestones outside.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of stale beer and something vaguely floral, likely from the wilting geraniums in a chipped terracotta pot on the bar.  Rain hammered against the ancient wooden windows, a relentless percussion echoing the rhythmic clinking of glasses and the low murmur of conversation.  Elias Thorne, a man whose face bore the etched map of countless nights spent behind the bar, wiped down a dusty bottle with practiced ease.  He adjusted his worn apron, a faded emerald green that had seen better days, and sighed, a sound that seemed to compress the quiet hum of the pub.  Tonight, the usual clientele – the jaded merchant, the melancholic poet, the perpetually grumpy constable – were absent, leaving Elias alone with the ghosts of laughter and lost conversations.
