The biting wind whipped Amelia Hawthorne’s auburn hair across her face as she surveyed the skeletal framework of the new Zenith Tower.  Below, the sprawling cityscape of Aethelgard, a metropolis built on the slopes of the volcanic peaks, stretched out like a patchwork quilt of grey and steel.  Volcanic ash, a fine, persistent dust, clung to everything, coating the towering buildings in a permanent, muted haze.  The year was 2247.  Amelia, a renowned architect specializing in bio-integrated structures, felt the familiar tremor of exhilaration, mixed with a prickling unease, run through her as she gazed at the towering, almost alien, form of the building.  Her firm, Hawthorne & Associates, had been tasked with creating a landmark, a living testament to the city's indomitable spirit—and Amelia felt the weight of that responsibility pressing down on her.  The Zenith Tower, a shimmering, interwoven network of living vines and organically grown steel, had to be perfect.  Not just structurally sound, but emotionally resonant.  It had to speak to the soul of Aethelgard in a way that transcended the cold, hard concrete of the past.  Today, however, she felt nothing but a hollow echo.  A tremor, deeper than the ground beneath her feet, resonated within her, a foreboding sense of something missing.  The whispering wind seemed to carry the echoes of voices, lost in the echoing silence of the construction site.
