The greasy haze clung to the air in "Rusty Wrench," a tiny, ramshackle garage tucked between a used bookstore and a bakery overflowing with the aroma of fresh croissants.  Sunlight, fractured by the grime-coated windows, barely pierced the gloom, illuminating shimmering oil slicks and the scattered debris of a thousand mechanical misfortunes.  This was the domain of Bartholomew "Barty" Blackwood, a 32-year-old auto mechanic with hands that spoke a language of wrenches and screwdrivers, a language that often, oddly, matched the poetry he kept tucked away in a leather-bound journal hidden beneath his workbench.  Today, a particularly stubborn rattle from a beat-up, mustard-yellow pickup truck named "Rusty" had brought Barty into the heart of his usual chaos.  The truck, a faithful companion to a seemingly perpetual traveler named Elias, had been brought in for its annual – or perhaps, more accurately, bi-annual – ritual of repair.  But the rattle wasn't just a rattle; it felt like something deeper, like a secret whispered beneath the engine's roaring pulse.  Barty, his brow furrowed in concentration, knew this wouldn't be an ordinary repair.
