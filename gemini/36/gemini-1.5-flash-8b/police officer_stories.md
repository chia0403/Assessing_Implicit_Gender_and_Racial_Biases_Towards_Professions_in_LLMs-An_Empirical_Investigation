The biting wind whipped Amelia Hayes's trench coat around her legs as she surveyed the desolate, snow-covered streets of Alderhaven.  The town, usually a bustling hub of activity in the crisp autumn air, was shrouded in an unnerving stillness.  Every storefront, every lamppost, seemed to be draped in a ghostly white shroud.  Even the usually boisterous sound of the train passing through the valley outside was muted, swallowed by the thick blanket of snow.  Alderhaven, a town built on the foundations of ancient mining operations, felt as if it had held its breath, waiting.  Amelia, Officer Amelia Hayes, the town’s lone police officer, felt a prickle of unease that ran deeper than the freezing temperature.

This particular December night, though, felt different.  The usual, predictable string of shoplifting cases and drunken altercations that typically filled her watch log hadn't appeared.  It was the absence of disturbance that unnerved her more than anything. The heavy snow, unlike the usual flurry that cleared swiftly, clung stubbornly to the cobblestones, each flake a tiny, silent weight pressing down on the already tense atmosphere.

The scent of pine needles and something else, something metallic and acrid, hung heavy in the air, a strange counterpoint to the fresh, icy air.  Amelia traced the outline of the small, snow-dusted sign that read “The Copper Kettle” with her gloved hand. The only light in the entire block, a single flickering bulb hung above the entrance of the old, ramshackle pub, cast long, distorted shadows over the street.
