The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow over Amelia Rose Holloway, highlighting the dust motes dancing in the humid air.  Sweat beaded on her forehead, despite the lukewarm August evening.  The scent of stale beer and frying onions hung heavy in the air, a familiar symphony of smells that accompanied her every shift.  Tonight, however, it felt different, thicker, almost oppressive.  The air buzzed with a low hum, not of conversation, but of anticipation, a simmering unease that she couldn't quite place.

The Rusty Mug was a dive bar nestled between a dilapidated warehouse district and a sprawling, forgotten park.  Inside, the booths were worn, the linoleum floor speckled with countless spills and scuffs.  A jukebox, its knobs and buttons dulled with age, coughed out a mournful rendition of a blues song.  Dim, flickering lights cast long shadows across the room, emphasizing the chipped paint and the general air of neglect.  Yet, the place held a strange, comforting familiarity for Amelia, a sanctuary of sorts, even in its dilapidated state.  Tonight, though, the familiar feltâ€¦unsettled.
