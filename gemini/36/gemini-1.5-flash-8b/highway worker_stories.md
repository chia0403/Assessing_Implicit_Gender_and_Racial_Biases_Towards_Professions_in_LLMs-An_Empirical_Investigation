The biting wind, a relentless, icy whisper, clawed at Amelia Stone's face as she wrestled with the stubborn bolt on the bridge's support beam.  Dust, kicked up by the rare passing tractor-trailer, stung her eyes, blurring the already skeletal landscape of the desolate highway.  The sun, a pale disc struggling to pierce the grey shroud of the Wyoming sky, cast long, skeletal shadows across the barren plains.  Amelia, her name etched into the calloused leather of her gloves, swore under her breath, the sound lost in the howl of the wind.  She was a highway maintenance worker, one of the few souls visible in this vast expanse of nothing but asphalt and sky, a solitary figure in a landscape as wide and unforgiving as the heart of a winter storm.  The year was 1958.  The interstate, a ribbon of promise and progress, stretched into the horizon, a gleaming, grey monument to the future. But here, at this desolate section, outside the town of Red Butte, Wyoming, the future felt a thousand miles away.
