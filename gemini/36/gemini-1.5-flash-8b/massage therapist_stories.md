Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of "The Healing Hands," a tiny, almost hidden massage parlour tucked between a bakery and a pawn shop on the rain-slicked side street.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of lavender oil and anticipation.  A single bare bulb illuminated Amelia Nightingale, her brow furrowed in concentration as she kneaded the tense muscles of a client, a nervous woman named Ms. Petrov.  The rhythmic squeak of the massage table was the only sound other than the relentless drumming of the rain against the tin.  Amelia, a woman of thirty-two with eyes the colour of polished amber and hands that moved with a quiet, practiced grace, was a master of calming chaos.  She knew that the tension in Ms. Petrov's shoulders mirrored the storm brewing within her clientâ€™s life, and that her quiet, focused ministrations were the first step toward easing it.  The room held the promise of comfort and solace, a refuge from the tumultuous world outside.
