Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the "Friendly Skies Insurance" office, mimicking the relentless drumming in Amelia "Amy"  Fitzwilliam's head.  The small, cramped office, located in the perpetually overcast town of Oakhaven, smelled faintly of stale coffee and desperation.  Posters advertising various home and auto insurance packages, faded and slightly ripped, clung precariously to the walls.  A single flickering fluorescent light buzzed above Amyâ€™s cluttered desk, casting long shadows that danced with the raindrops.  Outside, the wind howled, rattling the dusty windows, a mournful symphony to the growing anxiety in her chest.  It was a Tuesday afternoon, the kind that promised nothing but more of the same, and Amy was already drowning in a sea of rejected claims.  Her phone, perpetually ringing with calls from disgruntled clients, felt like a mocking metronome counting down to yet another sleepless night.
