The clatter of pots and pans, a rhythmic symphony of sizzling bacon and simmering sauces, filled the small, dimly lit kitchen.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight piercing the grime-streaked windowpanes of "The Rusty Spoon."  This wasn't a grand establishment, more a greasy haven tucked away on a side street of the sprawling, grey city of Aethelgard.  It was here, amidst the steam and the aroma of garlic and rosemary, that Elara Blackwood, a cook with hands as weathered and scarred as the worn wooden tables, meticulously prepared her evening's offerings.  Her apron, stained with the hues of countless meals, was tied tight around her waist, a familiar comfort.  The rhythmic pulse of the city outside faded to a low hum, lost in the more insistent rhythm of the kitchen.  The air, usually thick with the scent of exhaust fumes and damp brick, was temporarily filled with the tantalising promise of tonight's special:  roasted lamb with rosemary potatoes and a hint of saffron.
