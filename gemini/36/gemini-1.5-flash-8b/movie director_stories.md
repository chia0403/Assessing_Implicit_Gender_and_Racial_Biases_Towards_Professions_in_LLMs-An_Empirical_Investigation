The flickering neon sign of the "Golden Reel" movie theatre cast a sickly yellow glow across Amelia Nightingale's worn leather jacket.  Rain, a relentless, grey curtain, hammered against the corrugated iron awning, mirroring the storm brewing inside her.  Amelia, a director known more for her gutsy, unconventional films than her box office success, shivered, not just from the cold but from the gnawing dread that had settled like a persistent fog in her stomach.

Amelia Nightingale, at 37, had a reputation as a visionary, a risk-taker, a maverick who defied convention.  Her films, while lauded by critics and adored by a passionate, albeit small, following, had never quite broken through into the mainstream.  This, however, wasn’t a movie-related issue; this was personal.

The setting was a small, forgotten corner of the city – a sliver of urban sprawl clinging to the edge of the rapidly developing metropolis.  Abandoned warehouses jostled with crumbling apartment blocks, their rusted metal skeletons clawing at the perpetually overcast sky.  The air, thick with the smell of damp earth and decaying leaves, hung heavy with the unspoken anxieties of the neighbourhood.  This was the neighbourhood where the whispers about the missing actress, Seraphina Chen, had begun to gather strength, turning into a palpable, chilling rumour. And Amelia, despite her fear, was drawn here, like a moth to a flickering flame.
