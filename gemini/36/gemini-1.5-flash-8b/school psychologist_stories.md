Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the dilapidated school building, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic rhythm in Dr. Eleanor Vance's chest.  The air, thick with the smell of damp earth and stale cafeteria food, hung heavy in the small, windowless office.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom, illuminating a half-eaten bowl of instant ramen and a scattered pile of student reports.  Eleanor, her usually composed features etched with worry, stared at the latest report, her brow furrowed in concentration.  It was from fifteen-year-old Leo Hernandez, a student in her struggling seventh-grade class at the perpetually under-resourced Eastbrook Middle School.  The report detailed a troubling escalation in Leo's outbursts, a sharp contrast to his previously quiet and withdrawn demeanor.  The relentless downpour outside seemed to mirror the tempest brewing within the walls of Eastbrook, a storm that threatened to swallow the fragile hope clinging to the schoolâ€™s future.
