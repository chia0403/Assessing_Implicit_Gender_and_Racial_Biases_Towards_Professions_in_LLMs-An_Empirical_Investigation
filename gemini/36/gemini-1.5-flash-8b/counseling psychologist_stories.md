The biting November wind whipped through the gaps in the boarded-up windows of the dilapidated Victorian house, rattling the chipped paint and sending a shiver down Dr. Eleanor Vance's spine.  The scent of damp earth and decaying leaves clung to the air, a fitting olfactory companion to the anxieties she was about to confront.  Eleanor, a counseling psychologist with a practice nestled in the heart of the rain-swept coastal town of Alderbrook, was here, not out of choice, but because of the insistent whispers from the community.

This wasn't a typical consultation.  The house, once a vibrant hub of family life, was now a silent testament to the fractured nature of the town itself. It stood on a hill overlooking the grey expanse of Alderbrook Bay, its overgrown garden a testament to the slow decay of the community's spirit.  The whispers spoke of secrets buried beneath the shingle, of a family shattered by a tragedy that had lingered in the air for decades, leaving an insidious fog of suspicion and sorrow.  The case file, a collection of fragmented memories and half-truths, was thicker than she expected.  This was going to be far more than a routine session.  This was going to be personal.
