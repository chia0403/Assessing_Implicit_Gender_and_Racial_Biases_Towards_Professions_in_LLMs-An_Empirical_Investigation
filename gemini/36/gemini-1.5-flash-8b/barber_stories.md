Dust motes danced in the single beam of light, illuminating the fine stubble on his own jaw, a testament to the meticulousness he demanded of himself, even when the clientele consisted mostly of stray cats and the occasional bewildered tourist.  Barty's barbershop, "The Whispering Shears," was nestled in a cobbled alleyway off the bustling marketplace of Aethelgard, a city draped in perpetual twilight thanks to the perpetually overcast sky.  Rain, a constant companion in Aethelgard, dripped softly onto the corrugated iron awning, a rhythmic counterpoint to the occasional groan of the ancient wooden floorboards.  The scent of lavender and pine, clinging to the worn leather chairs and the faded crimson velvet curtains, offered a fleeting respite from the damp, earthy aroma of the alley.  Today, however, a new scent – something acrid and metallic – mingled with the familiar smells, a scent that prickled Barty's already sensitive nose.  He sighed, knowing it was time to begin another day.
