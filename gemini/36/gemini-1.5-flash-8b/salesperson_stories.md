The fluorescent lights of the "Everything You Could Ever Want" department store hummed, a relentless soundtrack to Amelia Blackwood's existence.  Dust motes danced in the pale glow, reflecting off the meticulously arranged displays of meticulously packaged trinkets.  Amelia, a woman whose energy levels seemed inversely proportional to the number of "limited-edition" figurines on display, stood behind a counter overflowing with exquisitely crafted miniature tea sets.  The scent of sandalwood and faint plastic hung in the air, a familiar perfume of the meticulously curated, yet ultimately sterile, world of retail therapy.  Today, however, the air seemedâ€¦ heavier.  A low, persistent hum of dissatisfaction echoed throughout the store, a tangible vibration that seemed to seep into Amelia's very bones. It wasn't the usual Tuesday afternoon lull; this was a different kind of quiet.  A quiet pregnant with expectation, a quiet that whispered of unspoken desires and unfulfilled dreams.
