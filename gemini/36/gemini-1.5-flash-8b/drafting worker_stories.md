Outside, the city of Aethelgard thrummed with a life he rarely experienced, a symphony of car horns and distant sirens that drifted in through the grimy windows.  The air in the room was thick with the smell of old ink and stale coffee, a scent Elias had come to associate with both frustration and the familiar comfort of routine.

Today's project, a revolutionary new hydraulic lift for the upcoming 'Titan' excavators, was proving particularly stubborn.  He'd been wrestling with the intricate system of counterweights for the past four hours, each adjustment seemingly further entangling the already convoluted design.
