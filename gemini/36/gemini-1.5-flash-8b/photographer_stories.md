The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwoodâ€™s scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks as she huddled deeper into the worn, leather-bound coat.  The cobbled alley, barely wider than a horse-drawn carriage, smelled of damp earth and something faintly metallic, a scent that clung to the old stone buildings like a shroud.  Sunlight, fractured and weak, struggled to penetrate the dense canopy of ancient, gnarled trees, casting long, skeletal shadows that danced across the uneven stone.  Amelia, a photographer with eyes the colour of stormy seas and a spirit as tenacious as the ivy clinging to the crumbling walls, adjusted her heavy camera bag.  This was the heart of the forgotten district, the district whispered about in hushed tones and avoided by those who could.  This was where she found her stories.  This was where her photographs were born.
