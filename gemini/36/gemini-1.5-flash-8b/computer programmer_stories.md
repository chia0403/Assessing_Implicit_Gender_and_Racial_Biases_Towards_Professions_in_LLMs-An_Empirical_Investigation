Amelia, a 27-year-old computer programmer with eyes that held the depth of a forgotten galaxy and a mind that seemed to operate on a different temporal plane, was immersed in her latest project: a revolutionary augmented reality platform for interactive historical narratives.  The air hung thick with the aroma of burnt coffee and desperation, a constant companion in her late-night coding sessions.
