Rain hammered against the slate roof of the dilapidated theatre, a mournful counterpoint to the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Amelia Nightingale's heart.  The Grand Coliseum, once a beacon of glittering spectacle, now stood shrouded in a melancholic mist of neglect.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the grimy window, illuminating faded posters advertising forgotten stars and long-gone melodramas.  Amelia, a woman whose energy seemed to hum even in the sepulchral silence, surveyed the cavernous space.  The stage, a vast expanse of cracked paint and splintered wood, was strewn with discarded props: a tarnished silver crown, a chipped porcelain doll, a rusted sword.  This, her beloved Grand Coliseum, was her battlefield, her canvas, her obsession.
