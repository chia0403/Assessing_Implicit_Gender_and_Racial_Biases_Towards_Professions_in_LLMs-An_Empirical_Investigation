The humid air hung thick and heavy, clinging to the polished surfaces of the salon like a second skin.  Sunlight, filtered through the gauzy curtains, painted streaks of amber across the pristine white walls of "The Gilded Shear," casting fleeting shadows on the rows of gleaming manicure stations.  A delicate floral scent, a blend of jasmine and lilac, hung in the air, mingling with the faint, almost imperceptible, aroma of freshly brewed coffee.  This was the sanctuary of Aella "Anya" Blackwood, cosmetologist extraordinaire, her fingers, nimble and practiced, danced across the polished surface of a clientâ€™s scalp.  Anya, a woman of quiet intensity with eyes that held the colour of the summer sky, meticulously sculpted a rich, chocolate brown highlight into the soft, auburn hair of a woman named  Seraphina.
