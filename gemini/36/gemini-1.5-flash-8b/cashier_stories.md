The fluorescent lights of the "Everything You Need, Nothing You Don't" superstore hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia Butterfield's life.  Each beep of the scanner, each rustle of plastic bags, each impatient sigh from a customer, blended into a white noise that was both comforting and suffocating.  Amelia, clad in a navy-blue uniform that felt like a second skin, stared blankly at the barcode of a jar of pickles.  It wasn't the pickles, or the chipped paint on the checkout counter, or the stale smell of old coffee that plagued the air, that gnawed at her.  It was the feeling that everything was…wrong.

The year was 2042.  The superstore, a sprawling concrete monolith in the heart of Neo-Manhattan, was a microcosm of the city itself – a gleaming, technologically advanced facade concealing a simmering undercurrent of discontent.  Towering skyscrapers, dotted with hovering taxis and vertical farms, scraped the sky, but the gleaming towers couldn't mask the growing chasm between the wealthy elite who lived in opulent sky-apartments and the masses who eked out a living in the crowded, under-maintained districts below.  Amelia lived in one of those districts, a sprawling apartment complex nestled amidst the city's sprawling infrastructure, barely visible from the elevated pathways.  The air, though conditioned, still held a faint metallic tang, a lingering reminder of the city's industrial core.  Outside her window, the city lights shimmered with an almost ethereal beauty, hiding the anxieties and discontent that simmered beneath the surface.
