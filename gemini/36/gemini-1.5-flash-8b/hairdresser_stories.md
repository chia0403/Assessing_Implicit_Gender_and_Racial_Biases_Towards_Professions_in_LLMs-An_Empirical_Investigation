The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual, muted grey from decades of lukewarm water and discarded hair, reflected the harsh fluorescent lights of "Scissors & Smiles."  Dust motes danced in the meagre rays, illuminating the tangled mess of colourful foils and half-empty bottles of conditioner lining the countertop.  A symphony of quiet snips and the rhythmic whir of a hair dryer filled the small salon, a tiny island of controlled chaos nestled within the bustling, grey concrete canyons of the city.  This was the domain of Amelia Nightingale, a hairdresser with hands as steady as polished obsidian and a heart that often felt as tangled as the knots she expertly unraveled.

Amelia, with her perpetually tired but kind eyes and a streak of auburn that seemed to defy the dullness around her, expertly maneuvered around a client, her movements a practiced ballet. The client, a nervous teenager with a cascading cascade of jet black hair, fidgeted in the chair, her fingers playing with the frayed edges of her worn jeans.  Today's appointment was a delicate dance of words and snips, a conversation woven into the fabric of hair, a dance between a young woman and a woman who understood her anxieties and frustrations better than she often understood herself.
