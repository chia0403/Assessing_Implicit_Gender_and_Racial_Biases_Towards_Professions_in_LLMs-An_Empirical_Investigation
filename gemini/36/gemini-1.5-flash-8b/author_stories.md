The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Blackwood's hands, the faint scent of Earl Grey clinging to the air like a forgotten memory.  Sunlight, filtered through the dusty, floral curtains of her attic study, painted the room in a soft, sepia tone.  Cobwebs, like delicate, silvery lace, draped from the eaves, catching the light in shimmering threads.  Amelia Blackwood, author of the critically acclaimed, yet commercially underwhelming, series *The Whispering Woods*, traced a finger along the rim of her mug.  The scent of old paper and damp earth mingled with the faintest whiff of something indefinably…metallic.  A low, persistent hum, like a trapped bee, echoed from the old, oak desk.  It wasn't the heat; it wasn't the usual clatter of the city beyond her window.  This was something else, something…ancient.  Her latest manuscript, *The Obsidian Mirror*, lay open before her, its pages filled with cryptic symbols and chilling descriptions.  Today, however, the words were refusing to form, the story refusing to flow.  And the hum was growing louder.
