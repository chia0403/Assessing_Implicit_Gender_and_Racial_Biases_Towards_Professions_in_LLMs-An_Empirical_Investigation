The crisp autumn air, scented with pine and decaying leaves, bit at Elias Thorne's exposed cheeks.  He tugged the collar of his worn, flannel shirt higher, a familiar gesture against the chill that seeped into the bone-deep of a November morning.  The sun, a pale, reluctant orb, cast long shadows across the meticulously manicured lawns of the Blackwood Estate, a sprawling complex of manicured hedges and towering oaks that dominated the valley floor.  Elias, a landscaper with a decade of experience shaping the landscapes of the wealthy,  knew the estate intimately, the precise contours of its winding paths and the subtle preferences of its notoriously demanding owner.  Today, however, the familiar rhythm of pruning shears and the quiet rustle of leaves had a different, almost anxious, undercurrent. Something was amiss, a disquiet that settled in the air like frost.  He was certain of it, even if he couldn't quite put his finger on the what.  

The Blackwood Estate wasn't just a collection of gardens; it was a testament to the owner's power, their wealth, their influence.   This quiet valley, nestled between the towering peaks of the Serpent's Tooth Mountains, felt almost suffocating in its opulence. Every blade of grass seemed to whisper tales of secrets and hushed power struggles, a narrative Elias, with his pragmatic hands and quiet demeanor, was uniquely positioned to observe.  The scent of freshly cut timber and wet earth hung heavy in the air, a subtle backdrop to the unspoken tensions that thrummed beneath the meticulously designed surface of the estate.
