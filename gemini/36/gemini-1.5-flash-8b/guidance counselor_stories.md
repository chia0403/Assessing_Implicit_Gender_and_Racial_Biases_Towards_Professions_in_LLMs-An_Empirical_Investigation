The fluorescent lights of the high school hallway hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia Josephine Finch's daily pilgrimage.  Her worn, navy blazer felt heavy, a weight mirroring the anxieties she carried for her students.  Each hallway corner held a potential crisis – whispered arguments erupting into shouting matches, a single tear tracing a path down a cheek, or the slumped posture of someone wrestling with something far bigger than their fifteen years.  Amelia, Guidance Counselor at Oakhaven High, navigated this labyrinth of teenage emotions with practiced empathy and an almost encyclopedic knowledge of the school’s, and the town's, support systems.  Today, however, the air felt thicker, charged with an unspoken tension that even her seasoned radar picked up.  The scent of pine-scented air freshener, usually a comforting balm, felt suffocating.  Outside, the autumn leaves, usually a riot of color, lay muted and lifeless beneath a sky that threatened rain.  This wasn't just another Tuesday; it felt like a premonition.
