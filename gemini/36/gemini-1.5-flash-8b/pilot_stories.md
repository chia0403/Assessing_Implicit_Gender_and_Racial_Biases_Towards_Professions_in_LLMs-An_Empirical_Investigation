The biting wind whipped at Amelia "Amie"  Everett's flight jacket, stinging her cheeks as she wrestled the controls of the vintage biplane, the "Spirit of the Sky," into a smoother, faster climb.  Below, the jagged peaks of the Chugach Mountains, dusted with perpetual snow, scraped the bruised blue sky.  The air, thin and crisp, tasted of pine and frozen earth.  Amie, her brow furrowed in concentration, felt the familiar thrum of the engine, a steady heartbeat against the roar of the wind.  This was her domain, the high country above Alaska, a place of breathtaking beauty and terrifying unforgivingness.  She'd flown these routes a hundred times, but today felt different, a subtle shift in the wind, a peculiar glint in the ice-covered peaks, whispering of something more than just another routine flight inspection.  Amie traced the outline of the jagged mountain ridge with her eyes, the distant peaks seeming to press in on the tiny aircraft. This wasn't just a flight; it was a search. A desperate, one-woman search for a missing pilot.
