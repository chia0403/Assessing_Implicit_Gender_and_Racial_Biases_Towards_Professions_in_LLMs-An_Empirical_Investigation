The flickering fluorescent lights of the Grand Zenith Institute hummed a mournful tune, a soundtrack to Elara Vance’s solitary vigil.  Dust motes danced in the pale beams, tracing invisible paths across the polished parquet floor.  Each one, a tiny ghost, echoed the quiet rhythm of Elara’s mopping.  The Institute, a sprawling gothic monstrosity of obsidian stone and soaring glass, stood sentinel over the city of Aethelgard, its many windows reflecting the bruised purple hues of a twilight sky.  Elara, dressed in the familiar, slightly-too-large uniform of the Institute Janitorial Staff – faded navy blue and perpetually stained – moved with the measured grace of a seasoned dancer navigating a silent stage.  Her movements were precise, almost ritualistic.  She knew every crevice, every shadowed corner of this monumental building.  She knew, in a way most others could never, the Grand Zenith Institute's secrets.  Tonight, though, her practiced routine felt…off. A faint, almost imperceptible hum thrummed beneath the floorboards.
