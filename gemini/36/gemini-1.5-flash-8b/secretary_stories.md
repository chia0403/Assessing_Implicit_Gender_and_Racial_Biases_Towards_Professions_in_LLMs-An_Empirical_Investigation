The fluorescent lights of the Sterling & Stone accounting firm hummed, a monotonous drone that seeped into Amelia Ashworth's very bones.  Dust motes danced in the pale light, mirroring the swirling thoughts in her mind.  Five years. Five years she'd been the executive secretary to Mr. Sterling, meticulously managing his calendar, fielding calls, and deciphering the cryptic jargon that seemed to be the language of high finance.  Today, however, felt different.  A palpable tension hung in the air, thick as the stale coffee brewing in the chipped ceramic pot in the break room.  A sense of foreboding, akin to the pre-storm stillness before a hurricane, pressed down on her.

The office, a sterile expanse of polished mahogany desks and steel filing cabinets, was located in a nondescript high-rise overlooking the bustling, ever-shifting cityscape of New York City.  Rain lashed against the windows, creating a rhythmic percussion that amplified the unease in the room.  The city's relentless energy, usually a vibrant backdrop, now seemed to mock the stifled atmosphere within the office. The aroma of printer toner and old paper, usually comforting, felt heavy and claustrophobic.  Amelia's small, meticulously organized office, tucked away in a corner, was the only refuge from the growing storm, but even there, the anxiety simmered.  Today, the seemingly ordinary hum of the office was about to become a hurricane.
