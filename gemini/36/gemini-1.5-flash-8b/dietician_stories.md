The aroma of burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a sickly sweet counterpoint to the metallic tang of chlorine emanating from the overflowing pool beyond Amelia “Amy” Cartwright’s window.  The small, sun-drenched apartment, nestled between a bustling bakery and a perpetually-crowded laundromat, felt like a miniature, claustrophobic version of her own life – tightly packed, undeniably present, and a little bit too much.  Amy, a registered dietician with a master’s degree in nutritional science and a heart full of lofty ideals, stared at the peeling wallpaper, its floral pattern a faded echo of a life she’d tried, and failed, to decorate.  Rain hammered against the corrugated metal awning, mirroring the relentless drumming in her head.  The looming deadline for the presentation on “Sustainable Dietary Practices for Urban Populations” felt like a concrete weight on her chest.  Amy was running late.

The year was 2024.  The city, sprawling across the western coastal plain, was a kaleidoscope of vibrant, yet struggling, life.  Towering skyscrapers pierced the smog-choked sky, their gleaming surfaces reflecting the relentless glare of the Californian sun.  Beneath them, streets swarmed with pedestrians – a diverse mix of hurried office workers, street vendors hawking exotic fruits, and the ubiquitous drone delivery vehicles buzzing silently overhead.  The city’s sprawling urban gardens, vibrant patches of green in the concrete jungle, were Amy's one small sanctuary.  She frequented the rooftop garden at the community center near her apartment, a haven where sunlight filtered through the foliage and the air hummed with the faint, rhythmic sounds of urban life, providing her respite from the mounting pressure of her profession and the chaotic rhythm of her neighborhood.
