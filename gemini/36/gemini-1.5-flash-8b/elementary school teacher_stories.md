The chipped paint of the kindergarten classroom walls, a faded, pastel blend of lavender and mint green, seemed to sigh with the afternoon humidity.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the grimy windowpane, illuminating the scattered construction paper creations â€“ a patchwork quilt of fantastical beasts and rainbow-hued houses.  Amelia Rose Hawthorne, a third-year elementary school teacher with eyes the colour of warm honey, surveyed her charges.  Ten small bodies, a whirlwind of whispered secrets and sticky fingers, were engaged in their own intricate dramas.  One child, a freckled boy named Leo, was meticulously constructing a tower of colourful blocks, his brow furrowed in concentration. Another, a girl with braids the colour of spun gold, was lost in a world of whispered stories, her gaze fixed on a drawing of a majestic dragon.  Amelia, perched on a wobbly plastic chair beside her small table, watched them with a smile that held a quiet contentment.  This, after all, was her sanctuary, her haven in the bustling, sometimes overwhelming, world of childhood.
