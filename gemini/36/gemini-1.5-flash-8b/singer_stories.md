The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked cobblestones of Alderbrook.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic rhythm beating in Elara Nightingale's chest.

The familiar warmth of the crowd felt icy, cold and unwelcoming.  A sense of dread, thick as the fog clinging to the riverbank outside, settled over her.  This wasn't just a bad night; this was something else entirely.  The melody that had once flowed so freely now felt trapped, choked by the suffocating fear rising in her throat.
