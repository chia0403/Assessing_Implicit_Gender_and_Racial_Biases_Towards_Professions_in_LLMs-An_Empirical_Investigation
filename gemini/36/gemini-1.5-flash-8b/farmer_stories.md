The biting wind, a relentless, whispering serpent, clawed at Elias Thorne's worn sheepskin coat.  Dust devils, the colour of burnt umber, danced across the cracked earth of the Sunstone Valley, a landscape scarred by years of drought.  Twisted, skeletal trees, their branches clawing at the perpetually bruised sky, were the only witnesses to Elias's solitary struggle.

The valley, once a verdant tapestry of wheat and barley, now resembled a parched mouth, begging for the life-giving rain that had forsaken it for a decade.  Elias, a farmer of the Sunstone Valley for forty years, was now wrestling not just with the elements, but with a creeping despair that threatened to devour him as surely as the desert sun devoured the last vestiges of hope.
