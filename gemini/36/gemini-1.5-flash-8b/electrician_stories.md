The flickering fluorescent lights of the abandoned warehouse hummed a mournful dirge, a counterpoint to the insistent drip, drip, drip of water seeping from a rusted pipe high above.  Dust motes danced in the weak rays of the single bare bulb hanging precariously from a fractured ceiling beam.  This was the domain of  Elias Thorne, electrician extraordinaire, or, more accurately, Elias Thorne, the last man brave enough (or foolish enough) to venture into the forgotten heart of the "Ironclad."

Elias, a man built like a seasoned oak, with calloused hands that spoke volumes of a life spent wrestling with wires and volts, squinted at the tangle of electrical conduits.  He wore a worn leather apron, patched and stained with the grime of countless repairs, and a hard hat that was probably older than the building itself.  A faint smell of mildew hung heavy in the air, mingling with the acrid tang of burnt insulation.  The warehouse, once a bustling hub of industrial activity, now lay silent and decaying, a testament to the relentless march of time and the indifference of progress.  He traced the path of the culprit wire with a careful, practiced hand.  This was no ordinary electrical issue; this was a symphony of silent, insidious sabotage.
