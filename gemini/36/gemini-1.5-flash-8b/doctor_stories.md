The biting wind, a relentless claw, whipped across the exposed moorland, stinging Dr. Elara Nightingale's cheeks.  The skeletal remains of a long-abandoned farmhouse, its walls a patchwork of grey and crumbling stone, huddled against the tempest.  Rain, thick and cold, hammered against the cracked windowpanes, mirroring the relentless ache in Elara's temples.  Inside, the air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and something else, something metallic and faintly sweet, that clung to the musty air like a shroud.  She'd been summoned by a call so urgent, so desperate, that the harsh beauty of the moorland – usually a source of solace – felt strangely hostile tonight.  The call had come from the local farmer, a man weathered and stoic like the landscape itself, a man who possessed a haunted look in his eyes that spoke volumes of unspoken dread. The farmer had described a "haunting sickness" plaguing his livestock, a disease that seemed to prey on their very souls, turning them into hollowed shells, their eyes vacant with suffering.  Now, Elara stood on the precipice of something extraordinary, something that blurred the lines between the mundane and the macabre.
