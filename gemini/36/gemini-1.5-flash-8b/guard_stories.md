Snow, the consistency of crushed glass, crunched under the boots of Sergeant Kael Stormbringer as he patrolled the outer ramparts.

Kael, a seasoned guard with eyes the colour of a winter storm and a face etched with the hardships of a life spent on the edge, felt the familiar prickle of unease.  This was no ordinary patrol. The air, usually thick with the silence of the frozen wasteland, held a tremor, an almost palpable tension that resonated deep within his bones.
