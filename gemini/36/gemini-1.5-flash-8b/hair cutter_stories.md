The chipped paint of the "Snip-Snap Scissors" sign sagged precariously above Amelia "Sparky"  Fitzwilliamâ€™s head, mirroring the weariness settling in her shoulders.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless percussion against the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of her shears.  Inside, the tiny salon was a symphony of clattering chairs, whispered conversations, and the metallic tang of hairspray.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight piercing the gloom, illuminating a sea of blonde, brown, and fiery red tresses awaiting transformation.

Sparky, a woman of thirty-five with eyes that held the wisdom of countless whispered secrets and a spirit as resilient as the weathered wood of the salon's walls, hunched over her work, her fingers flying with practiced ease across the delicate strands.  The salon, tucked away on a side street in the bustling port city of Alderhaven, felt more like a sanctuary than a place of commerce.  The scent of lavender-scented conditioner and old books mingled with the salty tang of the sea that frequently blew through the cracked window.  This was her domain, a space carved from the city's chaos, a place where stories were cut, sculpted, and sometimes even mended, one strand at a time.
