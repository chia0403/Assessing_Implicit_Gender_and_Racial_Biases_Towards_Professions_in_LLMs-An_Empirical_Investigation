The chipped paint on the windowsill, a faded ochre that mimicked the dust motes dancing in the afternoon sun, mirrored the weariness in Elara Blackwood's eyes.  Her studio, a cramped attic space above the bustling, cobbled marketplace of Veridia, smelled of linseed oil and old parchment.  Sunlight, fractured and filtered through the grime-coated panes, illuminated swirling clouds of pigment dust that clung to the air like phantoms.  Roughly-hewn wooden easels cluttered the space, their canvases draped with unfinished landscapes and portraits, each a silent testament to the struggles and triumphs of the artist within.  Elara, a woman whose hands, stained a perpetual sunset of crimson and ochre, were often more expressive than her brushstrokes, felt the familiar pang of creative paralysis.  Three months. Three months since her last commission, three months since the vibrant colours had seemed to vanish from her palette.  The vibrant colours of Veridia itself, the colours she craved to capture, seemed to have faded along with her own inspiration.
