The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume only Amelia Hernandez truly appreciated.  Her salon, "Scissors & Curls," nestled on a cobbled side street in the heart of the historic district of Seville, Spain, was a riot of colour and texture.  Crimson bougainvillea spilled from overflowing terracotta pots, their vibrant blooms mirroring the fiery hues in the hand-painted tiles that adorned the walls. Sunlight, filtered through the ancient, wrought-iron balcony above, dappled the polished wooden floor, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the warm afternoon air.  Amelia, nimble fingers already weaving magic through a client’s thick, raven hair, hummed a flamenco tune under her breath, the rhythmic click of her shears a counterpoint to the distant clang of a blacksmith’s hammer.  Outside, the rhythmic pulse of Seville thrummed – a symphony of chattering voices, the clip-clop of horses' hooves on the pavement, and the ever-present, seductive scent of oranges.
