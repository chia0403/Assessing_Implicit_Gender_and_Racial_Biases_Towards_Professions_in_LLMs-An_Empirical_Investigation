The biting wind whipped across the desolate expanse of the Alaskan tundra, stinging Amelia “Amy” Fairbanks’ cheeks raw.  Ice crystals, sharp as shattered glass, clung to the heavy-duty parka she wore, a feeble barrier against the sub-zero temperatures.

The machine, affectionately nicknamed “Big Bertha” by Amy, was a behemoth of steel and power, its tracks leaving deep gouges in the permanently frozen earth.  The only other sounds were the mournful howl of the wind and the occasional, brittle crack of ice underfoot – sounds that had become the soundtrack to Amy’s life for the past five years, ever since she’d traded the manicured lawns of her Ohio hometown for the unforgiving beauty of the Alaskan wilderness.  This wasn't just a job; this was a battle against the elements, a dance with nature's raw power.
