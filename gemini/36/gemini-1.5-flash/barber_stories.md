The scent of Bay Rum and old leather hung thick in the air, a familiar perfume that clung to Elias Thorne like a second skin.  Elias, owner and sole proprietor of Thorne's Traditional Barber Shop, ran a hand, calloused and steady from years of wielding shears, over the worn mahogany countertop. Dust motes, illuminated by the single, bare bulb hanging overhead, danced in the weak afternoon sun that struggled to penetrate the grimy windowpanes.  Outside, the relentless November drizzle of Grimsborough, a town clinging stubbornly to the edge of the moors, plastered the cobblestones and sent a chill that seeped even through the double-glazed windows.  Inside, however, the air was thick with the comforting warmth of a crackling coal fire, and the low hum of conversation – usually Elias’ own quiet muttering to himself as he worked, punctuated by the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of his shears. Today, however, the shop was unusually silent, a silence more unsettling than the usual quiet hum.  The only sound, besides the crackling fire, was the persistent drumming of rain against the glass.
