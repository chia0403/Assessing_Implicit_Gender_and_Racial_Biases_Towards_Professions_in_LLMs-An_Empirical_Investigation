The chipped paint of the proscenium arch flaked like forgotten dreams onto the dusty stage floor below.  A single bare bulb, swinging precariously from a frayed wire, cast long, skeletal shadows across the cavernous space. This wasn't the grandeur of the Metropolitan Opera; this was the crumbling husk of the Majestic Theatre, a forgotten jewel in the heart of a forgotten city.  And here, amidst the ghosts of a thousand forgotten performances, sat  Isadora “Izzy” Bellweather, a theatrical director whose ambition burned brighter than any spotlight, even in this dimly lit purgatory.  Her fingers, stained with ink and coffee, traced the lines of a dog-eared script, a desperate hope flickering in her usually sharp, cynical eyes.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp plaster and the faint, almost imperceptible, aroma of decaying velvet.  The Majestic, once a palace of the performing arts, now felt more like a mausoleum.  But for Izzy, it was home.  Or, at least, it was her battleground.
