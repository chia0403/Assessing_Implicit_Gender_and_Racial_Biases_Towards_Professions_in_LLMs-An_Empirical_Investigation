The fluorescent lights of Amelia Hernandez's tax preparation office hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the frantic tap-tap-tapping of her fingers on the keyboard.  Dust motes, illuminated by the harsh glare, danced in the stagnant air of the small, cramped space.  Stacks of tax returns – some neatly organized, others teetering precariously – climbed like miniature, paper mountains across her desk and spilled onto the floor, threatening to engulf her entirely.  The air smelled faintly of stale coffee and desperation, a familiar aroma for Amelia, especially as April 15th loomed closer each day.  Outside, the relentless March wind howled a mournful dirge, mirroring the anxieties of her clients who, one by one, would soon be filing through her door, clutching their W-2s and 1099s like lifelines.  This year, however, felt different.  A knot of unease tightened in Amelia’s stomach, a feeling far more profound than the usual pre-tax season jitters.
