The biting November wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vance's dark hair across her face as she hurried down the cobbled street, the collar of her worn wool coat pulled high.  Gas lamps flickered, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to writhe and twist like the patients she'd seen earlier that day in the overflowing wards of St. Jude's Hospital.  The air, thick with the scent of coal smoke and woodsmoke mingling with the ever-present aroma of brine from the nearby docks, stung her nostrils.  Above, a bruised purple sky threatened further rain on the already sodden streets of Grimsborough, a city that clung stubbornly to the cliffs overlooking the turbulent North Sea, its weathered buildings a testament to both its resilience and its decay.  Tonight, however, Eleanor felt a different kind of decay creeping into her own bones – a weariness that went far beyond the physical exhaustion of a long shift.  Something felt…wrong.  A premonition, perhaps, or simply the overwrought nerves of a doctor carrying the weight of too many broken lives.
