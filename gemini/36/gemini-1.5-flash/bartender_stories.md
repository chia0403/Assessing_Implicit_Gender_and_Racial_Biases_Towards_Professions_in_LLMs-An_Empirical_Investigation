The chipped Formica of the bartop felt cool against Elias Thorne's cheek as he slumped against it, the rhythmic clinking of ice a counterpoint to the low thrum of conversation in The Rusty Mug.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the neon glow of the liquor store across the street into a hazy, crimson smear.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale beer, spilled whiskey, and the faint, lingering sweetness of cheap perfume – a familiar aroma that clung to Elias like a second skin after fifteen years of pulling pints in this forgotten corner of the city.  He’d seen a lot of faces drift through those doors, a kaleidoscope of joy, sorrow, desperation, and the occasional fleeting moment of genuine happiness – usually fueled by something stronger than hope.  Tonight, however, the usual melancholy was amplified, a heavy blanket woven from the damp chill and a secret that gnawed at his conscience.
