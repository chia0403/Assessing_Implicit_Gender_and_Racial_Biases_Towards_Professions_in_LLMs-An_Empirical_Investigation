The biting November wind howled a mournful dirge around the gabled roof of "Smiling Shores Dental," whipping stray leaves into frenzied pirouettes across the rain-slicked cobblestones of Seabrook Lane.  Inside, however, Dr. Eleanor Vance, DDS, found herself oddly serene.  The scent of clove and sterile antiseptic hung in the air, a familiar comfort against the tempest raging outside.  Eleanor, a woman whose smile lines spoke more of wry amusement than years spent battling cavities, adjusted her reading glasses, the faintest reflection of the storm clouds mirrored in their lenses.  She was reviewing X-rays, the rhythmic click of her pen against the chart a counterpoint to the wind's relentless symphony.  Seabrook, a picturesque coastal town famed for its quaint charm and even quainter residents, was currently experiencing its annual "November Fury," a meteorological event that tested the fortitude of even the sturdiest souls â€“ and certainly put a strain on the town's aging infrastructure.
