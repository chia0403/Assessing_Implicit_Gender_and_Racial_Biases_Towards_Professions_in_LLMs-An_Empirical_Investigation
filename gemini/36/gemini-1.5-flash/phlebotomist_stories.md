The fluorescent lights of the Meadowbrook Medical Center hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* of Amelia Katherine Hart’s own pulse.  Amelia, or Amy as everyone called her except for her formidable grandmother, adjusted the tourniquet on the patient’s arm, the thin, pale skin already showing the faint blue bloom of venous congestion.  The air hung heavy with the sterile scent of antiseptic and something vaguely floral, a desperate attempt by the hospital administration to mask the ever-present undercurrent of fear and antiseptic.  This wasn't just any Tuesday morning at Meadowbrook; a particularly virulent strain of influenza was sweeping through the region, filling the halls with coughing patients and harried nurses.  Amy, a phlebotomist with nerves of steel honed by years of dealing with needle-phobic grandmothers and surly teenagers, braced herself for the day's challenges.  Outside, the late October wind howled a mournful dirge against the hospital windows, a sound that echoed the unease settling in Amy's stomach. This flu wasn't just making people sick; it was changing them.
