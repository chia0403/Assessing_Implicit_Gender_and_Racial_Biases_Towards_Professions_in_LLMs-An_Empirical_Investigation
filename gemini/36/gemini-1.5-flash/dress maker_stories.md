The scent of lavender and old silk hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the biting November wind rattling the windowpanes of Madame Evangeline Dubois' atelier.  Rain lashed against the leaded glass, mirroring the tempestuous emotions swirling within Evangeline herself.  Her fingers, nimble and scarred from years spent coaxing life into yards of fabric, trembled slightly as she unfurled a bolt of midnight blue velvet, the rich material a stark contrast to the pale, anxious expression on her face.  The atelier itself, nestled on a cobbled street in the heart of Montmartre, was a chaotic symphony of color and texture: bolts of shimmering taffeta lined the walls, half-finished gowns draped from mannequins like elegant ghosts, and spools of thread, a rainbow of possibilities, scattered across every available surface.  Tonight, however, the usual creative chaos felt stifling, the weight of expectation pressing down on Evangeline like the Parisian rain.
