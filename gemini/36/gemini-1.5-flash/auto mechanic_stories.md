The greasy scent of motor oil clung to Amelia Hernandez like a second skin, a familiar perfume that spoke of long days spent wrestling with temperamental engines and stubborn bolts.  Amelia, her hands perpetually stained a shade somewhere between charcoal and burnt umber, leaned against the chipped paint of her workbench in Hernandez Auto Repair, a small, cluttered shop nestled on the edge of Dustbowl, Arizona.  The desert sun, a malevolent eye in the brassy sky, beat down on the corrugated iron roof, turning the air thick and shimmering.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of grit and sand, danced across the cracked asphalt of the deserted lot next door, their silent pirouettes a stark contrast to the rhythmic clang of Amelia's wrench against a stubborn lug nut.  The only other sounds were the sporadic buzz of a fluorescent light and the distant drone of a low-flying crop duster, its chemical spray a faint, acrid whisper on the wind.
