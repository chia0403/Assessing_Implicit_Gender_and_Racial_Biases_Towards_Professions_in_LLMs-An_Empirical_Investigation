The fluorescent lights of Sterling & Steele hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the relentless tap-tap-tap of Penelope Anne Featherstonehaugh's perfectly manicured fingernails on the polished mahogany desk.  Penelope, or Penny as she preferred (though almost no one dared use it), surveyed her kingdom: a sterile, impeccably organized reception area of the prestigious law firm, smelling faintly of expensive leather and slightly stale coffee.  Sunlight, filtered through the cityscape-facing windows, illuminated motes of dust dancing in the air â€“ a silent, ethereal ballet performed only for her watchful gaze.  Outside, the cacophony of downtown Manhattan pulsed, a world of chaos she diligently kept at bay, a gatekeeper to the hushed, serious world of Sterling & Steele. Today, however, a peculiar stillness hung in the air, heavier than usual, promising a day that would be anything but ordinary.
