The chipped paint of the "Eat Well, Live Well" sign flaked onto the already dusty windowsill of Dr. Eleanor Vance's nutrition practice.  A single, stubbornly persistent sunflower, squeezed into a terracotta pot far too small, leaned precariously towards the weak November sunlight filtering through the grimy glass.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of cinnamon and something vaguely floral – a desperate attempt by Eleanor to mask the lingering aroma of yesterday's slightly burnt kale chips, a testament to her own less-than-perfect adherence to her own healthy eating regime.  Her office, situated above a bustling Italian deli in the heart of Little Italy, Brooklyn, was a charming but chaotic blend of vibrant food charts, overflowing bookshelves crammed with nutritional texts, and half-empty mugs of herbal tea.  The faint hum of the city – a symphony of car horns, distant sirens, and the rhythmic clang of a nearby pizzeria's oven – provided a constant, almost comforting backdrop to the quiet anxieties that Eleanor felt simmering within her.
