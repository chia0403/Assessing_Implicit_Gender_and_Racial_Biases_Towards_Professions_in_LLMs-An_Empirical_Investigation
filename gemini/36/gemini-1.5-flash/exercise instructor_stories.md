The pre-dawn gloom clung to the city like a damp shroud, the only light spilling from the neon "OPEN 24 HOURS" sign of the greasy spoon across the street.  Inside Fitness First, however, a different kind of energy crackled.  The rhythmic thump of bass, barely audible through the thick studio walls, hinted at the controlled chaos about to erupt.  This was the domain of Alexandra "Alex"  Rivera, a woman whose smile could melt glaciers and whose fitness classes were legendary for their intensity and unwavering positivity – a stark contrast to the city’s often cynical heart.  The air, still and cool before the arrival of her 6 am Spin class, hung heavy with the scent of sweat, lemon-scented cleaning solution, and the faint, metallic tang of blood – a lingering reminder from yesterday’s particularly enthusiastic attempt at a new HIIT routine.
