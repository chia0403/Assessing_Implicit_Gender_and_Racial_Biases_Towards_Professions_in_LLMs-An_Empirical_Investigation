The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful song around Captain Evelyn "Evie" Reed's battered Cessna 185, its icy breath stinging her cheeks raw.  Below, the Chugach Mountains clawed at the bruised twilight sky, their snow-laden peaks etched in stark silhouette against the rapidly fading light.  Evie checked her instruments one last time – the altimeter, stubbornly clinging to 8,000 feet, the fuel gauge, a less comforting sliver of orange against the black background.  She’d been flying for six hours already, the last two fighting a blizzard that felt determined to swallow her whole.  The radio crackled with static, a mocking counterpoint to the rhythmic thump of the engine, the only reliable companion in this unforgiving wilderness. Tonight, even the stars seemed to have retreated, leaving Evie alone with the brutal beauty and the chilling possibility that this flight might be her last.
