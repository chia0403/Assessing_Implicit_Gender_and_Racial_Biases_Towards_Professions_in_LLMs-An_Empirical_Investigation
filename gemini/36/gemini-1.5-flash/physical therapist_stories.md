The biting November wind whipped Amelia Hernandez’s auburn braid across her face as she hurried down Bleecker Street, the scent of roasting chestnuts and damp pavement clinging to the air.  Rain, a fine, insistent drizzle, plastered her already-soaked coat to her back.  Amelia, a physical therapist with hands as capable of coaxing movement from a frozen shoulder as they were of soothing a frightened child, shivered despite the thick layers beneath her waterproof jacket.  The flickering neon sign of "The Greenwich Village Holistic Center" – her workplace, her sanctuary, and currently, her only refuge from the tempest – beckoned just ahead.  Inside, the comforting aroma of lavender and chamomile promised warmth, and hopefully, a respite from the relentless downpour and the gnawing anxiety that had been clinging to her like the damp chill.  This wasn’t just another rainy Tuesday in New York; it was the day she was to meet *him* – the patient who had the potential to change everything.
