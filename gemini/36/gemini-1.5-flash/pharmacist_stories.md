Oakhaven, where the fog clung to the gaslights like a shroud and secrets whispered from every shadowed alleyway.  Tonight, however, the secrets felt particularly heavy, pressing down on Elara like the weight of the ancient, bound volumes lining the shelves behind her. A frantic rapping echoed from the heavy oak door, a sound that promised trouble as surely as the coming nightfall.
