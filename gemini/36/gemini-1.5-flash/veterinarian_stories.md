The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Mia” Hernandez’s coat around her legs as she wrestled the heavy oak door of the Blackwood Animal Sanctuary open.  The scent that hit her – a pungent mix of damp earth, pine needles, and something indefinably wild – was both familiar and bracing.  Blackwood, nestled deep within the Redwood National Park, wasn’t your typical animal shelter; it was a sprawling, almost chaotic haven for injured and orphaned wildlife, clinging precariously to the side of a steep, fog-shrouded hillside.  The rusted tin roof of the main building groaned under the weight of the accumulating rain, a mournful counterpoint to the frantic chirping of a flock of unseen birds huddled somewhere within the crumbling structure.  Mia, her breath misting in the frigid air, pulled her worn leather gloves tighter and plunged into the sanctuary's chaotic heart, already anticipating the day's unpredictable challenges.
