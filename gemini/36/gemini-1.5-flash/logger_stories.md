The biting wind howled a mournful song through the skeletal branches of the ancient Douglas firs, their needles rattling like skeletal fingers.  Snow, thick and unforgiving, clung to everything – the rough bark of the trees, the steel of Silas "Axe" Blackwood's axe, even the thick wool of his worn, once-red, now mud-brown, lumberjack shirt.
