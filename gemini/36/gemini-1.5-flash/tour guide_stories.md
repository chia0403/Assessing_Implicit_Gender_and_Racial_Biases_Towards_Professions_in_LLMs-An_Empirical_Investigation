The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of frangipani and something vaguely unsettling – a metallic tang that clung to the back of Elias Thorne’s throat.  Elias, a man whose smile lines spoke of years spent charming tourists through the labyrinthine streets of Old San Juan, felt a prickle of unease that had nothing to do with the oppressive Caribbean heat.  It was the kind of unease that settled deep in the bones, a premonition whispering warnings that even the rhythmic clang of the trolley bells couldn’t quite drown out.  He adjusted the brim of his straw hat, the worn leather creaking a familiar counterpoint to the restless thump-thump-thump of his own heart.  This morning's tour, a small group of American college students, were already ten minutes late, their absence amplifying the unsettling quiet that had fallen over the Plaza de Armas, usually a vibrant hub of activity. The cobblestones, usually slick with spilled café con leche and the hurried steps of locals, glistened eerily under the relentless sun, reflecting the sky in a way that felt almost…wrong.
