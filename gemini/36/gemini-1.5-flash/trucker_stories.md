The biting Wyoming wind howled a mournful tune around Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins' rig, a song of ice and loneliness that mirrored the ache in his bones.  His eighteen-wheeler, a battered but loyal Kenworth he'd nicknamed "Betsy," groaned under the weight of a cargo of frozen beef, destined for a Chicago butcher shop.  The highway, I-80, stretched before him like a ribbon of black asphalt snaking through a landscape bleached white by a recent blizzard.  The only other visible signs of life were the distant, flickering lights of a lonely roadside diner, a beacon promising lukewarm coffee and greasy comfort, and the occasional, ghostly swirl of snow stirred by the relentless wind.  The temperature gauge in Betsy's cab read a teeth-chattering minus twenty, and Bart, despite his thick layers of wool and flannel, felt the cold seep into his very marrow.  He'd been on the road for three days, his usual jovial spirit worn thin by the relentless miles and the unforgiving weather. Tonight, however, felt different.  A deep, unsettling unease gnawed at him, heavier than the weight of Betsy's cargo.
