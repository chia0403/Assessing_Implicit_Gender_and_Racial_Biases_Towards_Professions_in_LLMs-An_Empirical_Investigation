The chipped paint of Amelia Katherine Blackwood’s writing desk flaked onto the worn Persian rug, a silent testament to the countless hours she’d spent hunched over it.  Rain lashed against the leaded-glass windows of her cottage, a relentless drumming that mirrored the tempest brewing inside her.

But tonight, even the comforting solidity of the stone felt flimsy, unable to shield Amelia from the gnawing self-doubt that threatened to consume her.  The manuscript, titled *The Obsidian Mirror*, lay open before her, its pages filled with elegant script, yet to Amelia, it felt like a collection of empty promises, a testament to her failing ambition.  The salty tang of the sea air, usually a source of inspiration, only served to amplify the desolate feeling that clung to her like sea mist.
