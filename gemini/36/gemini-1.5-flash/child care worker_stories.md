The chipped paint of the "Sunny Days Child Care" sign flaked onto the already-overgrown ivy clinging to the brick wall, a perfect metaphor for Elara Jeanine Mallory's Tuesday morning.  A biting November wind whipped across the small, neglected yard, scattering fallen leaves like discarded confetti across the patchy grass.  Inside, however, the air hung thick with the scent of cinnamon rolls (a desperate attempt at cheer from Elara herself) and the slightly sour tang of perpetually-wet toddler clothing.  The sound of tiny, insistent cries warbled in the background, a lullaby of chaos that was, to Elara, the familiar and comforting soundtrack of her day.
