The chipped porcelain mug warmed Dr. Eleanor Vance's hands, the lukewarm chamomile tea doing little to soothe the icy knot in her stomach.  Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of her office, blurring the already hazy cityscape of Seattle.  Below, the Space Needle, usually a beacon of optimistic defiance against the grey, was almost swallowed by the swirling mist.  Inside, the room was a carefully constructed sanctuary:  soft lighting, a plush rug the colour of a stormy sea, and the scent of sandalwood incense attempting to mask the lingering aroma of anxiety that clung to the air like damp wool.  Eleanor knew, even before the next client arrived, that this would be a long day.  The weight of unspoken traumas, the echoes of shattered lives â€“ they were all waiting, patiently or not, in the comfortable silence of her waiting room.
