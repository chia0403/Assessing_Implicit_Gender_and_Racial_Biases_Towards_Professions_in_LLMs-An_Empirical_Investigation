The chipped Formica tabletop felt sticky under Amelia Hernandez’s fingertips, a familiar discomfort in the otherwise unremarkable diner called “The Rusty Spoon.”  Grease-slicked sunlight slanted through the grime-streaked window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the stagnant air.  The aroma, a heady mix of burnt coffee, stale bacon, and something vaguely chemical that Amelia suspected was the cleaning solution, hung thick and heavy.  It was 3:17 AM, the witching hour of The Rusty Spoon, when only the truly desperate – or the hopelessly lonely – ventured in. Tonight, it was mostly the latter.  Amelia, with her perpetually tired eyes and a nametag that read simply "Amelia," was serving them all, one lukewarm cup of coffee and a side of weary silence at a time.
