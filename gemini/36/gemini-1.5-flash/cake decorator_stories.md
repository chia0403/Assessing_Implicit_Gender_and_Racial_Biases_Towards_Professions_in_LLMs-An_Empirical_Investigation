The air hung thick and sweet in the Sugarplum Bakery, a cloying perfume of vanilla bean, almond extract, and something faintly floral that Amelia Grace Hawthorne suspected was elderflower liqueur – a personal touch from Madame Evangeline, the bakery’s eccentric owner.  Amelia, a whirlwind of flour-dusted aprons and perfectly manicured fingernails, expertly swirled a rose-pink buttercream onto a three-tiered wedding cake, the intricate sugar-paste roses already meticulously arranged around its base. Outside, the relentless Chicago November wind howled a mournful tune against the frosted bakery windows, a stark contrast to the sugary paradise contained within.  The scent of impending snow mingled with the sugary aroma, a bittersweet foreshadowing of the day ahead.  For Amelia, it was the busiest day of the year, and not just because it was Thanksgiving weekend.  This cake, this magnificent, three-tiered testament to matrimonial bliss, was for the daughter of the city's most notoriously ruthless businessman, a man whose reputation was as icy as the approaching storm.
