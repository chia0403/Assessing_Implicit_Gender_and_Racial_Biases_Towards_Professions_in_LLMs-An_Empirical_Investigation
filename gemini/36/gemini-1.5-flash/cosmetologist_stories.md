The aroma of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a peculiar but familiar perfume to Seraphina “Sera” Dubois.  Sera, a cosmetologist with hands as nimble as a hummingbird’s wings and a heart as warm as a freshly baked croissant, surveyed her salon, "Shear Perfection," with a practiced eye.  Dust motes danced in the late afternoon sunbeams slanting through the tall, arched windows of the renovated Victorian building on Bleecker Street. Outside, the cacophony of New York City – honking taxis, chattering pedestrians, the distant wail of a siren – faded into a muted hum against the calming backdrop of soft jazz playing from hidden speakers.  The salon itself was a sanctuary of calm amidst the urban chaos, a haven of plush velvet armchairs, gleaming chrome tools, and the soft whisper of hair dryers.  Tonight, however, the usual tranquility was tinged with a nervous energy.  Sera glanced at the clock – six o'clock sharp.  Her most demanding, and most enigmatic, client was five minutes late.
