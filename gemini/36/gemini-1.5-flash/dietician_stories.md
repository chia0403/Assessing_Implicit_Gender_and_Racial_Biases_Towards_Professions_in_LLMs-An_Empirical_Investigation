The salt spray kissed Dr. Eleanor Vance's face as she navigated the rickety wooden pier, the scent of brine and decaying seaweed a familiar perfume in her seaside town of Port Blossom.  Grey skies hung low, mirroring the mood of the small, tightly-knit community she'd called home her entire life.  Port Blossom, nestled between a craggy coastline and a whispering pine forest, was a picturesque postcard, but beneath the surface of charming quaintness simmered a long-standing battle against poor health and ingrained dietary habits.  Eleanor, a registered dietician with a PhD in nutritional science, found herself caught in the middle, wrestling not only with stubborn cholesterol levels and blood sugar spikes, but with the stubbornness of tradition itself.  The upcoming annual fishing festival loomed, a celebration of Port Blossom's heritage, but also a four-day feast of fried fish, creamy chowders, and enough butter to clog a whale's arteries.  This year, Eleanor Vance was determined to make a change.
