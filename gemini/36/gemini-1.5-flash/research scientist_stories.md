The biting Antarctic wind howled a mournful song around Dr. Eleanor Vanceâ€™s research station, a desolate symphony punctuated only by the rhythmic crackle of the radio and the occasional, unnerving groan of the ice itself.

This was no ordinary research expedition; the discovery she sought, buried beneath millennia of ice and snow, held the potential to rewrite the history of humankind, or perhaps, erase it entirely.
