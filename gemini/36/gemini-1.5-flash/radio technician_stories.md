The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face as he wrestled the recalcitrant antenna cable.  Below him, the churning grey expanse of the North Sea roared its disapproval of the late-October gale.  He clung precariously to the rusted scaffolding of the Grimsby Headland radio mast, the wind a howling banshee threatening to tear him from his perch.  His fingers, numb and clumsy with cold, fumbled with the corroded connectors, the rhythmic crackle of the static in his headset a counterpoint to the storm's fury.  The aging radio station, a skeletal behemoth perched on the cliff's edge, creaked and groaned around him like an ancient, arthritic beast, its metal bones groaning under the strain.  This wasn't just a job; it was a battle against the elements, a lonely vigil against the vast, unforgiving ocean.  Tonight, the stakes were higher than usual.  A distress call, faint and fractured, had sliced through the static, a desperate plea swallowed by the storm. Elias, the station's sole radio technician, was their last hope.
