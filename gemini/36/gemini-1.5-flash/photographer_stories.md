The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face, a familiar kiss from the unforgiving Atlantic.  He braced himself against the relentless wind that howled across the desolate cliffs of Slieve League, the grey stone a stark backdrop to the churning, tempestuous sea below.

His battered Nikon D850, wrapped in a waterproof bag, felt reassuringly heavy in his hand, a familiar weight against the wildness of the landscape.  Today, however, Elias wasn't just chasing the perfect shot; he was chasing something far more elusive – the ghost of a memory, a faded photograph he’d found tucked away in his grandmother's attic, a picture hinting at a family secret lost to the waves of time.
