The gaslights, flickering weakly against the gloom, cast long, distorted shadows that danced and writhed like restless spirits around the imposing stone buildings that lined the street – silent witnesses to centuries of Glasgow's history, secrets whispered on the wind.  Tonight, Amelia sensed, those secrets were about to be unveiled.
