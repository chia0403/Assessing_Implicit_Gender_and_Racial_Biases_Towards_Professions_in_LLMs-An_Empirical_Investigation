The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face as he wrestled the unwieldy coil of marine-grade cable onto the deck of the *Seraphina*.  The fishing trawler, a battered veteran of countless storms, groaned and creaked around him like a dying beast, its paint peeling in sun-bleached strips, its rusted hull a testament to years spent battling the unforgiving North Sea.  The air hung thick with the smell of diesel, fish guts, and the bracing tang of the ocean â€“ a smell Elias, a journeyman electrician specializing in maritime repairs, knew intimately.  The grey sky threatened rain, mirroring the grim expression on Captain Bjorn Hansen's face, perched precariously on the edge of the wheelhouse, watching Elias's struggle with a mixture of impatience and apprehension.  This wasn't just a routine electrical fault; the *Seraphina's* navigational system was down, and the storm brewing out on the horizon was far from benign.
