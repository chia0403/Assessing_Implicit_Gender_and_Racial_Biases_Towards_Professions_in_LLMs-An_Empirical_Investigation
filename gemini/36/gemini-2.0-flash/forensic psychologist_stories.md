## Story Opening:

The scent of decay was a thick, unwelcome blanket draped over the crisp October air. Dr. Evelyn Reed, forensic psychologist, pulled her scarf tighter, the wool doing little to ward off the pervasive chill that seeped into her bones. She'd been to countless crime scenes in her fifteen years, each one a unique tableau of human tragedy, but something about this one felt different. Moreâ€¦ personal.

The yellow tape, stretched haphazardly between skeletal trees, marked the perimeter of the woodland. The leaves, once vibrant crimson and gold, were now a sodden mess underfoot, clinging to her boots like desperate mourners. The setting sun cast long, skeletal shadows, painting the scene in hues of somber grey and bruised purple. A single, bare branch scraped rhythmically against the window of the abandoned cabin, a chilling metronome marking the passing of time and the fading of hope. Evelyn had a sinking feeling this was going to be a long night.
## Setting:

**Location:** A heavily wooded area just outside the small, isolated town of Havenwood, Pennsylvania. The center of the scene is an abandoned, one-room hunting cabin, seemingly untouched for decades. The cabin sits nestled in a small clearing, surrounded by dense forest.

**Time:** Late October, just before sunset. The air is crisp and cold, with a hint of dampness. The sky is overcast, adding to the overall sense of gloom.

**Atmosphere:** Ominous, melancholic, and isolated. The decaying leaves, skeletal trees, and crumbling cabin walls contribute to a feeling of decay and abandonment. The scene is unsettlingly quiet, punctuated only by the rustling of leaves and the creaking of the cabin.
