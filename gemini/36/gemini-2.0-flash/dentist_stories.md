The insistent hum of the drill vibrated through Dr. Eleanor Victoria Ainsworth's hand, a familiar counterpoint to the jazz softly spilling from the speakers overhead. Outside, the late afternoon sun was painting the cobblestones of Beacon Hill a warm, amber hue, making the Boston brownstones across the narrow street glow. Inside, however, Eleanor was focused on the cavernous maw before her, illuminated by the unforgiving glare of the surgical light. 

Mrs. Higgins, her patient, was snoring lightly, a testament to the combined effects of nitrous oxide and the steady rhythm of Eleanor's work. Eleanor adjusted her mask, pushing back a stray wisp of her auburn hair that had escaped her surgical cap. This was her sanctuary, her domain. The sterile scent of disinfectant, the soft clinking of instruments, the focused precision required for each procedure â€“ it all soothed her. Here, in her meticulously organized office at Ainsworth Dental, surrounded by certificates of achievement and framed photographs of beaming, healthy smiles, Eleanor felt like she had finally carved out a space where she belonged. A space where she could control the chaos, one molar at a time.
