Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring an accountant named...

**Story Opening:**

The rhythmic clack of keyboard keys was a strange lullaby in the otherwise silent office.  Arthur Penhaligon, his tie loosened and perched precariously on his hunched shoulders, squinted at the glowing screen. Another spreadsheet, another stack of invoices, another set of numbers threatening to bleed into each other.  He rubbed his tired eyes with the heels of his palms, a habit he'd developed sometime after his third cup of lukewarm coffee that day.  The midnight oil had long since burned out; he was running solely on the faint flickering hope that he'd find the discrepancy before 3:00 AM.  A discrepancy that, according to Mr. Henderson's shrill, pre-departure voicemail, could "potentially bankrupt the entire bloody operation!" Arthur sighed, the sound a puff of weary resignation in the stale air. He was, after all, just an accountant.  He crunched numbers, didn't he? He didn't perform miracles.  Or did he? He felt the sweat gathering on his forehead. Tonight, it seemed, might require divine intervention, or at least, a very strong cup of tea.

**Setting:**

The setting is the sparsely decorated office of a mid-sized import-export company called "Global Ventures Inc.," located on the fifth floor of a somewhat dilapidated office building in a slightly-past-its-prime industrial park on the outskirts of Cleveland, Ohio. The office itself is functional but uninspired, filled with gray cubicles, fluorescent lighting that hums incessantly, and the general air of quiet desperation that permeates most workplaces after regular business hours. Arthur's cubicle is identifiable only by the slightly askew photograph of a blurry golden retriever, presumably his own, taped to one side, and a ceramic mug declaring him the "World's Okayest Accountant."  Outside the large, grimy window, the blinking lights of a nearby truck stop provide the only real visual stimulation amidst the inky blackness of the Ohio night. You can smell the faint aroma of day-old coffee and the underlying tang of cheap industrial carpet cleaner.
