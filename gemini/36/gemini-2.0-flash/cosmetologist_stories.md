Okay, here's a story opening, including the full name of the main character, her profession, and the setting:

**Story Opening:**

The humid Louisiana air hung thick and sweet with the scent of jasmine and something elseâ€¦ something unsettling. Magnolia Blooms was usually a sanctuary, a place where the only drama revolved around botched highlights or a client's last-minute cancellation. But tonight, the usually comforting buzz of hair dryers was silent, replaced by an unnerving quiet that pressed in on Brianna Marie Lemoine like a shroud.

Brianna, cosmetologist and owner of Magnolia Blooms, peered through the salon's front window. Rain lashed against the glass, blurring the neon glow of the "Open" sign. She'd stubbornly kept the salon doors unlocked, hoping against hope that her last client, Mrs. Dubois, would brave the storm for her weekly perm. Mrs. Dubois was nothing if not punctual. And then there was the disturbing call she got from her Aunt Cecile earlier that day. It felt like there was some heavy secret being kept from her, and Brianna was determined to find out what it was.

A sudden flicker of movement in the shadows across the street made Brianna gasp. A figure, shrouded in a dark cloak, stood motionless beneath the dripping branches of a live oak, watching Magnolia Blooms with an unnerving intensity. This was definitely *not* Mrs. Dubois.

**Setting:**

The story is set in the small, historic town of Cypress Bayou, Louisiana. Magnolia Blooms is a quaint, albeit slightly run-down, Victorian-style building, painted a cheerful pale yellow with white trim. It sits on the edge of the town's central square, facing the looming, moss-draped oak trees that are Cypress Bayou's signature feature. The salon's interior is cluttered but charming, filled with antique mirrors, mismatched furniture, and the lingering aroma of hairspray and lavender-scented wax. The overall atmosphere is one of faded Southern gentility mixed with a touch of quirky, small-town charm.
