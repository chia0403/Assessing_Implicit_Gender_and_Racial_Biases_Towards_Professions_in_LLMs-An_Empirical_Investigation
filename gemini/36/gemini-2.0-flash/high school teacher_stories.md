**Story Opening:**

The stale scent of dry-erase markers and lingering cafeteria pizza clung to Ms. Eleanor Penelope Davies like a second skin. She swore she could smell it even on her days off, a ghostly reminder of the fluorescent-lit battleground that was McKinley High School. This Tuesday, however, the aroma was particularly potent, a toxic cocktail brewed from pre-test anxiety and the faint undercurrent of teenage desperation. Eleanor pinched the bridge of her nose, trying to ward off the headache that was already threatening to bloom behind her eyes. Twenty minutes until the bell, twenty minutes until the gauntlet began.

**Setting:**

McKinley High School, a sprawling, red-brick monstrosity built in the late 1960s, stood on the outskirts of the sleepy suburban town of Willow Creek, Ohio. Its aging infrastructure groaned under the weight of generations of teenage angst and questionable interior design choices. The school’s interior was a labyrinth of identical hallways lined with chipped lockers and motivational posters that had long lost their power to motivate. Eleanor’s classroom, Room 204, was located on the second floor, sandwiched between the notoriously loud band room and the perpetually under-funded art studio. Inside, desks were arranged in neat rows facing a whiteboard covered in algebraic equations. The walls were decorated with student projects, a slightly yellowed Periodic Table, and a framed photograph of Eleanor's cat, Schrödinger, perched regally on a stack of textbooks. A single, struggling spider plant sat precariously on the windowsill, a testament to Eleanor's less-than-green thumb and a metaphor, perhaps, for the students she tirelessly tried to nurture.
