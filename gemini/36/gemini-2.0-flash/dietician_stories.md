**Setting:** The perpetually overcast city of Seattle, Washington. Late October. The air is crisp and damp, smelling of wet leaves and the faint, metallic tang of the Puget Sound. Steam curls from coffee cups gripped by commuters rushing along the cobblestone streets of Pioneer Square. The offices above the ground-floor shops are a mix of polished modern glass and crumbling Victorian brick, a testament to the city's evolving identity.

**Story Opening:**

The ring of the antique telephone on her desk nearly made Eleanor Ainsworth jump out of her skin. The sound, jarringly out of place in her minimalist, Scandinavian-inspired office, always did. She hated the thing, a relic from the building's previous tenant, a semi-successful psychic named Madame Evangeline. Eleanor kept it plugged in only because her landlord, a quirky man with a penchant for the theatrical, insisted it was "part of the building's charm."

Taking a deep breath and mentally preparing herself for another wrong number or a particularly persistent telemarketer selling dubious weight loss supplements, Eleanor reached for the receiver. "Eleanor Ainsworth, Registered Dietician," she announced, her voice a carefully modulated blend of professional warmth and cautious optimism.

A raspy voice, laced with the unmistakable desperation of someone whoâ€™d seen far too much hardship, crackled in her ear. "Eleanor Ainsworth," the voice repeated, the words thick with a Slavic accent. "They said you could help." Before Eleanor could respond, the line went dead. Just like that. A dial tone hummed in her ear, as cold and unsettling as the Seattle rain drumming against the window.
