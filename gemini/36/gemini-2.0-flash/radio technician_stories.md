## Story Opening:

The high-pitched whine was back, slicing through Amelia Hayes' headphones like a rogue dentist drill. She slammed a fist against the side of the aging transmitter, its metallic skin cold under her hand. "Damn it, Percy," she muttered, her breath misting in the pre-dawn chill. "Just when you think you've got a handle on things, you go and throw a tantrum."

**Setting:**

The setting is the small, isolated coastal town of Port Blossom, Maine, in the year 1957. Amelia Hayes works as the sole radio technician and announcer for the local radio station, WBLM, located on the top floor of the town's abandoned lighthouse. The lighthouse itself, a grand yet crumbling structure, stands sentinel at the edge of the rugged, windswept coastline. Inside, the station is a cramped, cluttered space dominated by hulking radio equipment, wires snaking across the floor like metallic vines. The walls are painted a chipped, faded green, and the air hangs thick with the scent of dust, ozone, and the faint, lingering smell of seaweed carried in by the relentless sea breeze. Outside, the town is shrouded in the misty, pre-dawn darkness, punctuated only by the rhythmic sweep of the lighthouse beam and the mournful cry of distant gulls.
