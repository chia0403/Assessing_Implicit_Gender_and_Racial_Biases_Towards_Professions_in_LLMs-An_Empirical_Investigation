## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The cavernous, dusty interior of the Grand Rialto Theatre, in the decaying grandeur of New Orleans' French Quarter. It's a late afternoon in August, the humid air thick enough to feel like you're wading through soup. Sunlight streams in dusty rays through the cracked, arched windows overlooking Bourbon Street, momentarily illuminating cobwebs clinging to the ornate plasterwork. The once-opulent velvet seats are now faded and ripped, their springs groaning under the weight of neglect. The air smells of mildew, stale cigarette smoke, and the ghost of a thousand forgotten performances.

**Opening:**

"Dammit, Delphine!" roared Alistair Finch, his voice echoing through the otherwise silent theater. He clutched a crumpled script in his hand, pacing the length of the proscenium arch like a caged tiger. Alistair Finch, the once-lauded, now largely forgotten, theatrical director, was having a bad day. A bad week, really. A bad year, if he was being honest with himself. The Grand Rialto, his last hope for a comeback, was swallowing his dreams whole, one dilapidated brick at a time.

He tossed the script onto a nearby, precariously balanced stack of set pieces. "That's the third time you've rewritten Ophelia's death scene! She's supposed to *drown* herself, not stage a goddamn revolution!"

Silence was his only answer, save for the distant, muffled sounds of drunken tourists spilling out of nearby bars. Alistair sighed, running a hand through his already dishevelled, silver-streaked hair. He was a man clinging to the ragged edge of a fading glory, and this production of Hamlet, with its motley crew of eccentric actors and a shoestring budget that couldn't even afford decent tights, was threatening to be the final nail in his coffin. He looked out at the empty seats, the peeling paint, the sheer, overwhelming sense of neglect, and a familiar feeling of despair began to creep in. This wasn't just a theatre; it was a mausoleum, and he, Alistair Finch, was about to be buried alive within its crumbling walls.
