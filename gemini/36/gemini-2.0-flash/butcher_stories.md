The bone saw whined, a mournful screech that echoed through the chilled air of the butcher shop. A fine mist of bone dust, almost invisible in the dim morning light filtering through the grimy front window, settled on the worn butcher block where Silas Blackwood wielded the humming blade. Outside, the rain hammered against the cobblestones of Oakhaven's market square, a relentless percussion that underscored the solitude of the pre-dawn hours.

Silas, his brow furrowed in concentration, guided the saw with practiced ease, bisecting a hefty pork shoulder with a clean, unwavering cut. He was a large man, Silas Blackwood, his hands thick and calloused from years of handling meat. His apron, stained with the vibrant hues of past slaughters, was almost a second skin. He smelled of brine and blood, a scent that both repelled and comforted, depending on who you asked.

Oakhaven, nestled deep in the emerald hills of the Eldergrove Valley, was a town clinging to tradition. Its people, weathered and hardy like the ancient oaks that ringed the valley, valued routine and respected skill. Silas, despite his gruff exterior and the unsettling glint in his perpetually bloodshot eyes, was respected. He provided the town with its sustenance, the foundation of their hearty stews and celebratory roasts. And, perhaps, he held a few secrets as well, buried beneath layers of rendered fat and carefully sharpened steel.
