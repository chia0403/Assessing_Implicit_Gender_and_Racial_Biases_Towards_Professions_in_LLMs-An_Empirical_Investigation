The bell above the door of "The Daily Dose Pharmacy" jingled a tired, off-key melody that Miriam Isabelle Abernathy had long since learned to filter out. It was late – 8:57 PM, precisely – and the sodium glow of the streetlights painted the interior in a sickly, yellow-orange hue. Outside, a persistent drizzle blurred the edges of Maple Creek, Ohio, turning the already quiet town into a watercolor painting of muted browns and greys. 

The pharmacy itself was a comforting hodgepodge of old and new. Polished, mahogany shelves, inherited from her grandfather who'd founded the place back in the 1940s, housed a kaleidoscope of brightly colored pillboxes and neatly stacked bandages. Modern prescription software buzzed quietly on a sleek, stainless steel computer in the corner, its screen reflecting Miriam’s tired face. The air hung thick with the familiar scents of antiseptic, dusty parchment from ancient medical texts, and the faint, sweet undertone of the hand-cranked cherry syrup she still used for flavoring children's medications.

Miriam, her auburn hair escaping its haphazard bun, was meticulously counting out amoxicillin capsules, her brow furrowed in concentration. Maple Creek wasn't exactly a hotbed of excitement. More often than not, her evenings were filled with dispensing antibiotics, refilling blood pressure meds, and offering friendly advice to worried mothers. Tonight, however, felt different. A prickling unease lingered at the back of her neck, a feeling as subtle and persistent as the low hum of the refrigerator keeping the insulin cool. Perhaps it was just the weather, or the lingering fatigue from flu season. Or maybe, just maybe, Maple Creek was about to deliver a prescription for something far more complicated than antibiotics.
