## Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

The asphalt was screaming. Not literally, of course, but that's what it sounded like to Robert "Bobby" James Kincaid after ten hours of jackhammering under the relentless Georgia sun. Sweat dripped from his brow, stinging his eyes, and he wiped it away with a dirt-stained forearm, leaving a streak of grime across his forehead. The vibrations still hummed in his bones, a persistent, irritating tremor that even a cold beer and a long shower couldn't fully shake off. He watched as the last rays of the setting sun painted the clouds in hues of orange and purple, a beautiful spectacle completely lost on him. Another day closer to retirement, another day further away from the man he used to be.

**Setting:**

The year is 2023. The setting is a section of Interstate 75 just south of Macon, Georgia. The highway is undergoing extensive repairs, with a large crew working to repave a particularly damaged stretch of the southbound lanes. The air is thick with humidity and the smell of hot asphalt and diesel fumes. Traffic crawls by in the adjacent lane, a steady stream of trucks and cars, their occupants oblivious to the backbreaking labor happening just inches away. Cones and barricades create a narrow work zone, a fragile barrier between the workers and the constant threat of speeding vehicles. The surrounding landscape is a blur of scrub pines, kudzu-covered embankments, and faded billboards advertising everything from discount tires to religious revivals. The rhythmic drone of crickets fills the air as dusk descends, a stark contrast to the cacophony of construction that dominated the day. The small, dusty crew office, a temporary trailer parked on the shoulder, serves as a meager oasis amidst the chaos, offering a respite of lukewarm water and questionable coffee.
