The biting February wind, a razor against exposed skin, had no respect for occupational hazards. It whipped around Archibald "Archie" Fairbanks, stinging his cheeks and tugging insistently at the brim of his worn-out baseball cap, emblazoned with the faded logo of "Fairbanks Roofing: Integrity Above All." Archie cursed under his breath, readjusting his grip on the bundle of asphalt shingles. He wasn't built for this kind of weather. He was a summer man, a creature of sunshine and easy sweat, not this bone-chilling damp that seeped into your very soul.

He was perched precariously on the steeply-pitched roof of 22 Sycamore Lane, a rambling Victorian house overlooking the town square of Havenwood, Pennsylvania. Havenwood was the kind of place where people still baked cookies for their neighbors and left their doors unlocked (or at least, they used to, before the unfortunate incident with Mrs. Henderson's prized petunias and the suspiciously shifty-eyed teenage boys). The house itself was all gables and gingerbread trim, painted in a slightly-too-bright shade of robin's egg blue that jarred against the gray sky. It belonged to Mrs. Penelope Hawthorne, a woman known as much for her eccentric hats as she was for her generosity to the local animal shelter. 

Archie had been summoned to fix a leak that, according to Mrs. Hawthorne, was "a direct result of the mischievous sprites that plagued her attic." Archie, a pragmatist if nothing else, suspected squirrels. He'd dealt with enough squirrel-induced roofing damage to fill a small encyclopedia. But he wasn't one to argue with a paying customer, especially one who promised him hot cocoa with marshmallows upon completion of the job. Right now, as the wind threatened to send him tumbling off the edge, that cocoa was looking mighty tempting.
