The antique clock in the hallway chimed a mournful, echoing twelve, its bronze pendulum swinging with the slow deliberation of an aging dowager. Elara Beatrice Hawthorne, the housekeeper of Blackwood Manor for the past twenty years, sighed, the sound a soft rustle against the oppressive silence of the house. She paused in the dusting of a particularly grotesque gargoyle – one of dozens that lined the gallery, their stony visages seemingly mocking her – and rubbed the small of her back. At forty-eight, Elara was starting to feel the weight of Blackwood, both literally and figuratively.

Blackwood Manor wasn't just old; it was an institution, a testament to generations of the Blackwood family, each member leaving their indelible, and often unsettling, mark on the estate. Nestled deep within the sprawling, untamed moorland of Yorkshire, England, the manor was a labyrinth of dimly lit corridors, echoing halls, and rooms overflowing with dusty relics. Rain lashed perpetually against the leaded windows, and the wind howled a mournful song that seemed to seep into the very stones of the building, clinging to Elara's clothes like a persistent shadow.

Mr. Alistair Blackwood, the current Lord of the manor, was a recluse, a man consumed by his research in the decaying library, rarely venturing beyond its mahogany-paneled walls. He was a ghost in his own house, and Elara often wondered if he even remembered she was there. This suited Elara just fine, usually. Solitude was a balm, a refuge from the gossip and petty dramas of the nearby village of Grimshaw. But lately, an unsettling feeling had taken root in the pit of her stomach, a sense of unease that went beyond the usual dampness and decay of Blackwood Manor. Something was different, something felt…wrong. And the gargoyles, with their silent, watchful eyes, seemed to know exactly what it was.
