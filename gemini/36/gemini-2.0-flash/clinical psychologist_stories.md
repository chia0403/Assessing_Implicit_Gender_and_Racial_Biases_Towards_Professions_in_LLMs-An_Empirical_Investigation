## Story Opening:

The insistent buzzing of the intercom yanked Dr. Evelyn Reed, her fingers still stained faintly with the remnants of last night's Merlot, from the half-formed dream of chasing butterflies in a field of electric-blue corn. She groaned, the sound muffled by the plush armrest of her well-worn, oxblood leather armchair. "Yes, Brenda?" she croaked, her voice thick with sleep.

"Dr. Reed," Brenda's crisp, slightly impatient voice crackled through the speaker, "Mr. Henderson is here. He's… agitated."

Evelyn sighed. "Agitated how? Throwing furniture agitated, or just tapping-his-foot-and-threatening-to-sue-me agitated?"

Brenda hesitated. "Somewhere in between, I think. He's holding a rather large, intricately carved wooden box, and he keeps muttering about… whispering shadows."

Evelyn ran a hand through her unruly, salt-and-pepper hair. Whispering shadows, huh? Just another Tuesday at the office. "Alright, Brenda. Send him in. And maybe put on a pot of that Earl Grey. Strong. I think I'm going to need it."

## Setting:

The office of Dr. Evelyn Reed was a sanctuary carved out of a bustling, impersonal city. Located on the fifth floor of a pre-war building in the West Village, it was a space that spoke of both professionalism and comfort. The walls were painted a calming shade of sage green, punctuated by framed, vintage botanical prints. A thick Persian rug, its vibrant patterns faded with age, covered most of the polished hardwood floor.

Sunlight streamed through the large, arched windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and casting warm shadows across the room. The centerpiece was, undoubtedly, the aforementioned oxblood leather armchair, strategically positioned to face a comfortable, yet slightly worn, loveseat. Between them sat a low, mahogany coffee table piled high with psychology journals, dog-eared paperbacks on Jungian archetypes, and a haphazard stack of patient files.

A tall, overflowing bookshelf dominated one wall, its shelves groaning under the weight of both academic texts and well-loved novels. On another wall hung Evelyn's diploma from Yale, a subtle reminder of her credentials, balanced by a collection of quirky, hand-painted masks she'd collected during her travels. The overall effect was a carefully curated space designed to put patients at ease, a place where the anxieties and secrets of the human mind could be safely explored. But today, with the promise of agitated Mr. Henderson and his whispering shadows, Evelyn wondered if even her meticulously crafted haven would be enough.
