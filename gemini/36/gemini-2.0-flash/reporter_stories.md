## Story Opening:

The metallic tang of burnt coffee clung to the air inside The Daily Standard, a smell Beatrice Eleanor Ainsworth had come to associate with breaking news and crippling deadlines. Tonight, it was both. Her fingers, stained with newsprint and nicotine, flew across the keyboard, chasing the fleeting whispers of a scandal that could bring down half the city council.

"Damn it!" she hissed, backspacing furiously. "Too sensational. Needs moreâ€¦ meat."

Beatrice, a woman who valued accuracy above all else, even a good headline, took a long drag from her cigarette, the cherry glowing like a defiant ember in the gloom of her cubicle. The city was holding its breath, waiting for the truth, and she was determined to deliver it, even if it meant pulling another all-nighter fuelled by lukewarm coffee and the desperate hope of a scoop.

## Setting:

The Daily Standard occupies the third floor of a dilapidated art deco building on the edge of downtown Oakhaven, a city steeped in history and shrouded in secrets. The newsroom is a chaotic landscape of overflowing inboxes, stacks of newspapers dating back decades (Beatrice's personal archive), and the constant hum of outdated computers struggling to keep up with the 21st century. Fluorescent lights buzz overhead, casting a harsh, unflattering glow on the faces of exhausted reporters and editors. The windows, grimy with years of accumulated grime, offer a distorted view of the city below: the glittering skyscrapers of the financial district juxtaposed with the decaying brick buildings of the historic wharf, a stark reminder of Oakhaven's uneven prosperity and its simmering undercurrents. The aroma of stale pizza, cheap cologne, and desperation hangs heavy in the air, a potent cocktail that defines the life of a reporter at The Daily Standard.
