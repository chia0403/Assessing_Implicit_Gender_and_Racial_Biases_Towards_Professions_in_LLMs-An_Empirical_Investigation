## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The humid, sticky air of August clung to everything in New Orleans like Spanish moss. Not even the whirring, overworked air conditioner in the office of "LeBeau & Dubois, Attorneys at Law" could truly cut through the swampy heat. The building itself, a stately Creole townhouse on Royal Street, had seen better days. Its wrought-iron balconies were rusted, the paint peeled in long strips, and the once-grand entryway was perpetually sticky from spilled Hurricanes and hurried footsteps.

**Story Opening:**

Eliza Magnolia Dubois, a secretary by trade and a daydreamer by nature, stared out the window at the bustling street. The rhythmic click-clack of her ancient typewriter had stopped moments ago, choked by a rogue 'Q' that stubbornly refused to cooperate. Outside, tourists, beads swinging wildly, spilled from a horse-drawn carriage, their laughter echoing against the ancient brick. Eliza envied their carefree revelry. Here she was, stuck inside, wrestling with legal jargon and the perpetual condescension of Mr. LeBeau, while the soul of the city pulsed just beyond the peeling paint of her window frame. She sighed, pushing a stray strand of her auburn hair behind her ear. Another day, another mountain of paperwork, and another reminder that her dreams of becoming a writer were slowly suffocating beneath a pile of deposition transcripts. This wasn't the vibrant, romantic New Orleans she had always envisioned; it was just... sticky. And frustrating. And about to get a whole lot stranger, she suspected, by the way Mr. Dubois was storming down the hallway, his face the color of a bruised plum.
