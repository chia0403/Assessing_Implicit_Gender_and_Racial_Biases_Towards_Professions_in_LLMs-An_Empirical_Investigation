## The Story Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

The scent of lavender and disappointment clung to Amelia Grace Harper like the steam from her towel warmer. Rain lashed against the panoramic window of her studio, blurring the already indistinct neon glow of the city below. Another cancellation. That made three today. Sighing, Amelia massaged the knot forming between her eyebrows – a cruel irony considering her profession – and glanced at the clock. 6:47 PM. Prime time. The time when stressed-out executives and weary mothers supposedly flocked to her sanctuary for relief. Tonight, however, the only relief she found was in the stillness of the empty room.

**Setting:**

Amelia's studio, "Serenity Now," occupies the fifteenth floor of a sleek, modern building in downtown Seattle. While the exterior is all glass and steel, Amelia has worked hard to create a calming oasis within. Soft, earth-toned walls are adorned with abstract paintings in muted blues and greens. A small, trickling fountain gurgles peacefully in the corner, its smooth stones worn smooth by years of filtered water. The centerpiece of the room is, of course, the massage table, draped in plush, ecru linens and warmed to a comforting temperature. Subtle lighting emanates from salt lamps scattered throughout the room, casting a warm, inviting glow. Despite the rain pounding against the windows, the studio strives for a feeling of enclosed tranquility, a world away from the hustle and bustle of the city below. However, lately, it feels less like a haven and more like an expensive, echoing tomb.
