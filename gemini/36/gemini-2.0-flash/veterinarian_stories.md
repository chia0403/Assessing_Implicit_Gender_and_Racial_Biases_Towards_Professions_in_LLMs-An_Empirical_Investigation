## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The biting wind whipped off the Puget Sound, carrying the scent of salt and decaying seaweed. Grey clouds hung low over Whidbey Island, mirroring the choppy, steel-colored water. The town of Langley, a picturesque collection of weathered cedar buildings clinging to a bluff, seemed to huddle against the onslaught of the late November storm. Inside Langley Veterinary Clinic, however, a warm glow emanated from the front windows, promising a haven from the relentless elements. The clinic, a converted Victorian house, was cozy and smelled of disinfectant, wet dog, and a faint, lingering aroma of freshly brewed coffee.

**Opening:** Dr. Eleanor Josephine Vance stared out the rain-streaked window, the condensation blurring the already bleak landscape. Her hands, roughened from years of handling animals both big and small, massaged her temples, trying to ward off the impending headache. The storm had knocked out power to half the island, and while her backup generator was humming merrily, keeping the lights and vital equipment running, it also added a layer of mechanical drone to the already stressful atmosphere. The day had been a relentless parade of sick cats, limping dogs, and one particularly stubborn pygmy goat with a penchant for chewing through IV lines. Now, just as she was about to lock up and retreat to the quiet sanctuary of her cottage overlooking Saratoga Passage, the clinic phone rang, its shrill tone cutting through the relative calm. Eleanor sighed, pushing herself away from the window. Another emergency, undoubtedly. This was life as a veterinarian on a remote island; never a dull moment, and rarely a quiet one.
