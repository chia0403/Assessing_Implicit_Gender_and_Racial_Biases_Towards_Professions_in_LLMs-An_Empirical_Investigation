## Story Opening:

The scent of sandalwood and shaving soap hung thick in the air, a comforting aroma that had permeated every fiber of Alistair Finch's being. Outside, the relentless Manchester drizzle hammered against the shop window, blurring the already indistinct world into a watercolour of greys. Inside, Alistair surveyed his domain: Finch's Fine Fades, a sanctuary of masculine grooming nestled in a quiet corner of Ancoats. The red leather barber chair, a relic salvaged from his grandfather's shop, gleamed under the warm glow of the antique lamps. A meticulously arranged collection of straight razors, honing steels, and pomade tins lined the shelves behind him, each item a testament to the time and care he poured into his craft.

Alistair smoothed down his meticulously trimmed mustache, its waxed tips curving upwards in a perpetual, slightly sardonic smile. He hadn't had a customer all morning. The rain, no doubt. Or perhaps the rumors. Whatever the reason, the quiet hum of the fluorescent bulb felt louder than usual, a stark contrast to the rhythmic snip-snip-snip he usually wielded, transforming unruly locks into works of art. He sighed, the sound lost in the low rumble of a jazz record spinning on the gramophone tucked away in the corner. He hoped Mr. Henderson would brave the weather. He was due for his weekly trim and, more importantly, his weekly dose of Alistair's dry wit.

## Setting:

**Finch's Fine Fades** is a small, traditional barber shop located in the **Ancoats** neighbourhood of **Manchester, England**. It is owned and operated by **Alistair Finch**.

*   **Exterior:** The shop front is a faded burgundy colour, with a large, clear window showcasing the interior. A traditional barber's pole, albeit slightly chipped and weather-beaten, stands proudly beside the door. The address, 32 Bradbury Street, is painted in gold leaf above the window.

*   **Interior:** The interior is meticulously clean and well-maintained, with a vintage aesthetic. Dark wood panelling lines the lower half of the walls, topped with a lighter, cream-coloured paint. The red leather barber chair is the focal point, surrounded by antique mirrors, framed photographs of stylish haircuts from decades past, and shelves stocked with grooming products. A gramophone sits in a corner, playing a selection of jazz and blues records. The air is always filled with the distinct scent of sandalwood, shaving soap, and a hint of aftershave.
