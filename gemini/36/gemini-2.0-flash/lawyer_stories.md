The hum of the fluorescent lights in the holding cell seemed to vibrate right through Amelia Isabelle Harrington's skull. It was a particularly offensive buzz, a high-pitched whine that mirrored the anxiety clawing at her insides. Outside, rain hammered against the reinforced glass, mimicking the rhythmic thudding of her heartbeat. She knew, intellectually, that the downpour was a welcome drought-breaker after weeks of relentless heat. But right now, it just amplified the grimy, claustrophobic atmosphere of the precinct lockup.

Amelia, a seasoned criminal defense lawyer, had seen worse, of course. Far worse. But the situation this time was different. This time, it wasn't just a client on the other side of the bars. This time, it was her brother.

The setting was the dimly lit, perpetually damp holding cell #3 in the 14th Precinct of the Boston Police Department, nestled in the gritty heart of South Boston. The air reeked of stale coffee, disinfectant, and despair - a potent cocktail that Amelia had grown intimately familiar with over her fifteen years practicing law. The chipped, grey paint of the cell walls was scrawled with faded graffiti â€“ gang signs, declarations of undying (and usually misspelled) love, and the occasional crude drawing. A single, steel bench bolted to the floor offered the only seating. The only concession to comfort was the thin, grey blanket folded on top of it, looking more like a surrendered flag than a source of warmth.

Tonight, this bleak, forgotten corner of the justice system was Amelia's battleground. And the opponent, as always, was time.
