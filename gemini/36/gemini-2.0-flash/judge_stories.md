Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a judge named:

**Full Name:**  Honorable Theodora Beatrice Ainsworth

**Setting:** The story opens on a crisp, late-October morning in the sleepy, somewhat forgotten town of Havenwood, Massachusetts. Havenwood, population dwindling to a precarious 1,800, clung to the edge of the Berkshire Mountains, a place where the leaves turned a vibrant, almost aggressively cheerful red and gold before surrendering to the inevitable grey of winter. The town square, anchored by a weathered, Revolutionary War-era cannon, featured a scattering of businesses: a struggling antique shop, a diner that smelled permanently of burnt coffee and regret, and, most prominently, the Havenwood County Courthouse. Built in 1888, the courthouse was a hulking, gothic-revival monstrosity of grey granite, its stained-glass windows depicting stern-faced figures dispensing justice that, in recent years, had mostly involved petty theft and the occasional zoning dispute. The air hung thick with the scent of damp leaves and woodsmoke, a quintessential New England autumn perfume.

**Opening:**

Theodora Beatrice Ainsworth hated the taste of pumpkin spice lattes, but she held the cardboard cup anyway, its warmth barely penetrating the chill that had settled deep into her bones. The courthouse clock tower chimed eight, its mournful clang echoing across the deserted town square. Theodora sighed, the sound misting in the frigid air.  She adjusted her heavy, tweed coat, pulling it tighter around her. For twenty years, she’d been a judge, first in Boston and then, for the last seven, here in Havenwood – a self-imposed exile after a scandal that still made her palms sweat.  She'd thought the quiet life, the predictability of small-town justice, would heal her. It hadn't. And today, that quiet was about to be shattered.  The reason sat across from her on the courthouse steps, a woman wrapped in a threadbare shawl, her eyes the color of granite and filled with a sorrow so profound it seemed to radiate from her like heat.  Theodora knew, with a certainty that chilled her more than the October air, that this woman, this stranger, was about to irrevocably change everything. The woman finally spoke, her voice a raspy whisper, "Judge Ainsworth? My name is Martha Crane.  And I need you to reopen a murder case... one from fifty years ago."
