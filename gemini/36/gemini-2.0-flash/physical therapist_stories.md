## Story Opening:

The stale smell of antiseptic and liniment hung heavy in the air, a scent that had become as familiar to Amelia Rose Davies as the gentle ache in her own aging knees. Outside, a November drizzle plastered the faded leaves to the sidewalk, mirroring the drabness of the waiting room. Amelia glanced up from her crossword puzzle as the door creaked open, announcing her next appointment. A young man, barely out of his teens, hobbled in, his face a grimace of discomfort. He was clutching a knee brace like a lifeline.

"Liam Miller?" Amelia asked, her voice warm and reassuring, a stark contrast to the chill of the day. "Come on in, take a seat. Let's see what we can do about that knee."

## Setting:

**Amelia Rose Davies' Physical Therapy Clinic, "Motion Matters,"** is located in a converted Victorian house in the somewhat rundown, but slowly revitalizing, neighborhood of Oakhaven in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

**Exterior:** The house itself is painted a faded, but cheerful, robin's egg blue. The porch railing is chipped in places, but adorned with overflowing pots of hardy mums, adding a splash of color against the grey November backdrop. A small, slightly crooked sign hangs above the door, proclaiming "Motion Matters - Physical Therapy & Rehabilitation."

**Interior:** The clinic is a cozy, if slightly cramped, space. The waiting room is furnished with mismatched, but comfortable, armchairs and a worn, floral-patterned sofa. Stacks of outdated magazines and dog-eared brochures about various ailments are scattered on a small table. A large, framed anatomical chart hangs on the wall, a testament to Amelia's dedication. Beyond the waiting room are two treatment rooms, each containing a hydraulic treatment table, resistance bands, weights, and other physical therapy equipment. The walls are painted a calming, light green and adorned with inspirational quotes and framed photographs of Amelia's patients celebrating their progress. The overall atmosphere is one of warmth, competence, and a quiet, determined spirit. It's a place where people come to rebuild their bodies and, in a way, their lives.
