**Opening:**

The fluorescent hum of the office lights was the soundtrack to Barry McMillan's life, a monotonous drone that rivaled the rhythmic click-clack of his calculator. He sat hunched over a stack of W-2s, each one a miniature paper testament to someone else's financial existence. Barry pinched the bridge of his nose, the scent of cheap coffee and stale donuts clinging to the air around him. It was April 14th, the eve of the tax deadline, and the pressure in McMillan Income Tax Services was thicker than a poorly prepared 1040 form. A bead of sweat trickled down his temple. He muttered, "Just one more day," the phrase sounding more like a weary prayer than a declaration.

**Setting:**

McMillan Income Tax Services occupied a cramped, ground-floor office in a nondescript strip mall on the outskirts of Harmony Creek, Ohio. The decor could generously be described as "functional." Off-white walls, punctuated by strategically placed (and slightly faded) posters advertising tax deductions and IRS deadlines, gave the room a clinical, almost sterile feel. Two rows of desks, cluttered with overflowing inboxes and outdated financial magazines, faced each other, creating a narrow aisle that clients nervously navigated. Barry's desk, situated near the back window overlooking a perpetually overflowing dumpster, was slightly larger and, if he was honest with himself, only marginally more organized than the others. A ceramic coffee mug proclaiming "World's Best Accountant (Probably)" sat precariously close to the edge, a constant threat to the mountain of paperwork that surrounded it. The air conditioning unit, a relic from the 1980s, wheezed intermittently, adding another layer to the office's cacophony of sounds. Despite the less-than-glamorous setting, Barry considered it his domain, a place where numbers reigned supreme and he, Barry McMillan, was their humble servant.
