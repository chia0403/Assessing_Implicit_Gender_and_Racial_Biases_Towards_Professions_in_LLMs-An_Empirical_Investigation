## Story Opening:

The stale, recycled air of the waiting room did little to quell the fluttering anxiety in Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth's chest. She smoothed down the crisp, linen blazer she wore over a calming cerulean dress, the color chosen specifically for its perceived ability to soothe troubled souls. Souls much like the young man currently drumming his fingers against the worn armrest of a mustard-yellow chair, his gaze fixed on the abstract art hanging crookedly on the wall. He hadn't looked up once since she'd peeked her head out of her office door five minutes ago, a silent plea radiating from his hunched posture.

Eleanor took a deep breath, mentally reviewing the notes she'd hastily scribbled from the referral. Twenty-two years old, diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, struggling with intrusive thoughts. Classic. But behind every clinical label, she reminded herself, was a real person, carrying a burden only they truly understood. 

She adjusted the nameplate on her door, its brass surface gleaming under the fluorescent lights. *Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth, Counseling Psychologist.* It felt heavy today, the title a reminder of the weight of responsibility she carried for the fragile minds she encountered. Today, she needed to be strong. Today, she needed to be the anchor he was so desperately searching for. She just hoped she was up to the task.

## Setting:

Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth's practice, "Ainsworth Counseling," occupied a corner suite on the seventh floor of the "Meridian Building" in downtown Portland, Oregon. The building itself was a concrete behemoth, a relic of the 1970s architecture boom, all harsh angles and tinted windows. Inside, however, Eleanor had attempted to create a sanctuary. The waiting room was bathed in soft, natural light that filtered through sheer curtains covering the panoramic city views. Comfortable, mismatched furniture – a plush velvet armchair here, a reclaimed wood coffee table there – populated the space, alongside thriving potted plants that added a splash of vibrant green.

Her office, connected to the waiting room by a narrow hallway lined with calming landscape prints, was similarly designed for comfort. A worn Persian rug covered the hardwood floor, softening the clinical edge of the space. A large, inviting couch sat opposite her desk, strategically positioned to allow for both direct eye contact and comfortable distance. Her bookshelf, overflowing with volumes on psychology, philosophy, and even a few well-loved novels, served as a testament to her passion for understanding the human experience. The overall impression was one of quiet competence and genuine empathy, a deliberate effort to create a space where her patients felt safe enough to unravel their deepest vulnerabilities.
