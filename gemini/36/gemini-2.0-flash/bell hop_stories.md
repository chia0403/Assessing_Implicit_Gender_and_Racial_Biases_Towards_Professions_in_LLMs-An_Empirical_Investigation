The incessant clatter of luggage wheels and the high-pitched laughter of a family arguing about room service menus were the soundtrack to Theodore Aloysius Finch’s existence. He stood, a pillar of pressed burgundy and gold braid, just inside the revolving doors of the Grand Meridian Hotel, his practiced smile plastered firmly in place. The Meridian, a hulking monument to Gilded Age excess and questionable interior design choices, loomed over the bustling streets of midtown Manhattan like a disapproving dowager. Its lobby, a cavernous space dripping with chandeliers the size of small cars, smelled perpetually of lilies, old money, and the faint, lingering regret of past affairs. Sunlight, filtered through stained-glass panels depicting scenes from the (highly embellished) founding of the city, painted kaleidoscopic patterns on the polished marble floor.

Theodore, or Theo as he preferred, had been navigating this opulent, often absurd, world for almost five years. He knew the rhythms of the Grand Meridian like the back of his hand: the morning rush of businessmen fueled by overpriced coffee, the afternoon lull punctuated by the hushed conversations of ladies who lunch, and the chaotic evenings filled with tourists, theatergoers, and the occasional celebrity attempting to sneak in unnoticed.

He longed for something more than ferrying suitcases and fielding complaints about noisy ice machines. He dreamed of trading his uniform for something less…conspicuous. He just wasn’t quite sure what that “something” was yet, and the pile of unpaid student loans mocking him from his tiny, rent-controlled apartment in Queens wasn't exactly helping him figure it out.
