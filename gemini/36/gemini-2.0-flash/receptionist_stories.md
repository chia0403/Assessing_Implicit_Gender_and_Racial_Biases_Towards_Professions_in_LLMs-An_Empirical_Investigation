## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights of the lobby hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Penelope Anastasia Davies' acrylic nails on the pristine, obsidian-black reception desk. Outside, the Seattle rain was living up to its reputation, a relentless curtain blurring the already hazy cityscape visible through the panoramic windows of OmniCorp Tower. Penelope, however, was dry, caffeinated, and deeply absorbed in a particularly juicy thread on the "Celebrity Fashion Fails" subreddit.

Her posture was perfect, even while surreptitiously scrolling through images of a certain pop star’s unfortunate choice of Crocs with socks. Years of training at Mrs. Hawthorne’s Academy for Charm and Etiquette had instilled in her an unwavering ability to project an air of poised professionalism, regardless of the chaos unfolding within her mind – or, in this case, on her phone. It was a skill that served her well, considering the constant stream of eccentric inventors, sleep-deprived programmers, and overly ambitious executives that passed through the OmniCorp lobby on a daily basis.

Today, however, felt different. The usual drone of the coffee machine was eerily absent. Ms. Periwinkle, the resident plant enthusiast, hadn’t yet arrived with her daily dose of horticultural gossip. Even Mr. Henderson, the CEO’s notoriously punctual executive assistant, was running late. The air was thick with a palpable tension, an undercurrent of unease that even Penelope, queen of compartmentalization, couldn’t quite ignore. And then, the silence shattered.
## Setting:

**OmniCorp Tower Lobby:**

*   **Location:** Seattle, Washington, in the heart of the tech district.
*   **Building:** A sleek, modern skyscraper made of steel and glass, boasting panoramic views of the city, Puget Sound, and the Olympic Mountains (when the rain wasn't obscuring them).
*   **Lobby Decor:** Minimally decorated in shades of grey and black with accents of brushed silver. Modern art pieces, mostly abstract and vaguely unsettling, adorned the walls. A large water feature gurgled quietly in one corner, supposedly meant to be calming but mostly just added to the ambient humidity. Expensive but uncomfortable furniture was strategically placed for waiting visitors.
*   **Reception Desk:** A large, imposing structure made of obsidian-black granite. Impeccably clean and organized, it was the command center of the lobby, equipped with multiple monitors, a sophisticated phone system, and a hidden drawer full of emergency chocolate.
*   **Atmosphere:** Normally buzzing with activity and the hushed murmur of conversations, today the atmosphere is unusually quiet and tense, adding to the suspense of the opening scene. The smell of freshly brewed coffee, usually a constant presence, is conspicuously absent.
