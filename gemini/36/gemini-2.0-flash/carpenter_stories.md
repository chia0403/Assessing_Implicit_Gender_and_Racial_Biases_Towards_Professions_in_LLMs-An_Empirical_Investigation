## Story Opening:

The scent of sawdust and linseed oil hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket that usually soothed Jasper Alexander Thorne. Today, however, it did little to ease the tension that coiled in his stomach like a stubborn knot. He ran a calloused hand over the smooth, unfinished surface of the coffin, a masterpiece of cherrywood he'd poured his heart and soul into for the past three days. It was beautiful, almost too beautiful for the grim purpose it was intended for.

He lifted the lid, the hinges sighing a melancholic tune, and stared inside. The velvet lining, a deep, almost funereal purple, seemed to swallow the light. He pictured Mrs. Henderson, a wisp of a woman with kind eyes and a smile that could thaw the frost on a January morning, lying still and cold within it. The thought made his breath catch in his throat. He hated building coffins.

This was the third one this month, and the quiet town of Havenwood was starting to feel less like a haven, and more like a waiting room for the afterlife. Jasper tightened his grip on the plane in his hand, the smooth wood grounding him in the present, in the tangible reality of the workshop. He had to finish. He had to deliver it. He had to be the strong, silent carpenter Havenwood expected him to be, even when his own heart ached with the same grief that clung to the town like morning mist.

## Setting:

The story opens in Jasper Alexander Thorne’s small, cluttered workshop in Havenwood, nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. The workshop is a converted barn, its weathered wooden walls lined with tools – saws, planes, chisels, hammers – each meticulously cleaned and sharpened. The air is thick with the aroma of wood and oil, and sunlight streams through the dusty, arched windows, illuminating motes of sawdust dancing in the air. Racks hold planks of various types of wood: oak, cherry, maple, each carefully selected for its unique grain and strength. The floor is covered in a thick layer of wood shavings, testament to Jasper's tireless work. Outside, the quiet hum of Havenwood drifts in: the distant chime of the church bell, the murmur of voices from the general store, the rustle of leaves in the ancient oak trees that line the town square. It’s a peaceful, picturesque setting, but a creeping sense of unease is beginning to permeate the air, a feeling that something is amiss beneath the tranquil surface of Havenwood.
