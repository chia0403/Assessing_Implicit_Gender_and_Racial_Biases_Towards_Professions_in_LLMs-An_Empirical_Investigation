The insistent chirping of Maya Sharma's alarm clock, set for the ungodly hour of 4:45 AM, felt like a personal affront. Groaning, Maya slapped the snooze button, a futile gesture she knew she'd repeat at least twice more. She could already taste the lukewarm coffee and feel the familiar ache in her muscles from yesterday's power yoga class. But Maya Sharma, certified fitness instructor extraordinaire and owner of "Synergy Studio," knew better than to give in. Sunrise demanded her presence.

The studio, perched on the second floor of a converted warehouse overlooking the Providence River, was Maya's sanctuary. Sunlight streamed through the enormous, grimy windows, painting the exposed brick walls in hues of gold and rose. The air still held the faint scent of lavender essential oil from the previous evening's restorative yoga session, a calming fragrance that usually eased Maya's pre-dawn anxiety. Today, though, it did little to soothe the nagging worry about dwindling class sizes and the ever-increasing rent. Providence, Rhode Island, was a beautiful city, but it was also a cutthroat one for small business owners, especially in the fiercely competitive world of fitness.
