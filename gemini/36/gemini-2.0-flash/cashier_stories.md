The hum of the fluorescent lights in the Quick Stop Market was a constant, monotonous drone that gnawed at Eleanor "Ellie" Ramirez's sanity. It was 7:17 PM, the tail end of the after-work rush, and the line of customers had finally dwindled to a manageable trickle. Ellie leaned against her register, the cool metal a welcome respite against her tired back, and watched a dust bunny tumble across the linoleum floor.

The Quick Stop Market was nestled in the heart of Oakhaven, a sleepy suburb of Denver, Colorado. It wasn't particularly charming. The building, a faded brick rectangle, sat sandwiched between a laundromat and a discount tire store. The parking lot was perpetually cracked and filled with stray shopping carts, and the interior smelled perpetually of stale coffee and day-old doughnuts. But for Ellie, it was a refuge, a predictable, if uninspiring, routine.

She adjusted the name tag pinned to her blue Quick Stop uniform – "Ellie" embroidered in a cheerful yellow font – and sighed. Outside, the Colorado sky was bleeding into shades of orange and purple, promising a brisk evening. Inside, the Quick Stop remained resolutely and artificially bright, a beacon of processed snacks and lottery tickets against the gathering dusk. Ellie just had to survive another three hours.
