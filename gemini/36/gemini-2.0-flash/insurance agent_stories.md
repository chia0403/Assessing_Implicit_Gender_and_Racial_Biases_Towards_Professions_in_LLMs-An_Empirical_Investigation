The incessant buzzing of the fluorescent lights hummed a melancholic tune, a soundtrack to Mildred Abernathy's Monday morning misery. Her cubicle, a beige box in a sea of beige boxes at "Secure & Serene Insurance: Your Peace of Mind, Our Priority" (or as Mildred privately called it, "Secure & Serene: Mostly Papercuts and Mild Existential Dread"), felt particularly oppressive. Outside, a November rain hammered against the building's cheap, single-paned windows, painting the city of Pittsburgh in a drab, grey wash.

Mildred, a woman whose life ambition had once extended beyond accurately calculating life insurance premiums, sighed and adjusted the knitted, cat-themed scarf around her neck. It was a gift from her eccentric Aunt Beatrice, who insisted it brought good luck. Mildred suspected the only thing it brought was unwanted attention from Brenda in accounting, who always felt the need to comment on her "kitty obsession." Today, though, even Brenda's commentary seemed less irritating than the mountain of claim forms threatening to topple from her overflowing inbox.

The phone, a shrill, unwelcome intruder in the morning's misery-symphony, blared to life. Mildred braced herself, her hand hovering over the receiver like a hesitant warrior facing a formidable foe. "Secure & Serene, this is Mildred Abernathy, how can I brighten your day?" she asked, her voice laced with a forced cheerfulness that felt as artificial as the plastic poinsettia on her desk.
