Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a hairdresser named:

**Story Opening:**

The scent of ammonia and overripe mangoes hung thick in the air, a signature aroma that clung to Beatrice Amelia Featherstone like a second skin. She inhaled deeply, the familiar tang a comforting presence against the anxieties that prickled beneath her ribcage. Beatrice stared at her reflection in the salon mirror, her own dark, tightly-curled hair a stark contrast to the blonde bombshell she was about to create. "Just breathe, Bea," she muttered, adjusting the silver headband that held back stray strands. "It's just hair. And this," she patted the shimmering tub of platinum blonde dye, "is just money in the bank."

**Setting:**

The salon, christened "The Gilded Curl," was tucked away on a side street just off the bustling main square of Port Blossom, a seaside town clinging to the coast of Cornwall. Outside, whitewashed houses with slate roofs nestled together, facing the turbulent Atlantic. Inside, The Gilded Curl was a riot of mismatched vintage furniture, antique mirrors, and brightly coloured wallpaper, a quirky contrast to the often-weathered faces of its clientele. Shelves overflowed with brightly coloured bottles of shampoo, conditioners, and styling products, each promising a miracle. Beatrice had inherited the salon from her grandmother, a woman as eccentric and vibrant as the salon itself. While the locals loved the salon, the shop was not well-kept - Beatrice was trying to sell it to a rich woman who kept increasing the list of demands before finalizing the purchase.
