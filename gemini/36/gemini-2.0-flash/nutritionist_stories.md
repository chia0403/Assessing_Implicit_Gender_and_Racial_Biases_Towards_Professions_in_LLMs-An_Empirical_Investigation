**Opening:**

The aroma of cardamom and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a traitorous scent that clawed its way past Dr. Genevieve Mallory’s carefully curated resolve. She tried to focus on the spreadsheet blinking back at her from the laptop screen – a meticulous breakdown of micronutrient deficiencies in her latest patient – but the siren song of the corner bakery proved too potent. It was a Thursday morning, the day Madame Odette, the bakery's owner, baked her famous pain aux raisins. Genevieve sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose. Willpower was a muscle, she reminded herself, and hers felt decidedly flabby this week.

**Setting:**

Dr. Genevieve Mallory's nutrition practice, "The Well Nourished Life," occupied a sunny corner unit on the second floor of a renovated brick building in the heart of Willow Creek, Oregon. Willow Creek, nestled amongst rolling hills and vineyards, was a town obsessed with wellness, farm-to-table dining, and outdoor activities. Genevieve's office reflected this ethos. Pale green walls were adorned with framed botanical prints. Sunlight streamed through large windows, illuminating shelves overflowing with cookbooks, scientific journals, and colorful jars filled with everything from spirulina powder to dried goji berries. A comfortable armchair sat beside a small table piled with pamphlets on mindful eating and gut health. The overall impression was one of calm and quiet, a sanctuary designed to encourage healthy habits. However, the idyllic scene was routinely disrupted by the tantalizing aroma of nearby bakeries, a constant temptation in a town that embraced indulgence as much as it did wellness.
