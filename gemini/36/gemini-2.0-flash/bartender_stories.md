The flickering neon sign outside "The Rusty Mug" cast a lurid, pinkish glow across the slick, rain-washed street. Inside, the air hung thick with the combined scents of stale beer, cheap cigarettes, and simmering despair â€“ a familiar perfume that Amelia "Amy" Corvus had grown accustomed to over the past five years. It was a Tuesday night in Oakhaven, a town clinging precariously to the edge of the Redwood National Forest, a place where the glory days of logging were a fading memory and the best entertainment was either a drunken bar brawl or a particularly dramatic sunset.

Amy, or more formally, Amelia Corvus, leaned against the polished mahogany bar, her elbows propped up on its surface, watching the slow dance of raindrops tracing paths down the frosted window. Her dark hair, usually pulled back in a severe bun, had loosened slightly, wisps escaping to frame her face. She rubbed a clean glass with a practiced motion, the familiar ritual a small comfort against the encroaching boredom. The bar was only half-full: Old Man Hemlock nursed his usual shot of rye at the corner booth, muttering grievances about the government; a couple of tourists, probably lost and looking for Wi-Fi, huddled nervously by the jukebox; and a lone trucker, face obscured by the shadow of his baseball cap, silently ate a plate of suspiciously grey chili.

It was just another night at The Rusty Mug, just another slow drip in the relentless monotony of Oakhaven, and Amelia was bracing herself for the long, quiet hours ahead. Until the door creaked open, and a woman walked in, the cold night clinging to her like a shroud.
