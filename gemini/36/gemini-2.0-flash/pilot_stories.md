**Opening:**

The high-pitched whine of the turboprops was almost meditative, a constant hum that vibrated through Lieutenant Commander Amelia Iris Thorne, settling somewhere deep in her bones. It was a sound she’d known since she was a child, clinging to her father’s hand on dusty airfields, watching him coax weary biplanes back to life. Now, the sound was the soundtrack to her own life, the constant reminder of freedom and the sky. Today, however, it was also a shroud of anxiety.

**Setting:**

Amelia Iris Thorne was piloting a heavily modified Lockheed P-8 Poseidon, callsign "Kraken 6," on a routine patrol over the choppy, slate-grey waters of the Norwegian Sea. The interior of the aircraft was a controlled chaos of glowing screens, blinking lights, and hushed communication. Two sonar operators hunched over their consoles, their faces illuminated by the cool blue light, while the navigator charted their course on a holographic display. Outside, a perpetual twilight reigned, a low, sullen sun casting long shadows across the icy waves. The air was thick with the metallic tang of machinery and the faint, almost imperceptible scent of ozone, a constant reminder of the raw power contained within the belly of the Kraken. The temperature was dropping rapidly, a grim promise of the impending Arctic winter, and a chill that even the thickest flight suit couldn't quite ward off.
