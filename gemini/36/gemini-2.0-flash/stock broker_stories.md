## Opening & Setting:

The fluorescent lights of the Manhattan Trading Corporation hummed a monotonous song, a soundtrack to the relentless ballet of buys and sells, rises and falls. Elias Thorne, his face pale under the artificial sun, adjusted the headset perched precariously on his head. His tie, a power blue silk, felt like a noose slowly tightening with each dip in the Dow Jones. This wasn't the champagne-soaked, wolf-of-Wall-Street fantasy they showed on TV. This was gut-wrenching, nail-biting reality, and today, reality was biting hard.

Elias had been staring at the same blinking green number for the last hour, a number that represented his client, Mr. Abernathy's, entire retirement fund â€“ and by extension, Elias's professional reputation. It was a slow, agonizing leak. Each tick downwards was a tiny hammer blow to his chest. 

His cubicle, a cramped rectangle of muted grey, was littered with crumpled sticky notes, half-empty coffee cups, and the ghosts of past triumphs (and far more numerous failures). A faded photograph of his daughter, Lily, grinned back at him from the corner of his monitor. Her innocent smile was a painful reminder of what was at stake. He needed to pull this back. He *had* to. Lily's future, Mr. Abernathy's golden years, his own sanity - they all hung precariously in the balance.
