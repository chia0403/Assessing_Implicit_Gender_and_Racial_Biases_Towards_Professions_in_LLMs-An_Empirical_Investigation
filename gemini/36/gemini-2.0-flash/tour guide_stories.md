Okay, here's a story opening and setting, featuring a tour guide:

**Story Opening:**

The salt spray stung Eleanor Josephine "Ellie Jo" Mallory's face as she hauled the "Greetings, Ghouls!" banner a little higher, securing it to the wrought iron fence.  The wind, an unruly beast born somewhere out over the Atlantic, threatened to rip it free and send it cartwheeling down the cobblestone street. Ellie Jo muttered a curse, a practice her grandmother, God rest her soul, would have frowned upon, but tonight, in the face of impending doom... well, a little profanity seemed justified. It wasn't just the weather.  It was the date.  October 31st.  And on Halloween night in Savannah, Georgia, everyone wanted a piece of Ellie Jo Mallory's Haunted History Tour.

**Setting:**

The setting is Savannah, Georgia, specifically the historic district, around dusk on Halloween night. The scene takes place on a narrow, cobblestone street lined with historic mansions and moss-draped oak trees. The houses boast intricate ironwork balconies and dimly lit gas lamps, casting an eerie glow on the scene. The air is thick with the smell of salt and decaying leaves, mingled with the sugary scent of cotton candy being sold by street vendors. A palpable sense of anticipation and excitement hangs in the air, heightened by the approaching darkness and the knowledge of the city's long and storied (and allegedly haunted) past.
