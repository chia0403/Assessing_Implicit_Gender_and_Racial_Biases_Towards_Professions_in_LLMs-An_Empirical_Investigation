## Story Opening:

The rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the ceiling fan was the only sound besides the chirping cicadas that broke the stifling heat of the Louisiana night. Dr. Amelia Rose Dubois, M.D., wiped a bead of sweat from her brow with the back of her hand, leaving a faint streak of saline across her already smudged cheek. She leaned back in her creaky wooden chair, the springs groaning in protest, and stared at the half-finished chart in front of her. The flickering gas lamp cast long, dancing shadows across the room, making the already unsettling sketches of internal organs seem to pulse with a life of their own. It had been a long day, filled with the usual mix of ailments: swamp fever, consumption, and the occasional unfortunate encounter with a gator that mistook a limb for a particularly delicious snack.

**Setting:**

The year is 1898. Amelia's practice is located in the small, isolated bayou town of Bellefleur, Louisiana. The town itself is a collection of ramshackle houses perched on stilts above the murky waters, connected by narrow, winding boardwalks. Spanish moss hangs thick and heavy from the ancient cypress trees, giving the place an atmosphere of both beauty and decay. The air is thick with the scent of jasmine, decaying vegetation, and the ever-present humidity. Amelia's office is a small, single-room structure attached to the back of her own home, a modest, though well-maintained, shotgun shack. Inside, the walls are lined with bookshelves overflowing with medical texts, botanical guides, and the odd volume of poetry. A worn examination table sits in the center of the room, stained with the indelible marks of countless examinations. Herbs hang drying from the rafters, filling the air with a pungent aroma that both comforts and repels. The overall impression is one of dedicated, if somewhat desperate, effort against the relentless forces of nature and the limitations of medical knowledge in this remote corner of the world.
