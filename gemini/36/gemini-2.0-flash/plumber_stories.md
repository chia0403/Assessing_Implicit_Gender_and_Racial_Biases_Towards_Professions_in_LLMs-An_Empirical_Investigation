## Story Opening:

The smell of sulfur and despair hung thick in the air, clinging to the damp, moss-covered brick walls of the abandoned asylum like a malevolent spirit. For a normal plumber, the job would have been a hard pass, a quick mumbled "sorry, can't do it," followed by a hasty retreat. But not for Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins. He thrived on the unconventional, the frankly disgusting, the utterly bizarre. And besides, the pay was astronomical.

Bart wiped a bead of sweat from his brow, his calloused fingers tightening around the handle of his trusty adjustable wrench. He squinted, peering through the gloom cast by his work lamp. The single source of light illuminated a tangled mess of corroded pipes snaking across the basement ceiling, each one dripping with a murky, unidentifiable fluid. The floor beneath his boots was a tapestry of cracked concrete, stained with who-knew-what.

He sighed, the sound echoing ominously in the cavernous space. "Right then," he muttered to himself, his voice barely audible above the incessant drip, drip, drip. "Let's see what horrors you're hiding, you rusty old bastard."

## Setting:

**Location:** The abandoned Crestwood Hills Asylum, located on a remote, heavily forested hillside overlooking the small, perpetually overcast town of Hollow Creek, Maine.

**Time:** Late Autumn, approaching the end of October, just a few days before Halloween. The air is crisp and carries the scent of decaying leaves and damp earth.

**Atmosphere:** Oppressive, claustrophobic, and permeated with a sense of decay and lingering suffering. The asylum is in a state of extreme disrepair, with crumbling walls, shattered windows, and overgrown foliage creeping in from the outside. The interior is dark, damp, and filled with strange noises - the creak of unseen doors, the whisper of wind through broken panes, and the unsettling echo ofâ€¦ something else. A feeling of unease settles upon anyone who enters, a sense of being watched and unwelcome.
