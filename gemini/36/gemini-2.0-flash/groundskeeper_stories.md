The crisp autumn air, thick with the scent of decaying leaves and damp earth, nipped at Elias Thistlewick's nose as he unlocked the wrought-iron gates of Willow Creek Cemetery. The ancient lock, swollen with rust and disuse, complained with a grating screech that echoed unnervingly across the rows of weathered headstones. It was just past dawn, the sun a pale gold sliver peeking over the gnarled branches of the ancient willow trees that gave the cemetery its melancholic name.

Elias, all five-foot-ten of him, with his stooped shoulders and perpetually dirt-stained fingernails, wrestled the gates open wide enough for his battered old pick-up truck. He shivered, not just from the cold, but from the feeling he always got in Willow Creek – a sense of quiet observation, a weight of untold stories pressing down on him. He’d been the groundskeeper here for twenty years, ever since his grandfather, Silas, had passed away and left him the job, along with the creaky Victorian cottage on the edge of the property and the responsibility for keeping the memories of the departed undisturbed.
