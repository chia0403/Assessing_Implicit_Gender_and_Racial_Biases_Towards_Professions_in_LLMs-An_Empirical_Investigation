The biting wind whipped off the Firth of Forth, stinging Amelia Eleanor Ramsey’s cheeks as she battled her way across the Dean Bridge. Edinburgh, usually a symphony of honeyed sandstone and gothic grandeur, was today a watercolor gone wrong, all greys and blurring edges. Amelia, bundled in a thick, charcoal-colored wool coat that swallowed her petite frame, pulled the collar higher and hunched her shoulders, trying to ward off the chill that seemed to seep into her very bones.

She hadn't planned on being out in such weather, but the insistent phone call from Mrs. MacIntyre had been impossible to ignore. “Amelia, dear, you simply *must* see it before the council approves that… that monstrosity!” The ‘it’ in question was the proposed redevelopment of the old Leith Docks, a project Mrs. MacIntyre claimed would “destroy the soul of the city.”

Amelia, a fiercely passionate architect with a love for preserving historical integrity, knew she had to see for herself. Mrs. MacIntyre, her most esteemed and eccentric client, had tasked her with designing a discreet but effective campaign to block the development, and understanding the site was paramount.

The Leith Docks, a labyrinth of cobbled streets, crumbling warehouses, and rusted cranes, held a certain melancholy charm. The scent of salt and brine mingled with the faint, lingering aroma of shipbuilding and trade, a palpable whisper of the past. For Amelia, it was a living, breathing tapestry of history, a testament to Edinburgh’s maritime heritage. And, judging from the ominous diagrams Mrs. MacIntyre had provided, the developers planned to tear it all down and replace it with… well, she shuddered at the thought. Modernity, in its most soulless and brutal form.
