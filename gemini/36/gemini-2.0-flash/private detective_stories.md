The biting November wind clawed at the corners of Arthur Penhaligon’s worn trench coat as he stood outside the decaying grandeur of the Blackwood Manor gates. Iron roses, once meticulously crafted, now bloomed with rust and neglect, their thorny stems bent at grotesque angles. A tattered “Beware of Dog” sign swung precariously from one, a cruel joke considering the only sounds emanating from the overgrown grounds were the mournful creak of ancient trees and the distant caw of a crow.

The setting was Oakhaven, a town clinging to the edge of the Cornish coast, a place where secrets clung tighter than the salty mist that rolled in from the sea. Oakhaven was known for its picturesque harbor and charming cobbled streets, a haven for tourists in the summer months. But now, in the skeletal grip of winter, its true nature emerged: a place of gnarled histories and hushed whispers, a breeding ground for the kind of darkness that Arthur Penhaligon, with his weary eyes and world-worn soul, knew all too well. He was here because darkness, like the tide, always finds its way in.
