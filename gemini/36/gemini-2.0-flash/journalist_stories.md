The stale coffee clinging to the lining of Amelia Stone's stomach did little to quell the gnawing anxiety. Amelia, a seasoned investigative journalist for the "Denver Dispatch," found herself perched on the edge of a cracked vinyl booth in the "Greasy Spoon," a diner that reeked of desperation and week-old bacon grease. It was 4:57 AM, and the neon sign outside sputtered intermittently, casting a flickering, sickly yellow light across the grimy interior.

The diner, nestled in the forgotten industrial district of Aurora, Colorado, was a haven for long-haul truckers, graveyard shift workers, and those whose lives had veered so far off course they'd ended up parked permanently on the shoulder. Amelia, though, was here on purpose. This was where 'Whisper' Williams, her key source in a sprawling corruption case involving city council members and shady land developers, liked to meet. He was always late, always paranoid, and always worth the trouble. The clatter of dishes and the low hum of the greasy spoon were a comforting backdrop to the dangerous information he invariably spilled.
