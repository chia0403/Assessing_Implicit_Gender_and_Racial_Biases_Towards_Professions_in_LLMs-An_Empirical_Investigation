## Story Opening:

The salt spray kissed Eleanor Marguerite Ainsworth's face as she stood on the weathered deck, the biting wind whipping strands of her meticulously coiffed blonde hair across her cheek. Before her, the churning Atlantic Ocean stretched to a hazy horizon, a canvas of turbulent grey. Below, the jagged rocks of the Nova Scotia coastline swallowed and regurgitated the waves with a hungry roar. Eleanor adjusted her crimson scarf, its silk doing little against the relentless chill, and took a deep breath, trying to conjure a smile.

"This," she announced, her voice barely audible above the wind, "is what we call 'rustic charm'."

The prospective buyers, a young couple named Liam and Chloe, huddled together, looking less charmed and more terrified. Liam, in particular, looked like he wanted to be anywhere but here, preferably somewhere warm and dry. Chloe, bless her heart, was trying. She pulled her own scarf tighter and managed a weak smile.

"It's...definitely... rustic," she conceded.

Eleanor, a top-performing real estate agent with Coldwell Banker in Halifax, prided herself on her ability to sell anything. But even she was beginning to feel the weight of this particular challenge. "Rustic" was one way to describe the dilapidated, wind-battered cottage perched precariously on the edge of the cliff. "Suicidal" was another, and frankly, closer to the truth.

## Setting:

**Location:** A remote, windswept point of land on the Nova Scotia coastline, approximately an hour's drive outside of Halifax. The nearest town, Port Maitland, is a small fishing village with a general store, a lobster pound, and a church.

**Time:** Mid-November, late afternoon. The sun is beginning to dip towards the horizon, casting long, dramatic shadows.

**Environment:** The weather is harsh and unpredictable, typical of the Atlantic coast. A strong wind blows constantly, carrying with it the scent of salt and seaweed. The coastline is rugged and dramatic, with jagged cliffs, rocky beaches, and dense evergreen forests. The property itself is a dilapidated cottage, seemingly clinging to the edge of the cliff with all its might. The paint is peeling, the windows are cracked, and the overall impression is one of neglect and decay.
