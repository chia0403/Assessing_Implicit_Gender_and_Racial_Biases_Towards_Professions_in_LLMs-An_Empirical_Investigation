Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a drafting worker as the main character:

**Setting:**

The year is 1952. The place is the bustling, slightly claustrophobic drafting room of "Metropolitan Steel & Bridge," located on the 14th floor of a soot-stained building in downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Fluorescent lights hum incessantly overhead, reflecting harshly off the vast sea of drafting tables. The air is thick with the scent of graphite, ammonia from the blueprint machine in the corner, and the ever-present aroma of stale coffee emanating from the communal pot perpetually brewing on a nearby shelf. The walls are plastered with tattered blueprints, faded photographs of completed bridges, and safety posters featuring cartoon characters who have clearly met unfortunate fates due to carelessness. Outside, the clang and screech of trolleys and the distant roar of the steel mills provide a constant, low-frequency hum.

**Story Opening:**

Mildred "Millie" Eleanor Cartwright carefully adjusted the angle of her T-square against the edge of her drafting table, the wood worn smooth and almost polished from years of use. The rhythmic scraping sound, a familiar lullaby in the otherwise chaotic room, momentarily drowned out the bickering between Mr. Henderson and young Benny, who was forever losing his pencils. Millie took a deep breath, trying to ignore the tremor in her hand. Today's task was particularly daunting: translating the Chief Engineer's cryptic, hand-scribbled notes into a full-scale blueprint for the new suspension bridge span destined to connect the South Side to the rest of the city. Bridges were her life, her passion even, but this one…this one felt different. This one felt like it held more weight than just steel and concrete. It felt like it held her future. She glanced up at the clock. 8:17 AM. Another day, another blueprint, another step closer to proving that a woman could be just as good – maybe even better – at this job than any of the men who constantly underestimated her.
