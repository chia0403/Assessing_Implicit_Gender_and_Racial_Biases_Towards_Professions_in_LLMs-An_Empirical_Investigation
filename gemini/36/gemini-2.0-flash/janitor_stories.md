The fluorescent lights of the Starlight Film Studios buzzed a monotonous hum, a soundtrack to Bartholomew "Bart" Finch's already monotonous existence. He pushed his heavy-duty cleaning cart, the squeal of its wheels echoing in the cavernous, empty soundstage. Stage 7, where only hours ago, the flamboyant Director Moreau had been barking orders and meticulously arranging extras for the climax of his historical epic, "The Crimson Corsair," was now Bart's domain.

Dust motes, illuminated by the harsh overhead glare, danced in the air like tiny, rebellious pirates themselves. Bart sighed, his breath clouding briefly in the cool, stale air. The scent of sawdust, stale coffee, and the faint perfume of a long-gone starlet clung to the thick velvet curtains that formed the backdrop, a chaotic seascape painted with hues of deep blues and menacing grays.

It was just after 3 AM. The only sound besides the incessant buzzing was the rhythmic whoosh of the industrial ventilation system. Outside, the sprawling studio lot was a graveyard of silent cameras, deserted trailers, and looming, artificial landscapes. Hollywood, even in its artificial iteration, was a city that slept fitfully. Bart, however, was wide awake, meticulously emptying overflowing trash cans filled with crumpled scripts, discarded coffee cups, and the remnants of a glamorous, ephemeral world he would never truly be a part of. He was just Bart Finch, the janitor. The invisible man who cleaned up the mess after the stars had faded.
