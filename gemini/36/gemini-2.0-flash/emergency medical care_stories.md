Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring an Emergency Medical Care provider:

**Opening & Setting:**

The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, stinging the exposed skin of Eleanor "Ellie" Ramirez as she wrestled the unresponsive homeless man onto the gurney. The flashing strobes of the ambulance painted the scene in stark, pulsating blues and reds against the pre-dawn gloom. It was 4:17 AM, and the biting Chicago January air was a brutal reminder that her shift at EMS Station 12 was far from over.  The alley reeked of stale beer, urine, and something vaguely metallic that made Ellie's stomach churn.  Normally, she'd be at home, curled up with a book and a mug of chamomile tea before facing another day as a single parent. Instead, she was here, in this grimy corner of the world, trying to coax life back into a body already ravaged by neglect and hardship. A thin layer of ice glazed the bricks of the building, and the only sound besides the ambulance's idling engine was the rhythmic hiss of Ellie's portable oxygen tank as she prepped the man for transport. She glanced at her partner, young, fresh-faced David Miller, whose eagerness hadn't yet been worn down by the city's endless cycle of suffering. He looked back with a worried frown.

"Vitals are dropping, Ellie," he said, his voice tight with concern. "Pulse is thready, and his respirations are shallow.  Let's get him to County, stat."

Ellie nodded, her jaw tight. "Let's go."
