## Opening:

The persistent, melodious chime of the concierge desk phone sliced through the quiet murmur of the Hotel Grand Elysium lobby like a perfectly aimed scalpel. Eleanor Anastasia Dubois sighed, setting down the meticulously folded linen napkin she'd been obsessing over – a slight crease, just there, wouldn’t do – and reached for the receiver.

"Concierge Desk, Eleanor Dubois speaking. How may I assist you?" she said, her voice a flawless blend of professional warmth and practiced neutrality. Before she could even process the garbled response on the other end, a frantic hand tugged at the polished mahogany counter. A woman with hair like spun gold, a cascade of diamonds at her throat, and a desperate plea etched onto her face was practically vibrating with anxiety.

“Eleanor, darling, thank goodness you’re here! It’s utterly catastrophic! The emerald, the legendary Elysium Emerald, it’s… gone!”

Eleanor’s perfectly sculpted eyebrows lifted a fraction. Catastrophes were her specialty. But legendary, disappeared emeralds? That was a new one. This morning was already looking far more interesting than she'd anticipated.

## Setting:

The **Hotel Grand Elysium** is a landmark building in the heart of **Geneva, Switzerland**. Occupying a prime spot overlooking Lake Geneva, the hotel exudes an old-world opulence that whispers of discreet wealth and generations of impeccable service.

The lobby is a symphony of polished marble, glittering chandeliers, and antique furniture upholstered in rich velvet. Sunlight streams through enormous arched windows, reflecting off the glistening gold accents that adorn every corner. Vases overflowing with orchids and lilies scent the air with a subtle floral fragrance.

The Concierge Desk, where Eleanor holds court, is a meticulously organized haven of information and discretion. Behind the desk stretches a wall adorned with elegant wooden pigeonholes, each labelled with the names of long-term guests and important contacts. A large, antique map of Geneva dominates one wall, peppered with tiny flags marking points of interest and recommended establishments. Everything, from the precisely sharpened pencils to the immaculately arranged brochures, is designed to inspire confidence and reassure guests that their every need, no matter how obscure, will be met.
