The incessant chirping of the robin, perched on the oak tree outside her office window, did little to soothe the rising tide of anxiety threatening to engulf Dr. Eleanor Beatrice Ainsworth. Sunlight streamed into the room, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air, but failing to brighten the knot of dread that had taken root in her stomach. This was it. The first day back after summer vacation, and the first year since the disastrous student-teacher scandal that had rocked Northwood High to its foundations.

Eleanor’s office, normally a sanctuary of calm pastels and carefully curated motivational posters, felt sterile and suffocating. She’d always prided herself on creating a safe, welcoming space for her students, a haven where they could unload their burdens without fear of judgment. Now, that feeling of safety felt fragile, a carefully constructed illusion threatened by the lingering shadow of what had transpired last spring.

Northwood High itself was a sprawling brick building, a monument to mid-century modern architecture that had aged gracelessly. Located in the affluent, yet increasingly polarized, suburban town of Oak Haven, Connecticut, the school was a pressure cooker of academic ambition, parental expectations, and teenage angst. Eleanor knew it intimately. She’d walked these halls as a student, graduated at the top of her class, and returned years later with a passion to guide the next generation. But now, she couldn't shake the feeling that she was walking into a battlefield, armed only with empathy and a worn-out copy of "What Color Is Your Parachute?".
