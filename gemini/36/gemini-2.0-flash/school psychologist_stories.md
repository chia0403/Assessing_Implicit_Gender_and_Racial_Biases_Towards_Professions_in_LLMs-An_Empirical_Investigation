Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a story featuring a school psychologist:

**Setting:**

The small, cramped office of Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Ainsworth, school psychologist for Northwood Elementary. Sunlight, filtered through a dusty mini-blind, cast stripes across the room. The office, a former supply closet, was overflowing. Stacks of paperwork threatened to topple from the desk, precariously balanced alongside half-empty mugs of lukewarm tea and a collection of hand-drawn pictures taped to the wall. A well-worn, plush toy dragon, missing an eye, sat sentinel on a bookshelf crammed with textbooks and parenting guides. The air smelled faintly of lavender essential oil (Ellie's attempt to create a calming atmosphere) and stale coffee. The sounds of children laughing and shouting from the nearby playground drifted in through the thin walls, a constant reminder of the joy and chaos she navigated daily.

**Opening:**

The shrill ring of the telephone sliced through the otherwise relative quiet of Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth's Friday afternoon. She sighed, pushing back from her cluttered desk, the squeak of her rolling chair echoing in the tiny space. Her fingers, stained with ink from grading endless behavioral checklists, hovered over the receiver. She'd been *this* close to finishing her paperwork for the week, escaping before the weekend descended into a whirlwind of grocery shopping and laundry. Now, the insistent ringing promised something else entirely.

"Ellie Ainsworth, school psychologist," she answered, her voice a carefully modulated blend of professional warmth and weariness.

The voice on the other end was breathless, laced with a palpable fear. "Dr. Ainsworth? This is Mrs. Henderson, in fourth grade? It's about Billyâ€¦"
