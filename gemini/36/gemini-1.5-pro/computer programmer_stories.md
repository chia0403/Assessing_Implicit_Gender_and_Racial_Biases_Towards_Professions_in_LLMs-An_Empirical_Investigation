He was deep in the digital trenches, wrestling with a particularly stubborn algorithm for the Sensorium Corporation, a company that specialized in immersive virtual reality experiences.

Tonight, fueled by lukewarm coffee and the relentless pressure of a looming deadline, Elias was determined to crack the code, even if it meant pulling another all-nighter. The fate of Sensorium's latest project, a highly anticipated VR world called "Elysium," rested, quite literally, on his fingertips.
