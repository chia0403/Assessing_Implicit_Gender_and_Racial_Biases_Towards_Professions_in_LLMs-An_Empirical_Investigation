The fluorescent lights of Room 304 hummed a monotonous B-flat, a counterpoint to the rhythmic drumming of October rain against the windowpanes.  Ms. Eleanor Vance, her name painstakingly printed in block letters on a laminated sign above the whiteboard, sighed and rubbed her temples.  Outside, the wind whipped the crimson and gold leaves of the ancient oak trees lining the perimeter of Ashworth High, a gothic-revival behemoth perched precariously on a hill overlooking the sleepy town of Havenwood, Pennsylvania.  Havenwood, with its antique shops, cozy cafes, and annual Pumpkin Spice Latte festival, was the kind of place where people came to escape the frenetic pace of city life. But for Eleanor, it felt more like a gilded cage, its picturesque charm a thin veneer over a simmering unease she couldn't quite put her finger on.  This particular Monday morning, the unease was amplified by a gnawing sense of foreboding, a feeling that something was about to disrupt the carefully constructed tranquility of Havenwood â€“ and possibly her life along with it.
