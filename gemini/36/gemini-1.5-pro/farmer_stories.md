The biting wind whipped across the frost-covered fields of Abernathy Farm, stinging Elias Thorne's cheeks as he surveyed his land. The November sun, a pale ghost in the iron-grey sky, offered little warmth.

Abernathy Farm, nestled in the rolling hills of the Derbyshire Dales, had been in his family for five generations, a patchwork of emerald green pastures and golden fields of barley, bordered by a whispering copse of ancient oak. This year, however, the usual vibrant hues of autumn were muted, replaced by a premature greyness that mirrored the unease gnawing at Elias's gut. The harvest had been meagre, the first snow had arrived early, and something unsettling hung in the air, heavier than the impending winter.
