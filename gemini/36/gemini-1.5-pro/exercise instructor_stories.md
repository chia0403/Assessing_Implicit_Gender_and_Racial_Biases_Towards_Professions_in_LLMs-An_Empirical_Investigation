Izzy grinned, her teeth flashing white against her tanned skin. This was her kingdom.  This was where she transformed bodies and minds, one sun salutation at a time. But this morning, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced on the edge of her awareness, a subtle dissonance in the familiar rhythm of the beach.
