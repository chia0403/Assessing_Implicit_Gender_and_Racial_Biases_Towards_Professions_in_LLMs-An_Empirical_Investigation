The rhythmic clatter of the typewriter keys was the soundtrack to Amelia Grace Hawthorne's existence. It punctuated the hushed, sterile atmosphere of the Grimshaw Building, a granite behemoth that clawed its way into the perpetually overcast Seattle sky.  Rain lashed against the window beside her desk, a relentless drumming that mirrored the persistent ache in her temples. From her perch on the 27th floor, the city below was a blurred watercolor of grey and green, the iconic Space Needle barely visible through the swirling mist.

The whispers about him – his eccentric demands, his mercurial temper, his unsettling habit of staring out the window for hours on end – echoed through the hushed corridors like phantom footsteps.
