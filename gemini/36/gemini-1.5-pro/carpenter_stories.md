The scent of pine shavings and sawdust hung heavy in the air, mingling with the crisp, pre-dawn chill.  A sliver of pale sunlight, just beginning to crest over the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains, illuminated the interior of the small, cluttered workshop.

Elias's workshop, perched precariously on stilts at the edge of Whisperwind Cliff, overlooked the sprawling, mist-shrouded valley of Atheria, a land known for its whispering forests and capricious winds. This morning, however, the valley held its breath, an unusual stillness settling over the land that made the hairs on the back of Elias's neck prickle with unease.
