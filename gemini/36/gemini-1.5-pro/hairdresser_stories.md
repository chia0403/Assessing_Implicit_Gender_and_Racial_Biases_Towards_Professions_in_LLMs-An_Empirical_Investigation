The biting November wind whipped around Henrietta "Etta" Dubois, stinging her cheeks as she hurried down Bleecker Street, her worn leather satchel bumping against her hip. Above her, the skeletal branches of the sycamores lining the street clawed at the bruised twilight sky.  Etta pulled her crimson scarf tighter around her neck, the scent of woodsmoke and roasting chestnuts filling the air, a comforting counterpoint to the chill.  Her destination, a small, brightly lit salon called "Shear Radiance," nestled between a vintage bookstore and a perpetually bustling Italian deli, was a beacon of warmth in the encroaching darkness.  Etta, owner and sole stylist, was late. Again. Mrs. Rosenblatt, a woman whose weekly perm was as rigid and unchanging as her political opinions, would not be pleased.
