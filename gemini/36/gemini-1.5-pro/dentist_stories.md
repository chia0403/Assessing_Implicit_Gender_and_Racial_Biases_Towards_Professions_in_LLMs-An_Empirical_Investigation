The salt spray stung Dr. Eleanor Vance's face as she wrestled the rusted latch of her clinic's door.  Seabrook, Oregon, wasn't exactly known for its gentle climate, and the November wind howled through the gaps in the weather-beaten clapboard siding of her small, single-story building. The "Seabrook Smiles" sign, hand-painted by her late father, creaked rhythmically above the door, the cheerful blue paint chipped and faded like a forgotten memory.  Inside, the waiting room, small and sparsely furnished with driftwood chairs and a threadbare rug depicting a whimsical octopus, smelled faintly of antiseptic and the perpetually damp wool of the fishermen who made up the majority of her patients.  Eleanor, bundled in a thick, cable-knit sweater the colour of seafoam, sighed, the sound swallowed by the roar of the ocean just a block away. This was her life now, a far cry from the gleaming, state-of-the-art practice she'd envisioned during her years at dental school. But it was home, or as close to it as she'd found since her father's passing.
