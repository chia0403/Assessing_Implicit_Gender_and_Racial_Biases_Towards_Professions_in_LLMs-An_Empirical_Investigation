Tonight, the contrast felt particularly sharp.  The warm glow spilling from the arched windows of the operating theatre beckoned him, promising a battle against the encroaching darkness, a fight Dr. Thorne knew all too well.  He pushed through the heavy oak doors, the scent of antiseptic and fear hitting him with the force of a physical blow.  Tonight, a life hung in the balance, and Elias Thorne, with his steady hands and unwavering focus, was the only one who could tip the scales.
