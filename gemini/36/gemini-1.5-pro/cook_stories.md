The clatter of pans and the fragrant sizzle of garlic filled the galley kitchen of "The Wandering Wave," a weather-beaten fishing trawler currently moored in the choppy waters off the coast of Newfoundland.  Amelia Rose Blackwood, her fiery red hair escaping from beneath a stained bandana, expertly flipped a thick cod fillet in a cast iron skillet.  Outside, the November wind howled like a banshee, rattling the portholes and sending sprays of icy Atlantic seawater across the deck. The sky was a bruised purple, promising snow before nightfall. Amelia, despite the rough seas and the impending storm, hummed a cheerful sea shanty, her focus entirely on creating a hearty meal for the weary crew returning from their long, frigid day battling the waves.  The galley, a cramped space dominated by the ancient stove and a scarred wooden table, was her kingdom, and the aroma of her cooking, a beacon in this harsh, unforgiving world.
