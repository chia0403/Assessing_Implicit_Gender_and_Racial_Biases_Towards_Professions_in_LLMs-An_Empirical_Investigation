The crimson velvet curtains of the Blue Moon Cabaret shivered, a tremor of anticipation rippling through the smoky haze.  Rain lashed against the grime-streaked windows, a mournful soundtrack to the pre-show jitters.  Inside, the air hung thick with the perfume of cheap cologne, stale beer, and the faint metallic tang of fear.  This was Amelia Rose Blackwood's stage, her sanctuary, and tonight, it felt more like a cage.  The worn microphone stand, usually a comforting presence, seemed to mock her, reflecting the flickering gaslight in a malevolent wink.  Amelia, dressed in a sequined gown the color of a bruised plum, traced the outline of a chipped ruby ring on her finger, a nervous habit she couldn't seem to break.  Tonight wasn't just any performance; tonight, a man from the prestigious Odeon Theatre was in the audience.  This was her chance to escape the Blue Moon, to finally reach for the stars that shimmered just beyond the rain-slicked streets of New Orleans.
