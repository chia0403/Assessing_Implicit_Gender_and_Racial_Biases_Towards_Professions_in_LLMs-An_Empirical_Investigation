The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the Salty Siren, a rhythm that usually soothed Amelia "Amy" Reyes. Tonight, however, it just mirrored the throbbing ache in her temples.  The Siren, perched precariously on the edge of a crumbling cliff overlooking the churning grey expanse of the North Atlantic, usually bustled with tourists and locals alike, drawn in by the promise of fresh seafood and stunning, if frequently tempestuous, ocean views.  But tonight, the only occupants were Amy, wiping down the sticky remnants of spilled clam chowder from a deserted table, and old Silas, the barman, polishing glasses with a practiced hand and humming a mournful sea shanty.  The wind howled outside, rattling the mismatched windows, and the air hung heavy with the smell of salt, seaweed, and impending storm.
