The neon glow of the Desert Rose Diner spilled out onto the cracked asphalt of Highway 17, painting the swirling dust devils a lurid pink.  A semi, its chrome gleaming under the sickly light, growled to a stop beside a rusted-out pickup truck.  Inside the cab, Amelia “Amy” Rodriguez, her knuckles white against the worn leather of the steering wheel, let out a long sigh.  The air brakes hissed, a lonely sound in the vast emptiness of the Mojave Desert.  The clock on the dash blinked 3:17 AM.  Amy had been driving for fourteen hours straight, a double-shot of stale coffee her only companion.  The diner, a beacon of greasy hope in a landscape of scrub brush and tumbleweeds, promised a hot meal and a few precious minutes of respite before the next leg of her haul to Phoenix.  But as she climbed down from the cab, the desert wind whispering a mournful tune, Amy felt a prickle of unease, a sense that this particular stop might be more than just a quick coffee break.
