The air in "Nailed It," Eliza Jane Peterson's salon, hung thick and sweet with the scent of acetone and hibiscus.  Eliza Jane, a woman whose smile could mend a broken nail and whose gossip could shatter a reputation, perched on a rolling stool, a tiny jeweled drill whirring in her hand. Outside, the humid Miami air shimmered above the cracked asphalt of Calle Ocho, the vibrant pulse of Little Havana throbbing just beyond the salon's brightly painted turquoise door. Sunlight, filtered through the sheer curtains adorned with flamingoes, splashed across the worn linoleum floor in a kaleidoscope of tropical hues.  A salsa rhythm drifted from the panaderia next door, competing with the steady hum of the nail dryer and the murmur of telenovelas playing on the small, wall-mounted television. This Tuesday morning was shaping up to be just like any other, until Mrs. Rodriguez, the salon's most loyal (and most gossipy) client, walked in with a face paler than unbuffed acrylics and a story that promised to be more explosive than a glitter bomb.
