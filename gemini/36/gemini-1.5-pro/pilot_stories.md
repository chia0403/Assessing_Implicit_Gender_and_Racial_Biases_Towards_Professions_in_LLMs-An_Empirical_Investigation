The biting Alaskan wind whipped at Amelia "Ace" Reyes's flight jacket as she prepped the de Havilland Beaver for takeoff.  Glacier-carved peaks, dusted with fresh snow, ringed the frozen Lake Clark, their reflections shimmering like shattered diamonds on the glassy surface.  The air, crisp and clean, carried the scent of pine and the faint, metallic tang of ice.  Amelia adjusted her fur-lined hood, the breath from her lungs clouding momentarily before dissipating into the frigid morning.  Her destination: a remote research outpost nestled deep within the Wrangell-St. Elias National Park, a place accessible only by air during the long winter months.  The cargo: vital supplies and a single, enigmatic passenger who'd booked the flight with barely a word spoken and paid entirely in cash.  Amelia, ever practical, hadn't questioned it much.  Flying in this unforgiving wilderness was a lonely business, and a little mystery was sometimes a welcome distraction.
