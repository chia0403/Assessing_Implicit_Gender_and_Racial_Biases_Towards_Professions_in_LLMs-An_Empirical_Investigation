The biting wind whipped off Lake Superior, stinging Dr. Elias Thorne's cheeks as he hurried across the cobblestone street. The late November air in Duluth, Minnesota, had a way of freezing exposed skin in seconds, a stark contrast to the warmth radiating from the brick buildings lining the waterfront. He tugged his scarf tighter, the wool scratching against his beard, and ducked inside the frosted glass doors of Northern Lights Rehabilitation Center. The bell above the door jingled cheerfully, a sound strangely at odds with the gray, brooding sky outside. Inside, the air hummed with quiet activity; the low whir of a treadmill, the murmur of voices, the clink of weights. Elias inhaled the familiar scent of antiseptic and sweat, a scent he'd come to associate with healing and hope.
