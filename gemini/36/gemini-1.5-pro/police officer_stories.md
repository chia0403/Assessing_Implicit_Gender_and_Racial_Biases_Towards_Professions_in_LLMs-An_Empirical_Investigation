A pulsing red and blue strobe light reflected in the slick, black puddles gathered in the potholes of South Wallace Avenue, illuminating a dark stain spreading across the cracked concrete – a stain that Izzy knew, with a sickening certainty, was blood.  This was her third homicide in as many weeks, and the gnawing feeling in her gut told her this one was going to be particularly nasty.
