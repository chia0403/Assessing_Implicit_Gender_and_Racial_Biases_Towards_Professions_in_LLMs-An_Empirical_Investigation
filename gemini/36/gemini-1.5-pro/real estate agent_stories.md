The crisp October air, scented with woodsmoke and decaying leaves, whipped Amelia Hayes's auburn hair across her face as she wrestled a "SOLD" sign from the back of her Subaru.  Perched precariously on the verge of a muddy ditch overlooking the sprawling, ramshackle Victorian known locally as Blackwood Manor, Amelia felt a shiver crawl down her spine that had nothing to do with the temperature.  Nestled deep in the Catskill Mountains, just outside the sleepy town of Hollow Creek, the property had been on the market for nearly a decade.  Its peeling paint, overgrown gardens, and whispered rumors of eccentric previous owners had deterred even the most intrepid of house-hunters.  Amelia, however, specialized in the unusual.  She saw potential where others saw problems, and in Blackwood Manor, she saw a masterpiece waiting to be unearthed.  This sale, more than any other in her career, had the potential to catapult her from small-town realtor to a name whispered with reverence in the hallowed halls of Hudson Valley real estate.  But as the wind howled through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks surrounding the house, a sense of unease settled in Amelia's stomach.  Something about Blackwood Manor feltâ€¦different.
