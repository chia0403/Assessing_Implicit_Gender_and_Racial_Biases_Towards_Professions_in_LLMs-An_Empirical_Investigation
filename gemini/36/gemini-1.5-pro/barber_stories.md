The air in the Bartholomew's Blades barbershop hung thick with the aroma of bay rum and talcum powder, a scent that clung to the burgundy leather chairs like a second skin. Rain lashed against the large window overlooking Finchley Road, turning the London streetlights into hazy, shimmering halos.  It was a Tuesday evening in late November, the kind of evening that burrowed deep into your bones and made you crave a warm fire and a stronger drink than usual.  Elijah Finch, proprietor and sole barber of Bartholomew's Blades, wiped down his straight razor with a practiced hand, the rhythmic swish a counterpoint to the drumming of the rain. He glanced at the vintage clock on the wall â€“ 7:52 pm.  Nearly closing time, and thankfully, no more customers scheduled. He was looking forward to a quiet evening with a good book and a cup of Earl Grey.  He just hoped the leaky roof wouldn't dampen his plans, literally or figuratively.
