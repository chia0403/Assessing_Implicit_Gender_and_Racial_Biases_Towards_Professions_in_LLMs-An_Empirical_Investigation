The rain hammered against the arched windows of Amelia Rosalind Thorne's office, each drop a tiny explosion against the leaded glass.  Her office, perched high in the clock tower of the Wainwright Building in St. Louis, normally offered a breathtaking panorama of the Gateway City. Tonight, however, the view was swallowed by a swirling, grey tempest. Lightning split the sky, briefly illuminating the Art Nouveau flourishes of the room: the swirling, organic lines of the desk, the stylized floral patterns woven into the rug, even the delicate brass frame holding a photograph of her late grandfather, Judge Elias Thorne. Amelia, her dark hair pulled back in a severe knot, tapped a slender finger against a thick file labelled "The Estate of Silas Blackwood." The Blackwood case, a tangled mess of contested wills, hidden clauses, and feuding relatives, had consumed her for months. Tonight, with the storm raging outside and the city lights obscured, the weight of it pressed down on her with particular force.  A flicker of movement in the reflection of the window caught her eye.  She turned, half expecting to see only the distorted image of her own tense face, but insteadâ€¦ a shadow detached itself from the corner of the room.
