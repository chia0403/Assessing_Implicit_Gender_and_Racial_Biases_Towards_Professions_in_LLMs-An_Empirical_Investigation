The rhythmic *snick-snack* of shears biting through cloth filled the air of Elias Finch's small tailor shop, a counterpoint to the incessant drizzle drumming against the leaded glass windows. Finch’s Tailor Shop and Haberdashery nestled between a bustling fishmonger and a perpetually gloomy apothecary on Crow Lane, a narrow cobblestone street in the perpetually fog-shrouded city of Aethelburg.  Gas lamps, hissing faintly, cast a warm glow on bolts of velvet, tweed, and silk stacked haphazardly against the walls. Elias, a man of slender build with needle-pricked fingers and eyes the colour of weathered slate, meticulously cut a length of midnight blue velvet, the fabric shimmering like captured starlight under the gaslight. The scent of pipe tobacco, bay leaves, and something faintly metallic – the scent of shears constantly sharpened against a whetstone – hung heavy in the air.  Outside, the fog, thick as cotton wool, swirled and eddied, muffling the distant cries of street vendors and the clatter of carriage wheels on cobblestone. It was a Thursday, and Thursdays in Aethelburg were notoriously quiet, a lull before the frenetic activity of the weekend market. Elias preferred it that way. It gave him time to think, to create, and to lose himself in the whisper of the cloth. He hadn't expected a customer on such a dreary afternoon, much less the customer who presently pushed open his shop door, letting in a gust of damp air and the jangling chime of a small bell.
