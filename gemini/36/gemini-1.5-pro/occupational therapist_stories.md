The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Reyes's dark hair across her face as she hurried down Bleecker Street, the scent of roasted chestnuts battling with the exhaust fumes for dominance.  Her burgundy satchel, overflowing with therapy putty, fidget toys, and assessment forms, thumped against her hip with each hurried step. Amy, a registered occupational therapist at the Greenwich Village Rehabilitation Center, was late.  Not disastrously late, but late enough to make her stomach clench with that familiar mix of guilt and anxiety.  The gothic revival architecture of the Center loomed ahead, its sandstone façade darkened by years of city grime and the encroaching twilight.  Inside, a kaleidoscope of human stories unfolded daily – stories of stroke survivors relearning to hold a toothbrush, children with autism navigating sensory overload, and amputees finding new ways to engage with the world. Amy loved her work, loved the intricate puzzle of each patient’s recovery, but today, a new case file weighed heavy on her mind. A celebrated concert pianist, Elias Vance, had lost the use of his left hand in a car accident. The file hinted at a complex personality and a fierce resistance to therapy. Amy took a deep breath, bracing herself for the challenge, and pushed open the heavy oak doors. The warm, antiseptic smell of the clinic wrapped around her, a stark contrast to the icy air outside.  It was going to be a long evening.
