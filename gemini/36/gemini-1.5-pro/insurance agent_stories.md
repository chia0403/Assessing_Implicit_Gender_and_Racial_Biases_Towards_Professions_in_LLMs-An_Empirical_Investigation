Rain lashed against the stained-glass window of The Gilded Gryphon, depicting a creature that looked more like a drowned rat than a majestic mythical beast.  Inside, the pub was warm and fuggy, smelling of damp wool and stale beer.  Bartholomew "Barty" Higgins, a perpetually rumpled insurance agent with the unfortunate habit of attracting misfortune like a moth to a flickering flame, shivered despite the thick tweed coat he wore. He hunched over a pint of lukewarm bitter, the condensation clinging to the glass like persistent regrets.  The small Norfolk town of Dunsany was usually quiet, even on a Saturday night, but tonight, a palpable tension hung in the air, thicker than the cigarette smoke curling towards the low, beamed ceiling. Barty, a man more accustomed to dealing with mundane claims of broken washing machines and dented bumpers, felt a prickle of unease, a sensation he usually only experienced before a particularly disastrous appraisal of a flooded basement.  Something was different tonight in Dunsany.  Something was wrong.
