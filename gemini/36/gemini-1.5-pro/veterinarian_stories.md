The biting wind whipped off the North Atlantic, carrying the scent of salt and something vaguely fishy, clinging to Dr. Elias Thorne like a damp shroud.  He hunched deeper into his thick wool coat, the collar scratching against his unshaven jaw.  The sky, a bruised purple streaked with angry grey, threatened snow.  Elias squinted against the gathering gloom, the lighthouse on Gull Rock a flickering, skeletal finger pointing accusingly at the churning sea.  Around him, the small, ramshackle buildings of Port Blossom, Newfoundland, huddled together for warmth, their paint peeling like sunburnt skin.  It wasn't the kind of evening that inspired hope, even for a vet accustomed to life and death in its rawest forms.  Especially not when the call had come from Old Man Finnigan, whose pronouncements of doom were usually as reliable as the tides.
