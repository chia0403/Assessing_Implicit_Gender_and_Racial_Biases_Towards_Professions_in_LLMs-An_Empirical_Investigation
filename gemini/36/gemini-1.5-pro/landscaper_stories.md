The biting November wind whipped at Amelia “Millie” Reyes’s cheeks, chapping them despite the thick layer of moisturizer she’d slathered on that morning.  Her gloved hands dug into the damp earth, pulling stubborn dandelion weeds from Mrs. Henderson's prize-winning rose bushes.  The air smelled of wet leaves and the faint, metallic tang of approaching snow.  Millie's breath puffed out in white clouds, momentarily obscuring the view of the manicured lawns and meticulously pruned hedges that defined the affluent neighborhood of Oakhaven Heights, nestled in the rolling hills just outside of Philadelphia. The late afternoon sun, a pale disc hanging low in the bruised-purple sky, cast long, skeletal shadows of the oak trees that lent the area its name.  Each house, a testament to wealth and impeccable taste, boasted its own perfectly landscaped territory, a canvas Millie had, in some way, helped create and maintain.  Today, however,  a sense of unease prickled beneath her skin, a feeling as persistent as the creeping cold.  It wasn’t just the impending winter or the usual pre-holiday rush; it was something else, something unsettling that hummed beneath the surface of the seemingly perfect suburb.
