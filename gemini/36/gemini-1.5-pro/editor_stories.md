Rain lashed against the arched windows of Amelia Thorne's attic apartment, mimicking the tempest brewing inside her.  The Parisian rooftops, normally a charming vista, were obscured by a swirling grey mist.  Inside, stacks of manuscripts teetered precariously on every surface, threatening to avalanche onto the worn Persian rug.
