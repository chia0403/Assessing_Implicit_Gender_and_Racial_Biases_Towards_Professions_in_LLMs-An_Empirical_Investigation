The biting November wind whipped around Eleanor Vance as she hurried across the cracked asphalt of the St. Jude's School playground.  Fallen leaves, the color of burnt caramel and rusted pennies, swirled around her ankles. The air smelled of woodsmoke and impending snow. Grey clouds, heavy with the promise of precipitation, pressed down on the small town of Havenwood, Maine, making the late afternoon feel like dusk.  St. Jude's, a squat, brick building with chipped paint around the window frames, sat perched on a small rise overlooking the town.  From the playground, Eleanor could see the flickering lights in the windows of the houses below, cozy havens against the encroaching cold.  She shivered, pulling her worn wool coat tighter around her, and glanced at her watch. 4:45 pm. Fifteen minutes past the last bell.  Daniel still hadn't shown up.
