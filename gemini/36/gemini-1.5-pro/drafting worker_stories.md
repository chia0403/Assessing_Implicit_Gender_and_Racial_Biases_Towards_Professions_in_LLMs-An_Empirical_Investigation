The fluorescent lights of Thornton & Sons Architectural Design hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Reyes' life. Amelia, whose full name was Amelia Isabella Reyes, squinted at the blueprint spread across her drafting table, the faint smell of ammonia from the printing room clinging to the air. Outside, the Chicago wind howled, rattling the large windows that overlooked the bustling cityscape.  It was late November, the kind of cold that seeped into your bones, and the early dusk cast long shadows across the room, transforming the precise lines of her drawings into a geometric maze.  The only other sounds besides the hum and the wind were the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Amelia's pencil and the occasional muffled cough from Mr. Henderson, the senior draftsman, hidden behind a mountain of rolled-up plans in the corner. The office was a sterile environment of beige walls, steel desks, and the constant, low thrum of ambition and deadlines.  For Amelia, it was a cage, albeit a familiar one.  She longed for the vibrant colors of the cityscapes she meticulously rendered in grayscale, for the warmth of a life beyond the cool precision of her work.
