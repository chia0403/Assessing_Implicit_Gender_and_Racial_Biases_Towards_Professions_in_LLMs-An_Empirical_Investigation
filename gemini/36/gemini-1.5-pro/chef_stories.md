The clatter of aluminum pans was a morning symphony to Theodore "Theo" Augustine Dubois.  He stood in the pre-dawn chill of the Rue de l'Espoir, the faint Parisian sunrise painting the cobblestones a dusky lavender.

This morning, however, the usual comforting rhythm of preparation was punctuated by a knot of anxiety in Theo's stomach. Today wasn't just any Tuesday; it was the day Antoine Vereaux, the most ruthless food critic in Paris, was coming to Le Papillon Bleu.
