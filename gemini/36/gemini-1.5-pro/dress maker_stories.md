The biting November wind howled down Grimshaw Lane, rattling the frosted panes of Elsie Hepworth's small shop.  Inside, nestled between a haberdashery and a butcher shop that perpetually smelled of sawdust and sausage, "Hepworth's Hems & Habiliments" glowed with a warm, inviting light. Elsie, her full name Elsie Amelia Hepworth, a woman whose spirit was as bright as the crimson velvet she was currently draping on a dress form, hummed a cheerful tune despite the grim weather.  The air inside was thick with the scent of steaming tea, beeswax, and the faint, sweet perfume of lavender sachets tucked amongst bolts of silk, linen, and wool.  Grimshaw, a small, tightly-knit mill town nestled in the Yorkshire Dales, rarely saw such flamboyant fabrics, but Elsie, with her city-trained eye and a heart full of dreams, was determined to bring a splash of colour to its otherwise grey existence.
