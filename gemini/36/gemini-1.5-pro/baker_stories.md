The aroma of cardamom and yeast hung thick in the air, a comforting blanket against the pre-dawn chill.  A sliver of apricot sunlight peeked through the gap in the curtains of Rosemary Clementine's bakery, "The Sugarplum & Spice."  Located on the cobbled corner of Lavender Lane and Marigold Street in the whimsical town of Harmony Glade, the bakery was a haven of warmth and sweetness. Rosemary, her flour-dusted apron tied tight, hummed a lilting tune as she kneaded a mound of dough, her strong hands working with practiced ease.  Outside, the sleepy town was just beginning to stir, the only sounds the gentle clatter of milk bottles being delivered and the distant chirping of robins.  But inside The Sugarplum & Spice, Rosemary's day had already begun, fueled by passion and a secret recipe for the most magical gingerbread cookies in the world.
