The cabin lights dimmed, casting long shadows down the aisle of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Amelia "Mia" Rodriguez, her navy blue uniform crisp and perfectly pressed, smoothed a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear as she surveyed the passengers settling in for the red-eye from Los Angeles to Tokyo.  The air hummed with the low thrum of the engines spooling up, a familiar lullaby to Mia after ten years soaring through the stratosphere. Outside, the LAX tarmac glittered with a million reflected lights, a stark contrast to the deep indigo of the approaching night.  The scent of stale coffee and something vaguely floral hung in the recycled air, a constant reminder of the enclosed space she navigated with practiced grace. This flight, however, felt different. A prickling sensation danced on the back of her neck, a subtle unease she couldn't quite place. It wasn't the usual pre-flight jitters or the occasional turbulent passenger; this was something else entirely, a whisper of anticipation hanging heavy in the air.
