Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the "Daily Clarion" office, mimicking the tempest brewing inside Amelia Grace Hawthorne.  The flickering fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow across the cluttered room, illuminating crumpled cigarette packs, half-eaten takeout containers, and stacks of newspapers threatening to topple at any moment.  Ashburn, Virginia, usually a sleepy, historic town nestled amongst the rolling hills of Loudoun County, was tonight a swirling vortex of wind and water, mirroring Ameliaâ€™s churning anxiety.  She tapped a chipped, crimson nail against her desk, the rhythmic clicking a counterpoint to the relentless drumming of the rain.  The assignment she'd just been handed, a seemingly innocuous piece on the town's upcoming bicentennial celebration, felt like a lead weight in her gut. Something about the overly enthusiastic town council president and his insistence on the historical accuracy of the festivities had set her journalistic senses tingling.  There was a story here, bigger than a parade and a bake sale.  Amelia could smell it, like the damp earth rising up from the storm-soaked streets outside.
