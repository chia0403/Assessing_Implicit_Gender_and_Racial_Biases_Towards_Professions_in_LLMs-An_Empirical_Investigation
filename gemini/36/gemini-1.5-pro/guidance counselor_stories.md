The fluorescent lights of Northwood High buzzed faintly, a counterpoint to the rhythmic tap-tap-tapping of Dr. Eleanor Vance’s pen against her teeth.  Rain lashed against the window of her small, cluttered office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  Stacks of college applications teetered precariously on her desk, threatening to avalanche onto the worn oriental rug beneath. October in the small, coastal town of Port Blossom, Oregon was typically a kaleidoscope of vibrant autumn leaves and crisp, invigorating air.  This year, however, the weather seemed to reflect the pervasive anxiety clinging to the senior class – an anxiety Dr. Vance, despite her years of experience, felt acutely herself.  This wasn't just another college application season; it was the culmination of everything she'd worked towards with these students, a crescendo of hopes and dreams poised on the precipice of either soaring flight or devastating downfall.  And today,  a particular student was scheduled to walk through her door, a student who held the fragile weight of all that potential in his troubled hands.
