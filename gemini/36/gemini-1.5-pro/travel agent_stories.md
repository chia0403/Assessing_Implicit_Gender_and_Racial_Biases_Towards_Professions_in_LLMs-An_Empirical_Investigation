The insistent chirping of a gecko, hidden somewhere amidst the overflowing philodendrons, was the soundtrack to Amelia Reyes' Tuesday morning.  Sunlight, thick and heavy with humidity, draped over the vibrant turquoise walls of her tiny travel agency, "Wanderlust Whispers," nestled between a laundromat and a pupuseria in Miami's Little Havana. Amelia, her dark curls pulled back in a messy bun, tapped a manicured nail against a chipped ceramic mug, her brow furrowed in concentration as she scrolled through flight options to Reykjavik. The air, usually thick with the scent of cafe cubano from the bakery next door, today carried a faint, unsettling tang of ozone, like the air just before a summer thunderstorm.  Outside, the usual vibrant street life of Calle Ocho seemed muted, the laughter and salsa music replaced by an almost unnerving stillness.  Even the stray cats that usually prowled the alleyway were nowhere to be seen. It was as if the city itself was holding its breath, waiting for something to happen.
