The flickering neon sign of "Shear Radiance Salon" cast a lurid, magenta glow across the rain-slicked streets of downtown Zenith, Ohio. Inside, amidst the scent of hairspray and the hum of dryers, Wednesday Addams Blackwood, a cosmetologist with a penchant for the dramatic and an uncanny ability to sculpt hair into gravity-defying works of art, stared out the window. The downpour mirrored her mood.  Zenith, population barely clinging to five digits, wasn't exactly a hotbed of haute couture. Wednesday, a graduate of the prestigious Vidal Sassoon Academy in London, felt like a rare orchid wilting in a field of dandelions.  This Tuesday evening, usually the salon's busiest, was eerily quiet. Only Mrs. Henderson, a woman whose blue rinse was more vibrant than her personality, occupied one of the styling chairs.  Wednesday tapped a long, black acrylic nail against the glass, a premonition, dark and swirling like the storm clouds outside, beginning to form in her mind.  Something was brewing in Zenith.  And it wasn't just the weather.
