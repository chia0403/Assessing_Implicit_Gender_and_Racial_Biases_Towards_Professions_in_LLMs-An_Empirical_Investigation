The flickering fluorescent lights of St. Augustine's Preparatory School for Boys hummed a lonely tune in the echoing silence.  Dust motes danced in the pale beams, illuminated like tiny galaxies in the vast, empty gymnasium. Outside, a late November wind howled through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks that surrounded the school, their rustling leaves sounding like whispered secrets.  Elias Finch, the school's janitor for the past twenty-seven years, pushed his mop bucket across the polished floor, its squeaky wheels a counterpoint to the wind's lament. He wore his usual faded green uniform, the St. Augustine's crest barely visible on his breast pocket, and a thin layer of sweat beaded on his forehead despite the chill that permeated the cavernous room. Tonight, however, something felt different. A strange stillness hung in the air, heavier than the dust, thicker than the approaching storm. Elias paused, his hand gripping the mop handle, a prickle of unease crawling up his spine.  The gym was never this quiet.
