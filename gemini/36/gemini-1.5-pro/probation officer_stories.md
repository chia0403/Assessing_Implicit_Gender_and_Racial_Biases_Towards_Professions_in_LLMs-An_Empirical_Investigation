The relentless Chicago wind, sharp as broken glass, whipped at Amelia “Amy” Reyes’s trench coat as she navigated the slick, grey streets of Humboldt Park.  Flakes of gritty snow, more sleet than anything festive, stung her face. It was the kind of December afternoon that burrowed deep into your bones and stayed there, just like the gnawing unease Amy felt about her next appointment.  Her breath plumed before her, momentarily obscuring the peeling paint and boarded-up windows of the three-story building that housed the last address on her list for the day: 2712 West North Avenue, apartment 3B.  Inside resided Marco “The Shark” Santana, recently paroled for armed robbery, and a man whose charm was as dangerous as the switchblade he’d once favored. Amy adjusted the worn leather satchel containing Marco’s file, the weight of his past and her responsibility a tangible presence against her side.  This was her fourth visit in as many weeks, and something about Marco's recent compliance felt...off.  Too smooth. Too eager. It was the kind of calm that preceded a storm, and Amy had learned to trust her instincts.  They rarely steered her wrong.
