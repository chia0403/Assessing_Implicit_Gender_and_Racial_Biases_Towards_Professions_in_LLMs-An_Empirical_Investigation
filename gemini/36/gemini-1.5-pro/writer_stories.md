The salt spray kissed Amelia Iris Thorne's face as she leaned against the weathered railing of her porch, the rhythmic crash of waves against the rocky Cornish coast a familiar lullaby.  Perched precariously on a cliff overlooking the churning Atlantic, her cottage, "Seawhisper," was a ramshackle affair of mismatched windows and a roof that perpetually threatened to surrender to the relentless wind.  Inside, amidst stacks of manuscripts and half-empty teacups, a fire crackled merrily in the hearth, casting flickering shadows on the walls lined with overflowing bookshelves.  October had arrived on the wind, bringing with it the scent of woodsmoke and the promise of long, stormy nights â€“ the perfect conditions, Amelia believed, for finishing her latest novel.  A gothic mystery, steeped in Cornish folklore and shrouded in the mists of the moors, it had been a demanding mistress, consuming her days and haunting her dreams.  But tonight, a stubborn block in the narrative had left her restless, the words trapped like seabirds in a net, refusing to take flight.
