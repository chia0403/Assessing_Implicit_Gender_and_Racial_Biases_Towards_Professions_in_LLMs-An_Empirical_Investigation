The frosted breath of November clawed at the leaded windows of the Parnassus Public Library, etching fleeting patterns across the glass. Inside, nestled amongst the towering shelves that groaned beneath the weight of untold stories, Amelia Iris Thorne shivered despite the crackling fire in the hearth. Parnassus, nestled deep in the Vermont mountains, was a town that embraced winter with a chilling enthusiasm.  Amelia, the head librarian for the past fifteen years, usually found solace in the hushed quiet of the library, surrounded by the comforting scent of aging paper and leather.  But tonight, a disquiet hummed beneath the usual stillness, a premonition prickling at the edges of her awareness like a loose thread in a well-loved cardigan. The only other person in the library, old Mr. Hemlock, snored gently in his usual armchair by the fireplace, a half-finished copy of "Moby Dick" splayed across his lap.  The grandfather clock in the corner chimed seven times, its resonant tones swallowed by the thick silence that had settled over Parnassus.  Something was different. Something was wrong.
