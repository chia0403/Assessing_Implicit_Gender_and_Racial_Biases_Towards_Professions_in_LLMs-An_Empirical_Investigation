The biting November wind, sharp as a freshly honed axe, whipped through the towering pines of the Bitterroot Mountains, Montana.  Frost crunched under Elijah Jedediah Blackwood's heavy boots as he trudged through the pre-dawn gloom, the beam of his headlamp cutting a meager swathe through the swirling snow flurries.  The air, thick with the scent of pine resin and damp earth, hung heavy in his lungs.  Elijah, a man built like an oak, with hands calloused and scarred like a weathered map, adjusted the thick wool cap pulled low over his ears.  Dawn was still a hesitant promise on the horizon, but the whine of the approaching skidder already echoed through the valley, a mechanical beast heralding the start of another long, arduous day in the timberlands.  Above him, the skeletal branches of a ponderosa pine swayed, laden with snow, a stark reminder of the power of the wilderness that Elijah both respected and relied on for his livelihood. The logging camp, a cluster of prefabricated buildings and trailers huddled at the base of Old Baldy Mountain, was his temporary home, a world of roaring chainsaws, gruff camaraderie, and the constant, low thrum of hard labor.
