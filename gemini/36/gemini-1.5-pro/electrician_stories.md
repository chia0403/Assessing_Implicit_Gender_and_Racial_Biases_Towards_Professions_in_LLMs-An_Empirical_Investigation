The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorne, snagging at the edges of his high-vis jacket as he surveyed the half-finished wind turbine.  Ice crystals glittered on the steel latticework, catching the weak afternoon sun and throwing fractured rainbows across the bleak, Lincolnshire landscape.  Below him, the flat fenland stretched out, a patchwork of frozen fields and drainage ditches, punctuated by the occasional skeletal tree.  The nearest village, Kirton-in-Lindsey, huddled a mile or so away, its lights a faint glimmer in the gathering dusk.  Elias tightened his grip on his toolbox, the cold metal biting into his gloved hand.  Heâ€™d been up here for hours, wrestling with a faulty sensor, and the promise of a warm pub and a pint was the only thing keeping him from packing it in and calling it a day.  This turbine, number seven in the Black Fen Wind Farm array, was proving to be more trouble than the rest combined.  And Elias, being the most experienced electrician on the project, was the only one who could fix it.
