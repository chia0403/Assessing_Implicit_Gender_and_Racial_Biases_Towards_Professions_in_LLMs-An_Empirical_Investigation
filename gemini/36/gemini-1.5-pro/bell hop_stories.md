The revolving door of the Grand Majestic Hotel sighed a gust of chilled, rain-slicked air onto Elias Finch, momentarily plastering his crisp navy uniform to his lean frame. Elias, barely seventeen and already weary beyond his years, straightened his pillbox cap and forced a smile onto a face that felt perpetually stuck on 'politely neutral'.  The Grand Majestic, a towering Art Deco behemoth that clawed at the bruised Chicago sky, was a world of gleaming marble, hushed whispers, and the heavy scent of money â€“ a world Elias merely orbited, never truly inhabiting. Tonight, the lobby glittered with the pre-show buzz of a gala benefiting the city's opera house.  Diamond necklaces winked under the chandeliers, champagne flutes chimed like nervous laughter, and the air vibrated with the low hum of expectant conversation. Elias, his brass luggage trolley gleaming under the opulent lights, braced himself for another night of fleeting glimpses into lives he could only dream of.
