The bell above the door to "Petal & Stem" tinkled a melancholic two-note chime as the last customer of the day departed, leaving Eleanor Ainsworth alone amongst the fragrant chaos of her shop.  Outside, the November rain lashed against the large bay window, blurring the already fading light of the late afternoon into a hazy grey.  Petal & Stem, nestled between a bustling bakery and a perpetually empty storefront on Sycamore Street, was Eleanor’s sanctuary, a vibrant splash of color in the otherwise muted palette of the small Oregon town of Alder Creek.  Buckets overflowing with dahlias, roses, and lilies lined the walls, their perfume a heady mix that hung in the air, a stark contrast to the damp, earthy scent that seeped in from the street.  Eleanor, her hands stained a gentle green from stripping thorns, surveyed her domain, a small smile playing on her lips.  This wasn’t just a flower shop; it was a repository of stories waiting to be told, each bloom whispering secrets of joy, sorrow, and everything in between.  Tonight, however, a different kind of story was about to unfold, one that wouldn't involve roses or ribbons, but something far more… unsettling.
