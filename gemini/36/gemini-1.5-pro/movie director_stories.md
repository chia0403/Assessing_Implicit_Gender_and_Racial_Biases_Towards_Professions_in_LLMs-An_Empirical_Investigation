The biting November wind whipped around  Cassandra “Cass”  Valdez, sending her thick, black hair swirling across her face like a rogue curtain. She tugged her cashmere scarf tighter, the damp chill seeping through her expensive wool coat as if it were tissue paper.  Below her, Times Square roared – a cacophony of honking taxis, chattering tourists, and the incessant rumble of the subway. From her vantage point on the rooftop bar of the Hotel Edison, the city lights blurred into a hypnotic, shimmering tapestry.  Cass, however, saw none of it.  Her gaze was fixed on a single flickering neon sign across the street – a faded, art deco relic advertising a long-closed burlesque theatre.  It was that specific shade of faded turquoise, a colour she'd only ever seen in pre-1950s film stock, that had drawn her to this rooftop, to this moment, to the cusp of her most ambitious and potentially ruinous project yet.
