Rain lashed against the leaded windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's study, mimicking the relentless drumming in his head.  The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the shelves crammed with leather-bound tomes on criminology and the darker recesses of the human psyche.  November 1888 had descended upon London like a shroud, clinging to the fog-choked streets and seeping into the very bones of the city.  Fear, thick and palpable, hung in the air, fueled by whispered tales of a phantom stalking Whitechapel's shadowed alleys.  Elias, his brow furrowed in concentration, traced the jagged edges of a recent crime scene photograph with a trembling finger.  The image depicted a gruesome tableau â€“ the fifth victim attributed to the fiend the press had christened "Jack the Ripper."  Each murder more savage than the last, each a chilling testament to a mind steeped in darkness.
