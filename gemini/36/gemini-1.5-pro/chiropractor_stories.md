The rain hammered against the leaded glass window of Dr. Elias Thorne’s chiropractic clinic, mimicking the persistent thrumming in his own temples.  The "Thorne Chiropractic & Wellness Center," a name his excessively enthusiastic marketing consultant had insisted upon, was usually a haven of soothing sandalwood incense and the gentle burble of a desktop fountain. But tonight, with the wind howling like a banshee and the rain lashing against the brick façade, it felt more like a ship caught in a squall. Elias, a tall man with hands that seemed both impossibly strong and preternaturally gentle, rubbed at the knot of tension in his neck, a familiar ache that seemed to settle in whenever the weather turned foul. He glanced at the antique clock ticking steadily on the wall – 11:57 pm. He was due to close hours ago, but Mrs. Petrov, a woman whose spine seemed determined to defy the laws of physics, had required an extra, particularly complex adjustment.  Now, alone in the echoing quiet of the clinic, located on a quiet, tree-lined street in the otherwise bustling heart of Oakhaven, Illinois,  Elias had the unsettling feeling that the storm raging outside was nothing compared to the one about to break loose inside.
