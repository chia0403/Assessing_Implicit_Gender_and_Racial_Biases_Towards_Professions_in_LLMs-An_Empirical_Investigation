The opulent lobby of the Hotel Magnifique shimmered, a kaleidoscope of polished marble, crystal chandeliers, and the hushed murmur of affluent guests.  Rain lashed against the arched windows overlooking the Place Vendôme, turning the Parisian twilight into a hazy, impressionistic painting.  Inside, however, all was warmth and hushed elegance.  A fire crackled merrily in the oversized hearth, casting flickering shadows across the plush velvet seating.  This was Céleste Dubois’ domain, her stage, her kingdom of whispered requests and flawlessly executed miracles.  Céleste, whose full name was Céleste Marie-Thérèse Dubois, possessed an almost preternatural ability to anticipate the needs of the hotel’s discerning clientele, whether it be securing front-row seats to a sold-out opera, locating a specific vintage of Bordeaux, or arranging a last-minute hot air balloon ride over the Loire Valley. Tonight, however, a different kind of request awaited her, one that shimmered with an unsettling air of mystery.
