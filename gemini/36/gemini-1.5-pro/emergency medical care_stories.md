The wail of the siren sliced through the pre-dawn gloom, a high-pitched lament echoing off the rain-slicked brownstones of Brooklyn. Inside the speeding ambulance, Amelia “Amy” Rodriguez, EMT-Paramedic, braced herself against the lurch as the vehicle swerved to avoid a double-parked delivery truck.  The flashing lights painted the interior a strobe-light blue and white, reflecting off the worry etched on Amy’s face.  Dispatch had been terse: unconscious male, possible overdose, location: Prospect Park, near the Grand Army Plaza entrance.  The park at this hour was a haven for the city’s hidden population, a place where shadows clung to the edges of the lamplight and secrets whispered on the wind. A thin drizzle coated everything in a greasy sheen, making the cobblestone paths treacherous, and the air hung heavy with the scent of wet earth and something else… something acrid and unsettling.  Amy tightened her grip on her medical bag, the familiar weight a small comfort in the face of the unknown. This was her city, her beat, her responsibility. And the rising sun, just beginning to paint the eastern sky a bruised purple, offered no comfort. This call felt different.
