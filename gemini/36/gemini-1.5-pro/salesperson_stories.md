The relentless Florida sun beat down on Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s sensible beige sedan as she navigated the labyrinthine streets of Boca Raton. Palm trees swayed languidly in the stifling humidity, offering little respite from the oppressive heat.  Amelia, a pharmaceutical sales representative for DermaGen Labs, dabbed at the beads of perspiration forming on her upper lip with a delicately embroidered handkerchief.

The air conditioning in her car, struggling valiantly against the Florida heat, wheezed a pathetic sigh, mirroring Amelia’s own internal anxieties.  Dr. Vargas’ office, a gleaming white monolith of modern architecture, loomed before her, an intimidating fortress guarding the secrets of eternal youth.  Amelia took a deep breath, straightened her crisp linen suit, and grabbed her sample case. This was it.  This sale could make or break her quarter.
