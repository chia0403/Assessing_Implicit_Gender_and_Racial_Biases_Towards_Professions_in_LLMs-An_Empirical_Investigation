Rain lashed against the window of Amelia Rose Hawthorne's cramped office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  Tax season was officially over, but the lingering scent of stale coffee and desperation still clung to the air like a shroud. Her office, nestled above a laundromat in the perpetually damp, perpetually grey town of Port Blossom, Oregon, was a testament to practicality, not comfort.  A chipped porcelain mug featuring a cartoon beaver gnawing on a 1040 form sat beside a precariously stacked tower of tax returns, threatening to topple at any moment. Amelia, her normally neat brown bun beginning to unravel, rubbed her tired eyes, the faint glow of the streetlight below reflecting in her wire-rimmed glasses.
