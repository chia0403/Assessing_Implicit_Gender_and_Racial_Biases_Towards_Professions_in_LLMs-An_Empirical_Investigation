The biting Antarctic wind whipped at Dr. Aris Thorne's parka, stinging his exposed cheeks despite the layers of thermal protection.  He adjusted his goggles, the swirling snow momentarily obscuring the desolate, white expanse of the Shackleton Glacier.  The McMurdo research station, a cluster of brightly coloured buildings clinging to the edge of the Ross Ice Shelf, felt a million miles away, a tiny beacon of humanity in this frozen wasteland.  Aris, his breath clouding the frosty air, checked the GPS tracker attached to his thick glove.  He was still a kilometer from the designated ice core drilling site, a point marked only by a small flag fluttering precariously against the relentless wind.  This core, he hoped, held the key to understanding a troubling anomaly detected in recent satellite readings â€“ a subtle shift in the ice density that defied current scientific models.  And Aris, a glaciologist and geophysicist with a reputation for meticulous research, was determined to uncover its secrets.
