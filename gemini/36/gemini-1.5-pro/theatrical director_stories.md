The biting November wind whipped around Esmeralda "Esme" Reyes, swirling fallen leaves into miniature tornadoes around her ankles.  She tugged her threadbare scarlet scarf tighter, a defiant splash of colour against the grey London backdrop.  St. Jude's Church, looming before her, was a gothic behemoth, its stonework blackened with centuries of soot and secrets.  Gargoyles, frozen in eternal grimaces, peered down at her, their expressions mirroring the knot of apprehension tightening in Esme's stomach.  This wasn't just any church; it was the venue for her most ambitious – and possibly disastrous – production yet: a site-specific reimagining of Marlowe's *Doctor Faustus*, set to premiere in less than two weeks. The air within the crumbling archway was thick with the scent of damp stone and something older, something faintly unsettling, like the breath of history itself.  Esme stepped inside, the echo of her boots on the flagstones swallowed by the immense silence.  This wasn't going to be easy. Not at all.
