The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorne, architect extraordinaire, tugging at the edges of his charcoal grey overcoat. He stood on the precipice of a newly excavated foundation, the raw earth smelling of damp clay and the promise of something new.  Around him, the skeletal frames of cranes scratched at the bruised London sky, their silhouettes stark against the swirling clouds.  Below, the bustling heart of Canary Wharf thrummed with a frenetic energy that seemed almost discordant with the quiet intensity of the construction site. Elias, his breath clouding in the frigid air, surveyed the scene with a critical eye, a half-smoked cigarette dangling precariously from his lips. This was his canvas, a rectangle of dirt and potential nestled amidst the steel and glass giants of London's financial district.  Here, he would build his masterpiece, a symphony of glass and light that would pierce the very heavens â€“ or at least, that's what the developers kept telling him.
