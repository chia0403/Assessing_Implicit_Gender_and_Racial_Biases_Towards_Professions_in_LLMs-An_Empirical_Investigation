The midday sun beat down on the Piazza del Campo, turning the terracotta bricks a shimmering orange. Tourists huddled in the shade of the Torre del Mangia, fanning themselves and sipping overpriced bottled water.  Isabella "Izzy" Rossi, her auburn hair pulled back in a practical braid, surveyed the scene with a practiced eye. Her bright yellow "Siena Secrets" tour guide flag, normally held aloft with cheerful enthusiasm, drooped slightly in the oppressive heat.  It was the height of tourist season in Siena, and while Izzy loved sharing the history and beauty of her Tuscan hometown, even she was starting to wilt under the relentless July sun.  This particular tour group, a motley assortment of Americans, Australians, and a lone, perpetually frowning German, seemed more interested in Instagrammable moments than the intricate carvings on the Palazzo Pubblico. Izzy sighed inwardly. This was going to be a long afternoon.
