The siren's wail was a lullaby to Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez. It was 2:17 am, the rain was lashing against the windshield of the ambulance, and the neon glow of the 24-hour laundromat smeared across the wet asphalt. Providence, Rhode Island, was typically quiet at this hour, the historic colonial architecture shrouded in mist and shadow. But tonight, the city held its breath, bracing for the storm both meteorological and metaphorical. Amy, a seasoned paramedic with ten years under her belt at Providence Rescue Squad 3, gripped the steering wheel, her knuckles white against the worn leather. Dispatch had been cryptic, a single breathless report: "Multiple casualties, possible explosion, Dexter Street Market." The air in the cab was thick with anticipation, broken only by the crackle of the radio and the rhythmic thump of the windshield wipers fighting against the deluge.  Dexter Street Market.  A labyrinth of narrow alleyways and tightly packed stalls selling everything from fresh produce to antique jewelry. A fire there would be a nightmare.
