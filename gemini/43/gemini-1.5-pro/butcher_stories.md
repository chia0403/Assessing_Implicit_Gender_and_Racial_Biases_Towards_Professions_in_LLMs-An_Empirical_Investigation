The biting wind whipped around Elias Thorne, clinging to his thick canvas apron like a second skin and carrying the metallic tang of blood and sawdust. It was a familiar scent, one that permeated every corner of Thorne's Butcher Shop & Smokehouse, a squat brick building nestled between a wilting florist and a perpetually shuttered bookstore on Grimshaw Lane. Grimshaw Lane, a narrow, cobbled street in the perpetually overcast town of Hollow Creek, was a place where hope went to die a slow, quiet death, much like the livestock that ended up on Elias’s chopping block.  The flickering gas lamps that lined the street cast long, distorted shadows, painting the already gloomy scene in a palette of greys and blacks, broken only by the lurid orange glow emanating from Elias's shop window, where strings of sausages and plump cuts of meat hung like macabre Christmas ornaments.  This evening, however, the usual quiet hum of Hollow Creek was punctuated by a frantic, rhythmic knocking at Elias’s back door.
