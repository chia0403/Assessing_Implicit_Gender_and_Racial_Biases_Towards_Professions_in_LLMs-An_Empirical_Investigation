The salt spray kissed Elara Thistlewick's face as she perched precariously on the jagged cliffs overlooking Port Blossom. Her easel, battered and paint-splattered, stood defiant against the relentless wind, its legs wedged between two rocks.  Below, the tiny Cornish fishing village huddled against the slate-grey sea, its brightly painted cottages a vibrant splash against the brooding landscape.  The air, thick with the smell of brine and seaweed, whipped Elara's auburn braids across her face as she squinted at the churning water, trying to capture the precise shade of jade swirling around the base of the cliffs.  This particular green, she was convinced, held the key to unlocking the emotional depth of her current project - a series of oil paintings depicting the ever-shifting moods of the Atlantic.  Port Blossom, nestled in its secluded cove, had become both her muse and her sanctuary, a place where the crashing waves echoed the tempestuous currents within her own creative soul.
