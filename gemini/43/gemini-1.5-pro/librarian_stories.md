This evening, however, a different kind of silence hung heavy, a stillness that prickled the back of Eleanor's neck and hinted at something amiss. The usual Tuesday evening crowd of chess players and book club members were noticeably absent, replaced by an unnerving emptiness that echoed through the cavernous reading room.
