Rain lashed against the mullioned windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's office, mimicking the turmoil brewing inside his latest patient.  The room, nestled on the third floor of a converted Victorian house in the heart of Ashworth, Massachusetts, usually projected a sense of calm with its muted earth tones, strategically placed plants, and the faint scent of sandalwood.  But tonight, the storm raging outside seemed to seep into the very fabric of the space, mirroring the anxiety radiating from the woman perched rigidly on the edge of the plush armchair. Elias, a tall, slender man with a neatly trimmed salt-and-pepper beard and eyes that held the weight of a thousand listened stories, leaned forward, his hands clasped gently in front of him. Ashworth, a quaint, historic town nestled amidst the rolling hills of the Berkshires, usually provided a tranquil backdrop to his practice. Tonight, however, even Ashworth seemed to hold its breath, waiting for the storm, both literal and metaphorical, to pass.
