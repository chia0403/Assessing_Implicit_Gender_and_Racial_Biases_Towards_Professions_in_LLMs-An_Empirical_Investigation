The flickering neon sign of the "Binary Bean" cast a lurid, electric green glow across the rain-slicked streets of Neo-Kyoto. Inside, the air hung thick with the aroma of burnt coffee and the hum of overworked servers. Rain lashed against the panoramic window overlooking the city, a million shimmering lights reflecting in the dark glass.  A lone figure, hunched over a laptop perched precariously on a stack of vintage programming manuals, typed furiously, her fingers dancing across the keyboard with a practiced grace.  This was Anya Sharma, a freelance programmer known in certain circles as the "Ghost in the Machine" for her ability to disappear into code and emerge with solutions no one else could fathom.  Tonight, however, the code wasn't cooperating.  A particularly nasty bug in a virtual reality security system was proving more resilient than she'd anticipated, and the deadline loomed like a digital guillotine.  Outside, the neon sign flickered again, momentarily plunging the cafe into darkness, a portent of the storm brewing both inside Anya's code and within the city itself.
