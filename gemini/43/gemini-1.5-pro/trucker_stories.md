The diesel engine grumbled a low, guttural complaint as Delilah "Dee" Jones wrestled the eighteen-wheeler around a particularly nasty bend in the frost-heaved asphalt of Highway 16.  The Wyoming wind howled like a banshee outside her cab, whipping snow across the road in blinding swirls. Visibility was down to about twenty feet, and the only sound louder than the wind and the engine was the rhythmic thump of the chained-up tires on the frozen road.  The digital clock on the dash flashed 3:17 AM, a cruel reminder that dawn was still hours away.  Dee, bundled in a thick fleece jacket and a worn baseball cap pulled low over her ears, squinted through the swirling snow, her knuckles white against the worn leather of the steering wheel. The radio crackled with static punctuated by snippets of a country song about lost love and cheatin' hearts, a soundtrack perfectly suited to the desolate beauty of the high plains.  She was hauling a load of frozen beef from Cheyenne to Billings, a run she'd made countless times, but tonight, the weather had turned even this familiar route into a treacherous gauntlet. The small town of Ten Sleep, her planned fuel stop, was still fifty miles away, and Dee was starting to wonder if she'd even make it that far.
