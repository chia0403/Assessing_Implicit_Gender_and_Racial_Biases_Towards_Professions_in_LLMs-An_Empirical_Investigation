The sugary scent of almond paste and buttercream hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the pre-dawn chill.  Amelia Rose Hawthorne, her fingers dusted with powdered sugar like a baker’s fairy, peered critically at the six-tiered masterpiece taking shape before her.  Outside, the sky above the sleepy town of Havenwood, Oregon, began to blush with the promise of sunrise.  Inside "Buttercup Bake Shop," nestled between a dusty antique store and Mrs. Higgins’ perpetually crowded yarn shop, Amelia was bringing her vision to life: a cascading confection of white chocolate sails and spun-sugar waves, a cake designed to look like a majestic clipper ship sailing a sea of edible turquoise frosting.  This wasn't just any cake; it was for the Havenwood Centennial Celebration, and Amelia, Havenwood’s most sought-after cake decorator, had poured her heart and soul into every sculpted detail.
