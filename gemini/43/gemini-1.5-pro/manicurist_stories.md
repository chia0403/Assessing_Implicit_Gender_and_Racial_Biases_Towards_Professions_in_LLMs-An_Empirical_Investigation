The bell above the door of "Nailed It," a tiny salon squeezed between a laundromat and a perpetually-closed bakery, chimed merrily, announcing the arrival of Mrs. Higgins, a woman whose perfectly coiffed silver hair never moved, even on the windiest of days. Eleanor Grace Hawthorne, Nailed It's sole proprietor and manicurist extraordinaire, plastered on her best welcoming smile.  It was a Tuesday in late November, the kind of grey, damp day in Portland, Oregon, that clung to you like wet wool, seeping into your bones and stealing the sunshine from your soul.  Rain lashed against the large front window, blurring the view of the street beyond into an impressionistic painting of watery greys and muted reds from the taillights of passing cars.  Inside, the salon was a riot of colour, a deliberate defiance of the dreariness outside.  Bottles of nail polish in every shade imaginable lined the walls, creating a vibrant rainbow against the pale pink walls.  The air hummed with the low thrum of the nail dryer and the faint, sweet scent of acetone. Eleanor gestured Mrs. Higgins towards her usual plush, velvet chair, a silent promise of pampering and a temporary escape from the Portland gloom.
