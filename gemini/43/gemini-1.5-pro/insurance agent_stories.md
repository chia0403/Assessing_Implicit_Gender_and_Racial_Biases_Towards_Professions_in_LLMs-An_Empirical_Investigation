Rain lashed against the Art Deco windows of the Continental Life Insurance building, mirroring the storm brewing inside Beatrice "Bea" Agatha Cartwright.  The Chicago wind, usually a blustery baritone, had risen to a screaming soprano, rattling the leaded glass and making the gargoyles perched on the building's corners seem to shudder. Inside, the mahogany-paneled office, usually a haven of hushed tones and the rustling of paperwork, crackled with an unusual tension.  Bea, perched on the edge of her worn leather chair, stared at the blinking cursor on her computer screen, the glow reflecting in the twin pools of worry in her hazel eyes.  A half-eaten tuna salad sandwich sat forlornly on a paper plate beside a stack of files marked "Unsolved." The year was 1938, and business at Continental Life, like the rest of the country, was struggling. But Bea's problems went far beyond the Great Depression.
