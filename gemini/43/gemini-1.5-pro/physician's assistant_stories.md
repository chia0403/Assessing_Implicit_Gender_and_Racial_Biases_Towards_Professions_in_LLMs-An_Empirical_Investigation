Rain lashed against the windows of the small clinic, blurring the already fading light of the late November afternoon. Inside, Amelia Reyes, PA-C, adjusted the stiff collar of her white coat and sighed, the sound swallowed by the relentless drumming on the glass. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the waiting room's worn furniture.  St. Jude's Community Clinic in the sleepy, coastal town of Port Blossom, Oregon, wasn't much to look at, but it was the only medical facility for miles, serving a mix of fishermen, retirees, and the families who clung to the dwindling timber industry. The air held the faint, antiseptic scent of disinfectant mingled with the earthy aroma of the damp coastal forest pressing in on all sides.  Amelia, only six months out of PA school, was the sole provider on duty tonight, bracing herself for whatever the stormy evening might bring.
