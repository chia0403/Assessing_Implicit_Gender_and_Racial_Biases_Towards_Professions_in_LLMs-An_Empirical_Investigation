Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Elias Thorne's office, blurring the already fading twilight view of the Hong Kong skyline.  Forty-two stories below, the neon-drenched streets of Kowloon shimmered and pulsed, reflecting in the sleek, black surface of his desk. Elias, his dark hair streaked with silver at the temples, tapped a stylus against a holographic blueprint of the Helios Tower, a gravity-defying structure destined to be the tallest building in Asia.  He frowned, a crease deepening between his thick, expressive eyebrows. Something about the wind load calculations felt…off. The air in the minimalist office, usually humming with the quiet efficiency of advanced technology, felt thick with a premonition he couldn't quite place.  He glanced at the clock: 19:47.  He’d promised his daughter, Anya, he’d be home for dinner.  But the Helios Tower, his magnum opus, wouldn’t let him go just yet.
