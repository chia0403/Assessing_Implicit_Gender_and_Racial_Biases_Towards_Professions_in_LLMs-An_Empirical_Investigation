The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, rattling the corrugated iron roof of the shed Elara Jane Thistlewick called her workshop.  It was perched precariously on the cliff edge of the tiny Orkney island of Swona, clinging to the windswept landscape like a limpet to a rock.  Inside, amidst a chaotic jumble of vacuum tubes, resistors, and coils of wire, Elara hunched over a battered 1930s Marconi receiver, the faint glow of its dial illuminating the intense concentration on her face. The headphones clamped over her ears muffled the incessant screech of gulls and the rhythmic crash of waves against the rocky shore, replacing them with the static hiss and faint crackle of transatlantic radio waves.  Swona, in the late autumn of 1953, was a remote and unforgiving place, but for Elara, it was home, and her radio, her lifeline to the world beyond.
