The biting November wind whipped around Esmeralda "Esme" Reyes as she stood on the fire escape of the dilapidated Rialto Theatre, a cigarette clenched between her teeth.  Ash drifted down onto the threadbare velvet coat she’d inherited from her grandmother. Below, in the cavernous, dust-choked auditorium, the ghost light cast a lonely circle on the stage, its pale glow illuminating peeling paint and tattered backdrops that whispered stories of past glories. The Rialto, nestled in the heart of the forgotten mill town of Alder’s Bend, Pennsylvania, was once a jewel, a beacon of art and culture. Now, with its leaky roof and perpetually flickering marquee, it was more of a mausoleum, a monument to Esme’s dwindling dreams.  Tonight, however, she felt a flicker of the old fire, a spark of hope ignited by the dog-eared script clutched in her gloved hand.  "The Tempest," it proclaimed in bold, faded letters.  This wasn’t just another high school production of *Our Town*. This was Shakespeare. This was her chance.
