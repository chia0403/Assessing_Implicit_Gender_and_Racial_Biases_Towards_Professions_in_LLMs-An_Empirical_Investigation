The crisp October air, scented with woodsmoke and decaying leaves, nipped at Dr. Elias Thorne's cheeks as he locked the door to Thorne Chiropractic.  The setting sun cast long shadows across Main Street in Harmony Creek, Oregon, painting the Victorian storefronts in hues of orange and purple. Harmony Creek wasn't exactly bustling, even at the best of times, but tonight, a strange stillness hung in the air, a silence broken only by the rustling of leaves in the ancient oak across the street. Elias paused, his hand on the worn brass doorknob, a prickle of unease dancing on his skin.  He'd lived in Harmony Creek his whole life, and he knew every creak, every groan of the old buildings, every whispered secret carried on the wind.  Tonight, something feltâ€¦different.
