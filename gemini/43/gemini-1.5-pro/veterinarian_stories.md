The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne, snatching at the edges of his worn tweed coat as he trudged across the frozen mud of the farmyard.  The sky above the Welsh valley was the colour of a bruised plum, promising snow before nightfall.  Lanterns flickered weakly in the barn windows of Ty Gwyn Farm, casting long, dancing shadows that stretched and distorted across the cobbled yard.  Elias pulled his scarf tighter around his neck, the scent of lanolin and woodsmoke clinging to the wool. He wasn’t looking forward to this call – a difficult calving in the middle of a blizzard was nobody’s idea of a good time, least of all the cow’s.  Ty Gwyn was remote, perched high on the slopes of Cader Idris, and even in good weather the journey was arduous. Tonight, with ice already glazing the narrow, winding roads, it promised to be treacherous.  He hoped Gwenllian, the farmer's wife, had made a strong pot of tea.
