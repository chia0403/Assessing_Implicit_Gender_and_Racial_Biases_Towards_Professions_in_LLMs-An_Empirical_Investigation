The bell above the door of "Petal & Plume" tinkled a melancholic two-note chime as the last customer of the day departed, leaving Eleanor Ainsworth alone amongst the fragrant chaos of her flower shop.  Outside, the late November rain lashed against the large bay window, blurring the already fading light of the Edinburgh afternoon. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of damp earth, lilies, and the slightly acrid tang of chrysanthemums.  Petal & Plume occupied a narrow, two-story building nestled between a bustling whisky shop and a perpetually quiet antiquarian bookstore on a cobbled lane just off the Royal Mile.  The walls, painted a deep, calming teal, were lined with shelves overflowing with terracotta pots, vintage watering cans, and gardening books with cracked spines.  Eleanor, her fingers stained green from re-potting a fussy fern, surveyed her domain with a sigh, a mixture of contentment and weariness settling in her bones.
