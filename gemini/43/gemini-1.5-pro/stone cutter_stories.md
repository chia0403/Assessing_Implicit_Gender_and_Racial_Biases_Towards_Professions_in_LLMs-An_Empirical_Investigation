The biting wind whipped off the Greystone Quarries, stinging Elias Thorne's cheeks and turning his already chapped lips a bruised purple. The sky, a vast canvas of bruised greys and icy blues, threatened snow.  Elias, his thick leather apron dusted with a fine white powder of granite, surveyed the half-finished angel he was carving from a block of Carrara marble, its wings still folded tight against its body. Around him, the quarry echoed with the rhythmic clang of hammer against chisel, the rasp of saws, and the shouts of men wrestling stubborn rock into submission.  The air, heavy with the scent of stone dust and sweat, hung frozen in the pre-dawn chill.  Greystone, nestled high in the windswept Apennine Mountains of Tuscany, was a place of stark beauty and relentless toil, and Elias, at the young age of twenty-four, was already considered its most skilled artisan.  He wasn’t carving just another angel; this one was destined for the Duomo in Florence, a commission that could make his reputation—or break it entirely.
