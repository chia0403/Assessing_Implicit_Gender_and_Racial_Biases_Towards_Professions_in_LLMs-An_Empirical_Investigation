Rain lashed against the window of Amelia Grace Holloway's tiny office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  Tax season was officially over, yet the scent of stale coffee and desperation still clung to the air like a persistent ex-husband. Her office, tucked between a laundromat and a perpetually closed fortune teller's parlor on Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village, was usually a haven of organized chaos.  But today, the overflowing file cabinets, stacks of tax forms, and the single, wilting peace lily on her desk seemed to mock her quiet anxiety.  April 16th should have been a day of liberation, a chance to finally swap out her calculator for a cocktail shaker.  Instead, Amelia found herself staring at a single, unopened envelope, its stark white surface gleaming ominously under the fluorescent lights.  It bore no return address, just her name and a single, cryptic word scrawled across the front in elegant calligraphy: "Restitution."
