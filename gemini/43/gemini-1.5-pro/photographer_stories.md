The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, stinging Amelia “Mia” Karlsson's cheeks and making her regret not wearing a thicker scarf. Grey cliffs, streaked with white guano, loomed over the churning water below, the only sound louder than the wind the raucous cries of the kittiwakes nesting precariously on the ledges.  Mia, her Canon EOS R5 clutched tightly in gloved hands, balanced precariously on a windswept outcropping of rock near the edge of the cliffs at Bempton, a small village on the rugged Yorkshire coast of England.  She’d been braving the elements for hours, hoping to capture the perfect shot of a gannet diving for fish, the spray of the waves a dramatic backdrop to its plummeting form. The salt spray coated her lens, blurring the world into a hazy dreamscape, but she patiently wiped it away, her focus unwavering, the thrill of the hunt coursing through her veins. This desolate, beautiful landscape was her canvas, and the wild creatures its subjects. This was where Mia truly felt alive.
