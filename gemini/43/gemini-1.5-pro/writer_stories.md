Dust motes danced in the weak light filtering through the grimy glass, illuminating a cramped space cluttered with stacks of manuscripts, overflowing bookshelves, and half-empty coffee cups.  The air was thick with the smell of old paper, ink, and the faint, sweet scent of decay emanating from a forgotten bowl of fruit on a rickety table. Elias, his brow furrowed in concentration beneath a shock of unruly dark hair, sat hunched over the machine in a threadbare armchair, the only sound besides the rain and the clacking keys being the occasional frustrated sigh that escaped his lips. He was holed up in the attic room of his dilapidated Victorian house on the outskirts of Hollow Creek, a small, forgotten town nestled deep in the misty valleys of the Appalachian Mountains.  Autumn had arrived, painting the world outside in hues of burnt orange and crimson, a vibrant contrast to the monochrome world Elias inhabited within these four walls.  He had a deadline looming, a gnawing emptiness in his stomach, and a story that refused to be written.
