The biting November wind whipped around Amelia "Amy" Reyes, stinging her cheeks and tugging at the edges of her thick canvas jacket.  Her breath puffed out in white clouds as she surveyed the dilapidated Victorian perched precariously on the cliff edge overlooking the churning, grey expanse of the North Sea. Salt spray kissed the peeling paint of the house, a testament to its long, lonely vigil against the elements.  The sign above the wrought iron gate, barely clinging to its rusted hinges, read "Sea Whisper Manor."  Amy, her toolbox heavy in one hand, adjusted the strap of her headlamp with the other.  This was it.  Her latest job: rewiring a crumbling relic that looked more suited to housing ghosts than humans.  And judging by the unsettling quiet that enveloped the place, she suspected the former might be more likely. The town of Port Blossom, nestled a mile down the winding coastal road, was known for its quaint charm and thriving fishing industry. Sea Whisper Manor, however, sat isolated, a brooding outlier in an otherwise cheerful landscape. Amy had a feeling this job was going to be more than just flipping switches.
