The rusty bell above the door of "Shear Perfection" jingled discordantly as Mrs. Henderson, a woman whose perm defied gravity, bustled out into the drizzling Portland afternoon. Elias Thorne, the shop's owner and sole stylist, sighed and wiped down his station with a lavender-scented towel.  Rain lashed against the large window overlooking Mississippi Avenue, blurring the neon signs of the vintage shops and bookstores that lined the street. The rhythmic drumming of the rain against the glass, usually a comforting sound, felt oppressive today, mirroring the dull ache behind Eliasâ€™s eyes.  November in Portland was always like this: grey, damp, and stubbornly clinging to the last vestiges of autumn, refusing to fully embrace the coming winter.  The air inside the small salon was thick with the lingering scent of hairspray and the faint aroma of the Earl Grey tea Elias constantly brewed. The only other sound, besides the rain, was the quiet hum of the fish tank bubbling in the corner, its neon gravel glowing like a tiny underwater cityscape.  Elias glanced at the appointment book, its pages mostly blank.  Another slow day. He hoped business would pick up before the holidays, otherwise, he might have to resort to cutting the hair of the Siamese fighting fish again, and Napoleon was notoriously difficult to work with.
