The rusty tang of brake dust hung heavy in the air, mingling with the scent of stale coffee and the faint sweetness of honeysuckle that stubbornly climbed the chain-link fence surrounding Beatrice “Bea” Rodriguez’s auto shop.  Bea’s Garage, a squat, cinderblock building painted a defiant shade of turquoise, sat nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed pawn shop on the outskirts of Harmony Creek, Arizona. The desert sun, a malevolent eye in the pale sky, beat down on the cracked asphalt, baking the scattered tools and discarded tires. Inside, the whir of a cooling engine fought a losing battle against the tinny strains of Tejano music spilling from a battered radio perched precariously on a stack of oil filters. Bea, her hands smudged with grease and her dark hair pulled back in a messy bun, wiped a bead of sweat from her brow with the back of her equally grimy hand.  This morning, Harmony Creek seemed as sleepy and predictable as ever, but Bea had a feeling that was about to change.
