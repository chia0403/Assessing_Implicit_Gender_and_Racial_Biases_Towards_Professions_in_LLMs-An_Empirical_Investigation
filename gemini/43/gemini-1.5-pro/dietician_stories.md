Rain lashed against the windows of Eleanor Vance's tiny office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  Her "office," more accurately, was a repurposed broom closet in the back of "Fit Fuel," a gym that smelled perpetually of stale sweat and cheap protein powder. Eleanor, a Registered Dietician with a Masters in Nutritional Science, had envisioned herself counselling patients in a sun-drenched space, inspiring healthy habits and transforming lives.  Instead, she found herself trapped in this damp, dimly lit cubbyhole, primarily tasked with selling overpriced, questionably effective supplements to gym bros obsessed with bicep circumference.  The flickering fluorescent light above buzzed ominously, the only sound competing with the downpour and the rhythmic thump of a bass-heavy workout playlist emanating from the main gym area.  Ashwood, Oregon, population barely exceeding 5,000, wasnâ€™t exactly a metropolis teeming with health-conscious clientele. And on this particularly dreary Tuesday, even the usually chirpy Eleanor felt her optimism beginning to crumble like a day-old rice cake.
