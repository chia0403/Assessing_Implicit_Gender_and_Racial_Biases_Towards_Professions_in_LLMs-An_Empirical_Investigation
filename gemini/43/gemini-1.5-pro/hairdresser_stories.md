The rhythmic snip of scissors punctuated the humid air, each cut a tiny percussion against the backdrop of eighties power ballads blasting from a boombox perched precariously on a stack of old Vogue magazines.  The Salon de Coiffure Magnifique, sandwiched between a laundromat and a perpetually closed fortune teller's in the heart of downtown Marseille, wasn't magnificent by any stretch of the imagination.  Unless, of course, you considered chipped turquoise Formica and a collection of slightly askew framed prints of poodle haircuts magnificent.  For Antoinette Dubois, however, it was her empire.  This Tuesday morning, with the Mediterranean sun already beating down on the dusty street outside, Antoinette, her fiery red hair piled high in a gravity-defying bouffant, surveyed her domain with a critical eye.  A new shipment of hairspray was due any minute, and Madame Dubois was determined to conquer the humidity and the unruly tresses of Marseille one perfectly coiffed client at a time.
