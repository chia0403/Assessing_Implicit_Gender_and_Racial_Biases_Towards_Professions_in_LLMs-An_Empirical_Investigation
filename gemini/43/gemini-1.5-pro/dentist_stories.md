The crisp November air, tinged with the scent of woodsmoke and decaying leaves, whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne as he locked the back door of his practice.  His breath plumed out in ghostly puffs, momentarily obscuring the chipped paint of "Thorne Family Dentistry" hand-lettered on the brick above.  Oakhaven, nestled deep in the Appalachian Mountains of Virginia, was a town where time seemed to move slower, marked by the changing seasons and the steady rhythm of life in the valley. Elias, a third-generation dentist in this tight-knit community, had always appreciated that rhythm. Until tonight.  The unsettling silence, broken only by the rustling of leaves in the ancient oak trees lining Main Street, felt less like peace and more like a held breath, a pregnant pause before something inevitable and unpleasant. The streetlights, usually casting a warm glow on the storefronts, flickered erratically, throwing long, distorted shadows that danced across the empty sidewalks. And in those shadows, Elias could have sworn he saw something move. Something not quite human.
