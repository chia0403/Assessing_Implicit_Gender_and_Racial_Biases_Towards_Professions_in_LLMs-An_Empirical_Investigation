Rain lashed against the arched windows of Genevieve "Vivi" Beaumont's atelier, mimicking the frantic rhythm of her own heartbeat.  Her workspace, nestled above a bustling Parisian flower market in the Marais district, usually buzzed with the soothing scent of drying lavender and the gentle murmur of Vivi’s assistants discussing fabric swatches. Today, however, the air crackled with a nervous energy.  Scattered across the polished oak floor were rolls of silk the colour of bruised plums, velvet cushions embroidered with silver ferns, and sketches of ornate, almost gothic, furniture.  Vivi, a whirlwind in a paint-splattered linen jumpsuit and scarlet lipstick, paced before a mood board dominated by a photograph of a crumbling, yet undeniably magnificent, château in the Loire Valley.  This wasn't just any commission; this was Château de Lune Noire, and its enigmatic new owner, a reclusive American novelist named Mr. Silas Thorne, had a reputation as demanding as he was wealthy.  Vivi’s career, her reputation, perhaps even her sanity, rested on transforming his shadowed fortress into a haven of beauty.
