The biting November wind whipped around Coach Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez as she stood on the sidelines, her breath clouding the air.  The cracked asphalt of the McKinley High School parking lot was slick with a mixture of rain and fallen leaves, reflecting the weak glow of the stadium lights.  Around her, the dejected faces of the McKinley Wildcats mirrored the dreary scene.  0-8.  Another Friday night, another loss. This one, a particularly brutal shutout against their cross-town rivals, the Roosevelt Roughriders. The rhythmic thud of cleats on the asphalt, the rustling of discarded Gatorade cups, and the muffled sobs of a few heartbroken seniors provided the soundtrack to Amyâ€™s despair. This season, which had begun with so much hope, had quickly devolved into a relentless parade of disappointment.  And Amy, in her first year as head coach, felt the weight of each and every defeat pressing down on her.  Tonight, though, something felt different.  A colder, sharper kind of disappointment.  Tonight, Amy felt like she was failing not just her team, but herself.
