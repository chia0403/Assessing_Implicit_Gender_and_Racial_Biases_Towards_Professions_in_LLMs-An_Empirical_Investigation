The biting Alaskan wind whipped at Amelia "Ace" Reyes's flight suit as she wrestled the cargo door of her De Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otter shut.  Ice crystals, sharp as needles, stung her exposed cheeks. The setting sun painted the Chugach Mountains in hues of bruised purple and blood orange, a breathtaking panorama she'd witnessed a thousand times, yet never failed to appreciate.  Beneath the majestic peaks, the Knik Glacier snaked its way through the valley, a frozen river reflecting the fading light.  Talkeetna, her base of operations, nestled at the confluence of the Susitna, Chulitna, and Talkeetna Rivers, looked like a scattering of toy houses from this altitude.  Tonight, however, Ace wasn't admiring the view.  Tonight, she was hauling a cargo she didn't recognize, to a location she hadn't been given, for a client who had insisted on remaining anonymous.  And that, more than the subzero temperatures, sent a shiver down her spine.
