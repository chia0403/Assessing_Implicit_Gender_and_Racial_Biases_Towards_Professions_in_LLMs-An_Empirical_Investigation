The biting wind whipped across the desolate expanse of Route 66, stinging Elias Vance's chapped lips.  He pulled his orange safety vest tighter, the fluorescent fabric a stark contrast against the muted browns and greys of the New Mexico desert.  A tumbleweed, the perfect symbol of his current mood, bounced past his steel-toed boots and skittered across the cracked asphalt. Elias sighed, the plume of his breath momentarily visible in the frigid air.  It was barely dawn, the sky a bruised purple, and he was already questioning the life choices that had led him to become a highway worker, miles from anything resembling civilization. Today's task: patching potholes on a stretch of road so lonely, he suspected even the vultures avoided it.  The sun, a reluctant participant in this frigid morning drama, began to peek over the horizon, casting long, skeletal shadows from the sparse Joshua trees that dotted the landscape.  Elias picked up his shovel, the cold metal biting into his gloved hand.  This was his office, his domain, a kingdom of dust, diesel fumes, and the endless drone of the open road.  And today, it felt particularly desolate.
