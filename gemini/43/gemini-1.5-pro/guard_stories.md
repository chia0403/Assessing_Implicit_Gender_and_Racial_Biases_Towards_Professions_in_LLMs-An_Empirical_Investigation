The biting wind whipped across the obsidian-smooth walls of the Citadel of Whispers, stinging Elias Thorne’s exposed cheeks. He tugged his thick, wolf-fur lined cloak tighter around him, the leather creaking in protest.  Below, the city of Verdant sprawled, a chaotic tapestry of cobbled streets and crooked, timber-framed houses clinging to the mountainside. The Citadel, perched precariously on a sheer cliff face, overlooked it all like a watchful hawk. Elias, stationed on the western ramparts, felt the familiar thrum of unease settle in his stomach.  For three generations, the Thorne family had guarded the Citadel, and in all that time, the whispers had never been this loud. They weren’t actual whispers, of course, more like a low, pervasive hum that vibrated in the very stone beneath his feet, a constant reminder of the power contained within the Citadel walls.  Tonight, it felt different, insistent, almost…hungry.  A sliver of moon hung like a chipped coin in the inky sky, casting long, distorted shadows across the battlements. Elias gripped the hilt of his frost-etched longsword, the cold steel a comforting weight against his gloved hand. Something was coming. He could feel it in his bones.
