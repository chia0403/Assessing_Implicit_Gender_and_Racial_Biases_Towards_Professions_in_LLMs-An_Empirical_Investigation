The flickering neon sign of "Wanderlust Voyages" cast a lurid, electric blue glow across Amelia Iris Thorne's face as she hunched over a stack of brochures.  Rain lashed against the windowpane, a relentless Seattle symphony that mirrored the chaos swirling inside her head. Outside, the Pike Place Market was winding down for the night, the fishy tang of the day's catch lingering in the damp air. Inside, the small travel agency, tucked away between a vintage bookstore and a perpetually-closed psychic parlor, felt like the last bastion of warmth and light in a city perpetually shrouded in drizzle. Amelia, with her perpetually-smudged mascara and a messy bun piled atop her head, was the sole occupant.  She was surrounded by posters depicting sun-drenched beaches, snow-capped mountains, and vibrant, bustling cities â€“ destinations she yearned to experience firsthand, but was perpetually tethered to her desk, arranging those experiences for others. Tonight, however, something felt different. The usual hum of anticipation she felt for her clients' journeys was replaced by a gnawing restlessness, a deep-seated longing that threatened to spill over into the meticulously organized piles of travel documents scattered across her desk.
