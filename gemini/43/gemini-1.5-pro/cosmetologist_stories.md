The pungent scent of perm solution hung heavy in the air, a familiar aroma that clung to Elara Vivienne Holloway like a second skin.  Outside, the humid Florida air shimmered above the asphalt, baking the strip mall where "Shear Radiance," Elara's salon, nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed Chinese buffet.  Palm trees swayed listlessly in the heat, their fronds rustling like gossiping tongues.  Inside, the air conditioner wheezed valiantly against the oppressive afternoon, its rhythmic chugging a counterpoint to the tinny pop music emanating from the radio perched precariously on a stack of hairspray cans.  Elara, her fiery red hair pulled back in a neat bun, meticulously applied foils to Mrs. Higgins' grey roots, a practiced smile plastered on her face despite the woman's incessant chatter about her ungrateful daughter-in-law.  It was a Tuesday, typically slow, but today felt different.  A prickle of unease danced on Elara's skin, a sensation as familiar to her as the smell of bleach and hair dye, a feeling that something was about to change.
