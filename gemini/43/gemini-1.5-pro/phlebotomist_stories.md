The fluorescent lights of St. Jude's Hospital hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Eleanor Vance's early morning routine.  It was 5:30 am, the pre-dawn gloom still clinging to the edges of the sprawling medical complex in downtown Pittsburgh. Eleanor, her dark hair neatly tucked beneath a navy scrub cap, methodically arranged her equipment on the stainless steel cart: lavender-topped tubes, butterfly needles, tourniquets, alcohol swabs, and a small container of brightly coloured bandages â€“ a silent promise of a tiny reward for bravery.  The air in the phlebotomy lab was thick with the antiseptic scent of bleach and the faint, metallic tang of blood, a smell Eleanor had long ago ceased to notice. Outside, the first hesitant rays of sunlight were beginning to paint the steel and glass skyscrapers in hues of rose gold, but within these sterile walls, the world was still shrouded in clinical white and hushed expectancy, waiting for the day's influx of patients and the stories their blood would tell.
