Rain lashed against the attic window, mimicking the relentless drumming in Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s head.  Loose panes rattled in their frames, a counterpoint to the insistent ticking of the grandfather clock in the hall below.  Her office, tucked away under the eaves of the rambling Victorian house, usually offered a comforting sanctuary. Tonight, however, the familiar scent of old books and beeswax polish did little to soothe her frayed nerves.  Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, whipping the branches of the ancient oak against the glass.  Scattered across Amelia’s antique writing desk lay the remnants of a manuscript – pages filled with a spidery, almost illegible script, interspersed with cryptic symbols she couldn’t decipher. This wasn't the usual historical romance or cozy mystery she edited; this was something...different. Something unsettling.
