The biting pre-dawn air, sharp with the scent of pine and frost, nipped at Elijah Jedediah Blackwood's exposed cheeks.  He stood at the edge of the Widowmaker’s Stand, a swathe of ancient Douglas firs clinging precariously to the steep slope of Mount Ferox in the Cascade Range.  The rising sun, still hidden behind the jagged peaks, painted the eastern sky in hues of bruised plum and blood orange, casting long, skeletal shadows that danced and stretched across the frosted ground. Elijah, his breath clouding in the frigid air, adjusted the thick wool cap perched on his head and surveyed the towering trees, each a silent testament to centuries of weathering storms and clinging to life. The Widowmaker's Stand had earned its name –  more than a few loggers had met their end on these treacherous slopes, felled not by the bite of the saw, but by the unpredictable whims of gravity and the unforgiving terrain.  Today, it was Elijah’s turn to wrestle with the giants.
