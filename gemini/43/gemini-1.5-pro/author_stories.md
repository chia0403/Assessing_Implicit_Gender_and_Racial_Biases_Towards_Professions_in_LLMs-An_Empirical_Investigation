The salt spray kissed Amelia "Mia" Thorne's face as she leaned against the weathered railing of her seaside cottage.  The cottage, perched precariously on the cliffs of Portwenn, Cornwall, was a haphazard collection of mismatched windows and uneven stone walls, clinging to the edge of the world like a stubborn limpet.
