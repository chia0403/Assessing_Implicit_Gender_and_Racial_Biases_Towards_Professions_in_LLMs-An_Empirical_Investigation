The fluorescent lights of Mrs. Eleanor Vance's kindergarten classroom hummed a monotonous B-flat, a counterpoint to the cacophony of twenty-five five-year-olds engrossed in the vital task of gluing googly eyes onto paper plate pumpkins.  The air hung thick with the scent of Elmer's glue and the faint, lingering aroma of Ms. Vance's cinnamon apple hand sanitizer.  Sunshine, weak and watery from its struggle through the grimy windows of Maplewood Elementary, splashed across the worn linoleum floor in fragmented squares.  Outside, the skeletal branches of a towering oak clawed at the overcast November sky, hinting at the impending winter. Inside, Mrs. Vance, a woman whose patience was as boundless as the energy of a hyperactive hummingbird, surveyed her domain with a weary, but genuine, smile.  This, she thought, this beautiful, chaotic mess, was exactly where she belonged.  Little did she know, the quiet hum of the fluorescent lights was about to be shattered.
