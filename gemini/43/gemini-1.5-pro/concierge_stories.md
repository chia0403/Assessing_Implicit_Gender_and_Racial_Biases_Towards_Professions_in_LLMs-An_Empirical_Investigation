Rain lashed against the arched windows of the Grand Blackwood Hotel, each drop a tiny explosion against the century-old glass.  Inside, the lobby glowed with the warm light of crystal chandeliers, casting flickering shadows on the polished marble floor. The air hummed with a low, comforting murmur of conversation and the clinking of fine china from the Blackwood Grill.  This was Genevieve "Gen" Duboisâ€™ domain.  As the Head Concierge, Gen surveyed her kingdom from behind the imposing mahogany concierge desk, her gaze sweeping over the arriving guests, her mind already cataloging their needs before they even reached the velvet ropes.  The Blackwood, nestled in the heart of Montreal's historic Golden Square Mile, was a haven of old-world elegance and modern luxury, and Gen, with her impeccable French and effortless charm, was its gatekeeper. Tonight, however, a subtle tension hung in the air, a discordant note in the usual symphony of hushed sophistication.  A storm was brewing, both outside and within the hallowed halls of the Grand Blackwood.
