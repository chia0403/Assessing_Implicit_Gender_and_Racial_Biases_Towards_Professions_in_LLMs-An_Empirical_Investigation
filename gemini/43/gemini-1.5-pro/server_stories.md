The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the Busy Bee Diner, a relentless metallic drumming that mirrored the knot in Amelia Rose Holloway's stomach.  It was a Tuesday night in late November, the kind of night that sucked the warmth right out of the small Oregon coastal town of Port Blossom. Inside, the diner hummed with a low, weary energy.  Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the red vinyl booths and checkered linoleum floor.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and frying onions, a comforting aroma on most nights, but tonight, it just made Amelia feel nauseous.  She tugged at the collar of her starched white uniform, the nametag pinned above her left breast glinting under the harsh lights: "Amelia."  Only her grandmother ever called her Amelia Rose.  And Grandma Rose wasn't here anymore. Which was exactly why Amelia's stomach churned, and the rhythmic drumming of the rain felt less like a lullaby and more like a death knell.
