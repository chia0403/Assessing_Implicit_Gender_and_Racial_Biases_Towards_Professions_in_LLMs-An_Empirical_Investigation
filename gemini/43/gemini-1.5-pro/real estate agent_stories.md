The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's auburn hair across her face as she stood on the porch of the dilapidated Victorian, the peeling paint the color of a bruised plum.  The porch swing creaked rhythmically in the wind, a lonely counterpoint to the rustling oak leaves that carpeted the overgrown lawn.  Blackwood Manor, as it was grandly, if ironically, named, perched precariously on a bluff overlooking the churning gray waters of the Puget Sound.  The salt spray hung heavy in the air, a constant reminder of the house's precarious position and the equally precarious state of Amy's commission if she couldn't manage to sell this crumbling relic.  The view, admittedly, was breathtaking – the Olympic Mountains loomed in the distance, dusted with early snow – but Amy doubted even that could overcome the overwhelming scent of mildew and the unsettling sense that she wasn't entirely alone within the echoing halls of the house.
