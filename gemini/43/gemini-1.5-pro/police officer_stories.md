The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, tearing at Detective Isabella "Izzy" Diaz's trench coat and stinging her exposed cheeks.  It was 4:17 am, the sky a bruised purple bleeding into a reluctant dawn over the Chicago skyline.  The flashing red and blue lights of her squad car painted grotesque, fleeting shadows across the boarded-up windows of the abandoned warehouse on West Cermak. Steam curled from the sewer grates like ghostly fingers reaching up from the city's underbelly. The radio crackled with static, then a dispatcher's weary voice: "Unit 42, we have a 10-22 at 2749 West Cermak. Possible 187. Proceed with caution." Izzy took a deep breath, the metallic tang of blood already thick in the air. This wasn't going to be a good one.
