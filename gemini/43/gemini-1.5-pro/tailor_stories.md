The biting wind whipped through the cobbled streets of Aethelburg, tugging at the brightly coloured fabrics hanging outside Elias Finchâ€™s shop.  The sign above, depicting a needle threading itself with impossibly fine golden thread, creaked rhythmically in the gusts.  Inside, nestled amongst bolts of velvet, silk, and roughspun wool, Elias himself hunched over a half-finished doublet, the flickering lamplight illuminating the intricate embroidery he was painstakingly crafting.  Snow dusted the windowpanes, blurring the view of the bustling market square, usually vibrant even in the depths of winter, but now deserted save for a lone, cloaked figure making their way towards the tailor's shop.  The bell above the door jingled, its cheerful chime at odds with the ominous atmosphere that had settled over Aethelburg in recent weeks.
