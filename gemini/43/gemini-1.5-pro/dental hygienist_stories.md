The frigid January air nipped at Amelia Grace Hawthorneâ€™s cheeks as she hurried across the slush-covered parking lot of the Aspen Dental Clinic.  Her breath puffed out in white clouds, momentarily obscuring the pristine, snow-dusted peaks of the San Juan Mountains that loomed over the small Colorado town of Silverton.  The clinic, a squat, brick building nestled between a fly-fishing shop and a bakery perpetually emitting the warm scent of cinnamon rolls, was her sanctuary.  Inside, the fluorescent lights hummed a steady, comforting drone, a stark contrast to the howling wind that rattled the windowpanes. Amelia, clad in her crisp, mint-green scrubs, pushed open the heavy oak door, the tiny bell above it jingling a cheerful welcome.  The waiting room, usually bustling with nervous patients clutching insurance cards, was eerily empty. It was 7:55 am, five minutes before the clinic officially opened, and the only sound was the gentle gurgle of the fish tank in the corner, its neon-gravelled bottom a jarring splash of color against the sterile white walls.
