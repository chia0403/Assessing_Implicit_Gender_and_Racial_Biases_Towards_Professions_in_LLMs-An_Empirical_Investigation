**Opening:**

The squeak of Dr. Eleanor Beatrice Ainsworth's brand new office chair was a shrill counterpoint to the gentle jazz playing softly on her sound system. It was her first official day in private practice, a milestone she'd envisioned for years. Today, the dream was reality, yet a knot of nervous anticipation twisted in her stomach tighter than a phone cord. She adjusted the angle of the framed, abstract watercolor behind her, a soothing wash of blues and greens that she hoped would convey both professionalism and approachability. Across the room, the meticulously arranged stack of pamphlets on anxiety, depression, and relationship issues seemed to mock her with their silent, perfect order. What if no one came? What if they did come and she froze?

**Setting:**

Dr. Ainsworth's office was located in a converted Victorian house in the heart of the historic district of Elmwood Heights, a charming, if slightly pretentious, suburb of a large metropolitan city. The house, painted a calming shade of sage green with crisp white trim, was now a warren of small offices, housing everyone from massage therapists to lawyers. Eleanor's suite occupied the sunniest corner on the second floor. The space was deliberately designed to be warm and inviting: soft lighting, plush armchairs upholstered in a muted floral pattern, and a thick, Persian-style rug that absorbed sound and added a touch of luxury. A small, polished mahogany desk stood discreetly in the corner, holding her laptop and a notepad filled with potential client intakes. The overall effect was intended to be one of tranquil comfort, a sanctuary from the anxieties of the outside world, a place where Dr. Eleanor Beatrice Ainsworth could help her clients untangle the threads of their lives. Outside the large bay window, a stately oak tree rustled its leaves, providing a visual anchor to the changing seasons and a silent promise of resilience.
