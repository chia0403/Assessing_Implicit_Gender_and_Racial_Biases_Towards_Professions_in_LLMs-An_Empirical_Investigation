The metallic tang of old pipes and the faint, earthy smell of damp concrete were Beatrice Eleanor Riley's constants. They permeated her overalls, clung to her hair, and settled into the grooves of her work boots. Beatrice, or Bea as she preferred, had been tracing these particular smells through the labyrinthine basement of the old Blackwood Manor for the past two hours, flashlight beam dancing over cobweb-draped pipes like a frantic firefly. Blackwood Manor, a hulking Gothic monstrosity perched precariously on the bluffs overlooking the churning Atlantic, was a plumber's nightmare and a history buff's wet dream.

Its owner, a reclusive novelist named Alistair Thorne, had called in a panic. A pipe, crucial to the ancient and temperamental boiler that heated the entire drafty structure, had burst. He'd sounded almost apologetic on the phone, his voice a whisper lost in the static, "I know it's late, Miss Riley, but I'm quite desperate. The temperature inside is...unsuitable for human comfort."

Bea didn't mind late calls, not when they paid as well as Mr. Thorneâ€™s usually did. And Blackwood Manor, despite its intimidating facade and the unsettling rumors whispered about it in town, had always held a strange allure for her. Built in the late 1800s by a sea captain rumored to have made his fortune through less-than-savory means, the manor was a relic of a bygone era, filled with forgotten stories and whispered secrets - secrets Bea suspected the pipes themselves held.

Tonight, however, the secrets felt heavier, more oppressive. The silence of the basement, punctuated only by the drip, drip, drip of the remaining leak, felt less like peace and more like a held breath. Bea straightened, wiping a streak of grime across her forehead. The pipes here were ancient, probably original to the house, a tangled mess of corroded iron and lead. She shivered, a sensation that had less to do with the chill in the air and more to do with the prickling unease crawling up her spine. Something felt...off. And Beatrice Eleanor Riley, a plumber who trusted her instincts as much as her wrench, knew that finding the leak was about to be the least of her problems.
