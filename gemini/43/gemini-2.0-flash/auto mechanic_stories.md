The greasy wrench slipped in Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez's hand, smacking against the rusted frame of the '67 Mustang. "Damn it!" she swore, more out of frustration than pain. The fluorescent lights of Rodriguez Auto Repair hummed overhead, buzzing like a trapped wasp, a soundtrack Amy knew as well as her own heartbeat.

Rodriguez Auto Repair wasnâ€™t much to look at, nestled between a dusty laundromat and a boarded-up antique store on the outskirts of Harmony Creek, Kansas. The building itself was a faded blue cinder block, its once-vibrant paint peeling like sunburnt skin. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of motor oil, WD-40, and stale coffee. Calendars featuring classic cars adorned the walls, their pages long flipped past their expiration date. A battered radio, usually tuned to the classic rock station, sat perched precariously on a stack of spare tires in the corner. Harmony Creek, a town that hadn't seen much action since the '50s, was just the kind of place where a woman like Amy, with grease under her fingernails and a heart of pure octane, could quietly keep things running, one sputtering engine at a time.
