The air in Camille Augustine Moreau’s Parisian studio hung thick with the scent of linseed oil, turpentine, and the faint, lingering aroma of stale coffee. Dust motes danced in the shafts of sunlight slicing through the tall, grimy windows of her fourth-floor walk-up overlooking the bustling Place du Tertre. It was early morning, barely past dawn, and the cafe below was already churning out its first coffees and croissants, the sounds a muffled hum that Camille usually found comforting. Today, however, the sounds irritated her.

Her palette, already a chaotic mess of dried pigment and vibrant dabs of fresh color, lay discarded on a nearby table. Empty tubes of cobalt blue and cadmium yellow littered the floor, casualties of her restless pacing. Camille, dressed in paint-splattered overalls and an oversized, paint-stained men’s shirt, ran a hand through her perpetually untidy auburn hair, leaving a smear of ultramarine on her temple. She hadn’t slept well, plagued by the same image that haunted her waking hours: the stark white canvas, mocking her with its emptiness.
