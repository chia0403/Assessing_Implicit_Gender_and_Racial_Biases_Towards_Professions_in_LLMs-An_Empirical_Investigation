The flickering fluorescent light above Bethany Mae Harkness's head hummed a relentless, low-frequency song of tedium. It was 6:47 PM on a Tuesday, and the only other sounds in the small, windowless back office of "Petunia's Plants and Provisions" were the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of her fingers on the keyboard and the occasional sigh escaping her lips. The air hung thick with the combined scents of stale coffee, fertilizer dust that had inexplicably permeated everything, and a faint, lingering sweetness that Bethany suspected was Petunia herself, liberally applying lavender hand lotion.

Petunia's was nestled in the heart of Oakhaven, a quaint, relentlessly cheerful little town that prided itself on its annual "Pumpkin Spice Latte Appreciation Festival" and its unwavering commitment to all things "local and lovely." Bethany, an anomaly in this landscape of quaintness, found herself drawn to the predictability of numbers, the satisfying order of spreadsheets, and the quiet solitude of her bookkeeper's lair, even if it did smell faintly of compost. Outside, the sun was dipping below the horizon, painting the perfectly manicured lawns of Oakhaven in shades of apricot and rose. Inside, Bethany was staring down a discrepancy of $37.52, and feeling the first, familiar stirrings of pre-inventory panic.
