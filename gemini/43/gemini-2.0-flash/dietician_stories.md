The salt spray stung Amelia Rose Thorne’s face as she gripped the railing of the ferry, the rhythmic chug of the engine a familiar lullaby. She inhaled deeply, trying to separate the briny tang from the lingering scent of burnt coffee clinging to her sensible, waterproof jacket. The sun, a watery pearl behind a scrim of grey clouds, offered little warmth.

This was it. Her new life, bobbing gently on the unforgiving Atlantic.

Amelia, a registered dietician and certified intuitive eating counselor, was leaving the stifling predictability of her London practice for the rugged isolation of Oakhaven Island, a speck of land clinging stubbornly to the Cornish coast. The island, population 127 and dwindling, was desperate. They needed a doctor, a teacher, and, apparently, a dedicated professional to tackle their collective… eating habits. Or, more accurately, their lack thereof.

Oakhaven wasn't known for its culinary delights. The local pub served a daily special of battered cod and chips, the general store stocked mostly tinned goods and biscuits, and the island's primary crops consisted of seaweed and stubborn potatoes. Amelia had seen the plea for help online, a desperate, almost comical post from the Oakhaven Parish Council: "Urgent! Island facing scurvy epidemic. Must find professional who knows things about fruits and vegetables!"

Against her better judgment, and fueled by a gnawing restlessness she couldn't ignore, Amelia had answered the call. She pictured herself, a nutritional beacon in a sea of deep-fried despair, transforming the islanders into paragons of health and well-being. Of course, she also secretly hoped to find a little peace, something London, with its relentless demands and suffocating social expectations, had long since failed to provide.

As the ferry rounded a craggy headland, revealing a cluster of whitewashed cottages huddled around a small harbour, Amelia tightened her grip on the railing. Oakhaven Island looked exactly as she had imagined: windswept, beautiful, and utterly, terrifyingly, her new home. The real work, she knew, was just beginning.
