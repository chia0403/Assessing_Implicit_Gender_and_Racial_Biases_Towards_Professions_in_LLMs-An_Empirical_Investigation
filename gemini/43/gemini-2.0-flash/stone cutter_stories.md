The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of crushed granite and damp earth. Dust, finer than the powder on a butterfly's wing, perpetually coated everything in the town of Stonehaven: the window sills of the squat, grey houses, the gnarled fingers of the ancient oak that stood sentinel in the town square, and the lungs of its inhabitants. The perpetual whine of the chisels, the rhythmic thud of hammers, the constant rumble of carts laden with newly quarried stone â€“ these were the sounds of Stonehaven, the sounds that shaped its identity and its livelihood.

At the edge of the town, where the fields met the foothills of the imposing Obsidian Mountains, stood the workshop of Alistair Thorne. A ramshackle affair built of scavenged stone and timbers, it offered little protection from the elements, but it was home to Alistair, his tools, and his life's passion. The floor was a jumbled mosaic of stone scraps, the walls lined with half-finished sculptures and meticulously organized tools. Sunlight, diffused by the ever-present dust, streamed through the gaps in the roof, illuminating the fine, patient work of Alistair Thorne, master stone cutter, as he coaxed beauty from the unforgiving rock.
