The salt spray stung Eleanor Beatrice Ainsworth’s face as she stood at the edge of the crumbling stone seawall. The wind, a belligerent force, ripped at her shawl, threatening to pull it into the frothing Atlantic. She gripped the worn wool tighter, her knuckles white against its faded emerald green.

The setting was Port Blossom, a village clinging precariously to the rugged coastline of County Clare, Ireland. Once a bustling hub for fishing and trade, Port Blossom was now mostly a ghost of its former self. The grand, albeit weather-beaten, Victorian houses that lined the main street stood as silent witnesses to its decline, their paint peeling and gardens overgrown. The cobblestone streets, worn smooth by generations of footsteps, were now cracked and scattered with seaweed carried in on the high tide.

Eleanor had chosen Port Blossom as a haven, a place to escape the suffocating expectations of London literary circles and, more pressingly, the gaping chasm left by the ending of her last (disastrous, critically savaged) novel. She’d rented a tiny cottage on the far edge of town, overlooking the churning sea. "Seagull's Perch" it was ironically named, as Eleanor harbored a deep-seated fear of birds. The cottage was drafty, damp, and smelled perpetually of brine and peat smoke, but it offered a solitude she desperately craved.

The grey, endless sky, the relentless roar of the waves, the scent of the sea – all of it was supposed to be conducive to creativity. Instead, Eleanor Beatrice Ainsworth, acclaimed author of three wildly successful (and now seemingly irrelevant) historical romances, felt utterly and completely barren.
