The clock on the wall, a garish orange monstrosity shaped like a smiling apple, clicked loudly, each tick a hammer blow against Ms. Beatrice Eleanor Hawthorne's temples. It was 3:17 PM on a Friday, the end of a week that had felt approximately the same length as the Jurassic Period. Her third-grade class at Willow Creek Elementary in Harmony, Ohio, was finally, blessedly, packing up. Harmony, Ohio, was the kind of place where the biggest excitement of the year was the annual Pumpkin Festival and everyone knew everyone else’s business, and Beatrice Hawthorne was usually quite content there. But right now, staring at the swirling chaos of backpacks and chattering children, contentment felt galaxies away.

The classroom itself was a kaleidoscope of primary colors and sticky residue. Construction paper rainbows adorned the walls, proclaiming "Welcome to Third Grade!" in glitter glue, and a faint, lingering scent of Elmer’s glue and stale Goldfish crackers permeated the air. Beatrice’s desk, buried beneath a mountain of ungraded spelling tests and permission slips for the upcoming field trip to the local apple orchard, was her only (somewhat) organized refuge. She longed to sink into her worn-out desk chair and close her eyes, but the gleam in little Timmy Henderson’s eye, as he plotted to smear glitter on Penelope Albright’s ponytail, told her her workday wasn't quite over yet. It never truly was, not when you were Beatrice Eleanor Hawthorne, champion of commas and conqueror of unruly shoelaces, and dedicated (though currently exhausted) third-grade teacher.
