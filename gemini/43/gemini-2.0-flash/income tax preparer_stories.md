The fluorescent lights of "Precision Tax Solutions," a single-frontage office nestled between a laundromat and a failing pawn shop on Elm Street, buzzed with the unrelenting hum of late-March anxiety. Outside, a watery sun battled the persistent chill of early spring, casting long, skeletal shadows across the sidewalk. Inside, Edgar Alistair Finch, CPA, battled a different beast: the ever-growing mountain of receipts, forms, and hastily-scribbled notes that threatened to engulf his already cramped desk.

Edgar adjusted his glasses, which perpetually threatened to slide down his nose, and sighed. His tie, patterned with miniature calculators, felt tighter than usual. Another year, another tax season pushing him to the very edge of sanity. He took a long sip of lukewarm coffee from a mug that read, "Keep Calm and Itemize," and steeled himself. Today, Mrs. Periwinkle was coming in with her usual shoebox full of "deductible knitting supplies," followed by young Mr. Henderson, who was convinced he could write off his entire Dungeons & Dragons collection as "research materials."

Edgar just hoped he could make it through the day without accidentally quoting the tax code in his sleep again. He'd done that last week. His landlady hadn't appreciated it.
