## Story Opening & Setting:

**Opening:**

The crackle was back, persistent and malevolent, like a swarm of angry bees buzzing right inside Archibald Finch's skull. He swore under his breath, the words barely audible over the hiss emanating from the pre-war Atwater Kent radio he was currently wrestling with.  He prodded a dusty vacuum tube, the filaments glowing an eerie, orangey-red, and muttered, "Come on, you stubborn piece of junk. Just a little further…"

A particularly vicious burst of static erupted, causing Archibald to jump. He slammed his wrench down on the workbench, the metallic clang echoing in the cramped space.  He ran a hand through his already disheveled, grey-flecked hair, leaving a faint smudge of grease on his forehead. He felt a familiar wave of frustration threatening to engulf him. This radio was a temperamental beast at the best of times, and today… today was definitely *not* the best of times.

**Setting:**

Archibald Finch's workshop was a testament to a lifetime spent tinkering, diagnosing, and coaxing life back into defunct machinery.  The room, barely larger than a walk-in closet, was crammed with salvaged wires, resistors, vacuum tubes in various states of decay, and half-disassembled radios of every make and model imaginable. Tools hung on pegboards covering one wall, their shadows dancing in the flickering light cast by a single, bare bulb hanging precariously from the ceiling.

The air hung thick with the aroma of burnt solder, ozone, and the faint, musty scent of decaying paper from countless manuals and schematics stacked haphazardly on shelves that threatened to buckle under the weight. A window, grimy and cobweb-laden, offered a muted view of the quiet, fog-shrouded streets of Port Blossom, Maine, in the heart of a particularly dreary November.  The pervasive dampness seemed to seep into everything, clinging to the metal surfaces and adding a layer of chill to the already frigid air.  Outside, the mournful cry of a foghorn punctuated the silence, a constant reminder of the vast, unforgiving ocean that embraced the small, isolated town.
