## The Story Opening:

The insistent buzz of the service elevator sliced through the pre-dawn quiet of the Grand Majestic Hotel like a discordant note. Alistair Finch, his eyelids still heavy with sleep, groaned and reluctantly pushed himself upright on the worn, velour couch in the employee break room. He knew that buzz, dreaded that buzz. It was a symphony of impending chaos, usually heralded by a particularly demanding guest with an ungodly amount of luggage and a severe allergy to smiles.

Alistair dragged a hand through his perpetually messy, dark hair, dislodging a few stray crumbs from the cheese and cracker escapade he'd indulged in last night, a paltry rebellion against the monotony of his shift. He glanced at the clock above the coffee maker - 5:17 AM. Just enough time to splash some water on his face and attempt to iron the wrinkles out of his uniform, a uniform he increasingly felt was shrinking with each passing day. He sighed, a sound like air slowly escaping a punctured tire, and muttered, "Another day, another mountain of suitcases."
## The Setting:

The Grand Majestic Hotel, located in the heart of bustling downtown Chicago, was a monument to a bygone era of opulence. Built in the roaring twenties, it boasted soaring ceilings adorned with intricate plasterwork, shimmering crystal chandeliers that cast a warm, golden light, and miles of plush red carpeting that muffled the footsteps of both hurried staff and leisurely guests.

The lobby, a cavernous space filled with the low hum of conversation and the gentle tinkling of the grand piano in the corner, was a carefully orchestrated scene of controlled chaos. Immaculately dressed concierge staff glided between anxious tourists and seasoned business travelers, their voices a calming balm amidst the whirlwind of arrivals and departures. Polished brass luggage carts, laden with designer bags and overflowing suitcases, weaved through the crowds, guided by bellhops like Alistair, the foot soldiers of this five-star battlefield.

Beyond the lobby, a maze of ornate hallways led to hundreds of guest rooms, each a meticulously designed haven of comfort and luxury. From the lavish presidential suite on the top floor, with its panoramic views of the city skyline, to the slightly more modest but equally elegant standard rooms, the Grand Majestic was a sanctuary for the wealthy and discerning, a place where impeccable service was not just expected, but demanded. And at the heart of that service, often overlooked but undeniably essential, was the bellhop, the unsung hero burdened with luggage, tips, and the occasionally unreasonable request.
