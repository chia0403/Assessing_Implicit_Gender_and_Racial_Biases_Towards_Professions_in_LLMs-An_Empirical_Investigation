The fluorescent lights of the Green Meadow Pharmacy hummed, a monotonous drone that Amelia Rose Carter barely registered anymore. They had been humming that same tune for the past twelve years, a low-grade symphony of suburban boredom conducted by the ever-present scent of antiseptic and bubblegum-flavored childrenâ€™s medicine. Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the parking lot of the strip mall, painting the faded facades of the dry cleaner and the nail salon in a golden hue. Inside, however, time felt like it moved in molasses.

Amelia, perched on her stool behind the counter, meticulously counted out a prescription for Mrs. Henderson's blood pressure medication. She knew, without even looking, that Mrs. Henderson would be wearing a floral dress a size too small and would complain, in excruciating detail, about the state of her knee. It was Tuesdays, and Tuesdays were always the same in Green Meadow, Ohio. Amelia often wondered if the entire town operated on a pre-programmed cycle, each day a carbon copy of the last.

Tonight, though, felt different. There was a palpable static in the air, a tension that had nothing to do with the impending thunderstorm predicted by the weather channel. Amelia glanced at the clock: 5:57 PM. Three minutes until closing. Three minutes until she could escape the sterile confines of her pharmacy and retreat to her quiet little bungalow on Maple Street, a place where the only humming was the one she herself did as she brewed a pot of chamomile tea and lost herself in the pages of a good book. But that nagging feeling persisted. Tonight, Amelia Rose Carter sensed, something was about to change.
