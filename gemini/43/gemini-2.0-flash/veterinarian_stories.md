## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The biting January wind whipped across the barren plains of Montana, tugging at the weathered wood of the Prairie Vista Veterinary Clinic. Located just outside the small, practically-forgotten town of Willow Creek, the clinic stood as a beacon of hope, albeit a rather rustic one, for ranchers and animal lovers within a hundred-mile radius. Inside, a potbellied stove struggled valiantly against the encroaching cold, casting a warm, flickering glow on the worn linoleum floor. The scent of antiseptic mingled with the faint, earthy aroma of hay and disinfectant, a familiar and comforting cocktail to the clinic's sole practitioner.

**Opening:** A mournful howl, sharp and punctuated with pain, pierced the frosty air. Dr. Evelyn Maeve Sinclair, her brow furrowed in concern, pushed away from her desk, where she'd been wrestling with overdue invoices and dwindling savings account balances. She exchanged a knowing glance with Beatrice, the aging calico cat perpetually draped across the reception counter, and hurried towards the sound. It was coming from the kennels in the back, where a snow-covered pickup truck idled, its engine rattling a protest against the sub-zero temperature. Another howl ripped through the air, followed by a panicked bark. Evelyn knew, even before she reached the open truck bed, that today wasn't going to be an easy one.
