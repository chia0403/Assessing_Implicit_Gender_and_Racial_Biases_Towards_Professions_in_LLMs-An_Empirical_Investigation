The relentless Alabama sun beat down on Elias James Harding, turning his sweat into a salty sheen that stung his eyes. He squinted, wiping his brow with the back of his calloused hand, the scent of pine tar and motor oil clinging to his skin. Dust, red as the earth itself, coated everything – his work boots, his hard hat, even the half-eaten peanut butter sandwich he’d abandoned on the tailgate of his dented Ford pickup.

Elias was on the outskirts of Fairhope, Alabama, a town that clung to the eastern shore of Mobile Bay like a barnacle to a hull. He wasn’t building houses for the wealthy retirees flocking to the Gulf Coast, though. Instead, he was part of a small crew erecting the steel framework for a new industrial park on what used to be old man Hemlock’s pecan grove. The air still carried a faint, sweet fragrance from the slaughtered trees, a scent that always gave Elias a twinge of regret, even though he knew progress – and paychecks – demanded sacrifice. He looked out towards the shimmering, blue expanse of the bay, a stark contrast to the brown, bulldozed landscape he was helping to create, and took a deep breath, bracing himself for another grueling afternoon.
