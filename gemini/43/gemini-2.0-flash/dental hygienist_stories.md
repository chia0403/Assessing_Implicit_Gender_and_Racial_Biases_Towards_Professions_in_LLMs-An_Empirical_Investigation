The sickly sweet scent of artificial cherry hung thick in the air, a familiar and not entirely unpleasant aroma that clung to everything in Dr. Peterson’s bustling dental practice. For Elara Maeve O’Connell, the smell was the soundtrack to her day, a constant reminder that she was in the business of saving smiles, one scaling and polishing at a time.

Elara was a creature of habit, and Monday mornings were perhaps the most deeply entrenched into her routine. She arrived at the office precisely at 7:45 am, fifteen minutes before her first patient, just enough time to brew a pot of strong, dark coffee and meticulously sterilize her instruments. Today, however, the normally calming ritual felt like a tense countdown. 

The setting was the "Bright Smiles Family Dentistry," a two-story brick building nestled on a tree-lined street in the quaint town of Willow Creek, Connecticut. The waiting room, carefully curated for maximum comfort, boasted overstuffed armchairs upholstered in a cheerful floral print, a fish tank bubbling with placid goldfish, and a stack of well-worn magazines featuring celebrities with blindingly white teeth. Behind the reception desk, the perpetually cheerful receptionist, Brenda, was already fielding calls, her voice a soothing balm to the impending anxiety Elara felt bubbling in her stomach.

Elara wasn't nervous about the actual work, not anymore. After five years in the profession, she could wield a scaler with the precision of a surgeon and coax a child into opening wide with the patience of a saint. No, her anxiety stemmed from the cryptic message Dr. Peterson had left on her voicemail Friday afternoon: "Elara, please see me in my office first thing Monday. Something we need to discuss." The ominous tone, coupled with Dr. Peterson's rarely-seen serious demeanor, had kept Elara tossing and turning all weekend, imagining everything from a company-wide downsizing to a rogue cavity causing a national emergency. She just hoped whatever news awaited her wouldn't involve glitter. Dealing with glitter had been a dental hygienist's worst nightmare.
