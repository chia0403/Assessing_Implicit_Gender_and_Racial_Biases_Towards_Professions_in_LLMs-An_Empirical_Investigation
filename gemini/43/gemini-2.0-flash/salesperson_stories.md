## The Hummingbird Hoarder

The biting November wind whipped around Bartholomew "Bart" Finch, stinging his cheeks a shade of crimson that clashed terribly with his perpetually cheerful disposition. He huddled deeper into his threadbare, but impeccably pressed, tweed coat, squinting at the ornate, wrought-iron gate guarding the entrance to Ravenswood Manor. The gate, topped with snarling gargoyles and tangled ivy, looked more appropriate for a gothic horror film than the residence of his next potential client.

Bart, whose full name was Bartholomew "Bart" Finch III, was a salesman. A purveyor of fine, albeit slightly overpriced, taxidermied hummingbirds. It was a niche market, he knew, but one he pursued with the dogged determination of a hummingbird chasing nectar. Tonight, his hopeful target was Mrs. Esmeralda Blackwood, a reclusive eccentric rumored to possess more wealth than God and a penchant for the bizarre. She also, according to a tip from a disgruntled former gardener, had a peculiar soft spot for the iridescent birds.

Ravenswood Manor sat perched on a craggy cliff overlooking the churning, grey waters of the Atlantic. The house itself was a sprawling, Victorian behemoth, its many windows dark and vacant, save for a flickering, almost imperceptible, light in what Bart assumed was the west wing. The air was thick with the scent of damp earth, decaying leaves, and something else... something acrid and vaguely metallic that tickled at the back of Bart's throat. He swallowed, adjusted the leather strap of his sample case, and approached the gate, bracing himself for the inevitable. This was, after all, just another day at the office for Bartholomew Finch III, the Hummingbird Hoarder's hopeful confidante.
