Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a main character named a guard:

**Setting:**

The salt spray stung Silas Blackwood's face as he patrolled the ramparts of Fort Albatross. The fortress, a hulking behemoth of grey stone, clung precariously to the jagged cliffs overlooking the Tempest Sea. Built centuries ago to guard the treacherous Strait of Whispers, Fort Albatross was now more of a monument to forgotten wars than a true deterrent. The wind howled a mournful song through the crenellations, a constant reminder of the isolation and the relentless power of the sea. Below, waves crashed against the rocks with a force that shook the very foundations of the fort. Inland, the only visible sign of civilization was the faint smudge of smoke rising from the distant fishing village of Porthaven, a lifeline tethering the fort to the world. The air was thick with the scent of brine, seaweed, and the lingering memory of battles fought and lost.

**Story Opening:**

Silas Blackwood, his weathered face etched with the harsh lines of a life spent exposed to the elements, adjusted the strap of his leather breastplate. The metal was cold against his chest, a constant, grounding sensation. He spat over the edge of the rampart, the spittle disappearing instantly in the swirling wind. Another uneventful dawn at Fort Albatross. Or so it seemed. He’d seen enough uneventful dawns bleed into desperate, violent nights to trust appearances. A flock of gulls screeched overhead, their cries echoing the persistent anxiety that gnawed at the edges of Silas's mind. Something felt different this morning. The air itself seemed charged, buzzing with a subtle energy that prickled the hairs on the back of his neck. He scanned the horizon, his gaze sweeping from the turbulent waves to the hazy outline of the Serpent’s Tooth, a jagged island that marked the western boundary of the strait. Nothing. Just the relentless sea and the rising sun painting the sky in hues of bruised purple and angry orange. But the feeling wouldn't leave him. A shadow of a premonition, as cold and relentless as the Tempest Sea itself, settled deep within his gut. And Silas Blackwood knew, with the certainty that only years of experience could provide, that today, Fort Albatross would face something more than just another empty dawn.
