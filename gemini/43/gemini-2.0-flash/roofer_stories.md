The relentless August sun beat down on the shingles like a malevolent drummer, each thwack a reminder of the dwindling water in John Michael Davies' thermos. He wiped sweat from his brow, the familiar sting of salt mingling with the gritty dust of asphalt that perpetually clung to his skin. Below him, the sleepy suburb of Meadow Creek shimmered in the heat haze, its perfectly manicured lawns and identical beige houses blurring into an unsettling, monotonous canvas.

He was perched precariously on the steeply pitched roof of 42 Maple Drive, a craftsman bungalow sporting a particularly stubborn case of moss and a homeowner with a penchant for complaining about "every tiny little imperfection." John Michael, known to most as just "Davies" and to himself, in moments of quiet reflection, as a man slowly turning into a dried prune, sighed and shifted his weight. Heâ€™d been roofing in Meadow Creek for twenty years, long enough to see the original apple orchards plowed under and replaced with this endless expanse of cookie-cutter conformity. And today, more than any other day, he felt every one of those twenty years in his aching back and sun-baked skin.
