The biting wind whipped off the Atlantic, stinging Thomas “Tommy” Ashton’s cheeks as he wrestled with the heavy, rusted panel box. Salt spray had eaten away at the paint, leaving a mottled landscape of orange and brown corrosion that flaked off with every touch. He cursed under his breath, the frigid air turning his breath into fleeting puffs of white. This wasn't exactly how he'd pictured his Tuesday.

The setting was the craggy, unforgiving coastline of Monhegan Island, Maine, a tiny speck of granite and scrub pine stubbornly resisting the relentless ocean. The year was 1987, and the island, while picturesque, was clinging to a bygone era. The year-round residents, a hardy lot of fishermen, artists, and descendants of both, relied heavily on the few aging generators and haphazardly wired homes for their meager power.

Tommy, recently graduated from electrical school in Portland and eager to prove himself, had been hired by the island's sole electrician, old Silas, a gruff man with hands like weathered driftwood and a vocabulary peppered with salty oaths. Silas, nearing eighty and weary, had grudgingly accepted Tommy as an apprentice, more out of necessity than a genuine desire for mentorship. He'd grumbled constantly about “city boys” and their fancy gadgets, but he needed someone to climb the poles and crawl into the damp basements.

The current job, a complete rewire of the island's oldest lighthouse, was a beast. The original wiring, installed sometime around the turn of the century, was a tangled mess of cloth-insulated wire, some of it brittle as dried seaweed. Silas suspected rodents had been feasting on it for decades. Tommy knew, with a sinking feeling, that this job would be the ultimate test of his skills, his patience, and his ability to withstand the unforgiving embrace of Monhegan Island. He just hoped he could survive Silas long enough to finish it.
