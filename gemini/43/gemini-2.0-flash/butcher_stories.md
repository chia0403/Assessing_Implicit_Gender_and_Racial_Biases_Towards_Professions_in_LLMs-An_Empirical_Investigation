Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a story about a butcher named Evelyn Marguerite Dubois:

**Setting:**

The biting wind, straight off the North Sea, whipped around the cobbled square of Steenwijk, Netherlands. The air, thick with the promise of snow, smelled of woodsmoke, damp stone, and, faintly, the savory tang of sausage from Evelyn Marguerite Dubois’ shop, “Dubois’ Delights.”  Steenwijk, a town steeped in history and surrounded by canals, had a quiet, almost sleepy charm during the winter months.  Most of the tourist boats were tucked away in dry dock, their painted bows covered with canvas. The locals, however, still braved the weather, their faces ruddy and determined as they hurried to and fro, seeking warmth and sustenance.  Dubois' Delights stood on the corner of the square, a small, cheerful beacon with its red-and-white striped awning and the inviting glow of the hanging lamps inside.  Christmas lights, already strung across the storefront, flickered sporadically in the increasing gloom.

**Story Opening:**

Evelyn Marguerite Dubois wiped her hands on her starched white apron, the scent of rosemary and pork clinging to the fabric. The blade of her cleaver flashed under the shop's bright lights as she expertly separated a rack of ribs, her movements precise and practiced after a lifetime behind the counter. Outside, the wind howled a little louder, rattling the old windowpanes. She sighed, a puff of warm breath fogging the air in front of her.  It was late, later than she’d intended to stay. Jan Veenstra, the baker across the square, had popped in an hour ago, predicting a snowstorm by morning and buying enough bread to last him through Armageddon, or at least the next few days. The thought made Evelyn smile. Jan was a dear, and his crusty sourdough was the perfect accompaniment to her smoked sausage. But his visit had also reminded her that she needed to close up, and soon. The last customer, a frail old woman named Mevrouw de Groot, had shuffled out clutching a carefully wrapped package of *rookworst*, her usual Saturday treat. Now, only the rhythmic tick-tock of the antique clock above the cash register and the crackling hum of the butcher's refrigerator disturbed the quiet. Evelyn straightened her apron, a sliver of concern pinching her brow.  A new delivery of venison was due in from the neighboring farm, and given the weather, she hoped Klaas, the farmer, wouldn't be delayed. Venison was a delicacy this time of year, and she'd already taken several pre-orders for Christmas Eve. The success of Dubois' Delights depended on her reputation for quality and reliability, something Evelyn had worked tirelessly to maintain since inheriting the shop from her grandfather twenty years ago. As she glanced towards the front door, the bell above it jingled, announcing a visitor. But instead of a familiar face, a figure stood silhouetted against the deepening twilight, cloaked in shadow and a palpable sense of unease.
