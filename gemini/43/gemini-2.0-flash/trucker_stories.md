## Story Opening & Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The jake brake screamed a mournful song down the long, gradual descent. Sweat beaded on Jesse Thorne's forehead, clinging to the salt-and-pepper stubble he hadn't bothered to shave since leaving Albuquerque three days ago. He gripped the steering wheel, the worn leather cool against his calloused palms, and squinted at the endless ribbon of asphalt unspooling before him. Another mile closer to damnation, he thought, another mile closer to fulfilling a promise he regretted making the moment the words left his lips.

**Setting:**

The year is 2042. Jesse Thorne is piloting his Kenworth W900L, a beast of a truck lovingly nicknamed "Betsy," down the I-70 in western Colorado. The landscape is a stark contrast of towering, rust-colored mesas and pockets of surprisingly vibrant green vegetation. In the distance, the snow-capped peaks of the Rocky Mountains pierce the smog-choked sky, a constant reminder of a world struggling under the weight of climate change. The air is thick with a metallic tang, a byproduct of the dwindling oil reserves being aggressively exploited in the surrounding region. Patches of the highway are cracked and repaired with a patchwork of reinforced polymers, a testament to the constant stress of heavy vehicles traversing a crumbling infrastructure. Small, wind-turbine powered recharging stations dot the roadside, catering to the increasing number of electric vehicles, but Betsy, with her roaring diesel engine, remains stubbornly analog in a rapidly digitizing world.
