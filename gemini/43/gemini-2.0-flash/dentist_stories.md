The fluorescent lights of Dr. Eleanor Rose Carmichael’s practice hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the tiny dramas that played out daily in her pristine, white-walled office. Outside, the late afternoon sun was casting long, golden shadows across Willow Creek, Montana, painting the quaint town square in a nostalgic glow. Inside, however, Eleanor was staring into a cavernous maw filled with more sugar than teeth, and the only gold she saw was the glint of old fillings threatening to crumble. The patient, a freckled boy named Billy barely old enough to read, wriggled nervously in the chair, his eyes wide with the dread only a dentist's drill can inspire.

Eleanor sighed internally. Willow Creek was charming, yes, with its snow-capped mountains in the distance and the scent of pine that permeated everything. But charm didn't magically erase the rampant cavities plaguing its youth. Candy apples at the annual rodeo, homemade fudge sold at the farmer's market – Willow Creek thrived on sugar, and Eleanor was fighting a losing battle against its sweet, sticky allure. She adjusted the bright light reflecting off Billy's gagging tongue and forced a smile. "Alright, Billy," she said, her voice as soothing as she could manage. "Let's see if we can evict those sugar bugs, shall we?"
