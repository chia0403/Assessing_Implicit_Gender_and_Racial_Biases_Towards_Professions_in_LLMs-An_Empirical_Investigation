## Story Opening & Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The relentless West Texas sun beat down on Jedediah “Jed” Montgomery’s weathered face as he surveyed the parched expanse before him. Dust devils danced like mischievous spirits across the cracked earth, mocking his efforts. Another year, another drought. Jed spat a wad of chewing tobacco onto the ground, the brown stain quickly absorbed by the thirsty soil. He’d seen droughts before, plenty of them in his fifty-two years, but this one felt different. This one felt like the land itself was giving up. He gripped the worn leather reins of his horse, a bay gelding named Justice, and a grim thought settled in his gut, as heavy and unforgiving as the landscape itself: he might lose it all this time.

**Setting:**

The story is set on the sprawling, arid landscape of West Texas, specifically in the fictional county of Dustbowl, circa 1938, during the tail end of the Dust Bowl era. Jedediah Montgomery's ranch, the "Broken Arrow," is a testament to generations of hard work and resilience, but it's now showing the strain of years of relentless drought and economic hardship. The ranch house, a sturdy but simple structure built from native stone and timber, sits nestled in a shallow valley, offering minimal respite from the harsh elements. Surrounding it are acres of barren pastureland, dotted with hardy mesquite trees and thorny cacti. A dilapidated windmill creaks forlornly, its blades struggling to draw water from the dwindling well. In the distance, the jagged peaks of the Guadalupe Mountains shimmer under the oppressive heat, a constant reminder of the wild, untamed nature that surrounds and permeates every aspect of life in Dustbowl County. The closest town, Harmony Creek, a struggling community clinging to existence, is a dusty collection of weathered buildings, a testament to the hardships endured by its residents. The atmosphere is one of hardship, resilience, and a stubborn hope clinging to the promise of rain.
