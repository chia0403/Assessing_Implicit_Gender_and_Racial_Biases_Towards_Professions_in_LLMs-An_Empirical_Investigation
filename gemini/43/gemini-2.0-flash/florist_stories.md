## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The perpetually damp, perpetually charming city of Edinburgh, Scotland, in late October. The sky is a bruised purple, threatening rain, and the cobblestone streets are slick with a sheen that reflects the gas lamps flickering to life. A biting wind whips down from Arthur's Seat, rustling the skeletal branches of the ancient trees that line the Royal Mile.

**Opening:**

Flora Mackenzie, her breath clouding the cool air, wrestled with a particularly unruly bunch of crimson anemones. The petals, fragile as butterfly wings, threatened to tear in her gloved hands. “Bloody things,” she muttered, tucking a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear.  She was already running late, the flower shop, "Thistle & Thorne," a riot of colour and scent crammed into a tiny nook off Cockburn Street, a testament to her less-than-perfect time management skills.

Outside, the clamour of Edinburgh's rush hour intensified – the rumble of buses, the shrill cry of gulls, the clipped tones of tourists bartering for souvenirs. Flora barely registered it. Inside her floral sanctuary, the world narrowed to the velvety depths of a rose, the spiky defiance of a thistle, the ephemeral beauty of a single, perfect bloom. Today, though, even the flowers felt…off.  A sense of unease, sharp and prickly as the thorns she handled daily, had been clinging to her all morning, settling heavy in her chest. She couldn't shake the feeling that something extraordinary, and possibly unwelcome, was about to blossom into her life.
