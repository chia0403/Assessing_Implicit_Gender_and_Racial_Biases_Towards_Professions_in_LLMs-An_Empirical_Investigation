## Opening:

The fluorescent lights of the office hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Eleanor Beatrice Ainsworth's Thursday evening ritual: staring intensely at a spreadsheet filled with numbers that refused to behave. The late hour painted long, distorted shadows of potted plants and abandoned coffee cups across the room, turning the familiar space into something almost theatrical. Outside, the city throbbed with life, a vibrant pulse Eleanor could feel faintly through the glass of the 14th-floor window. But here, trapped in the purgatory of quarterly reports, life feltâ€¦ sterile.

Eleanor rubbed her tired eyes, the bridge of her nose throbbing. Another error. Row 37, column F. A discrepancy of $17.43. An insignificant amount, maybe, to someone facing bankruptcy. But to Eleanor, it was a cosmic imbalance, a personal affront to the very principles of accounting. Principles, she often thought, that were far more reliable than people. She sighed, the sound barely audible above the drone of the lights. Just one more error to chase down before she could finally escape.

## Setting:

The offices of "Crestwood Financial," located on the 14th floor of the "Beacon Tower" in downtown Chicago. The decor is bland and corporate: beige walls, grey carpet, generic artwork featuring abstract shapes in shades of blue and green. Individual cubicles are separated by fabric-covered partitions, each a small, self-contained workspace littered with papers, files, and the occasional motivational poster. The air is perpetually dry and slightly stale, a mixture of recycled air and the lingering scent of stale coffee. The large, plate glass windows offer a panoramic view of the city, a stark contrast to the monotonous interior. The overall atmosphere is one of quiet industry, punctuated by the rhythmic tapping of keyboards and the occasional hushed phone conversation. It's a space designed for efficiency and productivity, but one that ultimately feels sterile and devoid of personality.
