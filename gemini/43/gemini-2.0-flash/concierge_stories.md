Okay, here's a story opening and setting, featuring a concierge named Alistair Finch:

**Setting:** The Grand Zenith Hotel, Vienna, Austria. The hotel occupies a converted 19th-century palace in the heart of the Innere Stadt (Inner City). It's known for its opulent décor – think soaring ceilings, crystal chandeliers, and marble floors polished to a mirror sheen – and its clientele, which ranges from visiting dignitaries and film stars to wealthy families and history enthusiasts.

**Story Opening:**

The scent of freshly baked Sachertorte and polished mahogany hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Alistair Finch as he surveyed the Grand Zenith’s lobby. He smoothed a nonexistent wrinkle from his impeccably tailored, midnight blue suit, his gaze sweeping over the hushed elegance: the shimmering chandelier, the crimson roses overflowing from their marble vases, the quiet murmur of multilingual conversations. Alistair knew every tile of this floor, every thread of the antique Persian rugs. He knew the preferred brand of champagne for the Russian Ambassador, the best route to the Belvedere Palace avoiding the worst of the tourist throngs, and the exact time the first strudel came out of the oven in the hotel’s legendary pastry kitchen.

Alistair Finch was the Grand Zenith’s head concierge, and he prided himself on anticipating every guest's needs, even those they hadn't yet conceived. His life was a carefully orchestrated symphony of whispered requests, discreet arrangements, and effortless solutions. Until, that is, the arrival of the woman with the sapphire eyes and a request that threatened to unravel everything he held dear. She had approached his desk just moments ago, her voice a low, melodious hum that sent a shiver down his spine.

“Mr. Finch,” she'd said, her gaze unwavering, “I need you to find something for me. Something that shouldn't exist anymore."
