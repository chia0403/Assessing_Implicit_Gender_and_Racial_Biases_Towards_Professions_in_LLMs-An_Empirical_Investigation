## Story Opening:

The damp chill of the morning air clung to Eleanor Josephine Bellweather's thick, woolen gloves as she unlocked the heavy padlock on the gate of the Nocturnal Enclosure. The lock clicked with a satisfyingly loud *thunk*, a sound that echoed in the pre-dawn quiet of the Greater Woodland Park Zoo. Inside, the air hung thick with the musky scent of damp earth and nocturnal creatures stirring from their slumber. Eleanor shivered, but not entirely from the cold. There was always a certain magic to being alone with the zoo's night inhabitants, a sense of privileged access to a world hidden from most eyes. Tonight, however, that magic felt tinged with apprehension.

Yesterday’s storm had been particularly ferocious, and Eleanor had spent a sleepless night fretting about the animals in her care. Had the ancient oak tree in the Screech Owl habitat held fast? Had the river otter dens flooded? And most importantly, had Artemis, the elderly snow leopard who suffered from chronic anxiety, weathered the tempest without too much distress? Eleanor pushed the heavy gate open, the rusty hinges groaning a mournful welcome. The first tendrils of dawn were beginning to paint the sky a pale, watery grey, casting long, distorted shadows across the pathway. She took a deep breath, the humid air filling her lungs, and stepped inside. Today was going to be a long one.

## Setting:

The Greater Woodland Park Zoo is a sprawling oasis of biodiversity nestled in the heart of a bustling, unnamed city. Established in the late 19th century, it boasts a charmingly antiquated aesthetic, with brick pathways winding through lush, meticulously landscaped habitats. The Nocturnal Enclosure, where Eleanor Josephine Bellweather works, is located on the furthest edge of the zoo, tucked away from the crowds and designed to mimic the natural environments of its inhabitants. It’s a carefully crafted ecosystem, complete with a meandering artificial river, rocky outcroppings, and dense vegetation.

During the day, the enclosure appears quiet and subdued, the nocturnal creatures mostly hidden away in their dens and burrows. But at night, it comes alive with rustling leaves, hooting owls, and the silent, predatory movements of animals adapted to life in the shadows. Eleanor, with her decades of experience, knows every nook and cranny of this enclosure, every animal’s individual quirks and preferences. It’s her domain, her sanctuary, and the well-being of its inhabitants is her utmost priority. The aroma of damp earth and wild creatures permeates everything, a constant reminder of the delicate balance she works tirelessly to maintain.
