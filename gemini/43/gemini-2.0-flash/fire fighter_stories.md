The smell of burnt sugar hung thick in the air, a cloying sweetness that did little to mask the underlying acrid tang of melted plastic and charred wood. Rain lashed against the smeared windows of the pumper truck, blurring the scene outside into an impressionistic nightmare of flashing red and yellow.

Built in the early 1900s, the five-story brick behemoth was a local landmark, though it had fallen into disrepair after being shuttered fifteen years prior. Now, it was little more than a shell, a concrete ghost haunting the waterfront. The rain seemed to mock its dilapidated state, seeping into cracks and crevices, feeding the flames that had now taken hold with a ravenous hunger.
