## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The air in Dr. Alistair Finch's office hung thick with the aroma of lavender and unspoken anxieties. The room, on the third floor of a converted Victorian house in Brookline, Massachusetts, was carefully curated for serenity. Soft, muted blues adorned the walls, a Persian rug muffled the sounds of the bustling street below, and a small, bubbling fountain provided a soothing counterpoint to the city's discordant symphony. Sunlight, strained through lace curtains, painted gentle patterns on the antique writing desk where Alistair usually sat, meticulously documenting his sessions. Today, however, he stood by the window, his back to the empty leather armchair that usually held his patients.

**Opening:** Dr. Alistair Finch stared out at the slate rooftops of Brookline, his breath fogging the cool glass. He wasn't looking at the houses, though. He was staring, unseeing, at the relentless, grey Massachusetts sky, mirroring the relentless, grey cloud that had settled in his own mind. Today, he was not playing the role of the calm, empathetic healer. Today, he was simply Alistair, a man facing a precipice. The phone had rung only an hour ago, a voice crackling with static and a chillingly familiar name. A name he hadn't heard, hadn't *allowed* himself to hear, in twenty years. And with that single, whispered name, the careful construct of his life, the serene bubble he had so painstakingly cultivated, had begun to fracture. It was a name attached to a memory, a buried trauma, a secret he had sworn to take to his grave. And now, it was clawing its way back to the surface, threatening to consume him whole. The voice had said only three words: "She knows everything."
