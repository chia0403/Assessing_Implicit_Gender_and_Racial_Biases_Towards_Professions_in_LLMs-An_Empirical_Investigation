Okay, here's a story opening and setting, keeping the focus on introducing our nutritionist character and hinting at a potential conflict or mystery:

**Setting:** The crisp October air swirled fallen leaves against the pristine windows of "Vitality Bites," a small, sun-drenched nutrition clinic nestled in the upscale, health-conscious neighborhood of Oakwood Heights, Portland, Oregon. The interior was a calming oasis of soft greens and natural wood, filled with the subtle scent of aromatherapy oils and the quiet hum of a Himalayan salt lamp. Books on mindful eating and the glycemic index lined the shelves, and a miniature herb garden thrived in a sun-drenched corner.

**Opening:**

Eleanor Grace Cartwright, a woman whose own perpetually glowing skin and vibrant energy testified to the efficacy of her nutritional philosophies, meticulously arranged a plate of sliced bell peppers, vibrant green cucumbers, and juicy cherry tomatoes. She caught her reflection in the polished steel of her countertop - a calm, focused face framed by a cascade of auburn curls. This was her sanctuary, her place of purpose. But today, a knot of unease twisted in Eleanor’s stomach, a discomfort that had nothing to do with the ethically-sourced chia seeds she usually added to her morning smoothie.

The source of the disquiet sat in the waiting room, flipping impatiently through a dog-eared copy of "Paleo Power," a woman named Mrs. Beatrice Ainsworth. Eleanor had been seeing her for almost a month, and while Mrs. Ainsworth was diligently following her customized meal plan, something about her felt off. The elderly woman's initial eagerness had morphed into a guarded skepticism, punctuated by cryptic questions about the origin of Eleanor’s recipes and the previous owners of the clinic. It was a subtle shift, but it was enough to make Eleanor’s usually tranquil world feel…tainted. And now, Mrs. Ainsworth was late, by almost an hour.

Eleanor sighed, carefully covering the cut vegetables. Usually, Mrs. Ainsworth was punctual to a fault. Perhaps this time, her late arrival would finally bring the unsettling truth with it. The door chime rang, shattering the silence, and Eleanor straightened, a professional smile plastered on her face. "Good morning, Mrs. Ainsworth," she began, but the woman who stood framed in the doorway was not Beatrice, and there was not one thing good about this morning.
