## Story Opening:

The late afternoon sun, a viscous honey color, dripped through the towering, paned windows of the Grand Astoria Hotel's presidential suite, turning the dust motes dancing in the air into shimmering constellations. Eleanor Vance, her perfectly coiffed blonde bob bouncing gently against her silk scarf, squinted. Even through her signature oversized tortoise shell glasses, the light was blinding. She held a paint swatch, "Benjamin Moore's Cloud White," up against the elaborate crown molding, comparing it to the existing, slightly yellowed, cream.

"Hmm," she murmured, tilting her head. "Too stark. It needs warmth, a whisper of butter."

The current color, a relic of the hotel's gilded age glory days, was a subtle, comforting shade. But comfort, Eleanor knew, didn't sell. The Grand Astoria, a once-proud landmark teetering precariously on the edge of obscurity, was hoping for a resurrection, and Eleanor Vance was the woman tasked with bringing it back to life. She ran a perfectly manicured finger along the worn velvet drapes, their once vibrant crimson now faded to a dusty rose. This room, this entire hotel, needed more than just a fresh coat of paint. It needed a soul infusion, a delicate blend of tradition and modern allure, to lure back the clientele who had long abandoned its opulent halls for sleeker, more contemporary establishments.

**Setting:**

The Grand Astoria Hotel, located in the heart of downtown Philadelphia. It was built in the early 1920s, a testament to the city's booming industrial age. A grand dame of a building, it boasts soaring ceilings, ornate plasterwork, and a faded elegance that speaks of a bygone era. Think "The Shining" without the unsettling twins; more champagne and glittering chandeliers, less axe-wielding madness. The hotel is currently in a state of slow decline, its grandeur overshadowed by newer, more modern hotels that have sprung up around it.
