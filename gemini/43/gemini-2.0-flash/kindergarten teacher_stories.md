## Story Opening:

The aroma of Elmer's glue and stale graham crackers hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume that usually soothed Miss Penelope Beatrice Plumtree. This morning, however, it did nothing to quell the tremor in her hands. Across the linoleum, a tableau of controlled chaos unfolded: five-year-olds, meticulously supervised, were attempting to fashion Mother's Day cards out of glitter, construction paper, and what appeared to be half-eaten goldfish crackers. Penelope swallowed, the lump in her throat refusing to budge. Today was not just another day in the hallowed halls of the Sunny Meadow Kindergarten. Today, she had to tell them.

## Setting:

The Sunny Meadow Kindergarten, a vibrant explosion of primary colors and hand-painted murals, occupied a sunny corner of the Meadowbrook Community Center. Windows overlooking a small, fenced playground allowed for ample natural light, illuminating the artwork proudly displayed on every available surface. The room itself was divided into distinct zones: a reading nook overflowing with well-loved picture books, a block corner boasting a veritable city of wooden structures, an art easel perpetually splattered with tempera paint, and a communal table large enough to accommodate all twenty-two rambunctious students. Worn, but comfortable, the Sunny Meadow Kindergarten was a haven of learning, laughter, and, of course, the lingering scent of glue and crackers. Outside, the predictable hum of suburban life – lawnmowers, delivery trucks, and the occasional barking dog – provided a constant, comforting backdrop to the children's joyful noise.
