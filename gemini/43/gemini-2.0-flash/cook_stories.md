The clatter of copper pots was Maestro Theodore Beaumont's symphony, a chaotic yet harmonious orchestra conducted by the flick of his wrist and the clang of his spatula. He moved through the kitchen with the effortless grace of a seasoned dancer, a whirlwind of crisp white apron and flour-dusted hair. Outside, the morning mist clung to the cobblestones of Rue de la Bourse, blurring the sharp edges of the buildings into a soft, impressionistic painting. But within the brightly lit confines of "Le Canard Enchanté," Theodore was in his element, a culinary conductor about to lead his brigade into the day's service. The aroma of freshly baked croissants battled for dominance with the savory scent of simmering béchamel, creating an olfactory tapestry that promised delights to come. Paris was waking, and Theodore was its gastronomic herald.
