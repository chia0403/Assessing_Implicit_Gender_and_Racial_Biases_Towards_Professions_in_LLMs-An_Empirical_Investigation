## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The flickering fluorescent lights of "Budget Buys," a discount grocery store, hummed a monotonous tune over aisle three, casting long, dusty shadows across stacks of dented cans and slightly withered vegetables. It was a Tuesday afternoon, the lull between the lunch rush and the pre-dinner scramble. The linoleum floor, worn smooth by years of shuffling feet, smelled faintly of bleach and despair.

**Opening:**

Margaret Eleanor Davies stared blankly at the expired coupon for "Save $0.50 on Generic Brand Pickles" clutched in Mrs. Henderson's gnarled hand. Mrs. Henderson, a regular, always tried to sneak expired coupons past Margaret. It was a game they played, a small, predictable ritual in the vast, unpredictable monotony of her life. "I'm sorry, Mrs. Henderson," Margaret said, her voice flat and practiced, the words tasting like stale coffee on her tongue. "This one expired last Tuesday." Mrs. Henderson sighed dramatically, a sound that could rival the hiss of a deflating tire, and Margaret braced herself for the inevitable argument. It was just another day at Budget Buys.
