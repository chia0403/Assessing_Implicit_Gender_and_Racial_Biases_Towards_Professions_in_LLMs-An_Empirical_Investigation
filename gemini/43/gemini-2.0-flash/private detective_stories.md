## Story Opening:

The cigarette smoke hung heavy in the air, a hazy halo around Reginald Abernathy’s head as he stared out the rain-streaked window. Below, the neon sign of the “Blue Moon Diner” bled a watery, melancholic blue onto the slick streets of Chicago. He’d been nursing the same lukewarm coffee for an hour, the bitter taste mirroring the knot of unease tightening in his gut. Outside, the city hummed with a restless energy, oblivious to the fact that Reginald Abernathy, Private Investigator, was about to walk into a situation so sticky, it would make a Chicago dog look positively pristine. The buzz of the rotary phone on his desk was a jarring intrusion. He knew who it was. He'd been expecting it. He’d been dreading it.

## Setting:

Reginald Abernathy's office occupied the entire sixth floor of the "Majestic Building," a once-grand art deco structure slowly succumbing to the relentless march of time and the city's indifference. The building was located on the fringes of the Loop, a location Reginald could just barely afford. The office itself was a study in controlled chaos. Stacks of old newspapers, dog-eared files, and half-eaten sandwiches competed for space on every surface. A worn leather armchair sat squarely in the center of the room, facing a scarred oak desk littered with photographs, ashtrays, and a half-empty bottle of rye. The walls were a pale, nicotine-stained beige, punctuated by framed black and white photos of Reginald's past cases – grim reminders of the darkness lurking beneath the city's glittering façade. The only splash of color came from a vibrant, albeit slightly dusty, painting of a jazz band, a gift from a grateful client many years ago. The whole place smelled faintly of stale coffee, cigarette smoke, and desperation – the quintessential scent of a Chicago private detective.
