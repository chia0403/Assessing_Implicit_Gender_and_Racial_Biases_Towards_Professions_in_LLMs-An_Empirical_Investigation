## Story Opening & Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The flickering gas lamp cast dancing shadows across the cluttered workbench, barely illuminating the intricate clockwork device that occupied Dr. Eleanor Vance's full attention. A bead of sweat trickled down her temple, reflecting the lamplight as she painstakingly adjusted a tiny cog with a pair of slender tweezers. Outside, the incessant London fog pressed against the leaded glass windows of her laboratory, a damp, gray shroud muffling the sounds of the city. Eleanor bit her lip, her breath held captive in her chest. Almost there. One final adjustment. The air in the small room, thick with the scent of ozone and antique oils, crackled with a palpable anticipation. She just needed to see it work, just once, before the Royal Society dismissed her theories as the ramblings of a fanciful woman.

**Setting:**

The year is 1888. Dr. Eleanor Vance's personal laboratory is located in a converted attic room atop her late father's townhouse in the Bloomsbury district of London. The room is crammed with scientific instruments, from gleaming brass telescopes to dusty anatomical models. Shelves overflow with leather-bound journals, forgotten experiments, and strange specimens preserved in jars of formaldehyde. The walls are painted a faded pea-green, stained with chemical splashes and covered with meticulously drawn diagrams of celestial bodies and intricate mechanical schematics. A large, ornate Persian rug attempts to soften the hard lines of the wooden floorboards, but years of neglect have left it worn and faded. The room is a testament to a life dedicated to scientific inquiry, a sanctuary for Eleanor's unconventional pursuits in a world that often prefers its women to remain quietly domestic.
