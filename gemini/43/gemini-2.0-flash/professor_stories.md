## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The biting wind whipped off the churning Atlantic, clawing at the ancient stone walls of Dunvarra Castle. Perched precariously on a craggy headland in County Donegal, Ireland, the castle was less a bastion of luxury and more a testament to stubborn endurance. Its grey stones were pockmarked with centuries of storms, and the interior, despite sporadic renovations, still retained a damp, chill air that seeped into the bones. Tonight, a particularly violent squall rattled the leaded windows and howled through the battlements, making conversation in the small library a near impossible task.

**Opening:** Professor Alistair Humphrey Finch, his tweed jacket doing little to ward off the pervasive damp, squinted at the brittle parchment illuminated by the flickering gaslight. He ran a calloused finger along the faded script, muttering to himself. "Centum anni...one hundred years..." The wind rattled the windowpanes again, making him jump. He hated these trips. Hated the isolation, hated the inherent romanticism everyone else seemed to find in these desolate places. He much preferred the warm, predictable comfort of his Oxford office and the company of his scholarly peers. But the lure of this particular document, unearthed only last week from a hidden alcove within the castle walls, had proven too strong to resist. It was a page ripped from what appeared to be a grimoire, detailing a ritual to... well, that was the troubling part. A ritual to seemingly bind something. Something powerful. And something ancient. The storm outside intensified, mirroring the growing unease in Alistair's gut. This wasn't just historical research anymore. This feltâ€¦ different. He shivered, pulling his jacket tighter. He wasn't sure he liked different. Not one bit.
