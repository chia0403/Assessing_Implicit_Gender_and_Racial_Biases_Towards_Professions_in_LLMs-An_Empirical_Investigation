The scent of pine and sawdust clung to Elias Thorne like a second skin. Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the weathered clapboard of his workshop, painting the surrounding Vermont forest in hues of amber and gold. Inside, the air was thick with the quiet hum of electricity and the promise of creation. Elias, a man whose hands were more eloquent than his tongue, ran a calloused thumb over the smooth curve of a cherry wood rocking horse, a commission for little Maisie down in Jericho. He’d been putting the finishing touches on it all day, smoothing out the rough edges until it was as gentle to the touch as a lover’s caress. But something still felt…off.

The shop, a converted barn his grandfather had built, was Elias' sanctuary. Tools hung neatly on pegboards, each in its designated place, a testament to his meticulous nature. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows, illuminating the piles of lumber stacked against the walls: oak, maple, walnut, each with its own unique grain and story waiting to be told. On a workbench littered with shavings lay his worn leather apron, stained with years of use, and a chipped porcelain mug half-filled with lukewarm coffee. This was where Elias Thorne felt most alive, surrounded by the raw potential of wood and the boundless possibilities of his craft. But today, even in this familiar haven, a sense of unease gnawed at him, a splinter under his skin that he couldn't quite dislodge. It had been there all week, ever since the letter arrived, a thick, cream-colored envelope bearing the crest of Blackwood Manor.
