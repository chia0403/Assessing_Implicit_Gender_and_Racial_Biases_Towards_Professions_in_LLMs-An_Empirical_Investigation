## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The echoing, pre-dawn hush of the Grand Majestic Theatre, a faded art-deco palace in downtown Astoria, Oregon. Red velvet curtains, thick with dust and the lingering scent of decades of performers, hang heavy over the vast stage. Rows of empty, plush seats stretch into the darkness, their once vibrant colors now muted by time and neglect. Outside, the Pacific Ocean whispers a constant, salty refrain against the pilings of the nearby docks.

**Story Opening:**

The squeak of the mop was the only sound cutting through the cavernous silence. Bartholomew "Bart" Featherstone, his grey work shirt clinging damply to his back, sighed and shifted his weight. He’d been mopping these same cracked tiles for twenty-three years, and some mornings, like this one, the weight of all those years felt heavier than the bucket of soapy water he was lugging. The Grand Majestic Theatre, once the glittering jewel of Astoria, was now mostly just a graveyard for broken dreams and forgotten melodies. Bart, its unassuming custodian, was its only keeper, diligently scrubbing away the grime and hoping, against all logic, that one day the lights would shine bright again. He paused, wiping his brow with a forearm, and gazed up at the vast, ornate ceiling, a swirling tapestry of faded gold leaf and chipped plaster angels. He could almost hear the phantom applause, the soaring notes of forgotten operas, the rustle of silk gowns – a symphony of ghosts swirling in the dust motes dancing in the sliver of pre-dawn light that snuck in through the boarded-up side door. He closed his eyes for a moment, letting the echoes wash over him. This theatre wasn't just a job; it was in his blood, a silent story he felt compelled to tell, even if no one was listening. But today, something felt different. A prickle on the back of his neck, a deeper silence than usual, a whisper that felt less like a memory and more like…a promise.
