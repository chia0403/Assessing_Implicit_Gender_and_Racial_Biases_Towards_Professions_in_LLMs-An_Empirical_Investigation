The flickering fluorescent lights of the Midwest Mutual Insurance office hummed a monotonous dirge, a fitting soundtrack to the Tuesday afternoon slump that had settled over Des Moines. A half-eaten ham and swiss sandwich sat forlornly on Bernard Quincy Abernathyâ€™s desk, a victim of his dwindling appetite. He hadn't been hungry since Mrs. Henderson's shih tzu, Princess Fluffybutt, had relieved itself on his new wingtips. Some days, insuring against unforeseen misfortune felt less like a service and more like a cruel cosmic joke at his expense.

Bernard, a man whose comb-over was as meticulously planned as his sales pitches, sighed and swiveled in his creaky office chair. Outside, the relentless Iowa sun beat down on the parking lot, turning the asphalt into a shimmering mirage. Across the street, the faded sign of "Penny's Pies - Best Cherry in Town!" offered a sugary temptation he desperately wanted to resist. He'd been trying to cut back on the sugar, a losing battle, especially when faced with the daily barrage of paperwork and the constant threat of another canine-related incident. He glanced at the framed photo of his wife, Martha, and their prize-winning zucchini, a constant reminder of the simpler, less insurance-adjacent, life he sometimes dreamed of. Today, however, the dreams felt far away, and the fluorescent lights, the uninspiring lunch, and the weight of insuring the entire tri-county area pressed down on him with the force of a collapsing policy.
