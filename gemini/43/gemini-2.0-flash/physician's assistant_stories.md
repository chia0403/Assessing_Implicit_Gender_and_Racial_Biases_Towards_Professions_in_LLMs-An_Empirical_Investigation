## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The air in the waiting room of the "Coastal Family Practice" hung thick with the humidity of a late July morning in Charleston, South Carolina. Spanish moss, usually a romantic adornment on the live oak trees lining the street, clung to the branches like a damp, gray shroud. Inside, the muted pastel walls and the incessant drone of the air conditioner did little to alleviate the sticky discomfort. Scattered copies of "Southern Living" and "Field & Stream" lay wilting on the side tables, untouched casualties of the digital age.

**Story Opening:**

The rhythmic thump of a baby's foot against Dr. Henderson's examining room door was the only sound breaking through the orchestrated calm when **Margaret "Maggie" Eleanor Hawthorne**, Physician's Assistant extraordinaire, finally had a free moment. She leaned back in her swivel chair, the worn vinyl creaking in protest, and closed her eyes. The scent of antiseptic and stale coffee clung to the air, a constant reminder of the relentless demands of her job. Just ten minutes, she pleaded silently, ten minutes to clear her head before Mrs. Abernathy and her suspiciously self-diagnosed case of "Charleston Crud" arrived. She massaged the bridge of her nose, feeling the pressure building. It wasn't just the endless stream of patients, the relentless paperwork, or even Dr. Henderson's constant demands for her to "smooth things over" with the occasional disgruntled patient. Something else was brewing, a disquiet she couldn't quite put her finger on, and the humid Charleston air felt thick with its approach. The thump against the door intensified, punctuated by a high-pitched wail. Maggie sighed, the brief respite already shattered. Time to get back to work. The Charleston Crud, she thought, suddenly feeling a kinship with Mrs. Abernathy. Maybe she had it too.
