**Story Opening:**

The air hung thick and heavy, a swampy blanket clinging to the Louisiana asphalt. Even before the sun fully breached the horizon, the heat was oppressive, promising another day where sweat would glue cotton to skin and the only respite would be the fleeting shadow of a passing eighteen-wheeler. Dewey "Duke" Beaumont sighed, the sound barely audible over the idling drone of the road grader. He wiped a forearm across his brow, leaving a smear of orange safety paint and grime. He hated this part of the morning, the anticipation of the day's labor, the sheer, unforgiving monotony of it all. But he loved the satisfaction of a job well done, the smooth, newly paved road stretching out behind him, a testament to his own hard work.

**Setting:**

The story is set on a long, desolate stretch of Highway 90 in south Louisiana, specifically in the heart of Terrebonne Parish. The highway runs parallel to a network of canals and bayous, often obscured by dense cypress forests draped with Spanish moss. The air is perpetually humid, smelling of brackish water, decaying vegetation, and the ever-present exhaust fumes from passing trucks. The landscape is flat and featureless, broken only by the occasional gas station, bait shop, or weathered billboard advertising seafood restaurants in nearby Houma. The sun beats down mercilessly on the exposed asphalt, turning the highway into a shimmering mirage in the summer months. The only sounds are the constant drone of traffic, the buzzing of cicadas, and the occasional cry of a heron circling overhead. This is a land of hard work, slow living, and a deep, unspoken connection to the land.
