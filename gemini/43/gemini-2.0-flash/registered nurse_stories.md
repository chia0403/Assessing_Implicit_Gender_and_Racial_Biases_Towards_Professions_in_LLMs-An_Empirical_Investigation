## Opening:

The sterile scent of antiseptic and stale coffee was a familiar comfort to Evelyn Grace Montgomery. It clung to her scrubs, permeated her hair, and, if she was being honest, probably seeped into her very soul. Tonight, however, the comfort was thin, easily overshadowed by the rhythmic beeping of the cardiac monitor in Room 304 and the laboured breaths rasping from the patient in the bed. Evelyn smoothed the damp hair back from the elderly man's forehead, her fingers lingering for a moment longer than necessary. He was failing fast, and she knew it. She just hoped he wasn't alone.

## Setting:

The story takes place in **St. Jude's Mercy Hospital**, a sprawling, modern structure dominating the skyline of **Willow Creek, Montana**. The town itself is small, nestled in a valley carved by the Clearwater River, known for its stunning mountain views and tight-knit community. St. Jude's is the only major hospital within a hundred-mile radius, serving a diverse population ranging from ranchers and farmers to affluent retirees seeking a quiet life. The Emergency Room and the Intensive Care Unit, where Evelyn spends most of her shifts, are a microcosm of this community - a chaotic blend of urgency, vulnerability, and quiet strength. The fluorescent lights hum overhead, casting a clinical glow on the worn linoleum floors and the ever-present clutter of medical equipment. Despite its modern facade, St. Jude's carries a certain small-town charm, a feeling fostered by the dedicated staff who often know their patients on a first-name basis and treat them as neighbours, not just numbers.
