## Opening:

The fluorescent lights of the open house hummed a discordant tune, a fitting soundtrack to Penelope Ainsworth's growing sense of dread. It wasn't just the beige on beige on beige that threatened to swallow her whole. It was the eerie stillness of the place, despite the advertised open house having been in full swing for the past hour. No potential buyers milled about, no children clamored over the meticulously staged living room, no couples whispered about paint swatches and future furniture layouts. Just Penelope, her silent partner - a wilted fern on the kitchen island - and the oppressive silence of 12 Maplewood Lane.

## Setting:

**Location:** Willow Creek, Pennsylvania, a quaint town nestled in the Pocono Mountains. Think charming main street with antique shops, sprawling Victorian houses with wraparound porches, and a pervasive sense of wholesome Americana that feels slightly too perfect.

**Time:** A crisp Saturday afternoon in late October, just a few weeks before Halloween. The air is thick with the scent of fallen leaves and woodsmoke.

**Atmosphere:** Initially, Willow Creek presents as idyllic and comforting. However, beneath the surface, there's a palpable unease, a lingering sense of secrets held close. The vibrant fall foliage seems almost too bright, a vibrant facade masking something darker lurking beneath. 12 Maplewood Lane itself is a newly constructed suburban home, starkly out of place amongst the older, more established residences. It's pristine, almost sterile, and lacks the warmth and character of the surrounding homes, contributing to Penelope's unsettling feeling.
