## The Story Opening:

The low hum of the crowd was a living thing, vibrating up through the floorboards and into Seren Rhys's bare feet. She stood in the wings of the small, smoky jazz club, the dim lighting painting her face in shifting chiaroscuro. Her throat felt tighter than a miser's purse strings, a familiar pre-performance anxiety gripping her with icy fingers. Tonight wasn't just any night. Tonight was make-or-break.

She could hear the MC, a gravel-voiced man with a permanent five o'clock shadow and a penchant for bad jokes, winding down his intro. Seren closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and imagined the scent of lavender. It was a trick her grandmother, Blodwyn, had taught her, a grounding technique to ward off the stage fright that had plagued her since she was a little girl singing hymns in the echoing stone church back home.

"And now," the MC bellowed, his voice amplified to a near shriek, "give it up for a rising star, folks! Someone I've been telling you about for weeks! The one, the onlyâ€¦ Seren Rhys!"

The scattered applause, while enthusiastic, was thin. Seren knew the crowd tonight was more populated with industry scouts and skeptical critics than her usual loyal fanbase. This wasn't the cozy, familiar embrace of The Nightingale's Nest, her regular haunt across town. This was "The Velvet Note," a legendary venue, steeped in history and notorious for swallowing up dreams.

She opened her eyes and forced a smile, the lavender momentarily forgotten. Tonight, Seren Rhys wasn't just a girl with a voice; she was a contender. Tonight, she had to sing for her life.

## The Setting:

**The Velvet Note, New Orleans, Louisiana.**

The year is 1958. The Velvet Note is a jazz club steeped in history, located in the heart of the French Quarter. The interior is dimly lit, with velvet drapes the color of aged port wine adorning the walls. Small, round tables are clustered close together, each illuminated by a flickering candle. Smoke hangs heavy in the air, a fragrant blend of cigarettes, cheap whiskey, and the sweet scent of beignets from the nearby cafe.

The stage is small, intimate, and worn smooth from years of countless performances. A vintage microphone stands center stage, reflecting the dim light in its chrome finish. The air is thick with anticipation and a sense of hushed reverence for the legends who have graced this very stage before. The Velvet Note is more than just a club; it's a crucible, a place where dreams are either forged into reality or shattered on the hard cobblestones of ambition.
