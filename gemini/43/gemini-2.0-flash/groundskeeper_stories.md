## Story Opening and Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The rasp of the push mower was the only sound slicing through the pre-dawn stillness. Dewey Bartholomew Higgins, his breath fogging the air, gripped the handle tight, muscles aching despite the caffeine already coursing through his veins. He knew Mrs. Hawthorne, bless her ancient, benevolent soul, wouldn't expect him out this early. But the memory of the prize-winning petunias, now mangled and flattened under the weight of last night's storm, gnawed at him. He hadn't protected them well enough. Shame, a prickly weed he couldn't seem to uproot from his own soul, sprouted anew.

Dewey paused, leaning on the mower. The scent of damp earth and crushed greenery hung thick in the air. Above, the first tentative blush of sunrise painted the sky a delicate lavender, promising a day of unexpected beauty. But even that nascent brilliance couldn't quite pierce the gloom clinging to him. He straightened, adjusting the brim of his worn baseball cap, the logo – "Bartholomew Family Apiary" – nearly faded to nothing. Time to get back to work. He had a garden to salvage, and a reputation to try and rebuild, one meticulous sweep of the mower at a time.

**Setting:**

The story is set in **Hawthorne House**, a sprawling, historic estate perched on a bluff overlooking the dramatic, windswept coastline of **Maine**. The estate is renowned for its meticulously maintained gardens, a vibrant tapestry of colorful flowers, ancient oak trees, and meticulously sculpted hedges. Hawthorne House has been in the Hawthorne family for generations, and its gardens are a beloved landmark in the small, close-knit community of Port Blossom. While the house itself exudes an air of faded grandeur, the gardens, lovingly tended, are a testament to enduring beauty and a haven of tranquility. The house, with its peeling paint and creaky floors, stands in stark contrast to the vibrant life blooming around it, creating a unique and somewhat melancholic atmosphere.
