## Story Opening:

The scent of lemon polish and impending doom hung thick in the air of the Oakhaven Estate library, a mixture Beatrice Eleanor Ainsworth knew all too well. For ten years, she'd wrestled dust bunnies the size of small terriers and coaxed a shine out of the mahogany that could reflect the very soul, all under the watchful, and often disapproving, gaze of the Oakhaven family. But today, something felt different. The silence was heavier, the shadows deeper. Even the portraits of grim-faced ancestors seemed to be scowling with particular malevolence.

Beatrice, her grey hair pulled back in a tight bun that did little to hide the worry lines etched around her kind, blue eyes, paused, feather duster suspended mid-air. A chill, independent of the November draft whistling through the ill-fitting windows, snaked down her spine. It was a feeling she hadn't experienced since... well, since the night old Mr. Silas Oakhaven had succumbed to his heart ailment, right here in this very room.

She shook her head, chiding herself for her superstitious nature. Mr. Edmund Oakhaven, Silas's grandson and the current master of the house, had called her in early this morning with a curt "Beatrice, I need the library spotless. Immediately." He hadn't elaborated, but his pale face and nervous fidgeting spoke volumes. Beatrice knew, with the certainty of a seasoned housekeeper whoâ€™d seen her fair share of family secrets unfold amidst the dust and grime, that something was about to break.

## Setting:

The Oakhaven Estate is a sprawling, gothic monstrosity nestled amidst the windswept moors of North Yorkshire, England. Built in the late 18th century, it's a testament to the Oakhaven family's wealth and a monument to their crumbling legacy. The exterior is imposing, constructed from dark grey stone and punctuated by numerous turrets, gargoyles, and stained-glass windows that cast eerie shadows throughout the interior.

The inside is a labyrinth of long corridors, dimly lit by flickering gas lamps and populated by antique furniture shrouded in dust sheets. Each room is a repository of Oakhaven history, filled with portraits, busts, and forgotten artifacts. The library, where Beatrice is currently working, is the most grand and arguably the most haunted room in the house. Walls lined with floor-to-ceiling bookshelves stretch as far as the eye can see, holding not just literature, but secrets whispered through generations. A massive fireplace dominates one end of the room, its ornate mantle carved with scenes of historical Oakhaven victories and questionable moral decisions. The air is thick with the scent of old paper, leather, and, of course, Beatrice's ubiquitous lemon polish. Outside the tall, gothic windows, the bleak moorland stretches out, a constant reminder of the isolation and the secrets that Oakhaven Estate so diligently keeps.
