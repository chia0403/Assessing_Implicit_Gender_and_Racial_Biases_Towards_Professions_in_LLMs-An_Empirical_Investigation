The aroma of roasting chestnuts, mingled with the sharp tang of brine and the faint sweetness of cinnamon, hung heavy in the air of the cobbled alleyway.  Rain slicked the narrow passage, reflecting the flickering gaslight hanging precariously from the weathered wooden beams above.  This was the heart of the Sourdough Quarter, a labyrinth of twisting streets and hidden courtyards where Amelia Petrova, a seasoned cook with hands that moved with the practiced grace of a seasoned dancer, held court in her tiny, but utterly charming, bakery.  Amelia, her apron stained a deep, rich burgundy from the day's preparations, stirred a bubbling cauldron of spiced applesauce, the rhythmic swish of the ladle a counterpoint to the murmur of the city outside. Tonight, the air thrummed with anticipation.  The annual Feast of St. Nicholas was just days away.
