The greasy, metallic tang hung heavy in the air of "Rusty Wrench," a small, cluttered garage tucked away on a side street in the grimy industrial heart of the city.  Dust motes danced in the single, flickering fluorescent light above Amelia "Mella"  Kingston's workbench.  Tools, some gleaming, some rusted and chipped, were strewn across the surface like forgotten soldiers. Mella, a woman with hands calloused and strong, knelt beside a sputtering engine, her brow furrowed in concentration.  The engine, a vintage, beat-up Ford V8, coughed and sputtered with an almost pathetic sound.  Outside, the rhythmic clang of delivery trucks and the roar of passing cars seemed to mock the delicate dance of metal and fire happening beneath her skilled fingers. This was Mella's sanctuary, her battlefield, her kingdom â€“ the place where she could coax life from the mechanical carcasses.
