The flickering neon sign of the "Golden Gate Grill" cast a lurid, sickly yellow glow across the rain-slicked streets of New Orleans.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron awning, a relentless percussion that mirrored the chaotic rhythm drumming in Amelia "Emmy" Dubois' head.  She hunched deeper into the booth, the greasy, vinyl seat a familiar comfort amidst the swirling anxieties.  Emmy, a thirty-nine-year-old film director with eyes the colour of storm clouds and a spirit as restless as the Mississippi, stared at the half-eaten gumbo before her.  The scent of paprika and garlic, usually a welcome balm, only intensified the gnawing emptiness in her stomach. Tonight, it felt more like a mocking ghost.

The setting was the French Quarter, New Orleans, Louisiana, a city steeped in history and brimming with a vibrant, almost palpable energy.  The atmosphere, however, felt more fraught than usual.  The usually boisterous sounds of the street, the clinking of glasses and the murmurs of conversation, were muted by the deluge, lending a sense of disquiet to the already humid air.  The Golden Gate Grill, a dimly lit haven for late-night revelers and frustrated artists, was her temporary sanctuary, a haven that felt less safe tonight than any of her films' most harrowing set locations.  The city, usually a canvas for her creative visions, felt tonight like a backdrop about to crumble under the weight of her own anxieties.
