The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine and impending rain.  Dr.  Anya Petrova, a registered dietician with a penchant for crisp linen and meticulous planning, adjusted her glasses, peering through the throng of shoppers at the bustling Bangkok market.  Sunlight, fractured by the leaves of ancient mango trees, dappled the stalls overflowing with exotic fruits – dragon fruit, rambutan, mangoes the colour of melted gold – and vibrant vegetables arranged in intricate patterns.  A symphony of bartering voices, punctuated by the insistent clucking of chickens and the distant wail of a motorbike, swirled around her.  This wasn't the sterile white-walled clinic where Anya meticulously charted macronutrients and meticulously tracked blood sugar levels. This was the heart of a bustling Asian metropolis, a vibrant tapestry of flavours and vibrant life where the concepts of balanced meals often took a backseat to the immediate demands of survival.  Her current assignment: to understand how the local communities navigated the complexities of healthy eating amidst a landscape of cheap, readily available, yet potentially unhealthy, staples.
