Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic rhythm of Amelia Hayes's thoughts.  The small, unassuming physiotherapy practice, nestled on the outskirts of the forgotten town of Oakhaven, was usually a haven of quiet creaks and the soft sighs of recovering patients.  But today, the air thrummed with an anxiety Amelia hadn't felt since her own rehabilitation after the accident.

The setting was the small, isolated town of Oakhaven, nestled in the foothills of the whispering mountains.  Grey skies perpetually draped the town, and the damp earth clung to everything like a shroud.  The clinic, "Oakhaven Rehab," was a single-story building, more a weathered shack than a state-of-the-art facility.  Inside, the muted fluorescent lights cast long shadows over the worn linoleum floor.  The smell of antiseptic mingled with the faint, earthy scent of the surrounding woods.  Outside, the rain continued its relentless assault, a constant reminder of the isolation and the unspoken anxieties that clung to the residents of Oakhaven like the damp fog that often rolled in from the mountains.
