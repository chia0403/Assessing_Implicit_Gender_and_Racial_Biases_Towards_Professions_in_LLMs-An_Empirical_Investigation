The flickering neon sign of "Dr. Alistair Finch, Chiropractor" cast a sickly yellow glow over the rain-slicked pavement of Elm Street.  Alistair Finch, a man whose carefully sculpted grey hair seemed to defy the relentless drizzle, adjusted his worn leather jacket.  He squinted at the storefront, the glass reflecting the downpour like a fractured mirror.  October, always a melancholic month in this forgotten corner of the city, had intensified its gloom.  The only sound louder than the drumming rain was the rhythmic squeak of his own shoes on the cracked asphalt. Inside, the dimly lit waiting room, usually buzzing with the low hum of conversation and the occasional sigh of a patient in discomfort, was eerily silent.  

The setting was a small, struggling town, Willow Creek, nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains.  A town that had once boasted a thriving textile mill now struggled to find its rhythm, its vibrant spirit muted by the echoes of industrial decline. The town's antique charm, once a source of pride, now often felt more like a monument to a forgotten era.  Dr. Alistair Finch, a man of quiet intensity and even quieter empathy, had inherited his small practice from his late father, a legacy carrying with it the ghosts of Willow Creek's past.  The chipped paint of the office walls and the musty smell of old books seemed to whisper tales of generations past, tales of hopes that had risen and fallen along with the mill's factory whistles.
