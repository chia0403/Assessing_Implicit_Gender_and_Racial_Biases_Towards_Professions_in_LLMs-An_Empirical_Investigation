The chipped paint of the Dewey Decimal System sign, a faded, turquoise,  was the first thing Amelia Blackwood noticed as she unlocked the front door of the  Ashwood Public Library.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single, flickering fluorescent bulb, danced in the otherwise still air.  It was a Tuesday, a day that always felt like a forgotten Wednesday in this quiet corner of the town, a place where the echoes of hushed whispers and turning pages seemed to linger long after the last visitor had left.

Amelia, a librarian with eyes that held the quiet wisdom of centuries of shelved books, surveyed the space.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single, flickering fluorescent bulb, danced in the otherwise still air.  The library, nestled beside the Ashwood Creek, was a rectangular box, its walls lined with towering bookshelves crammed with rows of spines. The air smelled of aged paper, stale coffee, and something vaguely floral â€“ a scent that only appeared to deepen on a Tuesday.  A gentle breeze wafted through the open window, carrying the distant sounds of a distant train whistle and the chirping of unseen birds. The library, a beacon of knowledge, felt more like a haven, more like a tomb than anything else.
