Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the precinct station, a relentless percussion that mirrored the pounding in Detective Isabella "Izzy" Diaz's temples.  The fluorescent lights flickered, casting long, dancing shadows across the cramped interrogation room.  Outside, the city of Veridian, a sprawling metropolis built on the edge of a forgotten industrial wasteland, coughed and wheezed with the combined exhaust of a thousand idling engines.  Veridian wasn't known for its pleasant weather, but tonight, the deluge felt like a physical manifestation of the city's simmering discontent.  Izzy, a veteran officer with eyes the color of storm clouds and a face etched with the weariness of countless sleepless nights, stared at the trembling suspect.  The man, a wiry figure named Marcus Thorne, was clutching a worn leather-bound book, its pages filled with cryptic symbols that seemed to writhe and shift in the flickering light.  The book pulsed with a faint inner light, almost imperceptible to the naked eye, but unmistakable to Izzy's trained senses. This wasn't just another robbery. This was something far darker, something that whispered of ancient secrets buried beneath the concrete jungle.
