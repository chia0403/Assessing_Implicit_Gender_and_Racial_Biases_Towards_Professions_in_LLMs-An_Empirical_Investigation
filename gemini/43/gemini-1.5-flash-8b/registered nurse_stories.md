Rain lashed against the arched windows of the St. Jude's Emergency Room, mimicking the frantic rhythm of Amelia Hayes's own heart.  The fluorescent lights hummed, a stark counterpoint to the cacophony of beeping monitors and the hushed, urgent whispers of her colleagues.  The air, thick with the metallic tang of blood and the antiseptic smell of disinfectant, hung heavy, mirroring the oppressive weight settling on Amelia's chest.  Outside, the city, usually a vibrant tapestry of lights and motion, was swallowed by the storm, its frantic energy condensed into this small, brightly lit room.  Amelia, a registered nurse with five years' experience at St. Jude's, felt the familiar knot tightening in her stomach.  Tonight, the patients were particularly harrowing, the stories whispered in their breaths echoing the relentless hammering of the rain.
