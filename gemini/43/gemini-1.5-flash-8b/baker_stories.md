The scent of yeast and cinnamon hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Elias Thorne, the Morning Glory Baker.  He kneaded the dough with practiced hands, the rhythmic thudding a counterpoint to the soft clinking of chipped porcelain in the adjacent display case.  Sunlight, filtered through the dusty, floral-patterned curtains, cast long shadows across the tiny bakery, illuminating the intricate swirls of icing on the elaborate tiered cake destined for the annual Harvest Festival.  Outside, the cobblestones of the Old Quarter echoed with the cheerful clatter of carts and the low murmur of conversations.  This was Elias's haven, a sanctuary from the harsh realities of a world teetering on the brink of something...unknown.  His small, unassuming bakery, tucked away on a side street, was more than just a place to bake bread; it was a refuge, a promise of order amidst the growing chaos.
