The fluorescent lights of the "Tax Time Express" hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia Butterfield's life.  Amelia, a meticulous income tax preparer with a penchant for sharp pencils and perfectly organized folders, stared at the spreadsheet sprawled across her desk.  Rows upon rows of numbers – incomes, deductions, credits – danced before her eyes, a kaleidoscope of financial data that, to her, represented stories of lives lived, successes celebrated, and sacrifices made.  Her tiny, cluttered office, located in a nondescript strip mall on the outskirts of Oakhaven, smelled faintly of stale coffee and desperation.  Outside, the crisp autumn air whipped through the bare branches of the maple trees, mirroring the anxieties swirling within the tax forms before her. This was the day before the official start of the tax season, and the phone was already ringing, a prelude to the relentless barrage of questions, worries, and hopes that would engulf her for the next three months.  Amelia knew the rhythm, the frantic tempo of tax season. She welcomed it in a way. In this cacophony of numbers and worries, she found a peculiar sort of peace.
