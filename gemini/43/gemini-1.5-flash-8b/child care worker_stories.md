The fluorescent lights of the "Rainbow Buddies" preschool hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to the cacophony of squawks, giggles, and the rhythmic thump-thump of tiny feet echoing off the brightly coloured walls.  Amelia Butterfield, a young woman with perpetually tired eyes and a smile that tried, valiantly, to stay bright, surveyed the scene.  A flurry of vibrant, crayon-stained hands clawed at the playdough, a chorus of "Mine!" punctuated by the insistent, "No, it's mine!" of a smaller child, and the rhythmic shushing of Amelia’s voice, attempting to guide the escalating drama.  It was Tuesday morning, and the usual Tuesday chaos was well under way.

Amelia, 23, worked at the cheerful but somewhat chaotic Rainbow Buddies preschool, nestled in a small, quiet cul-de-sac in the suburb of Oakhaven.  The houses were modest, brick and beige, a stark contrast to the rainbow-hued dreams projected by the pastel-coloured walls of the preschool.  A gentle breeze rustled the leaves of the ancient oak tree in the small front yard, a sentinel of calm amidst the daily eruption of toddlers.  Amelia knew the rustling of the leaves, the gentle creaks of the old house next door, and the quiet murmur of conversations drifting from nearby windows.  But today, something felt…off. The air, usually thick with the scent of freshly-baked muffins and playdough, held a strange, almost metallic tang.
