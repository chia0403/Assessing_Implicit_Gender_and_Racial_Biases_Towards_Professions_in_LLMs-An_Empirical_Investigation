The biting November wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's trench coat around her legs as she hurried down the cobbled alleyway.  Rain, a relentless, icy curtain, plastered the narrow streets to a slick, unforgiving surface.  Gutter water, collected in overflowing drains, smelled faintly of mildew and something else, something vaguely metallic.  The air itself felt thick with the oppressive weight of unspoken anxieties, a feeling Amelia, an insurance agent for the perpetually floundering "Prudential Protectorate," knew all too well.  She adjusted her spectacles, the tiny lenses reflecting the flickering neon signs of the surrounding buildings â€“ a kaleidoscope of garish colours struggling to pierce the gloom.

This was the heart of the city's underbelly, the district known as the "Forgotten Quarter," a labyrinthine network of narrow lanes and towering, decaying apartment blocks.  Tenants in these run-down buildings, many immigrants struggling to make ends meet, often had little more than the bare essentials.  A precarious existence made even more precarious by the ceaseless churn of life in this city, where fortunes could change in an instant, and the weight of the past often threatened to crush the future.  Amelia, with her meticulously organized files and unwavering determination, was a small beacon of order in this chaotic landscape, a shield against the storms threatening to engulf the lives she insured.
