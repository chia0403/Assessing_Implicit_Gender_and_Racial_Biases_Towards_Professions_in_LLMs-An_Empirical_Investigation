The chipped porcelain sink, perpetually stained a muted rose, reflected the fluorescent hum of the salon.  Sunlight, filtered through the grime-coated window panes, painted fractured patterns across the tiled floor.  This was Anya Petrova's sanctuary, a tiny haven crammed with the scent of nail polish and the rhythmic click-clack of tiny metal files.  Anya, a manicurist with eyes the colour of warm honey and hands as swift as a hummingbird's wings, meticulously sculpted a delicate French manicure, the clientâ€™s quiet sighs a comforting counterpoint to the whirring of the air conditioner.  Today, the client was a woman named Mrs. Dubois, whose anxieties seemed to seep into the air around her, mirrored in the nervous twitches of her fingers.  Anya, for all her practiced calm, felt a familiar tremor in her own hands.  Something was different today.  This feeling wasn't the usual pre-appointment jitters; it was an almost physical weight pressing down on her. The air thrummed with a strange energy, a low, almost imperceptible hum that resonated deep within the salon, a hum that Anya knew she couldn't ignore.
