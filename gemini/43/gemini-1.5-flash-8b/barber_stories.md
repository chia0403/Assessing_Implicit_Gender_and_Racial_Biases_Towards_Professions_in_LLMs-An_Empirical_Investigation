The chipped paint on the "Barbers' Quarters" sign, a faded, emerald green, seemed to mock the rain lashing against the corrugated iron roof.  Inside, bathed in the hazy glow of a single, flickering bulb,  Barnaby "Barbs" Butterfield, a man whose beard, thick and the color of burnt umber, almost hid his face, expertly snipped at a particularly unruly mop of dark brown hair.  The scent of sandalwood and old, well-worn leather filled the small, cluttered shop.  Cobwebs, thin and silvery, hung like delicate lace from the rafters, creating a shadowy backdrop to the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of the clippers.  A half-eaten bowl of lukewarm custard, the remnants of a forgotten breakfast, sat abandoned on a cluttered counter.

The setting was the dusty, rain-swept town of Willow Creek, nestled in the foothills of the Whispering Mountains.  Willow Creek, a town steeped in the whispers of generations past and clinging desperately to a fading glory, was a place where time seemed to slow down and linger like mist in the valleys.  The only vibrant color was provided by the patchwork of vibrant wildflowers blooming sporadically amongst the skeletal remains of abandoned farmsteads.  The air hung heavy with the scent of pine and damp earth, and the occasional howl of a lone coyote echoed through the valleys. Barnaby had worked in his father's shop, "Barnaby's Barbershop" for twenty years and knew every twist and turn of this place, from the path behind the blacksmith's forge to the abandoned church spire where the ravens nested.
