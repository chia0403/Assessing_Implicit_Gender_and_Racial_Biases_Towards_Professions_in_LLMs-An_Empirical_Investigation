The chill of the November air, sharp and biting, sliced through Bartholomew "Barty"  Featherstonehaugh's worn leather apron as he stepped out of the shadowed doorway of "Featherstone's Finest Cuts."  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of lamplight illuminating the cobbled street, momentarily highlighting the glistening crimson of the freshly-slaughtered lamb hanging from a nearby stall.  The aroma of roasting chestnuts and sizzling sausages mingled with the pungent, almost medicinal, scent of blood and brine that clung to the air of this section of Old Southwark.  Barty, with his prematurely grey, unruly hair, and hands calloused but surprisingly gentle, adjusted the thick woolen scarf around his neck.  Another night, another harvest of meat to prepare for the hungry mouths of the city.  This one, though, felt different.  A prickle of unease, like a sliver of ice lodged in his throat, accompanied the usual dampness of the season.

Old Southwark, 1688.  The city, though burgeoning, held a palpable tension.  Whispers circulated about strange sickness plaguing the docks, rumors of unrest among the newly arrived immigrants, and murmurs of discontent from the burgeoning working class.  Gaslight flickered erratically from precarious lampposts, casting long, dancing shadows across the narrow alleyways and shadowed taverns. The meat market, a bustling hive of activity during the day, now breathed with a silent, almost expectant hush.  A damp fog clung to the riverbank, obscuring the water and shrouding the city in a humid, oppressive veil.  Barty knew this dampness, this stillness, as a prelude to something more.  Tonight, the air hummed with an almost palpable energy, a palpable tension that hinted at something more sinister than the usual grime and poverty of the city.
