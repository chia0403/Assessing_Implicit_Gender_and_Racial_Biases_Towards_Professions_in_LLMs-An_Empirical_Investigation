The aroma of cinnamon and buttercream hung heavy in the air, clinging to the chipped paint of the bakery's walls and swirling around Amelia "Amy" Butterfield as she painstakingly piped a delicate rose onto a miniature wedding cake.  Sunlight, filtered through the grimy windowpanes, illuminated dust motes dancing in the air, casting long shadows across the cluttered work surface.  Tiny porcelain figurines, remnants of past creations, lined the counter, silent witnesses to countless triumphs and near-disasters.  Amy, twenty-eight, was nestled in her small corner of "Sugarplum Confections," a bakery tucked away on a side street in the bustling, rain-slicked city of Aethelgard.  The rhythmic clatter of the espresso machine and the occasional hushed murmur of customers drifted in from the main area, but Amy was completely absorbed in her craft, a world of sugar and frosting entirely her own.
