The fluorescent lights of Dr. Anya Sharma's office hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the rhythmic clinking of instruments and the low murmur of conversations.  Anya Sharma, a dental hygienist with a smile as bright as the polished porcelain she often worked with, meticulously polished a patient's teeth.  The scent of mint and antiseptic hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort mixed with the subtle, metallic tang of fear that sometimes clung to the space.  Her gloved hands moved with practiced precision, a soothing counterpoint to the anxious breaths she could sometimes hear through the thin partition separating her from the waiting room.  Today, however, the air felt unusually thick, almost stagnant.  It was a Tuesday in late October, the kind of day that felt like the crisp, cool air was trying to hold onto summer's last breaths.  Outside, the leaves on the ancient oaks bordering the clinic had begun their descent, swirling in fiery hues of orange and gold, a stark contrast to the sterile white of the building itself.  The rhythmic tapping of her instruments and the low hum of the equipment seemed to amplify the stillness, a hush before the storm.
