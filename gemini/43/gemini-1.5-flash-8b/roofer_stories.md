The wind howled a mournful dirge, a symphony of icy shrieks that clawed at the corrugated iron of Elias Thorne’s workshop.  Dust devils danced across the deserted lot, swirling remnants of the previous day's rain into a gritty, grey haze.  Elias Thorne, a roofer with calloused hands and eyes the colour of stormy seas, crouched beneath the skeletal frame of a half-constructed house.  He adjusted the worn leather straps of his tool belt, the familiar weight a comfort in the biting chill. The skeletal frame of the house, a half-finished husk against the darkening sky, stood as a monument to the slow, agonizing pace of construction during the winter's grip on the town of Alderwood.

The setting: Alderwood, a small, isolated town nestled in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains.  Snow clung stubbornly to the peaks, its frosty breath hanging heavy in the valleys.  The town itself was a patchwork of decaying Victorian houses, their once-proud facades now weathered and worn, and struggling against the relentless march of the elements.  Skyscrapers, tall and imposing symbols of other, more prosperous regions, seemed impossibly distant.  Winter’s icy fingers held Alderwood in a silent, suffocating embrace.
