The humid air hung heavy over the Grand Victorian Hotel, clinging to the polished mahogany floors and the crisp linen sheets of room 217.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun filtering through the ornate stained-glass window depicting a mythical stag.  Outside, the cacophony of the bustling city – the clatter of horse-drawn carriages, the cries of street vendors, the distant rumble of industry – faded into a muted hum through the thick, double-paned windows.  This was the realm of Bartholomew "Barty" Finch, bellhop extraordinaire (though he preferred the title, "facilitator of guest experience") of the esteemed Grand Victorian.  Barty, a young man with eyes that held the wistful gleam of a dreamer perpetually caught between the grandeur of his surroundings and the quiet desperation of his own aspirations, adjusted his crisp, starched uniform.  The perfectly polished brass tip of his hat shone faintly against the backdrop of the opulent hotel lobby.  Another guest, a woman draped in a magnificent emerald gown, was waiting for her luggage.  Barty felt a familiar thrumming in his chest.  His latest assignment loomed.  This wasn't just another piece of luggage.  This case held something more... something potentially, *everything*.
