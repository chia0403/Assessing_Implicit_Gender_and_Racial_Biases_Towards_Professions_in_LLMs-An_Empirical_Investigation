The chipped paint of the "Rosie's Roadrunner" gleamed under the harsh desert sun, reflecting the heat haze shimmering over the cracked asphalt.

He was on the last leg of his route, a solitary pilgrimage across the arid expanse of the American Southwest. Tonight, his destination was the forgotten ghost town of Harmony, a town rumored to hold secrets older than the desert itself.
