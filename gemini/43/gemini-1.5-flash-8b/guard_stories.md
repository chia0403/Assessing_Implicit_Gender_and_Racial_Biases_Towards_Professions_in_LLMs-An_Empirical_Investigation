The biting wind howled a mournful dirge through the jagged peaks of the Silverfang Mountains, whipping snow into stinging, icy shards that stung Sergeant Kael Theron's cheeks.  His breath puffed out in white clouds that dissipated instantly in the frigid air.  Above, the pale, almost ethereal glow of the Northern Lights painted fleeting patterns across the bruised twilight sky.  Below, the skeletal remains of a long-abandoned trading post, its timbers blackened and scarred, clung precariously to the mountainside.  This was the Whispering Pass, a notorious stretch of the Iron Crown Trail, and Sergeant Theron was alone, his only company the relentless wind and the ghosts of the past.  The flickering oil lamp in the dilapidated guardhouse cast long, dancing shadows that seemed to mock his isolation.  His duty, as always, was unwavering: to protect the Pass, and the meager travelers who dared to traverse it in the dead of winter.
