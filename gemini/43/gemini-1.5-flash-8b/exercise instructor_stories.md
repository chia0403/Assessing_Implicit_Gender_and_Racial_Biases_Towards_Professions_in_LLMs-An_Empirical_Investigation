The fluorescent lights of the "Ironclad Fitness" gym buzzed, a relentless hum that seemed to vibrate through Amelia "Hammer" Hernandez's very bones.  Sweat beaded on her brow, mirroring the glistening sheen on the polished chrome dumbbells lining the walls.  Her signature ponytail, usually a tightly wound knot of midnight black, was now a tangled, damp mess that clung to the back of her neck.  Around her, a chorus of grunts, sighs, and the rhythmic thump of pounding feet filled the air. This was Amelia’s sanctuary, her battlefield, and tonight, victory belonged to the warriors within her class – the ones pushing their limits to the breaking point.  The setting was a sprawling, warehouse-like space, the concrete floor polished to a high sheen and faintly smelling of ozone and old gym equipment.  Stark white walls punctuated by motivational posters and strategically placed mirrors reflected the determined figures working through their routines.  The aroma of protein shakes hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint scent of chlorine. It was 9:30 pm, and the late-night Sweat Squad was in full swing.
