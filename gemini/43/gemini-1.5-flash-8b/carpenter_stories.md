The biting wind, a relentless, clawing beast, whipped around Elias Thorne, rattling the loose shingles on the ramshackle workshop.  Dust motes, kicked up from the cobblestone street, danced in the pale winter light filtering through the grime-streaked window panes.  Elias, his face a roadmap of frostbite and weariness, hunched over a workbench groaning under the weight of half-finished furniture.  He was Elias Thorne, carpenter of Copperbottom Alley, a man whose hands, though calloused and scarred, held a certain quiet grace, a testament to years spent coaxing life from the stubborn heart of wood.  The air, thick with the smell of sawdust and pine, was punctuated by the rhythmic clang of his hammer, a lonely counterpoint to the howling wind.  Outside, the skeletal branches of the ancient oak, the alley's only significant landmark, clawed at the sky like skeletal fingers, a stark reminder of the bleak beauty of the season.  Within the workshop, though, the glow of the flickering hearth painted a fragile warmth, a tiny, beating heart in the face of the approaching winter's wrath.
