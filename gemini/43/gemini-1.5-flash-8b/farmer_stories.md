The biting wind whipped across the parched fields of the Blackwood Valley, carrying with it the scent of dry earth and the mournful cry of a lone raven.  Dust devils danced across the cracked furrows, mocking the weary figure of Silas Blackwood, a farmer whose name, once a beacon of pride in this forgotten corner of the world, now echoed with the hollow emptiness of failing harvests.  His weathered hands, calloused and scarred from a lifetime of toil, gripped the worn leather reins of his mule, Bess.  The valley, once a vibrant tapestry of emerald green, was now a muted palette of grey and brown, a stark testament to the unrelenting drought that had gripped the land for three long seasons.  Silas, his eyes the colour of faded embers, stared out at the desolate landscape, a quiet despair settling in his heart.  He was Silas Blackwood, the last of his line, keeper of the Blackwood farm, and he felt the weight of the future, a bleak and uncertain future, settling heavily on his shoulders.
