The flickering neon sign of "Ace Plumbing" cast a sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked cobblestones of Market Square.  Rain lashed against the corrugated iron awning, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic rhythm in Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's chest.  He wasn't just dealing with a leaky faucet; he was dealing with a deluge.  A particularly stubborn one, bubbling up from the very foundations of the historic, if somewhat dilapidated, Copper Kettle Inn.  The inn, a landmark in the quaint, fog-shrouded town of Oakhaven, had been a favourite of Barty's since he was a boy, and now, its very heart seemed to be threatening to unravel.

Barty, a wiry man with eyes that seemed to pierce the gloom, tugged at his soaked overalls.  The smell of mildew and something faintly metallic clung to the air, a scent that rarely failed to prickle Barty's nose and conjure the ghosts of forgotten plumbing nightmares.  He checked his battered toolbox, a collection of wrenches, screwdrivers, and pipe cleaners that spoke volumes about his years of experienceâ€”years spent wrestling with Oakhaven's notoriously capricious water system.  Tonight, though, the fight felt different, more personal.  This wasn't just a plumbing emergency; it was a test.  A test of his skill, his resolve, and perhaps, even his loyalty to a town he loved.
