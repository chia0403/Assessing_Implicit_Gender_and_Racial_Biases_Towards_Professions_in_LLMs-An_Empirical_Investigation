The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks.  The air, thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, hung heavy in the crisp autumnal air.

Her breath puffed out in white clouds against the perpetually overcast sky.

Her tour was about more than just the history of the haunted forest, it was about unlocking the stories that whispered through the trees.
