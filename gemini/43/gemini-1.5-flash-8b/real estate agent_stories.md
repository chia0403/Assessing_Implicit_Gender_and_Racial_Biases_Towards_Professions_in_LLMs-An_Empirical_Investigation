The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Sterling's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks as she hurried down the cobblestone street of  Old Town Charleston.  The air, thick with the aroma of salt air and simmering spices from the nearby restaurants, offered little comfort against the chill.  Her worn leather boots crunched on the gravel, each step a measured beat against the rhythmic creak of the ancient, wooden houses lining the narrow lanes.  Amy, a seasoned real estate agent with a reputation for turning fixer-uppers into dream homes, had a particularly challenging assignment today.

The setting:  A charming, yet crumbling, 18th-century plantation house nestled amongst sprawling oaks and overgrown gardens.  Its history, as palpable as the ghostly scent of magnolia clinging to the air, whispered tales of fortunes made and lost, whispered promises and broken vows.  Amy knew the property, or at least its current derelict state, well.  Locals called it "The Raven's Roost," a moniker fueled by the pervasive darkness that seemed to cling to the structure, a darkness that seemed to contradict the beauty of the surrounding landscape. This was no ordinary listing. This property held a weight, an unspoken story, and Amy, with her keen eye for detail and a stubborn streak that rivaled the resilience of the old house itself, was determined to unlock its secrets.
