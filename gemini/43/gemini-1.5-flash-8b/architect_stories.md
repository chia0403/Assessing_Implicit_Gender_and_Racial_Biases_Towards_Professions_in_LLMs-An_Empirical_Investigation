Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the workshop, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic rhythm of Amelia Blackwood's thoughts.  The air hung thick with the scent of damp plaster and linseed oil, a familiar symphony of the architectural studio she'd inherited from her grandfather, a symphony now more akin to a dirge.  Amelia, a rising star in the city's architectural circles,  was trapped in a maelstrom of her own making.  Her grandfather's legacy, the renowned Blackwood Designs, had once been synonymous with elegant, innovative structures. Now, it teetered on the brink of collapse.  The proposed "Symphony of Steel" – a towering, ambitious skyscraper planned for the city's central plaza – was proving more problematic than any blueprint she'd ever encountered.  

The workshop, tucked away behind a crumbling Victorian townhouse on the rain-slicked streets of Newhaven, was a labyrinth of blueprints, sketches, and half-finished models.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom, illuminating the intricate latticework of a proposed bridge structure.  Amelia, her dark hair plastered to her forehead, hunched over a mahogany table, tracing the lines of a complex structural diagram with a charcoal pencil.  The city lights glimmered through the grime-streaked windows, casting a muted glow across the room, a stark contrast to the turmoil swirling inside her.
