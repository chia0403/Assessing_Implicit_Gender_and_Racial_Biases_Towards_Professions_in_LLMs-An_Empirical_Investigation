The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow on Amelia Blackwood's face, highlighting the faint circles under her eyes.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic rhythm of her heart.  The cramped, smoky interior smelled of stale coffee, burnt sugar, and desperation.

Amelia, a server with an almost unnervingly calm demeanor, was already halfway through her sixth round of refills for a table in the far corner.  The patrons, a motley crew of weary travelers and forgotten souls, seemed to absorb the bar's gloom as easily as the cheap whiskey they consumed. Tonight, however, felt different.  A strange, almost palpable tension hung in the air, thick as the cigarette smoke that swirled around her.  And Amelia, despite her placid exterior, felt a prickle of unease crawl up her spine.
