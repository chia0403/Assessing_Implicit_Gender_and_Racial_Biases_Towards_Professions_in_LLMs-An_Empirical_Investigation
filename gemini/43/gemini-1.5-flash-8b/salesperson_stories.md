The fluorescent lights of the "Bargain Bin Blitz" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia “Amy” Cartwright’s relentless pursuit of the perfect sale.

Amy, a whirlwind of nervous energy in a faded floral blouse and perpetually smudged eyeliner, paced the aisles, her eyes scanning the rows of discounted merchandise.  Today was "Deep Discount Day," a day the Bargain Bin Blitz reserved for their truly exceptional (or, more likely, deeply flawed) inventory.  Amy, with her uncanny ability to sniff out a profit, was determined to make it pay off.
