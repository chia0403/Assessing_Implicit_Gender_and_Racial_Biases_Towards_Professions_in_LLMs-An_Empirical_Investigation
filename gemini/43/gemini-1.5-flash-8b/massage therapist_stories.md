The aroma of lavender and sandalwood hung thick in the air, a comforting blanket draped over the hushed space of "Serenity Springs."  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a rhythmic counterpoint to the soft, rhythmic kneading Amelia Nightingale felt beneath her hands.  Her client, a woman named Eleanor Vance, sighed deeply, her shoulders relaxing with each slow, deliberate stroke of Amelia's fingers.  The rhythmic drumming of the rain and the soft purr of the massage table were the only sounds accompanying the low hum of Amelia's concentration.

The small, unassuming clinic sat tucked away on the outskirts of the town of Oakhaven, nestled between a dilapidated bakery and a sprawling, overgrown vegetable patch.  Victorian-era architecture clung precariously to the edges of the surrounding wilderness, their once-proud facades now marred by ivy and time.  A worn, hand-painted sign hung crookedly above the door, proclaiming "Serenity Springs: Where tensions release and the soul finds peace."  The flickering gaslight outside cast long, dancing shadows across the damp pavement, emphasizing the secluded nature of the place.  Inside, despite the relentless rain, a sense of calm persisted, a refuge from the chaos of the outside world.
