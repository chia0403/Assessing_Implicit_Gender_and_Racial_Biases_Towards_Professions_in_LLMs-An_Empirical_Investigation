The biting wind whipped Amelia Hawthorne's coat around her legs as she stared out at the sprawling expanse of the Scottish Highlands.  Loch Ness, a dark, brooding mirror reflecting the bruised purple sky, stretched before her, its waters seemingly holding the secrets of a thousand ages.  The air, thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, carried the mournful cry of a curlew.  Amelia, DVM, hunched deeper into her worn, waterproof jacket, the chill seeping into her bones.  She was alone, save for the rustling of the ancient trees surrounding the secluded veterinary clinic nestled into the side of a glen, a place where time seemed to slow and nature's rhythms dictated the days.  Her tiny practice, "Glencoe Equine and Wildlife," was a testament to her stubborn refusal to leave the rugged beauty of the Highlands, a place where she'd found a sanctuary amongst the wild creatures and fierce landscapes.  The clinic, a converted stone shepherd's hut, offered little in the way of modern comforts, but it housed a warm hearth, a loyal dog named Skye, and a profound connection to the animals that populated these whispering hills.  The crisp autumn air held the promise of a long, challenging winter, and with it, the possibility of a case that would test her skills and her resolve.
