Dust motes danced in the pale glow, swirling around Bartholomew "Barty"  Featherstonehaugh's nimble fingers as he meticulously pinned a crimson velvet lining to a waistcoat.  His workshop, tucked away on a narrow alleyway in the heart of the burgeoning industrial city of Aethelgard, was a symphony of hushed whispers and the rhythmic snip of shears.  The air, thick with the scent of beeswax, wool, and something indefinably floral – perhaps a stray blossom from the nearby market garden – hung heavy with the weight of a hundred unspoken stories.  Barty, a tailor of exceptional skill and a quiet, contemplative nature, was currently embroiled in the creation of a particularly intricate commission: a waistcoat for Lord Ashworth, a nobleman known for his demanding tastes and even more demanding reputation.  The city itself buzzed with the clang of machinery, the murmur of crowds, and the relentless rhythm of progress, all of which seemed to fade to a low hum as Barty focused on the delicate task before him.
