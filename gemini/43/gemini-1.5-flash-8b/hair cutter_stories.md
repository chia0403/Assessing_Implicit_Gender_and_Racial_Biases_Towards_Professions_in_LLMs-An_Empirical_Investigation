The chipped porcelain sink of "Scissors & Smiles" gleamed under the harsh fluorescent lights, reflecting the frantic movements of Amelia Kensington.  Her fingers, nimble despite the tremor in her hands, sliced through a thick strand of auburn hair, sending it cascading into the overflowing basin.  The salon, a tiny space crammed with mismatched chairs and faded floral wallpaper, smelled faintly of antiseptic and stale coffee.  Sunlight, weak and filtered through the grimy window, cast long shadows across the dusty shelves lined with hair products, their labels peeling and faded. Amelia, a whirlwind of grey-flecked black hair and perpetually furrowed brow, was a whirlwind of focused energy. Today, more than most, she was a tempest, a storm brewing within her tiny kingdom of clipped ends and styled dreams.

The calendar on the wall, its plastic surface cracked, marked the 27th of September.  A single, wilting daisy, a gift from a client, lay forlornly beside a stack of unpaid bills. Outside, the city roared—a symphony of car horns and hurried footsteps – a constant hum that seemed to echo the relentless pulse of Amelia’s own thoughts.  This September, the rhythm was different.  The usual rush of clients, the gossip of neighbors, the predictable hum of the salon – all felt...wrong.  Something was missing.  The air hung heavy, thick with an unspoken anxiety, even in the normally boisterous space. And Amelia, usually unfazed by the daily grind, felt it deeply.
