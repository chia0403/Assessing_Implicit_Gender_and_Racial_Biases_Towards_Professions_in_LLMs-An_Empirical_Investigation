The fluorescent lights of the "Corner Grocer" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Blackwood's fifth hour of scanning groceries.  Rain hammered against the corrugated metal roof, mimicking the rhythmic thump of her pulse against her ribs.  The small, bustling shop, crammed with overflowing shelves and the aroma of stale bread and ripe tomatoes, was her sanctuary â€“ and her prison.

Amelia, a young woman with eyes the colour of storm clouds and a perpetually tired smile, expertly swiped a carton of eggs. The scanner beeped, confirming the price.  A chipped mug sat precariously on the counter, its handle threatening to spill a lukewarm cup of instant coffee onto the already-stained linoleum.  A single, wilted sunflower sat in a vase on the corner of the counter, a stark contrast to the vibrant hues of the colourful produce piled high around it.  Outside, the grey sky reflected the dullness of the day, and mirrored the heavy weight in Amelia's chest.  The rhythmic ringing of the cash register felt like a mocking reminder of the unyielding monotony of her life.
