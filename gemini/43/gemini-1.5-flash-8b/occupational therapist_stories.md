The fluorescent hum of the therapy room was a constant, almost comforting drone, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* of Amelia Hayes’s own heart.  Amelia, Occupational Therapist, stared at the intricate tangle of colourful threads draped over the patient’s lap.  It wasn't just a craft project, though the brightly dyed yarn did promise a calming effect. This was a meticulously planned exercise, a carefully constructed bridge between frustration and focus, between the fractured present and a potential future where fine motor skills could translate into something more meaningful.

The room itself was small, a sterile box of beige walls and slightly worn, polished wood floors.  Sunlight, pale and filtered through a grimy window, cast long shadows across the space.  A stack of overflowing files, each labelled with a patient’s name and condition, sat precariously on a side table.  The faint scent of antiseptic lingered in the air, a subtle reminder of the fragility of the human body, and the pervasive nature of its limitations.  Outside, the bustling city of New Orleans thrummed with a life that, for now, felt both distant and utterly overwhelming.  Amelia, however, was committed to the space, the routines, the small victories within the sterile walls of this occupational therapy clinic.
