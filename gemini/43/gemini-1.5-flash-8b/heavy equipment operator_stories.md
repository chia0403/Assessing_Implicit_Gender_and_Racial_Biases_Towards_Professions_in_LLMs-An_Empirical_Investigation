The biting wind whipped across the desolate expanse of the Colorado plateau, stinging Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's cheeks.  Dust devils, swirling like miniature tornadoes, danced across the cracked earth, kicking up plumes of ochre that obscured the already low-hanging sun.  Amy, her face grimy with a mix of diesel and sweat, gripped the oversized steering wheel of the Caterpillar D9.  The machine, a hulking behemoth of steel and hydraulics, rumbled beneath her, a rhythmic pulse against the oppressive silence.  Around her, the vast, empty landscape stretched out in endless shades of brown and gray.  Scattered scrub brush, gaunt and skeletal, offered little respite from the unforgiving sun.  This was the remote, unforgiving heartland of the Colorado Plateau, a region where time seemed to slow and the only sounds were the groaning of the earth and the rhythmic clack of Amy's own heavy boots on the metal tread plates.  She was alone, miles from any sign of civilization, buried in a sea of sand and rock, her only companions the whispering wind and the relentless rhythms of the earth-moving beast beneath her.
