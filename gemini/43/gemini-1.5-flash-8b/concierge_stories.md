The rain hammered against the arched glass roof of the Grand Zenith Hotel, a symphony of muted thunder and a relentless drumming that seemed to vibrate through the very bones of Amelia Petrova.  From her perch behind the polished mahogany desk in the opulent lobby, Amelia, the hotel's concierge, could almost taste the impending deluge.  It was a Tuesday in late October, a day as grey and damp as the sprawling city outside, a city that seemed to mirror the stormy sky in its endless hustle and bustle.  The scent of aged leather and polished wood, usually a comforting aroma in the Grand Zenith, was almost swallowed by the earthy smell of the approaching autumn.

The Grand Zenith, nestled amidst towering skyscrapers and whispering boulevards, was a monument to understated luxury.  Its grand fa√ßade, etched with intricate carvings and glistening with a faint golden hue, had been a landmark for generations.  Inside, high ceilings and plush carpets veiled a world of discreet elegance, a world Amelia, at 29, had expertly navigated for the past five years.  But tonight, even her practiced composure felt fragile as the clock on the grandfather clock ticked away the minutes.  The rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the rain seemed to mirror the frantic beat of her own heart.
