The chipped porcelain sink, stained a dull, milky yellow from years of forgotten lemon peels and spilled tea, reflected Amelia Hawthorne’s weary face.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single, flickering fluorescent light above, danced in the air, mirroring the frantic rhythm of her thoughts.  It was the 14th of the month again, the day the Blackwood family descended upon their magnificent, yet menacingly silent, estate, "Whisperwind Manor,"  for their annual, rigidly scheduled, inspection.  Amelia, Whisperwind's eternally undervalued housekeeper, knew the routine like the back of her hand – dust every antique, polish every brass knob, arrange every meticulously positioned vase of dried wildflowers.  She just wished this particular inspection wouldn't be so… intense.  The Blackwoods were notorious for their exacting standards, their unspoken criticisms, and their glacial disapproval, a fact that pressed down on her shoulders heavier than any dusting cloth.

The manor itself, Whisperwind Manor, loomed imposingly against the grey November sky.  Jagged peaks of slate grey roofs pierced the overcast, a stark counterpoint to the deep, dark green of the surrounding forest.  Twisted, ancient trees clawed at the sky, their skeletal branches reaching out like gnarled fingers. The grand entrance hall, usually bathed in the warm glow of dozens of strategically placed lamps, was currently shrouded in a profound, oppressive darkness.  This was the Blackwood's way.  An understated menace.  A deliberate silence. Amelia could practically hear the unspoken expectations thrumming in the walls themselves.
