The flickering neon sign of the "Cosmic Cones" ice cream parlour cast an eerie, violet glow across the alleyway, painting Elias Thorne's grease-stained overalls in a ghostly hue.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of streetlight piercing the grime-coated corrugated iron walls.  This was Elias's domain, his sanctuary, and his workshop â€“ a cramped, forgotten space beneath a dilapidated apartment block in the heart of Neo-Kyoto.  Boxes overflowing with salvaged electronics, tangled wires, and half-eaten ramen containers littered the floor.  Elias, a radio technician with calloused hands and eyes that held the wisdom of countless circuits, hunched over a battered, antique radio receiver, its walnut wood worn smooth by countless repairs.  The rhythmic ticking of a grandfather clock from a nearby apartment seemed to mock the silence of the alley, a persistent counterpoint to the low hum of electricity pulsing through the components before him.  Rain hammered against the corrugated metal roof, a steady, insistent percussion that underscored the growing tension in Elias's shoulders.  Tonight's transmission was critical.
