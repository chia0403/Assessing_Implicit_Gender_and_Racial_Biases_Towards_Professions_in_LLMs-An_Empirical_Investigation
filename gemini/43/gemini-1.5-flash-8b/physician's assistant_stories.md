The setting: a dilapidated clinic on the edge of a rapidly expanding, poverty-stricken neighborhood in the sprawling metropolis of Meridian.  Rust-colored dust motes danced in the single, flickering fluorescent light, casting long, skeletal shadows.  The smell of unwashed bodies and uncooked food hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the sterile sterility Amelia usually worked in.  The young woman, trembling, whispered a name:  "Elias."
