The fluorescent hum of the server room was a constant, almost imperceptible lullaby to Alistair Finch, Systems Analyst extraordinaire.  He was, more accurately, a Systems Analyst *extraordinaire* in the peculiar, quiet sense of a person who felt truly at home amidst the whirring machinery and blinking lights.  His office, or rather, his workstation, sat nestled in the heart of the sprawling data center, a labyrinth of interconnected cables and shimmering server racks.  Rows upon rows of humming metal giants, each containing a world of information, seemed to breathe with a digital rhythm.  Alistair, clad in a slightly-too-large grey hoodie and perpetually-stained jeans, meticulously checked a series of complex algorithms on the large monitor in front of him.  Outside, the city pulsed with life, a cacophony of sirens and honking taxis, a world entirely disconnected from the meticulously ordered, binary world Alistair inhabited. Tonight, however, the quiet hum of the server room felt different.  A subtle glitch in the network, a rogue packet flitting erratically through the digital ether, had alerted his finely tuned analytical senses.  Something was amiss.  It feltâ€¦wrong.
