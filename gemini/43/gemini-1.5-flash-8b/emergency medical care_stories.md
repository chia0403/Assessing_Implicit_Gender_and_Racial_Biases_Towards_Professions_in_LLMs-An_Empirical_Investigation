St. Croix, a city steeped in history and shadowed by the perpetual threat of the encroaching sea, was draped in a grey shroud.  The scent of brine, mingled with the acrid tang of something burnt, hung heavy in the air.  Amy, a paramedic for the St. Croix Metropolitan Emergency Response Unit, pressed her gloved fingers to the man's throat.  His pulse was weak, erratic.  The flickering neon sign of a nearby bodega cast long, distorted shadows that danced around her, adding to the already oppressive gloom.

Rumors whispered amongst the city's dockworkers spoke of illicit dealings and shadowy figures, a truth Amy was increasingly familiar with.  She hated the way the shadows seemed to swallow the light, to consume the hope that clung to the city like a fragile vine. Tonight, it felt especially insidious.
