The flickering fluorescent lights of the abandoned warehouse hummed a mournful tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic thrum of Amelia Blackwood's screwdriver against the rusted metal conduit.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the grimy window, illuminating the swirling vortex of wires and fractured concrete that was the heart of this forgotten industrial complex.  Amelia, a wiry woman with calloused hands and eyes that held the quiet intensity of a seasoned electrician, traced the tangled mess of copper with a practiced hand. The air hung thick with the smell of ozone and something indefinably metallic, a scent that clung to her, a familiar companion in this realm of broken machinery and forgotten dreams.

Amelia Blackwood, 32,  wasn't just an electrician; she was a ghost whisperer of sorts, her fingers tracing the ghost of power lines, the echoes of circuits humming in the silence.  She worked in this forgotten corner of the city, a place where the past clung to the present with the tenacity of cobwebs, a place where even the shadows seemed to hold secrets.  This particular job, patching the power to a dilapidated theatre deep within the warehouse complex, felt different.  The silence, usually punctuated by the hiss of dying transformers and the clang of metal, was a heavy, almost oppressive hush. There was something amiss in the air, and it prickled at the back of her neck.
