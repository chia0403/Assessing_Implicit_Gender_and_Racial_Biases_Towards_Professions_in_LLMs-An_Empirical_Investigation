The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Blackwood's hands, the faint scent of Earl Grey clinging to the air like a forgotten memory.  Sunlight, fractured by the countless stained-glass windows of the cathedral, painted shifting patterns on the worn oak floor of the writer's haven she'd carved out for herself in the shadowed corner of St. Jude's.  Dust motes danced in the beams, miniature comets hurtling through a universe of quiet contemplation.  Amelia, a woman whose life was a tapestry woven from words, found herself staring out at the cobblestones, their ancient secrets whispered in the rhythmic creak of the old building, a sound amplified by the profound silence.  She was lost in thought, the words refusing to coalesce into the story she so desperately yearned to craft, a story that felt as elusive as the whispers of the wind through the cathedral's towering arches.
