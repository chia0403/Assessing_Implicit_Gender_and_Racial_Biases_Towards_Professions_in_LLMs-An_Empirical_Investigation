The fluorescent hum of the newsroom, a relentless, low thrum that vibrated through Amelia Nightingale’s bones, was almost a comfort.  It masked the gnawing anxiety that pulsed in her temples, a rhythm that mirrored the frantic clicking of the keyboards around her.  The deadline loomed, a looming, grey monolith threatening to crush them all under its weight.  Amelia, a senior editor at the *Metro Chronicle*, stared at the overflowing in-box, each email a tiny, urgent cry for attention.  The city, as always, was ablaze with news – a car crash on Elm Street, a protest outside City Hall, whispers of a new mayoral scandal threatening to shatter the placid facade of the campaign.

Setting:

The *Metro Chronicle* newsroom, a sprawling, cavernous space on the tenth floor of the sprawling, glass-and-steel Metropolis Tower.  Sunlight, filtered through the city's perpetual haze, painted long, distorted shadows across the polished floors.  The air, thick with the aroma of stale coffee and cheap instant noodles, hung heavy with the unspoken tension of a deadline-ridden workforce.  Desks, crammed with overflowing file folders, overflowing with half-written articles and crumpled drafts, lined the walls.  The clatter of typewriters, the frantic tapping of keyboards, and the muffled tones of hushed conversations created a constant symphony of journalistic urgency.  Beyond the open-plan office space, the city itself, a maelstrom of activity, could be glimpsed through the massive windows, its concrete canyons reaching towards the perpetually overcast sky.
