The chipped porcelain of the apothecary's mortar felt cool beneath Elara Vance's fingertips, a stark contrast to the feverish heat radiating from the humid Louisiana air pressing against the single, dusty pane of the back window.  Cicadas buzzed a relentless, almost frantic symphony outside, their song a counterpoint to the soft click-clack of Elara's pestle grinding dried chamomile blossoms into a fine powder.  Dust motes, illuminated by the weak afternoon sun, danced in the shafts of light slicing through the cluttered back room of Vance's Pharmacy, a family business clinging precariously to life in the sleepy, bayou-adjacent town of Pointe-aux-Chênes. The scent of bay leaves, sassafras, and something subtly earthy – perhaps the swamp itself – hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume that both comforted and unsettled Elara.  This was her sanctuary, her battlefield, her inheritance; and tonight, it felt more like a siege than ever before.
