The biting wind whipped across the desolate expanse of the Nevada desert, stinging Elias Thorne's cheeks raw.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of grit and sand, danced across the cracked asphalt of Highway 50, the loneliest road in America, a fitting backdrop for Elias’s solitary existence.  He hunched deeper into his worn orange work jacket, the reflective stripes barely visible in the pre-dawn gloom, and adjusted the brim of his battered hard hat.  The air, thin and cold, tasted of sagebrush and diesel fumes, a familiar perfume in his life.  His pickup truck, a rusty behemoth affectionately nicknamed "The Mule," sat idling nearby, its engine a low growl against the otherwise silent landscape.  The sun, a bruised purple orb on the horizon, promised another brutally hot day repaving this forgotten stretch of road – a day much like the last, and the one before that, stretching back as far as Elias could remember.
