The radio crackled with static, a futile attempt at communication swallowed by the tempest raging outside.  She was alone, high above the unforgiving wilderness, a tiny speck against the immense, indifferent power of nature, her only companion the rhythmic thump of the engine, a heartbeat against the deafening roar of the storm.
