The midday sun beat down on Amelia Hernandez’s shoulders, turning the already-sticky air of the Louisiana bayou into a thick, shimmering haze.  Cicadas buzzed a relentless, hypnotic rhythm, a soundtrack to the swamp’s humid symphony.  Amelia, her straw hat perched precariously on her head, adjusted the strap of her worn canvas bag, its contents – binoculars, a battered field guide, and a half-eaten bag of pralines – shifting slightly.  The air hung heavy with the scent of decaying vegetation and the cloying sweetness of honeysuckle, a perfume both alluring and slightly unsettling.  Before her, a gaggle of tourists, their faces a mixture of anticipation and apprehension, shuffled their feet on the rickety wooden boardwalk that snaked its way through the heart of Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve.  This was Amelia’s domain, her stage, her swamp.  And today’s performance, she hoped, would be a memorable one.
