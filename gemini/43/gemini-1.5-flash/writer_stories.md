The chipped paint of Amelia Katherine Blackwood’s writing desk flaked onto the manuscript spread before her, a tiny, ironic snowfall mirroring the blizzard raging outside.  January in the Scottish Highlands had a bite that went beyond the frost clinging to the windowpanes of her rented cottage, a bite that seemed to seep into the very marrow of her bones and chill the already lukewarm enthusiasm for her current project – a historical romance set in the sun-drenched Tuscan countryside.  The irony, Amelia thought, was almost unbearable.  The flickering gas lamp cast long, dancing shadows across the cluttered room, illuminating stacks of books, overflowing ashtrays (a habit she was trying, and failing, to break), and a half-empty bottle of something amber and potent that promised temporary oblivion.  Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, a soundtrack to her writer's block, a constant reminder of the stark contrast between her idyllic fictional world and the bleak reality of her own.
