The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Elias Thorne's nightly ritual.  Elias, a man whose life was measured in the rhythmic squeak of his mop bucket and the satisfying swish of the cleaning fluid, surveyed the deserted expanse of the Grand Central Galleria.

The echoes of a thousand hurried footsteps and whispered conversations seemed to cling to the air, a ghostly testament to the day's frantic energy, now swallowed by the quietude of the night.
