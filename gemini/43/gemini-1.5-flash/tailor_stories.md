The scent of aged linen and woodsmoke hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Elias Thorne, master tailor of Threadneedle Street.  Rain lashed against the leaded windows of his small, cluttered shop, blurring the gaslight’s hazy glow into a watercolour smear of orange and grey.  Water trickled down the panes, mirroring the steady drip, drip, drip of a leaky tap in the back room where Elias kept his most prized silks, shimmering like captured moonlight even in the gloom.  Outside, the cobblestones gleamed slickly under the relentless downpour, the cries of street vendors muffled by the storm’s fury.  Tonight, however, the usual cacophony of London held a sharper edge, a prickle of unease that even the comforting hum of his sewing machine couldn't quite erase.  Elias, his fingers stained with the vibrant hues of his trade, paused in his work, a fine needle poised above a length of midnight-blue velvet.  Something felt… wrong.
