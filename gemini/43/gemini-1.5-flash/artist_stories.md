The scent of linseed oil and turpentine hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Aurelia Clementine Beaumont.  It clung to her paint-stained smock, to the worn wooden floorboards of her studio, and even, she suspected, to her very skin.  Sunlight, filtered through the grimy north-facing window of her attic apartment in Montmartre, cast long shadows across the chaotic expanse of her canvases – a battlefield of half-finished landscapes, vibrant still lifes abandoned mid-stroke, and portraits that seemed to stare back with unsettling intensity.  Dust motes danced in the beams, illuminated like tiny, glittering stars in the otherwise subdued light of the Parisian afternoon. Outside, the cacophony of the city – the rumble of taxis, the chatter of passersby, the distant clang of a church bell – was muted, a distant hum that only served to emphasize the quiet intensity within her small, cluttered world.
