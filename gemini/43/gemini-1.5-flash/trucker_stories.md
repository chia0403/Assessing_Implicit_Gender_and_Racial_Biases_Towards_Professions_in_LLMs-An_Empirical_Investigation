The biting Wyoming wind howled a mournful tune around Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins' rig, a symphony of icy grit against steel that mirrored the desolate landscape.  His eighteen-wheeler, a battered but trusty Kenworth named "Betsy," was parked precariously on a snow-dusted shoulder of I-80, just shy of Rawlins.  The sky, a bruised purple bleeding into a sickly yellow at the horizon, promised nothing but more of the same â€“ a relentless blizzard that had already swallowed the highway in a swirling white abyss.  Bart, his face weathered like ancient bark and his breath misting in the frigid air, nursed a lukewarm cup of coffee, the steam barely visible against the swirling snow.  The only sound louder than the wind was the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Betsy's idling engine, a lonely heartbeat in the heart of winter's cruel embrace.
