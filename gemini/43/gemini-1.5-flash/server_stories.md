The chipped Formica tabletop vibrated faintly under Amelia Hernandez’s hand as she balanced a precarious tower of three plates – a brimming seafood pasta, a side salad threatening to topple, and a ramekin of garlic bread that smelled suspiciously of burnt butter.  The air in Frankie’s Family Diner hung thick with the smells of frying onions, stale coffee, and the faint, metallic tang of blood – a lingering reminder of the unfortunate incident with the rogue meat slicer earlier that morning.  Fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune above the linoleum floor, reflecting harshly off the Formica and the stained stainless steel counter where a weary cook, sporting a permanent scowl, furiously flipped burgers.  Outside, the relentless Florida sun beat down on the cracked asphalt of Highway 17, baking the already sweltering air.  Amelia sighed, a plume of warm breath misting momentarily in the air-conditioned gloom.  Another Saturday night at Frankie’s – another marathon of spilled drinks, demanding customers, and the lingering hope for a decent tip.
