The wind, a relentless sculptor, clawed at Elias Thorne's jacket as he clung to the dizzying peak of the St. Jude's Cathedral.  Below, the cobblestone streets of Prague twisted like a spilled braid of dark hair, the ancient buildings huddled together like gossiping neighbours.  Gargoyles, grotesques frozen in mid-snarl, leered down from the cathedral's eaves, silent witnesses to Elias’s precarious dance with gravity.  He wasn’t admiring the view, though; Elias Thorne, master roofer and connoisseur of crumbling mortar, was acutely aware of a loose slate the size of a dinner plate, precariously balanced on the edge, threatening to send him plummeting towards the unforgiving stones below.  The late afternoon sun cast long, skeletal shadows from the gothic spires, adding to the already ominous atmosphere.  This wasn't just another job; it was a desperate race against the coming storm.
