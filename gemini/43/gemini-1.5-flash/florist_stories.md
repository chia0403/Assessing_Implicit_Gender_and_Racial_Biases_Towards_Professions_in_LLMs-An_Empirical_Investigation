The scent of lilies, sharp and sweet, hung heavy in the air, a fragrant counterpoint to the gritty, damp chill that clung to the cobblestones of  Rainy Day Row.  Rain, a relentless drizzle that seemed woven into the very fabric of the street, plastered Amelia Katherine "Mel" Hawthorne's dark curls to her forehead.  Her breath plumed white in the frigid air as she wrestled with a recalcitrant delivery cart, its wheels stubbornly refusing to cooperate with the uneven paving stones.  Mel's shop, "Petals & Promises," a tiny oasis of colour tucked between a dusty antique store and a perpetually closed bakery, was a riot of blooms â€“ defiant splashes of crimson roses, delicate lavender sprigs, and the deep, velvety purple of calla lilies, all vying for attention against the grey backdrop of the perpetually overcast sky.  The shop window, steamed with condensation, mirrored a blurry reflection of Mel herself, her face etched with a mixture of determination and the quiet weariness of a woman who fought a constant battle against the elements and the fickle whims of nature.
