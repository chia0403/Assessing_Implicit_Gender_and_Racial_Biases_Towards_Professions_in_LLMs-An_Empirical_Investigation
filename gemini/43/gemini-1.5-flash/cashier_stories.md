The fluorescent hum of the SuperSave supermarket lights buzzed a monotonous soundtrack to Elara Jeannette Willowbrookâ€™s life.  Elara, or Lara as most people called her, leaned against the worn countertop, the cold, smooth plastic a stark contrast to the clammy sweat gathering under her armpits. The air conditioning, a perpetually sputtering beast, did little to combat the August heat that clung to everything like a second skin, even the slightly bruised peaches piled haphazardly in front of her. Outside, the midday sun beat down on the cracked asphalt of the parking lot, baking the already sweltering air to an almost unbearable temperature.  The only relief was the sporadic, almost apologetic, whisper of the wind rustling the wilting impatiens in the plastic pots lining the entrance. This was Lara's reality: aisle five, checkout three, SuperSave, a monotonous symphony of beeping scanners and mumbled apologies.
