The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Hernandez’s hands, a meager comfort against the biting November wind whistling through the gaps in the boarded-up windows of the Rusty Mug.  Rain lashed against the grimy glass, blurring the neon glow of the "Open" sign into a hazy, uncertain promise.  Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of stale beer, spilled whiskey, and desperation – a familiar perfume to Amelia, who'd poured countless drinks for the clientele of this dive bar for the last five years.  The only light came from a single, flickering bulb above the bar, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to mock the stillness of the empty stools.  Tonight, the Rusty Mug felt more like a tomb than a tavern. Even the usual cacophony of drunken laughter and clinking glasses was absent, replaced by an unnerving quiet, broken only by the rhythmic drip, drip, drip of a leaky faucet.
