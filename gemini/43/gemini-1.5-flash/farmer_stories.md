The pre-dawn chill bit at Elias Thorne's cheeks, a familiar sting that spoke of another day beginning on his family's land.  Elias, a man etched by sun and wind into the very landscape he tilled, stood at the edge of his barley field, the pale gold stalks whispering secrets only he could understand in the hushed quiet.  Mist clung to the valley below, a swirling, ethereal river that snaked its way around the ancient oak at the bottom of the hill, its gnarled branches reaching up like skeletal fingers grasping at the dawning light.  The air, still heavy with the scent of damp earth and ripening grain, carried a faint, almost imperceptible sweetness, the promise of a summer's day, but in Elias's heart, a different kind of unease stirred, a premonition as cold and sharp as the morning air.  He knew, somehow, that this harvest would be unlike any other.
