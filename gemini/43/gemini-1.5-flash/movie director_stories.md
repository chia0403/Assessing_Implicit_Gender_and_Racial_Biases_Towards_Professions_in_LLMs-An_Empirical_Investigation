The air crackled with tension, not just from the oppressive weather, but from the simmering feud between the lead actor, a notorious method-actor prone to disappearing for days at a time, and the volatile cinematographer, who seemed convinced Izzy was intentionally sabotaging his meticulously crafted shots.  Izzy sighed, the sound barely audible above the cicadas' drone. This was shaping up to be her most challenging project yet.
