The biting November wind howled a mournful tune through the gaps in the boarded-up windows of Blackwood Manor, rattling the ancient panes like skeletal fingers.  Rain, icy and relentless, lashed against the crumbling stonework, turning the overgrown driveway into a churning river of mud.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of damp earth and something far less pleasant – the cloying sweetness of decay.  This wasn't the kind of job that appealed to most plumbers, but then, Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield wasn't most plumbers.  He'd seen things.  He'd smelled things.  He'd even, on one memorable occasion, wrestled a rather disgruntled badger out of a Victorian lavatory.  But Blackwood Manor promised something… different.  Something that even Barty, with his years of experience plunging toilets and unclogging drains, felt a prickle of unease about.
