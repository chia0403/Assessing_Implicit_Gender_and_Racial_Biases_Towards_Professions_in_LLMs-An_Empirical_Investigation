The scent of lavender and old silk hung heavy in the air, a comforting perfume that clung to the velvet curtains and the worn wooden floors of Esmelia “Esme” Hawthorne’s atelier.  Dust motes, illuminated by the afternoon sun slanting through the tall, arched window, danced in the stillness.  Outside, the cobbled streets of Prague hummed with the low thrum of horse-drawn carriages and the chattering of market vendors, a sound completely muffled by the thick stone walls of Esme’s building, nestled discreetly on a quiet side street in the Old Town.  Esme, herself, was a picture of focused calm amidst this tranquil chaos.  Her nimble fingers, stained a delicate ochre from years of working with dyes, meticulously stitched a delicate bead onto a cascade of emerald green silk, the fabric shimmering like a captured forest.  The half-finished gown, destined for a countess’s ball, lay draped across a tailor’s dummy, its form already hinting at the breathtaking elegance it would soon possess.
