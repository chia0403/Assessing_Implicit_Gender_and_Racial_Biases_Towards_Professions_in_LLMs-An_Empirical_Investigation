The chipped porcelain mug warmed Dr. Eleanor Vance's hands, a meager comfort against the November chill seeping through the single-pane windows of her office.  Rain lashed against the glass, a relentless drumming that mirrored the anxiety churning in her stomach.  Her small, book-lined office, tucked away on the third floor of a rambling Victorian building in the heart of sleepy Oakhaven, usually felt safe, a sanctuary of calm amidst the storms of her clients' lives.  But tonight, the storm felt intensely personal.  The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the worn Persian rug, highlighting the dust motes swirling in the air like tiny, frantic worries.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune, a stark contrast to the quiet, expectant silence within, a silence that felt heavy with unspoken dread.  Eleanor took a deep breath, the scent of old paper and damp earth filling her lungs, and braced herself for the arrival of her last appointment of the day.
