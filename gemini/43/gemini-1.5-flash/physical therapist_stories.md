The salt spray stung Dr. Eleanor Vanceâ€™s face as she wrestled the stubborn fishing net free from the barnacles clinging to the weathered pilings.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and decaying seaweed, whipped her already wind-chapped lips raw.  Above her, the grey sky of the Outer Banks hung low and heavy, promising another squall.  Eleanor, however, barely noticed.  Her focus was entirely on the tangled mess before her, a fitting metaphor, she thought wryly, for the complicated life of her patient, Captain Silas Blackwood, whose recovery she was now, rather improbably, overseeing in this remote, windswept corner of North Carolina. The dilapidated fishing shack, perched precariously on the edge of the sound, served as both Silas's home and his impromptu physiotherapy clinic.  The rhythmic crash of waves against the shore provided a constant, almost hypnotic, soundtrack to their unconventional therapy sessions.
