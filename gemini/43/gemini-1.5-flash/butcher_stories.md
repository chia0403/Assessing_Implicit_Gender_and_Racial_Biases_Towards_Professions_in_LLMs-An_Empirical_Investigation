The chill wind, thick with the scent of woodsmoke and brine, whipped at Archibald “Archie” Bartholomew’s thick wool coat as he navigated the cobbled streets of Oakhaven.  Ice, slick as a viper’s tongue, coated the uneven stones, threatening to send him sprawling into the gutter alongside discarded fish heads and the occasional stray cabbage.  Archie, however, was unfazed.  Years spent hauling carcasses far heavier than any man ought to, had gifted him a surefootedness that rivaled the sturdy oak trees that lent Oakhaven its name.  The early morning light, a weak, watery sun struggling to pierce the grey clouds, glinted off the frost clinging to his handlebar moustache, highlighting the faint crimson stain on his apron – a testament to the day’s work already begun.  His shop, Bartholomew’s Meats, stood at the end of the street, a sturdy, timber-framed building smelling powerfully of blood, salt, and something subtly… spicy.  Inside, the warmth promised solace from the biting wind and the comforting scent of roasting nuts hinted at a day as bustling and flavourful as a well-seasoned gammon.
