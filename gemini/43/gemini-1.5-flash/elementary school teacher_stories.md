The chipped paint of the "Welcome to Ms. Eleanor Vance's Classroom" sign flaked onto the dusty floorboards, mirroring the slow decay of Eleanor Vance's own enthusiasm.  It was the last week of school, a week traditionally reserved for frantic end-of-year projects, chaotic classroom clean-ups, and the bittersweet farewells to a flock of bright, messy children she’d poured her heart into for the past ten months.  But this year felt different.  This year, the usual hum of chaotic energy in Room 2B of Lincoln Elementary was replaced by a heavy, suffocating silence.  The usual cacophony of giggling, arguing, and the rhythmic scratching of pencils had been swallowed by a humid, pre-storm stillness, a stillness that mirrored the knot of unease tightening in Eleanor’s stomach. The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of old crayons and impending summer rain, a scent that usually brought a sense of relief, but today only served to amplify the growing dread.
