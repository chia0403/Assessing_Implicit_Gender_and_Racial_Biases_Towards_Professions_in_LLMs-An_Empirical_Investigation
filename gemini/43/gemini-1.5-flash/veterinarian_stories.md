The biting November wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vance’s auburn hair across her face as she wrestled the heavy oak door of the Alder Creek Animal Clinic open.  The scent that greeted her was a familiar, comforting, and yet perpetually unsettling cocktail: antiseptic, pine needles, wet dog, and the faintly metallic tang of fear.  Alder Creek, nestled deep in the Oregon Coast Range, was a town where the only things more plentiful than rain were the eccentric personalities and the injured wildlife that stumbled – or were dragged – into her care.  The clinic itself, a rambling Victorian farmhouse retrofitted with examination rooms and surgery suites, groaned under the weight of years and the constant influx of furry, feathered, and scaly patients.  Tonight, however, the groaning seemed louder, more ominous, even to Eleanor’s practiced ears.  A thin layer of snow already dusted the overgrown rhododendrons lining the driveway, hinting at the harsher weather to come – and perhaps, the harsher challenges waiting inside.
