The Alaskan wind howled a mournful song around Dr. Alistair Finch’s isolated dental practice, rattling the frost-covered windows and threatening to tear the flimsy ‘Open’ sign from its moorings.  Snow, thick and relentless, piled high against the clapboard walls of the building, a lone sentinel against the vast, unforgiving expanse of the Yukon wilderness.  Inside, the air was surprisingly warm, scented with the antiseptic tang of sterilizing solution and the faintly sweet aroma of cinnamon from the mug warming on Alistair’s desk.  A single, flickering oil lamp cast long, dancing shadows across the worn wooden floorboards, illuminating the sterile gleam of his instruments laid out on the tray – a stark contrast to the wild, untamed beauty raging just beyond the glass.  This wasn’t exactly the bustling metropolis Alistair had envisioned when he’d graduated top of his class at the University of Washington, but then again, he’d needed the escape.  And besides, someone had to cater to the surprisingly extensive dental needs of the rugged inhabitants of Eagle Creek.
