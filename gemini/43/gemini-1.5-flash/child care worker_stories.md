The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne's auburn braid across her face as she hurried down Maple Street, the collar of her worn peacoat pulled high.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a familiar aroma in the quaint, slightly dilapidated New England town of Havenwood.  Havenwood, with its crooked cobblestone streets, gingerbread houses clinging to the hillside, and a pervasive air of quiet secrets, was the perfect backdrop for Little Blessings Daycare, where Amelia worked.  The daycare, a converted Victorian house with peeling paint and a slightly overgrown garden, sat nestled between a bakery that smelled perpetually of cinnamon and a dusty antique shop where time seemed to stand still.  Inside, the cacophony of children's laughter and the rhythmic clatter of building blocks promised a day far removed from the November chill outside.
