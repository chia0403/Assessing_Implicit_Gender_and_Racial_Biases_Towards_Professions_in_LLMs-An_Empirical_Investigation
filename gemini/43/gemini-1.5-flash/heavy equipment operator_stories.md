The rasping cough of the Caterpillar D11T echoed through the pre-dawn chill, a sound as familiar to Elias Thorne as his own heartbeat.  Dust, the fine, ochre dust of the Mojave Desert, swirled around the gargantuan machine like a malevolent spirit, clinging to everything – Elias’s grizzled beard, the worn leather of his gloves, even the chipped paint of the bulldozer’s blade.  The sun, a bruised plum hanging low on the horizon, cast long, skeletal shadows from the skeletal mountains that ringed the vast, sun-baked quarry.  This was Thorne’s domain, a kingdom of rock and earth stretching for miles, where the only sounds louder than the D11T were the occasional crack of fracturing granite and the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Elias's own relentless work.  Today, however, a different kind of tremor ran through the air – a nervous energy that even the earth-moving behemoth couldn't quite drown out.
