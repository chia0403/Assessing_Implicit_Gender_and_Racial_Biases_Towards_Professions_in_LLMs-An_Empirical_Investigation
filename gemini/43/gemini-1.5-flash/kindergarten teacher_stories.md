The chipped paint of the "Welcome to Ms. Eleanor Vance's Classroom!" sign flaked like autumn leaves onto the already cluttered welcome mat.  Inside, a cacophony of tiny voices, the rhythmic squeak of crayons, and the insistent thud of tiny feet against the worn linoleum floor announced the chaotic symphony of a typical Tuesday morning at Sunny Meadows Kindergarten.  Sunlight, filtered through the dusty windowpanes, illuminated motes of dust dancing in the air, each a tiny, shimmering spotlight on the impending chaos of circle time.  Ms. Eleanor Vance, a woman whose kind eyes belied the battlefield she commanded daily, sighed, a sound that was swallowed whole by the boisterous chorus of five-year-olds.  The smell of peanut butter and slightly damp paint hung heavy in the air, a familiar and strangely comforting aroma that, to Ms. Vance, smelled distinctly of possibility.
