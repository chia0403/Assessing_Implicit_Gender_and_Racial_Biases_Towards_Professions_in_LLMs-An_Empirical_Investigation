The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face as he wrestled the heavy coil of armored cable onto the reeling platform.  The wind, a relentless, howling beast, threatened to rip the temporary scaffolding from the craggy face of the cliff. Below, the churning grey expanse of the North Atlantic roared its disapproval, the waves crashing against the jagged rocks with a violence that mirrored the turmoil in Elias’s gut.  He wasn't used to working at this altitude, nor this far from civilization. The only sounds louder than the ocean were the hammering of the wind and the rhythmic whirring of his work boots on the metal grating.  His job – to rewire the dilapidated lighthouse perched precariously on the edge of the world – felt less like a simple electrical contract and more like a perilous dance with fate.  The island of Ailsa Craig, usually a postcard-perfect beauty, was today a scowling, unforgiving giant, testing Elias's skills and nerve to their absolute limit.
