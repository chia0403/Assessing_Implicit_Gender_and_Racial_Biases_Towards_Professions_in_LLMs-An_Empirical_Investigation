Its myriad windows, like vacant eyes, stared out at the storm, reflecting the stormy turmoil brewing inside Eleanor herself.  The gravel crunched ominously under her worn leather boots as she ascended the long, winding drive, the only sound louder than the wind's mournful howl being the frantic thump-thump-thump of her own heart.  This wasn't a routine house call; this was a summons to a place where shadows lingered longer than the twilight.
