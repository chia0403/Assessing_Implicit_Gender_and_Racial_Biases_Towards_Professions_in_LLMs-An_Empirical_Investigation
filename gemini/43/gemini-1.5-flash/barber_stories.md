The scent of Bay Rum and stale coffee hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield.  Barty, proprietor of Butterfield's Barbershop & Shaves, surveyed his domain: a cramped but cozy space on the corner of Bleecker and Mercer, a haven tucked away from the relentless churn of Greenwich Village.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight slanting through the grimy window, illuminating the faded red-and-white striped pole outside and the chipped porcelain mugs on the shelf.  The worn leather barber chair creaked a mournful sigh beneath its worn, but surprisingly soft, vinyl covering.  Outside, the cacophony of New York City – the blare of car horns, the chatter of pedestrians, the distant wail of a siren – was muted to a dull roar by the thick, insulated walls of his little sanctuary.  It was a Tuesday, and so far, a Tuesday as uneventful as any other.  Except, Barty had a feeling this Tuesday was about to change.
