The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Holloway's dark hair across her face as she hurried down the cobblestone street, the collar of her worn peacoat pulled high.  The air, thick with the scent of woodsmoke and brine, carried the mournful cry of gulls overhead.  This wasn't the sterile, antiseptic environment of the clinic where Amelia usually spent her days; this was Oakhaven, a remote coastal village clinging precariously to the cliffs of the rugged Cornish coastline.  Its beauty was undeniable, a stark contrast to the grim purpose of her visit: to assist Dr. Rhys Morgan, a man as enigmatic and unpredictable as the unforgiving sea that crashed against the rocks below.  The single gas lamp illuminating the narrow lane cast long, dancing shadows, making the already dilapidated houses seem even more sinister.  Amelia shivered, pulling her scarf tighter.  It wasn't just the cold; it was the unsettling feeling that settled in her gut, a premonition that this trip would be anything but routine.
