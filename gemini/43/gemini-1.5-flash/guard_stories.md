The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of Xylos, stinging Sergeant Valerius Thorneâ€™s cheeks and making his already stiff fingers ache worse.  He hunched deeper into his worn, grey greatcoat, the rough wool scratching against the chainmail beneath.  Xylos, once a jewel of the Aethelgard Empire, now lay in ruins, a testament to the brutal five-year war against the Kryll.  Valerius stood guard at the crumbling eastern gate of what was once the magnificent city of Porthaven, now little more than a collection of shattered buildings and haunted streets.  The flickering torchlight in his hand cast long, dancing shadows that seemed to writhe like the very ghosts he was sworn to protect the city from. The silence, broken only by the mournful howl of the wind and the occasional scrabble of unseen creatures in the debris, was far more unsettling than any Kryll raiding party.
