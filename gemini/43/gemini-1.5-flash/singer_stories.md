The chipped porcelain sink groaned under the weight of Seraphina "Sera" Nightingale's elbows as she stared at her reflection.  Steam from the kettle, perched precariously on the edge, swirled around her face, momentarily obscuring the faint lines etched by sleepless nights and too much cheap coffee.  The tiny bathroom, barely larger than a walk-in closet, was a chaotic symphony of half-empty shampoo bottles, crumpled sheet music, and the lingering scent of yesterday's reheated ramen.  It was tucked away in the back of "The Rusty Note," a dive bar in the grimy underbelly of Prague, a space Sera called home, office, and rehearsal room all rolled into one cramped, damp package.  Outside, the cobblestones glistened under a November drizzle, the distant rumble of trams a low, constant thrum against the backdrop of the city's ancient heart.  Tonight, however, the usual comforting chaos of Prague felt ominous, the weight of expectation pressing down on Sera like a physical force. Tonight, she was opening for Viktor Volkov, and failure wasn't an option.
