The biting November wind whipped around Officer Amelia “Amy” Hernandez as she wrestled the recalcitrant door of the abandoned mill open.  Rust groaned like a dying beast under the pressure, flakes of paint and crumbling brick raining down on her worn leather jacket.  The air inside hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and something else, something acrid and faintly metallic that prickled at the back of her throat.  It smelled of fear, Amy thought, a cold, clinging fear that had settled into the very bones of this forgotten place – the Blackwood Textile Mill, a skeletal monument to a town’s lost prosperity, now a haven for shadows and whispers. The only sound, aside from the wind whistling through shattered windows, was the rhythmic drip, drip, drip of water echoing through the cavernous space.  This wasn't the kind of call Amy usually got on her night shift in the sleepy town of Havenwood, but it was the call that had brought her to this desolate, crumbling behemoth under a sky the colour of bruised plums.
