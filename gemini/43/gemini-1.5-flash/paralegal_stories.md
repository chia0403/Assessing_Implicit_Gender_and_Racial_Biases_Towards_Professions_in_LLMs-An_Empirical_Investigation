The flickering neon sign of "Benny's Burgers" cast a lurid, greasy glow across the rain-slicked streets of downtown Scranton.  The smell of frying onions, usually comforting, tonight only served to highlight the gnawing emptiness in Amelia Katherine Hayes' stomach. Amelia, a paralegal with a penchant for caffeine and a perpetually overflowing inbox at the notoriously cutthroat law firm of Sterling & Vance, hadn't had a decent meal in thirty-six hours.  The relentless demands of Mr. Sterling’s latest high-profile case – a bitter divorce involving a disgruntled tech mogul and his equally ambitious ex-wife – had left her running on fumes and sheer willpower.  Rain lashed against the window of her tiny, rent-controlled apartment, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  Tonight, however, it wasn't just the case that kept her awake.  A cryptic note, tucked into the overflowing pile of legal documents on her desk, promised answers to a mystery that ran far deeper than anything she’d ever encountered in the sterile confines of Sterling & Vance.
