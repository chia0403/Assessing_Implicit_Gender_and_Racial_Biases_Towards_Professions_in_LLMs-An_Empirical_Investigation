The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorne’s ankles, stinging the exposed skin above his worn work boots.  Dust, the fine grey grit of pulverized concrete and decades-old brick, clung to his eyelashes and the collar of his faded denim jacket.  Above him, the skeletal frame of the old St. Jude’s orphanage clawed at the bruised twilight sky, a testament to both the city's neglect and Elias's increasingly desperate efforts to salvage it.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth, rusting metal, and the faint, underlying sweetness of decaying wood – a perfume only a seasoned demolition man could truly appreciate.  Elias, sweat beading on his forehead despite the cold, adjusted the worn leather straps of his demolition hammer, its weight a familiar comfort in his calloused hands.  The last remaining section of the east wing, a precarious stack of crumbling bricks and groaning timbers, threatened to collapse at any moment – a fitting metaphor, he mused, for his own life.
