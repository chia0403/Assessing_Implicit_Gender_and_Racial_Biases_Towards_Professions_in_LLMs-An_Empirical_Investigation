The salt spray stung Eleanor Vance’s face as she wrestled the stubborn fishing net free from the barnacle-encrusted pilings.  The air hung thick with the smell of brine and decaying seaweed, a familiar scent that usually calmed her, but today only served to amplify the knot of anxiety tightening in her stomach.  Above her, the skeletal frame of the old pier groaned under the relentless assault of the late-autumn wind, mirroring the turmoil within her.  Eleanor, a registered occupational therapist with a decade of experience in pediatric rehabilitation, wasn't used to this kind of rough-and-tumble work.  She was used to brightly lit therapy rooms, the comforting scent of antiseptic, and the hopeful faces of her young patients.  But today, the salty tang of the Maine coast was her office, and her patient was a stubborn, weathered fishing net – a metaphor, perhaps, for the far greater challenges awaiting her.
