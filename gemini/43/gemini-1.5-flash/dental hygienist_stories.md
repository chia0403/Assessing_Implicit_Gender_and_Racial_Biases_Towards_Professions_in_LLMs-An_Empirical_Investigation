The fluorescent lights of Dr. Albright's office hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the rhythmic squeak of Seraphina "Sera"  Delacroix's scaler against a particularly stubborn molar.  The air, thick with the cloying sweetness of fluoride and the metallic tang of blood (a tiny nick, thankfully), held the faint, underlying scent of impending rain. Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the rain-slicked streets of Portland, Oregon, promising a deluge that would transform the city's already vibrant green into a glistening emerald jewel.  Sera, her fingers deft and precise, barely registered the approaching storm. Her focus was entirely on the patient before her â€“ a nervous, fidgeting man whose jaw was clenched so tight it could crack a walnut.  The rhythmic scraping was her meditation, the patient's eventual sigh of relief her reward.  But today, something felt different. A subtle tremor ran through the building, far deeper than the usual vibrations of city traffic.  And it wasn't the rain.
