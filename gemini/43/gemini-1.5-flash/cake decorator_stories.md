The scent of almond extract hung heavy and sweet in the air, a perfume as familiar to  Seraphina "Sera" Nightingale as the smell of her own skin.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight slicing through the gloom of her tiny, cluttered shop, "Sera's Sweet Surrender,"  illuminating swirling clouds of powdered sugar clinging to every surface.  Outside, the relentless November rain hammered against the mismatched windowpanes, a percussive rhythm against the gentle hum of the refrigerator housing her carefully curated collection of buttercream frostings, each a jewel-toned whisper of flavour. Sera, her flour-dusted apron stained with a rainbow of past masterpieces, hummed along to the mournful strains of a jazz standard crackling from a vintage radio perched precariously on a stack of cake boxes. Tonight, however, the usual comforting chaos felt different; a prickle of unease tightened her already knotted stomach.  A sense of foreboding, as heavy and rich as her signature chocolate ganache, clung to the air.
