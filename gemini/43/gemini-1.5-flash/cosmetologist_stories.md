The scent of vanilla and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a cloying perfume clinging to the plush velvet curtains and the worn, floral wallpaper of Evangeline "Evie" Dubois' salon.  Rain lashed against the arched windows of "Evie's Enhancements," blurring the already-dim streetlights of the quaint, cobbled lane in the historic district of Charleston, South Carolina.  Inside, the only illumination came from a single, flickering chandelier casting long, dancing shadows across the antique styling chairs and the overflowing shelves of hair products, their vibrant hues a stark contrast to the brooding storm raging outside.  Evie herself, a whirlwind of auburn curls and expertly applied crimson lipstick, was hunched over a client's head, her nimble fingers weaving magic amongst a tangle of platinum blonde extensions.  The rhythmic snip-snip of her shears provided a counterpoint to the drumming rain, a steady beat in the otherwise chaotic symphony of the night.
