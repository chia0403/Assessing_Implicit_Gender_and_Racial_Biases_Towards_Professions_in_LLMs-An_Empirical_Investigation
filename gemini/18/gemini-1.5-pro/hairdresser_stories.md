The relentless London drizzle seemed determined to plaster Amelia “Amy” Hawthorne’s carefully coiffed auburn bob to the side of her face.  She tucked a stray strand behind her ear, sighing as she unlocked the door to “Scissor & Comb,” her tiny salon nestled between a perpetually overflowing charity shop and a greengrocer with a distinct fondness for overly ripe mangoes.  The scent of hairspray, lavender oil, and that faintly burnt smell that came from Mrs. Higgins’ weekly perm still clung to the air, a comforting aroma that always made Amy feel like she was home.  Inside, the salon was a kaleidoscope of warm light bouncing off chrome and mirrors. Two empty styling chairs sat patiently waiting, their sleek black leather gleaming under the glow of the overhead spotlights.  Amy glanced at the vintage clock on the wall – 7:55 AM.  Five minutes until her first appointment, and hopefully a brief respite from the dreary November morning.
