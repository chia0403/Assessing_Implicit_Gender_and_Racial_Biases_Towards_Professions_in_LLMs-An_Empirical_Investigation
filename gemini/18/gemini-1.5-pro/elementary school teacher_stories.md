The fluorescent lights of Mrs. Eleanor Vance's fourth-grade classroom hummed a monotonous tune, punctuated by the rhythmic squeak of sneakers on freshly waxed linoleum. Room 4B at Maplewood Elementary, nestled in the heart of drowsy Willow Creek, Vermont, was a riot of color.  Paper butterflies, crafted with painstaking detail, fluttered from the ceiling, while student artwork, showcasing varying degrees of artistic talent, adorned every available inch of wall space. Outside, the October wind rustled the fiery leaves of the ancient maple that gave the school its name, hinting at the crisp air and the promise of the first snowfall soon to blanket the small town. Eleanor, her brown hair pulled back in a practical bun, surveyed the scene with a mixture of fondness and fatigue. It was a Friday afternoon, the last hour ticking by with agonizing slowness, and her twenty-two charges were vibrating with a barely contained weekend energy that threatened to erupt into utter chaos at any moment.  This particular Friday, however, felt different. A strange stillness hung in the air, a premonition of somethingâ€¦unusual.
