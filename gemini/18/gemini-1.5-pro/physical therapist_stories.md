The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, rattling the large windows of Rejuvenate Physical Therapy and sending a shiver down Dr. Elias Thorne's spine. Inside, the clinic was a sanctuary of warmth, smelling faintly of antiseptic and the lavender-scented hand sanitizer Elias insisted on.  He watched the swirling snow obscure the already fading daylight, Chicago's iconic skyline slowly disappearing behind a veil of white. It was late December, a week before Christmas, and Elias was looking forward to a rare, quiet evening. His last patient, Mrs. Henderson, had just hobbled out, cane clicking rhythmically on the polished floor, leaving Elias alone in the softly lit space. The only sound now was the gentle hum of the ultrasound machine cooling down in the corner, a counterpoint to the howling wind outside.  He rubbed his hands together, feeling the familiar ache in his own wrist, a lingering reminder of a skiing accident years ago. He'd chosen this profession, ironically, because of that injury.  Little did he know that tonight, the quiet wouldn't last.
