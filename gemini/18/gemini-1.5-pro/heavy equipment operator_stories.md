The biting November wind whipped across the vast, ochre expanse of the Alberta prairie, carrying the scent of diesel and frozen earth.  Amelia "Milly" Jane Hawthorne squinted against the stinging grit, pulling her thick knit cap further down over her ears. Dawn hadn't fully broken yet, painting the eastern sky in bruised purples and icy blues, but Milly was already perched in the heated cab of her D11T dozer, the rumble of the engine a comforting vibration against the pre-dawn chill.  Around her, the skeletal steel frames of the future potash mine rose like skeletal giants against the flat horizon, their shadows long and skeletal in the nascent light.  This was Milly's domain, a desolate landscape slowly being reshaped by her skilled hands and the raw power of the machines she commanded. Today, however, held a different kind of tension in the air. Something beyond the usual pressure of deadlines and quotas.  A whisper of unease had settled over the site like the first frost of the season, and Milly couldn't shake the feeling that the ground beneath her treads held more than just potash.
