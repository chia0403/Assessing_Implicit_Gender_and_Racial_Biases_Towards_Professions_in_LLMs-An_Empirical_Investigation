The siren’s wail was a lullaby to Amelia “Amy” Rodriguez. It blended with the rhythmic thump of the tires against the cracked asphalt of Interstate 95 as the Miami-Dade Fire Rescue ambulance sliced through the pre-dawn traffic. Rain, a near-constant companion in South Florida, lashed against the windshield, blurring the neon glow of the all-night diners and gas stations. Inside the rig, the air throbbed with tension.  Amy, her dark hair pulled back in a tight braid, adjusted the oxygen mask on the elderly woman strapped to the gurney. The woman's breaths were shallow, each one a ragged gasp. Amy monitored the vital signs on the screen beside her, her brow furrowed with concern.  The humid air hung heavy, thick with the smell of antiseptic and the metallic tang of fear.  Dispatch crackled over the radio, their voices distorted by static, reporting a multi-car pile-up just ahead, caused by the sudden downpour. Amy's stomach tightened.  This already chaotic night was about to get a whole lot worse.
