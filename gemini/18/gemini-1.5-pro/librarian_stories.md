The frosted breath of Elias Thorne, Head Librarian of the Whispering Pines Public Library, puffed out in small, ghostly clouds as he unlocked the heavy oak doors.  The pre-dawn sky over the small, snow-dusted town of Atheria, Oregon, was a bruised purple, the only sound the rhythmic crunch of his boots on the freshly fallen snow. Whispering Pines, nestled deep within the Cascade foothills, was a town steeped in the kind of quiet that hummed with unseen currents â€“ a place where secrets clung to the fog that perpetually drifted through the towering pines and ancient, gnarled oaks. The library itself, a two-story Victorian building with stained-glass windows depicting scenes from classic literature, sat at the heart of it all, a silent sentinel guarding stories both told and untold. Inside, the air smelled of old paper, beeswax polish, and the faintest hint of woodsmoke from the fireplace that hadn't been lit in years.  Elias, a man of routine, flipped on the lights, illuminating rows upon rows of silent, watchful books, their spines gleaming in the soft glow.  He knew every book, every shelf, every creak of the old building.  But this morning, something felt different. A subtle shift in the air, a prickling at the back of his neck, warned him that the quiet of Whispering Pines was about to be broken.
