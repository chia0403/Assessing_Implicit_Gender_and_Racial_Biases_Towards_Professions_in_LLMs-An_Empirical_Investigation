Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of Ezekiel "Zeke" Holloway's office, a relentless rhythm that mirrored the throbbing in his temples.  Neon light from the "Lucky Clover Motel" across the street bled through the grimy window, painting streaks of lurid green across the peeling floral wallpaper.  Zeke, all six-foot-two of him, slumped in his worn leather chair, the springs groaning in protest.  His office, sandwiched between a laundromat and a perpetually closed fortune teller's parlor on the seedier end of Bleaker Street, Atlantic City, smelled of stale cigarette smoke and desperation â€“ a familiar perfume he'd long since grown accustomed to.  The only illumination aside from the Clover's invasive glow came from a flickering desk lamp, casting long shadows that danced with the flickering neon, turning the overflowing ashtrays and stacks of case files into grotesque still lifes.  The clock on the wall, a chipped porcelain cat with an unnervingly cheerful grin, ticked towards 3 AM. It was the kind of night that bred trouble, and trouble, as Zeke well knew, was his business.
