The rain hammered against the ornate glass doors of the Grand Majestic Hotel, each drop a tiny, insistent drum beat against the hushed opulence within.  Crystal chandeliers scattered fractured rainbows across the polished marble floor, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air.  The air itself hummed with a low thrum of activity â€“ the hushed murmur of conversations, the clink of distant silverware, the almost imperceptible whir of the ancient elevator. This was Genevieve "Gen" Dubois' domain, a kingdom of hushed requests and meticulously fulfilled desires.  She stood behind the gleaming mahogany concierge desk, a poised figure in a crisp navy suit, her auburn hair pulled back in a sleek chignon.  Tonight, however, the usual calm anticipation of a Saturday evening was laced with a distinct, unsettling tension.  Outside, the storm raged, and inside, Gen felt a similar tempest brewing, a premonition of something about to disrupt the delicate equilibrium of the Grand Majestic.
