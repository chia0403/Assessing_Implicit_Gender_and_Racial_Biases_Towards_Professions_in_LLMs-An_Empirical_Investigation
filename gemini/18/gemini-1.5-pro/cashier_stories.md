The fluorescent lights of the Quick Stop, a 24-hour convenience store nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed-down Chinese restaurant, hummed a monotonous tune. Rain hammered against the grimy windows, blurring the neon glow of the "Open" sign.  Inside, the air hung thick with the aroma of stale coffee and hot dogs rotating endlessly on greasy rollers.  Eleanor Vance, her name tag slightly askew on her faded blue uniform shirt, sighed, tapping her chipped red nails on the worn countertop. It was 2:17 am on a Tuesday, the slowest, dreariest shift of the week, and she was already counting down the minutes until six.  Outside, a lone figure huddled beneath the awning, the flickering streetlight casting elongated shadows that danced against the rain-slicked asphalt.  Eleanor watched as the figure began to approach, a shiver of unease tracing its way down her spine.  This wasn't her usual late-night crowd of truckers and insomniacs.  There was somethingâ€¦ different about this one.
