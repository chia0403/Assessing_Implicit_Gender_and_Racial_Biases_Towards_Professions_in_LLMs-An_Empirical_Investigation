The biting Antarctic wind whipped at Dr. Aris Thorne's parka, stinging his exposed cheeks even through the layers of thermal fleece.  He squinted, his breath fogging his goggles as he surveyed the desolate expanse of the Ross Ice Shelf.  Towering ice cliffs, sculpted by millennia of wind and erosion, cast long, serrated shadows across the pristine white landscape.  The Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, a cluster of low-slung buildings resembling giant metallic igloos, huddled a few hundred meters away, a beacon of warmth and humanity in this unforgiving wilderness.  Aris, a glaciologist with the British Antarctic Survey, had arrived only two weeks ago, yet the unrelenting isolation and the sheer, breathtaking scale of the ice already had a hold on him.  He wasn't here for the scenery, though.  Buried deep beneath the ice, hidden within a subglacial lake sealed off from the world for eons, lay the reason for his journey – and perhaps the answer to one of science’s greatest mysteries.
