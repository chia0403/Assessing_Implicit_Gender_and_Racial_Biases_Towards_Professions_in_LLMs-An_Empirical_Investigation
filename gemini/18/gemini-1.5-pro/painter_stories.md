The biting November wind whipped around Aurelia Celeste Moreau, plastering stray strands of her auburn hair across her chapped lips. She shivered, pulling her threadbare coat tighter around her as she surveyed the scene before her.  The cobbled streets of Montmartre, usually bustling with artists and tourists, were deserted, save for a lone street vendor hawking roasted chestnuts from a glowing brazier. The air hung thick with the scent of woodsmoke and the approaching rain, a melancholic perfume that perfectly reflected the state of Aurelia's own spirits. Her easel, precariously balanced on the uneven pavement, held a half-finished canvas depicting the Sacré-Cœur Basilica, its white dome shrouded in a swirling mist. The vibrant colours she’d meticulously layered that morning now seemed dull and lifeless in the encroaching gloom, mirroring the gnawing emptiness in her own artistic soul. Paris, the city of lights and inspiration, had become a cage of shadows.
