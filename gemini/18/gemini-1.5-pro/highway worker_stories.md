The sun, a malevolent eye in the bleached sky, beat down on Elias Vance's orange vest, turning the already sweltering fabric into a personal sauna.  Heat shimmered off the asphalt of Interstate 80, blurring the Nevada desert landscape into a wavering mirage. Dust devils, like tiny twisters of discontent, danced across the cracked earth beyond the highway's shoulder.  Elias, sweat plastering his graying sideburns to his temples, adjusted his hard hat and spat a stream of tobacco juice into the thirsty dirt.  Around him, the rhythmic thump of jackhammers and the growl of heavy machinery formed a relentless, industrial symphony.  A section of I-80, buckled and broken by decades of sun and relentless traffic, was undergoing much-needed repairs, and Elias, a Nevada Department of Transportation veteran of twenty-seven years, was overseeing the controlled chaos. This stretch of highway, a lonely ribbon cutting through the heart of nowhere, was his domain, and today, it felt more like a personal purgatory.
