Rain lashed against the arched windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside him.  The rhythmic drumming of the water against the glass usually soothed him, a counterpoint to the chaotic narratives he untangled daily. Tonight, however, it felt like an insistent hammering, each drop a tiny fist pounding at the edges of his composure. His office, perched on the fifth floor of the grimly utilitarian Hennepin County Behavioral Health Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota, offered a panoramic view of the city, but tonight the lights blurring through the downpour offered little comfort.  The air hung thick with the metallic scent of the approaching storm, a scent that Elias always associated with unease, a primal warning whispered down through generations.  He pushed a hand through his already disheveled dark hair, the faint squeak of his leather chair a stark contrast to the roaring wind outside.  On his desk, the case file lay open, the stark black and white mugshot of Bethany Kestrel staring back at him, her eyes dark pools of something he couldn't quite decipher.  Something that chilled him to the bone.
