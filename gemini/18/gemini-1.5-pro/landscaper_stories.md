The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's auburn braid across her face as she surveyed the skeletal remains of Mrs. Periwinkle's prize-winning rose bushes.  Iron-grey clouds scudded low over the sprawling, Victorian-era homes of Ashworth Heights, a neighborhood clinging precariously to the bluff overlooking the churning steel-grey waters of Lake Superior. Amy tucked a stray strand of hair behind her ear, the rough fabric of her work gloves snagging slightly on her chapped skin.  Winter was coming early to Duluth, Minnesota this year, and with it, the end of Amy's landscaping season. This last job, winterizing the fussy gardens of Ashworth Heights' most demanding resident, was the final hurdle before she could shut down Hawthorne Horticulture for the year and retreat to the cozy warmth of her lakeside cabin.  The air, thick with the scent of pine needles and impending snow, carried the mournful cry of a distant foghorn, a sound that both soothed and unsettled Amy in equal measure.
