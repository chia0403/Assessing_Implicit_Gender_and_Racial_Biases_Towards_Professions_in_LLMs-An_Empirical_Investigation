The flickering fluorescent lights of the Zenith BioTech labs hummed a lonely tune for Elias Thorne, the night janitor.  Outside, the Chicago wind howled like a banshee, clawing at the sealed windows of the 47th floor. Elias, his wiry frame swallowed by an oversized, navy blue jumpsuit, pushed his mop bucket across the polished, sterile floor. Reflections of the empty labs, filled with gleaming chrome equipment and bubbling Erlenmeyer flasks, rippled in its soapy surface. It was 2:17 am, the deepest part of the night, a time when even the city that never sleeps seemed to hold its breath.  Zenith BioTech, usually a hive of scientific activity, was now a silent, echoing labyrinth, entrusted to Elias and the ghosts of experiments past. Tonight, however, the silence felt different, charged with an unnatural stillness that pricked at the hairs on the back of his neck.
