The rusty diner sign, shaped like a colossal coffee pot perpetually pouring into an unseen cup, groaned in the wind.  Dust devils danced across the cracked asphalt of the Last Chance Truck Stop, swirling around eighteen-wheelers parked haphazardly like metal behemoths slumbering under the unforgiving Nevada sun.

Ellie, her Kenworth W900 – nicknamed "The Wanderer" – and a thermos full of lukewarm coffee were her only constants in a world of endless highways and fleeting connections.

A crumpled flyer tucked under her windshield wiper promised a lucrative haul to a place she'd never heard of:  Harmony Springs, Oregon, population 312.
