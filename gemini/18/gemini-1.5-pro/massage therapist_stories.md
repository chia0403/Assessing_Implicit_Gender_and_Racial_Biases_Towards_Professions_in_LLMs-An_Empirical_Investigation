The Himalayan salt lamps cast a warm, apricot glow across Serenity Now, illuminating the swirling patterns in the hand-woven Tibetan rug.  Rain lashed against the large bay window, blurring the normally crisp view of the San Francisco skyline. Inside, the air hung thick with the calming scent of lavender and chamomile.  Elara Reyes, her hands still faintly tingling from the last client's knotted shoulders, adjusted the thermostat and sighed.  It was a slow Tuesday evening, the kind where the silence was punctuated only by the rhythmic tick of the antique grandfather clock in the corner and the occasional rumble of a cable car climbing the steep incline outside. Elara glanced at the appointment book, its pages pristine after 7 pm.  A prickle of unease danced at the edge of her calm.  This stillness was unusual, even for a rainy Tuesday.  Then the doorbell chimed, a sharp, insistent sound that sliced through the quiet, and Elara's unease solidified into something colder, something like premonition.
