The biting wind whipped down Bleecker Street, tugging at the awning of "Shear Radiance" and sending a shiver down the spine of Beatrice "Bea" Ophelia Bloom.  Inside, the salon was a warm haven, smelling of coconut oil and hot rollers.  Jazz music purred softly from the speakers, a stark contrast to the chaotic symphony of honking taxis and chattering pedestrians just beyond the large plate-glass window.  Bea, a woman whose vibrant purple streak in her otherwise raven hair matched the salon’s Art Deco-inspired décor, surveyed her domain.  The late afternoon sun, low in the sky, cast long shadows across the checkered floor, illuminating the chrome and velvet chairs, each waiting patiently for its next occupant.  It was a Tuesday, typically a slow day, but Bea had a feeling that *today* would be different.  A feeling that clung to her like the scent of her favourite jasmine tea.
