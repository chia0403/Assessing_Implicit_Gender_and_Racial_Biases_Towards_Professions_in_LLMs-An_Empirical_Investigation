The rain hammered against the leaded glass windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance’s office, mimicking the relentless drumming in her own head.  Her mahogany desk, usually a bastion of order, was littered with half-empty teacups and scattered notes covered in her spidery handwriting. Outside, the twilight crept across the cobbled streets of Bath, painting the honey-coloured Georgian townhouses in shades of lavender and grey.  The gas lamps began to flicker to life, casting a warm glow against the persistent drizzle.  It was a quintessential English evening, cozy and comforting, a stark contrast to the storm brewing inside Eleanor.  She had just finished a particularly harrowing session with a new patient, a young man wrestling with the ghosts of a traumatic past, and the weight of his pain seemed to have settled onto her shoulders, clinging like the damp air.  Eleanor sighed, rubbing the bridge of her nose, the scent of old books and woodsmoke filling the air.  She needed a break, a moment to gather herself before her next appointment, but the unease lingered, a prickly sensation under her skin.  Something felt…off.
