Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of the Zenith Tower, blurring the already fading twilight into a hazy grey.  Forty-two stories below, the Chicago streets shimmered with reflected neon, a kaleidoscope viewed through a watery lens.  Inside, the air was sterile, conditioned to a precise 68 degrees, a stark contrast to the tempest raging outside.  Eleanor Vance Holloway, a systems analyst with a penchant for oversized cardigans and even larger databases, tapped a restless rhythm on her desk with a pen that had seen better days.  Her cubicle, a small island in a sea of identical grey partitions, was a testament to organized chaos.  Stacks of manuals teetered precariously beside half-eaten protein bars, and a tangle of ethernet cables snaked across the worn carpet like metallic vines.  Tonight, however, the usual low hum of server activity was conspicuously absent.  An unsettling silence had fallen over the floor, broken only by the rhythmic drumming of Eleanor's pen and the ominous rumble of distant thunder.  Something was wrong.  Very wrong.
