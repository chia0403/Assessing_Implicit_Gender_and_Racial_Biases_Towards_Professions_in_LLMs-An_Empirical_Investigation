The salt spray kissed Amelia "Amy" Dubois' face as she perched precariously on the jagged rocks overlooking the churning Atlantic. The wind, a relentless sculptor of the coastline, whipped her auburn braids around her like frenzied ribbons, threatening to snatch the worn sketchbook from her grasp.  Here, on the windswept cliffs of Monhegan Island, ten miles off the coast of Maine, Amy felt a strange kinship with the elements. The raw, untamed beauty of the island, a haven for artists for over a century, mirrored the tempestuous emotions swirling within her.  The late afternoon sun, a molten orb sinking towards the horizon, cast long, dramatic shadows over the granite landscape, painting the crashing waves in hues of fiery orange and deep violet.  It was a scene begging to be captured, a symphony of color and texture that resonated deep within Amy's artistic soul.  This summer, she hoped, would finally be the one where she truly found her voice, where the vibrant landscapes of Monhegan would unlock the creative block that had plagued her for the past year.
