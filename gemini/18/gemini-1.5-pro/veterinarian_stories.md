The biting wind whipped off the Puget Sound, carrying the scent of salt and cedar, and plastered Dr. Elias Thorne’s dark hair to his forehead. He hunched deeper into his thick wool coat, squinting at the ramshackle farmhouse perched precariously on the bluff.  The porch sagged like a tired sigh, and the paint peeled off the clapboard siding like sunburnt skin.  Below, the churning grey water crashed against the rocky shore. Orcas Island in November was a raw and unforgiving beauty, and Elias, despite having lived there his entire life, still felt a prickle of unease whenever he made house calls to this remote, windswept corner of the island.  He’d received a frantic call from Mrs. Olsen about her prized Nubian goat, Beatrice, and the increasingly dire situation had pulled him away from the relative warmth of his clinic in Eastsound.  He gripped his medical bag tighter, bracing himself for whatever awaited him beyond the peeling paint and the howl of the wind.
