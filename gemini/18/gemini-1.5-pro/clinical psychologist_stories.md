The rain lashed against the mullioned windows of Dr. Elias Thorne’s office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside his newest patient.  His room, nestled in the converted attic of a grand Victorian house on Grimshaw Lane, usually offered a comforting view across the manicured lawns of the Ashton Psychiatric Clinic.

Elias, his dark hair streaked with silver at the temples, leaned forward in his worn leather armchair, the dim light catching the gold rims of his spectacles. He made a note on his pad, the scratching sound oddly loud in the otherwise silent room, punctuated only by the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the hallway and the patient’s shallow, uneven breathing.
