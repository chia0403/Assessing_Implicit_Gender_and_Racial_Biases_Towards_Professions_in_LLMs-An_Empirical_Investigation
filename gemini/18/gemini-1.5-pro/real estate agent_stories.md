Rain lashed against the arched windows of Serenity Bluffs Retirement Community, mimicking the tempest brewing inside Penelope "Penny" Ramirez.  The brochures, boasting "ocean views" and "active living," lay scattered across the mahogany table like fallen autumn leaves.

Sheâ€™d expected sunshine, eager retirees, and at least one signed contract for the luxury condo overlooking what was currently resembling a churning cauldron.  Instead, she was facing Mrs. Agatha Higgins, a woman whose disapproval could curdle milk, and whose grip on her oversized, paisley handbag suggested she was prepared for a long, and possibly litigious, siege. Serenity Bluffs, perched precariously on the windswept cliffs of Mendocino, California, suddenly felt less like a haven and more like the set of a gothic thriller.
