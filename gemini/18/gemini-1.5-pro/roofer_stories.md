He knelt on the scalding shingles of the old Victorian, sweat stinging his eyes, the city of San Francisco spread out beneath him like a crumpled velvet cloth.  The Golden Gate Bridge, usually shrouded in mist, was today a blazing orange slash against the deep blue of the bay.

He adjusted his worn leather gloves, the Bay breeze offering little respite from the oppressive heat radiating from the shingles.  This was Eliâ€™s city, every rooftop a familiar landscape, every chimney a silent sentinel in his domain.  But something about the stillness of this particular morning, the almost unnatural clarity of the air, unsettled him.
