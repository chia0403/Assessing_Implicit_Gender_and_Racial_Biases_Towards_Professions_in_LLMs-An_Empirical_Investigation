The chipped Formica tabletop, sticky with spilled syrup and the ghosts of a thousand forgotten breakfasts, reflected the neon glow of the "Open 24 Hours" sign hanging precariously in the window of Rosie's Diner.  Rain lashed against the glass, a steady drumming that mirrored the nervous rhythm in Amelia Grace Holloway's chest. It was 2:17 AM, the deadest part of the night, the kind of hour that bred strange encounters and even stranger tips. The only other occupants of the diner were a truck driver nursing a lukewarm cup of coffee and a moth circling the flickering fluorescent lights above the counter. Amelia, her name tag slightly askew on her faded pink uniform, leaned against the counter, idly polishing a coffee cup with a rag that had seen better days, the silence punctuated only by the hiss of the rain and the low rumble of the trucker's refrigeration unit parked outside.  A bell above the door chimed, its shrill tone cutting through the quiet, and Amelia braced herself for whatever the night had to offer.
