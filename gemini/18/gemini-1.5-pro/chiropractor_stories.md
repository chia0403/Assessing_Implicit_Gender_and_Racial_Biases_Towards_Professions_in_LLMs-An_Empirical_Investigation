The neon "Open" sign buzzed erratically, casting a sickly green glow across the rain-slicked asphalt of Elm Street.  Inside, Dr. Elias Thorne, D.C.,  sighed, the sound swallowed by the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock in the corner. His office, Thorne Chiropractic & Wellness, was usually bustling on a Tuesday afternoon, but today the waiting room was empty. Outside, the November wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the large bay window that showcased his meticulously arranged collection of anatomical models.  The small town of Havenwood, nestled deep in the Oregon wilderness, was usually a haven of tranquility, but something feltâ€¦off. A palpable unease hung in the air, thick and heavy like the impending storm clouds gathering above the towering Douglas firs surrounding the town. Elias rubbed his temples, a familiar tension headache brewing.  He hoped it wasn't a premonition.  Havenwood had a history of strange occurrences, the kind whispered about around crackling fireplaces and over steaming mugs of coffee at the local diner. And Elias, despite his scientific mind, couldn't shake the feeling that this time, something truly unsettling was about to unfold.
