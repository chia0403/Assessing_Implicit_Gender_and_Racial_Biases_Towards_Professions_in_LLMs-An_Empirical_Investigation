The fluorescent lights of Northwood High School hummed a monotonous B-flat, a soundtrack to Dr. Elias Thorne’s Tuesday morning. Rain lashed against the windows of his small, cluttered office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside him.  Elias, whose crisp, ironed shirt and meticulously combed hair usually projected an image of calm control, felt the familiar knot of anxiety tighten in his stomach. This was the day the new student, Michael Finch, was supposed to arrive, a boy shrouded in whispers of troubled behavior and a deeply unsettling incident at his previous school. Northwood, nestled in the sleepy, orchard-dotted hills of western Massachusetts, wasn't accustomed to such disturbances. The scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, usually a comfort to Elias, today felt heavy with foreboding.  His office, a converted storage closet crammed with dusty filing cabinets, dog-eared psychology textbooks, and a perpetually overflowing in-tray, suddenly felt less like a sanctuary and more like a cage. He glanced at the clock: 8:57 AM.  Three minutes until Michael Finch walked through the door and into Elias’s carefully constructed world.
