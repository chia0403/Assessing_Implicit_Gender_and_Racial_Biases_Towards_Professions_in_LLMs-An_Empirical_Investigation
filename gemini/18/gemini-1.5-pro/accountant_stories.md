Rain lashed against the ornate, bay window of Elias Thorne's office, blurring the already fading light of a November afternoon in London. Elias, a meticulous accountant with a penchant for perfectly aligned paperclips and a quiet life, tapped a rhythmic beat on his mahogany desk with a pristine Parker pen. His office, nestled above a bustling flower market on Portobello Road, usually offered a comforting aroma of lilies and roses, but today, the petrichor of rain dominated. The rhythmic clicking of the vintage clock on the mantelpiece, a gift from his late grandmother, usually soothed him, but today, it felt like a relentless countdown. He glanced at the leather-bound ledger in front of him, the numbers swimming before his tired eyes.  He'd been poring over the accounts of "Blooms & Butterflies," the flower shop below, for weeks, and something wasn't adding up. It wasn't a large discrepancy, not enough to raise any serious flags, but just enough to prick at his usually unflappable composure. Elias Thorne believed in order, in balance, and these books were anything but.
