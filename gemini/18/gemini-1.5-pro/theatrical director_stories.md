The biting November wind whipped around Anastasia “Ana” Petrova Volkov, swirling fallen leaves into miniature tornadoes around her ankles.  She pulled her burgundy beret further down, shielding her ears as she surveyed the dilapidated Majestic Theatre.  Chipped paint peeled from the ornate facade like sunburnt skin, and one of the cherubic statues perched precariously above the marquee had lost its head, leaving a rusty metal spike jutting into the grey London sky.  Ana, however, saw none of the decay.  She saw potential.  She saw the ghosts of past performances whispering in the dusty corners.  She saw, with the laser-sharp vision only a seasoned theatrical director possessed, the vibrant, pulsating heart of a sleeping giant, waiting for her touch to awaken it. This was where she would stage her adaptation of Chekhov's *The Cherry Orchard*, and it would be unlike anything London had ever seen.
