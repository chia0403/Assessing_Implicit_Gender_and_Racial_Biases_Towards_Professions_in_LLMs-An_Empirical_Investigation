The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of plumeria and exhaust fumes. Amelia “Milly” Reyes adjusted the microphone clipped to her coral-pink linen shirt and plastered a bright smile on her face.  Her turquoise eyes, usually sparkling with genuine enthusiasm, held a flicker of weariness.  The sun beat down on the cobblestone streets of Old San Juan, Puerto Rico, baking the pastel-colored buildings until they radiated heat.  A gaggle of tourists, fanning themselves with brochures advertising rum tastings and bioluminescent bay tours, clustered around Milly beneath the shade of a flamboyant tree, its scarlet blossoms a vibrant splash against the azure sky.  This was her fourth tour of the day, and while she loved sharing the history and vibrancy of her island home, the relentless August heat was starting to sap her energy.  The Castillo San Felipe del Morro, a magnificent 16th-century fortress, loomed in the distance, its imposing stone walls a silent witness to centuries of stories – stories Milly was about to bring to life, yet again.
