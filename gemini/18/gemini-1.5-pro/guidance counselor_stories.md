The fluorescent lights of Northwood High hummed a monotonous B flat, a soundtrack to Eleanor Vanceâ€™s Tuesday morning. Rain lashed against the window of her office, blurring the already muted colours of the late October landscape.  Crimson and gold leaves, usually vibrant against the brickwork of the school building, were now sodden and plastered to the ground. Eleanor, her auburn hair pulled back in a loose braid, tapped a chipped mug of lukewarm tea against the edge of her overflowing in-tray.  The smell of damp wool and teenage angst permeated the small room, a familiar aroma that had clung to the air for the past seventeen years of her career. Northwood, nestled in the heart of the sleepy, forested town of Hemlock Creek, Oregon, wasn't known for its academic rigour or its thriving social scene.  It was a place where secrets festered beneath a veneer of placid normality, and Eleanor, often the unwilling confidante, held more of them than she cared to admit. This Tuesday, however, promised to be different.  A new student was arriving, a transfer from the notoriously troubled Blackwood Academy, and Eleanor had a feeling the quiet routine of Hemlock Creek was about to be shattered.
