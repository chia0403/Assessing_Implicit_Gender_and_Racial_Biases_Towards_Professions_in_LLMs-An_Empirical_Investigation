The biting wind whipped at Captain Evangeline "Eva" Moreau's flight suit as she prepped the Havilland DHC-2 Beaver for takeoff.  Sleet lashed against the cockpit window, obscuring the desolate landscape of the Northwest Territories.  Pine trees, heavy with snow, bowed low under the weight, forming a jagged, frosted perimeter around the small, ice-encrusted airstrip.  Yellowknife, the nearest semblance of civilization, was a speck on the map, a distant 200 miles south.  Eva's breath fogged the glass as she checked the fuel gauge one last time, the pungent scent of aviation fuel mixing with the crisp, icy air.  This was her third supply run this week to the remote mining outpost nestled deep in the unforgiving expanse of the Canadian wilderness, and the worsening weather had her on edge.  This wasn't just another routine flight; this one felt different.  A prickling unease settled in her stomach, a feeling she'd learned to trust over her years navigating the treacherous northern skies.
