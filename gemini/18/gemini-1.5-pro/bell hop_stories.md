The revolving doors of the Grand Majestic Hotel whispered a sigh of warm, jasmine-scented air onto the bustling Chicago street.  Rain slicked the sidewalks, reflecting the neon glow of a nearby jazz club. Inside, the lobby shimmered with polished marble and the low hum of conversations punctuated by the tinkling of ice in crystal glasses.  This was Bartholomew "Barty" Finch's domain.  He stood, ramrod straight despite the slight ache in his lower back, beneath the gargantuan crystal chandelier, his pillbox hat perched perfectly upon his head. His uniform, a pristine burgundy with gold braiding, was immaculate, even down to the gleaming brass buttons.  Tonight, the eve of the infamous Scarlatti Diamond auction, the Grand Majestic was abuzz with an electric anticipation Barty had never witnessed in his five years of service.  Something felt different, charged in the air, like the quiet before a summer storm. He adjusted his white gloves, a nervous flutter in his stomach, for tonight he wasn't just a bellhop; he was a silent observer, a keeper of secrets in a world of glittering facades and hidden agendas.
