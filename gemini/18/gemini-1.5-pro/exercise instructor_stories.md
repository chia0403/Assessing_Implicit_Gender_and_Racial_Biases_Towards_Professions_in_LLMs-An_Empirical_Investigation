The relentless Miami sun beat down on Ocean Drive, turning the turquoise water into a shimmering mirage.  Palm trees swayed rhythmically, offering little respite from the heat.  Inside the air-conditioned sanctuary of "Body By Beatriz," sweat dripped onto the polished wood floor, a testament to the high-energy Zumba class in full swing.  Beatriz "Bea" Rodriguez, her dark hair pulled back in a high ponytail, moved with the grace of a jungle cat, her vibrant energy infectious.  Latin rhythms pulsed through the room, driving the class to push harder, reach further, and shake off the stresses of the day.  But Bea's smile, usually as bright as the hibiscus flowers blooming outside, held a hint of strain.  Something was different today.  The usual joy she found in leading her class was muted, overshadowed by a nagging feeling that something was about to change.  And not for the better.
