The biting wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s auburn braid across her face as she adjusted the tripod on the precipice of Cadarn Fawr, a hulking, slate-grey mountain that dominated the Snowdonia landscape.  Low, bruised clouds clung to the peaks like damp wool, spitting intermittent sleet that stung Amelia’s exposed cheeks. Below her, the valley floor, a patchwork of sheep-dotted fields and stone-walled farms, was swallowed by a churning mist, its details obscured like a half-remembered dream.  Amelia, clad in a thick, waxed canvas jacket and sturdy hiking boots, ignored the gnawing cold and focused her lens on the swirling drama unfolding before her.  This was exactly the kind of atmospheric shot she'd been chasing for months – a visceral representation of the untamed beauty that drew her to these rugged Welsh hills. This photo, she hoped, would be the centerpiece of her upcoming exhibition, "Whispers of the Wild."
