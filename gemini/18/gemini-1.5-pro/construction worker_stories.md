The biting November wind whipped across the skeletal steel frame of the "One Meridian Plaza," whistling a lonely tune through the girders. Forty-two stories above the churning grey waters of Lake Michigan, Elias "Eli" Vance tightened the strap of his hard hat and spat a stream of tobacco juice that was immediately snatched away by the wind.

The air was thick with the metallic scent of welding and the earthy tang of freshly poured concrete.  A half-finished crane loomed over Eli like a metal praying mantis, its long arm pointing accusingly at the bruised, pre-dawn sky.  He shifted his weight on the narrow steel beam, the worn leather of his work boots gripping the ridged metal, and surveyed the work site.
