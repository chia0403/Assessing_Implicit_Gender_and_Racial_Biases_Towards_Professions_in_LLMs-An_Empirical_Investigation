The bell above the door of "Petal & Plume" jingled merrily, a counterpoint to the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of Eliza Jane Wilder's shears.  Outside, the Charleston, South Carolina, air hung thick and humid, the scent of jasmine and pluff mud drifting in on the breeze. Inside, the small shop was a riot of controlled chaos. Buckets overflowing with hydrangeas in shades of blush pink and periwinkle blue lined the walls, while the worktable held a half-finished arrangement of vibrant sunflowers and delicate Queen Anne’s lace. Eliza, her auburn braid draped over one shoulder, meticulously trimmed the thorns from a clutch of long-stemmed red roses, her brow furrowed in concentration.  Sunlight streamed through the large storefront window, illuminating the swirling dust motes dancing in the air and casting a warm glow on the antique brass watering can perched precariously on a stack of vintage gardening books.  The air buzzed with the promise of a typical sweltering summer day, but inside Petal & Plume, a different kind of heat was brewing – the kind that comes with a secret.
