A cryptic phone call, a whispered tip about something "strange" happening out at the old Blackwood Manor, had ignited a flicker of excitement in Mia's otherwise weary soul. Blackwood Manor, shrouded in local legend and rumored to be haunted, had stood empty for decades, a crumbling testament to a forgotten era. Tonight, according to her anonymous source, it was alive again.
