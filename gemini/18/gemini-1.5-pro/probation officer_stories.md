The fluorescent lights of the Albany County Probation Office hummed a monotonous B flat, a soundtrack to Eleanor Vanceâ€™s Tuesday morning. Rain hammered against the grime-streaked windows, blurring the already bleak view of the parking lot below. Eleanor, her dark hair pinned back in a severe knot, tapped away at her keyboard, the rhythmic clicks a counterpoint to the incessant drumming of the rain.  Files, thick with the transgressions and fragile promises of her clients, stacked precariously on her desk, threatening to topple like a Jenga tower built by a shaky hand. The air hung heavy with the stale scent of instant coffee and the faint, metallic tang of desperation that clung to everyone who entered this building, both probationer and officer alike.  This particular Tuesday, five days before Christmas, promised to be no different from the rest, a bleak tableau of broken lives and flickering hopes. Eleanor, however, had a nagging feeling in the pit of her stomach, a premonition as grey and persistent as the Albany sky, that this week was about to deliver something far more complicated than usual.
