The biting wind whipped across the Pembrokeshire coast, carrying the salty tang of the Irish Sea and the mournful cry of gulls.  Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the seabird sanctuary, a cacophony that echoed through the cluttered, brightly-painted treatment room.

Amelia, her brow furrowed in concentration, gently probed the delicate bones, her touch as light as the seafoam that kissed the nearby cliffs. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sterile glow over the otherwise chaotic space, crammed with cages, medical supplies, and half-eaten fish.  Outside, the storm raged on, mirroring the turmoil brewing within Amelia as she fought to save the tiny creatureâ€™s life.
