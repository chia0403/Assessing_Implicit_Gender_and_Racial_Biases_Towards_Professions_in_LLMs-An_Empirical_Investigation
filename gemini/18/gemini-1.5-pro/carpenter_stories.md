The biting wind whipped off the slate-grey waters of Lake Superior, carrying the scent of pine and impending snow.  Sawdust clung to Elias Thorne's thick wool coat, glittering like tiny diamonds in the fading afternoon light. He squinted, his breath clouding the air as he surveyed his latest project: a two-story boathouse, perched precariously on the rocky shoreline of Apostle Island. The November sky, bruised purple and gunmetal grey, threatened to unleash the first blizzard of the season. Elias, his calloused hands raw despite the thick leather gloves, adjusted the heavy timber frame, the wood groaning in protest under the strain. This was his life: coaxing beauty and function from the stubborn heart of nature, one nail, one beam, one perfectly measured cut at a time.  Isolated and self-sufficient, he thrived in the quiet solitude of the island, a tiny speck of land miles from the Wisconsin mainland. But the approaching storm held a promise of something more than just snow.  A unease, a prickling at the edge of his awareness, whispered that this winter would be unlike any other.
