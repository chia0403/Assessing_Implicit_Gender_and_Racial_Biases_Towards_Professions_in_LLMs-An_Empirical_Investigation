The stale, recirculated air of the Denver International Airport hummed a low C-sharp, a counterpoint to the incessant rolling thunder of luggage wheels. Amelia “Amy” Reyes, a pharmaceutical sales representative for NovaMed Pharmaceuticals, adjusted the strap of her laptop bag, a familiar ache blossoming in her right shoulder.  The vast, white-tented roof of the Jeppesen Terminal loomed above her, a stark contrast to the bruised purple of the approaching Colorado thunderstorm. Amy checked her watch – 5:47 pm.  She was late. Again. This time, the delay wasn't her fault – a mechanical issue had grounded her flight out of Chicago for three agonizing hours. But Dr. Alistair Finch, head of cardiology at Denver General and her most important prospective client, wouldn't care about excuses. He was notorious for his punctuality and disdain for those who lacked it.  Amy's heels clicked against the polished floor as she hurried towards the baggage claim, the weight of her quota, and the storm clouds gathering outside, mirroring the anxiety churning in her stomach.
