The clatter of pots and the sizzle of garlic in olive oil were the morning song of Evangeline "Evie" Moreau. Her kitchen, a small but fiercely organized space tucked in the back of "Le Papillon Bleu," hummed with the energy of impending creation.  Dawn light, filtered through the dusty windowpanes above a riot of potted herbs, painted stripes across the worn wooden countertops. Le Papillon Bleu, nestled in the heart of the Vieux Carr√© in New Orleans, wasn't much to look at from the outside.  Its faded turquoise paint peeled like sunburnt skin, and the wrought iron balcony sagged with the weight of years and blooming jasmine.  But inside, Evie ruled her culinary domain with a quiet confidence, coaxing magic from the simplest of ingredients. Today, the magic was destined for the annual "Taste of the Quarter" festival, a competition Evie had yet to win, but planned to conquer this year with her grandmother's secret gumbo recipe.
