The biting wind whipped across the frost-covered fields of Abalone Creek Farm, catching the edges of Elias Thorne's worn wool coat and tugging at it like an impatient child.  Sunrise, a pale smear of apricot behind the jagged peaks of the Sentinel Mountains, offered little warmth against the December chill. Elias, his breath clouding in the frigid air, adjusted his thick leather gloves and surveyed his land.  Abalone Creek, normally a gurgling ribbon of life bisecting the property, was now a sluggish, half-frozen serpent, its banks dusted with a fine layer of snow.  The barns and outbuildings huddled together against the wind, their weathered wooden sides groaning in protest.  This year, winter had arrived early in the small valley, clamping its icy grip on everything in its path, and Elias knew, deep in his bones, it would be a long, hard season.
