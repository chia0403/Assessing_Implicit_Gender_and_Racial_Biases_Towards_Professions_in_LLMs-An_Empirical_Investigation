The biting November wind whipped around Eleanor Vance, plastering stray strands of auburn hair across her lipstick-smudged cheek.  She tugged her cashmere scarf tighter, the buttery soft fabric a small comfort against the grey, unforgiving sky above. Eleanor, whose full name was Eleanor Beatrice Vance, surveyed the imposing Victorian mansion looming before her, its brick fa√ßade darkened by years of weathering and neglect.  Wisteria, long since withered, clung to the wrought-iron balconies like skeletal fingers.  Ravenwood Manor, as it was rather dramatically named, sat perched atop a windswept hill overlooking the churning waters of the Bristol Channel.  The air, thick with the scent of salt and decay, hinted at the damp, echoing rooms that awaited her within.  This was her latest project, a daunting restoration commissioned by the reclusive new owner, a Mr. Silas Blackwood.  Eleanor, usually unflappable, felt a shiver of unease, a premonition that Ravenwood Manor held more than just peeling wallpaper and dusty chandeliers.
