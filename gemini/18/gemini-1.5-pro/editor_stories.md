The wind howled louder, mimicking the turmoil brewing within her.  This was supposed to be her escape, a quiet retreat where she could lose herself in the worlds created by other writers.  But Tregenna, with its windswept cliffs and hidden coves, held a secret that threatened to unravel the carefully constructed peace she had so painstakingly woven around herself.
