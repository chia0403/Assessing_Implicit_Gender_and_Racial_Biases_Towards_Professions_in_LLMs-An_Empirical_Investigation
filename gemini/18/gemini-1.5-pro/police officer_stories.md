The relentless drizzle clung to the cobbled streets of Arkham, Massachusetts, reflecting the neon glow of the few businesses still open at this ungodly hour.  A thick fog, the kind that seemed to seep into your bones and chill you from the inside out, rolled in from the churning black expanse of the North Atlantic, obscuring the already decaying Victorian architecture. Detective Isabella “Izzy” Diaz shivered, pulling her threadbare coat tighter around her as she surveyed the scene. Yellow crime scene tape flapped listlessly in the breeze, cordoning off a small alleyway between a dusty antique shop and a boarded-up bookstore. The flickering gas lamp above cast long, distorted shadows that danced with the fog, giving the impression of movement where there was none.  The air was heavy with the metallic tang of blood, mingling with the salty sea air and the faint, sickly sweet odor of decay.  This was Izzy’s third homicide this month, and something about this one felt…different.  Worse.
