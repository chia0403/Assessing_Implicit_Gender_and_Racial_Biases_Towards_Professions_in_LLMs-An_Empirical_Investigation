The biting November wind whipped at Elias Finchâ€™s thick wool coat, sending fallen sycamore leaves swirling around his worn leather boots.  Grey clouds, heavy with the promise of snow, scudded low across the sky, casting a melancholic pall over the sprawling grounds of Blackwood Manor.  Elias, head groundskeeper for the past twenty years, surveyed his domain with a practiced eye. The formal gardens, once vibrant with summer blooms, now stood skeletal and dormant, their intricate boxwood hedges frosted with a delicate layer of ice. The great oak at the edge of the property, its branches reaching skyward like gnarled fingers, groaned under the weight of the wind.  Blackwood Manor itself, a brooding Victorian mansion of dark stone and shadowed windows, loomed over the landscape, a silent sentinel against the encroaching gloom.  It was a place of secrets, whispered about by the townsfolk in hushed tones, and Elias, in his quiet solitude, had become the keeper of those secrets, along with the grounds themselves.
