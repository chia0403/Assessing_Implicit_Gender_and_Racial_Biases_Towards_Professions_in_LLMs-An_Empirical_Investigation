The chipped turquoise paint on the door of "Curl Up & Dye" jingled merrily as Esmeralda "Esme" Rodriguez unlocked it, the Florida sun already beating down on the dusty strip mall in Kissimmee. The air, thick with the promise of a sweltering afternoon, hung heavy, even at 7:30 am. Inside, the salon was cool and dim, the only illumination coming from the flickering neon "Open" sign Esme had forgotten to turn off the night before. Rows of brightly coloured bottles lined the mirrored walls, promising transformations and temporary escapes.  The air smelled faintly of bleach and coconut oil, a comforting, familiar scent that Esme associated with hard work and the quiet satisfaction of making people feel beautiful. Today, however, a knot of unease twisted in her stomach. It wasn't just the oppressive humidity; something else feltâ€¦ off.
