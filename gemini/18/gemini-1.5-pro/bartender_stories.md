The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of O'Malley's, a rhythm echoed by the steady drip from a leaky pipe somewhere near the back. Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of stale beer, cheap whiskey, and regret.  Neon signs advertising long-defunct breweries cast a sickly yellow glow across the room, illuminating dust motes dancing in the otherwise dim light.  A single, bare bulb illuminated the long mahogany bar, where Elias "Eli" Blackwood polished glasses with a practiced hand, his face etched with the weariness of a man who'd seen too much and heard even more.  O'Malley's, nestled between a pawn shop and a boarded-up bookstore in the heart of Hollow Creek, Indiana, wasn't much, but it was Eli's domain, a sanctuary of sorts in a town that had forgotten how to dream.  Tonight, however, the quiet hum of a typical Tuesday night was about to be shattered.
