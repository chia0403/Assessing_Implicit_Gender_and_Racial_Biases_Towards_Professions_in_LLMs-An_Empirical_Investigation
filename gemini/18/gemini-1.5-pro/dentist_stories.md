The chipped porcelain flamingo, perched precariously on the edge of Dr. Elias Thorne's desk, seemed to wobble in the perpetual Florida humidity.  Elias, sweat beading on his upper lip despite the arctic chill blasting from the air conditioning unit, adjusted his loupes and sighed. The flamingo, a gift from a particularly grateful (and eccentric) patient, Mrs. Periwinkle, had become an unofficial barometer of his stress levels. The more it wobbled, the worse his day was going. Today, it looked as though it might take flight. His office, nestled in a pastel-pink Spanish Revival building on Coral Gables' Miracle Mile, usually radiated a soothing, vaguely tropical vibe. Today, however, the vibrant bougainvillea climbing the wrought-iron balcony outside seemed to mock the oppressive tension within. It was only 9:00 am, and already Elias was dreading the root canal scheduled for Mrs. Rodriguez, a woman known throughout the practice for her dramatic pronouncements of discomfort and uncanny ability to find fault with even the perfectly polished gleam of his waiting room's terrazzo floor.
