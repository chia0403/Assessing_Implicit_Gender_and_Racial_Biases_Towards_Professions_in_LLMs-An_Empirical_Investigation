The biting wind whipped around Professor Alistair Finch, swirling the fallen leaves of a particularly vibrant maple into a frenzied dance across the cobbled courtyard of St. Judeâ€™s College, Oxford.  Rain, fine and persistent, plastered his tweed jacket to his thin frame, and he shivered, pulling his threadbare scarf tighter around his neck. It was late November, the kind of damp, bone-chilling evening that seeped into the very stones of the ancient university.  The light from the gas lamps lining the walkway cast long, dancing shadows, making the gargoyles perched atop the surrounding buildings seem almost animate. Alistair, clutching a battered leather satchel overflowing with student essays, hurried towards his rooms, the rhythmic click of his heels echoing in the otherwise deserted quad.  He dreamt of a warm fire, a glass of sherry, and the blessed silence that would allow him to delve back into his latest research on the esoteric symbolism of medieval bestiaries.  Little did he know, the silence he craved was about to be shattered.
