The insistent Vermont wind rattled the leaded glass panes of Dr. Finch’s dental practice, whistling a melancholic tune that echoed the unease swirling in Eleanor Vance’s stomach.  Snow, fine and relentless, had been falling since dawn, blanketing the quaint town of Maple Creek in a pristine, yet oppressive, silence.  Inside, the sterile fluorescent lights hummed, a stark contrast to the swirling grey outside.  Eleanor, her name tag pinned neatly to her crisp white uniform, fidgeted with the ultrasonic scaler, the metallic chill of it unwelcome against her palm.  It was a Tuesday, typically a busy day, but the relentless snow had kept most patients tucked away in their cozy homes.  The only sound other than the wind and the hum of the lights was the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the waiting room, each tick a reminder of the unsettling quiet and the gnawing feeling that something wasn't right.  Eleanor had lived in Maple Creek her entire life, a life interwoven with the rhythms of this small town, and today, that rhythm felt jarringly off-key.
