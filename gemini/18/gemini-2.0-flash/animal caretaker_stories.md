## Story Opening:

The screech ripped through the pre-dawn quiet, a sound so raw and primal it rattled Eliza Mae Bartholomew down to her worn-out, mud-caked boots. She spilled the steaming mug of Earl Grey she'd been nursing against the chill, the hot liquid scalding her fingers, but she barely registered the pain. That screech – *that* was Artemis. And Artemis only shrieked like that when something was very, very wrong. Eliza grabbed the heavy-duty flashlight she kept permanently by the back door and plunged into the oppressive darkness, her heart hammering against her ribs like a trapped bird. "Artemis! I'm coming, girl!" she yelled, her voice a thin thread against the thick cloak of the night.

## Setting:

Eliza Mae Bartholomew lived and worked at "Sanctuary of Whispers," a sprawling, if somewhat dilapidated, wildlife rehabilitation center nestled deep in the heart of the Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina. The Sanctuary was a patchwork affair, a testament to Eliza's tireless efforts and meager funding. Fenced enclosures, built with a combination of salvaged wood and donated chicken wire, housed a rotating cast of injured and orphaned animals – everything from screech owls with broken wings to timid fawns separated from their mothers.

The main house, a weather-beaten two-story farmhouse that had belonged to her grandparents, served as Eliza's living quarters, office, and makeshift infirmary. The air inside perpetually smelled of disinfectant, woodsmoke, and the earthy scent of the animals she cared for. Outside, the rugged terrain sloped down towards a fast-flowing creek, providing a natural boundary and a constant source of fresh water. The surrounding forest, dense with towering pines and ancient oaks, was both a sanctuary for the creatures she sought to protect and a constant reminder of the dangers they faced in the human world. Sanctuary of Whispers wasn't glamorous, but it was home, and it was where Eliza Mae Bartholomew felt most alive.
