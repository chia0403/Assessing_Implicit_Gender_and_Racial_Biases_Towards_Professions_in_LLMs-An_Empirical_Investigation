Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring an emergency medical care provider:

**Setting:** The biting wind howled off Lake Michigan, whipping snow into a frenzied dance around the entrance of the 'Ripple Effect' - a popular, if questionably maintained, nightclub clinging to the edge of Chicago's Navy Pier. Neon light flickered spasmodically from the club's sign, casting an unsteady, garish glow across the icy pavement. Inside, the bass pulsed, a dull throb that vibrated even through the thick EMS boots.

**Opening:**

The screech of tires sliced through the pulsating throb of the nightclub's music as an ambulance pulled up abruptly to the curb.  The rear doors swung open and Elara Jane Kendrick, a name she hadn’t earned overnight,  practically fell out, bracing herself against the slick ice. The wind caught her breath, stinging her exposed cheeks.

"Possible OD, ETA five minutes," the dispatcher’s voice crackle over her radio,  "Subject unresponsive, bystanders administering CPR.  Ripple Effect, Navy Pier."

Elara yanked her medical bag free of the ambulance. "Let's go, Jones," she barked to her partner, a hulking man who somehow managed to look perpetually unflappable.  "Showtime."

He nodded, already halfway to the door.  Elara, however, paused for a fraction of a second. The Ripple Effect.  She knew the place's reputation.  Cheap drinks, loud music, and a clientele that tended towards the chaotic.  It was exactly the kind of place where things went wrong.  And tonight, things had already gone very wrong for someone. She took a deep breath, steeling herself. This was Chicago, and she was here to make it better. She just needed to get to the patient before it was too late.
