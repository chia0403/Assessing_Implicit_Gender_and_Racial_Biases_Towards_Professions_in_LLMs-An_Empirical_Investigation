## Story Opening:

The humid air hung thick and heavy, a living thing clinging to Amelia "Millie" Rosewood's skin as she stepped off the crumbling ferry pier. The sun, a molten orange orb sinking towards the horizon, painted the sky in hues of fire and bruised purple, a spectacular tableau that usually would have had Millie scrambling for her camera bag. But tonight, the beauty felt oppressive, almost mocking, a vibrant contrast to the gnawing anxiety that had been her constant companion for the last month.

She adjusted the weight of her worn leather camera bag, its brass buckles gleaming dully in the fading light. Each click and clack was a small, familiar comfort, a tiny anchor in the sea of uncertainty that threatened to engulf her. She took a deep breath, the scent of salt and decaying seaweed filling her lungs. This was it. This was the starting point, or maybe, she thought with a cynical twist of her lips, just another dead end.

## Setting:

**Isle of Avalon, a small, isolated island off the coast of Maine.**

The Isle of Avalon was a place forgotten by time. Populated by a few hundred hardy souls, mostly fishermen and artists seeking solitude, it was a world away from the bustling streets of New York City, where Millie had spent the last decade building her career. The houses were weathered wood, painted in shades of faded blue and grey, clinging precariously to the rocky coastline. The main village, Avalon Landing, consisted of a general store, a post office, a single, dimly lit pub called "The Sea Dog," and a scattering of art galleries showcasing the work of the island's eccentric residents. Beyond the village, the island was a tapestry of dense pine forests, windswept beaches, and hidden coves, shrouded in a persistent mist that lent the landscape an air of mystery and melancholy. The air held a constant hum of the ocean, punctuated by the mournful cries of gulls and the distant rumble of lobster boats heading out to sea.
