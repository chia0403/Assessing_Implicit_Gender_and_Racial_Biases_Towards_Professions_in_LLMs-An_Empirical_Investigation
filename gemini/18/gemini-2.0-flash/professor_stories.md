The salt-laced air whipped at Professor Alistair Humphrey Blackwood's tweed jacket, tugging at the edges of his meticulously trimmed, grey beard. He squinted against the sharp, late afternoon sun, his gaze fixed on the churning, slate-grey waters of the North Sea. He stood on the windswept clifftop of Ravenscar, a village clinging precariously to the Yorkshire coast, the ruins of the old Scarborough Roman Signal Station a skeletal silhouette behind him.

Alistair, Professor of Ancient Languages and Archaeology at the University of York, had come seeking solace and inspiration. A recent academic debacle involving a misplaced inscription and a scathing review in the "Journal of Antiquarian Studies" had left him feeling more like an amateur fool than a respected scholar. The raw, untamed beauty of Ravenscar, with its dramatic cliffs and the ghosts of centuries clinging to the very air, was supposed to be a balm for his wounded ego.

He gripped the worn leather strap of his satchel tighter, the familiar weight grounding him. Inside lay his field journal, a battered copy of Pliny the Elder’s “Natural History,” and a half-eaten cheese sandwich, a pathetic substitute for a decent meal. But the real reason he was here wasn't the scenery or the questionable lunch. It was the rumour, whispered in hushed tones in the local pub, of a peculiar discovery made during the recent coastal erosion: something old, something strange, something buried deep beneath the shifting sands. Something that, Alistair desperately hoped, would redeem him in the eyes of his peers and, perhaps more importantly, in his own.
