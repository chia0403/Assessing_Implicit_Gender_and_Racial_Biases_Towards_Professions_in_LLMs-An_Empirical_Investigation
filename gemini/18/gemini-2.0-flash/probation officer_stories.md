Okay, here's a story opening, setting, and full name of the main character, a probation officer:

**Opening:**

The sickly sweet smell of stale cinnamon rolls clung to the air in the Northwood County Probation Office, a scent Beatrice Anya Moreau had grown to associate with desperation and bad decisions. It was Monday morning, and the communal breakroom, usually buzzing with gossip and lukewarm coffee, was eerily quiet. Beatrice sipped her own black, unsweetened coffee, the bitter liquid a necessary jolt to face the mountain of files stacked precariously on her desk, each representing a life teetering on the edge. Outside, the November sky was a bruised purple, threatening snow that would undoubtedly make her commute even more treacherous. She knew, without looking, that at least three of her charges would call in with "car trouble" by lunchtime, hoping to postpone their mandatory check-in. Beatrice sighed, the sound barely audible above the hum of the fluorescent lights. Today felt like a particularly heavy day, a premonition clinging to her like the lingering scent of those goddamn cinnamon rolls.

**Setting:**

The Northwood County Probation Office is located in a nondescript, single-story brick building on the outskirts of the small, rust-belt town of Havenwood, Pennsylvania. It's a building that screams of budgetary constraints and weary bureaucracy. The interior is a maze of cramped cubicles separated by worn, grey fabric dividers. Fluorescent lights buzz overhead, casting a harsh, unflattering glow on the faded paint and dated furniture. The breakroom, mentioned in the opening, is a small, perpetually messy space with a perpetually broken coffee machine, a microwave that smells faintly of burnt popcorn, and a bulletin board covered in outdated motivational posters and notices about mandatory diversity training. The overall atmosphere is one of quiet desperation, a constant low-level hum of anxiety and the faint scent of despair. Outside, the building is surrounded by a cracked asphalt parking lot and a scraggly lawn, a visual representation of the limited resources available to the county's social services.

**Main Character:**

Beatrice Anya Moreau
