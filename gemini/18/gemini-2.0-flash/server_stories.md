## Opening:

The clatter of silverware against china was a symphony of barely controlled chaos, a sound Amelia Rose Hawthorne had grown to both despise and depend on. She could pick out the distinct note of Mrs. Gable's demanding tap for more water, the hesitant scrape of young Timmy Spillane's fork as he nervously navigated his spaghetti, and even the rhythmic clinking that signaled old Mr. Henderson was meticulously arranging his salt and pepper shakers. Tonight, however, the symphony was discordant, off-key. A high-pitched, almost frantic, note had been added – the shrill laughter emanating from Table Twelve. Amelia, balancing a tray laden with steaming plates of chicken pot pie, braced herself. Table Twelve meant trouble, always.

## Setting:

"The Willow Creek Diner," a landmark in the sleepy town of Havenwood, Vermont, was a monument to comfort food and predictable routine. Housed in a charmingly dilapidated building with a peeling paint job and a neon sign that flickered precariously, it had been a fixture in Havenwood for over sixty years. Inside, mismatched vinyl booths lined the perimeter, their worn cushions bearing the ghosts of countless meals. The walls were adorned with vintage travel posters depicting a romanticized version of Vermont, a stark contrast to the reality of mud season and long, unforgiving winters. A long, Formica counter stretched along one side, perpetually sticky despite Amelia's best efforts, fronted by swivel stools upholstered in cracking red vinyl. The air was thick with the aroma of frying bacon, strong coffee, and the ever-present scent of Mrs. Higgins’ apple pie, baking in the ancient, rumbling oven in the back. The diner was a haven for locals, truckers passing through, and the occasional tourist seeking a taste of authentic Americana, a place where gossip flowed freely and the same stories were told and re-told nightly.
