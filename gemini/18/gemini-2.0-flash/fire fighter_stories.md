The biting wind howled a discordant symphony through the skeletal branches of the ancient oak that dominated the corner of Juniper and Elm. It was a wind that promised snow, and Elias Thorne, his face ruddy with the cold, tasted it in the air as he stared up at the flickering Christmas lights strung precariously across Mrs. Gable's porch roof. He'd been called out, yet again, for a hazard inspection. Mrs. Gable, bless her heart, was a whirlwind of tinsel and faulty wiring this time of year.

Elias, officially designated as Firefighter Elias Thorne of the Willow Creek Volunteer Fire Department, sighed, the condensation puffing out into the frigid night. Willow Creek, nestled deep in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, wasn't exactly a hotbed of infernos. Mostly, it was chimney fires, unattended bonfires, and the aforementioned, and alarmingly frequent, festive malfunctions courtesy of its more eccentric residents.

Tonight, though, the usual holiday cheer felt thin, replaced by a prickling unease he couldnâ€™t quite place. It wasn't just the wind. It was something else, something lurking just beneath the surface of the twinkling, deceptively peaceful scene, like a simmering ember waiting for the right spark.
