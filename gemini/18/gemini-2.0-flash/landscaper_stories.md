The humid Georgia air hung heavy, thick enough to choke a rose bush. Thomas Edward Ashton, more commonly known as Tom, wiped a bead of sweat from his brow with the back of his forearm, leaving a streak of soil behind. He stood knee-deep in a bed of crimson salvia, meticulously spacing the plants according to his planting guide. The air vibrated with the incessant hum of cicadas, a constant drone punctuated only by the snip of his pruning shears.

His setting: the sprawling, meticulously manicured grounds of "Magnolia Belle," a sprawling antebellum mansion just outside Savannah. The white columns gleamed in the harsh afternoon sun, their grandeur a silent testament to a bygone era. Gravel pathways crunched underfoot, leading past symmetrical rows of boxwoods sculpted into perfect spheres and fountains that gurgled with pristine water. Each blade of grass was precisely the same height, each flower perfectly positioned. It was a landscape of controlled beauty, a stark contrast to the wild, untamed marshlands that stretched just beyond the property line. Tom had been working for the Oglethorpe family, the owners of Magnolia Belle, for five years now, and though he appreciated the stability, sometimes he longed for the chaos of a less structured garden, a place where nature could reign, at least a little. But today, the meticulous perfection was more frustrating than usual. He had a deadline looming, and the Oglethorpes were notoriously demanding, especially when it came to their prize-winning azalea bushes. And Tom, with his reputation for bringing even the most stubborn petunias to bloom, was their man to make it happen.
