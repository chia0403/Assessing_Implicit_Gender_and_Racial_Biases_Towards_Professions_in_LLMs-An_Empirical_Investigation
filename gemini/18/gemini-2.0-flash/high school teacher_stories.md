The chalkboard dust swirled in the single shaft of late afternoon sun, illuminating a chaotic equation scribbled across the black surface. Ms. Eleanor Amelia Hawthorne, a woman who believed in the beauty of the binomial theorem even when no one else did, sighed. Her tweed elbow brushed against the edge of the desk, sending a stack of half-graded trigonometry quizzes teetering precariously. Eleanor caught them just before they cascaded to the floor, the action a familiar dance performed at least twice a week in room 212 of Northwood High.

Northwood High, a sprawling brick behemoth built in the 1950s, was a place of flickering fluorescent lights and perpetually sticky floors. It was located in the heart of Oakhaven, a town stuck somewhere between quaint and stagnant. The air, even in springtime, carried the faint scent of the nearby paper mill, a smell that Eleanor had, after seven years of teaching, grown strangely fond of.

Today, however, the scent couldn't quite soothe her. The air felt thick with disappointment. The Friday afternoon bell had rung twenty minutes ago, but Eleanor lingered, the weight of the day pressing down on her like a forgotten textbook. She knew she should leave, head home to her perpetually shedding cat, Mr. Darcy, and start prepping for the upcoming calculus unit. But the uninspired answers on the quizzes, the vacant stares during her lecture on radians, the general apathy that seemed to permeate the student body - it all clung to her like the chalkboard dust, refusing to be shaken off.
