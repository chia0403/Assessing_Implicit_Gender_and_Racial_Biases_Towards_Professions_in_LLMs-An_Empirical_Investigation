The rain hammered against the bay window of Dr. Eleanor Amelia Vance's study, mimicking the relentless throbbing behind her temples. Dusk had fallen hours ago, painting the Puget Sound outside in shades of bruised purple and inky black. Inside, the soft glow of the Tiffany lamp cast long, amber shadows across the cluttered shelves, overflowing with psychology textbooks, well-worn novels, and faded photographs of her family. The air, thick with the scent of lavender oil Eleanor used to diffuse before sessions, now felt stale, heavy with the unspoken anxieties of the day.

Eleanor leaned back in her antique leather armchair, its worn surface molded to the shape of her own body after years of use. Outside, the howl of a distant ferry horn pierced the storm's fury, a mournful sound that echoed the disquiet simmering within her. She should be writing her upcoming presentation for the Washington State Psychological Association - a dry but necessary exploration of the efficacy of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in treating late-onset anxiety in elderly patients - but her mind refused to cooperate. Instead, it kept replaying the haunted look in Mrs. Albright's eyes, the tremor in young Thomas's voice, the unsettlingly vacant smile of Mr. Henderson.

Eleanor ran a hand through her short, salt-and-pepper hair, a gesture of weariness that had become all too familiar. Her private practice, "Anchor Point Counseling," perched on a bluff overlooking the Sound in the small town of Port Townsend, Washington, was usually a haven, a place where she could help her patients navigate the turbulent waters of their minds. Lately, though, the tide seemed to be turning, bringing with it a strange and unsettling current that she couldn't quite decipher. And that, more than the persistent rain or the looming deadline, kept her awake at night.
