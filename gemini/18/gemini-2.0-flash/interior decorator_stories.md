The late afternoon sun, a bruised peach color, slanted through the massive, gothic windows of Oakhaven Manor, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air like tiny, restless spirits. Amelia Bellweather-Smythe, her nose wrinkled in distaste, adjusted the silk scarf draped around her neck, a futile attempt to ward off the chill that seemed permanently embedded in the stone walls. Oakhaven was imposing, certainly, but also damp and depressing, like living inside a particularly gloomy mausoleum.

Amelia, a name that felt entirely too delicate for the task before her, had built a reputation for breathing life back into forgotten spaces. With her sharp eye, her boundless imagination, and a healthy dose of stubbornness, she could transform even the most derelict hovel into a haven of sophisticated comfort. But Oakhaven… Oakhaven felt different. It felt resistant.

This sprawling ancestral home of the Earl of Ashworth had been unoccupied for nearly a century, left to decay slowly after a string of tragic, rather melodramatic, deaths. The Earl, a recluse named Alistair Finch, had finally decided, quite impulsively according to the gossip buzzing around the local village, to reclaim his heritage. He'd hired Amelia, sight unseen, after a brief, cryptic phone call, giving her carte blanche to “make the place habitable” with only one chilling caveat: "Do not disturb the west wing. Ever."

The task had seemed daunting enough when Amelia accepted the commission in her cozy, sun-drenched London office. Now, standing in the cavernous, echoing entrance hall, staring up at a portrait of a stern-faced woman with eyes that seemed to follow her, Amelia Bellweather-Smythe felt a prickle of unease that had nothing to do with the drafts or the looming deadlines. This wasn't just a restoration project; it felt like an excavation of the past, and she had a sinking suspicion that some things were better left buried.
