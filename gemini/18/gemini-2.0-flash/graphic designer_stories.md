The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan and clawed at Elara Vivian Hayes' cheeks, turning them the color of overripe cranberries. She huddled deeper into her worn, but beloved, pea coat, the collar scratching at her neck.

Needed to figure out how to make "Algorithmic Affinity" sound less like a sterile scientific experiment and more like a romantic romp through a field of digital daisies.
