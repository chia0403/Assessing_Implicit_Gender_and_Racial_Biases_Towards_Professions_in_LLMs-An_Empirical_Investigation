## Story Opening:

The rhythmic thump of the bass vibrated through Amelia Rose Kendrick’s chest as she surveyed the class. Twenty pairs of expectant eyes, clad in leggings and bright workout gear, stared back at her from the mirrored wall of "Synergy Sculpt," a trendy boutique fitness studio in the heart of downtown Austin. Amelia adjusted the headset microphone, her own skin damp with a pre-emptive sheen, and flashed a smile that was practiced but genuine.

“Alright, Synergy Squad! Welcome back! Let’s kick Monday in the *butt*!” she yelled, her voice amplified and crackling slightly. A smattering of whoops and claps echoed back, feeding her energy. She raised her arms, palms up, and the music swelled – a relentless, pulsing beat that promised both pain and exhilaration.

But as the first notes of Lizzo's "Good as Hell" blasted through the speakers, a flicker of doubt clouded Amelia's expertly curated enthusiasm. Lately, the curated facade was getting harder to maintain. The perky, relentlessly positive Amelia Rose Kendrick of Synergy Sculpt felt miles away from the real Amelia Rose Kendrick, who preferred quiet evenings with a good book and the company of her grumpy tabby cat, Mr. Darcy. Tonight, she felt less “good as hell” and more “good as…asleep.” 

She forced the feeling down, just another phantom muscle ache to be ignored. It was showtime.
