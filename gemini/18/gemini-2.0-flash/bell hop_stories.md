Okay, here's a story opening with the setting and the full name of the main character as a bellhop:

**Story Opening and Setting:**

The revolving doors of the Grand Imperial Hotel sighed open, expelling a gust of late-September wind that threatened to snatch the tasseled fez right off Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins' head. Bart, ever vigilant, adjusted it with a practiced flick of his wrist. He'd been stationed at these very doors, rain or shine, tourist season or the dead of winter, for eleven years, give or take a snow day or two.

The Grand Imperial, a behemoth of gilded age architecture, dominated the Chicago skyline with its ornate facade and promise of opulence. Inside, crystal chandeliers cast a warm glow across the marble lobby floor, reflecting off the brass trim and the polished mahogany of the reception desk. The air hummed with the quiet murmur of conversations, the tinkling of a piano from the adjacent cocktail lounge, and the hushed rustle of expensive luggage being wheeled across the plush carpets.

Bart inhaled deeply, a familiar comfort in the scent of beeswax polish, expensive perfume, and the faint, lingering aroma of freshly baked croissants from the hotel's renowned patisserie. He straightened his crisp, navy blue uniform, his brass buttons gleaming under the chandelier light. It was another Tuesday, another day to play gatekeeper to the comings and goings of the city's elite, the weary travelers, and the occasional, bewildered tourist who'd wandered in off the street. Little did Bart know, this particular Tuesday would prove to be anything but ordinary.
