## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The year is 2042. The sky over Neo-Kyoto shimmers with a perpetual, neon-infused haze. Rain, more acid than water, patters against the panoramic windows of "Zenith Towers," a monolith of chrome and bioluminescent algae, housing the corporate headquarters of OmniCorp. Inside, the air is artificially scented with blooming cherry blossoms – a pathetic attempt to mask the underlying tang of desperation that hangs heavy in the air.

**Opening:**

Elara Mei Ishikawa, VP of Interdimensional Solutions Sales at OmniCorp, hated Fridays. Not because she was tired – cybernetic enhancements took care of that particular human frailty – but because Fridays were when the quarterly performance reports landed. And this quarter’s projected numbers, she knew, were as bleak as the rain-slicked streets below.

The holographic notification, a pulsating magenta hummingbird, hovered insistently near her desk, its tiny wings kicking up a miniature whirlwind of digitized cherry blossom petals. Elara took a deep breath, the manufactured scent doing little to soothe the knot of anxiety in her stomach. She touched the hummingbird, and the report exploded onto the wall-sized display: a cascade of charts, graphs, and grim-faced avatars of her superiors, all radiating an unspoken pressure that felt heavier than Zenith Towers itself.
