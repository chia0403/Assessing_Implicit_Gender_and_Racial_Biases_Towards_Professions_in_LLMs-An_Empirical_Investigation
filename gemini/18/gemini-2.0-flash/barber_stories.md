## Story Opening:

The bell above the door of "A Cut Above" jangled a tired, familiar tune, momentarily disrupting the hum of the vintage barber shop's refrigerator and the gentle, rhythmic snip-snip-snip of scissors. Elias Theodore Dubois, owner, operator, and sole barber of the establishment, barely glanced up from the salt-and-pepper swirl atop Mr. Henderson's head. He knew the sound. It was either Mrs. Gable wanting to drop off another batch of her suspiciously potent rhubarb jam, or, much more likely, another tourist lured in by the faded "Authentic Old-Time Barber" sign hanging askew above the entrance. He preferred the tourists, at least they tipped better than Mrs. Gable.

He finished sculpting the last rogue hair on Mr. Henderson’s crown, flicked it away with a practiced flourish, and finally looked up, a polite, practiced smile already forming on his lips. "Alright, Mr. Henderson, take a look-see. What do you think?"

## Setting:

"A Cut Above" was a relic, a snapshot pulled straight from a black and white photograph and meticulously placed on the sleepy main street of Havenwood, Maine. The building itself was a squat, brick structure, its original facade stained by years of salty sea air and stubborn lichen. Inside, the air hung thick with the comforting scents of bay rum, shaving cream, and the faint, metallic tang of sharpening steel.

Two antique barber chairs, upholstered in cracked and worn burgundy leather, faced a long, mirrored wall lined with dusty bottles of hair tonic and pomade. A faded barber's pole, its red, white, and blue stripes perpetually peeling, stood sentinel just inside the window, its once vibrant colours bleached by the relentless Maine sun. Yellowed newspaper clippings, showcasing Havenwood's bygone glory days – primarily fishing competitions and pie-eating contests – adorned the walls, interspersed with framed certificates of completion from various barbering courses Elias had taken decades ago. A mismatched collection of vintage combs, brushes, and straight razors filled a glass case in the corner, testament to a life spent honing his craft. In the back, a small, cluttered room served as Elias's office and break room, containing a dented metal desk piled high with invoices, a lukewarm coffee pot that hissed and sputtered more than it brewed, and a well-worn armchair where he often napped between customers, dreaming of smoother shaves and less talkative tourists.
