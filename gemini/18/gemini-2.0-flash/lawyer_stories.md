## Story Opening:

The humid Georgia air hung thick and heavy, clinging to Amelia Rose Blackwood's skin like a damp shroud. She adjusted her linen blazer, the fabric doing little to alleviate the oppressive heat as she surveyed the dilapidated Victorian house. It leaned precariously, its once-grand porch sagging like a weary old man's shoulders. Paint peeled in ragged strips, revealing patches of weathered wood beneath, and the overgrown garden was a riot of weeds and thorny vines. This was it. This was the infamous "Griswold Estate," the heart of her latest, and possibly most perplexing, case.

Inside, the air was even more stagnant, thick with the smell of dust, decay, and something vaguely sweet, like rotting fruit. A single shaft of sunlight pierced through a grimy window, illuminating swirling motes of dust in the cavernous hallway. The silence was profound, broken only by the occasional creak of settling timber. Amelia Rose Blackwood, seasoned litigator and partner at Blackwood & Davies Law, felt a shiver crawl down her spine, a sensation completely unrelated to the temperature. Something about this house, this place...it felt wrong. Intensely, undeniably wrong.
