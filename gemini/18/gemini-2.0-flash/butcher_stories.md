Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a butcher named as the main character:

**Setting:** The small, seaside town of Port Blossom, Maine. November. A biting wind whips off the slate-grey Atlantic, carrying the scent of salt and decaying seaweed. The town's main street, usually bustling with tourists in the summer, is now mostly deserted, the colorful storefronts shuttered for the winter.

**Story Opening:**

The bell above the door of "O'Malley's Fine Meats" jingled a mournful, lonely sound in the near-empty shop. Seamus Finnegan, his thick hands red and raw from the cold, barely registered it. He was too busy wrestling with a stubborn side of beef, its marbled fat glistening under the harsh fluorescent lights. He hummed a tuneless melody, one his grandfather had taught him â€“ a mournful Irish ballad about shipwrecks and lost love. The music usually helped, but today even the familiar rhythm couldn't chase away the unease that had been settling over him for days.

Seamus paused, wiping his forehead with the back of his forearm, leaving a streak of blood on his already smudged apron. The wind howled outside, rattling the windows like a desperate beggar pleading for entry. It was a week before Thanksgiving, and while other folks were planning elaborate feasts, Port Blossom felt like it was slowly being swallowed by the encroaching darkness of winter. The summer folk were long gone, the tourists vanished like a spent wave on the shore. Seamus just wanted the next few weeks to hurry on by.

He took a deep breath, the smell of sawdust and raw meat heavy in his lungs. He picked up his cleaver, its familiar weight a small comfort, and brought it down with a practiced, decisive *thwack*. It was time to get back to work. He had orders to fill, mouths to feed, and a growing feeling of foreboding he couldn't quite shake. A feeling that something, like the relentless November wind, was about to blow into Port Blossom, something unwelcome and unforgiving.
