## Story Opening & Setting:

**Opening:**

The smell of bleach was always the worst part. It clung to the back of your throat, a sterile and suffocating reminder of the violence that had unfolded. Dr. Eleanor Vance pushed open the squeaky door of the evidence room, the metallic tang instantly assaulting her nostrils. She tugged her scarf higher, a futile attempt to ward off the phantom chill of the crime scene. This was case file number 23-41, the "Carousel Killer," and it was already burrowing under her skin like a malignant splinter.

She needed to understand him. Not condone, not forgive, but understand. Because somewhere, hidden beneath the brutality, lay a twisted logic, a shattered psyche, and Eleanor Vance was tasked with piecing it all back together. Before he struck again.

**Setting:**

The story is set in the gritty, rain-soaked city of **Seattle, Washington, in the early months of 2024**. The Pacific Northwest gloom hangs heavy, mirroring the somber mood permeating the city in the wake of the Carousel Killer's escalating spree.

Eleanor's workspace is a stark, utilitarian office within the King County Prosecuting Attorney's Office. The walls are painted a dull, government-issue beige, decorated only with framed degrees and certificates that speak to her expertise. Sunlight, a rare commodity in Seattle, struggles to penetrate the blinds, casting long, gray shadows across her cluttered desk. The desk itself is a testament to her demanding workload, piled high with case files, transcripts, psychological assessments, and half-empty mugs of lukewarm coffee. The constant hum of the city filters through the window, a discordant symphony of sirens, traffic, and the distant cries of gulls, a constant reminder of the lives she's fighting to protect.
