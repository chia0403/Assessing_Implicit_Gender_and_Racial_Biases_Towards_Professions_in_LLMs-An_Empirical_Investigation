The biting wind whipped across the flat, brown fields, stinging Elias Theodore Goodweather’s cheeks until they felt like frozen apples. He pulled his worn, woolen scarf tighter, the scent of sheep and lanolin doing little to warm him against the late November gale. The sun, a pale disc obscured by swirling clouds, offered no comfort either, casting long, skeletal shadows of the bare oak trees that bordered his property.

Elias stood at the edge of what he still, despite years of barren harvests, called his prize field. It stretched out before him, a vast expanse of unforgiving earth, silent save for the mournful howl of the wind. Dust devils danced in the distance, mocking his dreams of overflowing silos and bountiful markets. This was Goodweather Acres, once the pride of Meadow Creek County, now a testament to Elias’s stubborn refusal to give up on land that seemed determined to give up on him. The small, weathered farmhouse, its paint peeling like sunburnt skin, sat further back, a lonely sentinel against the desolate landscape. Inside, a dying fire crackled in the hearth, a lukewarm promise of warmth that Elias knew wouldn't last. He needed to get this land working again, not just for himself, but for the memory of his father, and the legacy of the Goodweathers, a legacy that felt like it was crumbling to dust along with the soil beneath his feet.
