Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a story with a tour guide as the main character:

**Story Opening:**

"Right this way, folks, if you'd be so kind!"  A voice, seasoned with equal parts charm and exhaustion, cut through the humid New Orleans air.  Esmeralda "Ezzy" Broussard gestured theatrically with her brightly-patterned umbrella towards the wrought-iron gates of Lafayette Cemetery No. 1.  She adjusted the microphone clipped to her lapel, battling a rogue curl that insisted on escaping her carefully constructed bun.  "Prepare yourselves for a journey into the city of the dead, where stories whisper from the tombs and the past never truly stays buried." She flashed a practiced, but genuine, smile at the small crowd that had gathered, a motley collection of sunburned tourists, curious locals, and at least one teenager who looked like heâ€™d rather be anywhere else.  Ezzy knew the drill. She'd wrangle them all, one haunted history lesson at a time.

**Setting:**

The story is primarily set in the heart of the historic French Quarter and the Garden District of **New Orleans, Louisiana.** Specific locations include:

*   **Lafayette Cemetery No. 1:** A historic, above-ground cemetery with elaborate family tombs and a palpable atmosphere of age and mystery. The narrow pathways are overgrown, and sunlight filters through the ancient oaks, creating dramatic shadows.

*   **The French Quarter:** The oldest neighborhood in the city, characterized by its vibrant architecture, wrought-iron balconies, bustling streets filled with music and street performers, and historic landmarks like Jackson Square and St. Louis Cathedral.

*   **The Garden District:** An affluent neighborhood known for its grand, antebellum mansions surrounded by lush gardens and towering oak trees dripping with Spanish moss.

*   **Various Bars and Restaurants:**  Ezzy's local haunts, ranging from dive bars frequented by locals to upscale restaurants catering to tourists.  These serve as places for her to unwind, gather information, and sometimes even stumble upon clues related to the mysteries she unravels.
