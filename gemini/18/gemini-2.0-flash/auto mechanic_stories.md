The stale scent of oil, mingled with the sharper tang of brake cleaner, clung to Michael “Mikey” Anthony Rossi like a second skin. It permeated his faded denim shirt, stained his calloused hands, and even seemed to reside in the perpetually scuffed steel-toe boots he favored. Mikey didn’t mind. He found a certain comfort in the familiar aroma, a reassurance that he was where he belonged: beneath the greasy belly of a disgruntled machine in Rossi’s Auto Repair, the family garage he'd inherited from his grandfather.

The garage itself was a relic, a corrugated metal box nestled on the outskirts of the sleepy town of Harmony Creek, Ohio. Sunlight streamed in through the grimy windows, illuminating swirling dust motes that danced in the air. Tools hung haphazardly from pegboards, each with its own designated spot… mostly. An old pin-up calendar, featuring a woman draped across the hood of a '57 Chevy, hung crookedly above the dented toolbox Mikey’s grandfather had passed down. The air buzzed with the low hum of the overhead lights and the rhythmic clatter of a nearby train, a constant reminder of the world outside that Mikey rarely ventured into. Today, however, the only sound he could focus on was the persistent drip, drip, drip coming from beneath a beat-up Ford pickup, a sound that promised a headache and a potentially irate customer.
