## Story Opening:

The sticky New Orleans air clung to the sequins of Magnolia "Maggie" Duboisâ€™ dress like a lovesick admirer.  It wasn't the heat making her breath catch, though.  It was the roar. Not the roar of the crowd yet, but the low, primal hum that thrummed beneath the floorboards of "The Gilded Lily," a jazz club nestled deep in the French Quarter.  A hum that always preceded something special, something sacred.

Maggie smoothed down the unruly tendrils of her dark hair, the humid air already defeating her attempts at taming them.  She could see her reflection in the polished brass of the microphone stand, a nervous ghost staring back. Tonight was different.  Tonight wasn't just another Tuesday gig.  Tonight,  "The Gilded Lily" was packed, not with the usual mix of tourists and die-hard jazz aficionados, but with record executives.  Big ones. The kind who could make or break a career with a single sip of bourbon and a fleeting glance. 

She took a deep breath, the scent of stale beer, perfume, and anticipation thick in the air.  She closed her eyes for a beat, picturing her grandmother, her hands calloused from years of playing the piano in a smoky bar just like this.  "Give them your soul, Magnolia," her grandmother used to say. "Give them every last drop."  

And that's exactly what she intended to do.

## Setting:

**Location:** New Orleans, Louisiana, specifically the French Quarter.

**Venue:** "The Gilded Lily," a classic jazz club. Think:

*   **Visually:** Dimly lit, with red velvet booths and flickering candlelight on small, round tables. Exposed brick walls adorned with vintage posters of legendary jazz musicians.  A small, raised stage dominated by a gleaming microphone stand. Heavy drapes help to keep the sound contained.
*   **Atmospherically:** The air is thick with the scent of stale beer, rich perfume, and the faint but pervasive aroma of humidity. The hum of conversation mingles with the clinking of glasses and the subtle, nervous tapping of feet.  A low-level tension hangs in the air, palpable amongst the patrons.
*   **Audibly:** Before the music starts, there's a constant buzz of chatter, punctuated by the occasional burst of laughter. The clatter of dishes and the murmuring of the bartenders add to the soundscape.

**Time:** Evening, Tuesday night.
