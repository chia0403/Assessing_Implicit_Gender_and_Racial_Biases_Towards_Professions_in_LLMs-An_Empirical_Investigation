Okay, here's a story opening and setting centered around a drafting worker:

**Story Opening:**

The scent of graphite dust and stale coffee was as familiar to Archibald "Archie" Penhaligon as the feel of his favorite mechanical pencil in his hand. He leaned back in his squeaky office chair, the fluorescent lights of "Henderson & Bell, Architectural Drafters" reflecting harshly off the sheen of his balding head. Outside, the late afternoon rain hammered against the grimy window, blurring the already drab cityscape of lower Manhattan. Another day, another blueprint, another soul-crushing feeling of anonymity. He'd spent the last fifteen years perfecting his lines, meticulously detailing cornices and calculating stress points for buildings he’d never even set foot in. Today, however, was different. He’d found an anomaly in the plans for the new Henderson Tower, something small, almost imperceptible, yet it nagged at him with the persistence of a splinter. A misplaced support beam? An off-kilter wall? He couldn't quite put his finger on it, but the more he stared at the intricate web of lines and measurements, the more uneasy he felt. And Archie Penhaligon, meticulous, meticulous, Archie Penhaligon, never ignored a feeling, especially one etched in ink.

**Setting:**

The story is set in the late 1980s in a small, slightly rundown drafting office located in the financial district of lower Manhattan, New York City. The office, "Henderson & Bell, Architectural Drafters," is a no-frills space filled with rows of large drafting tables, each cluttered with blueprints, architectural tools (rulers, compasses, t-squares), and personal belongings. The walls are painted a pale, institutional green, and the only decorations are a few outdated architectural posters and a faded photo of the firm's founders. The atmosphere is generally quiet and focused, punctuated by the rhythmic scratching of pencils, the whirring of blueprint machines, and the occasional muttered curse. The neighborhood outside is a mix of towering skyscrapers and older, pre-war buildings, a constant reminder of the city's rapid development and the potential for both progress and destruction.
