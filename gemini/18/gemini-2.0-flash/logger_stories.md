## Story Opening:

The wind howled a mournful dirge through the skeletal branches of the hemlocks, a sound that echoed the ache in Joseph "Joe" Callahan's bones. He spat a stream of tobacco juice onto the snow-dusted ground, the brown stain quickly absorbed into the white. Another day. Another tree. Another dollar closer to digging himself out of the hole his daddy left behind.

The chainsaw roared to life, a defiant snarl against the wind's lament. Joe felt the vibrations through his thick gloves, a familiar hum that soothed him in a way few things could. He adjusted his ear muffs, his weathered face, permanently tanned by the sun and wind, creasing around his eyes. It was cold, damn cold, even for late November in these parts. But the cold never stopped the work, and Joe, unlike some, never shied away from the work. It was honest work, back-breaking work, the kind that built a man, or broke him. He just hoped he was building.

## Setting:

The story is set in the remote, mountainous region of **Northwestern Montana**, specifically in the Kootenai National Forest. The year is 1958. The landscape is dominated by towering coniferous trees – predominantly hemlock, pine, and fir – blanketed in a layer of fresh, early-winter snow. The air is crisp and biting, carrying the scent of pine and damp earth. The days are short and the nights are long, the sun barely cresting the peaks before dipping behind them again.

Joe's workspace is a small clearing carved out amongst the trees. Fallen logs, stacked high like monuments, attest to his labor. His battered pickup truck, a rusty Ford F-100, sits parked at the edge of the clearing, its bed loaded with freshly cut timber. A small, ramshackle cabin, barely visible through the trees, serves as Joe's home – a refuge from the harsh elements and a silent testament to the solitary life he leads. The overall atmosphere is one of rugged isolation, beauty tinged with hardship, and a relentless, unforgiving nature.
