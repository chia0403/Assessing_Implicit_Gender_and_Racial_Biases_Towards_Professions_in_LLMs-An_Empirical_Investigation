The sun, a molten penny in the vast, bruised-purple sky, was just beginning to kiss the horizon as Jedediah "Jed" Calhoun rode his buckskin mare, Clementine, along the perimeter fence. The air, crisp and cool after the day’s sweltering heat, carried the scent of sagebrush and damp earth. Dust motes danced in the fading light, painting the vast Montana landscape in fleeting shades of gold. Jed tightened his grip on the worn leather reins, his gaze sweeping across the rolling hills, dotted with grazing cattle that looked like dark smudges against the deepening dusk.

This was Calhoun Ranch, all twenty-thousand acres of it. Land that had been in his family for three generations, land carved out of the unforgiving wilderness with sweat, grit, and a whole lot of stubborn pride. Tonight, though, the pride felt a little…thin. The drought was biting deep, turning the pastureland brittle and leaving the creek beds parched. The cattle were growing lean, and the worry lines etched around Jed's weathered eyes seemed to mirror the cracks appearing in the dry earth.
