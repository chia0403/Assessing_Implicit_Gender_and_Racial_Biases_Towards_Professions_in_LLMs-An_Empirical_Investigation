The aroma of burnt oat milk hung thick in the air, a testament to Dr. Eleanor Vance’s inability to multitask, even at 7:15 AM. Sunlight, filtered through the grimy windows of her tiny, rent-controlled apartment above the “Little Italy” Pizzeria (which was, ironically, neither little nor Italian), painted uneven stripes across the exposed brick wall. Eleanor, a dietician with a doctorate in nutritional science and a frankly appalling track record with breakfast preparation, coughed dramatically, waving a tea towel that was more stained than clean.

Her apartment, a cramped studio in the heart of Brooklyn’s DUMBO neighborhood, was a study in contradictions. Neat stacks of peer-reviewed journals sat precariously on the edge of a wobbly bookshelf, threatening to avalanche onto a yoga mat that never saw the light of day. A state-of-the-art Vitamix blender, practically worshipped in online dietician forums, occupied prime counter space next to a chipped ceramic mug emblazoned with the ironic phrase, "I <3 Processed Food."

The building itself, a pre-war relic fighting a losing battle against gentrification, hummed with the low thrum of the city outside. Sirens wailed in the distance, competing with the insistent thump of bass from the yoga studio downstairs and the faint, greasy scent of pepperoni pizza that permeated everything, including Eleanor's dreams. Today, the greasy scent was particularly unwelcome. Today, Eleanor Vance had to face the reality of a very important, and potentially career-altering, meeting at the prestigious Manhattan Wellness Institute. And she smelled like burnt oat milk and unfulfilled potential.
