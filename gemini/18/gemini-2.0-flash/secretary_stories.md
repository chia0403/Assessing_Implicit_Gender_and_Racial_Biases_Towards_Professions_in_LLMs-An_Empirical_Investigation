The clack of the ancient, oil-stained typewriter was the soundtrack to Beatrice Penelope Ainsworth's life. It echoed through the cramped, perpetually dusty office of "Grimshaw & Sons, Purveyors of Fine Mortuary Goods," a melody that, after seven years, had etched itself deep into her bones. Outside, the November wind howled a mournful counterpoint, rattling the loose panes of the bay window and threatening to tear the tattered awning displaying the company name clean off.

Beatrice sat hunched beneath the sickly yellow glow of a bare bulb, her thin fingers flying across the keys. Today's task: composing a suitably somber advertisement for the upcoming "Winter Remembrance Sale" of discounted caskets and urns. Beatrice sighed. Discount caskets. Honestly. Sometimes, she felt as though she was the only person in this morbid establishment with a shred of decency.
