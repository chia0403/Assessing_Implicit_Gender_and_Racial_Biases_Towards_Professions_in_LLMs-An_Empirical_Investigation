**Setting:**

The humid air hung thick and heavy in the Quonset hut, clinging to everything like a damp shroud. It was 1968, deep in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam, and the relentless sun beat down on the corrugated metal roof, turning the inside into a sweltering oven.

He picked up a soldering iron, the tip glowing a menacing orange, and muttered, "Alright, you stubborn piece of junk, let's see if I can bring you back from the dead one more time."
