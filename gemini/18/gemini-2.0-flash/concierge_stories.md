Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a concierge named Cordelia Beatrice Plum:

**Setting:**

The Hôtel Luminescence, Paris, France. A Belle Époque masterpiece nestled on a quiet, cobbled street just off the Champs-Élysées. The hotel, while boasting five-star amenities and a Michelin-starred restaurant, prioritizes discreet luxury and personalized service above ostentatious displays of wealth. The lobby is hushed, bathed in the soft glow of crystal chandeliers and the scent of freshly cut lilies. Antique furniture sits on Persian carpets, and the walls are adorned with impressionistic paintings. Behind the mahogany concierge desk, a bank of pigeonholes overflows with envelopes and messages, a testament to the hotel's popularity and the complex lives that pass through its doors.

**Opening:**

Cordelia Beatrice Plum smoothed an invisible wrinkle from the pristine white blouse beneath her navy blue concierge jacket. The faint hum of the Hôtel Luminescence's atmosphere – a blend of hushed conversations, the clinking of silverware from the nearby Brasserie des Étoiles, and the distant chime of a taxi bell – was as familiar and comforting to her as her own heartbeat. It was 6:03 PM, the tail end of the afternoon rush, when she’d helped navigate a bewildered Japanese honeymoon couple to the Eiffel Tower and secured a last-minute reservation at a notoriously exclusive jazz club for a visiting American senator. Now, a brief lull descended, allowing Cordelia a moment to survey the polished marble floor, the arrangement of white orchids on the registration desk, and, most importantly, the steady stream of faces entering and exiting the grand revolving doors. Each face held a story, a secret, a need. And Cordelia, with her sharp eyes, her encyclopedic knowledge of Paris, and her uncanny intuition, considered it her personal mission to unravel those stories, fulfill those needs, and ensure that every guest left the Luminescence feeling as though they'd stepped into a perfectly crafted dream. But tonight, the face approaching her desk was different. It wasn't a guest she recognized, nor a new arrival. It was a man, tall and wiry, with a face etched with a desperate urgency that made the lilies in their vase seem to wilt under his gaze. He clutched a crumpled photograph in his hand, and Cordelia had a sinking feeling her quiet evening was about to be irrevocably, perhaps dangerously, disrupted.
