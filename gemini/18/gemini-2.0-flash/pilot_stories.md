## Story Opening & Setting:

**Opening:**

The metallic tang of fear clung to Amelia “Echo” Harrington’s tongue, a familiar, unwelcome taste. It wasn’t the kind that came with the dizzying spin of a botched barrel roll, or the sudden lurch of turbulence over the Rockies. This was the fear that crept under your skin and told you, with chilling certainty, that you were utterly, completely alone. The emergency beacon, stubbornly silent, hadn’t chirped once in the last six hours. Outside, the arctic wind howled a mournful symphony around the mangled wreckage of her single-engine De Havilland Beaver, a stark reminder of the gamble she'd taken, and the price she might pay.

**Setting:**

The story unfolds in the desolate, snow-covered landscape of the Brooks Range, Alaska, during the dead of winter. The year is 2047. Harsh, icy winds sculpt drifts that swallow the landscape whole. The air is so cold it bites at exposed skin and freezes breath into shimmering plumes. The sun, a weak and distant memory, barely crests the horizon for a few agonizing hours each day, plunging the world back into a long, unforgiving night dominated by the ethereal dance of the aurora borealis. The only signs of human presence are the scattered, long-abandoned mining outposts, relics of a past resource boom, and the occasional, fleeting tracks of wildlife struggling to survive in this unforgiving environment. Amelia's crash site is nestled in a small, windswept valley, offering minimal protection from the elements but, crucially, a source of fresh water from a partially frozen stream.
