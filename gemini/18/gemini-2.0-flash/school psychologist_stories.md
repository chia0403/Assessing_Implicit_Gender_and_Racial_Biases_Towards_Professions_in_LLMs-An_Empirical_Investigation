## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The oppressive humidity hung thick in the air of Willow Creek Middle School, clinging to the worn linoleum floors and clinging to the faces of the weary students shuffling through the hallways. Summer was determined to make one last, desperate stand before the cool kiss of autumn finally prevailed. Inside Dr. Eleanor Marguerite Ainsworth's dimly lit office, the air conditioning unit rattled with the tenacity of a dying beast, barely managing to keep the sticky heat at bay. Stacks of manila folders, each labeled with a student's name, towered precariously on her desk, threatening to topple over at the slightest provocation. The scent of stale coffee and lavender hand lotion, a pathetic attempt at aromatherapy, permeated the small space.

**Opening:** Eleanor Marguerite Ainsworth ran a weary hand through her perpetually messy bun, dislodging a rogue bobby pin that pinged against her desk. The buzzing fluorescent light overhead seemed to amplify the pounding in her temples. Today was Friday, usually a blessed release, but the events of the past week had left her feeling as wrung out as a damp dishrag. First, the escalating bullying incident involving seventh-grader, Mark Riley, then the heartbreaking meeting with Mrs. Davis, whose son, Ethan, was exhibiting signs of severe anxiety. And now, as if orchestrated by some malevolent force, the intercom crackled to life, shattering the momentary silence. "Dr. Ainsworth, please report to Principal Thompson's office immediately. It's aboutâ€¦ well, you better come now." The urgency in Mrs. Gable's voice, usually as smooth as buttercream frosting, sent a chill down Eleanor's spine. Something was terribly wrong.
