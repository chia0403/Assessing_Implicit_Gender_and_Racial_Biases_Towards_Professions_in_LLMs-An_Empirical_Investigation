Okay, here's a story opening, setting, and character introduction:

**Setting:**

The year is 1888. The setting is the rugged, windswept Isle of Skye in the Scottish Highlands. Small, hardy villages cling to the rocky coastline, their gray stone houses mirroring the harsh beauty of the landscape. The air is thick with the scent of salt and peat smoke. The days are often shrouded in mist, and the sea is a constant presence, both a source of life and a dangerous force. The local economy revolves around fishing, crofting, and the quarrying of the island's distinctive basalt stone.

**Opening:**

The rhythmic clang of steel against stone echoed across the moor, a lonely counterpoint to the cries of the gulls overhead. Finlay MacLeod, his brow furrowed with concentration, swung his hammer with practiced ease. A shower of granite chips erupted from the block before him, catching the weak morning light. He wiped a bead of sweat from his forehead with the back of a calloused hand, leaving a streak of gray dust across his weathered skin. It was back-breaking work, this life he led, but it was honest, and it was his.

Finlay MacLeod paused, his gaze drifting from the stone to the horizon. The sea, a churning expanse of slate gray, was hidden under the heavy fog. Another day, another struggle against the elements, another stone to carve.

**Full Character Name:**

The main character's full name is Finlay MacLeod.
