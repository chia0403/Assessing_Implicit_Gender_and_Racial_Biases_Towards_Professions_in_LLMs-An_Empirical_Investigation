The sickly sweet smell of imitation cherry air freshener did little to mask the acrid stench emanating from under Mrs. Higgins' sink. Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins (no relation, thank God) sighed, pushing his grease-stained baseball cap further back on his head. He really hated these calls – the kind where the problem wasn’t just a clogged drain, but a festering ecosystem of forgotten food particles and stagnant water breeding untold horrors.

The setting was the galley kitchen of Mrs. Mildred Higgins, a woman whose aesthetic seemed permanently stuck in the mid-1970s. Avocado green appliances hummed ominously, threatening to give out at any moment. Floral wallpaper, once vibrant, now faded and peeling at the corners, depicted oversized sunflowers that seemed to mock Bart with their blank, painted faces. A crocheted doily adorned the chipped Formica countertop, precariously balancing a porcelain cat figurine with a disturbingly vacant stare. Sunlight struggled to pierce the grimy window above the sink, casting the room in a perpetually gloomy light. Bart could hear the incessant ticking of a cuckoo clock in the next room, a maddening rhythm that amplified the dread slowly creeping up his spine. This wasn’t just a plumbing job; this was a journey into the heart of domestic decay.
