The fluorescent lights hummed a relentless, high-pitched song that echoed off the gleaming, sterile surfaces of the examination room. A faint scent of mint and despair hung in the air, a signature fragrance exclusive to dental offices worldwide. Penelope Adelaide Hawthorne, armed with a scaler and a forced smile, braced herself. Mrs. Higgins, her next patient, was known for her tenacious tartar buildup and even more tenacious opinions on fluoride.

Penelope smoothed down her crisp, pale blue scrubs and took a deep breath, the air tasting faintly of rubber gloves and lemon-scented disinfectant. She worked in "Smiles of the South," a surprisingly busy dental practice nestled in the heart of Charleston, South Carolina. The practice itself was located in a meticulously restored Victorian house, a relic of a bygone era incongruously housing the whirring drills and high-tech X-ray machines of modern dentistry. The charming exterior, with its wide, welcoming porch and hanging baskets overflowing with vibrant geraniums, often lulled patients into a false sense of calm, which Penelope knew would shatter the moment they settled into the reclining chair.
