Okay, here's a story opening with a surgeon as the main character, including the setting:

**Story Opening:**

The sterile, pale light of operating room six hummed, a counterpoint to the rhythmic beep of the heart monitor. Dr. Alistair James Blackwood didn't even register either. He was lost in the intricate landscape of the human heart, his brow furrowed in concentration as he navigated the delicate vessels with the practiced ease of a seasoned mountaineer charting a treacherous peak. Sweat beaded on his forehead, reflecting in the magnification lenses of his surgical loupes. Outside, a storm raged, rattling the windows of St. Jude’s Hospital, but inside, all was focused, controlled, and terrifyingly quiet.

A nurse, masked and gowned, dabbed his brow with a sterile cloth. "Dr. Blackwood," she murmured, her voice barely audible above the ambient noise, "the attending just called. They're diverting ambulances. Highway's shut down. Multiple vehicle pile-up."

Alistair’s gloved hand stilled for a fraction of a second. He took a steadying breath. "Inform them to give the estimated ETAs of the incoming patients to the triage team. Prioritize by severity. I can't leave Mrs. Hawthorne's chest open to deal with fender benders." He resumed his work, the tiny stitch in his hand a lifeline in a world gone momentarily mad. He had a failing mitral valve to replace, and a life hanging in the balance. The storm outside could wait. Mrs. Hawthorne couldn't.
