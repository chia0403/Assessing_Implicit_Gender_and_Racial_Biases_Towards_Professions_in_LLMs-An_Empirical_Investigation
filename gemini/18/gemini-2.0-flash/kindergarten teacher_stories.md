The salt-laced wind whipped Amelia Rose Hawthorne’s hair across her face as she wrestled the giant, inflatable rainbow over the threshold of the Bright Beginnings Kindergarten’s back entrance. The October air, crisp and hinting at the coming winter, felt less like a playful caress and more like a mischievous gust trying to steal her silly, plastic arc of happiness.

Bright Beginnings wasn't much to look at from the outside: a squat, single-story building painted a faded sunshine yellow, perched precariously on the edge of Harmony Bay, a small, perpetually windswept fishing town on the coast of Maine. The playground, a modest patch of woodchips and slightly rusty swings, offered breathtaking views of the grey, churning Atlantic. Amelia, however, saw past the weathered exterior and the unforgiving weather. She saw the potential, the endless possibilities for wonder and learning contained within those yellow walls.

Inside, the kindergarten classroom – "The Sunshine Room," as Amelia had christened it – buzzed with controlled chaos. Tiny, glitter-covered hands were industriously gluing googly eyes onto paper pumpkins. The air smelled gloriously of Elmer’s glue, tempera paint, and the faint, comforting scent of baking apple cider donuts, a pre-Halloween tradition she’d started three years ago. Mrs. Crabtree, the school's perpetually flustered but eternally kind principal, bustled around the edges of the room, attempting (and failing) to discreetly sample the donuts from the cooling rack. The children, all twenty-two of them, were oblivious, lost in their own miniature, sparkly worlds. Amelia grinned, pushing the unwieldy rainbow towards the far wall. It was going to be a good day, she thought, despite the rogue wind outside.
