The rain, a relentless, mournful drizzle, mirrored the state of Arthur Penhaligon's manuscript. He stared at the computer screen, the cursor blinking mockingly, daring him to write something, anything, that wasn't utter drivel. The cramped attic room, his self-proclaimed writer's sanctuary, only amplified his sense of failure. Dust motes danced in the weak afternoon light filtering through the single, grime-coated window, a light that did little to illuminate the overflowing bookshelves and stacks of papers threatening to topple onto his head. He was surrounded by the ghosts of stories past, both his own abandoned projects and the literary giants whose shadows he desperately tried, and consistently failed, to escape. This ramshackle Victorian house, inherited from his eccentric Aunt Agatha, stood sentinel on the blustery Cornish coast, its peeling paint and creaking timbers a constant reminder of the weight of history, and Arthur's crippling writer's block.
