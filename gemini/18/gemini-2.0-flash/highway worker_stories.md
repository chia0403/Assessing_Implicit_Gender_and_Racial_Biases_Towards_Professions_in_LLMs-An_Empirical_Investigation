## Opening:

The air hung thick and heavy, a humid blanket woven with the scent of hot asphalt and diesel fumes. Johnathan Michael O’Connell squinted, wiping a bead of sweat from his brow with the back of his calloused hand. He adjusted the brim of his hard hat, the fluorescent orange a beacon against the oppressive grey sky that threatened a summer storm. Another pothole. Another crack spiderwebbing across the blacktop like a malevolent joke. He sighed, the sound lost to the roar of a semi-truck barreling past, its horn a brief, impatient blast that vibrated in his chest. Forty-two years old, Johnathan O’Connell, and this was his life: patching up the endless wounds inflicted upon Highway 6 by the relentless march of progress and the uncaring whims of the weather.

## Setting:

The setting is a desolate stretch of Highway 6, cutting through the heart of rural Ohio. Rolling hills, dotted with cornfields and the occasional dilapidated barn, flank the road. The air smells of farmland and exhaust, a contradictory mix that speaks of a struggling economy clinging to the remnants of its agricultural past. Johnathan and his crew are working a particularly bad section, about twenty miles south of the small town of Harmony Creek. Their work zone is clearly marked with cones and flashing lights, but drivers, often rushing to somewhere deemed more important, still treat it with a reckless disregard that keeps Johnathan perpetually on edge. The sun beats down mercilessly, turning the asphalt into a simmering griddle. The only respite is the infrequent shade offered by a scraggly line of trees bordering the highway, a haven for buzzing insects and the occasional weary bird. The overall feeling is one of isolation and relentless, thankless labor.
