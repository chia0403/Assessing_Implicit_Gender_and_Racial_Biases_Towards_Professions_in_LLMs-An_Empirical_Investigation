The scent of beeswax and pressed wool hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma that clung to every thread of Silas Blackwood's existence. Sunlight, fractured by the grimy panes of the shop's single window, painted dancing dust motes across the worn wooden floor.

Across the narrow cobblestone lane, a towering factory ground out gears and pistons, its infernal rhythm a constant reminder of the encroaching machine age. Silas, a staunch traditionalist in a world rapidly embracing the new, often found himself at odds with the times. He preferred the quiet hum of his sewing machine, the satisfying *snick* of his shears, to the deafening roar of progress.
