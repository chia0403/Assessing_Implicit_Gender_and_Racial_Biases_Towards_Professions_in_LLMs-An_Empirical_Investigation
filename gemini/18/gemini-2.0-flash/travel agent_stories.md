The fluorescent lights of "Globetrotter Getaways" hummed a discordant tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Josephine Harding's increasingly frustrating morning. Rain hammered against the plate glass window, blurring the image of a perpetually grey Seattle street into an impressionist mess. Amelia sighed, pushing a stray strand of fiery red hair behind her ear. Another cancellation. Mrs. Higgins, her voice a tremulous whimper on the phone, had decided that a week in the Bahamas was simply too risky with the new "tropical fruit flu" scare. Amelia massaged her temples. It was always something. Volcanoes, political unrest, bird flu, fruit flu… sometimes she felt like she should be selling apocalypse kits instead of all-inclusive resorts. The bell above the door jingled, a hopeful sound breaking through her gloom. A man, dripping rainwater and looking utterly bewildered, stood hesitantly in the doorway. "Globetrotter Getaways?" he asked, his voice a low rumble. "I, uh… I think I need your help escaping reality."
