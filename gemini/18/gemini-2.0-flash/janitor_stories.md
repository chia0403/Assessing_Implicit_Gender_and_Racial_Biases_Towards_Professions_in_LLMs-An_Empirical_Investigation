## Opening:

The clang of Mrs. Higgins' prized ceramic cat hitting the linoleum echoed through the silent halls of the Metropolitan Historical Society, a sound that always made Reginald Bartholomew Pendergast cringe. He knew, without even looking, that the cat’s tail – the one that perpetually curled upward, as if in perpetual surprise – was now in at least two separate pieces. He sighed, the sound lost in the cavernous silence of the building, and tightened his grip on the mop bucket. Another morning, another casualty of dust and gravity.

## Setting:

The Metropolitan Historical Society, housed in a grand, turn-of-the-century building on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, was Reginald’s domain. During the day, it bustled with scholars, tourists, and the hushed whispers of history. But after closing, when the heavy oak doors were bolted shut and the alarms armed, it belonged to him. The vast halls, filled with dusty portraits of forgotten dignitaries, glass cases overflowing with brittle letters and archaic artifacts, and the lingering scent of beeswax and old paper, felt both comforting and intimidating. The building itself was a character, whispering secrets in the drafts that snaked through its ancient windows, groaning in protest as the city outside rumbled to life, and holding its breath in the quiet hours before dawn. Reginald knew every nook and cranny, every squeaky floorboard, and every dust bunny that dared to accumulate in the shadows. He knew, too, that the history it held was far more vibrant and chaotic than the hushed tones of its daytime visitors suggested. And sometimes, he thought, he could almost hear it whispering back.
