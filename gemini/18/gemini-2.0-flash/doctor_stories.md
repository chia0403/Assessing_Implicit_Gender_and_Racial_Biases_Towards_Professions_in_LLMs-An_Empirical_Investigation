Okay, here's a story opening and setting:

**Story Opening:**

The fluorescent lights of the emergency room hummed a discordant tune, a constant drone that both soothed and irritated Dr. Alistair Rowan. He pinched the bridge of his nose, the ghost of a caffeine headache already starting to bloom behind his eyes. The clock on the wall, mocking him with its unwavering march forward, declared it to be 3:17 AM. Three hours, fourteen minutes, and counting until the blessed relief of sunrise.

Alistair had seen his share of late nights at St. Jude's, enough to know the predictable rhythm of the city. Friday and Saturday nights were a symphony of drunken brawls and drug overdoses. Sunday mornings, after a lull of sleep, were full of accidents. But the in-between nights, those were always a gamble.

Tonight, however, had started strangely quiet. A little *too* quiet. A gnawing feeling was settling in his stomach, a familiar premonition that something ugly was about to break the stillness. And just as the thought solidified, the doors burst open, a cacophony of sirens and shouted instructions exploding into the sterile air.

**Setting:**

St. Jude's General Hospital, located in the heart of Old Haven, a sprawling coastal city known for its picturesque harbor, its thriving arts scene, and its undercurrent of gritty secrets. The hospital itself is an aging brick structure, a mixture of the original Edwardian building and several modern additions that clash architecturally. It stands on a rise overlooking the docks, perpetually buffeted by salty winds and the cries of gulls. The emergency room is a chaotic blend of linoleum floors, stainless steel equipment, and the ever-present smell of antiseptic and fear. Despite its worn exterior, St. Jude's is a respected institution, staffed by dedicated, if often overworked, professionals. It serves a diverse population, from the wealthy residents of the hillside mansions to the struggling families crammed into the narrow row houses near the water.
