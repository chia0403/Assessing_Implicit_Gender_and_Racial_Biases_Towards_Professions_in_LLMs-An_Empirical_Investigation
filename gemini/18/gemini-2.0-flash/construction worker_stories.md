The steel girders hummed a low, resonant song, a constant vibration that vibrated up through Johnathan Michael Bell's work boots and settled deep in his bones. He’d been feeling that song for fifteen years, ever since he'd first climbed onto a building site, a green kid with more bravado than sense. Now, at thirty-five, the song felt more like a dull ache, a reminder of the years he’d spent wrestling with gravity and the weight of ambition.

The sun beat down mercilessly on the half-finished skyscraper, baking the already scorching steel. Johnathan squinted, sweat stinging his eyes as he maneuvered the I-beam into place. The air hung thick with the scent of hot metal, diesel fumes, and the constant, grating whine of power tools. Below him, the city of Chicago sprawled, a glittering tapestry of concrete and glass, a testament to human ingenuity, and a playground for those who dared to reach for the sky. They were building the new Meridian Tower, slated to be the second tallest building in the city, a monument to corporate greed and architectural marvel, depending on who you asked. Johnathan didn’t much care about the politics. He just put one beam after another, inching the structure ever higher, a tiny cog in a massive, intricate machine. He felt the weight of his responsibility with every bolt he tightened, with every weld he fused. One mistake up here and the city below wouldn’t just be admiring a marvel. It would be mourning a tragedy.
