**Story Opening:**

Dr. Eleanor Vivian Ainsworth stared out the rain-streaked window of her office, the rhythmic drumming a surprisingly soothing counterpoint to the cacophony brewing within her. A late-afternoon appointment had just cancelled, a blessing and a curse rolled into one. The extra hour meant she could catch up on paperwork, a task perpetually looming like a monstrous, paper-clad Kraken. But it also meant more time to dwell, more time for the questions that gnawed at the edges of her carefully constructed calm. Today, the question was a particularly thorny one: Could a person truly escape their past, or were they forever tethered to the shadows that shaped them?

**Setting:**

Dr. Ainsworth's practice, "Ainsworth Counseling," occupied the second floor of a refurbished Victorian house on Oak Street in the heart of the historic district of Ashwood, a small, affluent town nestled in the foothills of the Berkshire Mountains. The building itself was painted a calming shade of muted sage green, with crisp white trim and overflowing window boxes bursting with vibrant petunias (Eleanor's own touch, a splash of color against the often-gray New England skies). Inside, the waiting room was designed to be as inviting and non-clinical as possible. Plush velvet armchairs in shades of deep teal and burnt orange were arranged around a low coffee table laden with current magazines and art books. A soft, instrumental melody drifted from hidden speakers, and a subtle aroma of lavender and chamomile filled the air. Eleanor's office, while maintaining the same overall aesthetic of comfort and serenity, held a slightly more personal touch. Walls lined with bookshelves overflowing with textbooks, novels, and framed artwork collected over years of travel spoke to her deep intellectual curiosity and her passion for understanding the human condition. A large, comfortable armchair sat opposite her mahogany desk, the surface uncluttered except for a silver-framed photo of her late grandmother, a pen holder fashioned from a piece of driftwood, and a stack of neatly organized patient files.
