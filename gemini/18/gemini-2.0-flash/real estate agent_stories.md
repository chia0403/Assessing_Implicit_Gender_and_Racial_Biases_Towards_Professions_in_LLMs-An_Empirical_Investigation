## Story Opening:

The salt spray bit at Beatrice Eleanor Harding's face as she stood on the crumbling balcony of the property, the ocean wind tugging impatiently at her perfectly coiffed blonde bob. The "For Sale" sign, recently replaced after the last storm ripped it from its moorings, swayed precariously beside her. Beatrice took a deep breath, trying to ignore the dampness seeping through the toes of her sensible heels and the nagging voice in the back of her head that screamed, "This place is a money pit, Beatrice! A glorious, oceanfront money pit!"

But Beatrice Harding wasn't one to back down from a challenge, especially not one that promised a hefty commission. She just needed to find the *right* buyer, the kind who could see past the peeling paint and the questionable foundation to the raw, untamed beauty that was "Seaglass Cottage."

## Setting:

The story is set in the fictional, windswept coastal town of Port Blossom, Maine. Port Blossom is a town of two distinct halves: the charming, tourist-friendly harbor with its quaint shops selling lobster-themed paraphernalia and the rugged, less-visited stretch of coastline dotted with weathered fishing shacks and stubbornly clinging homes like Seaglass Cottage.

Seaglass Cottage itself is perched precariously on a bluff overlooking the Atlantic. It's a two-story, clapboard house, painted a faded seafoam green that's now more algae than paint. The roof sags slightly, the windows are mismatched and cloudy, and the small, overgrown garden is overrun with wild roses and tenacious beach grass. The air smells of salt, damp wood, and the faint, lingering scent of fish. While outwardly charming in a rustic way, a closer inspection reveals the years of neglect and relentless battering from the sea.
