## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The biting November wind whipped around the corner of Dearborn and Monroe, causing Eleanor May Fairbanks to huddle deeper into her vintage tweed coat. Rain, a miserable, persistent drizzle, clung to the already-sullen Chicago landscape. Streetlights buzzed with a sickly yellow glow, reflecting in the slick pavement and the grimy windows of "Finnegan, Stern, and Blackwood," the law firm where Eleanor worked. The building itself was a pre-war behemoth, all imposing grey stone and gothic gargoyles, a stark contrast to the sleek modern towers that were slowly encroaching on its territory. Inside, the air was heavy with the scent of old money, beeswax polish, and the quiet despair of lawyers billing by the hour.

**Opening:** Eleanor May Fairbanks sighed, watching another soaked figure sprint past the window. It was six o'clock, and the relentless hum of the office was finally beginning to wind down. She'd already covered her typewriter (a hulking Smith Corona from the Eisenhower era, stubbornly beloved by Mr. Finnegan) and neatly stacked the day's correspondence in the "OUT" tray. The only light came from her desk lamp, casting a warm, almost theatrical glow on her face as she carefully applied a fresh coat of crimson lipstick. The receptionist at Finnegan, Stern, and Blackwood was expected to maintain a certain… air of respectability. And Eleanor, despite her secret yearning for something more exciting than answering phones and routing angry divorcees, took pride in exceeding those expectations. Tonight, however, something felt different. A prickle of unease had been nagging at the back of her mind all day, a subtle discordance in the otherwise predictable symphony of the office. It wasn't the usual anxiety that came with balancing the firm's temperamental partners; it was something… else. She glanced at the grandfather clock ticking solemnly in the corner. Six o'clock. Right on schedule. But tonight, the pendulum seemed to swing with a heavier, more ominous rhythm. And just as the thought crossed her mind, the telephone on her desk, which had been silent for the past half-hour, let out a shrill, demanding ring that sliced through the quiet like a shard of ice.
