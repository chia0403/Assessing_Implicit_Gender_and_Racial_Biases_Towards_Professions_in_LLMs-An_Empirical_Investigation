**Opening:**

The scent of chlorine hung heavy in the air, a familiar, almost comforting aroma to Dr. Eleanor Rose Hawthorne. It usually masked the other smells – the antiseptic, the lingering sweat of a thousand workouts, the fear that clung to some patients like a second skin. But today, even the chlorine couldn't quite conquer the pervasive funk of burnt popcorn. Eleanor sighed, adjusting her name tag that read, "Eleanor Hawthorne, DPT." It was only 7:15 AM, and judging by the smell emanating from the physical therapy gym, Mrs. Gable was already having one of her…days.

**Setting:**

The story is set in a bustling outpatient physical therapy clinic, "Optimal Motion Rehabilitation Center," in the affluent suburb of Oak Haven, Connecticut. The clinic itself is modern and well-equipped, boasting state-of-the-art rehabilitation equipment, a heated therapy pool visible through a large observation window, and brightly colored walls meant to inspire hope and healing. Sunlight streams through the large windows, illuminating polished wooden floors and creating a somewhat sterile, yet professional, atmosphere. Outside, meticulously manicured lawns and blooming hydrangeas line the driveway, a stark contrast to the sometimes messy realities of physical recovery that unfold within its walls.
