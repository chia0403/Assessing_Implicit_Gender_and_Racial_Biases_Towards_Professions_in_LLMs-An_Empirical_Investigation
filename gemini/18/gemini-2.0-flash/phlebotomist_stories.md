Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a phlebotomist:

**Setting:** The St. Jude's Medical Center, a sprawling, older hospital complex in the heart of Baltimore. Sunlight, filtered through the grimy windows of the fourth-floor lab, cast long, dusty beams across the linoleum floor. The air hummed with the constant whir of centrifuges and the hushed murmur of conversations. Sinks gurgled, instruments clinked, and the faint antiseptic scent mingled with the lingering aroma of microwaved tuna salad.

**Opening:**

Eleanor Grace Ainsworth hated Tuesdays. It wasn't just the double-shift she was pulling; it was the sheer volume of patients, each one a unique puzzle of veins and anxieties. As a phlebotomist at St. Jude's, Eleanor was the first line of defense against the unknown, the ambassador of bodily fluids. Today, however, the waiting room overflowed, a cacophony of coughs, whispered complaints, and the rustle of outdated magazines.

Taking a deep breath, Eleanor adjusted the elastic band of her hairnet and glanced at the towering stack of lab requisitions in her inbox. Type 2 diabetic glucose testing, lipid panels, routine CBCs, STAT troponins... the list seemed endless. With a sigh, she grabbed the first chart â€“ a Mr. Herbert Finch, apparently terrified of needles - and pasted on her most reassuring smile. "Alright, let's get to work," she muttered under her breath, steeling herself for another long, and probably very messy, Tuesday at St. Jude's.
