## Opening:

The rhythmic thud of hooves against damp earth vibrated through Dr. Eleanor Astrid Finch's wellington boots. She squinted, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair from her face, her breath misting in the crisp autumn air. The frantic call had come just before dawn â€“ a prized Clydesdale, belonging to old Mr. Abernathy, was in distress. A knot of dread tightened in her stomach. Abernathy's Clydesdales were legendary; gentle giants with feathered feet and placid eyes. To see one struggling meant something was seriously wrong.

## Setting:

The story opens in the rural, windswept countryside of the Scottish Highlands, specifically on a working farm nestled in the shadow of Ben Nevis. The farm, Abernathy Acres, is a sprawling patchwork of emerald green pastures, dotted with sturdy stone barns and ancient drystone walls. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth, peat smoke rising from the farmhouse chimney, and the faint, earthy aroma of livestock. The landscape is rugged and beautiful, painted in the vibrant hues of autumn - russet browns, fiery oranges, and the deep greens of the evergreen forests clinging to the lower slopes of the mountain. The weather is typically unpredictable, swinging between sunshine, showers, and a chilling wind that whips down from the peaks, reminding everyone of the harsh winter that is looming.
