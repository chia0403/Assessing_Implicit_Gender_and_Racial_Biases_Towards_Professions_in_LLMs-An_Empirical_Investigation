The scent of eucalyptus and something vaguely antiseptic hung in the air, a potent cocktail meant to soothe frayed nerves and convince patients they were entering a haven of healing. Dr. Amelia Grace Hawthorne took a deep breath, letting the familiar aroma fill her lungs as she unlocked the door to Hawthorne Chiropractic. It was 6:45 AM, and the pre-dawn light painted long, gray fingers across the floor of her office.

Hawthorne Chiropractic, nestled in the heart of the historic district of Oakhaven, Pennsylvania, occupied the ground floor of a converted Victorian house. The peeling paint of the exterior was a source of constant irritation to Amelia, but the landlords, the notoriously frugal McAllister twins, refused to budge on any major renovations. Inside, however, Amelia had crafted a tranquil space. Soft, instrumental music, usually Debussy or Satie, played on a loop. Comfortable armchairs flanked a low table displaying dog-eared copies of *National Geographic* and *Backpacker* magazine. And, of course, there were the obligatory anatomical charts of the human spine plastered tastefully to the walls, strategically placed behind ferns and calming landscape paintings.

Outside, Oakhaven was slowly waking. The rhythmic clatter of Mr. Abernathy's newspaper delivery echoed in the still morning air. A single, lonely streetlamp cast a weak circle of light on the cobblestone street. Soon, the aroma of Mrs. Higgins' bakery next door would waft through the cracks in the old building, battling for olfactory dominance with Amelia's eucalyptus blend.

Amelia flipped on the lights, revealing the polished wood of her adjusting table and the gleaming chrome of her activator instruments. She glanced at the appointment book, a slightly worn leather-bound volume that held the key to her day, to her livelihood, and, sometimes, it felt, to the tangled anxieties of Oakhaven itself. Today promised a mix of the usual suspects: Mrs. Donahue with her chronic lower back pain, young Ethan Miller, the high school quarterback with a sore shoulder, and, of course, Mayor Thompson, whose back always flared up before a big town hall meeting.

But something in the quiet stillness of the morning, in the way the light caught the dust motes dancing in the air, suggested that today might bring more than just the usual aches and pains. Today felt...different.
