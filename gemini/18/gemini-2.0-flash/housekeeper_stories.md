The chipped ceramic mug warmed the palms of Maria Elena Rodriguez, the only comfort she allowed herself before the day truly began. Through the frosted kitchen window, the skeletal branches of the ancient oak outside looked like frozen lightning against the pale dawn sky. Here, on the sprawling estate of Willow Creek Manor, dawn was not a gentle thing. It was a stark, silent unveiling of all the work that awaited her, a promise whispered on the biting wind that snaked through the ancient cracks in the building's stone facade.

Willow Creek Manor, nestled deep in the Pennsylvania countryside, was a beast of a house. Three stories of imposing gray stone, punctuated by dark, brooding windows that seemed to perpetually glare. It was a place of echoes and shadows, of forgotten corners and hidden stories. The kind of house where you could get lost even knowing its floor plan intimately, which Maria Elena, after five years, did.

The house belonged to the late Elias Blackwood, a reclusive historian rumored to have amassed a fortune from his controversial theories on American history. He had died peacefully in his study, surrounded by stacks of crumbling manuscripts and the faint scent of pipe tobacco, leaving the manor to his only surviving relative, his niece, a young woman named Seraphina. Seraphina, who flitted through the house like a ghost, rarely spoke, and seemed to possess an unsettling habit of staring directly through Maria Elena.

Maria Elena took a final, fortifying sip of her lukewarm coffee. It was going to be a long day. The dust never slept at Willow Creek Manor, and neither, it seemed, did the secrets buried within its walls.
