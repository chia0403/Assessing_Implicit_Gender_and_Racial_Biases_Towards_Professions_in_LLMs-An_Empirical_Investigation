The salt spray tasted metallic on Jedediah "Jed" Blackwood's lips, a familiar tang he'd come to associate with the endless expanse of the Pacific. The sun, a molten orange coin, dipped low on the horizon, painting the cab of his rig, "The Wanderer," in fiery hues. Inside, the air crackled with static from the CB radio and the comforting scent of burnt coffee and leather.

He was hauling a load of Alaskan King Crab down Highway 101, hugging the Oregon coast. The road, a serpentine ribbon carved into the cliffs, offered breathtaking views that Jed, even after years behind the wheel, never tired of. Below, the surf pounded against jagged rocks, sending plumes of white foam skyward. Above, gnarled pines clawed at the wind, their silhouettes stark against the fading light.

Jed adjusted the brim of his well-worn baseball cap, the logo of a long-defunct logging company barely visible. He'd picked it up at a dusty truck stop in Montana years ago and it had become as much a part of him as the calluses on his hands. He ran a hand over his salt-and-pepper beard, feeling the rough stubble scratch against his palm. Another long night ahead, another hundred miles before he could find a decent truck stop and grab a few hours of sleep. The crab wouldn't keep itself cold, and deadlines, as Jed knew all too well, were as unforgiving as the Oregon coast itself.
