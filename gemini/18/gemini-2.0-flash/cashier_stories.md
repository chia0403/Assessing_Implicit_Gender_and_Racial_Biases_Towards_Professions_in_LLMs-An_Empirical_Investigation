The fluorescent lights of the Quick Stop flickered, casting a jittery, pale glow across the aisles of candy bars and dusty magazines. Outside, the August heat pressed down on Harmony Heights like a damp blanket, promising another sweltering day. Inside, the air conditioning hummed a weary tune, barely keeping pace with the relentless assault.

Behind the counter, her chin propped on a hand adorned with a faded temporary tattoo of a butterfly, sat **Penelope Willowbrook**. Her nametag, perpetually slightly askew, proclaimed her title to the world: CASHIER. Penelope sighed, pushing a strand of auburn hair behind her ear. The morning rush had subsided, leaving a lull punctuated only by the rhythmic whirring of the lottery machine and the occasional buzzing of a fly trapped between the window and the promotional poster for energy drinks. Sheâ€™d already scanned Mrs. Higgins' scratch-off ticket (a loser, as usual), sold a pack of cigarettes to a teenager who looked suspiciously older than he claimed, and had a philosophical debate with Mr. Peterson about the merits of different brands of chewing tobacco.

Penelope stared out the dusty window, watching the heat shimmer off the blacktop. She dreamt of escaping Harmony Heights, of shedding the mantle of "Cashier Penelope," and becoming something... more. Something other than a cog in the machine of late-night snacks and lottery tickets. She just didn't know what "more" was yet.
