Okay, here's a story opening with a guard named Elias Thorne:

**Setting:** The crumbling, lichen-covered ramparts of Blackwood Keep, nestled high in the perpetually mist-shrouded peaks of the Serpent's Tooth Mountains. Blackwood Keep had seen better days, many better days, back when the Kingdom of Northwood controlled the region. Now, it was little more than a forgotten outpost, clinging to the edge of the world, held precariously by a skeletal garrison and shadowed by legends of ancient, malevolent forces said to dwell in the winding, unexplored tunnels beneath its foundations.

**Opening:**

The wind, a relentless, teeth-chattering thing that seemed to carry the whispers of the mountains themselves, whipped Elias Thorne's threadbare cloak around him. He pulled it tighter, its thin wool offering scant protection against the biting chill. Another gust, and Elias swore he could taste the snow, even though it hadn't fallen in weeks. Below, the jagged cliffs plunged into a sea of swirling fog, obscuring the forest that clung desperately to the mountainside. It was a landscape of stark beauty, if one could ignore the persistent feeling of being watched.

Elias, his face weathered and lined beyond his twenty-eight years, leaned heavily on his halberd, the polished steel cold against his calloused hands. He'd been pacing this section of the ramparts, a rhythmic march against the creeping boredom and the gnawing anxiety that always seemed to find him on the night watch. Three years he’d served at Blackwood Keep, three years of staring into the abyss, waiting for… something. A raid? A monster from the depths? More likely, he suspected, nothing. Just the slow, agonizing decay of forgotten duty. Still, he couldn’t shake the prickling sensation on the back of his neck, the feeling that tonight, something was different. Something was coming.
