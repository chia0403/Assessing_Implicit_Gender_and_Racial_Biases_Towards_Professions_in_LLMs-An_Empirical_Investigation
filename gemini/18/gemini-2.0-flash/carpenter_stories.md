## Opening:

The air in the workshop was thick with the scent of pine and sawdust, a comforting, familiar aroma that usually soothed Silas Blackwood’s anxieties. But not today. Today, the scent clung to him like a shroud, a constant reminder of the silence that had fallen over everything. His mallet lay discarded on the workbench, its head stained crimson from a recent project, a detail he usually wouldn’t have noticed, but now, it felt like a premonition. He stared out the dusty window, past the stacks of lumber and the rusting tools, at the grey, unforgiving sea. The storm was coming, he could feel it in his bones, a mirroring of the tempest brewing inside him. He hadn't seen Amelia in three days. Three days of relentless knocking, unanswered calls, and the gnawing fear that something terrible had happened.

## Setting:

The story is set in the quaint, isolated fishing village of Saltwind Cove, nestled on the rugged coastline of Maine. The village is small, comprised mainly of weathered clapboard houses clinging to the craggy cliffs, their foundations constantly battered by the Atlantic. The heart of the village is the small harbor, where brightly colored fishing boats bob and sway, waiting for their next voyage. Silas Blackwood's workshop, a sturdy, two-story building painted a faded blue, sits on the outskirts of town, overlooking the sea. Inside, the workshop is a testament to Silas's life - organized chaos. Tools hang neatly on the walls, categorized by use and age. Sketches and blueprints are scattered across the workbench, intermingled with half-finished projects and discarded scraps of wood. The air is always filled with the sounds of sawing, hammering, and sanding, a constant, rhythmic heartbeat that usually signifies the life and vitality of the village. However, these sounds are absent today, replaced only by the ominous roar of the approaching storm.
