The smell of hot metal and burning oil mingled with the faint, earthy scent of creosote, a familiar perfume in this harsh, beautiful land.  Elias adjusted his faded John Deere cap, his gaze sweeping over the desolate expanse, his hand instinctively reaching for the worn leather strap of his water bottle.  This wasn't glamorous work, but it was honest, and Elias, despite the heat and the dust, felt a quiet satisfaction in the raw power he commanded.
