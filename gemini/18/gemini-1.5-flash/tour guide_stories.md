The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of frangipani and something faintly…rotten.  Amelia Hernandez, her name a whisper against the cacophony of cicadas, adjusted the brim of her wide-brimmed hat, shielding her eyes from the relentless glare of the Costa Rican sun.  Sweat beaded on her forehead, a familiar discomfort in the oppressive heat of the rainforest.  Before her, a motley crew of tourists – a gaggle of giggling teenagers, a stoic German couple clutching a well-worn phrasebook, and a lone, suspiciously tanned gentleman who seemed more interested in the foliage than the tour – shuffled expectantly, their faces a mixture of anticipation and apprehension.  This was no ordinary rainforest trek; this was the infamous Serpent's Path, a notoriously challenging hike through the heart of the Manuel Antonio National Park, famed for its breathtaking beauty and equally breathtaking…wildlife.
