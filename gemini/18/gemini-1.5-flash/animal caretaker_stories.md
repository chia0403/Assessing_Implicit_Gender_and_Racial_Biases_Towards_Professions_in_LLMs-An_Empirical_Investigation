The pre-dawn chill clung to Elias Thorne’s worn overalls as he navigated the labyrinthine corridors of the Whispering Pines Wildlife Sanctuary.  Mist, thick as spun moonlight, hung heavy in the air, clinging to the gnarled branches of ancient oaks that clawed at the perimeter fence.  The only sounds were the rhythmic drip of condensation from the metal roof of the primate enclosure and the soft, guttural chuffs emanating from within – the contented sighs of his charges, a troop of critically endangered orangutans.  Elias, his breath misting in the frigid air, reached into his pocket for his thermos of strong, black coffee, the familiar warmth a welcome counterpoint to the damp chill that seemed to seep into his very bones.  The sanctuary, nestled deep within the redwood forests of Northern California, was his world, a haven he guarded with a fierce, quiet devotion.
