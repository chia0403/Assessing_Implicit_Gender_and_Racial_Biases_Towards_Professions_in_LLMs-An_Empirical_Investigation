The biting Antarctic wind howled like a banshee, tearing at the reinforced fabric of Dr. Aris Thorneâ€™s parka.  Ice crystals, sharp as shards of glass, stung his exposed cheeks despite the balaclava pulled tight over his face.  He adjusted the oxygen mask, the metallic tang of the recycled air a familiar comfort against the brutal chill.  Aris Thorne, PhD in glaciology and lead researcher on the Lazarus Project, hunched deeper into the wind, his breath misting in the frigid air.  The desolate expanse of the Larsen C ice shelf stretched before him, a landscape of brutal beauty, sculpted by millennia of relentless ice and wind.  Above, the bruised purple of the Antarctic twilight painted the sky, a stark contrast to the blinding white of the ice that stretched to the horizon, an unbroken, unforgiving expanse.  The only sound, besides the wind, was the rhythmic crunch of his boots on the ice, a fragile counterpoint to the monumental scale of his surroundings.  This was no ordinary research expedition; this was a race against time, against the melting ice, and against something far more sinister lurking beneath the frozen surface.
