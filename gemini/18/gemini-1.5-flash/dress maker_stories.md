The scent of lavender and old silk hung heavy in the air, a comforting perfume that clung to the dust motes dancing in the afternoon sunbeams slanting through the tall, arched windows of Madame Evangeline Dubois's atelier.  Evangeline, a woman whose age was as carefully concealed as the intricate seams in her most exquisite gowns, sat hunched over a bolt of shimmering sapphire silk, her nimble fingers flying across the fabric like a hummingbird's wings.  The atelier itself, tucked away on a cobbled side street in the heart of 1920s Paris, was a testament to her artistry: walls lined with bolts of vibrant fabric, mannequins draped in half-finished creations, and sketches pinned haphazardly to every available surface, a chaotic yet strangely harmonious explosion of colour and creativity.  Outside, the city hummed with the energy of a bustling metropolis, but within these four walls, time seemed to slow, surrendering to the rhythmic whisper of needle and thread.
