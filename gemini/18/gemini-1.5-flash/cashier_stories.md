The fluorescent lights of "Quick Stop Mart" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Grace Hawthorne's increasingly tedious evening.  Amelia, or Amy as most people called her – though she preferred the formality of her full name when dealing with the public, a small rebellion against the blandness of her life – stared blankly at the rotating display of discounted candy bars.  Outside, a relentless November rain hammered against the grimy windows, mirroring the relentless monotony of scanning groceries and receiving the occasional surly glare from a customer irritated by a slightly overripe avocado.  The air hung thick with the cloying sweetness of cheap air freshener and the lingering scent of stale coffee, a potent cocktail only slightly less depressing than the prospect of another six hours of this.  The Quick Stop Mart, nestled on the edge of a perpetually overcast town named Havenwood, felt less like a convenient store and more like a purgatory for the perpetually underemployed.
