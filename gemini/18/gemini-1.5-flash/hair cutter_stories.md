The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a peculiar but familiar perfume in Aurelia "Reli" Blackwood's salon. Reli, her fingers nimble and precise as she snipped a stray strand from Mrs. Henderson's perfectly coiffed bob, glanced up at the rain lashing against the mismatched windowpanes of "Shear Bliss," her quaint little shop nestled on the cobbled side street of Seabrook.  Seabrook itself was a town clinging stubbornly to the cliff edge, its houses a jumble of grey slate and weathered timber, constantly battling the relentless Atlantic winds that howled a mournful symphony just beyond the salon's walls.  The storm, Reli noted with a practiced eye, was brewing something fierce â€“ the kind that could send tourists scurrying for cover and leave the town eerily quiet, a perfect backdrop for the secrets Seabrook held close to its salty heart.
