The rasping shriek of metal on metal sliced through the pre-dawn stillness, a sound Elias Thorne, Jr. knew intimately.  It wasn't the screech of brakes, or a car crash â€“ those were sharp, sudden. This was a low, grinding moan, the sound of a pothole swallowing another unsuspecting tire.  Elias, bundled in layers of orange against the October chill clinging to the shoulder of Interstate 70, squinted at the ribbon of asphalt stretching before him, a vast, dark canvas punctuated only by the occasional flicker of distant headlights.  The air hung heavy with the scent of diesel and damp earth, a familiar perfume of his life, a life spent patching the arteries of America's relentless highway system, one pothole, one crack, one broken guardrail at a time.  This particular stretch, just outside of Salida, Colorado, was notorious; a treacherous dance between towering mountains and a river that seemed determined to undermine the road's very foundation.  The sun, a pale blush on the eastern horizon, promised little warmth against the biting wind.  Another day, another battle against the relentless decay of the road.
