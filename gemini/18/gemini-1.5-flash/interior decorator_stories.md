The chipped paint on the windowsill, a faded robin's egg blue that clashed violently with the aggressively orange brickwork, was the first thing Aurelia "Relia" Hawthorne noticed.  It wasn't the peeling wallpaper, the dust motes dancing in the slivers of afternoon sun, or even the lingering scent of damp earth and something vaguely…animalistic. No, it was the windowsill.  Relia, owner of Hawthorne & Hues Interior Design,  had an almost supernatural ability to spot the single, most crucial detail that dictated the entire aesthetic of a space, and this neglected sliver of paint was screaming at her.  She stood on the threshold of the crumbling Victorian townhouse, a dilapidated jewel box nestled amongst the bustling, modern streets of Notting Hill, its once-grand façade now overshadowed by aggressively trendy boutiques and coffee shops.  The air hung heavy with the promise of rain and the melancholic sigh of a city holding its breath before a storm.  This wasn't a simple redecoration; this was a rescue mission.
