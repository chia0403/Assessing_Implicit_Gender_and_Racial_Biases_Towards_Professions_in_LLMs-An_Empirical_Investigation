The chipped porcelain teacup warmed Amelia Blackwood’s fingers, a fragile counterpoint to the icy November wind rattling the single-paned windows of her tiny, attic apartment.  Rain lashed against the slates, mimicking the tempestuous rhythm of the blues song she'd been working on all afternoon – a song that felt as raw and exposed as the peeling paint on the walls.  The air hung thick with the scent of damp wool and brewing coffee, a familiar aroma that clung to the worn velvet armchair where she’d spent countless hours crafting melodies and lyrics, her faithful, battered acoustic guitar resting beside her.  From her perch overlooking the cobbled streets of  Edinburgh’s Old Town, the gas lamps flickered like dying stars, casting long, dancing shadows across the ancient stones below. Tonight, however, Amelia wasn't composing. Tonight, she was waiting.  Waiting for a phone call that could change everything.
