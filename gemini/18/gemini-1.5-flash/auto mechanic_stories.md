The grease-stained overalls of Elias Thorne felt like a second skin, the smell of motor oil a comforting perfume after twenty years spent wrestling with temperamental engines.  His workshop, Thorne's Tune-Ups, nestled precariously between a laundromat perpetually smelling of bleach and a pawn shop displaying a disturbing collection of taxidermied animals, was a chaotic symphony of clanking metal, hissing air, and the low hum of electricity.  Sunlight, fractured by grimy windows, illuminated dust motes dancing in the air, each one a tiny, glittering testament to countless hours spent coaxing life back into broken-down machines. The air hung thick and warm, a blend of burnt rubber, motor fluid, and the faint, sweet scent of spilled soda â€“ a testament to Elias's multitasking abilities, or lack thereof, depending on your perspective.  Today, however, the usual comforting chaos felt amplified, charged with a nervous energy that even the rhythmic thump of his trusty air compressor couldn't quite quell.  A job was on the line, a job that could either save his struggling business or send it spiraling into the very same junkyard he frequently sourced parts from.
