The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of frangipani and impending rain.  Cicadas buzzed a relentless, throbbing rhythm against the backdrop of crashing waves that pounded the volcanic black sand beach.  Isabelle “Izzy” Moreau, renowned director of gritty, award-winning independent films, squinted at the monitor, the flickering light painting fleeting shadows across her already tired face.  The scene – a tense confrontation between a jaded detective and a ruthless cartel boss – was proving stubbornly elusive.  The location, a crumbling, once-grand hacienda overlooking the Pacific Ocean on the remote Costa Rican island of Isla Tortuga, was breathtaking, but the oppressive heat and the ever-present threat of a sudden downpour were testing even Izzy’s considerable patience.  This was supposed to be her triumphant return to form, her masterpiece, but right now, it felt more like a slow-motion shipwreck.
