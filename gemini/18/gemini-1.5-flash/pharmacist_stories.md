The bell above the door of "Apothecary's Choice" jingled a discordant welcome, the sound swallowed by the persistent hum of the refrigerator unit in the back.  Dust motes, illuminated by the weak afternoon sun slanting through the grimy windowpanes, danced in the air like tiny, exhausted fireflies.  Amelia Katherine Finch, owner and sole pharmacist of this quaint, if somewhat dilapidated, establishment nestled on the edge of Willow Creek, sighed.  The scent of lavender and sandalwood, usually a comfort, tonight felt heavy, almost suffocating, mirroring the weight settling in her chest.  Outside, the relentless November rain lashed against the panes, mirroring the storm brewing inside her.  Amelia straightened the already meticulously arranged bottles of tinctures, the rhythmic action a small rebellion against the unease that threatened to overwhelm her.  Tonight, something feltâ€¦ different.  The usual quiet solitude of her apothecary was punctuated by an unsettling stillness, a pregnant silence that promised trouble.
