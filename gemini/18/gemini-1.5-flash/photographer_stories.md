The biting November wind whipped Amelia Jane Holloway’s hair across her face, stinging her cheeks a vibrant crimson that clashed spectacularly with the muted greys of the Scottish Highlands.  She tugged her thick wool scarf tighter, the rough knit scratching against her chin, a small discomfort she barely registered.  All her attention was focused on the scene before her:  Eilean Donan Castle, its ancient stones brooding dramatically against a sky the colour of bruised plums, the tumultuous waves of Loch Duich churning at its base like a restless beast.  The air hung thick with the scent of salt spray and damp earth, a perfume both bracing and melancholic, perfectly mirroring the mood that had settled over Amelia since she'd arrived in Scotland a week ago.  This wasn't a tourist trip; this was a pilgrimage, a desperate attempt to reconnect with something she’d lost – not just a loved one, but a part of herself she feared she might never find again.  Her camera, a trusty Leica M6 hanging heavy around her neck, felt cold and unresponsive, reflecting the icy chill in her heart.  She needed a photograph, a masterpiece even, to capture the raw, untamed beauty of this landscape and, perhaps, to salvage a piece of her own shattered soul.
