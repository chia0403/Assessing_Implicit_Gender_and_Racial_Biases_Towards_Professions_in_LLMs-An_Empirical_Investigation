The scent of woodsmoke and damp wool hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Elias Thorne, Master Tailor of Oakhaven.  His shop, nestled in a crooked alleyway between the bustling fish market and the equally bustling apothecary, was a haven of quiet industry. Sunlight, filtered through the grimy panes of the single, arched window, illuminated motes of dust dancing in the shafts of light, each one a miniature sun in Elias's dimly lit world.  Needles and thread, spools of vibrant silks and somber velvets, spilled from overflowing drawers and precarious stacks upon the worn workbench.  The rhythmic snip-snip-snip of Elias's shears, a constant counterpoint to the cacophony of the town beyond, was the only sound that truly felt like home.
