The salt spray stung Aurelia Blackwood's face, a familiar kiss from the unforgiving Atlantic.  She braced herself against the relentless wind, her oils slick with the same grey-green hues that dominated the churning sea before her.  The cliffs of Cornwall, jagged teeth gnawing at the sky, were her studio today, a raw, untamed canvas far exceeding anything she could create within the confines of her London flat.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and seaweed, carried the mournful cry of gulls, a soundtrack to the tempest brewing both within her and without.  Aurelia, her fingers numb despite the thick wool mittens, adjusted the easel, the wind threatening to topple it into the frothing abyss below.  This painting, she knew, would be a battle fought not just with brush and pigment, but against the very elements themselves.
