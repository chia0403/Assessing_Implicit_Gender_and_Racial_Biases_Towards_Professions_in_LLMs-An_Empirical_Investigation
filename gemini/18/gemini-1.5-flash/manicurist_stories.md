The scent of acetone and lavender hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Evangeline “Evie” Moreau.  It clung to her like a second skin, mingling with the faint, metallic tang of blood – a surprisingly common companion in her line of work.  Evie meticulously filed the edge of a chipped nail, the rhythmic rasp a counterpoint to the incessant chatter spilling from the television mounted in the corner of her tiny salon, "Nails by Evie," nestled incongruously between a laundromat and a bodega on the grittier edge of the vibrant, chaotic East Village.  Rain lashed against the windowpanes, blurring the neon signs into a kaleidoscope of hazy colours, reflecting in the polished surface of the manicure table.  Tonight, however, the usual urban symphony was punctuated by an unnerving silence, broken only by the scrape of her file and the frantic drumming of her own heart.  Something felt…off.
