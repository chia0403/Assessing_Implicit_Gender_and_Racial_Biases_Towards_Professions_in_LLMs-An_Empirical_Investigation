The stale smell of chlorine and sweat hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Amelia “Amy” Katherine Davies.  Amy, a woman whose biceps could curdle milk and whose smile could melt glaciers (though she preferred the former effect in the gym), surveyed her Zumba class with a practiced eye.  The fluorescent lights of “FitLife Fitness Centre” hummed a monotonous tune, casting a pale glow on the slightly-too-enthusiastic dancers – a motley crew of retirees, stay-at-home mums, and a surprisingly dedicated accountant who always wore a novelty sweatband.  Outside, the relentless Manchester drizzle lashed against the windows, a stark contrast to the vibrant Latin rhythms pulsing through the room.  Tonight, however, something felt… off. A nervous energy thrummed beneath the usual pre-class chatter, a discordant note in the otherwise upbeat atmosphere. Amy’s sharp gaze, honed by years of spotting bad form and even worse excuses, locked onto a new face lurking near the back, a figure shrouded in shadow.
