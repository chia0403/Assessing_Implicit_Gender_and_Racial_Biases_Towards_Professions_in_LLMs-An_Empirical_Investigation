The biting November wind whipped Amelia Katherine Holloway’s auburn hair across her face as she wrestled the canvas onto the easel.  Her breath plumed out in ragged white clouds, instantly freezing in the frigid air.  The skeletal branches of the ancient oak, clawing at the bruised twilight sky above, mirrored the turmoil churning within her.  She was perched precariously on a windswept cliff overlooking the churning grey expanse of the Atlantic, the unforgiving ocean roaring its displeasure at the encroaching darkness. The air tasted of salt and the faint, melancholic scent of decaying seaweed.  Amelia shivered, not entirely from the cold. This was her sanctuary, her torment, her muse – the wild, untamed beauty of the Cornish coastline, a landscape as volatile and unpredictable as her own artistic soul.
