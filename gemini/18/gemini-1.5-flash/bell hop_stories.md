The brass spittoon gleamed under the flickering gaslight, reflecting the weary slump of Archibald "Archie" Finch's shoulders.  The air in the Grand Majestic Hotel lobby hung thick with the cloying scent of lilies, expensive cigars, and something vaguely unsettling â€“ a metallic tang that hinted at spilled blood, or perhaps just the lingering aroma of a poorly cleaned silver service. Archie, a bellhop of impeccable if slightly rumpled attire, adjusted the worn leather strap of his luggage cart, the weight of a single, battered steamer trunk a comforting counterpoint to the oppressive stillness of the late-night hour. Rain lashed against the vast arched windows, blurring the already indistinct cityscape of 1920s New Orleans into a watercolor of shadowy spires and gaslit streets.  The only sound louder than the downpour was the rhythmic tick-tock of the enormous grandfather clock in the corner, each second a hammer blow against the tense silence.
