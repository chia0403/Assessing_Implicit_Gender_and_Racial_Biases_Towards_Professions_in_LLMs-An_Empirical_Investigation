The scent of lilies, heavy and sweet, hung thick in the air, a fragrant counterpoint to the biting November wind rattling the panes of  Willow Creek Florist.  Rain lashed against the window, blurring the already twilight landscape into a smudged watercolour of grey and black.  Inside, however, a warm, amber glow illuminated Amelia Rose Hawthorne, her fingers deftly weaving together sprays of deep crimson roses and frosted eucalyptus. Amelia, with her auburn hair pulled back in a messy bun and flecks of emerald green paint clinging to her apron, was a whirlwind of controlled chaos, a symphony of snips and sighs as she prepared a funeral arrangement.  The shop itself, tucked away on a quiet cobbled street in the ancient, seaside town of Port Blossom, was a haven of floral beauty â€“ a riot of colour and fragrance that somehow managed to feel both comforting and profoundly melancholic.
