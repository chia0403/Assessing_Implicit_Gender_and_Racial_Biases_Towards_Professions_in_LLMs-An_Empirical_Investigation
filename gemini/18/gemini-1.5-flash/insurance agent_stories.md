The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Hernandez’s hands, doing little to thaw the icy November air that seeped through the gaps in the window frame of her small, cluttered office.  Rain lashed against the panes, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  Amelia, a woman whose smile lines betrayed a far more vibrant personality than her current, pinched expression suggested, stared out at the sodden streets of Port Blossom, Washington.

Amelia, a seasoned insurance agent with a knack for navigating the complexities of human lives and even more complex policies, felt a prickle of unease she couldn't quite explain.  It wasn't just the late hour, or the relentless rain, but something far more… unsettling about Silas Blackwood and his claim.
