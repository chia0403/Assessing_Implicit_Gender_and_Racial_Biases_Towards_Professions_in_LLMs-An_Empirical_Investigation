The scent of coconut oil and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a perfume only Isabelle “Izzy” Moreau truly appreciated.  Izzy, a cosmetologist with fingers as nimble as a hummingbird’s wings and a spirit as fiery as the ginger highlights she often painted onto her clients’ hair, surveyed her domain:  "Izzy's Indulgence," a tiny salon tucked away on a cobbled side street in the ancient, quirky French Quarter of New Orleans.  Rain, the kind that splattered against the tall, wrought-iron balconies and smelled of jasmine and impending hurricanes, lashed against the single window, obscuring the already fading gaslight outside. Inside, however, the salon glowed warmly, a haven of flickering candlelight, plush velvet armchairs, and the low hum of vintage hair dryers. Tonight, though, the usual calming tranquility was shattered.  A frantic knock echoed through the room, followed by a desperate, muffled cry.
