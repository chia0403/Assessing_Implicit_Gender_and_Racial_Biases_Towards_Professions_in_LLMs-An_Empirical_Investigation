The November wind howled a mournful dirge around the craggy peaks of the Mourne Mountains, mirroring the unease churning in Dr. Alistair Finch’s stomach.  His Land Rover Defender, affectionately nicknamed "The Beast" by his patients, struggled up the last, icy incline towards the remote village of Glencoe.  Headlights cut through the swirling snow, illuminating the stark, unforgiving beauty of the landscape.  The only sounds besides the wind were the rhythmic crunch of tires on the packed snow and the occasional, unsettling creak of the ageing vehicle.  Glencoe, nestled deep in the valley, was a place of breathtaking scenery and equally breathtaking isolation – a fact Alistair was acutely aware of as he gripped the steering wheel, the last twenty miles a blur of white knuckles and muttered anxieties.  This wasn't a typical house call; this was a plea for help that had sounded far more desperate than any toothache.
