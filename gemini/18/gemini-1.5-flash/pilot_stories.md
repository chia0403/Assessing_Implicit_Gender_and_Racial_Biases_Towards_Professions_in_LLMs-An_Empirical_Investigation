The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful song around Captain Evelyn "Evie" Reed's battered Cessna 185, the metal groaning a counterpoint to the storm’s fury.  Below, the Chugach Mountains clawed at the bruised, twilight sky, their snow-laden peaks shrouded in a swirling vortex of snow and grey.  Visibility was down to near zero, the only illumination coming from the intermittent, frantic blinks of the aircraft's instruments and the ethereal glow of the aurora borealis dancing erratically in the distance – a breathtaking, yet utterly terrifying, spectacle.  Evie gripped the yoke, her knuckles white against the worn leather, her breath misting in the frigid cockpit.  The radio crackled with static, a mocking reminder of her isolation in this unforgiving wilderness.  Tonight, getting home wasn't just a flight; it was a fight for survival.
