The salt spray stung Dr. Elara Vance's face as she wrestled the stubborn fishing net onto the deck of the *Sea Serpent*.  The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum sinking towards the churning grey horizon, cast long shadows across the small, battered vessel.  The air, thick with the smell of brine and diesel, vibrated with the low thrum of the engine.  Around her, the vast expanse of the North Atlantic stretched out, a relentless, unforgiving canvas painted in shades of steel and slate.  Elara, her dark hair plastered to her forehead beneath a worn woolen cap, wasn't usually one for fishing trips, but this wasn't your average recreational jaunt.  This was a medical emergency, miles from the nearest land, and she was the only doctor, or rather, the only physician's assistant, for a hundred nautical miles.
