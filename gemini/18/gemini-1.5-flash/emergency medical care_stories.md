The wail of the siren was a lullaby Elias Thorne, Jr. knew intimately.  It sliced through the humid Charleston night air, a stark counterpoint to the rhythmic chirp of crickets and the distant foghorn moaning its mournful song across the Cooper River.  Rain, slick and relentless, plastered Eliasâ€™s dark hair to his forehead as he gripped the steering wheel of the Charleston County Emergency Medical Services ambulance, its flashing lights painting the rain-streaked asphalt in strobing crimson and blue.  The city, normally a tapestry of historic charm, was tonight a blur of glistening wet brick and shadowy alleyways, each one concealing the potential for unseen peril.  Elias, his brow furrowed with professional concentration, navigated the treacherous streets, the emergency lights reflecting in the anxious eyes of his partner,  Paramedic Sarah Chen, beside him.  Their destination: a reported stabbing at the docks, a place known more for its shadowy dealings than its picturesque views.
