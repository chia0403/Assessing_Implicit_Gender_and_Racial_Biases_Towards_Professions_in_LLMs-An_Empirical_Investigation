The scent of aged paper and leather hung heavy in the air, a comforting perfume to Eleanor Vance, Head Librarian of the Blackwood Memorial Library.  Dust motes, illuminated by the late afternoon sun slanting through the arched gothic windows, danced in the stillness of the grand reading room.  Outside, a November wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the stained-glass panels depicting forgotten saints and mythical creatures.  Inside, however, a profound quiet reigned, broken only by the occasional rustle of turning pages and the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner, its pendulum a metronome marking the slow, deliberate passage of time within the hallowed halls of Blackwood.  Eleanor, perched on a rolling ladder amidst towering shelves filled with the accumulated wisdom of centuries, adjusted her spectacles and ran a gloved finger along the spine of a particularly ancient volume bound in cracked vellum.  Tonight, she suspected, the quiet would be broken.  A shadowed figure had been lurking near the library's entrance for the past three evenings, and tonight, Eleanor sensed, he wouldn't be satisfied with just lurking.
