The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Featherstonehaugh’s fingers, the lukewarm tea doing little to thaw the icy grip of the November wind that howled outside the window of her tiny office.  Rain lashed against the grimy panes, blurring the already indistinct gaslight glow of the cobbled street below.

Her office, perched precariously on the third floor of a crumbling building in the grimy heart of Blackfriars, London, smelled faintly of dust, old paper, and the lingering scent of burnt coffee from a particularly disastrous attempt at breakfast earlier that morning.  The only decoration was a faded botanical print of a particularly prickly thistle, a strangely apt symbol for the thorny dealings of her clientele.  Tonight, however, the usual humdrum of numbers felt unusually heavy, a premonition of something… unsettling.
