The scent of rosemary and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume only Aurelia “Ria” Blackwood could create.  Ria, perched on a worn, velvet stool behind her salon chair, expertly snipped a strand of auburn hair, her brow furrowed in concentration.  Her salon, "Shear Genius," wasn't exactly glamorous. Nestled on a cobbled side street in the perpetually twilight town of Oakhaven, it was a charmingly ramshackle space, its walls adorned with mismatched vintage mirrors reflecting the flickering gaslight that illuminated the street outside.  Rain lashed against the mismatched windowpanes, adding a melancholic rhythm to the rhythmic snip-snip of her shears.  Oakhaven itself was a town steeped in secrets, its ancient buildings whispering stories of forgotten magic and long-dead romances, a fitting backdrop for the unconventional life Ria led, a life about to be turned upside down.
