The humid Georgia air hung heavy, thick with the scent of frying onions and simmering collard greens.  Cicadas buzzed a relentless soundtrack to the evening rush at Mama Rose's Soul Food Kitchen, a low-slung building painted a faded yellow that had seen better days, but somehow still radiated warmth.  Steam rose from the chipped Formica countertops, blurring the already hazy reflections of the flickering neon sign outside.  Amelia Jeannette "Mia" Dubois, her name a whispered promise of Southern grace barely contained beneath a whirlwind of activity, expertly navigated the crowded dining room.  Her crisp white uniform, miraculously free of a single grease stain, was a stark contrast to the chaotic energy swirling around her.  A clatter of silverware, the rumble of low conversation, and the rhythmic clanging of pots from the kitchen all formed a familiar, comforting symphony for Mia, the heartbeat of Mama Rose's.
