The chipped paint of the fire escape flaked onto Amelia Grace Hawthorne's worn leather notebook, mirroring the crumbling state of the tenement building before her.  Rain, a greasy, insistent drizzle, slicked the cobblestones of Mulberry Street, reflecting the neon glow of a nearby bodega in fractured, shimmering shards.  The air hung heavy with the scent of frying onions, damp concrete, and something indefinably…rotten.  Amelia, a reporter for the *New York Chronicle*, adjusted her trench coat, its collar pulled high against the chill wind, and peered into the shadowed alleyway below.  The flickering gaslight barely illuminated the scene, but even from this distance, the stark white of a discarded sheet, stained crimson, was unmistakable.  This wasn't just another late-night scuffle; this was something far more…sinister.
