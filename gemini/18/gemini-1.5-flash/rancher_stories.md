The wind, a rasping, unforgiving hand, clawed at Elias Thorne’s weathered face as he surveyed his land.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of ochre and red, danced across the parched earth of the Broken Bow Ranch, swirling like malevolent spirits against the bruised purple backdrop of the approaching storm.  The sky, usually a vibrant Arizona blue, was choked with a bruised, angry purple, mirroring the tension tightening in Elias's own gut.  Broken Bow, a sprawling expanse of scrub brush, prickly pear cactus, and stubbornly clinging mesquite trees, was in the grip of a drought unlike any he’d seen in his fifty-two years.  The cattle, usually a robust, lowing herd, were gaunt shadows of their former selves, their ribs starkly visible beneath their dusty hides.  Even the usually boisterous crows seemed subdued, their caws reduced to a mournful croak.  This wasn't just a dry spell; this was a fight for survival, and Elias Thorne, hardened rancher and son of the land, knew he was facing the toughest battle of his life.
