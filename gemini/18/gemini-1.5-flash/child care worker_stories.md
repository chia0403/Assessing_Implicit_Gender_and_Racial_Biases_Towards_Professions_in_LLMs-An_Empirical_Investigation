The chipped paint of the "Sunshine Smiles Daycare" sign flaked onto the already overgrown petunias, mirroring the general state of disrepair that clung to the building like stubborn morning mist.  Twenty-year-old Elara Vance, her bright yellow cardigan slightly rumpled from a frantic morning chase after a rogue toddler armed with a glitter glue stick, sighed.  The damp October air hung heavy with the scent of woodsmoke and something vaguely resembling burnt toast â€“ a familiar perfume in the chaotic, yet oddly comforting, world of Sunshine Smiles.  Inside, the sounds of tiny feet pounding on the hardwood floors and the shrill cries of a teething infant formed a discordant lullaby that Elara had somehow learned to both tolerate and find endearing.
