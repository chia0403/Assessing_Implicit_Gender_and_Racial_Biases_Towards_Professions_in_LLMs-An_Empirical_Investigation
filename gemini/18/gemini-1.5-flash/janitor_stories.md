The fluorescent lights of the Blackwood Academy gymnasium hummed a discordant tune, a soundtrack to Elias Thorne’s nightly ritual.  Dust motes, illuminated like tiny, dancing stars, swirled in the beams as Elias, a man whose shoulders stooped under the weight of fifty years and countless spilled sodas, pushed a mop across the polished maple floor.  The air hung heavy with the lingering scent of sweat, cheap gym shoes, and the faint, almost imperceptible aroma of lemon cleaner – Elias’s signature blend, a testament to his unwavering dedication to his craft.  Blackwood Academy, a gothic monstrosity of crumbling brick and shadowed corners, stood silent except for the rhythmic squeak of his mop and the occasional creak of the ancient bleachers.  Tonight, however, the silence felt different, thicker, pregnant with an unspoken unease that even Elias, a man accustomed to the eerie quiet of the night, couldn't ignore.
