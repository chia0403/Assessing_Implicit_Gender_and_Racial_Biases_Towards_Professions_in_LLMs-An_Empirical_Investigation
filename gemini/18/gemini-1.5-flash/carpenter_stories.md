The salt-laced wind whipped Elias Thorne's grey hair across his weathered face as he surveyed the half-built boathouse.  The North Sea, a churning, restless beast, roared against the craggy cliffs of Cornwall, spitting spray that stung his eyes.  The air hung thick with the scent of brine and pine, a familiar perfume to Elias, a carpenter whose life was as intimately bound to the sea as the barnacles clinging to the rocks below.  His calloused hands, gnarled and strong from decades of shaping wood, instinctively went to the worn leather of his work apron, its pockets bulging with nails, chisels, and a well-loved pipe.  The grey stone of the boathouse, rough-hewn and defiant against the elements, mirrored the stubbornness in Elias's own heart, a heart that had weathered as many storms as the unforgiving coast itself.
