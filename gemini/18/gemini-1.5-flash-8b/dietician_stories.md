The biting chill of the January wind whipped Amelia Josephine "Amy" Cartwright's scarf tighter around her neck as she stepped from the sterile white confines of the hospital cafeteria.  The scent of pine needles and damp earth hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the antiseptic aroma she'd been surrounded by all day.  Amy, a registered dietitian with a master's in nutritional therapy, found herself strangely drawn to the whispering pines that bordered the hospital grounds.  It wasn't the typical solace she sought – a quiet cup of herbal tea in her sun-drenched apartment – but something more… urgent.  She traced the frost patterns on the window pane of the nearby clinic, the intricate designs mirroring the complex dietary needs of the patients she'd just consulted with.  Each patient, a unique puzzle, a different set of nutritional challenges needing her expertise, demanding her patience.  This particular evening, though, the puzzle felt… incomplete.

Setting: A small, quiet, and slightly dilapidated town nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains during the frosty depths of a January evening.  The clinic, a worn-down brick structure with peeling paint, stood on the edge of a forest.  The air was crisp, carrying the scent of pine and damp earth.  A sprinkling of snow dusted the ground, contrasting with the muted colours of the winter landscape.
