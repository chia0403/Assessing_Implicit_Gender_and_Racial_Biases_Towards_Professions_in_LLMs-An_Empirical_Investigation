The biting wind, a relentless Siberian serpent, whipped at Amelia Petrova's flight suit as she wrestled the controls of the "Northern Star."  The vast, featureless expanse of the Arctic Ocean stretched before her, a canvas of bruised grey and churning whitecaps.  Icy needles of spray stung her face, threatening to obscure the flickering HUD display that projected a fragile map of the search zone.  Her breath fogged in a white cloud around her, mingling with the howl of the wind that seemed to echo the desperate questions swirling in her mind.

The year was 2042.  The 'Northern Star,' a modified, high-altitude reconnaissance drone, was Amelia's domain.  The vast, icy expanse of the high Arctic, where the sky bled into the sea and the world seemed to end, was her office.  The frozen wastelands, usually devoid of life, pulsed with a quiet, unseen energy, one that Amelia, a veteran pilot of the Global Arctic Reconnaissance Corps (GARC), felt keenly. A chill that went beyond the cold, a subtle yet palpable dread that settled deep within her bones.  The mission was simple, yet the stakes were monumental: locate the lost expedition of Dr. Anya Petrova, her estranged mother, and her team of pioneering climatologists.
