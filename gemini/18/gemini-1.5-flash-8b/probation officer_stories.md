Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the probation office, a relentless rhythm that mirrored the pounding in Amelia "Amy"  Ashworth's head.  The fluorescent lights flickered, casting an eerie glow on the overflowing files stacked haphazardly on her desk.  Empty coffee cups, each a testament to a sleepless night, sat clustered around a half-eaten sandwich.  The scent of stale paper and cheap coffee hung heavy in the air, a familiar aroma of her life for the past three years.  Amy, a probation officer in the gritty, industrial heart of Portland, Oregon, stared at the latest report, a single sheet detailing another broken promise, another failed attempt at redemption.  Outside, the relentless rain continued its relentless song, a soundtrack to the city's unspoken anxieties.

The probation office, a repurposed warehouse on the edge of the city's forgotten district, smelled of mildew and damp concrete.  Dusty, peeling paint clung to the walls, and faded posters of local community programs adorned the chipped linoleum floors.  This was no gleaming courthouse; this was a forgotten corner, reflecting the neglected corners of lives Amy worked to navigate.  The city lights bled onto the rain-slicked streets outside, casting long, distorted shadows, like the fractured hopes of the individuals entrusted to her care.
