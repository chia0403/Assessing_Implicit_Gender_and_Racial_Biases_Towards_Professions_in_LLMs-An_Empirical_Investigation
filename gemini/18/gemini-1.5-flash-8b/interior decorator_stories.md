The scent of aged parchment and freshly-cut cedar hung heavy in the air, a familiar symphony to Amelia Hawthorne, Interior Decorator Extraordinary.  Her tiny, cluttered studio, tucked away on a cobbled street in the heart of the decaying yet captivating Quarter, was a testament to her passion and, perhaps, her slightly chaotic nature.  Stacks of vintage fabrics, draped over antique furniture, mingled with half-finished sketches and overflowing tins of paint swatches.  Sunlight, filtered through stained-glass windows above, cast a kaleidoscope of colours on the worn wooden floor, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air.  Amelia, a whirlwind of focused energy in a faded floral print dress, traced a delicate line on a blueprint with a pencil, her brow furrowed in concentration.  Outside, the rhythmic clang of a blacksmith's hammer echoed through the narrow alleyways, a persistent counterpoint to the quiet hum of her creative process.
