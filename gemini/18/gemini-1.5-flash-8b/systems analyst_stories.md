The fluorescent hum of the server room was a constant, almost imperceptible, lullaby to Elias Thorne, Systems Analyst.  He wasn't exactly lulled into a trance, though.  His focus, laser-sharp, was entirely on the blinking lights and the rhythmic whirring of the cooling fans.  Each LED danced a unique code, a silent symphony of data flowing through the interconnected veins of the global network.  Elias, in his crisp, charcoal-grey shirt and meticulously pressed slacks, felt a prickle of unease.  The symphony was off-key.

The setting was the subterranean nerve center of 'OmniCorp,' a sprawling metropolis of towering glass and steel, a company that dictated the digital rhythm of the world.  Below the shimmering city skyline, nestled within the labyrinthine depths of OmniCorp's headquarters, lay the server room.  Rows upon rows of gleaming metal cabinets hummed, silent sentinels guarding the digital heart of the corporation.  The air, thick with the scent of ozone and stale server coolant, held a palpable tension, a feeling Elias, despite his analytical nature, couldn't quite quantify.  He knew something was amiss.  Not a single data breach, not a malfunctioning server, but...something more fundamental.  Something like the underlying code of existence had shifted, subtly but alarmingly.
