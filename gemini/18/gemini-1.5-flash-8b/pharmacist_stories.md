The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Apothecary's Corner" hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the steady, rhythmic click-clack of Amelia Josephine Blackwood's fingers as she meticulously sorted vials.  The air, thick with the scent of lavender and antiseptic, hung heavy in the small, almost claustrophobic, space.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight that pierced the grime-coated window, illuminating a spiderweb draped across the corner of the shelves like a macabre lacework.  Amelia, a woman of unassuming stature with eyes the color of faded amethyst, traced the fine lines etched into the labels, her brow furrowed in concentration.  Behind the counter, a decades-old wooden display case, filled with jars overflowing with exotic and forgotten remedies, cast long, dancing shadows.  Tonight, however, the usual gentle murmur of the small town of Willow Creek had fallen silent, replaced by an unnerving stillness, a premonition of somethingâ€¦wrong.  Her usual evening routine, the quiet hum of her work, the rhythmic ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner of her cluttered office, was disturbed by a singular, jarring, and persistent tremor.  It was a tremor that felt more internal than external, like an echo in the hollow of her bones.
