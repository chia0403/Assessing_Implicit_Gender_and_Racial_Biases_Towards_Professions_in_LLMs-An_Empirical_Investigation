The chill of November snaked through the alley, clinging to the damp brick walls and seeping into the very marrow of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield.  Barty, a butcher with hands weathered like ancient maps and eyes that held the glint of a thousand butchered haunches, shivered, pulling his threadbare coat tighter around him.  He wasn't used to this kind of cold, not in the heart of  Old Oakhaven.  This particular alley, a forgotten cul-de-sac choked by overflowing bins and the skeletal remains of last summer's sunflowers, was his sanctuary, his unofficial workshop.  Tonight, however, it felt less like refuge and more like a tomb.

The setting was the heart of Old Oakhaven, a town carved from the deep, ancient woods that clawed at the horizon.  Cobbled streets, lined with shops displaying wares from dried mushrooms to hand-forged tools, twisted and turned like the branches of a gnarled oak tree.  The air, thick with the scent of woodsmoke and roasting meats, was punctuated by the melodic clang of blacksmiths' hammers and the hushed murmur of gossiping housewives.  Bartyâ€™s small, independent butcher shop, "Butterfield's Blows," was nestled at the foot of a steep hill, just beyond the clamor of the marketplace.  Yet, the alley, obscured from the bustling market square, offered a sense of quiet isolation, a place where Barty could both lose himself and find his inner strength.
