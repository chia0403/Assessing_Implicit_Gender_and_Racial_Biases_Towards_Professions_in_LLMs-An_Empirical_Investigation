The biting wind, a relentless, icy knife, whipped across the desolate expanse of the I-95 median.  Dust devils, swirling remnants of the previous day's passing trucks, danced across the cracked asphalt.  Sunrise, a pale, anemic thing, barely pierced the bruised sky, casting long, skeletal shadows across the highway's shoulder.  This was Amelia "Milly"  Kingston's domain.  For the past five years, Milly, a highway maintenance worker with the Maryland Department of Transportation, had patrolled this stretch of the interstate, a lonely sentinel in a land of relentless, unyielding concrete.   Her worn, faded DOT jacket, the faded orange a testament to countless hours spent in the unforgiving chill, provided little warmth against the biting wind.  Each morning, the highway, a ribbon of grey, seemed to hold its breath, waiting for the inevitable symphony of screeching metal and throbbing engines that would soon thunder through the pre-dawn hours.
