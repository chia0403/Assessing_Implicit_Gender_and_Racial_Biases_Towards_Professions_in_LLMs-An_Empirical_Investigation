The chipped porcelain sink, perpetually stained with the faintest whisper of rust, reflected the pale moonlight filtering through the grime-streaked windowpanes.  Dust motes danced in the ethereal glow, swirling like tiny, spectral ballerinas.  Agnes Periwinkle, her starched uniform whispering a silent testament to her meticulous nature, meticulously scrubbed a stubborn smear of peanut butter from the kitchen counter.  The scent of old books and lavender, remnants of the previous occupants, clung to the air, a faint but comforting aroma in the otherwise silent house.  The air hung heavy with the quiet expectancy of the night, and Agnes, despite the rhythmic clatter of her sponge against the countertop, felt a prickle of unease. This house, the Blackwood Manor, had a history, a history whispered in the creaking timbers and the sighing of the wind through its ancient oaks.  It wasn't just a house; it was a custodian of secrets, and tonight, Agnes sensed those secrets were stirring.

**Setting:** Blackwood Manor, a grand, sprawling Victorian house nestled deep within the whispering woods surrounding the small town of Oakhaven.  The house itself seemed to absorb the surrounding gloom, its many windows like watchful eyes staring out into the shadowy wilderness.  Shadows danced on the overgrown lawn, and the faintest rustling of unseen creatures punctuated the stillness.  The house had seen better days, but its grandeur was undeniable, a testament to a forgotten era of opulence.  Inside, the rooms were vast and cavernous, filled with the lingering ghosts of former residents and the pervasive smell of dust and decay.
