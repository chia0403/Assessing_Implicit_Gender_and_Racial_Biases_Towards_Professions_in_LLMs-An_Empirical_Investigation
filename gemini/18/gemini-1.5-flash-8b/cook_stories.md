The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual grey-brown from years of spilled sauces and forgotten dishes, reflected the flickering gaslight above Amelia "Em"  Featherstone's head.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light, illuminating the greasy grime clinging to the worn wooden counter, a testament to the relentless rhythm of the bustling "Golden Spoon" kitchen.  Steam, thick and fragrant with the promise of roasted chicken and simmering vegetables, hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint scent of lavender from a forgotten bouquet on the windowsill.  Em, her dark hair pulled back in a tight braid, wrestled with a stubborn, stubbornly uncooperative chicken leg, the rhythmic clack of her knife against bone the only sound in the otherwise hushed space.  Outside, the cobblestone streets of Old Southwark echoed with the distant rumble of carts and the cries of hawkers, a familiar symphony to Em, but tonight, it seemed particularly loud, particularly unsettling. The Golden Spoon, usually a beacon of warm camaraderie, felt strangely still.
