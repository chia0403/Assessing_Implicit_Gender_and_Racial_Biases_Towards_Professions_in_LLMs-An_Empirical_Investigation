The scent of honeysuckle, sharp and sweet, clung to the air around Amelia Seraphina Bloom's tiny shop, "Blooming Delights."  Sunlight, filtered through the lace-curtained windows, painted the interior in a soft, golden glow.  Dust motes danced in the beams, illuminating the vibrant displays of lilies, roses, and orchids that adorned every surface.  Amelia, with her perpetually rosy cheeks and hair the colour of spun moonlight, meticulously arranged a bouquet of pale blue forget-me-nots, her nimble fingers tracing the delicate petals.  Outside, the clatter of horse-drawn carriages and the cries of street vendors mingled with the gentle hum of the city.  It was a Tuesday afternoon in late August, 1888, in the bustling heart of London, England.
