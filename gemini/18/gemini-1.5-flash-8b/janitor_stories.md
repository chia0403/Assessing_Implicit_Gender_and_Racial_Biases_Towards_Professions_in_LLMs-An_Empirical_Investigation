The flickering fluorescent lights of the Grand Zenith Institute hummed a mournful dirge, casting long, skeletal shadows across the polished floors.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight piercing the grime-coated window of the abandoned astrophysics lab.  This was the domain of Silas Blackwood, janitor.  Silas, a man whose weathered face bore the imprint of countless late nights scrubbing and mopping, adjusted his worn cleaning gloves, his breath misting in the frigid air.  The Institute, once a beacon of scientific brilliance, was now a mausoleum of forgotten theorems and discarded dreams.  Empty offices, lined with decaying filing cabinets and dust-coated equipment, whispered of forgotten discoveries and lost futures.  The rhythmic squeak of his mop on the polished stone echoed through the cavernous halls, a lonely soundtrack to the fading grandeur.
