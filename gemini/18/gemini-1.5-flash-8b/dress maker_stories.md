The chipped porcelain doll, eyes like faded amethyst, stared blankly at the swirling patterns on the fabric spread across Elara Seraphina’s worktable.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun piercing the grimy window of her tiny workshop, illuminating the intricate floral embroidery she was meticulously tracing.  The scent of beeswax and old parchment hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort, a comforting reminder of the quiet life she had carved out for herself.

Elara Seraphina, a dressmaker of renown, or perhaps whispered renown amongst the shadowed alleyways and tucked-away taverns of the city, had dedicated her life to the art of draping and designing garments, each stitch a tiny act of rebellion against the monotonous drudgery that she believed encompassed the lives of most women.  Her workshop, tucked away behind the Grand Weaver’s Guild, was a labyrinth of rustling fabrics, overflowing sewing baskets, and the hushed murmur of her own thoughts, a space where she could shape and mold the world into beauty, at least for the brief hours she worked at her craft.
