Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the abandoned warehouse, a relentless drumming that mirrored the frantic rhythm in Dr. Eleanor Vance's head.  The air hung thick with the smell of mildew and something else, something acrid and metallic that clung to the back of her throat.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom, illuminating a scene that should have been impossible, yet was undeniably real.  This wasn't a crime scene; it was a nightmare manifested in steel and shattered glass.  The abandoned warehouse, a rusted skeleton of a former auto-parts store, stood on the edge of the forgotten industrial district, its neglected fa√ßade swallowed by the encroaching ivy and the relentless, grey fog that clung to the city like a shroud.  The rain, an unrelenting curtain, muffled the distant rumble of the city, creating an eerie silence punctuated only by the drip-drip-drip of water and the desperate, ragged breathing of Dr. Vance.
