The chipped paint of the gazebo's balustrade, a faded, sickly yellow, scraped against Elara Nightingale's gloved fingers.  She adjusted the small trowel, its metal cool against her palm, and gazed out at the meticulously manicured lawns of Blackwood Manor.  The estate, sprawled across acres of emerald green, shimmered under the afternoon sun.  Even from where she stood, hunched beneath the watchful gaze of the weathered stone lions flanking the entrance, the oppressive grandeur of the place pressed down on her.  Elara, a groundskeeper for Blackwood Manor for the past ten years, knew the sprawling gardens like the lines in her own palms.  Yet, a shiver ran down her spine, not from the unexpected chill in the air, but from a sense of foreboding that clung to the place like mildew.  The silence was thick, heavy with unspoken secrets, and the rustling of leaves seemed to whisper tales she wasn't ready to hear.

The setting was Blackwood Manor, a sprawling estate nestled deep within the whispering woods of Ashwood County.  Ivy climbed the imposing stone walls, obscuring the view of the grey stone facade that mirrored the gloom of the surrounding forest.  The air, thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, felt almost suffocating compared to the usual summer breeze.  Sunbeams, fractured by the dense canopy, cast long, dancing shadows across the manicured lawns and winding paths, creating an eerie stillness.  The silence was punctuated only by the rhythmic chirp of crickets and the distant, mournful hooting of an owl, both seeming to mock the oppressive quiet.  Elara, surrounded by this unsettling beauty, felt utterly alone.
