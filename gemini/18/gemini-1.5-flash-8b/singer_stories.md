The chipped paint of the "Golden Harp" clung to the building like a stubborn lover, mirroring the persistent ache in Elara Nightingaleâ€™s heart.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single, flickering neon sign above the door, danced in the humid air of the back alley.  It was a Tuesday night, the kind where the city breathed a sigh of resignation, the only music coming from the distant hum of traffic and the occasional, mournful wail of a street musician.  Elara, a singer with eyes the colour of twilight and a voice that could melt glaciers, felt the familiar pang of loneliness, a constant companion in the shadows of her otherwise dazzling career.

The Golden Harp, a dimly lit, forgotten haven for local musicians and forgotten dreams, was her stage. Tonight, the only audience was a single figure hunched over a chipped mahogany table, a figure lost in the swirling smoke of a cigarette.  Elara, clad in a worn velvet dress that had seen better days, took a deep breath.  Tonight, she wouldn't just sing; she'd sing for the ghost of a forgotten song.
