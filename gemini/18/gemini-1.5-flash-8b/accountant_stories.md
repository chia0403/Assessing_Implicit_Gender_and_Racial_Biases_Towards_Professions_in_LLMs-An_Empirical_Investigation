The fluorescent lights of the accounting firm, "Numbers & Nuggets," hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic clicking of Amelia Butterfieldâ€™s keyboard.  Amelia, a meticulous accountant with a penchant for perfectly organized spreadsheets and even more perfectly sharpened pencils, stared at the monstrous spreadsheet on her screen.  Rows upon rows of numbers stretched endlessly, each representing a transaction, a sale, a payment, a meticulously documented piece of the intricate financial puzzle she was tasked with solving.  It was a Tuesday, the middle of October, and the air in the office, though artificially warmed by the building's HVAC system, felt heavy with unspoken anxieties.  Outside, the crisp autumn air carried the scent of decaying leaves and impending winter. Amelia, bundled in a sweater despite the heat, felt a familiar chill creep up her spine. This wasn't just another month-end report. This was different.  Something felt...off.

The setting:  The bustling yet oddly quiet city of Oakhaven, nestled between the towering skyscrapers of the corporate district and the sprawling residential neighborhoods.  Numbers & Nuggets was situated in a small, slightly dilapidated office building on a side street, its faded paint and chipped window sills reflecting the muted autumn colors. The smell of stale coffee and printer toner hung thick in the air, punctuated by the occasional, sharp metallic tang of the nearby train tracks.
