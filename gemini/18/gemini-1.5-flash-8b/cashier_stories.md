The fluorescent lights of the "Everything Under the Sun" supermarket hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia Nightingale's life.  The air, thick with the scent of stale bread and vaguely tropical fruit, hung heavy in the early-morning chill.  Rows of identical metal shelves, meticulously stocked with brightly-wrapped goods, stretched before her, a seemingly endless expanse of consumerism. Amelia, a young woman with eyes the colour of faded amethyst, stared blankly at the barcode scanner, a weary sigh escaping her lips.  It was Tuesday, the day the pre-dawn shoppers came, the ones who judged you by the speed at which you rang up their slightly bruised avocados and suspiciously limp lettuce.  This was her life: the rhythmic click-clack of the scanner, the endless stream of mundane transactions, the quiet desperation of knowing this was the routine that shaped the whole of her weeks.
