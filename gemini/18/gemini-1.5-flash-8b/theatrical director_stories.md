The scent of aged wood and stale popcorn clung to the air, a familiar miasma in the shadowed corners of the Grand Theatre.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon light piercing the gloom, illuminating the intricate carvings of the proscenium arch, now more symbolic than functional.  This was the final rehearsal for "The Tempest," and  Director Amelia Nightingale, a woman whose eyes held the fire of a thousand stage pyres, felt the familiar knot tighten in her stomach.  The play was almost ready. Almost.  Almost was a concept that had haunted her for the last three weeks. The actors, some talented, some stubbornly resistant, had been her canvas, and she, the ruthless yet passionate sculptor.  Tonight, she hoped the final brushstrokes would coalesce into something truly magnificent.

The theatre, a grand dame of the early 20th century, stood on a street that had once buzzed with life, but now seemed to sigh in the perpetual twilight.  The city, a sprawling metropolis built on the promise of the future, had forgotten the hushed grandeur that still whispered within these ancient walls.  Rain, the usual harbinger of the city's temper, hammered against the antiquated glass panes, a rhythmic counterpoint to the restless energy swirling inside.  Amelia, wrapped in a heavy, velvet cloak, traced a finger along the chipped edge of a stage prop â€“ a weathered, weathered oak staff, its once polished surface dull with time and neglect.  She needed this to be perfect.  She needed *it* to speak.
