The flickering fluorescent lights cast long, distorted shadows across the cluttered desk, highlighting the half-eaten takeout containers and the mountain of case files that seemed to grow taller with each passing hour.  The air hung thick with the smell of stale coffee and desperation, a scent familiar to Izzy, a constant companion in the gritty, unforgiving city of Veridian.  Veridian, a metropolis built on the bones of ambition and buried secrets, a place where the sun rarely touched the grime-coated streets, mirroring the despair often found within its people.  It was a city of shadows, and Izzy, a detective in its underbelly, was a creature of the night.
