The rain hammered against the sculpted stone facade of the Grand Chateau de la Fleur, a rhythmic drumming that seemed to echo the frantic thumping in Amelia Dubois' chest.  The year was 1928.  Paris, usually a vibrant tapestry of light and colour, was shrouded in a sullen grey.  Amelia, a concierge with eyes the colour of polished onyx and a perpetually composed demeanor, stood sentinel in the opulent lobby, a stark contrast to the tempest raging outside.  A single, flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the polished parquet floor, illuminating the swirling patterns of dust motes clinging to the humid air.  The scent of lilies and old leather hung heavy in the stillness, a stark juxtaposition to the relentless patter of the rain.  Each drop, a tiny hammer blow on the fragile silence.

The Grand Chateau de la Fleur was a monument to opulence, a testament to the grandeur of the Belle Époque.  But even within its gilded walls, a sense of foreboding clung to the air.  Recent whispers had circulated among the staff – stories of a missing guest, a cryptic note, and a shadowy figure lurking in the shadows of the grand ballroom. Amelia, with her uncanny ability to piece together fragments of information, felt the threads of the mystery tighten around her, pulling her into the heart of a hidden drama.
