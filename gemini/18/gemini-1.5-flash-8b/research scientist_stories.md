The humid air hung thick and heavy, a suffocating blanket draped over the sprawling, bioluminescent fungal forests of Xylos.  Dr. Aris Thorne, a research scientist with the Xylos Institute of Bio-Adaptation, adjusted his bio-luminescent goggles, the faint green light reflecting in the glistening, iridescent spores that carpeted the forest floor.  Rain, the constant, rhythmic percussion of Xylos' unique ecosystem, hammered down on the corrugated metal roof of the mobile research station, "The Whisperwind."  Each drop echoed with a low, resonant hum, a sound that both unnerved and fascinated Aris.  Inside, the air-conditioned lab buzzed with the low thrum of specialized machinery, a symphony of whirring fans and the soft hiss of fluid transfer systems.  The station, a self-sufficient mobile lab, was the only refuge from the ever-present danger of the shifting fungal growth and the unknown creatures it harbored.  Xylos, a planet teetering on the edge of a fungal apocalypse, held its secrets close, secrets Aris was determined to unravel.
