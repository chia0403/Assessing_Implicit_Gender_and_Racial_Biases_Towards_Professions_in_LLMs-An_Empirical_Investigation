The biting wind whipped Dr. Anya Petrova's coat around her legs as she stared at the skeletal remains of a stag, its antlers, once majestic, now fractured and brittle against the grey, windswept moor.  The air, thick with the scent of pine and something faintly metallic, hung heavy in her lungs.  This wasn't the pristine, manicured landscape of the animal clinic nestled in the valley.  This was the untamed heart of the Scottish Highlands, a place where ancient stones whispered secrets to the wind and the wild held sway.  Sheâ€™d come to this remote, isolated glen for a routine check-up on a particularly stubborn herd of Highland cattle, but the cryptic nature of this stag's death had drawn her in, an irresistible pull towards the unknown. The jagged peaks of the surrounding mountains, shrouded in mist, loomed like colossal, watchful guardians over the valley.  A shiver, more than just the chill of the air, prickled at her skin.  The silence, broken only by the mournful cry of a distant eagle, felt oddly oppressive.  Anya, a veterinarian with an insatiable curiosity for the natural world, felt a prickle of unease in her bones.  Her sturdy boots crunched on the frost-covered earth as she approached the clearing, the stark beauty of the landscape only intensifying her unease. This was no ordinary case.
