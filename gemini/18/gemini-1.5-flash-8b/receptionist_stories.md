The fluorescent lights of the Zenith Corporation headquarters hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia Nightingale's day.  The air, thick with the scent of stale coffee and recycled paper, hung heavy in the cavernous reception area.  Rows of identical beige cubicles stretched into the distance, swallowed by the oppressive silence of the workday.  Amelia, a petite woman with perpetually tired eyes and a smile that clung to her face like a second skin, meticulously arranged a stack of incoming mail.  Each crisp sheet, bearing the Zenith logo in bold, black print, felt like a tiny, paper weight, pressing down on her already weary spirit.  Today was no different from any other day at Zenith.  A day of endless paperwork, polite inquiries, and the occasional disgruntled client.
