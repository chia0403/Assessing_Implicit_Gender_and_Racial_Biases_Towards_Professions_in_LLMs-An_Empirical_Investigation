The chipped Formica countertop reflected the fluorescent hum of the waiting room, a dull, echoing counterpoint to the frantic rhythm of Elara Vance's thoughts.  Dr. Elara Vance, counseling psychologist, meticulously organized the stacks of papers on her desk: session notes, referral forms, and the ubiquitous "Consent for Treatment" forms, each one a miniature battlefield of potential anxieties.  Rain hammered against the single pane window, a relentless percussion that mirrored the storm brewing within her.  It was a Tuesday, and the approaching holiday season brought with it its own peculiar anxieties.

The waiting room, small and sterile, smelled faintly of antiseptic and stale coffee.  A half-eaten bowl of granola sat abandoned on a side table, a lonely testament to the hurried breakfasts of anxious souls.  Sunlight, weak and pale, struggled to pierce the grime-coated windowpanes.  A single, brightly colored poster of a happy family, plastered to the wall, felt jarringly out of place amidst the general air of simmering tension.  Today's session was a young woman named Maya, referred by her mother with a worry etched across her face as deep as the worry lines etched around her own.  The weight of Maya's unspoken struggles pressed down on Elara like a physical burden, the kind that left her shoulders aching long after the session had ended.
