The chipped Formica countertop gleamed under the harsh fluorescent lights of the "Accounting Angels" office, reflecting Amelia Peabody's weary eyes.  Rain hammered against the grimy windowpane, mirroring the relentless rhythm of the numbers cascading across the spreadsheets on her laptop.  Paper, a symphony of receipts, invoices, and meticulously-filled ledgers, piled precariously high on the shelves flanking her desk.  The air, thick with the scent of stale coffee and despair, hung heavy.  Amelia, a bookkeeper of undeniable competence yet surprising sadness, had just hit another milestone in her seemingly endless audit.  This one, for the perpetually-optimistic but financially-unsteady "Whimsical Widgets," felt like a particularly thorny thicket.  The year-end numbers were a nightmare, and the pressure to meet the deadline loomed over her like a threatening storm cloud.


**Setting:** A small, cramped office tucked away on a side street in the bustling city of Oakhaven.  The office, despite its functional layout, felt more like a war zone for spreadsheets than a place of business.  The fluorescent lights, although providing a necessary light source, exacerbated the feeling of monotony. Outside, the dreary urban landscape, characterized by towering buildings and the relentless grey of the city's underbelly, contrasted starkly with the muted colours within the office.
