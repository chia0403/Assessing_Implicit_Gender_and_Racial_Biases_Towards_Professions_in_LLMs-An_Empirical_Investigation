The biting wind whipped through the gaps in the crumbling stone walls of the ancient fortress, carrying with it the chilling whisper of centuries past.  Elara Vance, her breath clouding the frigid air, adjusted the worn leather satchel slung across her shoulder.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom, illuminating the intricate carvings that adorned the towering keep.  Today, she was leading her usual Tuesday afternoon tour of the Citadel of Aethelgard, a pilgrimage for tourists and a haunting reminder of forgotten glories for Elara.  The fortress, once a beacon of power, now stood as a testament to the relentless march of time and the fragility of empires.

The setting: The Citadel of Aethelgard, a massive, crumbling fortress perched atop a windswept plateau overlooking the shimmering expanse of the Azure Sea.  Towering walls of grey stone, scarred by time and weathering, embraced a labyrinthine interior, filled with echoing chambers and crumbling passages.  The air within the Citadel held the perpetual chill of a forgotten age, punctuated only by the mournful cry of seagulls circling overhead.  Today, the light was a fragile thing, filtering through the fractured stone to cast long, dancing shadows across the dusty floor.
