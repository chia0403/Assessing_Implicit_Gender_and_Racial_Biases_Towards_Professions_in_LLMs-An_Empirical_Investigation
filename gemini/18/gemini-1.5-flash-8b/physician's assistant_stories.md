The fluorescent hum of the emergency room was a constant, low thrumming against Dr. Amelia Hayes's ears.  Sheâ€™d been on her feet since 6 AM, navigating the chaotic dance of broken bones, gasping breaths, and the ever-present scent of antiseptic and fear.  Each patient, a tiny, fragile vessel holding a world of stories, a world she was now temporarily entrusted to navigate.  The worn, beige linoleum beneath her sneakers felt strangely like a battlefield carpet.  This particular evening felt heavier than usual.

The setting:  Mercy General Hospital, a sprawling institution in the heart of a city that never truly slept.  Late October in the Northeastern US brought with it a crisp chill that seeped into the sterile air-conditioned corridors, contrasting with the fiery urgency of the ER.  The city outside, a swirling tapestry of streetlights and shadowy buildings, pulsed with a rhythm Amelia understood all too well.  It was a rhythm dictated by pain, by sudden illness, by the unpredictable and often tragic turns life could take.  She, Amelia Hayes, physician's assistant, was a silent conductor, attempting to guide these fractured harmonies towards healing.
