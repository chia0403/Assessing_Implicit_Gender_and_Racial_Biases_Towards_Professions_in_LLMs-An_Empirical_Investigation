The fluorescent lights of the "Precision Drafting Department" hummed, a monotonous counterpoint to the rhythmic click-clack of Amelia Blackwood's drafting pen against the tracing paper.  Dust motes danced in the pale, sterile light, mirroring the swirling thoughts in Amelia's head.  Her workspace, a small, windowless cubicle, was a testament to the quiet efficiency of the company: a sterile white desk, a stack of blueprints taller than her, and a half-eaten granola bar nestled beside a chipped mug.  Outside, the grey cityscape of Zenith sprawled beneath a perpetually overcast sky, a backdrop as muted as the life Amelia led.

Amelia, a meticulous drafting worker for Zenith Industries, had dedicated the last eight years to translating architects' visions into tangible lines and precise measurements.  She'd drawn countless skyscrapers, meticulously crafted bridges, and intricate underground networks, her hand a faithful instrument of human ambition. Yet, the constant drone of the blueprints, the unrelenting precision demanded by her job, had left her feeling increasingly detached from the very city she helped shape. Today, a particularly complex architectural design for a new orbital observation tower, a project she had poured over for weeks, felt as alien as any other.
