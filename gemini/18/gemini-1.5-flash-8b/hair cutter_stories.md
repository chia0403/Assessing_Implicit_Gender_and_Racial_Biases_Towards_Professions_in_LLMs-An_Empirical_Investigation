The chipped porcelain sink, stained a dull, faded rose, reflected the harsh fluorescent light of "Scissors & Smiles," casting long, skeletal shadows across Amelia Nightingale's cramped workspace.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight piercing the grime-coated window, illuminating the tangled mess of discarded bobby pins and stray strands of dyed hair that littered the counter.  Amelia, a woman of thirty-two with eyes the colour of faded amethyst and hands surprisingly delicate despite the constant tug and snip of shears, meticulously trimmed a wisp of unruly auburn.  Her worn apron, a faded floral print, was speckled with stray highlights â€“ a testament to the rainbow of colours that had graced her clientele over the past decade.  Scissors & Smiles wasn't exactly a salon; it was more a cramped, cluttered haven nestled in the heart of a bustling, forgotten corner of the city, a haven Amelia had meticulously crafted from the remnants of a fading neighbourhood.
