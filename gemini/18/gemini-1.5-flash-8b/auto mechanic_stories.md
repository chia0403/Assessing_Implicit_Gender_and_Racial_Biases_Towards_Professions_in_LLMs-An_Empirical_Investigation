The greasy air hung thick and cloying in the workshop, a symphony of clanking metal and the acrid smell of burnt oil.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grime-coated windows of "Gears & Grime," a tiny auto repair shop tucked away on a side street in the heart of the Rustbelt.  This was the domain of Bartholomew "Barty"  Fitzwilliam, a man who understood the language of engines as readily as he understood the grumbling complaints of his regulars.  Barty, forty-something with calloused hands and eyes that held the weary wisdom of a thousand dismantled carburetors, was hunched over a mangled Ford pickup truck, his brow furrowed in concentration.  The truck, a rusted testament to a lifetime of hauling gravel and questionable maintenance, was sprawled on a lift, its engine a grotesque collection of broken parts.  The rhythmic whirring of the shop's old air compressor was the only sound that could compete with the frantic thump-thump-thump of Barty's heart as he tried to decipher the fault.
