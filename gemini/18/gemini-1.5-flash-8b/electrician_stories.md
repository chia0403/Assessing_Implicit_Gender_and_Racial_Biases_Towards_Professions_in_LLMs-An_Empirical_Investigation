His calloused hands, stained with a surprising array of colours from burnt copper to vibrant emerald green, moved with practiced precision as he wrestled with a stubborn conduit.  He muttered under his breath, a mix of frustration and technical jargon, while the faint hum of the city outside seemed to vibrate against his very bones.  Rain hammered against the corrugated metal roof, mimicking the frantic rhythm of his thoughts.  Elias was a master electrician, though today, even his mastery felt inadequate.
