Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the St. Jude's Hospice, a rhythmic counterpoint to the labored breaths of the patients within.  The air, thick with the scent of antiseptic and lilies, hung heavy in the humid evening.  It was 7:17 PM, and Elara Nightingale, RN, adjusted the oxygen mask on Amelia Dubois' face.

Elara, her uniform damp with sweat despite the air conditioning's feeble efforts, felt the familiar knot of responsibility tighten in her chest.  She had been Amelia's nurse for the past three months, witnessing the slow, agonizing dance of life and death.  The flickering fluorescent lights cast long, dancing shadows across the room, highlighting the intricate network of tubes and wires that sustained Amelia's existence. Outside, the storm raged, mirroring the tempest within Elara.
