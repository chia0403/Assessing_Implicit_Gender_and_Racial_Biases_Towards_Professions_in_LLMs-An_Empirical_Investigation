The fluorescent lights of the rehabilitation center hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia Blackwood's day.  Dust motes danced in the pale light, reflecting in the polished chrome of the exercise equipment.  Amelia, a physical therapist with sharp, observant eyes and a perpetually tired smile, adjusted the tension on a patient's ankle weights.  The rhythmic click of the machine was almost a lullaby, but tonight, the quiet was punctuated by a tremor.  Not in the air, but in the steady pulse of her own heart.


The center, a sprawling two-story building on the outskirts of the city, was a testament to beige and sterile efficiency.  Rows of identical beige cubicles, each smelling faintly of antiseptic and old gym socks, housed the various therapies.  The sleek, modern layout was comforting in its predictability, a stark contrast to the chaos Amelia felt brewing inside.  Outside, a skeletal oak tree cast long, gnarled shadows across the parking lot.  A cold wind whipped through the bare branches, echoing the chill in Amelia's gut. The recent rain had left the pavement slick, a dangerous reminder of the fragility of both the physical and emotional landscape.
