The fluorescent lights of the Salt Lake City airport hummed, a counterpoint to the rhythmic thrum of the approaching jumbo jet.  Amelia Grace Blackwood, a flight attendant with eyes the color of stormy seas and a smile that could melt glaciers, stood at the gate, meticulously arranging a stack of complimentary amenity kits.  Each tiny, meticulously designed pouch held a miniature bottle of hand cream, a pair of noise-canceling headphones, and a small, printed welcome note.  Her uniform, a crisp navy blue, felt oddly constricting, almost suffocating, against the vastness of the terminal.  Outside, the towering peaks of the Wasatch Range, painted in shades of bruised purple and fading rose, cast long shadows across the tarmac. This was her routine: the meticulous prep work, the quiet anticipation, the endless loop of flights. Tonight, however, it felt different. A knot of unease, tighter than the safety instructions pamphlet in her pocket, tightened in her stomach.


The setting:  Salt Lake City International Airport, late afternoon.  The stark contrast between the man-made structures and the stunning backdrop of the Wasatch Mountains adds a layer of both beauty and tension to the scene. The focus is on Amelia, a flight attendant meticulously preparing for her next flight, but there's a subtle sense of dread that hints at a deeper story unfolding.
