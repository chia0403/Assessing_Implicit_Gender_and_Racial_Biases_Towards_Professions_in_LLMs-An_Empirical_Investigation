The biting wind, a relentless sculptor itself, whipped across the desolate plateau, stinging Elias Thorne's exposed cheeks.  He huddled deeper into his worn leather jerkin, the rough texture a familiar comfort against the chill.  The sun, a pale disc sinking towards the jagged peaks that ringed the valley, cast long, skeletal shadows across the desolate landscape.  Above, a hawk, its silhouette sharp against the fading light, wheeled silently, a watchful guardian of this unforgiving terrain.  Elias, his calloused hands gripping the chipped handle of his chisel, was lost in the task before him: coaxing a perfect, almost ethereal, form from a block of grey granite.  His small, secluded workshop, a humble cave carved into the side of the mountain, was bathed in the soft, copper glow of the setting sun. Dust motes danced in the faint light, illuminating the intricate patterns etched into the stone.  The air, thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, held the whisper of ancient legends, stories told in the very stone itself.
