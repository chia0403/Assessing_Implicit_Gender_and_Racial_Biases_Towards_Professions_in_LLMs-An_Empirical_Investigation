The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Back in Action" chiropractic clinic hummed, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *click-clack* of Dr. Alistair Finch's shoes on the linoleum floor.  He adjusted the strap of his canvas tote bag, the weight familiar and comforting.  Outside, the grey London sky threatened rain, mirroring the persistent ache in the lower back of the man slumped in the waiting room chair.  Alistair sighed, a sound barely audible above the whirring of the ventilation system.  Another day, another patient.  Another set of stories whispered in the quiet room, stories laced with pain and frustration, stories that, in a way, Alistair understood better than most.

The clinic, tucked away on a side street in the bustling Camden district, was a haven of muted colours and earthy scents.  Sunlight, meagre even at midday, struggled to penetrate the dense fog of brick and soot clinging to the worn facade. Inside, warm pine panelled walls, a faint herbal aroma from the essential oil diffuser, and a collection of framed anatomical charts filled the space.  Alistair's signature, a discreetly-inked graphic of a spine restored to its natural alignment, hung above the front desk. This was his sanctuary, his battlefield, where he sought to restore harmony to bodies and, sometimes, to lives.
