Dr. Eleanor Vance, a clinical psychologist with a penchant for tweed jackets and even more profound silences, stared out the rain-streaked window of her office.  The relentless drizzle mirrored the swirling anxieties in her mind.  Her small, cluttered office, nestled in the quiet backstreets of Bloomsbury, London, held more than just overflowing file cabinets and the faint scent of old books.  It held the echoes of countless whispered confessions, the fractured fragments of fractured lives.  Today, however, the silence was unusually heavy, punctuated only by the rhythmic drip, drip, drip of the water cascading down the windowpane.  Across the room, a single, unlit lamp cast long, dancing shadows on the worn Persian rug, mimicking the erratic patterns of her patient's thoughts.  The air itself felt thick with unspoken fears and unresolved trauma.  Eleanor, despite her years of training, felt a profound sense of unease. This case felt different.  It feltâ€¦ dangerous.
