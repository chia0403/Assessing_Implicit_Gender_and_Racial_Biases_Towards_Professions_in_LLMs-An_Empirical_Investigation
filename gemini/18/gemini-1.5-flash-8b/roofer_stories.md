The relentless midday sun beat down on Bartholomew "Barty" Grimshaw's back, a relentless hammer against the sweat-slicked leather of his worn-out work gloves.  He crouched precariously on the narrow ridge of the cathedral's south spire, the wind a constant, icy whisper against his exposed skin.  Below him, the bustling marketplace of St. Aethelred hummed with the cacophony of a thousand voices â€“ vendors hawking their wares, children giggling, the rhythmic clang of blacksmiths' hammers.  Above him, the pale grey stone of the cathedral, weathered and stained by centuries of rain and wind, seemed to swallow the sun whole, leaving only a faint, ethereal glow on the intricate carvings of the spire's apex.  This, Barty thought, was his office.  His sanctuary.  And today, his quarry.

**Setting:** St. Aethelred, a medieval-inspired, bustling town nestled in the foothills of the whispering mountains, its streets paved with cobblestones and its buildings made of aged stone, many with intricate carvings.  The cathedral, a towering monument of faith and artistry, dominates the skyline, its spire reaching towards a perpetually overcast sky. The marketplace, with its vibrant atmosphere and the constant buzz of activity, is a living testament to the town's rich culture.
