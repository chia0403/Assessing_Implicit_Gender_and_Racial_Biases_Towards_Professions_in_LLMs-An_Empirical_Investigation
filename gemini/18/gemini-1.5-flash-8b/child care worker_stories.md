The fluorescent lights of the "Little Explorers" daycare hummed, a constant, unsettling drone that vibrated through Amelia Josephine Finchâ€™s bones.  Dust motes danced in the pale, sterile light, mirroring the chaotic energy swirling around her.  Toddlers, a riot of colours and untamed energy, were scattered across the brightly coloured play mats, a kaleidoscope of tiny screams and squeals.  Wooden blocks flew through the air, paint splattered across canvases, and tiny hands, sticky and covered in glitter, clung to the frayed edges of her worn cardigan.  Amelia, a child care worker in her second year, was perpetually caught in a tug-of-war between the demands of her job and the exhaustion threatening to swallow her whole.

The daycare, nestled between a bustling bakery and a perpetually overflowing secondhand store, felt like a small, contained jungle.  The air, thick with the scent of baby powder and half-eaten snacks, hung heavy and humid in the late-afternoon sun.  Sunlight, fractured by the grime-coated windows, cast long, distorted shadows across the playroom.  A faded poster of jungle animals, ripped at the edges, dominated the wall opposite the kitchen.  The aroma of burnt toast, a familiar lunchtime disaster, clung to the air, punctuated by the occasional piercing cry of a child who had encountered something particularly frustrating.  Amelia knew, with the instinctive certainty only a seasoned child care worker could possess, that this particular afternoon was going to be long.
