The biting November wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's coat around her legs as she stepped onto the gravel path leading to the Blackwood Manor aviary.  Dust devils danced across the cracked earth, swirling the fallen leaves into a swirling brown vortex.  Frozen, icy tendrils snaked across the branches of the ancient oaks that framed the path, their skeletal limbs reaching like grasping claws.  The air, thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, carried the faint, almost imperceptible, chirping of unseen birds, a fragile counterpoint to the harsh symphony of the elements.  Amelia, her breath clouding in the frigid air, adjusted her wool scarf, pulling it tighter around her face.  She was the Animal Caretaker, a title she held with a mix of pride and quiet sorrow for the estate's dwindling population.  Blackwood Manor, once teeming with exotic creatures from every corner of the globe, now felt eerily empty.  Her gloves, worn leather cracked in places, barely protected her hands as she approached the imposing, wrought iron gates that marked the entrance to the aviary.  Within, a dozen or more birds of varying plumage and song awaited her.  The fate of each one, the fragile health of every feather, rested on her care.  Her name, whispered on the wind, carried the weight of the manor's history.
