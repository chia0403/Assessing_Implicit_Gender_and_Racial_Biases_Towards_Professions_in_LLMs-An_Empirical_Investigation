The flickering fluorescent lights of Dr. Anya Petrova's dental office hummed, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *tap-tap-tap* of her instruments against enamel.  A faint scent of antiseptic and old coffee hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint, metallic tang of fear.  Outside, the relentless drizzle of a November afternoon hammered against the windowpanes, mirroring the insistent drumming in Anya’s temples.  The chipped paint on the walls, a faded avocado green, seemed to absorb the grey gloom outside, making the already cramped space feel even smaller.

Anya, a woman with eyes that held the steely glint of a seasoned warrior and a mouth perpetually set in a thin line of concentration, adjusted the headlamp.  Her name, etched onto the polished brass plaque above her door – a small, almost insignificant detail in the overall decay of the place – was all that remained of any former grandeur.  This was her tenth year in the same small, rundown office in the heart of the decaying industrial district, a district where the ghost of prosperity lingered, like the faintest echo.  Each patient, each chipped tooth, each whispered plea for relief – all felt like a tiny, repetitive task in a never-ending, grey cycle.
