But beneath the carefully constructed facade of flawless perfection, Anya sensed a tremor, a subtle discordant note in the symphony of Eleanor’s composure. This was a feeling Anya knew well, a recurring theme woven into the tapestry of her work – the silent whispers of unspoken anxieties that clung to every strand of hair, every sculpted eyebrow, every carefully applied shade of lipstick.  Today, however, the whispers felt unusually loud.  The scent of expensive perfume, usually a comforting blanket, seemed almost suffocating.  And the faint, metallic tang of unshed tears hung heavy in the air.
