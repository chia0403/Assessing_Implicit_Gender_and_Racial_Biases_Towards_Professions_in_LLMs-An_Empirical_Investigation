The biting wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vanceâ€™s lab coat around her legs, stinging her exposed cheeks.  The neon sign of the "Hope Haven" nursing home, a monument to faded grandeur, flickered weakly in the gathering dusk, casting long, skeletal shadows across the snow-covered parking lot.  Eleanor, her breath clouding in the frigid air, pulled her knit cap tighter.  A familiar, sharp pang of dread, colder than the air itself, coiled in her stomach.  Another call. Another life hanging by a thread, and this one, she suspected, was particularly fragile.  The radio crackled, the dispatcher's voice a strained whisper through the static.

**Setting:** A small, snow-laden town outside of a major city, in the Northeastern United States.  The Hope Haven nursing home, once a prestigious facility, now shows its age in the peeling paint and worn-out landscaping.  The surrounding area is sparsely populated, the few houses nestled deep within the quiet woods.  The overall impression is one of isolation and vulnerability, heightened by the frigid weather.
