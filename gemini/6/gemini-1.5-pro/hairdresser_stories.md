The aroma of coconut oil and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a peculiar but not unpleasant perfume that clung to everything in Clementine "Clem" O'Malley's salon, "Curl Up & Dye." Located on the cusp of Ashworth-by-the-Sea, a seaside town clinging precariously to the rugged Cornish coast, the salon was a riot of colour.  Flamboyant fuchsia walls clashed joyfully with lime green chairs, while strings of fairy lights twinkled around a chipped porcelain sink. Outside, the November wind howled, whipping rain against the large bay window, but inside, Clem's haven was warm and bustling.  Rain or shine, the women (and occasional brave man) of Ashworth relied on Clem for everything from a quick trim to a complete transformation.  Today, however, the buzz had a nervous edge, a palpable tension that crackled alongside the static from Clem's hairdryer.  Something was brewing in Ashworth-by-the-Sea, something more turbulent than the storm raging outside.
