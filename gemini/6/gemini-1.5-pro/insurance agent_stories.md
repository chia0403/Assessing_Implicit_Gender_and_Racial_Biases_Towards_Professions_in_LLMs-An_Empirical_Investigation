The chipped porcelain flamingo, perched precariously on Mrs. Henderson's mailbox, seemed to leer at Alistair Finch as he trudged up the cracked concrete walkway.  The late afternoon sun, a molten orange orb dipping towards the horizon, cast long, distorted shadows across the manicured, yet undeniably wilting, lawns of Willow Creek. This cul-de-sac, a bastion of mock-Tudor houses and aspirational SUVs, was Alistair's bread and butter, his kingdom of coverage and claims. He adjusted his tie, the Windsor knot clinging stubbornly to the damp patch of sweat blooming beneath his collar.  A bead of perspiration trickled down his temple, a testament to the oppressive July humidity clinging to the air like a damp blanket. Alistair sighed, the weight of another rejected life insurance policy heavy on his shoulders. Mrs. Henderson, notorious for her penny-pinching and distrust of anything remotely resembling financial planning, was proving to be a particularly tough nut to crack.  He smoothed down his thinning, sandy hair, plastered on a smile that felt brittle as the flamingo's beak, and rang the doorbell. The chime, a tinny rendition of "Camptown Races," echoed through the stillness.
