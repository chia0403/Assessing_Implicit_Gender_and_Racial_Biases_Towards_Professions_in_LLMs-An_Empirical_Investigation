The salt-laced wind whipped Amelia Iris Thorne's auburn braid across her face as she surveyed the scene before her.  Perched precariously on a folding stool at the edge of the crumbling cliff face, her paint box balanced on the uneven ground beside her, she was a splash of vibrant colour against the muted greys and greens of the Irish coastline.  The sky, a bruised purple swirling with charcoal clouds, promised rain, but Amelia was undeterred.  Below her, the Atlantic roared against the jagged teeth of the rocks, sending plumes of white spray skyward.  The air was thick with the cries of gulls and the pungent aroma of seaweed.  A dilapidated lighthouse, its white paint peeling like sunburnt skin, clung stubbornly to a distant islet, a solitary sentinel against the vast, restless ocean.  This wild, untamed beauty, this raw power of nature, was what Amelia had travelled halfway across the world to capture.  This was the inspiration for her next masterpiece.
