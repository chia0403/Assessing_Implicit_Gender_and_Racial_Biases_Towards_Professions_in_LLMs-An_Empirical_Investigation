The biting November wind whipped at Amelia Grace Hawthorne's ankles as she hurried across the deserted parking lot of St. Jude's Memorial Hospital.  The fluorescent lights of the Emergency Room entrance glowed sickly yellow against the pre-dawn sky, the only splashes of colour in a landscape of grey concrete and skeletal trees.  Frost crunched under her sensible, leather-soled shoes, a sharp counterpoint to the rhythmic beeping of her pager clipped to her hip.  It was 5:45 a.m., fifteen minutes before the official start of her shift, but Amelia knew better than to expect a quiet transition.  St. Jude's ER, nestled in the heart of the bustling, often chaotic, port city of Baltimore, rarely slept.  Tonight – or, more accurately, this morning – felt particularly ominous, the stillness punctuated by the distant wail of a siren, a harbinger of the storm Amelia sensed brewing within the hospital walls.
