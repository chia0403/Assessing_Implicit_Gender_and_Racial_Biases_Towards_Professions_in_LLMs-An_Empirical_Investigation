The rusty aroma of brake fluid and the whine of a distant grinder hung heavy in the air of O'Malley's Auto Repair.  Sunlight, filtered through the grimy windows of the garage, cast long fingers across the concrete floor, illuminating dust motes dancing in the perpetual oily haze.  Eleanor Vance "Ellie" O'Malley, grease smudged on her cheek and a wrench tucked behind her ear, lay sprawled halfway under a cherry-red 1967 Mustang Fastback, its engine compartment a bewildering tangle of hoses and wires.  The radio, perched precariously on a stack of old tires, blasted a classic rock anthem, seemingly oblivious to the quiet tension radiating from Ellie as she wrestled with a particularly stubborn bolt.  Tucked away on a backstreet of Port Blossom, Maine, O'Malley's was more than just a garage; it was Ellie's sanctuary, her legacy, and her biggest headache all rolled into one.  The salt air from the nearby harbor constantly threatened to rust her tools, the tourists in the summer brought in more clunkers than classics, and yet, Ellie wouldn't trade it for the world. This morning, however, the world was conspiring against her, and that stubborn bolt was just the beginning.
