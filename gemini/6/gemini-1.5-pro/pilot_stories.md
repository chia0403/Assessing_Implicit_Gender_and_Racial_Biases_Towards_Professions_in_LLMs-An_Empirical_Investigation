The biting wind whipped at Amelia "Mia" Reyes's flight jacket as she surveyed the desolate landscape. Jagged peaks, dusted with a fresh coat of snow, clawed at the iron-grey sky above the Alaskan wilderness.  Below, the frozen expanse of Lake Minchumina glittered like a shattered mirror, reflecting the pale, late afternoon sun.  Her Cessna 206, affectionately nicknamed "The Wanderer," sat patiently on the makeshift ice runway, its skis sunk slightly into the packed snow.  Mia exhaled, a puff of white vapour dissipating instantly into the frigid air. This was her life now: ferrying supplies to remote outposts, braving the unpredictable Alaskan weather, and navigating the solitude of the vast, unforgiving wilderness. This particular run, however, felt different.  A prickle of unease danced across her skin, a feeling she couldn't quite shake off, a premonition of something lurking just beyond the horizon of the snow-laden pines.
