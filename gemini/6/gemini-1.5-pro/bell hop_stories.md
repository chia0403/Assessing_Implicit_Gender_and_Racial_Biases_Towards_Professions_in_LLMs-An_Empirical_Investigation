The revolving doors of the Grand Majestic Hotel whispered a sigh of cool air as they spun, offering a brief respite from the sweltering Charleston summer.  Inside, the lobby gleamed, a cathedral of polished marble and shimmering chandeliers.  Sunlight, filtered through stained-glass depictions of palmetto trees and jasmine blossoms, cast kaleidoscopic patterns across the Persian rugs.  Here, amidst the hushed elegance and the faint scent of gardenias, Silas Finch, the youngest and most eager of the Grand Majestic's bellhops, straightened his pillbox hat and waited for the next wave of weary travelers, his brass buttons catching the light like tiny suns.  He knew the routine: a welcoming smile, a swift retrieval of luggage, and a smooth delivery to one of the hotel's lavish suites. But on this particular Tuesday, July 12th, 1927, Silas had a feeling that the routine was about to be spectacularly broken.
