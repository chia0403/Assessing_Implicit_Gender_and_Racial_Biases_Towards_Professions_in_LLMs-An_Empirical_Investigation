The rain hammered against the leaded panes of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office window, each drop a tiny, insistent percussionist in the symphony of a November storm.  Her office, nestled on the second floor of a converted brownstone on Beacon Hill in Boston, usually felt warm and inviting, a sanctuary of muted greens and blues, strategically placed potted ferns, and the comforting scent of old books and vanilla-infused air freshener. Today, however, the gloom outside seemed to have seeped in, clinging to the heavy oak furniture and swirling in the shadows of the late afternoon.  Eleanor, her dark hair pulled back in a loose knot, tapped a pen against her notepad, the rhythmic clicking a counterpoint to the rain's relentless drumming. She was waiting for her final patient of the day, a new referral shrouded in the vague yet ominous label of "complex trauma." The antique clock on the mantelpiece chimed five times, its resonant tones swallowed by the storm's roar.  Just as Eleanor began to wonder if the patient had been deterred by the weather, a hesitant knock echoed from the hallway.
