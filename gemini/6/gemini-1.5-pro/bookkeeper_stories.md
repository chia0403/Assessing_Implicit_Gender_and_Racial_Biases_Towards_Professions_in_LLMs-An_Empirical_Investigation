The frosted glass of Amelia Prudence Higgins’ office door rattled faintly with every passing lorry, a rhythmic counterpoint to the click-clack of her adding machine.  Outside, the November rain lashed against the brick walls of Grimshaw & Sons Import-Export, a dreary, two-story building nestled amongst the warehouses and shipyards of Liverpool’s docklands.

Ledgers lined the shelves, their spines cracked and faded, each a testament to years of meticulously recorded transactions.

She was, after all, nothing if not precise. Every penny accounted for, every debit balanced against a credit.  This was her world, a world of order and numbers, a world that, until today, had offered very few surprises.
