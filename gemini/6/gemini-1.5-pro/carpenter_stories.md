The rasping shriek of the saw echoed through the half-built timber frame house, a lonely sound in the pre-dawn chill.  Dew clung to the scaffolding, soaking the hem of Elijah Blackwood's worn canvas trousers.  He breathed out, a plume of white against the gathering grey of the sky, and surveyed his work. The small cottage, nestled on the windswept cliff overlooking the churning grey expanse of the North Sea, was almost finished.  Salt spray, carried on the ever-present wind, stung Elijah's face and tasted familiarly of home.  This isolated stretch of the Yorkshire coastline, with its jagged cliffs and brooding moors, was all he'd ever known.  And this cottage, built with his own two hands from wood salvaged from a shipwreck, was to be his sanctuary.
