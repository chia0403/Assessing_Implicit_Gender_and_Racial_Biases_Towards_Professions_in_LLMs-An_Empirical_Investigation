The rain hammered against the oversized windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's dental practice, blurring the already fading light of the late November afternoon.  His "Coastal Smiles" office, perched precariously on the edge of the Oregon cliffs overlooking the churning Pacific, usually boasted breathtaking views.  Today, however, the vista was a swirling grey canvas punctuated by the ghostly whitecaps of crashing waves.  Inside, the only illumination came from the warm, halogen glow of the examination room where Elias, his back aching from a long day of fillings and extractions, meticulously sterilized his instruments. The rhythmic hiss of the autoclave was a constant, almost hypnotic drone in the otherwise silent office.  He could hear the wind howling outside, a mournful sound that seemed to seep into the very bones of the building, echoing the growing unease in his own heart.
