The bell above the door of "Nailed It!" tinkled merrily, a sound usually welcomed by Elara Valentina Reyes.  Today, however, the cheerful chime grated on her nerves like nails on a chalkboard.  Outside, the Miami sun beat down on Ocean Drive, baking the Art Deco buildings in a shimmering haze. Inside, the salon hummed with the low thrum of hair dryers, the snip-snip of scissors, and the rhythmic buffing of nail files.  Elara, perched on her rolling stool behind station number three, forced a smile as Mrs. Henderson, a regular known for her demanding nature and penchant for gossip, lowered herself into the plush pedicure chair. Elara's own hands, usually a testament to her meticulous artistry, trembled slightly as she reached for the acetone.  This Tuesday felt different, heavier. The humid air, thick with the scent of acrylic and hairspray, seemed to press down on her, suffocating the usual joy she found in her work. Something was brewing, Elara could feel it in the pit of her stomach, a premonition as sharp and unsettling as a hangnail.
