The relentless wail of the siren sliced through the thick, humid New Orleans air, bouncing off the wrought-iron balconies and echoing down the narrow streets of the French Quarter.  Rain, the kind that comes down in sheets and turns everything slick and shimmering, hammered against the windshield of Medic One. Inside, Amelia “Mia” Catherine Moreau, her dark hair plastered to her forehead, gripped the steering wheel, her knuckles white.  Her partner,  a mountain of a man named Leo “Big Easy” Dubois,  was already prepping the jump bag, his usual jovial demeanor replaced by a focused intensity. The dispatcher’s voice crackled over the radio, "...22-year-old male, GSW to the abdomen, Bourbon Street, outside Lafitte’s Blacksmith Shop. Police on scene, reporting hostile crowd..."  Mia swallowed hard. Bourbon Street on a Saturday night, rain, a gunshot wound, and a hostile crowd.  It was shaping up to be just another night in the Big Easy.
