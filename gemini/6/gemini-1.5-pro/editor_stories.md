Rain lashed against the gothic windows of the Chronicle building, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Amelia Thorne.  The flickering gaslights cast long shadows across her cluttered office, illuminating stacks of manuscripts, overflowing ashtrays, and a half-eaten sandwich clinging precariously to a chipped china plate.

The deadline for the October issue of "The Greyhaven Chronicle" loomed, and she was still desperately searching for a story compelling enough to grace the front page.  The usual fare – local gossip, cryptic pronouncements from the town's eccentric mayor, and reports of strange lights over the moor – simply wouldn't do.  This month, Amelia needed something… extraordinary.
