The flickering fluorescent lights of the Zenith BioTech laboratories hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Elias Thorne's solitary night. Outside, the Chicago wind howled, rattling the paned windows of the imposing skyscraper, but inside, the air was still and sterile, smelling faintly of bleach and something indefinably…metallic.  Elias, his name tag slightly askew on his faded blue uniform, pushed his mop bucket across the polished concrete floor of Lab 42.  It was his least favourite lab to clean.  Not because it was particularly dirty –  the scientists here were meticulous to a fault –  but because of the unsettling silence. No bubbling beakers, no whirring centrifuges. Just rows of stainless steel refrigerators, their contents a chilling mystery behind frosted glass doors. Tonight, the silence was even heavier than usual, broken only by the squeak of Elias's aging mop and the gnawing unease in his gut.
