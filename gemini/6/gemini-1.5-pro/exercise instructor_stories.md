The humid Miami air hung heavy, even at 6:00 am. Dew clung to the vibrant hibiscus blossoms lining the perimeter of Lummus Park, and the rising sun painted the Art Deco buildings along Ocean Drive in shades of coral and gold.  A portable speaker blasted a high-energy Latin remix as  Isabella "Izzy" Rodriguez, clad in neon pink leggings and a matching sports bra, bounced on the balls of her feet. Her dark ponytail swayed with each movement, a counterpoint to the steady rhythm of the music. Twenty-five expectant faces, a kaleidoscope of ages and fitness levels, mirrored her enthusiasm, ready for Izzy's signature "Sunrise Sweat" boot camp.  The ocean breeze, a welcome respite from the growing heat, carried the faint scent of salt and sunscreen, promising another scorching South Florida day.  But for this dedicated group, the burn of their muscles and the endorphin rush were all that mattered in this moment, their sanctuary carved out of the awakening city.
