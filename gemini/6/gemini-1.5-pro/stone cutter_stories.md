The wind, sharp and smelling of pine resin, whipped around Elias Thorne's ears as he chipped away at the rough granite block.  Dust, the color of bone, billowed around him, clinging to the damp wool of his coat.  Greyhaven, nestled high in the Dragon's Tooth Mountains, was a town built on and from the stone itself.  Houses carved directly into the mountainside huddled together like wary sheep, their windows dark, glittering eyes watching the ever-present snow that dusted the peaks even in mid-spring.  Eliasâ€™s workshop, little more than a canvas awning stretched between two ancient pines, perched precariously on a ledge overlooking the valley.  From this vantage point, he could see the winding ribbon of the Silverstream River far below, a sliver of restless mercury reflecting the overcast sky. Today, however, his attention was fixed on the granite, the rough shape of an angel slowly emerging from its heart.  This wasn't just any commission; this was for the new chapel, a project that held the hopes and whispered prayers of all Greyhaven.
