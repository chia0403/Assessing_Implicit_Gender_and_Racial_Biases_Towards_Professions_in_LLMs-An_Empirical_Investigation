He adjusted the thick wool of his gloves and spat a stream of brown tobacco juice onto the frozen earth, the sound sharp and brittle in the pre-dawn stillness.  Silas, a man built like an oak, with hands gnarled and thick as driftwood, surveyed the towering giant he was about to fell.  It was a behemoth, easily twice the girth of any other tree in the immediate vicinity, its ancient bark scarred with the stories of centuries. This one would keep the mill running for a while.  A flicker of something akin to respect, perhaps even reverence, crossed Silas's weathered face, before he reached for his chainsaw, the metallic glint of its teeth catching the weak, nascent light.
