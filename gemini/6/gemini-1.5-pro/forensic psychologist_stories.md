Rain lashed against the arched windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's office, mimicking the relentless drumming in his head.  The gothic spires of St. Jude's Psychiatric Hospital, perched on a windswept bluff overlooking the churning grey expanse of the North Sea, seemed to lean into the gale, like a hunched, watchful gargoyle.  Inside, the air crackled with a nervous energy Elias couldn't quite place. It wasn't the usual low hum of contained anxieties that permeated the aged walls; this was something sharper, more immediate. Heâ€™d been summoned back from a rare weekend leave by a frantic call from the hospital director, the urgency in Dr. Albright's voice suggesting something far more disturbing than a typical episode of patient unrest. Elias, still damp from the downpour, shrugged off his coat, the heavy scent of salt and rain clinging to the wool.  His office, usually a sanctuary of calm amidst the hospital's controlled chaos, felt charged, the silence thick with anticipation.
