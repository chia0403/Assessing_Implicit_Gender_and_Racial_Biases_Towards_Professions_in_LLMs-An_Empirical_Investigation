The biting November wind whistled through the skeletal branches of the elm trees lining Sycamore Street, rattling the frosted panes of Mrs. Periwinkle's bay window.  Inside, a rhythmic *drip...drip...drip* echoed through the otherwise silent Victorian house, a metronome counting down to an inevitable burst pipe.  This was Bartholomew "Barty" Flanagan's cue.  Barty, clad in his signature faded overalls and a woolen hat pulled low over his ears, hopped out of his battered Ford Transit van, its side emblazoned with "Flanagan's Fix-Its: No Drip Too Small."  His breath plumed in the frigid air as he surveyed the house, a looming three-story structure with gingerbread trim and an air of quiet desperation, much like most of his clients.  The town of Hollow Creek, nestled deep in the Pennsylvania mountains, was a place where old houses whispered secrets and plumbing problems were a perennial plague.  This, Barty knew, was going to be an interesting one.
