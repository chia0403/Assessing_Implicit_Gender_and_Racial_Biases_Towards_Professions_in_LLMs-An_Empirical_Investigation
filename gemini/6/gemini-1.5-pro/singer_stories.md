The flickering gaslight painted Amelia Rose Hawthorne's face in a dramatic chiaroscuro as she stood backstage, the scent of dust and stale beer thick in the air.  The Alhambra Music Hall, a once-grand theatre now clinging precariously to its faded glory, hummed with the restless murmur of a Friday night crowd.  Built in the heart of 1890s New Orleans, the Alhambra had seen better days.  Cracks spiderwebbed across the ornate plasterwork, and the velvet curtains, once a rich crimson, were now threadbare and stained the colour of dried blood.  Amelia smoothed down the emerald green silk of her gown, a hand-me-down from her grandmother that shimmered under the weak light. Tonight was her chance, her debut, the opportunity to finally escape the smoky confines of back alley saloons and step into the spotlight she craved.  The frayed rope of the curtain felt rough beneath her trembling fingers. Beyond it lay the promise of a new life, or the crushing weight of failure.  The band struck up a hesitant intro, a single trumpet crying out into the expectant hush.  This was it.
