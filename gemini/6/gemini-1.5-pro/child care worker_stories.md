The fluorescent lights of the "Rainbow Rascals" daycare hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack Amelia Grace Hawthorne had grown accustomed to over her three years of wrangling toddlers.  Rain lashed against the large windows overlooking the small, fenced-in playground, turning the usually bright plastic toys into blurred, primary-colored shapes. Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of stale apple juice, disinfectant, and the faint, lingering aroma of naptime peanut butter sandwiches. Amelia, her auburn hair pulled back in a messy bun, knelt amongst a flurry of building blocks, attempting to mediate a heated dispute between four-year-old Leo, who insisted his tower was taller, and equally stubborn Maya, who vehemently disagreed. Outside, a sudden crack of thunder echoed through the room, silencing the usual cacophony of chattering children and bringing a momentary, uneasy stillness.  It was a Tuesday, just like any other Tuesday at Rainbow Rascals, or so Amelia thought.
