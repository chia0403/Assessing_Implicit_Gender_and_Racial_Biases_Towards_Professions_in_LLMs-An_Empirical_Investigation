The pre-dawn chill clung to the air in Hollow Creek, Virginia, a town where the mist seemed to rise not from the river but from the secrets buried deep beneath the foundations of its colonial houses.  Amelia Rose Hawthorne, a phlebotomist with a steady hand and an even steadier gaze, squinted at the dilapidated Victorian looming before her, its paint peeling like sunburnt skin.  5:47 AM.  Too early for anyone decent to be awake, except perhaps Amelia and the residents of Blackwood Manor, Hollow Creek’s assisted living facility, where the veins, like the building itself, were a little harder to access with each passing year.  Amelia’s breath puffed out in white clouds as she hefted her phlebotomy kit, the clinking of vials a fragile counterpoint to the eerie silence of the sleeping town.  This morning, however, a new kind of stillness permeated the air, a hushed expectancy that prickled the fine hairs on Amelia’s arms.  Something wasn't right.
