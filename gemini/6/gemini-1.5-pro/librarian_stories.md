The perpetually overcast sky above the small town of Hollow Creek seemed to press down on the Agnes Pruitt County Library like a damp, grey blanket.  Rain lashed against the tall, arched windows, mimicking the frantic drumming of Amelia Iris Thorne's fingers against the worn oak circulation desk.  It was a Tuesday afternoon in late October, the kind of afternoon tailor-made for curling up with a good book and a steaming mug of tea, yet Amelia found herself utterly alone. Not a single patron had darkened the library’s door all day. The only sound besides the rain and Amelia’s restless tapping was the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner, each tick a stark reminder of the dwindling hours before closing time and the encroaching darkness that clung to Hollow Creek like a second skin.  The air in the library, usually thick with the comforting scent of old paper and leather, was heavy with a strange, almost metallic tang that Amelia couldn’t quite place.  It prickled her nostrils and made the fine hairs on the back of her neck stand on end.
