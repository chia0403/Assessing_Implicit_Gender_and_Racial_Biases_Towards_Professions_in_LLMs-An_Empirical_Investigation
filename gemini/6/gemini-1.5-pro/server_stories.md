The chipped ceramic mug warmed Amelia "Amy" Reyes's hands as she leaned against the peeling paint of the back door of the Salty Siren Diner.  The pre-dawn Atlantic air, thick with the promise of another scorching Florida day, did little to penetrate the mug's heat or the haze of exhaustion clinging to her.  The Salty Siren, perched precariously on stilts over the choppy waters of the Matanzas Inlet, swayed gently with the rhythm of the tide.  It wasn't much to look at – a faded turquoise shack with a perpetually flickering neon sign shaped like a buxom mermaid – but it was Amy's second home, and the only place in St. Augustine she could afford to call her own.  Inside, the fryers hissed to life, a greasy prelude to the breakfast rush that would soon flood the small diner with tourists and locals alike, hungry for Mrs. O'Malley's famous crab cake Benedict and Amy's bottomless coffee.  The rising sun painted the sky in hues of bruised peach and lavender, reflecting off the scattered fishing boats returning to the harbor with their morning catch. The day, like the tide, was coming in, and Amy knew it would bring with it a fresh wave of challenges and small, salty victories.
