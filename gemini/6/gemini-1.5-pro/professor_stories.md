The biting November wind whipped around Professor Elias Thorne as he hurried across the cobbled quadrangle of St. Jude's College, Oxford.  Gargoyles leered down from the honey-coloured stone of the medieval buildings, their expressions mirroring the frown etched on Elias's face.  Dead leaves, the colour of rust and old gold, swirled around his ankles. The low, grey sky threatened snow.  It was barely 4 pm, but the light was already fading, casting long, skeletal shadows across the manicured lawns and casting the ancient college in an atmosphere of deepening gloom. Elias clutched his worn leather satchel tighter, the unpublished manuscript within a heavy weight against his ribs.  Tonight was the meeting of the Diderot Society, a clandestine gathering of academics devoted to the study of the esoteric and the forbidden, and Elias had something to share, something that had the potential to shatter the foundations of their understanding, and perhaps, his own sanity.
