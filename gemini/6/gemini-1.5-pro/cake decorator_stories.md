The humid Charleston air hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine and impending rain.  Inside "Sugar Magnolia's,"  Eloise Beauregard meticulously piped a delicate buttercream rose onto a three-tiered wedding cake. The bakery, a converted carriage house tucked away on a cobblestone lane, buzzed with the low hum of the refrigerator and the rhythmic whir of an electric mixer. Sunlight, fractured by the stained glass panels flanking the front door, splashed across the worn wooden floorboards, illuminating swirling motes of powdered sugar that danced in the air like miniature, glittering ghosts. Eloise, her brow furrowed in concentration, adjusted the rose's position with a practiced flick of her wrist.  This wasn't just any wedding cake; it was for the daughter of Charleston's mayor, and Eloise, known for her exquisite sugar artistry, had poured every ounce of her talent into its creation.  Little did she know, this cake was about to become much more than a centerpiece; it was about to become the center of a scandal that would shake the foundations of Charleston society.
