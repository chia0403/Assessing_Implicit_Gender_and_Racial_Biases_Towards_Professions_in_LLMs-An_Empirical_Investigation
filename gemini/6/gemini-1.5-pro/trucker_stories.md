The neon glow of the Desert Rose Diner smeared across the rain-slicked asphalt, casting an oily rainbow that ended abruptly at the worn tires of Delilah "Dee" Jones's eighteen-wheeler.  Dee, her full name Delilah Mae Jones, cut the engine of her rig, the sudden silence amplified by the drumming of the rain on the cab's metal roof.  Mesquite, Nevada, population 1,492 (not counting the tumbleweeds, Dee often joked), blinked a sleepy welcome through the downpour. The diner, a beacon of warmth and greasy spoons in the vast, empty expanse of the Mojave Desert, was the only sign of life for miles in either direction along the desolate stretch of Highway 93.  Inside, Dee knew, sheâ€™d find lukewarm coffee, soggy fries, and the same tired playlist of country heartbreak songs.  But tonight, even that predictable monotony was a welcome change from the howling wind and the whispering emptiness of the open road.
