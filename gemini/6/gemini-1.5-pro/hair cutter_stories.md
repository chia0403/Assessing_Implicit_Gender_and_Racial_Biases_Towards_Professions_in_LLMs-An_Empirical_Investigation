The rusty bell above the door of "Shear Perfection" jangled a discordant welcome as Elias Thorne, his hands stained faintly purple from the latest batch of elderflower hair dye, looked up from sharpening his scissors.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun that slanted through the large, single-paned window, illuminating the faded glamour of the small salon. Elias’s shop sat nestled between a boarded-up bakery and a perpetually flickering neon sign advertising psychic readings in the sleepy, almost forgotten town of Harmony Creek, Oregon.  Harmony Creek, a name that felt increasingly ironic given the town’s dwindling population and the general air of quiet desperation that clung to the cracked sidewalks and peeling paint. Elias, however, found a peculiar comfort in the stillness. It allowed him to focus on the precise, meticulous art of cutting hair, an art he considered a sacred ritual. Today, however, the stillness was broken. The bell jangled again, and a shadow fell across the threshold, promising a disruption to Elias's carefully curated quiet.
