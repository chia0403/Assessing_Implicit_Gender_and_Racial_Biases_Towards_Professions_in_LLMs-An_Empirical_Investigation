The biting wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vance's auburn braid across her face as she wrestled the barn door open.  The hinges protested with a mournful screech that echoed across the desolate expanse of the Wyoming high plains.

Eleanor stamped her feet, trying to restore feeling to her toes inside her insulated boots. Inside the barn, the air was thick with the scent of hay and the anxious lowing of cattle huddled together for warmth.  Tonight, Eleanor wasn't here for a routine check-up. A call from a frantic Mr. Callahan had summoned her to the ranch, his voice tight with worry over a newborn calf struggling to survive the early winter chill.
