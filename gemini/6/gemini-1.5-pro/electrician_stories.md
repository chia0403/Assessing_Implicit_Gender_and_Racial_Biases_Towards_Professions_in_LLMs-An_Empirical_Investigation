The biting wind whipped off the Puget Sound, stinging Amelia “Amy” Reyes’s cheeks as she wrestled with a frozen padlock on the gate to the Bainbridge Island ferry terminal.  It was 3:17 am, the sky a bruised purple bleeding into the inky black of a late November morning. Sodium vapor lamps cast a sickly yellow glow over the deserted loading area, their light reflecting off the slick concrete.  Amy, bundled in a thick Carhartt jacket and beanie, grunted with exertion, her breath clouding in the frigid air.  She’d gotten the call just an hour ago – a critical power outage threatening to shut down the entire terminal during the morning rush.  No pressure. This wasn't exactly rewiring a kitchen; thousands of commuters relied on this place running smoothly.  The padlock finally succumbed with a metallic shriek, and Amy pushed the gate open, the rusty hinges groaning in protest. Beyond lay the sprawling terminal building, a hulking shadow against the pre-dawn gloom, silent and still, except for the ominous flicker of emergency lights in the distance.
