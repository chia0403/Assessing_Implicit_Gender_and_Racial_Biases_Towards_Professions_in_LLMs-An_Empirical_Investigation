The opulent lobby of the Hotel Magnifique shimmered. Sunlight, fractured by the enormous crystal chandelier, danced across the polished marble floor, illuminating flecks of gold embedded within.  The air, conditioned to a perfect 72 degrees, hummed with the low murmur of hushed conversations and the gentle clinking of fine china from the adjacent tea room.  Behind the gleaming mahogany concierge desk,  Isabelle "Izzy" Beaumont adjusted the silk scarf at her neck, a practiced smile gracing her lips.  Outside, the Parisian rain hammered against the grand arched windows, a dramatic counterpoint to the serene elegance within. Izzy, a veteran of the Magnifique's demanding clientele for over a decade, could anticipate their every whim, from securing front-row seats at the opera to finding the perfect shade of blush rose for a last-minute anniversary bouquet. This evening, however, promised something different. A chill, unrelated to the Parisian weather, prickled at the back of her neck as a figure emerged from the swirling grey mist beyond the revolving doors.
