The fluorescent lights of Northwood High hummed a monotonous B-flat, a soundtrack to Eleanor Vance’s Tuesday morning.  Rain lashed against the window of her small, cluttered office, turning the playing fields outside into a blurry green and grey watercolour.  Diplomas from the University of Oregon and Portland State hung slightly askew on the wall, flanking a framed poster of a kitten clinging precariously to a branch captioned “Hang in there!”  Eleanor, her dark hair pulled back in a practical bun, sifted through a stack of college applications, the scent of stale coffee and something vaguely floral hanging in the air.  This was her domain, a sanctuary of sorts amidst the swirling chaos of teenage angst and ambition that was Northwood High in the perpetually damp autumn of the Pacific Northwest. This year, however, the chaos felt…different. A palpable tension simmered beneath the surface of everyday school life, a tension Eleanor couldn’t quite put her finger on, but one that made the usual pre-graduation jitters feel almost ominous.
