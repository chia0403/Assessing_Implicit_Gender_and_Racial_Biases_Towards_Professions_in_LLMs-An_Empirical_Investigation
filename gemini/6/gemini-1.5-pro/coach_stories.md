The biting November wind whipped across the deserted bleachers of Harmon Field, carrying the scent of decaying leaves and the faint, lingering ghost of chlorine from the recently closed community pool.  Floodlights cast long, skeletal shadows from the goalposts, painting the muddy pitch in a harsh, unforgiving light. Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez, head coach of the struggling Northwood High Wildcats, pulled her worn fleece tighter around her as she watched the groundskeeper, old Mr. Henderson, methodically roll up the sidelines.  Northwood, a small town nestled in the foothills of the Appalachians, lived and breathed high school football, and tonightâ€™s devastating loss to their cross-town rivals, the Mill Creek Eagles, had cast a pall over the entire community.  Amy knew that this season, more than any other, rested squarely on her shoulders, a weight that felt heavier with each gust of wind.  She had promised the town, the team, and most importantly, herself, that she would bring Northwood back to its former glory.  But with only two games left in the season and a team riddled with injuries and self-doubt,  that promise felt dangerously close to breaking.
