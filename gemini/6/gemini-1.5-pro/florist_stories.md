The bell above the door of "Petal & Plume" jingled merrily, a counterpoint to the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of Eliza Jane Worthington’s shears.  Outside, the Charleston, South Carolina air hung thick and heavy with the perfume of jasmine and impending rain. Inside, the tiny shop, crammed with buckets overflowing with hydrangeas, roses, lilies, and more exotic blooms, hummed with a quieter, greener fragrance. Eliza Jane, her auburn braid falling over one shoulder like a silken rope, surveyed her handiwork: a cascading bouquet of blush pink peonies and ivory sweet peas, destined for a bride who, according to her frantic mother,  was currently threatening to elope to Vegas with a banjo player.  Eliza Jane sighed, a single freckle on her nose wrinkling.  Weddings were always a mixed bouquet of joy and high-strung anxiety.  This one, however, seemed particularly…fragrant with impending disaster.
