Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Silas Finch's office, a relentless percussion accompanying the mournful saxophone solo crackling from the ancient radio perched on his desk. The office, nestled above a laundromat on Bleecker Street in Manhattan, smelled of stale coffee, damp wool, and a faint, lingering aroma of Mrs. Rodriguez's empanadas from the bakery next door.  Silas Thatcher Finch, a man whose rumpled trench coat seemed permanently attached to his frame, swiveled in his worn leather chair, the squeak a familiar counterpoint to the city's symphony of sirens and honking taxis.  The flickering neon sign advertising "Finch Investigations - Discretion Guaranteed" cast long, skeletal shadows across the room, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air like tiny, restless ghosts.  It was a Wednesday night in November, the kind that burrowed deep into your bones and settled there, refusing to leave until spring.  The phone, a bulky rotary model that had seen better days, jangled, its insistent ring slicing through the melancholic music.
