The mahogany desk, polished to a mirror sheen, reflected the flickering gaslight back into Judge Elias Thorne’s weary eyes. Rain lashed against the tall windows of his chambers, a relentless drumming that mirrored the tension coiling in his gut.

He pushed aside the stack of case files, each one a testament to the city’s woes – petty theft, industrial sabotage, and the ever-present shadow of organized crime that clung to Coburg like the smog that choked its chimneys.  Tonight, however, felt different.  Tonight, the silence spoke of something far more unsettling.
