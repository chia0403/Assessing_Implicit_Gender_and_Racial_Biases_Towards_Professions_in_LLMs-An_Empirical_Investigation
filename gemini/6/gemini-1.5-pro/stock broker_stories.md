Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Elias Thorne's thirty-second-floor office, blurring the already fading twilight view of Manhattan.  The Chrysler Building, usually a majestic spire piercing the sky, was tonight a ghostly silhouette swallowed by the storm. Elias, his tie loosened and his bespoke suit slightly rumpled after a fourteen-hour workday, swiveled away from the cityscape. His office, a testament to both success and carefully curated taste, was dominated by dark wood furniture, rich leather upholstery, and a disconcertingly large digital ticker tape displaying the relentless fluctuations of the Dow Jones.  A half-eaten container of sushi sat precariously on the edge of his mahogany desk, a testament to a dinner sacrificed at the altar of a volatile market.  Tonight, it was the tech sector, specifically the freefall of a promising AI startup, that had kept Elias chained to his Bloomberg terminal. The rhythmic tap-tap-tap of his fingers on the keyboard was the only sound besides the relentless drumming of the rain, a soundtrack to the mounting pressure he felt building in his chest.  He had a lot riding on this, more than most people knew.
