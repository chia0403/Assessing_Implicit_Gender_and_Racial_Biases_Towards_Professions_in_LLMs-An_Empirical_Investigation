The biting wind whipped at Elias Thorne's thick wool coat as he trudged across the frozen ground, his breath clouding the air in front of him. Dawn was barely breaking over the sprawling expanse of the Whisperwind Wildlife Sanctuary, painting the snow-dusted peaks of the Dragon's Tooth Mountains a delicate shade of rose.  Elias, his weathered face etched with lines of both concern and compassion, carried a bucket filled with warm goat's milk, its steam a fleeting defiance against the pervasive chill. The Sanctuary, nestled within a secluded valley in the northernmost reaches of Vermont, was home to a collection of orphaned and injured animals, each with its own story of survival, and each relying on Elias's unwavering dedication. Today, his most pressing concern was a young snow leopard cub, barely a month old, struggling to adapt to the harsh winter after losing its mother to a rockslide.  The cub, whom Elias had named Whisper, was housed in a specially constructed enclosure within the main barn, a haven of warmth amidst the frozen landscape.  The faint, mewling cry of the cub, barely audible over the wind's howl, urged Elias forward, quickening his pace.
