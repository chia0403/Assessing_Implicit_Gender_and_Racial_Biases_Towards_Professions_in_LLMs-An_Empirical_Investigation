The flickering fluorescent lights of the server room hummed a monotonous C sharp, a soundtrack to Amelia Reyesâ€™s mounting frustration.  It was 3:17 AM on a Tuesday, the air thick with the metallic tang of overworked electronics, and Amelia, a Senior Systems Analyst for Chronos Incorporated, was staring into the abyss of a blinking cursor. Chronos Tower, a gleaming obsidian monolith piercing the perpetually overcast Seattle sky, was supposed to be a beacon of technological advancement.  Tonight, however, it felt more like a tomb, its polished granite floors reflecting the pale, exhausted face of its sole occupant.  The entire network, responsible for synchronizing global financial transactions, was grinding to a halt, and Amelia, armed with only lukewarm coffee and a rapidly dwindling supply of patience, was the only one standing between Chronos and utter chaos.  Outside, the first whispers of dawn were painting the eastern sky a bruised purple, a stark contrast to the sterile white of the server room.  The rhythmic clicking of Amelia's keyboard echoed in the cavernous space, a lonely counterpoint to the ominous whirring of the failing server.  Something was deeply wrong, something beyond a simple glitch or overloaded processor, and Amelia had a gnawing suspicion that it was far more sinister than a faulty cable.
