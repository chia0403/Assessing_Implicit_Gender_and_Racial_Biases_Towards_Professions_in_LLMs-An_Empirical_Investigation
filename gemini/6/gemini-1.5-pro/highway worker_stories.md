The asphalt shimmered under the brutal July sun, radiating a heat that buckled the air itself.  Dust devils danced across the cracked surface of Highway 17, kicking up grit that stung the eyes of Elias Vance.  He squinted, the sweat stinging as it trickled down the weathered lines etched into his face. His bright orange vest, damp with perspiration, clung to him like a second skin.  Elias adjusted his hard hat, the brim shadowing his deep-set brown eyes, and surveyed the stretch of road ahead. The shimmering horizon, broken only by the distant, hazy silhouette of the San Gabriel Mountains, offered no respite from the oppressive California heat.  Today's task was patching potholes, a Sisyphean labor Elias had performed countless times in his twenty years with Caltrans.  The rhythmic thump of jackhammers echoed in the distance, punctuated by the rumble of eighteen-wheelers barreling past, each one a blast of wind and diesel fumes that momentarily broke the stifling stillness.  This desolate stretch of highway, miles from the nearest town, was Elias's domain, his office, his purgatory.  He knew every dip, every crack, every faded white line like the back of his hand.  He also knew that today, something felt different. The air, thick with heat and the scent of creosote, hung with an unnatural stillness, a pregnant silence that hinted at something brewing on the horizon.
