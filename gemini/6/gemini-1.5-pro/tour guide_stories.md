The salt spray kissed Amelia "Mia" Rodriguez's face as she leaned against the railing of the *Mermaid's Kiss*, a battered but beloved ferry boat chugging its way across the turquoise waters of the Bay of All Souls. The bay, a horseshoe-shaped cradle nestled between the volcanic slopes of Isla Paradiso and the vibrant coral reefs that fringed the coastline, shimmered under the late afternoon sun.  Isla Paradiso itself, a riot of bougainvillea-draped balconies, terracotta rooftops, and the occasional glimpse of a centuries-old church spire, rose like a mirage from the water.  Mia adjusted the brim of her wide-brimmed hat, a necessary shield against the relentless Caribbean sun, and surveyed her small group of tourists. Five eager faces, all varying shades of sunburn, stared back at her with a mixture of awe and anticipation. This was Mia's bread and butter - showing off the hidden gems of her island home, weaving tales of pirates, lost treasures, and the magic that supposedly still clung to the ancient stones of Isla Paradiso. Today's adventure: a guided hike through the whispering forests to the secluded Cascada de Sirenas, the Waterfall of Sirens, rumored to grant wishes to those who dared to bathe in its mystical waters.
