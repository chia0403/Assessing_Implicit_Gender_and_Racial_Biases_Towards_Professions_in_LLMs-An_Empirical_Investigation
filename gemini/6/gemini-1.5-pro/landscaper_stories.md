The biting wind whipped at Amelia Reyesâ€™s cheeks, turning them a rosy pink that clashed spectacularly with her mud-caked overalls.  October in the Catskills was a fickle beast, one minute offering the golden warmth of Indian summer, the next spitting sleet and threatening an early blizzard. This morning, it seemed firmly entrenched in its icy mood. Amelia pulled her knit cap further down over her ears, tucking a stray strand of dark hair back under its warmth. Around her, the once vibrant gardens of the Hemlock House Estate lay dormant, skeletal branches reaching towards the steely grey sky. Fallen leaves, the color of burnt umber and ochre, swirled around her ankles like miniature dervishes. The Hemlock House itself loomed large behind her, a three-story Victorian mansion with gables and turrets that seemed to pierce the low-hanging clouds. It was a magnificent, if somewhat imposing, structure, its grey stone facade giving it the air of a slumbering giant.  This grand estate, perched on a hill overlooking the Hudson River valley, was Amelia's current project, and she was determined to prepare its grounds for the harsh winter ahead, even if the weather had other plans.
