The flickering fluorescent lights of Darrow & Sons Architectural Firm buzzed like trapped insects, a soundtrack Amelia Reyes had grown accustomed to over the past five years.  The air hung thick with the scent of blueprint ink and stale coffee, a comforting, if slightly nauseating, aroma that permeated everything in the aging, two-story brick building on Elm Street. Outside, the Chicago wind howled a mournful tune against the frosted January windows, but inside, the only sound was the rhythmic scratch of Ameliaâ€™s pencil against vellum paper as she meticulously rendered the details of a new condominium complex. Each precise line, each carefully measured angle, represented hours of work, a testament to her dedication and skill.  She loved the feeling of bringing a building to life on paper, watching a chaotic jumble of measurements and sketches transform into a tangible, if two-dimensional, reality.  But today, a knot of unease tightened in her stomach, a feeling she couldn't quite shake, even as she immersed herself in the intricate details of the building's facade. Something felt off, and it wasn't just the flickering lights.
