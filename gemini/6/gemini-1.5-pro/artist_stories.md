The salt spray kissed Amelia Reyes's face, the fine mist clinging to her eyelashes like tiny diamonds.  The late afternoon sun, a bruised apricot sinking towards the jagged teeth of the Cornish coastline, cast long shadows across Porthleven harbour.  Fishing boats, bobbing gently on the turquoise water, clanged against each other, their masts a skeletal forest against the darkening sky. Amelia, perched on a weathered stone wall, her sketchbook open on her lap, chewed the end of her charcoal pencil, her gaze fixed on the rhythmic dance of the waves.  The air, thick with the smell of brine and woodsmoke from the nearby pub, filled her lungs, a stark contrast to the sterile scent of turpentine that usually permeated her London studio. This tiny, windswept village, clinging precariously to the granite cliffs, was a world away from the clamorous city, and for Amelia, it was a sanctuary, a place where inspiration whispered on the wind.
