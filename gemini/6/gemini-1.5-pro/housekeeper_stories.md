The biting November wind whipped around Agnes Prunella Featherbottom's ankles as she wrestled the heavy oak door of Eventide Manor closed.  The latch clicked with a satisfying thunk, a small victory against the encroaching gloom of the late afternoon.  Eventide, perched on a windswept bluff overlooking the churning grey expanse of the North Sea, was a magnificent, if somewhat daunting, edifice.  Gargoyles leered from its parapets, their stone faces slick with rain, and ivy, thick as a manâ€™s arm, clawed at the weathered stone walls.  Inside, shadows stretched long fingers across the cavernous rooms, hinting at secrets hidden within the aged tapestries and behind the portraits of stern-faced ancestors.  Agnes, however, felt no fear.  She had been housekeeper at Eventide for twenty years, and knew its creaks and groans as intimately as her own reflection.  This grand, lonely house was her domain, and within its walls, she was queen.  Or, at least, she was until the new owner arrived.
