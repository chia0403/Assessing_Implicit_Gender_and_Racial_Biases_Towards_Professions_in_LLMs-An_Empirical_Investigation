Rain lashed against the mullioned windows of Dr. Elias Thorneâ€™s office, mimicking the tempest brewing inside his newest patient.  The room, usually a sanctuary of warm earth tones and strategically placed greenery, felt claustrophobic under the oppressive grey light of the late November afternoon.  Outside, the wind howled through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks lining Sycamore Street in the quaint, historic town of Havenwood, Massachusetts.  Inside, a young woman with eyes the color of storm clouds clutched a tissue, her knuckles white against the worn fabric.  Dr. Thorne, his brow furrowed with concern, waited patiently, the silence punctuated only by the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner and the muffled sobs emanating from the figure huddled in the plush armchair across from him.  He had a feeling this session, and perhaps many more to come, would delve into the darkest corners of Havenwood, a town whose idyllic facade concealed secrets as deep and chilling as the approaching winter.
