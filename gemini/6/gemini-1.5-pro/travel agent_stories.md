The insistent chirping of a gecko, hidden somewhere amidst the overflowing hibiscus blossoms outside her window, was the soundtrack to Amelia "Amy" Reyes's Tuesday morning.  Damp heat, thick and fragrant with plumeria, clung to the air in her tiny office, a converted storage room tacked onto the back of the Aloha ʻĀina Realty building in Hilo, Hawai'i.  A faded map of the world, crisscrossed with pins and tangled strings of yarn connecting dream destinations, papered one wall.  Brochures showcasing turquoise waters and white sand beaches threatened to spill off a wobbly bamboo shelf.  Amy, clad in a bright yellow sundress and flip-flops despite the downpour lashing against the corrugated iron roof, tapped a manicured nail against her keyboard, the glow of the screen illuminating her frustrated frown.  For a travel agent specializing in exotic getaways, her own world felt increasingly…small.
