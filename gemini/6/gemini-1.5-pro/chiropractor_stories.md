The neon "Open" sign in Dr. Elias Thorne's window buzzed faintly, a counterpoint to the rhythmic swoosh of the cars on rain-slicked Ashworth Avenue.  Inside, the waiting room of Thorne Chiropractic and Wellness was a haven from the November chill.  Warm ochre walls held framed anatomical charts and inspirational posters featuring impossibly flexible yogis.  A faint scent of sandalwood battled the lingering chlorine smell clinging to Elias's clothes from his pre-work swim.  Heâ€™d just finished toweling off his thick, dark hair when the bell above the door chimed, announcing his first patient of the day. Elias pasted on a welcoming smile, hoping it reached his eyes, which felt perpetually gritty after a late night reviewing x-rays. Ashworth, a once-thriving mill town nestled in the foothills of the Massachusetts Berkshires, wasn't exactly a hotbed of chiropractic needs, but Elias was determined to make a go of it, even if it meant long hours and the persistent aroma of damp wool clinging to everything.
