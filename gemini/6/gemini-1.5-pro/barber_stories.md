The rusty squeak of the barber chair was as familiar to Elias Finch as his own heartbeat.  His shop, "Finch's Fine Cuts and Shaves," nestled between Mrs. O’Malley’s perpetually fragrant bakery and Mr. Henderson’s dusty antique store, had been a fixture on Elm Street in the sleepy town of Havenwood, Pennsylvania, for over fifty years.  Sunlight, filtered through the large front window, illuminated the swirling dust motes dancing in the air, highlighting the worn leather of the waiting chairs and the gleaming chrome of the sterilized tools neatly arranged on Elias’s counter.  The air, thick with the scent of bay rum and talcum powder, hung heavy with the weight of untold stories, whispered confidences, and the quiet rhythm of small-town life.  It was a Tuesday morning, much like any other in Havenwood, but Elias had a feeling, a prickle at the back of his neck, that today, something was about to change.
