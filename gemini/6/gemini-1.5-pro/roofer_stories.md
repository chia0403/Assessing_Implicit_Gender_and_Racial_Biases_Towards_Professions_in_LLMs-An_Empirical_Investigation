The tar hissed and bubbled under the August sun, clinging to Elias Thorne's trowel like molten licorice.  Heat radiated up from the shingles, baking the air around him until it shimmered. Below, the town of Harmony Creek, Pennsylvania, drowsed in the afternoon haze.  From his vantage point atop Mrs. Gable's Victorian, Elias could see the whole place laid out like a child's diorama: the white steeple of the First Methodist Church, the faded red brick of the general store, the sluggish meander of Harmony Creek itself, glinting silver through the willows.  It was a postcard-perfect scene, but Elias, sweat stinging his eyes and a hammer throbbing against his temple, wasn't in much of a mood to appreciate it.  This was the third roof heâ€™d tackled this week, and the unrelenting heat was starting to wear him down.  He wiped a grimy hand across his forehead, leaving a streak of black tar against his sunburnt skin, and sighed. This small town held more secrets than its idyllic facade let on, and Elias, more than anyone, knew how quickly harmony could turn to discord.
