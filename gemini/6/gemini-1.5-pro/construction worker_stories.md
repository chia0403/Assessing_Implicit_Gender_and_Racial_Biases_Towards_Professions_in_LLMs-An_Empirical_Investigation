The biting November wind whipped across the skeletal frame of the "Aurora," a skyscraper that aspired to kiss the Chicago clouds. Rivets shrieked like tortured birds as they were driven into steel, a deafening chorus against the low rumble of traffic far below.  Elijah Vance Holloway, his breath clouding in the frigid air, tightened the straps of his harness, the rough nylon biting into the thick layers beneath his work jacket.  He adjusted his hard hat, a worn sticker of the Chicago Cubs clinging stubbornly to the side, and spat a stream of brown tobacco juice that arced down towards the dizzying emptiness below.  Thirty-two stories up, the world felt fragile and distant, the grey lake churning like dirty dishwater, the towering buildings of the Magnificent Mile shrunk to the size of toy blocks. Today, Elijah was tasked with securing the eastern section of the scaffolding, a job that required a steady hand, a good head for heights, and a healthy respect for the capricious whims of the Chicago wind. He wasn't thrilled about it.  Not at all.  Something about this building, this specific height, rubbed him the wrong way, prickled a primal fear that he usually kept buried under layers of grit and bravado.
