The flickering fluorescent lights of the Quick Stop buzzed like trapped insects, casting a sickly yellow glow over Aisling O'Malley and the desolate aisles of the convenience store.  It was 3:17 AM in Harmony Creek, a town whose name was a cruel joke considering the discordant snoring of the town drunk slumped against the newspaper rack outside.  Rain lashed against the single window, blurring the already faded image of a smiling cartoon hot dog advertising "Hank's Franks â€“ Taste the Harmony!"  Aisling, her name tag pinned slightly askew on her faded blue uniform, chewed on the end of a blue pen, the ink staining the corner of her lip a vibrant, almost unnatural, shade.  The digital clock above the lottery tickets blinked relentlessly, each second an agonizing tick towards the end of her shift, a shift that felt as endless and repetitive as the chirp of the crickets trapped behind the dusty Gatorade cooler.  Harmony Creek might have been sleeping, but for Aisling, the night had just begun to reveal its secrets.
