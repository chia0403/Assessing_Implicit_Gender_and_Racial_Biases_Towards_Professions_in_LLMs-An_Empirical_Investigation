The biting Antarctic wind whipped at Dr. Evelyn Reed's parka, stinging any exposed skin and making the metal rungs of the observation tower feel like ice against her gloved hands.  Seven thousand feet above sea level, perched precariously on the edge of the Ellsworth Mountains, the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station wasn't just the most southerly research facility on Earth; it was also the most isolated.  For Evelyn, however, isolation was a small price to pay for the pristine, unpolluted air and the unparalleled view of the cosmos it offered.  Tonight, the aurora australis danced a vibrant green and violet ballet across the inky canvas, a breathtaking spectacle that usually filled her with a sense of awe.  Tonight, however, a different kind of electricity hung in the air â€“ a tension that had nothing to do with the solar wind and everything to do with the data logs clutched tightly in her numb fingers.
