The clatter of pots and the sizzle of butter in a cast iron pan were the soundtrack to Tuesday mornings at the Busy Bee Diner.  Grease hung thick in the air, mingling with the sweet perfume of Mrs. Higgins' famous cinnamon rolls and the sharp tang of vinegar from the pickle jar Elias Finch kept perpetually perched on the counter. Elias, whose full name was Elias Samuel Finch, wiped a bead of sweat from his brow with the back of his flour-dusted hand. The Busy Bee wasn't much to look at – a squat brick building nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed antique shop on the outskirts of Harmony Creek, Nevada – but it was Elias's kingdom.  The checkered linoleum floor was worn smooth by generations of hungry locals, the vinyl booths cracked and patched, and the faded movie posters on the wall held the stories of countless forgotten matinees.  But within those walls, Elias spun culinary magic, transforming humble ingredients into dishes that warmed bellies and soothed souls. This morning, however, a disquiet hummed beneath the usual rhythm of the diner, a tension that even the comforting scent of frying bacon couldn't mask.
