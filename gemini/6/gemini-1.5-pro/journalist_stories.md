Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the cluttered desks and overflowing ashtrays. Cincinnati, Ohio, in the sweltering July of 1958, was usually a humid, languid place, but tonight, a cold front had swept in, bringing with it a sense of unease that resonated with Amy's growing suspicion.  She crumpled yet another draft of her article about the sudden closure of the West End's beloved Majestic Theatre, the crumpled ball joining a small mountain on her desk. Something about the official story – dwindling attendance, rising costs – didn't ring true.  The Majestic had been packed every night, buzzing with the vibrant pulse of the city's predominantly Black community.  Amy could still hear the echoes of laughter and music that had spilled out onto the streets, a stark contrast to the ominous silence that now hung heavy in the air.  There was a story here, a bigger one than failing ticket sales, and Amy, despite the gnawing fear in her gut, was determined to find it.
