The relentless Nevada sun beat down on the dusty asphalt of Harmony Springs, a town that clung precariously to the edge of civilization – and possibly sanity.  A tumbleweed, the size of a small dog, bounced lazily past the plate-glass window of Harmony Drug, momentarily obscuring the meticulously arranged display of arthritis creams and sunscreen. Inside, Elias Thorne, PharmD, sighed and adjusted the thin wire frames of his glasses, a gesture he repeated almost unconsciously whenever the weight of his responsibilities pressed down on him.  Harmony Drug was more than just a pharmacy; it was the town's unofficial community center, first aid station, and occasional therapist’s office.  Elias, the sole pharmacist for a hundred miles in any direction, was all too aware of the reliance placed upon him, a burden he carried with both pride and a growing sense of weary resignation.  The bell above the door chimed, announcing a customer, and Elias plastered on his professional smile, bracing himself for whatever ailment, real or imagined, walked through the door. The dry, desert air hung heavy with the scent of sagebrush and something faintly metallic, something that Elias couldn't quite place, but which prickled at the back of his nose and set his teeth subtly on edge.
