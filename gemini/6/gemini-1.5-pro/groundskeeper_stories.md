The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorne, tugging at the brim of his worn tweed cap and sending brittle oak leaves swirling across the manicured lawns of Athelney Manor.  Frost crunched under his heavy boots, the sound strangely amplified in the pre-dawn quiet.  Athelney, a sprawling Victorian gothic nestled deep in the Somerset countryside, was still shrouded in shadow, its many gables and chimneys silhouetted against the bruised purple sky. Elias, head groundskeeper for the past twenty years, preferred these solitary hours before the rest of the household stirred.  It was then that the gardens truly belonged to him, a kingdom of dew-kissed roses, dormant wisteria, and the whispering secrets held within the ancient yew hedges.  This morning, however, a different kind of secret hung in the air, a chill that went deeper than the frost and settled uneasily in the pit of Eliasâ€™s stomach.
