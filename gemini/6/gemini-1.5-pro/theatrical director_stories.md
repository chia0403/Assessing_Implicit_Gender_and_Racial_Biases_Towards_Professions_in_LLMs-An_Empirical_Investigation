The velvet curtains of the dilapidated Grand Majestic Theatre smelled of dust and forgotten dreams, a scent Genevieve "Gen" Dubois knew intimately.  October in Chicago breathed a chill wind that whistled through the cracked windowpanes of her makeshift office, a converted storage closet backstage.  Rain lashed against the brick walls, a mournful symphony echoing the state of Gen's current production of "A Midsummer Night's Dream."  Opening night was a mere week away, and her Puck had just eloped with the wardrobe mistress, leaving a gaping hole in the already precarious fabric of the play.  Gen, clad in paint-splattered overalls and a perpetually frayed scarf, rubbed her temples, a headache brewing behind her tired eyes. The flickering fluorescent light above buzzed in sympathy, casting long, distorted shadows that danced with the dust motes, mocking her predicament.  The Grand Majestic, once a jewel of the Chicago theatre scene, was now a faded relic, much like the play's chances of success, and Gen, ever the optimist, was starting to feel the weight of both their histories pressing down on her.
