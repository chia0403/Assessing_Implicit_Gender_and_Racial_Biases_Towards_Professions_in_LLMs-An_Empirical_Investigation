A prickle of unease, a discordant note in the otherwise flawless symphony of due diligence, resonated within her.  The Jameson CEO, a slick, charming man named Alistair Finch, had been nothing but accommodating, almost too eager to finalize the deal.  And that’s what bothered her.  Amy trusted her gut, and right now, it was screaming at her to tread carefully.  The rhythmic tick-tock of the antique clock on her bookshelf seemed to amplify the tension in the air, each second ticking away towards a decision that could make or break her career.
