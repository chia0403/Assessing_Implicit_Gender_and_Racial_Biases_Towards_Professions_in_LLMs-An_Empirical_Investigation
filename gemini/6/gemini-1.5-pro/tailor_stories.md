The biting wind that whipped down Cobblestone Alley carried the scent of brine and woodsmoke, a familiar aroma to Elias Thorne, proprietor of Thorne & Needle. His shop, nestled between a fishmonger and a notoriously boisterous tavern called The Rusty Mug, was a pocket of warmth and quiet in the bustling port city of Aethelgard.  Sunlight, weak and watery in the late autumn afternoon, filtered through the grimy windowpanes, illuminating the cluttered space.  Rolls of fine silks and sturdy wools lay stacked against one wall, their vibrant colours muted in the dim light.  A half-finished doublet of emerald green velvet draped over a dressmaker's dummy, its intricate embroidery gleaming with gold thread. Elias, a man of precise movements and quiet demeanor, sat hunched over his workbench, the rhythmic click of his needle against a thimble the only sound in the otherwise silent shop.  Outside, the cries of gulls mingled with the shouts of dockworkers, but within Thorne & Needle, a sense of peaceful industry reigned.
