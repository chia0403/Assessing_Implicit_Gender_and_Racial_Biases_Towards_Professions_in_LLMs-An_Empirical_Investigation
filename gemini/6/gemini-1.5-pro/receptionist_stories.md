The flickering fluorescent lights of Dr. Albright's office buzzed in counterpoint to the gentle whir of the ancient air conditioning unit.  Dust motes danced in the pale beams, illuminating the worn floral wallpaper and the slightly crooked "Welcome" sign above Amelia Grace Hawthorne's head.  Amelia, perched behind her faux-wood reception desk, tapped a chipped crimson nail against the dusty surface.  Outside, the humid Charleston air hung heavy, clinging to the Spanish moss draped over the live oaks lining Broad Street.  It was a Tuesday in July, the slowest day of the week, and the only sounds besides the office’s mechanical chorus were the distant chimes of St. Michael's Church and the rhythmic click of Amelia’s pen as she doodled elaborate curlicues on a discarded appointment reminder card.  She was expecting a delivery of new patient files, a welcome distraction from the suffocating stillness.
