Inside, amidst the chaos of drying hair, spilled powders, and the low hum of a vintage hair dryer, Izzy, her own raven hair pulled back in a messy bun, worked with the fierce concentration of a surgeon performing delicate brain surgery.  Tonight, however, the stakes were arguably lower – though the client, a notoriously demanding Broadway actress, was giving her a run for her money.
