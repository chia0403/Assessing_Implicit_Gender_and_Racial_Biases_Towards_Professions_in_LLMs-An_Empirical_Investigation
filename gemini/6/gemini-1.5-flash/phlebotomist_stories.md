The fluorescent lights of the Mercy General Hospital lab hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* of Amelia Grace Hawthorne's own heartbeat.  It wasn't the needles – those were old friends – but the persistent, gnawing feeling in her gut that something was wrong.  The sterile scent of antiseptic couldn't mask the undercurrent of something…off.  Amelia, a phlebotomist with ten years of experience and a talent for spotting the subtle cues of a patient's discomfort beyond the usual pre-needle jitters, felt a prickle of unease that had nothing to do with the impending blood draw.  This morning felt different.  The usual pre-dawn bustle of the lab – the clatter of centrifuges, the hushed conversations of nurses, the quiet efficiency of her colleagues – all seemed… muted, shadowed by an unspoken tension that clung to the air like a persistent cough.
