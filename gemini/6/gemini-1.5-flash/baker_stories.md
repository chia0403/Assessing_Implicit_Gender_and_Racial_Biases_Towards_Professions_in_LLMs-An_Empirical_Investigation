The pre-dawn chill clung to Elias Thorne's flour-dusted apron like a second skin.  He wasn't a man who appreciated the cold, preferring the comforting warmth of his bakery, "The Golden Crust," a haven nestled on the cobbled, rain-slicked streets of Port Blossom.

This morning, however, the contrast was particularly sharp: the crisp, almost painful cold battling the fragrant warmth billowing from The Golden Crust, a beacon of sugared delights in the pre-sunrise gloom.  Inside, the air thrummed with the comforting rhythm of Elias's ancient mixer, a tireless workhorse that had churned out countless loaves and pastries over the years, its metallic heart echoing the steady beat of Elias's own.
