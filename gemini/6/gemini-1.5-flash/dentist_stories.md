The biting wind whipped at Dr. Eleanor Vance’s coat as she hurried across the deserted town square.  Snow, the kind that clung like icy cobwebs, plastered itself to her dark hair and eyelashes, obscuring the already fading twilight.  The only sounds were the rhythmic crunch of her boots on the packed snow and the mournful howl of the wind whistling through the skeletal branches of the ancient oak trees that lined the square.  This wasn't the picturesque postcard version of Havenwood, Vermont; this was Havenwood in the teeth of a January blizzard, a place where even the usually cheerful glow of the town’s Christmas lights felt muted and forlorn.  The biting cold seeped into her very bones, a stark contrast to the warmth she usually found within the sterile, comforting confines of her dental practice, Vance & Vance Family Dentistry, just a few blocks away.  Tonight, however, the warmth of her office felt a million miles distant, and a growing sense of unease settled heavily in her stomach, colder than the blizzard itself.
