The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of frangipani and something faintly…rotten.  Amelia Hernandez, a woman whose smile lines spoke of countless sunrises viewed from breathtaking vantage points, adjusted the brim of her wide-brimmed hat.  Sweat beaded on her forehead, a stark contrast to the meticulously applied makeup she’d used to enhance her already striking features.  She surveyed her tour group – a motley collection of sunburnt tourists clutching water bottles and guidebooks – gathered at the foot of the crumbling Mayan temple, Xibalba’s Breath, lost somewhere in the heart of the Guatemalan jungle.  The air thrummed with the incessant buzz of cicadas, a relentless soundtrack to the ancient stones that seemed to whisper secrets to the whispering wind.  The jungle itself, a vibrant tapestry of emerald green and shadowy purple, felt both welcoming and menacing, its beauty underscored by an underlying sense of unease that Amelia knew all too well.
