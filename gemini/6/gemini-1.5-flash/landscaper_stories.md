The dawn painted the eastern sky in bruised purples and fiery oranges, a spectacle Elias Thorne, owner of Thorne Landscaping, usually appreciated.  But this morning, the breathtaking view was lost on him.  He was hunched over a particularly stubborn patch of Virginia creeper, its tenacious tendrils wrapped around a weathered oak like the grasping fingers of a vengeful spirit.

The manor itself, a Gothic monstrosity of crumbling stone and shadowed eaves, loomed behind him, a silent sentinel guarding its secrets â€“ and Elias was about to unearth one.
