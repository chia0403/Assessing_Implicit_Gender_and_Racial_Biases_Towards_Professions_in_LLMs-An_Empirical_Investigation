The humid Charleston air hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine and the faint, salty tang of the Cooper River.  Cicadas buzzed a relentless soundtrack to the late afternoon, their chirping a counterpoint to the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Amelia “Mia” Davenport’s stilettos on the ancient, moss-draped brick pavement.  Mia, a real estate agent with a reputation for closing deals as smoothly as a Lowcountry sunset, adjusted the silk scarf at her throat, the pale peach fabric a stark contrast to her crisp white linen suit.  She surveyed the antebellum mansion before her, its weathered grandeur hinting at a history both glorious and shadowed.  This wasn't just another property;  Magnolia House, with its decaying elegance and whispered secrets, was a challenge, a siren song calling to her competitive spirit.  The for sale sign, newly erected, seemed to shimmer in the hazy heat, a stark promise of either immense reward or spectacular failure.
