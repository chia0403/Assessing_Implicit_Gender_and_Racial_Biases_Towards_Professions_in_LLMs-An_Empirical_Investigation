The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful song around Captain Elara Vance’s weathered Cessna 185, rattling the single propeller like a skeletal hand shaking a tambourine.  Below, the Chugach Mountains clawed at the bruised twilight sky, their snow-capped peaks jagged teeth against a backdrop of bruised purple and bleeding orange.  Elara, her breath misting in the frigid air, checked her instruments one last time – altimeter, compass, fuel gauge – each a familiar friend in this unforgiving landscape.  The radio crackled with static, a counterpoint to the rhythmic thump of the engine, its steady pulse a lifeline in the vast, silent wilderness.  Tonight's flight was personal, a clandestine mission shrouded in secrecy that gnawed at her conscience even as the adrenaline surged through her veins.  The weight of the cargo – and the promise she'd made – pressed down on her like the mountain's implacable shadow.
