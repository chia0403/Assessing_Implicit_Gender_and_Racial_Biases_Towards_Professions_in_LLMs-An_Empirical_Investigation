The chipped porcelain teacup warmed Amelia Hernandez’s hands, a stark contrast to the icy November rain lashing against the windowpanes of her small, cluttered office.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and damp wool, a fitting aroma for the melancholic Tuesday afternoon unfolding.  Amelia, a woman whose meticulously coiffed auburn bun betrayed a sharp mind and an even sharper wit, sighed, the sound swallowed by the rhythmic drumming of the rain.  Her desk, a chaotic landscape of policy forms, half-eaten candy wrappers, and a rather alarming collection of novelty stress balls, offered little solace.  Outside, the grey expanse of the Cornish coastline, usually a source of calming inspiration, only seemed to emphasize the dreary circumstances of her current predicament:  Mr. Silas Blackwood, a notoriously difficult client and owner of the aptly named Blackwood Manor, was late – again – for their scheduled review of his life insurance policy.  And Amelia, despite her years of experience as an insurance agent for Coastal Assurance, had a sinking feeling this meeting would be anything but routine.
