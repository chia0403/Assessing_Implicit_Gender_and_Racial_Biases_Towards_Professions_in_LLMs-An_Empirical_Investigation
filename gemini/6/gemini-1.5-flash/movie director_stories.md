The pre-dawn chill bit at Isabella “Izzy” Reyes’ exposed skin, the damp Los Angeles air clinging to her like a shroud.  The sprawling, dilapidated mansion perched precariously on a cliff overlooking the Pacific Ocean was less a location scout’s dream and more a crumbling testament to Hollywood’s forgotten grandeur.  Ivy, thick as a python, strangled the crumbling stonework; broken windows stared out like empty sockets.  This was supposed to be the location for the climactic scene of "Serpent's Kiss," Izzy's ambitious, and frankly, terrifying, gothic horror film – a project that had already consumed her for three years, leaving her emotionally and financially drained.  The rising sun cast a sickly yellow glow on the chaotic scene below:  a scattered array of crew members, bleary-eyed and battling the elements, fought to get the set ready before the fickle California light abandoned them completely.  Izzy, wrapped in a threadbare cashmere shawl, sipped lukewarm coffee, her gaze fixed on the skeletal remains of a once magnificent staircase – a perfect metaphor, she thought grimly, for her own career.
