The stale scent of sawdust and forgotten dreams clung to the air in the dilapidated theatre, a perfume only Isolde Blackwood truly appreciated.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single bare bulb hanging precariously above the stage, danced in the twilight filtering through the grimy skylight.  Isolde, her sharp cheekbones accentuated by the gloom, traced a finger along the chipped paint of a crumbling proscenium arch.  The Grand Majestic Theatre, once a jewel of the city, now echoed with the ghosts of forgotten premieres and the quiet rustle of decay.  Its grandeur was a tattered tapestry, threads of magnificence barely clinging to a skeletal frame, mirroring, Isolde thought with a grim smile, the state of her own precarious finances.  Tonight, however, felt different. Tonight, the ghosts weren't whispering of failure; they were murmuring of a chance, a desperate, glorious chance to resurrect them all.
