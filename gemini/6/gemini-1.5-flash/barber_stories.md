The rusty swing sign creaked a mournful tune in the humid Louisiana air, the faded lettering barely visible:  "Bartholomew "Barty" O'Malley, Master Barber."  Barty himself, a man whose face resembled a well-worn leather boot – lined with wrinkles etched by sun, worry, and too many late nights – sat polishing his straight razor with meticulous care.  The tiny barbershop, wedged between a boarded-up pawn shop and a perpetually greasy spoon diner called "The Griddle," felt thick with the scent of Bay Rum and simmering resentment.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of sunlight slicing through the grimy windowpane, illuminating the chipped porcelain sink and the array of antique clippers lining the wall, silent witnesses to decades of hushed conversations and closely guarded secrets in the heart of Bayou Boeuf.
