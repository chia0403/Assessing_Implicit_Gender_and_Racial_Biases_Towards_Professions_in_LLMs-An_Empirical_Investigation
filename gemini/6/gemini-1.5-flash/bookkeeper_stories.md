The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the ledger, highlighting the meticulous script of Amelia Katherine Finch.

The air hung thick with the scent of old paper, dried ink, and a faint, underlying sweetness – perhaps the lingering aroma of the plum cake she’d eaten earlier that afternoon.  Amelia, a woman whose life was as precisely ordered as her accounts, worked in a small, cramped room above a bustling fishmonger's shop on the cobbled streets of Grimsborough, a town perpetually shrouded in a damp, sea-salty mist.  The rhythmic scratch of her quill against the parchment was the only sound competing with the distant cries of gulls and the rhythmic clang of the fishmonger's scales below. Tonight, however, a different sound – a soft, insistent tapping at the door – broke the usual quiet monotony, a discordant note in Amelia’s carefully orchestrated world.
