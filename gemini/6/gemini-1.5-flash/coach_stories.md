The biting November wind whipped across the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks lining the perimeter of Blackwood High’s football field, carrying with it the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves.  A thin layer of frost coated the bleachers, a stark reminder of the dwindling daylight hours and the approaching end of the season.  Amelia “Amy” Hernandez, head coach of the Blackwood Hawks, stood alone, her breath misting in the frigid air, a half-empty thermos of lukewarm coffee clutched in her gloved hand. The field lights cast long, dramatic shadows, stretching and distorting the already forlorn landscape.  The recent defeat against rival Northwood High still stung, a bitter taste lingering on her tongue more potent than any caffeine.  This wasn't just a game; it was a reflection of her own faltering leadership, a stark reminder of the pressure she was under to deliver a winning season.  The silence of the empty field was broken only by the mournful creak of the stadium gates and the distant howl of a lone coyote.  Tonight, the weight of expectation felt heavier than ever.
