The biting November wind whipped across the desolate expanse of Highway 17, tearing at Elias Thorne's already chapped lips.  Elias, a man whose hands were as rough as the cracked asphalt he surveyed, hunched deeper into his worn orange work jacket.  The sky, a bruised purple bleeding into a sickly grey, mirrored the mood of the day.  Rain, a fine, icy drizzle, plastered his dark hair to his forehead, blurring the already indistinct outlines of the towering redwood trees that lined the highway's edge like skeletal sentinels.  The only sound louder than the wind's mournful howl was the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of his heavy boots against the cold, damp pavement.  He was miles from anywhere, the nearest town a distant glimmer of lights swallowed by the encroaching twilight, and the job – patching a particularly nasty pothole near Devil's Elbow – felt as endless as the highway itself.
