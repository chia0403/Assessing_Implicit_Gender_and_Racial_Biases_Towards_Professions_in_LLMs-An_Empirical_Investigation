The biting November wind whipped Elias Thorne's already-chapped lips raw as he wrestled with a stubborn oak branch, its leaves clinging tenaciously despite the encroaching winter. Elias, a man whose life was as weathered and predictable as the ancient grounds he tended, surveyed Blackwood Manor with a sigh.

The manicured lawns, usually a source of quiet pride, were now a sodden, windswept mess, and the skeletal branches of the towering trees clawed at the bruised, twilight sky.  Inside, beyond the imposing wrought-iron gates and the overgrown rhododendrons that threatened to swallow the gravel path whole, lay a world Elias knew only from the distant murmur of voices and the occasional fleeting glimpse of a shadowy figure in a window. A world he was content to remain outside of, his solace found in the quiet companionship of the earth and the whispering secrets of the wind.
