The greasy scent of burnt motor oil clung to Elias Thorne like a second skin.  It mingled with the sharp tang of ozone from a recently repaired alternator and the faint sweetness of spilled cola, a testament to Elias's late-night struggles with a particularly stubborn Ford Pinto.  He wiped his brow, leaving a smear of grime across his forehead, and surveyed his kingdom: Thorne's Tune-Ups, a single-bay garage tucked away on the edge of Dustbowl, Nevada, a town so forgotten it barely registered on most maps.  The desert wind, a relentless sculptor, had carved the surrounding hills into a landscape of rusty reds and bleached bone whites, a fitting backdrop to the collection of rusting cars that littered his yard – silent, sun-baked witnesses to countless repairs and more than a few near-miracles performed by Elias’s capable hands.  The neon sign above the door, flickering intermittently, cast a sickly yellow glow on the cracked asphalt of the driveway.  Tonight, however, even the relentless desert seemed to hold its breath, anticipating the arrival of a customer unlike any Elias had ever seen before.
