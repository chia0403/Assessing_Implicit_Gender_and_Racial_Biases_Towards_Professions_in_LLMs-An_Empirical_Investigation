The brass spittoon gleamed under the sickly yellow light of the Grand Majestic Hotel lobby, reflecting the nervous tremor in Finley "Finn" O'Malley's hands.  Finn, a bellhop whose uniform was as creased as his brow, adjusted the worn leather strap of his luggage cart, the weight of it a familiar burden mirroring the weight on his heart.  Rain lashed against the towering Art Deco windows, blurring the city lights into a hazy, melancholic smear.  The air, thick with the scent of stale cigar smoke and expensive perfume, hummed with a low thrum of suppressed anxiety; a symphony only those who worked the night shift at the Grand Majestic truly understood.  Tonight, however, the usual unease was amplified, thickened with a palpable sense of foreboding that settled in Finn's gut like a lead weight.  Something big was about to happen, he could feel it in the bones of the old building, in the restless energy of the wealthy guests flitting about, their faces etched with a mixture of anticipation and dread.
