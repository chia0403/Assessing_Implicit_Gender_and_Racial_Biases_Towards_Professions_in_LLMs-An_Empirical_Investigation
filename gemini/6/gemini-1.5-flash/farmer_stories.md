The rasp of the rusty ploughshare against the unforgiving clay was a familiar song to Elias Thorne.  His calloused hands, thick as oak roots and stained the colour of dried blood from years spent wrestling with the land, gripped the handles with unwavering resolve.  The sun, a malevolent eye in the bleached sky, beat down on the parched fields of Dustbowl Valley, baking the earth to a brick-like hardness.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of grit and despair, danced across the cracked landscape, mocking Elias’s tireless efforts.  This year, the drought was the worst he’d ever seen, and the whispers of abandonment, once a distant murmur, were now a howling wind in his ears. The only sound louder than the plough was the gnawing hunger in his belly.
