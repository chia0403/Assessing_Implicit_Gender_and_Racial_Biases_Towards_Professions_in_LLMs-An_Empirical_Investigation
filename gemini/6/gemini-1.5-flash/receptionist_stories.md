The fluorescent lights of "Sterling & Steele, Attorneys at Law" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Penelope Anne Featherstonehaugh's otherwise silent existence. Penelope, or Penny as she preferred (though few dared to use it in the presence of Mr. Sterling’s thunderous glare), sat perched on her surprisingly uncomfortable ergonomic chair, the polished mahogany desk a stark contrast to the chipped paint on the windowsill where a wilting peace lily desperately sought sunlight.  Dust motes danced in the single beam slicing through the grimy windowpane, illuminating the chaos of paperwork stacked haphazardly on her desk; a testament to the relentless tidal wave of lawsuits, subpoenas, and general legal mayhem that perpetually threatened to engulf the office.  Outside, the relentless Chicago wind howled a mournful dirge, rattling the windowpanes and mirroring the turmoil simmering beneath Penny’s meticulously applied lipstick. Today, however, the usual hum of legal tension was heightened by a palpable sense of foreboding, something in the air thicker than the recycled office air.
