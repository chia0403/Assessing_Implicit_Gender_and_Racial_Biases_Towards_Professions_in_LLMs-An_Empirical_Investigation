The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful song around Dr. Eleanor Vance’s sturdy parka, whipping snow into frenzied spirals that momentarily obscured the skeletal remains of the abandoned fishing shack.  The air tasted of salt spray and something feral, something…musky.  Eleanor shivered, pulling her fur-lined hood tighter around her face, the icy breath fogging her glasses. The ramshackle structure, perched precariously on a cliff overlooking the churning grey expanse of the Bering Sea, was her destination – or rather, the destination of her patient, a creature whose distress call had crackled over her satellite phone earlier that morning.  The only light came from the weak beam of her headlamp, cutting a fleeting swathe through the blizzard, revealing patches of ice slick as glass underfoot.  This wasn't her usual clientele;  the pampered poodles and neurotic Persian cats of her Anchorage practice felt a world away from this desolate, unforgiving landscape.
