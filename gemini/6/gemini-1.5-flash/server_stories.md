The chipped Formica tabletop felt clammy beneath Elara Vance’s hand as she balanced a precarious tower of three plates – a glistening seafood linguine, a mountain of garlic bread, and a precarious-looking panna cotta threatening to topple at any moment.  The air in "The Salty Siren," a seafood restaurant clinging precariously to the edge of a perpetually stormy Maine coastline, hung thick with the smell of brine, frying butter, and desperation.  The low thrum of the ocean punctuated the clatter of cutlery and the occasional, strained laugh from a table of overly-enthusiastic tourists.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune, whipping rain against the restaurant's panoramic windows, blurring the already-hazy view of the churning grey sea.  Elara, her dark braid whipping across her shoulder with each nervous step, navigated the crowded dining room with the practiced grace of a tightrope walker, praying the panna cotta held its composure until it reached its destination: Table 7, currently occupied by a group of particularly boisterous businessmen whose laughter sounded suspiciously like guffaws.
