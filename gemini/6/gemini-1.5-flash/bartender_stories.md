The chipped Formica bar top felt cool beneath Elias Thorne's fingertips as he polished a already gleaming glass.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows of "The Rusty Mug," blurring the neon glow of the liquor store across the alley into a hazy, pulsating smear.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale beer, spilled whiskey, and something indefinably… feral. It was the kind of smell that clung to the city itself, a miasma of desperation and grit that Elias, a bartender of fifteen years at this particular establishment, had long since grown accustomed to.  Tonight, however, even the familiar stench seemed amplified, laced with a note of something sharper, something like… ozone. The only other sound besides the drumming rain was the low thrum of the refrigerator humming its tireless, lonely tune.
