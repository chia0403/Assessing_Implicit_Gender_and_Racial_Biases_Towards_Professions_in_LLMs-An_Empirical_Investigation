The scent of aged paper and leather, a fragrance both comforting and slightly melancholic, hung heavy in the air of the Blackwood Library. Dust motes, illuminated by the afternoon sun slanting through the tall, arched windows, danced in the stillness.  Eleanor Vance, a woman whose life was as meticulously ordered as the Dewey Decimal System itself, adjusted her spectacles, the faintest click echoing in the hushed reading room.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune against the ancient stone walls, a stark contrast to the serene calm she cultivated within her domain.  The Blackwood Library, with its creaking floorboards and whispered secrets tucked away in countless volumes, was Eleanor’s sanctuary, a fortress against the chaos of the world, but tonight, something felt… different.  A subtle shift in the familiar, a tremor in the quiet rhythm of her life.
