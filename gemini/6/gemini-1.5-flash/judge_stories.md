The air in Judge Evangeline Moreauâ€™s chambers hung thick and heavy, a humid blanket woven from the scent of old leather and impending thunderstorms.  Rain lashed against the tall, arched windows of the historic courthouse, blurring the already indistinct cityscape of New Orleans into a watercolour wash of grey and bruised purple.  Evangeline, her silver-grey hair pulled severely back from a face etched with the weariness of a thousand hard-fought cases, steepled her fingers, the faintest tremor betraying the anxiety simmering beneath her composed exterior.  The storm outside mirrored the one raging within her.  This wasn't just another case; it was personal.  A shadow, long and dark, stretched from the past, threatening to engulf her in its chilling embrace.  The heavy oak door creaked open, revealing a figure silhouetted against the stormy backdrop, and Evangeline knew, with a certainty that chilled her to the bone, that the storm had finally broken.
