The biting Antarctic wind howled a mournful song around Dr. Aris Thorne’s research station, a symphony of ice cracking and groaning that echoed the turmoil in his own chest.  He hunched deeper into his parka, the synthetic fabric offering little solace against the -40°C chill that gnawed at exposed skin.  The Vostok Station, a lonely outpost clinging precariously to the vast, white expanse of the East Antarctic plateau, felt more like a prison than a scientific haven tonight.  The endless, featureless landscape, stretching to the horizon in every direction, pressed in on him, amplifying the isolation that had become his constant companion during the last six months.  The only light came from the station’s harsh, fluorescent bulbs and the ethereal glow of the aurora australis dancing across the inky sky – a breathtaking spectacle that offered little comfort to a man haunted by the secrets buried deep beneath the ice.
