The aroma of vanilla bean and burnt sugar hung thick and sweet in the air, a familiar perfume to Aurelia "Rel" Nightingale.  Rel, a woman whose flour-dusted apron was as much a part of her as her own skin, surveyed her kingdom:  "The Sweet Surrender," a tiny, brightly painted bakery nestled on a cobbled side street in the heart of Prague’s Old Town.  Rain, a persistent drizzle that clung to the ancient stones like a second skin, pattered against the leaded glass windows, blurring the already hazy gaslight glow into shimmering pools of amber.  Inside, however, a warm, inviting chaos reigned.  Half-finished castles of marzipan stood proudly beside precarious towers of buttercream, while a mountain of perfectly formed macarons waited patiently for their final dusting of powdered sugar.  Tonight, Rel wasn't just baking; tonight, she was creating a masterpiece.  A wedding cake, to be precise – one that would hopefully hold up under the weight of a notoriously demanding bride and her even more demanding family.
