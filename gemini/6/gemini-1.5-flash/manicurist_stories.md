The chipped turquoise paint of Serenity Nails peeled away like a sunburnt tan, mirroring the frayed edges of Esmeralda "Esme" Valencia's patience.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single, flickering fluorescent bulb above, danced in the humid air of her tiny, almost claustrophobic salon.  The air hung heavy with the cloying sweetness of lavender polish remover and the faintly acrid scent of stale coffee, a testament to Esme's long day and even longer week. Outside, the relentless Miami sun beat down on the cracked asphalt of Calle Ocho, the vibrant rhythms of salsa music a stark contrast to the quiet desperation that had settled over Esme as she stared at the empty appointment book.  Another slow day in paradise.
