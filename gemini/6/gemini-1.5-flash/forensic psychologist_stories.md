The biting November wind whipped Dr. Evelyn Reed's charcoal-grey coat around her legs as she navigated the uneven cobblestones of the Grimsborough Cemetery.  A skeletal oak, its branches clawing at the bruised twilight sky, cast long, skeletal shadows that danced with the flickering flames of the single lantern she carried.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, a perfume far more pungent than the lilies and chrysanthemums hastily arranged on the freshly turned grave before her.  This wasn't a typical grief-stricken family; the victim, a young woman named Sarah Jenkins, had been found brutally murdered in her own apartment, a scene so meticulously staged it felt less like a crime of passion and more like a macabre work of art.  And it was Evelyn's job, as a forensic psychologist for the Grimsborough Police Department, to decipher the artist's twisted mind.
