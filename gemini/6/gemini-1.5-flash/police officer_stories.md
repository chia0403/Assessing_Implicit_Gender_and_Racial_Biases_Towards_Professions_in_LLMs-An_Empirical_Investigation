The salt spray stung Detective Inspector Ava Thorne's face as the wind howled a mournful dirge across the desolate expanse of Saltfleet Sands.  The sky, a bruised purple bleeding into a sickly yellow at the horizon, mirrored the grimness settling in her gut.

The rhythmic crash of waves against the jagged cliffs was almost a comforting counterpoint to the silence – a silence that held a heavy, unspoken weight, as thick and suffocating as the sea fog clinging to the treacherous coastline.  This wasn't just another missing person's case; the air itself vibrated with a menace she couldn't quite name, a feeling as cold and sharp as the shards of broken glass scattered across the windswept beach where the search began.
