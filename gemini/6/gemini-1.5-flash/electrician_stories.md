The biting November wind howled a mournful tune through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks lining Blackwood Lane, rattling the already precarious windows of Number 13.  Inside, the flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows that mirrored the unease churning in the stomach of Elias Thorne, Master Electrician.  Elias, a man whose hands, calloused and strong from years of wrestling with recalcitrant wiring, usually possessed an unwavering confidence, felt a prickle of unease that went beyond the usual anxieties of a late-night house call.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and something elseâ€¦something metallic and faintly acrid, like burnt copper.  Number 13, a rambling Victorian gothic monstrosity perched precariously on the edge of the Blackwood Forest, was notorious amongst the locals, not for its architectural flaws, but for the strange occurrences that seemed to cling to its decaying timbers like stubborn ivy.
