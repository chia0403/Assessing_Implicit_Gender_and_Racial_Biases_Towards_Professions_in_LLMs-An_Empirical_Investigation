Outside, the Chicago wind howled a mournful ballad against the towering steel and glass skyscrapers, but within the confines of the architectural firm of Peterson & Davies, a relative calm reigned, broken only by the clatter of the occasional blueprint tumbling from an overstuffed filing cabinet.  Elias, hunched over his drafting board, meticulously rendered the intricate details of a proposed high-rise, oblivious to the storm raging beyond the window.  The deadline loomed, a pressure as palpable as the weight of the heavy drafting lamp perched above his head.
