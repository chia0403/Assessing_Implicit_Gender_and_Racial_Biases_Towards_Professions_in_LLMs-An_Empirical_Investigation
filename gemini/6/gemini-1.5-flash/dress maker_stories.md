The scent of lavender and old silk hung heavy in the air, a comforting perfume that clung to the dusty velvet curtains and the worn wooden floors of "Stitches in Time," Aurelia Josephine Beaumont's atelier.  Sunlight, fractured by the leaded panes of the attic window, painted dappled patterns across the bolts of fabric stacked haphazardly against the walls – a riot of color in a space otherwise dominated by muted browns and the quiet hum of Aurelia's ancient Singer sewing machine.  Dust motes danced in the golden beams, each one a tiny, glittering echo of the countless shimmering threads Aurelia had woven into her creations over the years.  Outside, the cobbled streets of the quaint seaside town of Seabrook hummed with the lazy rhythm of a summer afternoon, but inside, Aurelia’s world was a sanctuary of needles, pins, and the whispered promise of a perfectly tailored gown.
