The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Jack Stratton's office, a relentless percussion that mirrored the throbbing headache behind his eyes.  The air hung thick and sour with the smell of stale coffee and desperation – a familiar aroma in his cramped, dimly lit office above a failing bakery on Bleecker Street.  Bleecker Street itself, a narrow artery choked with overflowing bins and the mournful sighs of stray cats, was usually bustling, but tonight, even its usual chaotic energy was dampened by the downpour.  Jack, a man whose trench coat was perpetually damp and whose face bore the roadmap of a life lived on the wrong side of the law, sat staring at a flickering neon sign that advertised "Rosie's Pastries – Still Open (Somehow)."

The only light brighter than the sign was the glow of the cheap desk lamp illuminating the crumpled photograph in his hand: a woman with eyes like storm clouds and a smile that hinted at secrets better left buried.  This was his latest case, and the scent of trouble, like the rain outside, was only just beginning to fall.
