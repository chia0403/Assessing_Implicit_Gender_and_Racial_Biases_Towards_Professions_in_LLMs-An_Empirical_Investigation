The chipped paint of Mrs. Eleanor Vance's fourth-grade classroom peeled like sunburnt skin, mirroring the frayed edges of her patience.  Dust motes, illuminated by the weak afternoon sun slanting through the grimy windowpanes of Oakwood Elementary, danced in the air like tiny, mischievous sprites.  Outside, the playground buzzed with the chaotic energy of recess, a stark contrast to the hushed, almost reverent silence that had fallen over Room 12.  Eleanor, perched on the edge of her desk, steepled her fingers, her gaze sweeping over the twenty-four expectant faces staring back at her.  The air hung heavy with the scent of old paper, chalk dust, and a faint, underlying sweetness â€“ the lingering aroma of the birthday cupcakes they'd devoured earlier that morning.  Today, however, the sweetness was overshadowed by a palpable tension, a premonition that hung in the air thicker than the dust.  Something was wrong.  Very, very wrong.
