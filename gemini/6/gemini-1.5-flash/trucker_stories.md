The diesel engine coughed, a phlegmy rumble that vibrated through Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins' worn leather boots.  He gripped the steering wheel of his eighteen-wheeler, the "Midnight Rambler," its chrome gleaming faintly under the bruised purple of a pre-dawn sky.  Outside, the Nevada desert stretched before him, a vast, unforgiving tapestry woven with the dark threads of scrub brush and the pale, skeletal arms of Joshua trees.  The air hung heavy with the scent of sagebrush and the metallic tang of exhaust, a familiar perfume that had clung to Bart for the last twenty years, a testament to a life lived on the endless ribbon of asphalt that was Route 50.  The only sounds were the rhythmic thump of the tires on the blacktop and the whisper of wind whistling through the broken glass of a distant, abandoned gas station â€“ a ghost town in miniature, reflecting the solitude that was Bart's constant companion.
