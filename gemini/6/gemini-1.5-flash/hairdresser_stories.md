The scent of rosemary and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Aurelia “Auri” Bellweather.  It clung to the worn velvet cushions of her salon chair, to the chipped porcelain sink, and even to the faded floral wallpaper that had witnessed countless transformations – from disastrous perms to triumphant updos – over the past thirty years.  Auri, herself, was a testament to the passage of time, her silver hair meticulously braided into a crown around her head, a stark contrast to the vibrant fuchsia streaks peeking out from beneath.  Her salon, "Shear Perfection," nestled on a cobbled side street in the ancient, whimsical town of Port Blossom, was as much a part of her as her own reflection in the cracked mirror behind the styling station.  The rhythmic clang of the sea against the harbour wall provided a steady, comforting soundtrack to the snip-snip-snip of her shears, a constant reminder of the ebb and flow of life, just as unpredictable as the next client who might walk through her door.
