The scent of lavender and sandalwood hung heavy in the air, a comforting balm against the biting November wind howling outside.  Rain lashed against the leaded-glass windows of Serenity Spa, a soothing counterpoint to the rhythmic kneading of Elias Thorne's hands.  Elias, a man whose own hands were as expressive as a seasoned actor's face – capable of both the feather-light touch of a butterfly and the firm, purposeful pressure of a sculptor – was currently working on the knotted muscles of Mrs. Henderson, a retired librarian with a chronic case of upper-back tension.  The soft glow of the Himalayan salt lamp cast a warm, amber hue across the room, illuminating dust motes dancing in the tranquil atmosphere.  Outside, the city of Charleston, South Carolina, was a tempestuous beast; inside Serenity Spa, Elias Thorne was a tranquil island in a storm, his practiced hands working their magic, one aching muscle at a time.
