The salt spray stung Amelia “Mia” Holloway’s face, a fine mist clinging to her already damp eyelashes.  The wind, a raw, untamed beast howling off the churning grey expanse of the Atlantic, threatened to rip the canvas tarp from the weathered wooden platform she stood on. Below, the jagged teeth of the Devil’s Teeth rocks gnawed at the turbulent water, sending up plumes of white foam that mirrored the chaos within her.  Mia gripped her battered Leica M6, its cold metal a comforting weight against her gloved hand.  The battered camera, a legacy from her grandfather, felt as much a part of her as her own breath, a silent witness to the relentless beauty – and brutal indifference – of the Cornish coastline. This lighthouse, perched precariously on the edge of the world, was her sanctuary, her studio, and tonight, the stage for a storm of epic proportions.
