The chipped paint of the "Sunshine Smiles" daycare center flaked like sunburnt skin under the relentless August sun.  Sweat beaded on the forehead of twenty-two-year-old Elara Genevieve Hayes as she wrestled a giggling five-year-old named Leo into a miniature firetruck costume.  The air hung thick with the scent of peanut butter sandwiches, Crayola markers, and the faint, underlying aroma of something vaguelyâ€¦fecal.  Elara, however, inhaled it all with a practiced, if somewhat weary, sigh.  This was her life, a chaotic symphony of tiny humans, sticky fingers, and the ever-present threat of a rogue juice box explosion. Today, however, promised to be particularly challenging.  It was the annual Sunshine Smiles Summer Carnival, and the prospect filled Elara with a mixture of dread and the kind of exhausted optimism only a seasoned childcare worker could muster.
