The salt spray stung Seraphina Moreauâ€™s face, a familiar kiss from the unforgiving Atlantic.  She gripped her easel tighter, the wind threatening to topple it and send her meticulously arranged paints scattering across the jagged rocks of Pointe de Pen-Hir.  Below, the churning grey sea gnawed at the Breton coastline, a furious beast untamed even by the late afternoon sun struggling to pierce the thick, swirling clouds.  The air tasted of brine and ozone, a heady perfume that usually inspired her, but today, the relentless wind mirrored the turmoil in Seraphina's heart.  Her palette, a chaotic swirl of greys, blues, and bruised purples, reflected the tempestuous scene before her, and, perhaps, the tempest within.  The unfinished canvas, propped precariously on the easel, hinted at a stormy seascape, a mirror to her own internal landscape.
