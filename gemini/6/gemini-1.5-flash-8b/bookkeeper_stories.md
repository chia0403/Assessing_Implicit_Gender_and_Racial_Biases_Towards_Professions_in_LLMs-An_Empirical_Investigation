The chipped Formica counter, stained a sickly yellow where decades of spilled coffee had seeped into the linoleum, reflected the flickering fluorescent lights of "The Accounting Owl."  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grime-coated window, illuminating a single, unblinking eye staring back from behind the thick glasses perched on the nose of  Alistair Finch-Hastings, bookkeeper extraordinaire.  He meticulously tallied a column of figures, each number a tiny, precise detail in the complex tapestry of debts and credits, the rhythm of his pen scratching against the worn paper a counterpoint to the rhythmic whir of the ancient, single fan struggling against the oppressive heat.

The Accounting Owl wasn't glamorous.  It wasn't even particularly pleasant.  Located in a forgotten corner of the bustling, yet somehow forlorn, market town of Oakhaven, it held the scent of stale coffee, old paper, and the slightly sour aroma of despair, a fragrance Alistair had come to associate with the anxious breath of his clientele. He knew the worries of every small business owner tucked away within these four, sticky-floored walls. He saw the dreams crushed, the fortunes fluctuating, all in the quiet hum of his office.   The Owl had been his life for the past twenty years, and he wouldn't have it any other way.
