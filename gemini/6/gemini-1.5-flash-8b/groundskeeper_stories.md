The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Blackwood's hands, a meager comfort against the biting November wind that whipped across the manicured lawns of Blackwood Manor.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the skeletal branches of a weeping willow, illuminating a landscape meticulously sculpted to resemble a miniature, frost-bitten forest.  Amelia, her name embroidered onto the faded, green uniform jacket, adjusted the heavy gardening shears.  The wrought iron gates, groaning under the strain of the wind, seemed to echo the ache in her bones.  This was her world:  the silent realm of Blackwood Manor, a world meticulously preserved, yet strangelyâ€¦empty.

The manor itself loomed, a brooding, grey stone behemoth, its windows like cold, unblinking eyes staring down upon the meticulously maintained gardens.  Ivy, thick as ropes, clawed at the stone walls, whispering tales of the long, shadowed history of the Blackwood family.  Amelia knew every shadowed nook and cranny of the gardens; the hidden pathways, the ancient rosebushes, the weeping willow that had been there since before she was born.  Yet, despite her intimate knowledge of the place, a sense of foreboding, as persistent as the encroaching winter, clung to her like damp earth.
