The fluorescent lights of Ms. Eleanor Vanceâ€™s history classroom hummed, a dull counterpoint to the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of student pens.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun slanting through the grimy windowpanes, illuminating the faded posters of World War II battles and the chipped, paint-peeling map of Europe.  Eleanor, a woman whose carefully-coiffed auburn hair seemed to defy the relentless grey of the school hallways, leaned against her desk, a sigh escaping her lips as she stared at the silent expanse of empty desks.  Today's lesson, the rise of fascism, had fallen flat.  Instead of grappling with the complexities of Mussolini's Italy, the whispers of teenage anxieties and the buzz of gossip had filled the classroom like a suffocating fog.  The aroma of stale coffee and something faintly floral, probably the mystery perfume one of the popular girls wore, hung heavy in the air.  It was a Tuesday afternoon in the heart of October, a day that felt as grey and stagnant as the textbooks themselves.  The worn linoleum floor beneath her felt cold and impersonal, mirroring the coldness she felt towards the lack of engagement from her students.  Outside, the crisp autumn air whispered promises of changing leaves and approaching holidays, but inside the classroom, a quiet battle raged.
