The flickering neon sign of the "Rusty Mug" cast long, dancing shadows across Amelia Blackwood's worn apron.  The air in the dimly lit bar hung thick with the scent of stale beer, spilled whiskey, and something indefinably floral that Amelia suspected came from the wilting bouquet on the counter.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless percussion that mirrored the insistent rhythm of the single drop of sweat tracing a path down Amelia's temple. Tonight, the Rusty Mug was more of a mausoleum than a haven, populated by the usual cast of characters: the perpetually melancholy poet nursing a cheap scotch, the boisterous group of construction workers bellowing about the glories of yesteryear, and the lone figure hunched over a back table, lost in the swirling mists of a particularly potent gin and tonic.  Amelia, though, felt no sense of loneliness.  Tonight, the emptiness was palpable, heavy with the unspoken tension of a town bracing itself for a storm brewing far beyond the city limits.
