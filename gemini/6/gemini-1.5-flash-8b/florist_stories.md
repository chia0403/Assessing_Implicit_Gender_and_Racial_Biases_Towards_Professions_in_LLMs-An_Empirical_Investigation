The scent of jasmine and lilies hung thick in the air, a fragrant fog that swirled around Amelia Nightingale, clinging to the silk of her apron and the delicate petals of the roses she arranged.  Sunlight, fractured by the stained-glass windows of "Blooms by the Bay," spilled across the meticulously crafted bouquets, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air like tiny, glittering spirits.

But today, a quiet stillness hung over the air, almost palpable. Outside, the rhythmic crash of the waves against the shore, normally a comforting symphony, sounded oddly amplified, a constant, low hum of expectation.
