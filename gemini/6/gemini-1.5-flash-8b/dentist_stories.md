The flickering fluorescent lights of Dr. Amelia Nightingale's dental office hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *click-clack* of her drill.  Dust motes danced in the pale beams, illuminating the pristine white walls and sterile instruments arranged in gleaming chrome trays.  Outside, the city thrummed with a relentless energy, a stark contrast to the quiet precision of the examination room.  Rain hammered against the windowpane, a relentless percussion that seemed to mirror the persistent throbbing in Amelia's own temples.

The nagging fear that she wasn't seeing the whole picture.  Today, the usual quiet precision of her work feltâ€¦ off.
