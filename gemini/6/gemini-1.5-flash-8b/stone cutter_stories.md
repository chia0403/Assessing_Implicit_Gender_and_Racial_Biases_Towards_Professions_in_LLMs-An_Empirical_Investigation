The chill of the dawn seeped into the quarry, clinging to the damp stone like a shroud.  Dust motes, illuminated by the first rays of the rising sun, danced in the air, mimicking the frantic rhythm of Bartholomew "Barty" Stoneheart's chisel against the granite.  The quarry, nestled deep within the Blackwood Mountains, echoed with the rhythmic clang, a constant symphony of creation and destruction.  Jagged peaks, scarred by centuries of quarrying, framed the vast expanse of grey stone.  A wind, biting and unforgiving, whipped through the clefts in the rock face, carrying with it the scent of pine and the faint, metallic tang of ancient tools. Barty, his face streaked with grime and sweat, focused intently on the colossal block of grey granite before him, a behemoth that seemed to absorb the sun's nascent light.  He was, as always, wrestling with a spirit of stone.
