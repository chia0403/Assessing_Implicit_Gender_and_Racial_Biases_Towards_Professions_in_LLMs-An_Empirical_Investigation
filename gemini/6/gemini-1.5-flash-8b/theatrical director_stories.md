The air in the dusty, echoing rehearsal hall hung thick with the scent of aged wood and forgotten dreams.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the grime-coated window, illuminating a half-finished set â€“ a crumbling archway, draped with tattered velvet, somehow both majestic and pathetic.  This was the heart of "The Obsidian Theatre," a space more haunted than hallowed, a testament to the volatile spirit of its director, Isolde Seraphina Blackwood.

Her tailored black suit, though impeccable in its cut, looked as if it had absorbed the weariness of a hundred failed productions.  A half-empty mug of lukewarm chamomile tea sat on a chipped wooden table, a silent companion to the scattered scripts and costume sketches that littered the surface.  The relentless ticking of a grandfather clock in the corner seemed to mock the stagnant progress.
