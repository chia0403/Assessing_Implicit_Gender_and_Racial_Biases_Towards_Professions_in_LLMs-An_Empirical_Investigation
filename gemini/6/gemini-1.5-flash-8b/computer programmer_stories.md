The fluorescent hum of the server farm vibrated through Elias Thorne's bones.  He hunched over his keyboard, the rows of blinking LEDs a dizzying kaleidoscope in the oppressive darkness.  Outside, the city of Neo-Veridia thrummed with a life he rarely participated in.  He was a creature of the digital, a denizen of the vast network humming beneath the concrete canyons, a computer programmer lost in the labyrinthine code of the Global Nexus.

Empty takeout containers and discarded circuit boards littered the desk, a grim reminder of late nights and caffeine-fueled coding sprints.  The only other inhabitants were the ghosts of the code heâ€™d written, whispering through the circuits of his computer. Elias Thorne, a prodigy by his peers' estimation, a ghost in the machine by his own.
