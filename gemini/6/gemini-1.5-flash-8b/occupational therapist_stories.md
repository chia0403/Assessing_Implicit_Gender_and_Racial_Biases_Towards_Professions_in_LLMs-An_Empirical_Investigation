Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the dilapidated clinic, a relentless percussion that mirrored the rhythm of Amelia Ashworth’s thoughts.  The scent of antiseptic, perpetually damp and tinged with the metallic tang of old blood, hung heavy in the air.  Amelia, a meticulous occupational therapist with sharp grey eyes and hands that moved with practiced grace, surveyed the small, cluttered examination room.  Sunlight, fractured and weak, struggled to pierce the grime-coated windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air.  This wasn’t the gleaming, modern facility she'd envisioned when she'd first arrived in the remote village of Oakhaven, but it was home now, a home forged from necessity and a profound sense of purpose.  She had chosen Oakhaven, with its winding cobbled streets and the palpable weight of history resting on every weathered stone, for its challenge.  Her patient, a stoic, elderly farmer named Silas Blackwood, lay on the worn examination table, his face etched with a weariness that mirrored the landscape around the clinic.  Amelia felt the familiar tug of empathy, a constant companion in her chosen profession.
