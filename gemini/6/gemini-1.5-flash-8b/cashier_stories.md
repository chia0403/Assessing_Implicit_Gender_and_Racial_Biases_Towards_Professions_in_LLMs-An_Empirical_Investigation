The fluorescent lights of the "Corner Grocer" hummed, a relentless drone that seeped into Amelia Hayes's very bones.  Dust motes danced in the pale, sickly yellow glow, reflecting off the chipped linoleum floor.  A faint aroma of stale bread and disinfectant hung heavy in the air, a constant companion to the rhythmic clatter of coins and the occasional exasperated sigh.  Amelia, twenty-two years old and perpetually tired, wiped down the counter with a practiced hand.  Another Tuesday. Another day spent meticulously scanning groceries and fielding the grumbles of disgruntled customers.  Outside, the grey sky mirrored the muted tone of the store itself, promising a day as dreary as the one already unfolding within the four walls of the Corner Grocer.
