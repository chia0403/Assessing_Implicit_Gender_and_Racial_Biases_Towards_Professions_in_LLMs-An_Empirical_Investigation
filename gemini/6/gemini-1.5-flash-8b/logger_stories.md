The biting wind whipped at Silas Blackwood's weathered face, stinging his eyes as he surveyed the scarred landscape.  The ancient pines, once a cathedral of emerald, were now skeletal sentinels, their branches clawing at a sky choked with a perpetually bruised grey.  The air, thick with the resinous scent of pine and the metallic tang of blood, hung heavy and still, a testament to the relentless rhythm of the logging industry.  Silas, a man whose hands were as gnarled and strong as the oak trees he felled, adjusted the thick leather straps of his tool belt, the familiar weight a comfort in this unforgiving wilderness.  He was the last logger in the forgotten valley of the Hemlock Hollows, a place where the echoes of the chainsaw still lingered, a testament to a time when the forests held sway and men were mere caretakers.  His name, Silas Blackwood, was whispered on the winds, a legend in this dying region, a name synonymous with the fall of the old growth.
