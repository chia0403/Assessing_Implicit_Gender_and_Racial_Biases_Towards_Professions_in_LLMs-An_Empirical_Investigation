The brass bell, a chipped and tarnished memento of a forgotten era, swung languidly on its worn-out hook above the entrance of the Grand Imperial Hotel.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the ornate stained-glass window, illuminating the swirling patterns of swirling ivy and forgotten kings.  A faint, almost imperceptible, scent of lilies and mildew clung to the air, a constant companion in the cavernous lobby.  This was the domain of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, bellhop extraordinaire, or perhaps, more accurately, bellhop-by-default, as he meticulously polished a tarnished brass tray.

The Grand Imperial, once a beacon of opulent grandeur, now felt more like a relic, its faded glory a whispered secret in the echoing corridors.  Guests, if one could even call them that, were few and far between, relegated to the hushed tones of their private rooms, their needs communicated in clipped notes and mumbled requests delivered by the perpetually weary concierge.  Barty, with his perpetually weary eyes and perpetually stained uniform, was the unsung hero, the silent guardian of this fading empire.
