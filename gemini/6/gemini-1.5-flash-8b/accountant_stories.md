The fluorescent hum of the office was a constant, almost imperceptible thrumming, a soundtrack to Amelia Blackwood's meticulously ordered existence.  Rows of filing cabinets, lacquered mahogany gleaming under the harsh, utilitarian lighting, lined the walls of the accounting firm, reflecting Amelia's own carefully constructed composure.  Her tailored navy suit, crisp white blouse, and perfectly polished black shoes were a tangible embodiment of the meticulous record-keeping she so diligently practiced.  Amelia, a senior accountant at Sterling & Finch, was a woman who believed in balance sheets and bottom lines, in precise calculations and unwavering logic.  The year was 2024, and the rhythmic ticking of the clock in the corner of the office seemed to mirror the steady, predictable beat of her daily routine.  The only deviation from her programmed schedule was the insistent, almost unnerving silence that had settled over the firm over the past few weeks.  Usually, the office buzzed with the clatter of keyboards, the hushed murmur of colleagues, the occasional phone call echoing from the main reception area.  Now, only the hum of the fluorescent lights and the methodical click-clack of Amelia's own keyboard broke the silence.
