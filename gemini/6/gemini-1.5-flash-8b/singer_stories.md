The flickering neon sign of the "Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow on Amelia Nightingale's face.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic rhythm drumming in her chest.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of stale beer and desperation.  Amelia, a wisp of a girl with eyes the colour of stormy seas, adjusted the microphone stand, the polished metal a cold contrast to her trembling hands.  Tonight, the only audience was the echoing emptiness of the dimly lit bar, and the gnawing fear that tonight, like so many before, she'd fail.

Amelia Nightingale, twenty-two years old and already haunted by the ghosts of missed opportunities, wasn't born for this.  This backwater town, nestled in the foothills of the jagged Appalachian Mountains, wasn't where she envisioned her life unfolding.  Her dreams, like the faded posters of pop idols plastered on the walls of the Rusty Mug, were painted with the shimmering colours of bustling city stages, not the muted hues of this forgotten corner of the world.  But, for now, the Rusty Mug was her stage, the muted roar of the rain her only applause.
