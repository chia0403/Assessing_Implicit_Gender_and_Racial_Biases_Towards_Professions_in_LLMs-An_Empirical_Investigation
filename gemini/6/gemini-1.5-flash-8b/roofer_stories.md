Rain hammered against the corrugated iron of the dilapidated warehouse, a relentless percussion that mirrored the rhythm of Silas Blackwood's footsteps across the precarious scaffolding.  Silas Blackwood, a man whose weathered hands and face spoke volumes of countless climbs and falls, swore the building was trying to swallow him whole.  He was perched precariously high above the bustling, rain-slicked streets of the port city, the only sound besides the storm the distant cries of gulls circling the masts of the shipping freighters.  The city, a sprawling labyrinth of grey stone and steel, pressed in on him, a concrete jungle hungry for the scrap of metal he was trying to secure.

The setting was the Docks of Alderhaven, a port city on the grey, windswept coast of the North Sea.  The ceaselessly howling wind, carrying the salt spray and the pungent aroma of fish,  combined with the rain to create an atmosphere of gritty realism.  Old warehouses, their walls scarred with time and storms, lined the waterfront, their corrugated iron roofs and shattered windows reflecting the grey hues of the sky.  The air, thick with the smell of brine and the oily residue of ship-repairing yards, clung to everything.  Towering cranes, skeletal fingers clawing at the sky, pointed to the vast expanse of the unforgiving ocean. The city pulsed with a relentless, low hum of industrial activity, a stark contrast to the isolated and tempestuous world Silas inhabited high above it all.
