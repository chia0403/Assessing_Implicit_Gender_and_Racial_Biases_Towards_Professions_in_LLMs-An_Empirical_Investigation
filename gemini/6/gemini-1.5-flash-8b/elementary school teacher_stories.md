The fluorescent lights of Mrs. Eleanor Ainsworth's classroom hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the restless rustling of papers and the occasional, muffled snicker.  Eleven-year-old Amelia clutched a crumpled drawing, her brow furrowed in concentration.  It was Wednesday, the day dedicated to the "Fantastic Fauna of the Forest" unit, and Amelia was, as always, struggling to capture the essence of a mythical creature.  Her pencil, poised over the paper, felt heavier than a lead weight.  Outside, the October wind howled like a tormented banshee, rattling the ancient oak trees that lined the school's perimeter.

The classroom, a small, rectangular space crammed with desks, felt claustrophobic, even on a day like this when the world outside was on the verge of winter's embrace.  Sunlight, thin and pale, filtered through the grimy windowpanes, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air.  A collection of dried pressed leaves, a testament to a long-ago field trip, lay scattered on the teacher's desk, alongside a half-eaten apple and a stack of overflowing lesson plans.  A faded poster depicting a cheerful cartoon squirrel, its eyes wide with exaggerated wonder, stared blankly from the wall.  Mrs. Ainsworth, her auburn hair pulled back in a tight bun, moved silently around the room, her worn cardigan seeming to absorb the classroomâ€™s anxieties.
