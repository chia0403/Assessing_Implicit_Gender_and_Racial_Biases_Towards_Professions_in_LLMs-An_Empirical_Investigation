The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine and something faintly metallic, like old pennies.  Dr. Amelia Petrova, meticulously dressed in a crisp linen blazer over a crisp white shirt, adjusted her spectacles, her brow furrowed in concentration.  Sunlight, filtered through the dense foliage of the mango trees, dappled the courtyard of the Casa del Sol, illuminating dust motes dancing in the still air.  The vibrant colours of the surrounding hillside, a riot of ochre, terracotta, and emerald green, clashed with the stark white of the colonial-era building.  This was El Mirador, a small, picturesque town nestled high in the Andes Mountains of Colombia, a place where the rhythms of life seemed to slow to a deliberate crawl.  Amelia, a registered dietician with a PhD in nutritional epidemiology, was here on a three-month fellowship, studying the impact of traditional Andean diets on the prevalence of malnutrition in the region.  Her mission: to understand the delicate balance between ancient wisdom and modern necessity.
