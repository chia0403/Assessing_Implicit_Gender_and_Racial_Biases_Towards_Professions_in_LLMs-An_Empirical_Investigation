The fluorescent hum of the highway toll booth was a lullaby to Silas Blackwood, a lullaby he’d grown to hate.  He hadn't slept properly in three days, a fact reflected in the grim lines etched around his tired eyes and the way his knuckles whiter than his beard pressed against the worn leather of the steering wheel.  His rig, a battered but dependable Peterbilt named "The Ironclad," rumbled impatiently, its massive engine sighing in protest at the enforced stop.  Dust devils danced across the cracked asphalt of the desolate stretch of Route 66, mirroring the chaos swirling within Silas's mind.

Setting:  A scorching Arizona desert landscape, midday.  The sun beat down mercilessly on the vast, empty stretches of Route 66, the asphalt shimmering like a molten river.  Scattered cacti stood like skeletal sentinels against the endless expanse of ochre and brown.  The only signs of life were the occasional dust-cloud of another trucker’s rig and the distant, shimmering heat haze on the horizon.  A dilapidated, almost forgotten rest stop, with peeling paint and rusted metal, lay just off the road, a melancholic reminder of lost promises and forgotten dreams.
