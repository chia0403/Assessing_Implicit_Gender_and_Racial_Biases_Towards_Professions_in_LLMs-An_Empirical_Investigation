The chipped porcelain sink, stained a faded butter yellow, reflected the flickering gaslight spilling from the hallway.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of illumination, illuminating the swirling patterns of condensation clinging to the chipped enamel.  Elara Evangeline Nightingale, librarian at the Whispering Woods Public Library, sighed, the sound lost in the hushed emptiness of the back stacks.  Her fingers, stained with the lingering scent of aged paper and leather-bound volumes, traced the worn inscription on a centuries-old ledger.  "To preserve the whispers of time," it read, a sentiment that weighed heavily on Elara tonight.

The Whispering Woods Library wasn't your typical public library.  Nestled deep within the ancient, whispering woods that bordered the town of Oakhaven, it was a hidden sanctuary, its stone walls interwoven with the very roots of the towering trees.  Giant, moss-covered bookshelves stretched into the gloom, their spines groaning in the stillness, each containing secrets only the rustling leaves seemed to understand.  Moonlight, fractured and filtered through the dense canopy, painted ethereal patterns on the floor, casting long, skeletal shadows that danced with the shifting whispers of the wind.  Tonight, however, the whispers felt sharper, more urgent than usual.  The air itself seemed to hum with an unseen energy.
