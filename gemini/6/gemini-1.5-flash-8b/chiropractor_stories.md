Her office, "The Spinal Alignment," nestled between a bakery with a perpetually overflowing window display and a struggling antique shop, was the only sign of life in this sleepy hamlet.

Oakhaven, nestled in a valley shrouded by towering pines, had always felt like a forgotten jewel, its charm buried beneath layers of quiet expectation and the pervasive scent of pine needles.  The air, thick with the dampness of a recent rain, carried the faintest whiff of woodsmoke and the distant, melodic call of a rooster.  The town boasted a population barely exceeding 500 souls, each seemingly content in their isolated routines. Yet, beneath this placid surface, whispers of an unsettling mystery had begun to circulate, their voices growing louder with each passing week.
