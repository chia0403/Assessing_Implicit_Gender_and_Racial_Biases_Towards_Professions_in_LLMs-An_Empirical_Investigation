The biting wind howled a mournful dirge across the cracked earth of the Obsidian Wastes, whipping sand into stinging lashes against the weathered face of Sergeant Kael Dorn.  The sun, a pale disc sinking towards the jagged, crimson peaks, cast long, skeletal shadows that danced with the swirling dust devils.  Kael, his worn leather jerkin clinging to his frame, surveyed the desolate landscape.  For thirty years, the Obsidian Wastes had been his domain, his prison, and his only home.  He knew these endless plains as intimately as the lines etched into his calloused palms.  He knew the whispers of the wind, the rustle of the rare desert flora, the telltale signs of approaching storms, and the unnerving silence that preceded them.  Every rustle, every shadow, was a potential threat in this unforgiving land. Tonight, however, the silence held a different kind of weight, a pregnant anticipation that unnerved him even more than the usual dread of the Wastes.
