The biting wind whipped Dr. Elara Nightingale's long auburn hair across her face as she wrestled with a stubborn, bleating mountain goat.  The jagged peaks of the Swiss Alps, sculpted by centuries of glacial fury, loomed around her, their granite faces reflecting the pale winter sun.  She knelt on the icy, moss-covered slope, her leather gloves stiff with the cold, her breath puffing out in white clouds.  The goat, a magnificent creature with a coat the color of a storm cloud, bucked and kicked, its hooves scattering icy pebbles that echoed eerily in the stillness.  This wasn't a typical clinic visit.  This was the high country, a world apart from the sterile efficiency of the animal hospital she usually managed.  The nearest human settlement, a tiny village nestled deep in the valley, was a day's arduous hike away.  Dr. Nightingale, a veterinarian with a tenacity as sharp as the alpine needles, had chosen a life less conventional, a life of healing and understanding among the wild creatures that called these peaks home.
