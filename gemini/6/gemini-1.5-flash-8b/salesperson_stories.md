The fluorescent lights of the "Everything You Need for a Better Tomorrow" store hummed, a relentless soundtrack to Amelia Nightingale's anxieties.  The scent of freshly-waxed floors and cheap, synthetic pine cleaner clung to the air, a comforting yet stifling aroma.  Amelia, twenty-seven, stared at the meticulously organized display of power banks, each one nestled in a tiny, plastic cradle, like precious jewels.  This was her life, meticulously curated, like the meticulously organized shelves around her.  A life of carefully chosen products and even more carefully chosen words, designed to elicit the perfect response from potential customers. A salesperson, through and through.

The store, a sprawling behemoth in the heart of the ever-expanding suburbia, was designed for efficiency.  Every aisle, every shelf, every product, meticulously placed for maximum impact.  Rows of gleaming appliances lined the walls, their sleek surfaces reflecting the fluorescent lights in a hypnotic dance.  Further back, hidden behind a curtain of beige fabric, sat the "experience zones," designed to immerse customers in the future.  But Amelia found herself staring at the power banks, their tiny LEDs blinking a dull, monotonous light.  Today, the future seemed as far off as the distant, hazy promise printed on the cardboard boxes that held the future-defining devices.
