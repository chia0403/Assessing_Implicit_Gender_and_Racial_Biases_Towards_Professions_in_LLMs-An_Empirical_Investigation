Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the small clinic, a relentless rhythm that mirrored the pounding headache thrumming in Amelia Blackwood's temples.  The air, thick with the smell of antiseptic and damp earth, clung to her like a second skin.  Amelia, a physical therapist with a perpetually tired smile and eyes that held the weight of countless patient stories, stared out the grimy window.  The sprawling, overgrown garden beyond was a canvas of muted greys and deep greens, its colours mirroring the muted tones of her own life lately.  The clinic, "Hope Springs," was located in the heart of the Rust Belt, a forgotten corner of a once-great industrial town.  Brick buildings, scarred by time and neglect, lined the streets, their windows like vacant eyes staring out at the dreary landscape.  Today, the patient waiting room held a particular tension, a sense of unspoken anxiety heavier than the damp air.  Amelia knew, deep down, that today wouldn't be like the others.  Something was different. This wasn't just a routine appointment.
