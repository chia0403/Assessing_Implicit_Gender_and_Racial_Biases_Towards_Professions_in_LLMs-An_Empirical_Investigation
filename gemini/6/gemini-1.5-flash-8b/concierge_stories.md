The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Blackwood's hands, a meager comfort against the biting November wind whistling through the gaps in the grand, yet slightly dilapidated, wrought iron gates of the Blackwood Manor.  The manor, a sprawling gothic masterpiece perched atop a windswept hill overlooking the misty valley of Alderwood, was her domain, or rather, the domain of its many eccentric residents.  Amelia, Concierge Extraordinaire (a title she'd bestowed upon herself with quiet pride), was the silent guardian, the discreet translator, the unflappable mediator of their often-conflicting needs and desires.  Tonight, the wind carried a particularly insistent rumour: the arrival of Lord Ashworth and his elusive collection of antique clockwork automatons.  

Amelia, dressed in her signature emerald green uniform, a stark contrast to the muted browns and greys of the manor's exterior, adjusted her spectacles. The scent of woodsmoke, mingling with the sharp tang of pine and damp earth, hung heavy in the air, a familiar companion of the manor's isolated setting.  The rhythmic tick-tock of a distant grandfather clock echoed across the courtyard, a stark reminder of the passage of time and the countless stories whispered within the walls of the manor.  Tonight, a new chapter was about to begin, and Amelia, with a quiet sigh, prepared to welcome the unknown.
