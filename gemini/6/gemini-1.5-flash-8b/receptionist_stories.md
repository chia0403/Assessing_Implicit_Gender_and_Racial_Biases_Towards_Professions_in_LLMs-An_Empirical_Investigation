The fluorescent lights of the "Apex Legal" office hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Josephine Finch's life.  She was, in her own estimation, a very good receptionist.  Efficient, pleasant, and utterly unremarkable.  Her days consisted of answering phones, sorting mail, and ensuring the flow of paperwork was as smooth as a freshly ironed shirt.  Amelia didn't mind the routine. In fact, she thrived on it.  It was predictable, safe.  A comforting blanket against the ever-shifting anxieties of the outside world.

The office, tucked away on a quiet side street in the heart of the city's legal district, was a study in muted tones.  Creamy walls, polished mahogany desks, and leather armchairs whispered of power and discretion.  Natural light, filtered through heavy curtains, cast a soft glow over the space, enhancing the overall sense of quiet dignity.  Tall, imposing bookcases lined the walls, filled with thick volumes of case law that seemed to stare down from their elevated positions.  A subtle, almost imperceptible scent of old paper and leather hung in the air, a scent Amelia had come to associate with the quiet authority of the law.  A single, unassuming potted fern sat on a desk in the corner, a small splash of green life in the otherwise subdued environment.  Today, however, the hum of the fluorescent lights seemed slightly louder, the quiet dignity subtly frayed.
