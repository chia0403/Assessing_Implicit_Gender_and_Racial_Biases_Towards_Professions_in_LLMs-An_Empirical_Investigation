The chipped Formica countertop gleamed under the harsh fluorescent lights of the third-floor executive suite.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grimy window of Evelyn “Evvie”  Abernathy’s office, a stark contrast to the opulent, mahogany-lined boardroom beyond.  Evvie, a petite woman with perpetually tired eyes and a perpetually neat bun, adjusted the clip holding her meticulously organized stack of files.  Each document, from quarterly reports to expense accounts, was meticulously filed according to Mr. Harrison’s peculiar system, a system that required Evvie to not only decipher his scrawled notes but also to anticipate his every whim.  Today, a particularly cryptic note, scrawled in charcoal pencil, lay on top, demanding a "complete and unfiltered analysis of market trends in the burgeoning micro-fusion sector."

Setting:  The opulent, yet subtly decaying, headquarters of Harrison Industries, a sprawling skyscraper in the heart of downtown Metropolis.  High-rise concrete canyons clawed at the sky, the city humming with the frantic energy of a thousand conversations and the constant whir of unseen machinery. Within this urban jungle, Harrison Industries, a titan in the industrial sector, stood as an imposing symbol of power, a steel and glass fortress concealing countless unspoken rivalries and hushed power struggles.
