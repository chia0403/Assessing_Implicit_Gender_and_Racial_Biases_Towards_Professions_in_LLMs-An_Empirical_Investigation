The pneumatic tubes, humming with the relentless thrum of compressed air, seemed to whisper secrets of the market to Elias Thorne, Jr., a stock broker at the hallowed halls of Sterling & Steele.  Sunlight, filtered through the towering glass facade of the brokerage, cast long, dancing shadows across the polished floors of the trading floor.  A symphony of ringing phones, the insistent click-clack of keyboards, and the hurried murmur of voices formed a constant, frenetic background noise.  Elias, dressed impeccably in a charcoal grey suit, felt the familiar pressure building in his chest.  Today was the day.  He was about to make a move that could catapult him to the upper echelons of the firm, or shatter the meticulously crafted foundation of his career.


**Setting:** The trading floor of Sterling & Steele, a prestigious New York City brokerage firm, circa 1980s.  The atmosphere is tense and exhilarating, a high-stakes ballet of human energy and mechanical whirring.  The view out of the imposing skyscraper windows is obscured by a dense, hazy smog that is a characteristic of the city.
