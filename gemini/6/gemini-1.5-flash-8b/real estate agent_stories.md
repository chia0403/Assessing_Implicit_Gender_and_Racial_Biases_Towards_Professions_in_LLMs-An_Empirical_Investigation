The biting wind whipped Amelia Hawthorne’s scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks as she surveyed the crumbling Victorian.  Grey skies mirrored the despair etched into the boarded-up windows.  Dust motes danced in the pale sunlight, illuminating the peeling paint and broken eaves like a macabre ballet.  This was 17 Elm Street, the latest property on Amelia's meticulously curated list of "challenging" listings for Hawthorne Realty.  It hadn't been easy to convince her superiors, let alone potential buyers, that this fixer-upper held any charm whatsoever.  The previous owner, a reclusive recluse named Mrs. Ainsworth, had apparently considered "rustic" to be synonymous with "ruined."  Amelia, however, saw potential.  She saw a whisper of grandeur beneath the layers of neglect, a chance to breathe life back into a forgotten piece of the city's history.

The setting was the fictional town of Ashwood, Massachusetts.  A picturesque, yet struggling, town nestled in the foothills of the Berkshire mountains, clinging to the edges of a booming tech-driven economy.  Ashes of industrial history mingled with aspirations for a boutique artisan scene.  Old brick buildings, slowly being reclaimed by ivy and time, stood next to gleaming, modern shops selling organic produce and handcrafted jewelry.  This juxtaposition, a delicate balance between the past and the future, was a microcosm of the town’s overall character—and reflected directly in the kinds of properties Amelia Hawthorne dealt with.
