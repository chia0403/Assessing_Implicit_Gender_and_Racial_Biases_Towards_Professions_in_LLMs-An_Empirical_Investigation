The air hung thick and grey, a suffocating miasma of sawdust and stale coffee, clinging to Amelia "Amy" Cartwright like a second skin.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom of the drafting room.  A symphony of whirring, clattering, and the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of mechanical pencils filled the space, a constant, almost unbearable drone.  Amy, hunched over a drafting table groaning under the weight of blueprints and technical schematics, traced a meticulously detailed line with a poised hand.  Her fingers, stained a perpetual sepia from years of handling blueprints, moved with practiced ease.  It was a dance, a ballet of precision, performed in the hushed, industrial heart of the sprawling metropolis, a dance that was, paradoxically, both fulfilling and profoundly isolating.  The city of Zenith, a sprawling behemoth of steel and glass, roared outside, oblivious to the quiet, dedicated work taking place within its imposing, brick-walled bowels.

**Setting:**

The Zenith Drafting Department, located in the cavernous underbelly of the city's central district.  The room was a dimly lit, rectangular space, lined with long, heavy drafting tables.  Tall, imposing windows, frosted to reduce glare, let in only the scantest of daylight.  The smell of old paper, graphite, and slightly burnt coffee hung heavy in the air.  The constant, low hum of machinery and the rhythmic click-clack of mechanical pencils formed the backdrop to the muted sounds of focused concentration.  Outside, Zenith, a city of towering skyscrapers and bustling, neon-lit streets, existed in a stark contrast to the quiet, precise world of the drafting room.
