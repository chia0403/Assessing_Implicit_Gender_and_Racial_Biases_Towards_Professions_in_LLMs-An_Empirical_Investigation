The biting wind, a relentless razor, sliced through the skeletal branches of the lone cottonwood that marked the halfway point between Dust Bowl and Dead Man's Curve.  Dust, the persistent, ochre-hued plague of the American plains, swirled around Amelia "Amy"  Hawkins, coating her worn coveralls in a gritty film.  The midday sun, a malevolent eye in the pale sky, beat down on her back, baking the cracked earth to a crisp.  Amy, her face a roadmap of weathered lines, adjusted the strap of her toolbox.  The rhythmic thump-thump of her jackhammer echoed across the desolate landscape, a lonely counterpoint to the wind's mournful howl.

This stretch of Interstate 80, a ribbon of asphalt snaking through the heart of the Dust Bowl, was Amy's domain.  Not the glamorous kind of domain, where gleaming chrome and opulent hotels lined the route.  This was the quiet, uncelebrated, sun-scorched domain of cracked pavement, broken shoulders, and the ever-present threat of sudden storms.  A domain where the only company was the occasional dust devil, the distant honk of a truck, and the silent, watchful gaze of the endless sky.
