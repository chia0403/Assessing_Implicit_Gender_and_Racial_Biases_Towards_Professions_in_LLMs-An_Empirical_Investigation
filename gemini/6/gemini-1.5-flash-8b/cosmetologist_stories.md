The fluorescent lights of "Hair Rhapsody" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Elara Seraphina Beaumont's daily symphony of shears and smiles.  Dust motes danced in the beams, illuminating the intricate patterns woven into the vibrant hair extensions displayed in the glass cabinet.  The salon, tucked away on a quiet side street in the bustling heart of New Haven, Connecticut, smelled perpetually of lavender and rosemary, a comforting aroma that masked the faint metallic tang of fear that sometimes lingered in the air.  Elara, with her perpetually windswept auburn hair and eyes that held the deep pools of a stormy sea, was expertly maneuvering a pair of fine-toothed combs through a client's thick, dark braid.  It was a Tuesday afternoon, and the usual murmur of conversation and the rhythmic click-clack of scissors were subdued, a hush settling over the space that felt heavier than usual.
