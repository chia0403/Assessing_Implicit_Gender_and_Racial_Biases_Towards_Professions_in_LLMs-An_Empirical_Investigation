The flickering neon sign of the "Golden Hammer" bar cast a sickly yellow glow across Bartholomew "Barty"  Fitzwilliam's face as he wrestled with a stubborn junction box.  Sweat beaded on his forehead, mixing with the grime that coated his overalls.  The air hung thick with the smell of stale beer and ozone, a familiar cocktail in the cramped basement workshop that served as his makeshift electrical repair shop.  Dust motes danced in the single, weak shaft of light piercing the gloom.

This wasn't your typical suburban garage.  The Golden Hammer, a dive bar tucked away on a forgotten corner of the city, had been a persistent problem for Barty.  Wiring issues were relentless, seemingly multiplying like unruly vines in the neglected electrical system.  Barty, a man built like a sturdy oak, with calloused hands and eyes that had seen more than their share of faulty circuits, was the only one who could seem to tame the beast.  His worn leather-bound notebook filled with cryptic diagrams and hand-drawn schematics was his constant companion, a testament to years of troubleshooting. This particular night, however, felt different.  The humming, the crackling, the general electrical instability was almost... sentient.
