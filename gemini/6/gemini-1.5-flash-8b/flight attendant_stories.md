The fluorescent lights of the Boeing 787 hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic thrum of the engines.  Amelia "Amy"  Carter, her name tag practically glowing in the dim cabin light, expertly navigated the aisle, a practiced smile plastered across her face.  Outside, the clouds blurred into a swirling gray canvas, mirroring the tempest brewing within her.  The flight, scheduled to touch down in Los Angeles, felt impossibly far away, each passing minute an eternity.  This was Amy's third consecutive long-haul flight, a blur of sandwiches, drinks, and strained smiles.  The constant hum of the plane and the hushed murmurs of her fellow passengers were the only sounds piercing the growing anxiety in her chest.

The setting was the middle of the night, somewhere over the vast expanse of the Atlantic Ocean.  Amy was positioned near the back of the plane, the rows stretching out before her, filled with passengers who had long since resigned themselves to the journey, cocooned in their personal pods of sleep and quiet.  Empty seats lined the aisle, a stark contrast to the overflowing feeling in Amy's own chest. The cabin air, recycled and sterile, seemed to deepen the oppressive atmosphere.
