Maisie, Paramedic 47, adjusted her oxygen mask and pulled the collar of her coat higher.  A chill deeper than the frigid air settled in her bones, a chilling premonition that whispered of a long night.  Below her, in the vast expanse of the snow-covered parking lot, lay the hulking, boxy form of the ambulance, its red flashing lights casting a muted glow on the surrounding pines.  Hope's Haven, nestled in the remote Appalachian Mountains, was a sanctuary of sorts, a place for the fading, the weary, and the very ill.  But tonight, the serenity was shattered.  A call had come in just before dusk, a frantic plea for help from the secluded cabin nestled amongst the towering pines just a little ways beyond the hospice perimeter.  The air, thick with the scent of pine needles and impending doom, carried the faintest whisper of something else, something acrid and metallic that pricked Maisie's nostrils and intensified the growing sense of dread in her stomach.
