The chill of the early November air snaked through the gaps in the boarded-up windows of "The Cleaver's Cut," a butcher shop nestled between a derelict bakery and a crumbling antique store on the edge of Oakhaven.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the grime-coated gloom, illuminating the glistening, crimson-stained slab that formed the heart of Bartholomew "Barty" Blackwood's domain.  Barty, a man whose hands, weathered and calloused from years of cleaving and carving, were stained a perpetual shade of rose, surveyed the dwindling stock of meat.  A lone, plump goose, its feathers ruffled and its gaze fixed on the unseen, shivered faintly in a wire cage near the back.  The shopâ€™s familiar scent, a heady mix of aged blood, spiced seasonings, and something faintly metallic, hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma to Barty but a pungent affront to the sensibilities of anyone passing by.
