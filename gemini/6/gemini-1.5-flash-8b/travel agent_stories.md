The flickering neon sign of "Globetrotters' Guides" cast a sickly yellow glow across Amelia Butterfield’s meticulously organized desk.  Paperclips, like tiny, metallic stars, clung to the edges of brochures depicting exotic locales:  the snow-capped peaks of the Himalayas, the vibrant markets of Marrakech, the turquoise waters of the Maldives.  Amelia, a travel agent with a heart as vast as the world she sold, stared out the grimy window of her tiny office in the heart of bustling, yet somehow perpetually twilight, Manchester.  Rain hammered against the glass, mirroring the relentless drumming of deadlines in her head.  Her meticulously colour-coded calendar screamed of missed flights, cancelled bookings, and the looming threat of a client’s disastrously delayed safari.  Today was particularly bad.  Not just a single, delayed flight, but a series of cascading cancellations, triggering a frantic chain reaction threatening to unravel a meticulously planned family holiday to the Galapagos Islands.
