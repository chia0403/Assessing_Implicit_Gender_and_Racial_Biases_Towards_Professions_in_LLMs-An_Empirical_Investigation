The chipped paint of the "Ancient Wonders of Xylos" sign, peeling like sunburnt skin, mocked Amelia Seraphina Blackwoodâ€™s meticulously crafted itinerary.  Rain, the consistency of a fine, persistent mist, plastered the weathered wood of the observation deck to a damp, grey sheen. Below, the Xylos River snaked through a valley choked with towering, moss-draped trees, their branches reaching out like skeletal fingers towards the sky.  Amelia, wrapped in a thick wool coat that did little to stem the chill, adjusted her worn leather satchel.  Her breath puffed white in the air, clinging to the already dampened foliage.  This was her tenth season leading the "Hidden Depths" tour, a journey through the forgotten reaches of Xylos, and each year the place felt more alien, more shrouded in an ancient, unknowable mystery.  Today, however, the mystery wasn't shrouded; it was palpable, hanging heavy in the air, a tangible thing she could almost taste.  Whispers, faint at first, then growing louder, emanated from the dense forest, punctuated by the constant, rhythmic drumming of unseen wings.  She pressed her ear to the cold wood, trying to discern the source of the unusual sounds, a sense of foreboding tightening in her chest.
