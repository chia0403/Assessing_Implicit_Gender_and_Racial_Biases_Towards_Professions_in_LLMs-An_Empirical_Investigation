The biting wind howled a mournful dirge through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks that ringed the village of Oakhaven.  Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of Elias Blackwood’s workshop, a small, but sturdy, structure nestled amongst the cobbled streets.  Elias Blackwood, a carpenter with hands weathered like the gnarled wood he loved, hunched over his workbench.  The flickering light of a single oil lamp cast long, dancing shadows across the tools scattered around him:  mallets, chisels, planes, all polished to a dark sheen.  He traced the contours of a meticulously carved wooden dragon’s head, its scales meticulously inlaid with mother-of-pearl, and a faint smile touched his lips, a smile that spoke of both dedication and quiet joy.  The workshop, while filled with the familiar aroma of sawdust and linseed oil, held a peculiar stillness, broken only by the rhythmic creak of the wind rattling the windows and the occasional drip, drip, drip of the rain.  Oakhaven, usually bustling with the cries of children and the rhythmic clang of blacksmiths' hammers, was eerily quiet.  Something was amiss, something heavy and unspoken, hanging in the air like the damp mist that clung to the valley floor.
