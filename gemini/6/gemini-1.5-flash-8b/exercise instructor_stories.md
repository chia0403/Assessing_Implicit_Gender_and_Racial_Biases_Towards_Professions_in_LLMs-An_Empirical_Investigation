The humid air hung thick and heavy, clinging to Amelia Nightingale like a second skin.  Sweat beaded on her brow, blurring the already hazy lines of the outdoor fitness circuit.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun, painting the overgrown path with shimmering streaks of gold.  Amelia, a lean woman with a vibrant, sun-kissed complexion and eyes that held a fierce intensity, expertly guided a group of slightly-over-enthusiastic participants through a series of plyometrics.  Her voice, usually a steady baritone that cut through the clamor of the jungle gym-like park, was strained. The rhythmic thump-thump-thump of their feet on the cracked asphalt was a relentless counterpoint to the cicadasâ€™ incessant buzz.  Around her, the verdant, chaotic greenery of the abandoned urban park, a sprawling oasis of overgrown flora amidst the concrete sprawl of the city, formed a vibrant and chaotic backdrop. This was her domain, her sanctuary, the urban jungle she cultivated into a temporary haven of fitness and camaraderie.
