The flickering fluorescent lights of the waiting room hummed a monotonous tune, punctuated only by the rhythmic *tap-tap-tap* of Dr. Eleanor Vance's pen against her notepad.  Outside, the relentless November rain hammered against the frosted glass windows of the small, suburban practice, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  Rain-slicked leaves clung to the ivy-covered facade, a stark contrast to the meticulously organized, if slightly sterile, interior.  Empty coffee cups lined the reception desk, cold reminders of previous sessions, previous struggles, and the quiet desperation that seemed to cling to the very air in the room. Eleanor, her name etched discreetly on the corner of her worn leather-bound journal, knew this was one of those days.

The setting: a small, independent counseling practice nestled in the quiet cul-de-sac of Oakhaven, a leafy suburb outside a bustling city.  The practice itself was a charming, if somewhat worn, Victorian house, its faded paint and overgrown gardens hinting at a history both comfortable and slightly melancholic.  The muted colors and soft lighting of the waiting room, intended to be soothing, somehow felt more oppressive than comforting.  Eleanor's small office, just beyond the waiting room, was a sanctuary of sorts â€“ a quiet haven filled with the comforting scent of old books and the faint aroma of lavender-infused candles. But even here, the storm raged.
