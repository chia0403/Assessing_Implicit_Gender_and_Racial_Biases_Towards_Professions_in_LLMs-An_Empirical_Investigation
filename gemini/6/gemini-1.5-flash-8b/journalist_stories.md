The biting wind whipped Amelia Stone's crimson scarf around her face, stinging her cheeks as she hunkered down beside the rusted metal barricade.

The only sound besides the relentless waves was the rhythmic creak of the pier's skeletal remains beneath her feet.  This was no simple missing person case; there was something…more.  Something unnatural hanging in the air, thick and suffocating as the fog that seemed to cling to the hills like a shroud.
