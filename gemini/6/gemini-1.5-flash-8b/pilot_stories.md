The biting wind whipped Amelia "Milly"  Everest's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks like a thousand tiny needles.  Below, the jagged peaks of the Himalayas, shrouded in a perpetual twilight, seemed to claw at the bruised, twilight-grey sky.  Milly, her breath misting in the frigid air, adjusted the controls of her sleek, silver-and-black vintage plane, the "Sky Wanderer."  The rhythmic thump of the engine, a comforting lullaby in the desolate expanse, was the only sound that pierced the oppressive silence.  She was alone, a tiny speck against the immense, indifferent backdrop of the world.  

The setting: The unforgiving high-altitude plains of the eastern Himalayas, bordering the remote kingdom of Zanskar.  This was a region where legend intertwined with harsh reality, where ancient monasteries clung to sheer rock faces, and the air thinned to a whisper.  Milly, a seasoned aerial surveyor for the Everest Research Institute, had flown countless times over this terrain, mapping its hidden valleys and treacherous passes.  But this flight felt different.  An unsettling premonition, a sense of unease, clung to her like the mountain fog. The usual radio chatter with the ground control was silent, the distant peaks seemed to watch her with an eerie stillness.
