The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual apricot from years of spilled nail polish and forgotten lemon slices, reflected the harsh fluorescent light above.  Amelia Rose Hawthorne, manicurist extraordinaire (or so she liked to think), meticulously filed a pinky nail, the rhythmic *click* of the file a counterpoint to the insistent hum of the city outside her small, cluttered salon.  Outside, the relentless August sun beat down on the grimy brick streets of the Lower East Side, a symphony of honking taxis and hurried footsteps a constant backdrop to Amelia's quiet, focused world.  Her salon, "Painted Nails," nestled between a bodega overflowing with vibrant produce and a struggling record store, was a testament to her resourceful spirit.  A scattering of vibrant nail polish bottles, each with a story etched onto their labels, lined the countertop, their colours a riotous explosion of summer.  Amelia, with her perpetually smudged eyeliner and a patient hand, was preparing for another day of sculpting beauty, one nail at a time.
