The fluorescent lights of Dr. Anya Petrova's office hummed, a relentless counterpoint to the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Amelia Hayes's gloved fingers on the polished stainless steel tray.  Amelia, a dental hygienist with a name that evoked images of quiet strength and unwavering resolve, meticulously arranged the instruments – the sleek, grey scalers, the polished explorer, the delicate curettes.  Her workspace, tucked away in a quiet corner of the bustling downtown dental practice, was a symphony of muted sounds – the soft, rhythmic whir of the air compressor, the occasional muffled cough from a patient, and the steady pulse of her own heartbeat.  The afternoon sun, filtering through the large window, cast long shadows across the sterile white walls, highlighting the dust motes dancing in the air.  This was Amelia's sanctuary, her battlefield, and for the next few hours, it would be her responsibility to ensure the well-being of her patients' oral health.
