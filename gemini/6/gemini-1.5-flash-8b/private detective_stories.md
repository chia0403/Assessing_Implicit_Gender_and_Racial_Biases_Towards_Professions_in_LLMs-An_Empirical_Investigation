The flickering neon sign of the "Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow on Amelia "Ace"  Montgomery's rain-slicked trench coat.  The alley reeked of stale beer and something faintly metallic, a scent that tugged at the edges of her already frayed nerves.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron walls, each drop a tiny, insistent hammer blow against the suffocating quiet.  This was the heart of the city's underbelly, a place where whispers travelled faster than the police sirens, and secrets were traded for crumpled bills.  Ace, a private investigator with eyes the colour of stormy seas and a reputation as sharp as a broken shard of glass, wasn't there for the sights, though.  Tonight, she was there for the sound â€“ or rather, the *lack* of it.

Setting:  The grimy, neon-lit back alleys and shadowy side streets of  New Zenith City, a sprawling metropolis built on the promise of progress and shadowed by whispers of corruption.  The year is 1947.  The city is a labyrinth of steel and brick, where towering skyscrapers scrape the bruised clouds and hidden courtyards breathe a clandestine life of their own.  The air, thick with the exhaust fumes of the era's burgeoning automobiles and the scent of cheap coffee and desperation, hangs heavy and oppressive.
