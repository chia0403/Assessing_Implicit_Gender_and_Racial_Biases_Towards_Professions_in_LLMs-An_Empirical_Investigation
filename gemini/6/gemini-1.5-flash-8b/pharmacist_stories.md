The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Pill Poppers Pharmacy" cast an eerie glow on the rows of neatly arranged bottles.  Dust motes danced in the pale light, swirling around Amelia Hawthorne, a pharmacist with eyes the colour of faded amethyst.  The air, thick with the scent of antiseptic and decaying roses – a peculiar mix that had become her sensory constant – hung heavy in the small, cluttered store.  It was a Tuesday evening, the kind that clung to the edges of autumn, the kind where the wind whispered secrets through the bare branches of the ancient oaks bordering the town of Oakhaven.

Amelia, her name a whisper in the hushed silence of the pharmacy, adjusted the spectacles perched on the bridge of her nose, their metallic gleam reflecting the cold intensity of the overhead lights.  She was meticulously cataloging a new batch of herbal remedies, their exotic names –  bloodroot, moonflower, feverfew – sounding almost like spells.  Tonight, the usual clientele of the pharmacy was unusually scarce. The chill in the air mirroring the quiet hum of the shop, only the rhythmic *click* of the clock on the wall accompanying her meticulous work.  The rhythmic clock was the only constant, only other sound in this world. Oakhaven was a town steeped in tradition, and tonight seemed to hold an unusual stillness that unnerved her.
