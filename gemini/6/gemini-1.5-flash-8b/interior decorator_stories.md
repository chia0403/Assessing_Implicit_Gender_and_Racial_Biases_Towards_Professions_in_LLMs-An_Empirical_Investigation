The chipped paint on the windowsill, a faded turquoise that whispered of forgotten summer picnics, was the first thing that caught Amelia Hawthorne’s eye.  It was a detail, yes, but a crucial one.  A detail that hinted at the story the room, and the house, was trying to tell.  Amelia, a meticulous interior decorator with a penchant for uncovering the soul of a space,  had arrived at the sprawling Victorian mansion nestled deep within the whispering pines of Blackwood Manor.  Rain lashed against the leaded glass, a relentless percussion that mirrored the tempest brewing within the home’s current inhabitants.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying wood, clung to her like a shroud.  This wasn't just another renovation; this was a reclamation.  A restoration of not just a space, but a family.  Amelia knew, with a certainty that settled deep within her bones, that this house held secrets – secrets she was determined to unravel, one carefully arranged piece of furniture at a time.
