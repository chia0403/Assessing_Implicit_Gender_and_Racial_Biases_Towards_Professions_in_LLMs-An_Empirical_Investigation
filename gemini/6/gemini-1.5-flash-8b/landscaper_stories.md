The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's floral print scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks like a thousand tiny needles.  Dust motes, stirred up by the recent, relentless gale, danced in the pale, winter sun filtering through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks that guarded the sprawling estate of Lord Ashworth.  Amelia, a landscaper with a meticulous eye and a spirit as resilient as the heather that bloomed stubbornly in the Highlands, adjusted her worn leather satchel.  This was no ordinary job.  Lord Ashworth's gardens, renowned throughout the countryside for their breathtaking beauty, had fallen into disrepair.  The recent storm had ravaged the carefully cultivated topiary, snapping branches like twigs.  The once-pristine lawns were now a patchwork of mud and ripped grass.  Amelia, known less for her bravado and more for her quiet determination, was charged with restoring the garden to its former glory.  She knew this job would test her skill and stamina, demanding an almost unnatural patience in the face of the unrelenting elements.  The estate itself felt steeped in history, each cobbled path and weathered stone whispering tales of centuries past.  Her task, however, was not merely to rebuild the garden but to uncover the secrets hidden within its overgrown heart.
