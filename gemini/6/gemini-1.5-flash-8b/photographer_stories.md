The biting November wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks like a thousand tiny needles.  Above, the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks at Blackwood Manor clawed at a bruised, pewter sky.  Amelia, a photographer known for her intimate portraits of the human condition, felt a familiar tremor of anticipation, a thrill that mixed with the chill.  This was it.  The Blackwood family portrait.

Setting:

Blackwood Manor, a sprawling, gothic mansion perched atop a windswept hill overlooking the misty valley.  Its stone walls, weathered and shadowed, seemed to absorb the light, whispering tales of generations past.  Ivy clawed at the decaying brickwork, and the air itself seemed heavy with unspoken secrets.  Inside, the grand hall, once a beacon of warmth and laughter, was now draped in a somber atmosphere.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom, illuminating a room filled with the ghosts of long-gone gatherings.  The portraits, faded and cracked, hung like silent witnesses on the walls, each one a fleeting glimpse into a history Amelia was now tasked to capture.  The Blackwood family, known for their wealth and eccentricity, were a complex subject, their stories interwoven with the manorâ€™s very fabric.
