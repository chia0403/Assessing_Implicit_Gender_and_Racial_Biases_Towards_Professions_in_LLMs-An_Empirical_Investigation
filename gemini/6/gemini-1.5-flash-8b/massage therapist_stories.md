The rhythmic thrum of the vibrating massage table vibrated through Elara Nightingale's fingertips, a counterpoint to the soft, almost imperceptible sobs escaping Amelia’s lips.  Elara, her name a whisper of ethereal beauty, pressed deeper into the knotted muscles of Amelia’s back, a silent promise of solace.  The air in the small, dimly lit room, tucked away on a side street in the bustling heart of New London, was thick with the scent of lavender and something subtly metallic, like old pennies.  Antique posters, depicting scenes of exotic far-off lands, hung on the walls, their faded colours mingling with the muted glow of the single overhead bulb.  Dust motes danced in the filtered light, painting ethereal patterns across the worn wooden floorboards.  Outside, the city thrummed with a life that Elara, in this sanctuary of touch and quiet, momentarily forgot.  This was her haven, her temple, the place where stories were whispered through the language of muscles and sighs.
