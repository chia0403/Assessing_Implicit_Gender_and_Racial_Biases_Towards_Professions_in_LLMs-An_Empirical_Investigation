The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow over Amelia Nightingale, illuminating the grime-coated countertop and the chipped porcelain mug in her hands.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless percussion that echoed the frantic rhythm of her own heartbeat.  The air hung thick with the smell of stale beer and something vaguely floral, likely the wilting bouquet propped precariously on a nearby table.  Amelia, a server at The Rusty Mug for the past three years, wished the rain would just stop.  Not just for the sake of the noise, but because the incessant drumming made her head pound, and the pounding in her head felt a lot like the pounding in her chest. Tonight, everything felt wrong.  Tonight, the clinking of glasses and the muffled conversations felt like a cacophony of accusations.
