## Story Opening:

The sun, a molten coin sinking into the horizon, painted the Wyoming sky in hues of blood orange and bruised purple. Dust, kicked up by the day’s unrelenting wind, swirled around Jedediah Ezekiel Thornton's worn boots as he stood on the porch of his farmhouse, squinting at the approaching figure. It was Sheriff Brody, his truck bouncing along the rutted dirt track like a bucking bronco. Jedediah already knew, with a bone-deep certainty that settled in his stomach like lead, that the man wasn't bringing good news. The bad kind of news always seemed to arrive with the setting sun, whispering on the wind, lingering in the long, lonely shadows that stretched across the high desert plains.

## Setting:

**Thornton Ranch, Wyoming, 1938:**

The ranch itself was a study in resilience, clinging to the unforgiving landscape like a limpet to a rock. The farmhouse, a two-story structure built of rough-hewn timber, bore the brunt of decades of harsh weather. Faded paint peeled from its siding, revealing the greyed wood beneath, and the porch sagged slightly to one side, a testament to the relentless Wyoming winds.

A weathered barn, larger than the house, stood a short distance away, its corrugated iron roof glinting in the fading light. Fences, built of rough-hewn timber and rusted barbed wire, stretched across the vast plains, defining the boundaries of Jedediah’s hard-won claim. The land itself was a mix of sagebrush, scrub grass, and rocky outcroppings, a beautiful but unforgiving expanse that demanded respect and offered little in return. The air, even at dusk, held the dry, crackling scent of sage and the faint, metallic tang of dust. The only sounds were the mournful howl of the wind and the distant, rhythmic calls of coyotes, a symphony of solitude that defined life on the high plains.
