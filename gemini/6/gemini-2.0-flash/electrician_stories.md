The humid Louisiana air hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine and something vaguely metallic. It clung to Earl “Sparky” Dubois like a second skin, making the sweat trickle down his back under his worn Carhartt work shirt. Sparky cursed softly, the humid air doing its best to undo his meticulous wiring job in Mrs. Thibodeaux's old Victorian mansion.

The house itself, "Belle Reve" as a peeling, ornate sign proclaimed, was a faded beauty. Once a plantation manor, it now stood stubbornly on the banks of the bayou, its white paint cracked and peeling like sunburnt skin. Spanish moss draped from its gnarled oaks, casting long, dancing shadows that played tricks on the eyes. The porch sagged, a single, weathered rocking chair creaking forlornly in the slight breeze. Inside, the air was stifling, a mix of dust, mildew, and the faint, lingering perfume of generations past.

Earl Dubois had been called in to fix a faulty breaker, a simple job that had quickly spiraled into a rewiring nightmare. Mrs. Thibodeaux, a sweet but somewhat scatterbrained widow, had apparently decided to "modernize" the house herself, resulting in a chaotic jumble of wires, mismatched voltages, and enough potential fire hazards to make even a seasoned electrician like Sparky want to run screaming.

He was kneeling in the dimly lit parlor, surrounded by a tangled mess of wires that looked like Medusa's hairdo, his forehead beaded with perspiration. He straightened up, his knees cracking in protest, and ran a calloused hand through his thinning, sandy hair. "This," he muttered to himself, "is going to be a long week."
