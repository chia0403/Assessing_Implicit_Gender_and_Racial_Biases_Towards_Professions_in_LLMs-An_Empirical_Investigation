The persistent drizzle, more clinging mist than actual rain, had settled over Cambridge like a damp shroud. Professor Eleanor Ainsworth, her tweed jacket smelling faintly of old parchment and pipe tobacco (a habit she picked up long after her pipe-smoking grandfather passed), hunched deeper into her coat as she navigated the cobbled path towards Pembroke College. It was a Tuesday, and the damp chill had leeched the usual vibrant academic energy from the air. Even the students, usually buzzing with lectures and late-night study sessions, seemed subdued, their laughter muffled by the pervasive gloom.

Eleanor, a specialist in Medieval English Literature and a self-proclaimed expert on the lesser-known works of Geoffrey Chaucer, rarely minded the weather. She found a certain melancholic beauty in it, a resonance with the somber tones of the literature she loved. But today, even the dampness felt oppressive, mirroring a disquiet that had been brewing within her for weeks. The ancient stones of Pembroke, usually a source of comfort and inspiration, felt cold and unwelcoming. She had a feeling today's lecture on "The Complaint of Mars" would be a particularly challenging one. The text, with its themes of betrayal and cosmic disharmony, felt unnervingly relevant to something she couldn't quite put her finger on, a subtle but persistent tremor in the otherwise stable foundations of her ordered academic life.
