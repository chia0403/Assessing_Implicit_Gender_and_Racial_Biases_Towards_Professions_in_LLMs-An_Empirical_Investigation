The pre-dawn chill bit through Eustace Theodore Finch's thin, faded uniform as he unlocked the heavy, oak doors of the Grand Majestic Theatre. The air inside, usually thick with the lingering scent of perfume and anticipation, hung stale and heavy with the quiet exhaustion of the night. A single, bare work light buzzed overhead, casting a harsh, unforgiving glow across the plush, crimson carpeting and the rows of velvet seats, empty now save for a scattering of crumpled programs and discarded candy wrappers.

Eustace, a man whose sixty-odd years had etched deep lines into his kind face, shuffled in, the weight of his cleaning supplies pulling at his shoulders. The Grand Majestic was his responsibility, his silent charge. From the soaring gilded ceiling, adorned with cherubs frozen in mid-flight, to the depths of the orchestra pit, smelling faintly of rosin and regret, he knew every inch. Heâ€™d polished the brass railings until they gleamed like gold, vacuumed the crimson carpeting until it vibrated with color, and scrubbed the marble restrooms until they shone brighter than any star on the stage. 

He was more than just a janitor, he thought, as he sighed and started prepping his cleaning supplies. He was a custodian, a guardian, a silent witness to the magic that unfolded within these walls. He was Eustace Theodore Finch, and this theatre, in its quiet, pre-dawn solitude, was his kingdom.
