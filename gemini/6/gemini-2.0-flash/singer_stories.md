## Story Opening:

The air in the smoky club hung thick with anticipation, a nervous humidity that mirrored the knot in Seraphina Bellweather's stomach. Tiny rivulets of sweat traced paths down her back, clinging uncomfortably to the satin of her vintage crimson gown. She could feel the weight of the spotlight on her, even before it pierced the darkness, illuminating her like a trapped firefly. Tonight was different. Tonight wasn't just another Tuesday night at The Velvet Curtain. Tonight was her audition.

## Setting:

The Velvet Curtain, a legendary jazz club nestled deep within the heart of New Orleans' French Quarter, was a labyrinth of velvet drapes, dimly lit corners, and whispered secrets. Decades of spilled liquor and smoky performances had stained the walls a deep, almost bruised purple. The stage, a raised platform draped in black velvet, felt both intimate and exposed. The low, throaty murmur of conversations mingled with the clinking of glasses and the soft hum of the house band, creating a buzzing undercurrent of energy that both invigorated and threatened to overwhelm. It was a place where fortunes were made and broken, where dreams blossomed and withered under the gaze of discerning eyes. A place where Seraphina knew, deep in her heart, her future would be decided.
