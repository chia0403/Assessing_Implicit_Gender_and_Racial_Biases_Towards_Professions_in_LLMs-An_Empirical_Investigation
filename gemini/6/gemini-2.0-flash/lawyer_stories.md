The relentless hum of the fluorescent lights in the courthouse lobby was a lullaby to Amelia Stone. She'd practically grown up within these sterile, beige walls, her tiny hand tucked into her father's as he strode confidently towards another case, another fight. Now, twenty years later, it was her turn. Amelia Stone, Esquire, she reminded herself, smoothing down the crisp skirt of her navy suit.

The setting was the sprawling Miami-Dade County Courthouse, a labyrinth of corridors and courtrooms pulsing with the nervous energy of litigants, the measured pronouncements of judges, and the rustling whispers of courtroom staff. Outside, the sun would be beating down on the pastel-colored art deco buildings and lush palm trees of South Beach, but inside, the air was perpetually chilled, a constant reminder that justice, or at least the pursuit of it, was a serious business.

Today, Amelia wasn't battling a corporate giant or a hardened criminal. Today, she was representing Mrs. Rodriguez in a bitter custody battle, a case that reeked of heartbreak and betrayed promises. As she checked her reflection in the polished brass of the courtroom doors, Amelia Steel, Esquire, steeled herself for the fight ahead. She was ready to fight, she was ready to win.
