Okay, here's a story opening and setting with the full name of the main character, a nutritionist:

**Story Opening & Setting:**

The aroma of toasted sesame and simmering ginger threatened to overwhelm the sterile smell of the clinic. Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Hawthorne wrinkled her nose, a habit ingrained from years of trying to discern hidden ingredients and artificial flavors. She loved the vibrant food stalls that lined the narrow alley outside her office window, a testament to the stubborn vitality of the community she served, but today, the smell was just another reminder of the mountain of work piling up on her desk.

Ellie glanced at the clock. 8:58 AM. Two minutes until Mrs. Rodriguez, a lovely but hopelessly devoted disciple of the latest fad diet, was due. Ellie sighed, pushing aside a stack of patient files and a half-eaten apple (organic Gala, naturally). Maybe today, she could finally convince Mrs. Rodriguez that cleansing with charcoal lemonade wasnâ€™t the key to a longer life.

The setting was **the Hawthorne Wellness Clinic, a small, unassuming space tucked away on a side street in the vibrant, multi-cultural neighborhood of Little Saigon in Seattle, Washington.** Sunlight, diffused by the perpetually overcast sky, streamed in through the window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. The clinic was a cozy, if slightly cramped, affair. The walls were painted a calming shade of sage green, and adorned with framed prints of fruits and vegetables. A comfortable, if slightly worn, armchair sat in the corner, and a small bookshelf held a collection of cookbooks, nutrition guides, and pamphlets on healthy living. Ellie had tried to create a welcoming atmosphere, a haven from the confusing and often contradictory information swirling around the world of diet and nutrition. The clash of the calming interior with the vibrant, tempting smells of Little Saigon outside was a constant reminder of the challenges her patients faced every day.
