## Story Opening:

The scent of sawdust and stale cigarettes hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Elias Thorne. He coughed, adjusting the paisley scarf draped loosely around his neck. It did little to ward off the chill seeping into his bones from the uninsulated walls of the old Rialto Theatre. Outside, a blustery November wind howled, rattling the boarded-up windows and whispering forgotten melodies through the cracks. Inside, Elias surveyed the cavernous space with a mix of trepidation and exhilaration. Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light filtering through a broken panel in the roof, illuminating the peeling paint and the tattered velvet curtains, monuments to a bygone era. He inhaled deeply, the scent triggering a flood of memories - laughter, applause, the hushed anticipation of a captivated audience. All ghosts now.

**Setting:**

The story begins in the abandoned Rialto Theatre in the forgotten seaside town of Port Blossom, Maine. Once a thriving hub for vaudeville acts and touring plays, the Rialto has stood derelict for nearly thirty years, its glory faded into a ghostly echo. The town itself mirrors the theater's decline, the fishing industry having withered and the younger generation seeking opportunities elsewhere. The overall atmosphere is one of melancholy and decay, punctuated by moments of stark, natural beauty - the crashing waves against the jagged coastline, the vibrant sunsets that paint the sky in hues of orange and purple. Port Blossom clings to its past, a past that Elias Thorne is desperately trying to resurrect, one tattered curtain and creaky floorboard at a time.
