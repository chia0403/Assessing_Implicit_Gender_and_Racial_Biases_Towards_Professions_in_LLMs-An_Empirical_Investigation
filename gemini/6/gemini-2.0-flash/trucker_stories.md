## Story Opening:

The rhythmic thump of the engine was Ezekiel "Zeke" Daniels' lullaby, the white lines of I-80 his hypnotic guide. Tonight, however, the lullaby was a little off-key, a subtle tremor humming through the steering wheel that had Zeke tightening his grip, his knuckles bone-white under the dim glow of the dashboard. He glanced at the fuel gauge, needle steady just above the halfway mark. No, not the truck. This was a different kind of unease, a prickly feeling under his skin he hadn't shaken since leaving Denver. Maybe it was just the caffeine finally wearing off, or maybe… maybe it was the radio.

He'd tried flipping through stations, searching for the comforting drawl of a late-night talk show or the twang of country music, anything to fill the vast, lonely space inside the cab. But all he found was static, a crackling void that seemed to amplify the silence instead of breaking it. He reached out, snapped the radio off, and the sudden quiet was almost deafening. He was alone. Utterly, terrifyingly alone, on a ribbon of asphalt snaking its way through the heart of nowhere. And he had a delivery to make.

## Setting:

The year is 1988. Ezekiel "Zeke" Daniels, a burly man in his late fifties with a salt-and-pepper beard that could rival a mountain goat’s, is driving his Kenworth W900, nicknamed "The Wanderer," through the desolate landscape of southwestern Wyoming. The sky is a vast, ink-black canvas sprinkled with a million pinprick stars, sharp and cold in the thin air. The moon is a sliver, offering little illumination to the stark, rolling hills that stretch out on either side of the highway. Patches of sagebrush cling to the dry earth, their scent a faint, earthy perfume that drifts into the cab on the occasional gust of wind. The temperature is plummeting towards freezing, and the air crackles with a dry, biting chill. He's miles from the nearest town, a blink-and-you'll-miss-it place called Lost Creek, and the only other signs of civilization are the occasional flickering lights of distant oil rigs, like lonely sentinels guarding the secrets of the earth.
