The low thrum of the fluorescent lights was the only sound competing with the infernal scratching emanating from behind the wall. Dr. Alistair Quinton Featherstonehaugh, DDS, tapped his pen against the faded beige countertop, the rhythmic click a counterpoint to the frantic squeaking now joining the scratching. He sighed, the sound barely audible over the cacophony.

His practice, "Featherstonehaugh Family Dentistry: Making Smiles Brighter Since 1978," was located in a converted Victorian house on Elm Street, a street that hadn't seen an elm tree since 1952. The house had seen better days, the paint peeling like sunburnt skin, and the once grand porch now slumped precariously to one side. Inside, Alistair had tried to maintain a veneer of respectability, but the floral wallpaper, chosen by his late wife, was fading, and the magazines in the waiting room were hopelessly outdated, featuring celebrities who had long since transitioned from red carpets to real estate ventures.

He looked around his tiny office, the walls lined with framed diplomas and slightly unsettling close-up photographs of perfectly aligned teeth. The single window offered a depressing view of the alley, punctuated by overflowing dumpsters and the occasional scurrying rat â€“ a species with whom Alistair felt an increasingly unwelcome kinship. It was Tuesday, appointment number four of the day was late, and he was fairly certain he could smell rodent urine wafting in from behind the wallpaper. This was, he thought with a grimace, another Tuesday in paradise.
