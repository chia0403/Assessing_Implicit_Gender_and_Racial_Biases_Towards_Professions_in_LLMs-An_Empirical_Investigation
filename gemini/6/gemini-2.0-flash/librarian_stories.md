The scent of old paper and chamomile tea, a potent and comforting combination unique to the Hawthorne Public Library, clung to Eleanor Ainsworth like a familiar friend. Sunlight, filtered through the towering oak outside the north-facing window, cast dancing motes of light across the polished surface of the circulation desk. Eleanor, Head Librarian and protector of countless stories, adjusted her spectacles, the chain jingling softly against the faded floral print of her dress. It was a Tuesday, typically a quiet day, with only Mrs. Gable, a woman known for her fervent devotion to romance novels and equally fervent criticisms of the libraryâ€™s WiFi, holding court in the corner armchair. The clock above the doorway, a brass monstrosity bequeathed by a long-dead alderman, ticked with a steady, almost defiant rhythm. Eleanor, however, felt an unsettling stillness beneath the usual tranquility, a prickling sensation that suggested the day would be anything but ordinary. Hawthorne, Massachusetts, a town steeped in history and hidden secrets, often yielded more than just overdue books.
