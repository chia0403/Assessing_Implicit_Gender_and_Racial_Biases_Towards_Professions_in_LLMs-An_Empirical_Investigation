The fluorescent lights of Krill & Sons Accounting hummed a monotonous tune, a tune that reverberated within Harold Frederick Bingley’s very bones. He hated the hum. It was a constant, nagging reminder that he was still here, still hunched over spreadsheets filled with numbers that blurred into an endless, unreadable sea. Outside, the November rain lashed against the grimy windows, mirroring the tempest brewing inside him.

Harold, at the age of 37, was perfectly, excruciatingly ordinary. He lived in a small, semi-detached house in the suburbs of Slough, drove a sensible Ford Focus, and his life was predictable to a fault. He even ate a sandwich with ham and Swiss cheese on rye bread for lunch, *every single day*. It was, he knew, a deeply boring existence.

Krill & Sons Accounting, established in 1948, was everything Harold’s life embodied: beige, unremarkable, and suffocatingly reliable. The building itself was a squat, brick monstrosity located on a particularly uninspiring stretch of the Slough Trading Estate, nestled between a distribution centre for garden gnomes and a slightly disreputable-looking tyre depot. The interior was no better. Brown carpet, beige walls, and a lingering smell of stale coffee permeated everything. Even the air seemed to lack ambition.

Harold sighed, pushing his glasses further up his nose. The tax deadline was looming, and his in-tray overflowed with receipts, invoices, and declarations that seemed determined to mock his already fragile sanity. He longed for something, anything, to break the suffocating monotony. He longed, quite desperately, for adventure.
