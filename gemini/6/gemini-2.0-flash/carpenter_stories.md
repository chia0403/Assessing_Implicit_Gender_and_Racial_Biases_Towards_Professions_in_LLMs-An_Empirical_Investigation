The damp chill of a November morning seeped through the gaps in the corrugated iron roof of Elias Thatcher's workshop, clinging to the sawdust-laden air like a persistent ghost. He could see his breath puffing out in front of him as he traced the grain of the cherrywood with a roughened thumb. The workshop, affectionately (and somewhat ironically) nicknamed "The Cathedral" by the other residents of Havenwood, Maine, was far from holy. Tools hung haphazardly from mismatched nails hammered into exposed beams. Plans, sketches, and half-finished projects littered every available surface, a chaotic testament to Elias’s restless mind. Outside, the coastal town of Havenwood was slowly waking. The mournful clang of the buoy bell, a constant, rhythmic pulse, echoed across the harbor, mingling with the distant rumble of a lobster boat’s engine. Today, Elias was supposed to be carving a new sign for the Salty Crab Tavern, a commission he desperately needed to pay his ever-mounting bills. But the cherrywood, a salvaged piece from a fallen tree deep in the Havenwood forest, had other ideas. It whispered of smoother curves, of a project far more ambitious than a simple tavern sign, a project that threatened to consume him entirely.
