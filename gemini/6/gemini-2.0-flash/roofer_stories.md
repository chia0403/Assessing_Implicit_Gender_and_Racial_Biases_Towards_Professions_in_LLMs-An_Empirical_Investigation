The late afternoon sun, a molten orange coin sinking behind the jagged cityscape, felt less like a blessing and more like a brand on Arthur Theodore Carmichael’s sweat-soaked back. He squinted, the gritty film of asphalt dust clinging to his eyelashes, and braced himself against the familiar sway of the old Victorian roof. This was it, the last stretch. Just a few more shingles, a final tuck of the flashing, and he could finally escape the blistering heat and the chorus of jackhammers echoing from the construction site a block over.

Arthur hated Fridays. It was like the city, weary from the week, exhaled its frustrations in a cacophony of noise and impatience. Even the pigeons, usually indifferent to his presence, seemed more aggressive, cooing and flapping incessantly, their beady eyes following his every move. He could feel the heat radiating off the dark slate beneath his boots, and the faint, sickly-sweet smell of tar hung heavy in the air.

The setting was the historic neighborhood of Brookside, Kansas City. A charming patchwork of brick streets and Queen Anne mansions, it was a roofer's paradise (and a homeowner's nightmare). Years of harsh Midwestern weather had taken their toll on these grand old homes, leaving Arthur with a steady stream of repair work and a grudging respect for the architecture that stubbornly refused to crumble completely. This particular house, perched high on a corner lot, was a three-story beauty, adorned with gingerbread trim and a turret that always made Arthur nervous to climb. He’d been working on it for the past three weeks, replacing damaged shingles and battling the occasional stubborn squirrel who seemed to think the gutters were his personal playground. Now, finally, the end was in sight.
