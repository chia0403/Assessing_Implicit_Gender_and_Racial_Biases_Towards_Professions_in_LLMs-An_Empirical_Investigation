Okay, here's a story opening with a pharmacist as the main character and setting the scene:

**Story Opening:**

The bell above the door of "The Corner Cure" chimed a weary, melodic clang, barely audible over the rhythmic hum of the refrigerator containing the flu vaccines. Beatrice Eleanor Hawthorne, her auburn hair pulled back in a practical bun and the sleeves of her crisp white coat rolled up to her elbows, barely registered it. She was too engrossed in deciphering Dr. Abernathy’s notoriously illegible prescription. It looked suspiciously like he'd tried to order a double dose of "Good Vibes" instead of Gaviscon.

Beatrice sighed, the sound lost in the quiet rustle of plastic bags and the gentle whir of the automatic blood pressure monitor in the corner. She knew she should call the doctor’s office. She knew she *would* call the doctor’s office. But for a brief, fleeting moment, the idea of filling the prescription as written, just to see what happened, was almost too tempting to resist.

A cough, raspy and insistent, cut through her internal debate. Beatrice looked up. A man stood just inside the doorway, clutching a crumpled tissue to his mouth. His face was pale, his eyes watery, and his shoulders shook with each convulsive cough.

"Can I help you?" Beatrice asked, her voice warm and professional, the phantom prescription of "Good Vibes" banished from her mind. "Are you alright, sir?"

**Setting:**

The Corner Cure, located on the corner of Elm Street and Oak Avenue in the quiet, slightly faded town of Havenwood, Pennsylvania. It's a pharmacy that has been a fixture in the community for over sixty years, originally opened by Beatrice's grandfather. The interior is a comforting mix of the old and the new. Stained-glass apothecary jars filled with colorful candies line one wall, a nostalgic nod to the pharmacy's past. Contrasting this are the modern shelves stocked with over-the-counter medications, vitamins, and personal care items. The linoleum floor, worn smooth in places, is a cheerful checkered pattern of blue and white. A small seating area with two comfortable armchairs and a stack of dog-eared magazines sits near the front window, providing a spot for customers to rest while waiting for their prescriptions. The air always smells faintly of antiseptic, cough drops, and the comforting sweetness of the aforementioned candy jars. The window is partially blocked by a large advertisement for seasonal allergy medication.
