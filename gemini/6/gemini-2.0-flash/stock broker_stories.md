The migraine hammered at the back of Arthur Finch's skull like a persistent woodpecker. He squinted against the harsh glare emanating from the six monitor screens surrounding his desk, each a chaotic collage of fluctuating numbers and flashing red and green arrows. Arthur, thirty-eight, a veteran stock broker at the venerable firm of Hawthorne & Wainwright, Massapequa Branch, felt every year of his age, and then some. The air in the open-plan trading floor vibrated with the frenetic energy of a beehive kicked over, the drone of shouted orders and the relentless tap-tap-tap of keyboards a constant, maddening chorus.

Hawthorne & Wainwright, nestled in the heart of Massapequa Park, Long Island, was not exactly Wall Street. It was a smaller, more regional affair, catering to the suburban anxieties and aspirations of dentists, deli owners, and retired postal workers, all dreaming of early retirement and a life of leisure. The office itself was a testament to faded glory. The carpeting, a once-luxurious navy blue, was worn thin in the high-traffic areas. The mahogany veneer of the desks was scratched and peeling. A pervasive smell of stale coffee and nervous sweat clung to the air, a testament to the high-stakes, high-pressure environment.

Arthur, however, usually thrived in this chaos. He was a shark in a small pond, known for his sharp instincts and a preternatural ability to sniff out a winning stock. But today, the market felt off, volatile and unpredictable, and the insistent throbbing in his head threatened to derail his entire day, and perhaps even his career. Today, Arthur Finch felt like he was drowning.
