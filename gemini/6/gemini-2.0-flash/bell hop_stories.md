Okay, here's a story opening and setting:

**Opening:**

The insistent, frantic ringing ripped Harold Percival Finch from a surprisingly vivid dream where he was tap-dancing on a giant pile of perfectly folded towels. Groaning, Harold blinked against the dim pre-dawn light filtering through the dusty curtains of his tiny room above the hotel kitchen. He knew that ring. That was the front desk, specifically Mr. Abernathy, the night manager, who only called Harold this early if something was disastrously wrong, or if a truly colossal tip was involved. Most mornings, disastrously wrong won.

He slapped at his alarm clock – 4:47 AM – and wrestled himself into his bellhop uniform, the crimson piping a stark contrast to the faded blue. As he jammed his cap onto his head, the bell rang again, each ring a tiny hammer blow against his already throbbing temples. Whatever waited downstairs wasn’t going to wait any longer.

**Setting:**

The story takes place in the **Grand Majestic Hotel** in the (fictional) resort town of **Seabrook, Maine**. Seabrook, once a bustling whaling port, now relies almost entirely on tourism. The Grand Majestic, built in the late 19th century, is a relic of a bygone era. It attempts to maintain an air of faded grandeur, with its ornate lobby, creaky wooden floors, and portraits of stern-faced whaling captains lining the hallways.

While the hotel boasts luxurious suites and boasts ocean views, the reality is one of peeling wallpaper, temperamental plumbing, and a persistent smell of mildew. The Grand Majestic is a place where secrets linger in the dust motes dancing in the sunbeams, and where the whispers of past guests echo faintly in the empty corridors.

Harold's world within the Grand Majestic is largely confined to the front lobby, the elevators, and the labyrinthine service corridors that connect the hotel's heart to its humbler parts like the staff quarters, kitchen, and linen room. His life is a constant whirl of luggage carts, demanding guests, and the unspoken understanding that he's perpetually "on stage," always ready to offer a smile and a helping hand, even when he'd rather be anywhere else.
