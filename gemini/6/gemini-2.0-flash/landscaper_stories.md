## Story Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

The stench hit Arthur Penhaligon like a punch to the gut, a noxious blend of rotting lilies and stagnant water. He pulled his bandana higher over his nose, the familiar floral print doing little to mask the offending odor. Usually, Arthur found a peculiar solace in the smell of the earth, the sharp tang of freshly cut grass, the sweet perfume of honeysuckle blooming in the evening. Today, however, nature was actively plotting against him.

He hoisted his heavy backpack sprayer, the familiar weight a small comfort in this olfactory assault, and trudged deeper into the overgrown jungle that Mrs. Abernathy generously referred to as her garden. "Just a little tidying up, Mr. Penhaligon," she'd chirped, her bird-like voice belying the Herculean task that lay before him. Arthur sighed, the sound muffled by the bandana, and adjusted his worn leather gloves. He had a feeling this was going to be a long, and very smelly, day.

**Setting:**

The setting is the sprawling, neglected estate of Elderwood Manor, located on the outskirts of the small, affluent town of Havenwood, Connecticut. The manor itself is a gothic revival monstrosity, all dark stone and towering turrets, shrouded in ivy and perpetually casting long, ominous shadows. The once meticulously manicured gardens are now a riot of uncontrolled growth. Weeds choke the rose bushes, vines engulf statuary, and the formal lawns have reverted to a wild, undulating meadow dotted with rogue wildflowers. A crumbling fountain, choked with algae, sits at the center of what was once a pristine circular drive. The air is thick with humidity, the buzzing of insects, and the aforementioned unpleasant aroma emanating from the forgotten corners of the overgrown landscape. It's late June, the sun beating down with a relentless intensity that steams the already saturated ground.
