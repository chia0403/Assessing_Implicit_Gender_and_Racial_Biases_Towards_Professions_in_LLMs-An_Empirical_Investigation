**Setting:** The fluorescent lights of the "Stat Labs Express" mobile phlebotomy van hummed with a relentless, almost nervous energy. Parked outside the sprawling, gothic-looking Crestwood Manor, a notorious assisted living facility on the outskirts of Oakhaven, Pennsylvania, the van vibrated slightly with the low rumble of the generator. Inside, the sterile smell of alcohol swabs mixed with the faintly cloying scent of the vanilla air freshener, a desperate attempt to mask the anxieties clinging to the air. Outside, the sprawling grounds of Crestwood, normally manicured and picturesque, were now shrouded in the early morning mist, giving the entire estate a haunted, spectral quality.

**Story Opening:**

"Another Monday, another potential needle stick," murmured Genevieve Marie Moreau, adjusting the chin strap of her N95 mask. The humid air inside the van was already starting to fog up her glasses, a constant battle she seemed to lose every single day. Her gloved hands meticulously laid out her supplies â€“ a butterfly needle, vacutainer tubes, a tourniquet, antiseptic wipes, and a small, biohazard-labeled sharps container. Crestwood Manor was always a challenge. The residents were either incredibly sweet and cooperative, or fiercely resistant to any intrusion, their veins like shy earthworms hiding beneath layers of aged, paper-thin skin. And then, of course, there was Mrs. Hawthorne, whose blood always seemed to clot the instant the needle entered her arm. Genevieve sighed, a puff of warm air escaping her mask. Today, her first appointment was in Room 212: Mr. Silas Blackwood. She hadn't looked him up beforehand, deliberately trying to approach each patient without preconceived notions. But the name...the name sounded like something from a Victorian gothic novel, a perfect fit for the brooding atmosphere of Crestwood Manor. With a final deep breath, Genevieve grabbed her clipboard and stepped out of the van and into the misty dawn, ready to face whatever the morning held.
