Okay, here's a story opening and setting that fits your request:

**Story Opening:**

The chipped ceramic mug warmed Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne’s hands, a small comfort against the chill that seemed to permanently reside in her bones. She hated early mornings, even mornings as crisp and promising as this one threatened to be. Most of all, she hated early morning phone calls, and the insistent trill of her landline was currently sawing away at her already frayed nerves.

She eyed the phone with the suspicion usually reserved for her writers who insisted on using the word "ethereal" for anything that wasn't, you know, actually ethereal.

A deep breath. Better to rip the band-aid off, as they say. Amelia picked up the receiver, bracing herself for a rant, a deadline extension request, or worse, the news that someone had quit to “find themselves in Bali,” leaving her scrambling to find a replacement.

"Hawthorne," she barked, not bothering with a "good morning" or any other pleasantries. Her voice sounded like gravel, and she secretly enjoyed the effect.

The voice on the other end was not familiar, but it was not one she wanted to associate with in the slightest.

"Amelia Hawthorne?" it croaked. "My name is Mr. James, I believe that I have something that belongs to you..."

**Setting:**

The scene takes place in Amelia Hawthorne's apartment in the West Village of New York City. Her apartment is situated on the third floor of a brownstone building.

**Details:**

*   **Interior:** The apartment is small and cluttered. Bookshelves overflow with hardcovers and paperbacks, stacked precariously against each other. Manuscripts are piled on every available surface, alongside half-empty mugs of tea and crumpled drafts. The walls are painted a faded green and are adorned with framed book covers of authors Amelia has worked with.
*   **Lighting:** The room is bathed in the soft, diffused light of early morning filtering through the tall windows. Lamps with warm-toned bulbs provide additional illumination, creating a cozy, if somewhat chaotic, atmosphere.
*   **Furniture:** A worn-out armchair sits near the window, draped with a knitted blanket. A large, oak desk dominates one corner of the room, covered in stacks of paper and editing tools. A small, outdated kitchen is visible through an archway, its countertops similarly cluttered.

**Amelia Hawthorne:**
She is a 40-year-old book editor. Wears glasses, her brown hair is often pulled back in a messy bun, and her go-to outfit is a cardigan over a comfortable blouse and sensible pants. She has a sharp mind and an even sharper wit, honed by years of dealing with writers and the publishing industry. Underneath her cynical exterior, however, lies a deep love for stories and a genuine desire to help writers achieve their full potential.
