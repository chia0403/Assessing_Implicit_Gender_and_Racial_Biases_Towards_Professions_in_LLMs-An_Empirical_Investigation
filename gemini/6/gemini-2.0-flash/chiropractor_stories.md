## Story Opening:

The late afternoon sun, already tinged orange by the encroaching autumn, sliced through the dusty blinds of Dr. Elias Thorne's office. He watched the motes of dust dance in the golden light, a silent ballet he often used to distract himself from the anxieties churning in his gut. The metallic tang of ozone still lingered in the air from the last adjustment, a reminder of the physical force he exerted, a force that felt increasingly less effective. He was bone-weary, not just from the day's appointments, but from the heavier weight of unease that had settled on his shoulders in recent weeks. 

The bell above the door *dinged*, a cheerful sound that grated on his nerves. "Come in," Elias called out, forcing a smile onto his face as he turned from the window. He hoped, perhaps foolishly, that the next patient would be a simple case, a straightforward crick in the neck, not another knotted mess of stress and silent suffering he felt ill-equipped to unravel.
## Setting:

**Dr. Elias Thorne's Chiropractic Clinic** is located in a converted Victorian house in the historic district of Havenwood, Maine. The building, painted a fading, dignified grey, sits nestled between a quaint bookstore and a bakery that perpetually smells of cinnamon and maple. 

Inside, the clinic attempts to blend old-world charm with modern functionality. The waiting room boasts ornate, though slightly chipped, plasterwork, comfortable floral armchairs inherited from Elias' grandmother, and a towering philodendron that threatens to overtake a corner. Framed anatomical charts line the walls alongside landscapes painted by local artists. 

Elias' office itself is more utilitarian. A large, well-worn chiropractic table dominates the space, its leather cracked and softened by years of use. Sunlight streams in from a large bay window, illuminating the desk cluttered with patient files, textbooks, and half-empty mugs of herbal tea. A skeleton model, affectionately nicknamed "Bones," stands sentinel in the corner, occasionally sporting a silly hat left by a particularly whimsical patient. The air is a mixture of antiseptic, essential oils, and the lingering scent of Elias' favorite sandalwood incense. While the overall aesthetic is calming, there's a palpable sense of Elias' own weariness embedded in the space, a feeling that even the carefully chosen decor can't quite mask.
