## Story Opening:

The scent of crayon wax and vaguely-identifiable juice boxes hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume that usually calmed Miss Penelope Abigail Bloom. Today, however, it was doing nothing to soothe the knot tightening in her stomach. She surveyed her classroom, a riot of primary colors and painstakingly glued pasta art, and took a deep breath. Twenty-three pairs of bright, expectant eyes stared back at her, some picking at their noses, others gnawing on their sleeves, but all waiting for her lead. This was it. This was the day she had to explain to her five-year-olds why their favorite hamster, Mr. Nibbles, was no longer with them. Penelope clutched the small, tattered copy of "The Runaway Bunny" to her chest, hoping its gentle tale could somehow soften the blow.

## Setting:

The scene is set in the brightly-decorated kindergarten classroom of "Sunshine Sprouts Academy," a private preschool located in the quiet, tree-lined suburb of Meadowbrook. The classroom is a haven of learning and imagination. Alphabet charts line the walls, adorned with cut-out images of corresponding objects. Colorful rugs designate different learning areas: a reading nook filled with plush pillows and picture books, a block corner overflowing with wooden shapes, an art easel splattered with evidence of countless masterpieces, and a science station boasting a terrarium, a collection of rocks, and, until this morning, Mr. Nibbles' habitat. Sunlight streams through the large windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and casting a warm glow on the expectant faces of Penelope's students. The walls are covered with their artwork, a testament to their creativity and the vibrant, nurturing environment Penelope has cultivated.
