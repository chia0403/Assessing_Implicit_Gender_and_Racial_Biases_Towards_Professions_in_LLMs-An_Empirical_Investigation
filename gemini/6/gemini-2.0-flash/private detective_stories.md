## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, stinging even through the thick wool of Detective Isabella "Izzy" Rossi's coat. It was a late November night in Chicago, the kind that sunk deep into your bones and made you long for summer sunshine. The flickering neon sign of "The Blue Note" cast a garish glow on the slick, rain-washed streets of Lincoln Park, a beacon in the otherwise dimly lit neighborhood. Garbage cans overflowed, scattering newspaper scraps and discarded take-out containers across the pavement. The air was thick with the smell of exhaust fumes and stale beer, a potent cocktail that was uniquely Chicagoan.

**Story Opening:**

The ringing phone sliced through the relative quiet of Isabella Rossi's dimly lit office, a small, cluttered space above a dry cleaner on Fullerton Avenue. The answering machine clicked on, the recorded voice a monotone drone: "You've reached Rossi Investigations. Leave a message." Izzy, slumped in her swivel chair, nursing a lukewarm cup of coffee and staring at the rain-streaked window, considered letting it go. Another deadbeat client, probably. Another sob story about a lost cat or a cheating spouse. She was about to reach for the remote to crank up the jazz on the radio when the caller spoke, their voice raspy and urgent.

"Isabella Rossi? I need your help. It's... it's about my husband, Arthur Penhaligon. He's gone missing. And I think... I think someone might have taken him."

Izzy sighed, the cold settling deeper in her bones. Just when she thought she was out of the woods with the last case – a messy divorce involving a politician and a poodle – something new crawled out of the woodwork. Arthur Penhaligon. She didn't recognize the name. But the desperation in the woman's voice was enough to draw her in. Reluctantly, Isabella picked up the phone. "This is Izzy Rossi. Tell me everything."
