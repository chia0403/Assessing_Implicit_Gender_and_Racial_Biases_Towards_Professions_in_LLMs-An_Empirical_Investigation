## Story Opening:

The flickering fluorescent lights of the North Chicago Industrial Park seemed to hum in time with Arthur P. Higgins’ growing anxiety. He swiped a bead of sweat from his brow with the back of his tie – a crimson monstrosity his mother had gifted him last Christmas. He was already five minutes late, the traffic snaking off the interstate had been a nightmare, and his carefully rehearsed sales pitch felt like a jumbled mess of buzzwords and empty promises rattling around in his head.

He killed the engine of his aging Ford Taurus, the groan it emitted sounding suspiciously like a cry for help. He took a deep breath, adjusted his slightly-too-large glasses, and clutched his worn leather briefcase. This was it. Meeting with Mr. Jankowski, the notoriously stingy owner of Jankowski Bolt & Nut. Securing this contract would be the difference between making rent and eating ramen for the next month.

He just had to remember to smile, be confident, and for the love of all that was holy, not mention the time he accidentally called Mrs. Jankowski "Ma'am" last year.

## Setting:

The North Chicago Industrial Park, a sprawling, grey landscape punctuated by anonymous metal warehouses and the occasional sputtering smokestack, felt like the end of the earth. The buildings were uniformly drab, their facades only hinting at the industrial processes churning within. Jankowski Bolt & Nut was nestled in the heart of this desolate expanse, its signage faded and peeling, a testament to years of weathering and a lack of investment. A chain-link fence, topped with rusted barbed wire, enclosed the property, giving it the air of a forgotten prison rather than a thriving business. The air hung heavy with the scent of metal shavings and the low thrum of machinery, a constant reminder of the grit and grime that permeated every corner of the park. Inside, Arthur imagined, it would be just as bleak, just as unforgiving.
