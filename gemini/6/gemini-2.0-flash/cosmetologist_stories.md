Okay, here’s a story opening and setting featuring a cosmetologist:

**Setting:**

The humid, jasmine-scented air hung heavy over Savannah, Georgia. Spanish moss dripped from the ancient oaks lining Forsyth Park, casting long, dappled shadows that danced across the cobblestone streets. Boutique shops and art galleries were nestled alongside grand, faded mansions, creating an atmosphere that was both charming and steeped in history. At the edge of the historic district, tucked away on a quieter lane, sat “The Gilded Lily,” a small, but exquisitely decorated salon. Its window display boasted antique mirrors, delicate orchids, and framed images of classic Hollywood starlets, promising a touch of old-world glamour within.

**Story Opening:**

Eleanor Rose Devereux pressed her forehead against the cool glass of the salon window, the scent of honeysuckle and expensive hairspray doing little to soothe the knot forming in her stomach. Outside, a horse-drawn carriage clip-clopped slowly past, carrying a gaggle of giggling tourists. Inside, the air vibrated with the low hum of hair dryers and the lilting strains of Ella Fitzgerald. Eleanor could hear her assistant, Lily Mae, chattering away with Mrs. Henderson about the upcoming debutante ball. Everything felt…normal. But Eleanor's normal had fractured the day she received the letter.

Her fingers traced the swirling gilt lettering of the salon's name, a name she'd painstakingly chosen, a name that represented the dream she'd meticulously built over the past five years. Five years of early mornings, late nights, and countless gallons of hair dye. Five years of making women (and sometimes men) feel beautiful, confident, and ready to conquer the world, one perfectly coiffed strand at a time.

The bell above the door chimed, announcing the arrival of her ten o’clock appointment. Eleanor straightened, smoothed down her floral-print apron, and forced a smile to her lips. Another day, another perfectly imperfect face to transform. But today, the fear of what the letter contained threatened to unravel everything she'd so carefully created. Today, the gilded lily might just wilt.
