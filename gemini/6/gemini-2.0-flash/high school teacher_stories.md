The chipped, faded yellow paint of Ms. Eleanor Penelope Hawthorne's classroom walls seemed to hum a perpetual, low-frequency sigh of resignation. Room 214, affectionately nicknamed "The Dust Bowl" by her students, at Northwood High, a brick behemoth plunked down in the perpetually overcast town of Oakhaven, Oregon. It was a place where dreams, like the wilting fern on her windowsill, tended to wither rather than flourish. This particular Monday morning, the sigh was particularly audible, likely echoing Eleanor’s own internal monologue as she stared at the expectant, if disengaged, faces of her sophomore English class. The air hung thick with the aroma of stale coffee and teenage apathy, a potent and depressing blend. The rain outside hammered against the grimy windows, mirroring the drumming anxiety in Eleanor’s chest. Another week loomed, another mountain of essays to grade, another battle against the tide of Tik-Tok and apathy. It was going to be a long one.
