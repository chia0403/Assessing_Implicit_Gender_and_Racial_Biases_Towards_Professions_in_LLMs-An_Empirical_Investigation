## Story Opening & Setting

**Opening:**

The stench hit Elias Vance like a rogue wave the moment he cracked open the basement door. It was a multi-layered assault: sour milk gone bad, stale mildew, and something vaguely…reptilian. He pinched the bridge of his nose, bracing himself. "Alright, Bessie," he muttered to his trusty pipe wrench, its metal jaws gleaming in the dim light filtering down from the stairwell, "let's see what kind of monster lurks in the deep." Elias descended, each creak of the wooden steps a reluctant groan of warning.

**Setting:**

Elias Vance found himself in the bowels of the "Elderwood Manor," a sprawling, gothic behemoth perched precariously on a cliff overlooking the Pacific. Built in the 1920s by a reclusive shipping magnate with a penchant for gargoyles and mahogany, the manor was now a dilapidated bed-and-breakfast, desperately clinging to its faded grandeur. The basement, even more than the rest of the house, felt steeped in a forgotten era. Dusty cobwebs draped from exposed pipes like macabre garlands. Unidentifiable stains marred the concrete floor. The air hung thick and heavy, clinging to Elias like a damp shroud. A single, flickering bulb cast long, dancing shadows that seemed to writhe with a life of their own. This was not a place for the faint of heart, or for plumbers who preferred clean, well-lit spaces. But Elias Vance wasn’t one to back down from a challenge, especially when it came with a hefty paycheck and the promise of a decent mystery to unravel. He just hoped the mystery wasn't going to bite him.
