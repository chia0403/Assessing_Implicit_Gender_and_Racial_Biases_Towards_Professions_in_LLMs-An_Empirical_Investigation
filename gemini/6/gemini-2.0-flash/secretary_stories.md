The clatter of the aging Remington Rand typewriter, a relic from a bygone era Miss Mildred Abigail Plumtree affectionately nicknamed "Old Bess," was the soundtrack to her existence. It punctuated the silence of the antiquated office on the third floor of the Crumbly & Crumbles Construction Company, located in the less-than-glamorous industrial district of Grimsborough.

Grimsborough itself was a town perpetually shrouded in a grey drizzle, its skyline dominated by belching smokestacks and half-finished construction projects that Crumbly & Crumbles were, ironically, often responsible for. The office, a cramped space painted a particularly uninspired shade of beige, smelled perpetually of dust, stale coffee, and the faint, lingering scent of Mr. Crumbly's pipe tobacco. Sunlight, when it dared to break through the Grimsborough gloom, struggled to penetrate the grime-coated windows, casting long, melancholic shadows across Mildred's desk, a chaotic landscape of overflowing in-trays, half-eaten cheese sandwiches, and carefully stacked files labeled with increasingly cryptic abbreviations only she understood.
