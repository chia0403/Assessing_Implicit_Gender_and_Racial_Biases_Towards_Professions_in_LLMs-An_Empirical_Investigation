The stale coffee tasted like burnt rubber, a familiar comfort in the pre-dawn chill. Officer Detective Isabella “Izzy” Rossi swallowed it down, the gritty liquid doing little to warm the shiver that ran down her spine. Outside the squad room window, the relentless rain hammered against the grimy glass, mirroring the relentless drumming of anxiety in her chest. The sky, a bruised purple-gray, clung low and heavy over the city.

The setting was the **18th Precinct of the Brooklyn Police Department**, nestled in the heart of **Red Hook**. The precinct, a hulking brick building that had seen better days, stood defiant against the encroaching gentrification. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of stale cigarettes, disinfectant, and the unspoken stories of a thousand broken lives. Fluorescent lights hummed a weary tune overhead, casting a harsh, unflattering glow on the cluttered desks and tired faces. Around Izzy, the early birds were already starting to stir, paperwork rustling, phones ringing, and hushed conversations buzzing like angry bees. It was the dawn of another day in Red Hook, and another day wading knee-deep in the underbelly of the city. Izzy knew, with a certainty that settled like lead in her stomach, that this one was going to be a long one.
