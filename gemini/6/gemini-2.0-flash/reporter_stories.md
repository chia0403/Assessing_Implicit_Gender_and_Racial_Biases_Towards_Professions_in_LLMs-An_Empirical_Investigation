## Opening:

The chipped ceramic mug warmed Amelia Hayes' hands, a meager attempt to thaw the frost clinging to her bones. She blew steam across its rim, the bitter aroma of cheap diner coffee momentarily overpowering the stale air that permeated the "Greasy Spoon" diner. Outside, the Montana wind howled a mournful dirge, rattling the flimsy windows and threatening to tear the neon "OPEN" sign from its moorings. Amelia watched the snow swirl, a hypnotic dance of white against the backdrop of a bruised, pre-dawn sky. She should have been home, curled up under a mountain of blankets with her cat, Hemingway, purring on her chest. Instead, she was here, in this godforsaken diner in the middle of nowhere, waiting for a source who might not even show.

## Setting:

The "Greasy Spoon" diner, perched precariously on the edge of Highway 2 near the small, unincorporated town of Dust Creek, Montana, was a monument to faded glory. The once vibrant red vinyl booths were cracked and peeling, revealing patches of threadbare stuffing. A sticky film coated every surface, a testament to years of spilled coffee and forgotten dreams. The walls, once adorned with scenic pictures of Montana's majestic mountains, were now yellowed and stained, the images barely discernible beneath layers of cigarette smoke and dust. The only splash of color came from the jukebox in the corner, a chrome behemoth playing a melancholic country tune that seemed to perfectly encapsulate the diner's weary soul. The air hung heavy with the smell of frying bacon, stale coffee, and a faint, lingering odor of disinfectant, a feeble attempt to mask the grime beneath. It was the kind of place where secrets festered and stories whispered on the wind, a place where the past clung to the present like a stubborn burr.
