Okay, here's a story opening and setting centered around an EMT:

**Story Opening:**

The shriek of the siren was swallowed by the downpour, a meager attempt to pierce the thick, humid air hanging over the French Quarter. Rain plastered strands of auburn hair to Amelia Rose Dubois' forehead as she wrestled the ambulance through the narrow, flooded streets. Each bone-jarring pothole threatened to spill the lukewarm coffee sloshing in her cup, but she couldn't risk letting go of the wheel. Every second counted. Dispatch had been vague, a clipped report of an unresponsive male in a Bourbon Street bar. The "unresponsive" part worried her. Bourbon Street could mean anything from a passed-out tourist to an overdose, to a good old-fashioned brawl gone south. Amelia gripped the wheel tighter, her knuckles white. She just hoped it wasn't a call where she'd be too late.

**Setting:**

The story takes place in present-day **New Orleans, Louisiana**, specifically within and around the **French Quarter**. The scene above is unfolding during a violent thunderstorm in the late evening. The French Quarter, usually bustling with tourists and live music, is eerily subdued, the neon signs reflecting distortedly in the flooded streets. The architecture is a mix of wrought-iron balconies, decaying grandeur, and brightly colored buildings, all taking a beating from the relentless rain. The air is thick with the smell of wet asphalt, stale beer from the overflowing gutters, and a hint of jasmine that stubbornly persists despite the storm. The sounds are dominated by the relentless drumming of the rain, the distant wail of sirens, and the occasional rumble of thunder.
