## Story Opening:

The antiseptic smell of the clinic clung to Dr. Eleanor Beatrice Ainsworth like a second skin, a constant reminder of the battles fought, won, and tragically lost within its walls. Tonight, however, the familiar scent was tinged with something else: the cloying sweetness of lilies, a bouquet delivered anonymously this morning with a card bearing only a single, unsettling word: "Remember."

Eleanor stared at the bouquet, now wilting precariously on her desk, the petals browning at the edges. The late-night silence of the empty clinic pressed in on her, amplified by the rhythmic hum of the ventilation system. Outside, a steady drizzle plastered the neon signs of the city onto the slick asphalt.

She’d received strange things before, being the only physician for miles willing to treat the rough-and-tumble denizens of Oakhaven. But this… this felt different. Less like a threat, and more like a buried memory clawing its way to the surface. A memory she wasn’t sure she wanted to unearth.

## Setting:

The story is set in **Oakhaven, a forgotten corner of industrial Pennsylvania**, clinging to the edge of the Allegheny Mountains. It was once a bustling coal-mining town, but now the mines are closed, leaving behind a skeleton of rusting infrastructure and a population scarred by poverty and desperation.

Dr. Ainsworth's clinic, a modest brick building squeezed between a dilapidated bar and a pawn shop, is a beacon of hope in this bleak landscape. The interior is functional but clean, with worn linoleum floors and mismatched furniture donated by sympathetic townsfolk. A single, flickering fluorescent light illuminates the waiting room, casting long, distorted shadows. Outside, the air is thick with the smell of coal dust and rain, a constant reminder of Oakhaven's dying past and uncertain future.
