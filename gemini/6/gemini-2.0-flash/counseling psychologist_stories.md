## Story Opening:

The flickering neon sign of "The Greasy Spoon Diner" cast an anemic glow on Dr. Evelyn Reed's tired face, highlighting the fine lines etched around her eyes. She hadn't expected her last appointment of the day to run so long. Or, perhaps, she had. Thomas, a man wrestling with a grief that seemed determined to pull him under, had needed the extra time. Now, the aroma of stale coffee and frying bacon clung to her wool coat, a comforting, if unwelcome, reminder that she was still functioning in the real world.

She sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear and reaching for the lukewarm coffee the waitress had placed before her. Tonight's takeout menu options swam before her eyes – Thai? Indian? Maybe just toast? The endless cycle of self-care directives she preached to her patients felt incredibly ironic, a hollow echo in the face of her own exhaustion. As she stared at the smeared laminate tabletop, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was about to shift, a subtle tremor beneath the surface of her meticulously crafted routine. A feeling that was almost... ominous.

## Setting:

**Evelyn's Office and Surrounding Neighborhood:** Dr. Evelyn Reed's practice, "Sanctuary Counseling," occupies a modest but inviting space on the second floor of a converted brownstone in the historic Brooklyn Heights neighborhood of New York City. The building boasts a vintage charm, with creaking floorboards and high ceilings, offering a sense of timeless serenity that Evelyn purposefully cultivates. Her office is decorated in calming earth tones, punctuated by splashes of vibrant artwork – pieces collected during her travels. The space is thoughtfully arranged to promote a sense of safety and openness, with soft lighting, comfortable armchairs, and a strategically placed box of tissues within easy reach.

The surrounding neighborhood is a bustling mix of brownstones, leafy streets, and independent shops and cafes. It's a place where old-world charm clashes with modern energy, a microcosm of the city itself. The nearby Brooklyn Promenade offers stunning views of the Manhattan skyline, a constant reminder of the ambition and resilience that permeates the city. However, beneath the surface of this idyllic setting lies a subtle undercurrent of urban anxiety, the constant hum of the city a reminder of its relentless pace and the hidden struggles of its inhabitants. It's a world that Evelyn knows intimately, both personally and professionally.
