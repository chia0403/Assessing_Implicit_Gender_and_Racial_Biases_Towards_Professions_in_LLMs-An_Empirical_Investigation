## Story Opening:

The sun, a molten coin in the eastern sky, was just beginning to burn away the morning mist clinging to the granite cliffs. Silas Bartholomew Thorne, calloused hands already gripping his hammer, spat on his calluses and tested the point of his chisel against a stray pebble. The rhythmic clang of his neighbor's work already echoed through the air, a competitive hum that always pricked at Silas's pride. Today, however, he wouldn't be drawn into a race. Today, he would begin carving the Sea God's Crest.

He inhaled deeply, the scent of damp earth and sharp stone filling his lungs. This commission, the largest of his career, wasn't about speed, but about reverence. About proving to the elders, and more importantly, to himself, that he was more than just a hammer-swinging laborer. He was an artist. A sculptor. A shaper of dreams from the very heart of the mountain.

Silas shifted his weight, the rough wool of his tunic scratching against his skin. He stared at the immense slab of granite before him, its grey surface still damp with dew. Within that stone, he knew, lay the potential for majesty. But getting it out, that was the challenge. A challenge that could either cement his legacy or crush it beneath the weight of its own unyielding form.

## Setting:

The story takes place in the village of **Stonehaven**, nestled in the foothills of the **Greyfang Mountains**. The village is almost entirely built from the same grey granite that forms the mountains themselves. Buildings huddle together, solid and squat, with slate roofs and small, deeply recessed windows to protect against the harsh mountain winds.

The air is perpetually cool and damp, carrying the scent of moss, pine, and the ever-present dust of freshly cut stone. The dominant sound is the rhythmic clang of hammers and chisels against granite, a constant soundtrack to village life.

Stonehaven's livelihood is almost entirely dependent on the quarrying and carving of stone. From building materials to elaborate sculptures for the wealthier coastal cities, Stonehaven provides it all. The village is governed by a council of elders, comprised of the most experienced and respected stonecutters, who dictate the allocation of resources and settle disputes. The village lives and breathes stone, and a man's worth is judged by the skill with which he can shape it.
