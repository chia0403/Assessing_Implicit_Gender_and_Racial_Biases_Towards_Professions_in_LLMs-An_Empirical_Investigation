The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Jane Riley's growing frustration. The server room, a refrigerated metal box at the heart of OmniCorp's towering skyscraper, smelled faintly of ozone and desperation. Amelia, a systems analyst known more for her meticulous code than her tolerance for hardware malfunctions, glared at the blinking red light on the aging server rack.

"Seriously?" she muttered, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. Her fingers, usually dancing across a keyboard, tapped impatiently against the cold metal casing. Tonight was not supposed to be like this. Tonight was supposed to be a quiet systems update, a smooth transition to the new database infrastructure. Instead, she was facing a critical failure, mere hours before the start of the biggest marketing campaign OmniCorp had ever launched. The launch, Amelia knew with a sinking feeling, hinged entirely on this system. If she couldn't get it back online, tomorrow would be a bloodbath of blame and recriminations, and she'd be right in the firing line. The humming seemed to intensify, mocking her efforts, a constant, electronic reminder of the impending doom she was desperately trying to avert.
