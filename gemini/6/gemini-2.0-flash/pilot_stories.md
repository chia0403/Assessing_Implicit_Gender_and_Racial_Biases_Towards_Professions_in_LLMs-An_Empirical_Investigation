The wind howled a mournful song through the canyons, whistling around the corrugated metal walls of the hangar as Amelia “Ace” Stone shivered, pulling her worn leather jacket tighter. Dust devils danced across the cracked concrete floor, swirling around the legs of the battered P-51 Mustang she lovingly called "Rebel." The Mustang, a veteran of a forgotten war, was Amelia's pride and joy, a testament to her stubborn refusal to let go of the past – or her dreams.

The setting was Redemption, Arizona, a flyspeck town clinging precariously to the edge of the unforgiving Mojave Desert. Redemption wasn't on any map that mattered, just a cluster of sun-baked buildings, a dusty airstrip, and the ghosts of prospectors who'd chased fool's gold a century ago. Now, the town eked out a living on the occasional tourist passing through and the even rarer cargo run needing a pilot willing to brave the unpredictable desert winds. Amelia, with her skills honed in countless air races and her unwavering dedication to her craft, was that pilot.

The clock on the hangar wall ticked with agonizing slowness. 04:17. Another three minutes until her phone pinged with the pre-arranged code – the signal that the old man, Silas, needed her services. Services that were always… complicated. And always came with a hefty paycheck.
