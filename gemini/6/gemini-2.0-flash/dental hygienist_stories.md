The oppressive humidity clung to Savannah like Spanish moss, making the short walk from the parking garage to the dental office feel like a marathon through a sauna. Abigail “Abby” Grace Montgomery, her meticulously styled auburn bob already threatening to frizz, sighed and pulled her navy blazer tighter around her starched white uniform. She always felt a little overdressed, a little too polished, in a city that favored sundresses and bare feet.

Abby worked at Gentle Smiles Dental, a quaint practice tucked away on a brick-paved street just off Chippewa Square. The building itself, a meticulously restored Victorian, was all gingerbread trim and welcoming porch swings. Inside, however, Dr. Silas Croft, a man as old as the live oak tree outside, insisted on keeping the décor a vibrant, almost offensively cheerful, shade of turquoise and orange, a testament to his unwavering, and arguably misguided, love for the 1970s. The aroma of antiseptic and bubblegum-flavored fluoride mingled uneasily with the faint, persistent smell of boiled peanuts that wafted in from a nearby vendor, creating a unique olfactory cocktail that Abby had long since grown accustomed to, but secretly despised. As she pushed open the heavy oak door, the cheerful, albeit jarring, chimes of a seashell mobile tinkled above her head, announcing her arrival and marking the beginning of another day filled with plaque, polishing, and patiently explaining the importance of flossing to people who clearly weren't listening. Today, she was particularly dreading Mrs. Higgins, whose dentures had been particularly…challenging…the last time she was in.
