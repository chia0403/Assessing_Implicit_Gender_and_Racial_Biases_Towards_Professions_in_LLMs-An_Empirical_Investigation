The air hung thick and sweet with the scent of jasmine and brine as Rosalind Mallory, a woman who knew Charleston, South Carolina like the back of her hand and often joked she could taste the history clinging to the cobblestones, squinted at the approaching cluster of tourists. Each group was a gamble, a toss of the dice on whether they’d be interested in the nuanced stories of the city’s hidden corners or just wanted to snap selfies with pastel houses.

Rosalind adjusted the brim of her straw hat, the embroidered palmetto tree swaying gently in the warm breeze. She stood on Rainbow Row, that iconic stretch of vibrantly painted Georgian row houses facing the harbor. Across the street, horse-drawn carriages clattered past, their drivers offering snippets of Charleston’s history in drawling accents that Rosalind found endearing, even if they sometimes glossed over the more uncomfortable truths. Beyond the carriages, the Cooper River shimmered under the relentless Carolina sun, dotted with sailboats dancing on the waves. 

This was her stage, and she was ready to perform. Even after ten years of leading tours, the city still held secrets she yearned to share, stories etched into the very bricks and mortar of Charleston's soul. Today, she would be guiding a group through the historic French Quarter, hoping to peel back the layers of charming facades and reveal the complex and compelling narrative beneath.
