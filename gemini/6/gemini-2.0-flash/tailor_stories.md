**Setting:** The biting winds of late November whipped down Leake Street, a narrow thoroughfare in Leeds choked with factories belching coal smoke and the grime of the Industrial Revolution. Gas lamps, struggling against the gloom, cast flickering pools of light on the cobbled street. The air was thick with the smell of soot, damp wool, and something faintly metallic – the ever-present scent of industry.

**Opening:** Ebenezer Thistlewick, his breath misting in the frigid air, pressed a gloved hand against the icy windowpane of his small tailor shop. Thistlewick & Son, the sign proclaimed in faded gold lettering, though the ‘Son’ had tragically departed some fifteen years ago. He squinted, trying to discern the silhouettes hurrying past, their faces obscured by scarves and pulled-down caps. Not a single one paused to even glance at his window display: a meticulously crafted wool coat, its lapels angled with the precise artistry only Ebenezer could achieve. Trade had been slow. Deathly slow. He rubbed the persistent ache in his fingers, a consequence of years spent hunched over fabric in this perpetually damp and drafty shop, and sighed. Another day threatened to slip away without a single sale. Another day closer to ruin. Perhaps he should have listened to his brother and moved to London, embracing the new fashions instead of clinging to the traditions of bespoke tailoring. But London felt like a surrender, a betrayal of the craft that was in his very blood. No, Ebenezer Thistlewick would rather starve in Leeds than compromise his art in the clamor of the capital. He straightened, forcing a flicker of hope onto his weary face. Perhaps… perhaps the afternoon would bring a miracle.
