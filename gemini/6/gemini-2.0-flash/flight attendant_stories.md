## Story Opening:

The clatter of ice against plastic was a familiar symphony to Amelia Rose Harding. She expertly balanced the drink tray, navigating the slightly jerky aisle of the Boeing 777 with the practiced grace of a seasoned dancer. Outside, the inky blackness of the Atlantic stretched on forever, punctuated only by the distant, twinkling constellations. Inside, however, was a microcosm of human anxieties and expectations, a theatre of controlled chaos playing out at 35,000 feet.

She smiled, a genuine smile that reached her perpetually tired eyes, as she offered a ginger ale to a young boy clutching a worn teddy bear. "Here you go, sweetie. Something for that little guy too?" she asked, nodding towards the bear with a wink. The boy giggled, momentarily forgetting whatever fear had been clinging to him before.

But the warm, comforting scene was immediately followed by a more pressing demand. "Excuse me!" a gruff voice boomed from seat 32B. "Where the hell is my scotch? I ordered it fifteen minutes ago!"

Amelia took a deep breath, the smile on her face stiffening slightly. It was going to be one of *those* flights.

## Setting:

The story is set aboard a Boeing 777, specifically **AirFrance Flight 014 from Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport to New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport**. It's a late-night flight, leaving Paris around 10 PM local time, meaning the majority of the passengers are either trying to sleep or are restless and prone to irritability. The cabin lights are dimmed, but pockets of activity persist - the glow of personal entertainment screens, the hushed whispers of couples, the sporadic bursts of laughter from the galley. The overall atmosphere is a mix of boredom, anxiety, and the general discomfort of being confined to a small space for an extended period. The temperature is kept deliberately cool, a tactic designed to combat the stuffiness of the cabin, but often leaving passengers reaching for the thin, fleece blankets.
