The humid Louisiana air hung heavy, thick with the scent of magnolia and something faintly…fishy. Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth, her brow already slick with perspiration, squinted at the peeling paint on the porch of Mrs. Dubois' shotgun house. Cicadas buzzed a relentless, deafening chorus, and the Spanish moss draping the ancient live oaks swayed like ghostly curtains in the sluggish breeze.

Eleanor sighed, adjusting the oversized tote bag on her shoulder that held her therapy tools – a motley collection of putty, resistance bands, and adaptive eating utensils. She loved New Orleans, loved the vibrant culture, the music, the food, the indomitable spirit of its people, but sometimes, this oppressive heat just sapped the energy right out of you.

She pushed open the creaking gate, its ironwork resembling a tangled mess of vines, and headed towards the front door. This was her last appointment of the day, and Mrs. Dubois, bless her heart, was a challenge. Recovering from a stroke, the woman was stubborn, fiercely independent, and deeply suspicious of anyone trying to "fix" her. Eleanor knew this wasn't going to be easy, but she also knew that beneath the gruff exterior, Mrs. Dubois desperately wanted to regain her independence. And Eleanor Ainsworth was nothing if not determined.
