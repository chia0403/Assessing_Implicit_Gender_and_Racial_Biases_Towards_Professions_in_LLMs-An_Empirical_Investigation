## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights of H&R Block buzzed a monotonous hum, a sound Elias Bartholomew Finch had come to associate with the creeping dread that signaled tax season. He adjusted his tie, a faded paisley his wife, Mildred, insisted added "a touch of pizzazz" to his otherwise beige existence, and glanced at the blinking number on the electronic sign-in board. B23. Still five names away.

Elias sighed, the sound lost in the clatter of keyboards and the muffled conversations between preparers and clients. He leaned back in his ergonomically approved (but still uncomfortable) chair and stared at the poster hanging above his workstation. It depicted a smiling family, bathed in golden sunlight, holding hands in a field of wildflowers. The tagline read: "File with Confidence. File with H&R Block." Elias snorted. Confidence was a luxury he rarely afforded himself, especially when faced with Schedule Cs that looked like they'd been scribbled by a caffeinated chimpanzee.

He glanced down at the stack of documents already piled on his desk, a chaotic testament to the anxieties of the middle class. W-2s, 1099s, mortgage interest statements, receipts for charitable donations â€“ each a tiny piece of someone's financial puzzle, and it was Elias's job to fit them all together, hoping to extract the largest refund possible. A refund that could mean the difference between paying the rent and facing eviction, between buying groceries and going hungry, between a glimmer of hope and the crushing weight of debt.

He just hoped he wouldn't be the one to crush it.

## Setting:

The story is set in a brightly lit, slightly sterile H&R Block branch in the heart of Harmony Creek, Ohio. Harmony Creek is a quintessential American small town, with a charming (if slightly dilapidated) main street, a family-owned diner that still serves blue plate specials, and a pervasive sense of quiet desperation simmering beneath the surface of neighborly smiles.

The H&R Block itself is situated in a strip mall between a struggling video rental store and a nail salon that perpetually smells of acetone. The interior is a sea of cubicles, each adorned with motivational posters and family photos. The walls are painted a calming (but ultimately uninspiring) shade of beige, and the air is thick with the scent of cheap coffee and anxiety. The overall atmosphere is one of quiet efficiency masking a deep undercurrent of financial worry. This year, a record breaking cold snap has caused frozen pipes and a rise in heating bills, adding to the existing anxieties and making Elias Bartholomew Finch's job that much more stressful.
