The late afternoon sun, a bruised apricot color, bled through the gaps in the blinds of Arthur Penhaligonâ€™s small office. It painted stripes across the worn, navy-blue carpet, highlighting the dust motes dancing in the air, each one a tiny, insignificant speck reflecting the vastness of the universe. A fitting metaphor, Arthur thought, for the existential dread he currently felt.

Arthur Penhaligon, Senior Insurance Agent for the North Eastern Mutual Life Assurance Company (North Eastern Mutual for short, thank God), slumped back in his faux-leather swivel chair. The chair groaned in protest, a sympathetic sound that mirrored the ache in his lower back and the dull throb behind his eyes. He stared at the stack of policy applications looming on his desk, a miniature paper mountain range he was supposed to conquer before closing time. But the phone hadn't stopped ringing since nine AM, each call bringing a new tale of woe, a fresh tragedy, a different way in which life had blindsided someone. He'd heard about car accidents, house fires, and even, inexplicably, a goat attack that had resulted in significant property damage. And all he could offer were policies, clauses, and deductibles. A band-aid on a gaping wound.

His office was located on the third floor of the Commerce Building in the heart of Brindlewood, Ohio, a town best known for its annual corn festival and the crippling ennui that seemed to seep into the very foundations of its buildings. The Commerce Building itself was a testament to faded glory, its once-impressive art deco facade now crumbling and stained with years of soot and pigeon droppings. Inside, the linoleum floors were scuffed and chipped, the elevator perpetually smelled of stale coffee and regret, and the overall atmosphere was one of quiet desperation. It was, in short, the perfect place for Arthur Penhaligon to contemplate the meaninglessness of existence, while simultaneously trying to sell someone a policy against alien abduction.
