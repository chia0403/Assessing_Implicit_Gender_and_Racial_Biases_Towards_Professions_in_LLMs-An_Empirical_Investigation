## Story Opening

The scream of the chainsaw was a familiar lullaby to Jedediah "Jed" Bartholomew, a high-pitched shriek that sliced through the crisp mountain air and echoed off the ancient, moss-draped pines. He braced his legs against the steep incline, the scent of sawdust and pine resin filling his nostrils. The wind, a frigid caress that promised a long winter, whipped strands of his auburn hair across his weathered face. Another groan, another splintering crack, and a giant Redwood, older than his great-grandpappy, toppled with a thunderous crash, shaking the very ground beneath his boots.

Jedediah cut the engine, the sudden silence amplifying the rustling leaves and the distant caw of a raven. He wiped the sweat from his brow with a calloused hand, leaving a streak of grime across his forehead. His back ached, his muscles screamed, but a grim satisfaction settled in his gut. Another tree felled, another day closer to feeding his family.

## Setting

The setting is the rugged, densely forested region of Northern California, specifically within a privately-owned logging area nestled in the shadow of the Redwood National and State Parks. The landscape is dominated by towering Redwood trees, interspersed with Douglas firs and other coniferous species. The terrain is steep and challenging, characterized by rocky slopes, deep ravines, and rushing streams. The air is generally cool and damp, with frequent fog and heavy rainfall, especially during the fall and winter months.

Jedediah's logging operation is a small, family-run affair, using relatively traditional methods. Their camp consists of a few weathered cabins and sheds, located near the edge of the logging area. It's a place of hard work and simple living, far removed from the modern conveniences of the nearby towns. The nearest town, Eureka, is a significant distance away, accessible only by a winding, often treacherous, dirt road. This isolation reinforces the close-knit community of loggers and their families, who rely on each other for support and survival in this demanding environment.
