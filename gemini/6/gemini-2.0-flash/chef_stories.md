The scent of roasting garlic and thyme hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma that battled the biting February wind whistling through the poorly-insulated windows of the galley. Inside, Chef Evangeline "Eva" Dubois, her dark hair escaping the confines of her knotted headscarf, wrestled a stubborn salmon fillet onto a bed of wilted spinach. 

The setting was the cramped, perpetually damp kitchen of the *Sea Serpent*, a dilapidated fishing trawler owned by Captain "One-Eyed" Pete. The ship, more rust than paint these days, was currently bobbing precariously in the churning waters just off the coast of Newfoundland. Eva, a graduate of Le Cordon Bleu no less, found herself a long way from the Michelin-starred restaurants of Paris she had dreamed of. But dreams, she'd learned in the unforgiving Atlantic, didnâ€™t pay the bills. And besides, there was a certain stark beauty to the endless gray horizon, a freedom in being untethered, even if it was to a vessel that seemed determined to sink at any given moment. The crew, a motley collection of grizzled fishermen and world-weary deckhands, were a far cry from the discerning palates she'd once catered to. But they appreciated a hearty meal, and tonight, after a particularly brutal day hauling nets, they deserved something more than just another pot of stew. Evangeline Dubois, against all odds, intended to give it to them.
