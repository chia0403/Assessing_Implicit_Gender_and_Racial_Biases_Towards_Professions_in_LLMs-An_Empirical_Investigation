## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The story opens on the grounds of Blackwood Manor, a sprawling, gothic revival estate perched precariously on the windswept cliffs of Cornwall, England. Ivy, thick as cobwebs, clambers up the grey stone walls, obscuring gargoyles and blurring the edges of window frames. The sea, a churning, dark green beast, roars incessantly below, its spray occasionally kissing the manicured lawns closest to the edge. A perpetual mist, smelling of salt and damp earth, hangs in the air, lending the place an air of melancholic mystery.

**Story Opening:**

The insistent drone of the lawnmower cut through the mournful cry of a distant gull. **Bartholomew "Bart" Finch**, groundskeeper of Blackwood Manor for the past thirty years, sighed, wiping a bead of sweat from his brow. The damned thing was always acting up. Just like the rest of this blasted place. He yanked harder on the pull-cord, the engine sputtering to life with a reluctant cough. Another week, another sea of emerald to tame. Bart wasn't one for complaining, but the constant damp was playing havoc with his arthritis, and the whispers... well, the whispers were getting louder. He squinted at the crumbling sundial in the center of the lawn, its Roman numerals almost completely eroded by the relentless sea air. He swore he saw a shadow flicker across its face, too quick to be real. Just the light playing tricks, he told himself, but the prickling at the back of his neck wouldn't subside. Blackwood Manor had always held its secrets close, but lately, Bart Finch felt like it was finally ready to share them, whether he was ready to listen or not. And he had a nasty feeling those secrets weren’t the kind you’d want to hear.
