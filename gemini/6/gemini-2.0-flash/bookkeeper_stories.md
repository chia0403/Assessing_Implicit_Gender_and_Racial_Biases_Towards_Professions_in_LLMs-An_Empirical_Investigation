The fluorescent lights of "Accuracy First Bookkeeping" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack that rivaled the incessant clicking of Beatrice Eleanor Quillington's keyboard. Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the strip mall, painting the dusty windows of Mrs. Higgins' Dog Grooming and "Oriental Rugs!

Her cubicle, a testament to both order and quiet desperation, was meticulously organized. Every pen sat at precisely a 45-degree angle in its holder. Every file was labelled in neat, block letters. Even the motivational poster – a kitten clinging precariously to a tree branch, captioned "Hang In There!" – was perfectly centered. It was all meticulously, almost obsessively, controlled, a tiny island of sanity in the swirling ocean of receipts and spreadsheets that threatened to consume her.

Just one more invoice to reconcile… the one for “Exotic Birds R Us.” She adjusted her spectacles and took a deep breath, ready to plunge back into the world of parrot food and suspiciously high-priced macaw sales.
