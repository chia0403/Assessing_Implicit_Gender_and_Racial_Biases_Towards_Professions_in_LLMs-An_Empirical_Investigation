The incessant drumming of rain against the corrugated iron roof was doing little to soothe Alistair Finch's fraying nerves. He hadn't slept properly in days, fueled by lukewarm coffee and the faint scent of decay that clung to everything in this forsaken corner of the Philippines. Outside, the jungle pulsed with an unseen life, a chorus of chirps and clicks that seemed to mock his anxieties. Inside, his cramped room in the crumbling Lola Maria Pension House felt like a pressure cooker, the humid air thick with the anticipation of something unpleasant.

Alistair Finch, Investigative Journalist for the 'Global Observer', wasn't usually one for superstition, but a nagging unease had settled in his gut the moment he stepped off the rickety ferry onto the island of Palawan. His editor had dismissed it as pre-report jitters, but Alistair knew better. There was something rotten lurking beneath the veneer of this tropical paradise, something beyond the usual political corruption and environmental degradation. He could smell it, feel it in the way the locals averted their eyes when he asked too many questions. He was here to uncover the truth behind the disappearance of Dr. Elena Ramirez, a marine biologist who had vanished without a trace six months ago while researching the dwindling coral reefs. The official report pointed to a boating accident, but Alistair suspected something far more sinister. The silence surrounding her name was deafening, and Alistair Finch had a knack for making the silent speak.
