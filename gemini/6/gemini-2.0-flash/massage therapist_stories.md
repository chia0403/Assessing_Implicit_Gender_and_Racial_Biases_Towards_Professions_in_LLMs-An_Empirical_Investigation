**Opening:**

The rhythmic percussion of rain against the panoramic windows was almost hypnotic, mirroring the careful movements of Evelyn Rose Thatcher's hands. It was a Tuesday afternoon, generally a quieter day at The Sanctuary, the luxury spa she called her professional home. But even the relentless downpour hadn't deterred the woman currently face-down on her table, a tightly wound knot of anxiety practically radiating off her expensive cashmere robe. Evelyn pressed deeper, her thumb finding the spot where tension bloomed like a stubborn weed. A small groan, followed by a sigh, escaped the woman's lips. Progress. Slowly, painstakingly, Evelyn would coax the stress out of her, like coaxing a butterfly from a chrysalis. It was the kind of work that soothed her as much as it soothed her clients.

**Setting:**

The Sanctuary was tucked away in the foothills of the Berkshire Mountains, a haven of serenity built from polished stone and warm woods. Sunlight, even on dreary days, filtered through the strategically placed skylights, bathing the reception area in a soft glow. Water trickled gently down a moss-covered wall, creating a calming white noise that masked the sounds of the nearby highway. Each treatment room was a miniature oasis, decorated with calming colors, aromatherapy diffusers, and heated massage tables. The scent of lavender and eucalyptus hung heavy in the air, promising relaxation and rejuvenation. The clientele was predominantly affluent, ranging from stressed-out CEOs escaping the city for the weekend to local residents seeking respite from the pressures of daily life.
