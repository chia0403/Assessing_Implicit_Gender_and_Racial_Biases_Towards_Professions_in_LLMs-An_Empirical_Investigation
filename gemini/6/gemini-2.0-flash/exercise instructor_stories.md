The stale scent of sweat and lemon-scented cleaner hung heavy in the air, clinging to the exposed brick walls of "Ironclad Fitness." It was 5:45 AM, the sky outside still a bruised purple, and the hum of the overhead fluorescent lights buzzed impatiently. Amelia Beatrice Sterling, a woman built like a coiled spring and radiating enough energy to power a small town, surveyed the empty studio with a critical eye. A stray resistance band lay coiled like a lazy snake near the weight rack. She nudged it with the toe of her vibrant pink sneaker.

Amelia ran a hand through her tightly braided hair, the movement revealing the sharp lines of her cheekbones. She always arrived early, needing the quiet to center herself before the dawn deluge of caffeine-fueled gym-goers arrived, ready to be sculpted and pushed to their limit. This morning, though, the quiet felt different. An undercurrent of… anticipation, maybe? Or was it just the lingering dread of facing Mrs. Higgins in the 6 AM HIIT class, the woman who insisted on wearing full makeup and would argue vehemently that her burpees counted, even if they resembled more of a theatrical collapse. Whatever it was, Amelia felt a strange tightness in her chest, a feeling she couldn't quite shake. This morning, Ironclad Fitness felt less like a sanctuary and more like a stage, and Amelia Beatrice Sterling, normally so confident, felt strangely… vulnerable.
