## Story Opening and Setting

**Setting:** The late afternoon sun, thick and honeyed, dripped through the grimy windows of "Petal & Bloom," a tiny flower shop nestled between a bustling bakery and a perpetually-under-construction laundromat in the heart of Chicago's Wicker Park. The air inside was a fragrant riot: the crisp, sweet scent of lilies battling with the earthy musk of damp moss and the sharp, peppery tang of carnations.

**Story Opening:**

The bell above the door jingled, announcing a new arrival, but **Eleanor Violet Bloom** didn't look up. She was elbows-deep in a bucket of muddy water, wrestling with a stubborn bundle of hydrangeas. The petals, the shade of a bruised summer sky, threatened to shatter at the slightest pressure. Eleanor sighed, a wisp of a sound lost in the ambient noise of the city outside. Hydrangeas. Her nemesis. Beautiful, temperamental, and almost always overpriced. She preferred the sturdy honesty of sunflowers or the quiet resilience of succulents, but Mrs. Petrovich, the owner of the bakery next door, insisted on hydrangeas for her daughter's engagement party. Eleanor owed Mrs. Petrovich a favor (and a slice of her famous poppyseed cake), so hydrangeas it was.

"Eleanor? You in the back?" A voice, high and reedy, sliced through the floral chaos. Eleanor finally straightened, wiping her hands on her stained apron, a patchwork of floral prints and stubborn earth. Her fingers, permanently tinged green, ached. "Coming, Grandma Rose!" she called, already bracing herself for whatever crisis awaited.
