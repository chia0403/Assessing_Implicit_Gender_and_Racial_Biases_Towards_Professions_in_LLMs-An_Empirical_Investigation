## The Story Opening:

The chipped, faux-marble countertop was cold under Amelia Rose Beaumont's elbow. She sighed, the sound barely audible over the gentle tinkling of the fountain in the lobby of the Grand Zenith Hotel. Another Tuesday evening. Another symphony of impeccably-dressed guests returning from galas, hurried business travellers checking in for early flights, and the occasional, furtive couple sneaking off to rooms with names like "Azure Dream" and "Crimson Passion." Amelia Rose knew them all. She knew their preferred champagne, their allergies, their secrets whispered during harried booking calls. She was, after all, the Grand Zenith's head concierge, a title that sounded far grander than the reality of dispensing directions to the nearest organic juice bar and retrieving misplaced phone chargers.

Tonight, however, felt different. A low thrum of unease, a prickling at the back of her neck that wasn’t just from the starched collar of her uniform. The air, usually thick with the scent of expensive cologne and lilies, held a faint, metallic tang. And outside, past the revolving doors and the doorman’s stiff smile, the city of Chicago seemed to be holding its breath.

## The Setting:

The **Grand Zenith Hotel** dominates a prominent corner of Chicago's River North neighborhood. Constructed in the Art Deco style of the 1920s, its towering presence is softened by intricate carvings of celestial motifs: stylized sunbursts, swirling galaxies, and watchful eyes that seem to follow passersby. The lobby is a cavernous space, a testament to bygone glamour. Polished chrome gleams under the soft glow of chandeliers, reflecting the rich hues of the patterned carpets and velvet upholstery. A grand, winding staircase, often used for dramatic entrances and photoshoots, leads to the upper floors, where suites boast panoramic views of the Chicago skyline.

Behind the concierge desk, which Amelia Rose presides over, is a wall map of the city, intricately detailed and annotated with handwritten recommendations for everything from hidden speakeasies to the best deep-dish pizza. A small, cluttered office sits just behind the desk, crammed with maps, brochures, and a perpetually ringing phone. It is from this vantage point that Amelia Rose Beaumont observes the city and its inhabitants, a silent guardian of secrets and orchestrator of experiences within the opulent walls of the Grand Zenith.
