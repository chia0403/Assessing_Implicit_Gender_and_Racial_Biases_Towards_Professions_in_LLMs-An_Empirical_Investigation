Rain lashed against the panoramic window of Elias Thorne's apartment, the city lights blurring into a shimmering, impressionistic painting.  Thirty-two stories above the relentless churn of downtown Seattle, the only sounds were the rhythmic drumming of the downpour and the quiet click-clack of Elias's keyboard. His apartment, a minimalist haven of polished concrete, exposed brick, and carefully curated tech, reflected his personality: precise, efficient, and a little bit cold.  Empty takeout containers littered the surface of his sleek, standing desk, testaments to a week fueled by caffeine and deadline pressure.  Elias, his dark hair pulled back in a messy bun, squinted at the lines of code scrolling across his monitor, the glow reflecting in his tired, hazel eyes. He was so close to cracking the encryption, so close to unveiling the secret hidden within the seemingly innocuous data stream he'd intercepted. He just needed a few more hours, maybe a few more lines of codeâ€¦ and another double-shot espresso.  The future of his company, Cygnus Technologies, and perhaps something far more significant, hung in the balance.
