The sun, a malevolent eye in the bleached-blue sky, beat down on Elias Vance's neon-orange vest. Heat shimmered off the asphalt of Interstate 40, blurring the horizon where the New Mexico desert met a sky the color of faded denim.  Dust devils danced in the distance, kicking up spirals of red dirt like miniature tornadoes.  Elias, sweat beading on his brow beneath the brim of his hard hat, wiped his forehead with a calloused hand. The air, thick and heavy, vibrated with the low thrum of distant traffic and the insistent chirp of cicadas.  He adjusted the reflective stripes on his vest and squinted down the seemingly endless stretch of highway, where the flashing arrow signs of his work zone blinked a monotonous warning. A discarded tire lay half-buried in the sand at the edge of the road, a testament to the unforgiving nature of both the desert and the highway that sliced through it.  Today's job: patching a series of potholes that threatened to swallow small cars whole.  It wasn't glamorous work, but it was honest, and for Elias, that was enough.  For now.
