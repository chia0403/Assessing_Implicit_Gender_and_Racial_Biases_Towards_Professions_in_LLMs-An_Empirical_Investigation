The insistent chirping of a rogue cricket, somehow trapped within the brightly painted walls of Mrs. Eleanor Clementine Higgins' kindergarten classroom, punctuated the otherwise peaceful Sunday afternoon.  Sunlight streamed through the large, rainbow-framed windows of Sunnyside Elementary, illuminating the miniature world within. Tiny chairs sat perched around miniature tables, each adorned with a meticulously crafted name tag.  Construction paper creations, vibrant and slightly crumpled, hung from the ceiling like exotic, paper-mache fruit.  A faint scent of dried Play-Doh and apple juice lingered in the air, a comforting aroma that always clung to Mrs. Higgins' clothes, even on her days off.  Outside, the sleepy town of Harmony Glade, nestled in the heart of the Appalachian Mountains, basked in the golden glow of an early autumn sun.  Leaves just beginning to blush crimson and gold rustled in the gentle breeze, hinting at the crisp air and vibrant hues to come.  Eleanor, however, was oblivious to the idyllic scene unfolding beyond her classroom window.  She was hunched over a tiny wooden desk, a furrow in her brow as she wrestled with a particularly stubborn piece of glitter glue.
