The rusty bell above the door of "Finnian's Fine Cuts and Close Shaves" jingled merrily, a counterpoint to the low rumble of thunder echoing through the narrow streets of Hollow Creek. Rain lashed against the large front window, blurring the reflection of Elias Finch, the barber, meticulously arranging his cut-throat razors on a worn leather strop. Hollow Creek wasn't much – a forgotten speck on the map nestled deep within the Appalachian Mountains – but it was Elias’s home, and Finnian’s, his sanctuary.  The air inside the small barbershop, warmed by a crackling wood stove tucked in the corner, smelled of sandalwood soap and bay rum, a comforting aroma that clung to the faded floral wallpaper and the worn leather of the barber chair.  Elias, a man of few words and fewer wrinkles despite his sixty years, adjusted the brim of his newsboy cap and peered out at the desolate street, wondering if the storm would bring him any customers, or just more trouble.
