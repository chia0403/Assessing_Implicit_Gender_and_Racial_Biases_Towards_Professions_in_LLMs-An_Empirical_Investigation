Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of the penthouse apartment, blurring the normally spectacular view of the Seattle skyline.  Eleanor Vance, her tailored blazer damp from a hasty dash from her car, wiped a stray droplet from her cheek and forced a smile. The potential buyers, a tech-bro couple dripping in designer labels, didn't seem to notice the downpour, their attention fixed on the gleaming stainless steel appliances of the open-plan kitchen.  This was the third showing of the "Skyview Sanctuary" that week, and Eleanor, despite the gnawing feeling that this wouldnâ€™t be *the one*, projected an air of confident optimism. The air, thick with the scent of freshly brewed coffee and the faint tang of ozone from the approaching storm, crackled with unspoken expectations.  The apartment, perched atop the newly built Zenith Tower, represented the pinnacle of luxury living, and Eleanor knew she had to close this deal. Her commission, not to mention her reputation, depended on it.
