The stale, recirculated air of the Denver International Airport hummed a monotonous C-sharp around Beatrice "Bea" Goldfarb as she wrestled her rolling suitcase towards baggage claim.  Outside, the late April sun dipped below the jagged peaks of the Rockies, painting the snow-capped summits a bruised violet. Bea shivered, despite her tailored blazer and the insistent Colorado sunshine that still clung to the terminal windows.  The thin air, so different from the humid mugginess of her native Atlanta, always took some getting used to. This was her third trip to Denver in as many months, each one a desperate attempt to land the Peterson account, a white whale of a client that could make or break her career at Stellar Solar Solutions. This trip, Bea was sure, was going to be different.  She had a new strategy, a revamped presentation, and, most importantly, a reservation at Buckhorn Exchange, Denver's oldest steakhouse, where Mr. Peterson supposedly sealed all his major deals. The carousel lurched into a groaning start, and Bea plastered on her most winning sales smile, the one that hinted at both competence and easy charm.  This time, she vowed, the Peterson account was coming home with her.
