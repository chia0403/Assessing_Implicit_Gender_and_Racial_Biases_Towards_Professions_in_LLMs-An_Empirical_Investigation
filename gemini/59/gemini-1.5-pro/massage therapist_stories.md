The Himalayan salt lamp cast a warm, apricot glow across Serenity Now Massage Therapy, highlighting the dust motes dancing in the late afternoon sunbeams.  Jasmine and sandalwood mingled in the air, a carefully curated olfactory experience designed to soothe even the most frazzled client.  Eliza Jane Cartwright, her hands still tingling with residual energy from her last appointment, glanced at the clock – 4:57 pm. Three minutes until her final client of the day.  She smoothed down her teal linen tunic, adjusted the tiny silver Buddha pendant nestled at the base of her throat, and took a deep, centering breath. Outside, the relentless Los Angeles traffic churned on Sunset Boulevard, but inside, it was an oasis of calm, a sanctuary Eliza had painstakingly created over the last five years.  Today, however, a strange disquiet hummed beneath the surface of the usual tranquility.  Something felt…off.
