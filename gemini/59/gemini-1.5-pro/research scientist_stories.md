The biting Antarctic wind whipped at Dr. Aris Thorne's parka, stinging his exposed cheeks despite the thick layers of protective gear.  He adjusted his goggles, the world shifting from a blurry white expanse to a crisply defined landscape of ice and snow. The McMurdo Research Station, a cluster of brightly colored buildings huddled against the vastness of the Ross Ice Shelf, looked almost toy-like from his vantage point atop Observation Hill.  Beneath his heavy boots, the permafrost crunched, a sound oddly comforting in the desolate silence.  Aris, his breath clouding the frigid air, checked the readings on the handheld spectrometer for the tenth time.  Something was anomalous, something that defied the predictable background radiation of this pristine environment.  A faint, rhythmic pulse resonated from deep within the ice shelf, a signal unlike anything he'd encountered in his five years of studying cosmic radiation in Antarctica.  And it was getting stronger.
