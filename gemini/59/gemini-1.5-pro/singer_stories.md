The flickering gaslight cast long, skeletal shadows across the rain-slicked cobblestones of Rue de Lappe, illuminating the peeling paint of the "Chat Noir" cabaret. Inside, a haze of cigarette smoke hung heavy in the air, thick with the scent of cheap perfume and stale beer.  A melancholic melody drifted out into the night, a mournful saxophone weaving around a delicate piano tune. This was the nightly soundtrack to Genevieve Dubois' life, a life played out on the small, dimly lit stage within.  Genevieve, her full name Genevieve Antoinette Dubois, clutched a worn velvet microphone, her voice a smoky whisper that belied the fire in her emerald green eyes. Tonight, like every night, she sang for the lost souls of Montmartre, for the dreamers and the brokenhearted, for anyone who needed a momentary escape from the harsh realities of 1899 Paris.
