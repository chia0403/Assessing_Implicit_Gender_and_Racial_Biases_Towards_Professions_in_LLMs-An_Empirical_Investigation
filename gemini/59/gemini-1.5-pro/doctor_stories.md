The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne as he hurried across the cobbled courtyard of St. Jude's Hospital, the hem of his long coat snapping at his heels.  Gas lamps flickered against the gothic stonework, casting long, skeletal shadows that danced with the swirling leaves.  Built in 1888, the hospital loomed over the small, isolated town of Oakhaven, nestled deep in the mist-shrouded valleys of the Welsh countryside. Its imposing presence was both a comfort and a source of unease for the townsfolk, a constant reminder of the fragility of life in a place where ancient superstitions still held sway over modern medicine.  Tonight, the unease was particularly potent.  A thick fog, unnatural even for this damp corner of the world, had rolled in with the setting sun, clinging to the valley like a shroud.  And with it, a chilling silence had descended upon Oakhaven, broken only by the rhythmic clang of the church bell tolling the hour – a mournful, metallic echo that seemed to seep into Elias’s very bones.
