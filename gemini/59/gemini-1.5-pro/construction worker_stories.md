Fifty stories below, the Chicago streets buzzed with oblivious ants, their yellow cabs looking like scattered LEGOs. Elias tightened his grip on the I-beam, the rough metal cold against his gloved hands. Dawn was just beginning to paint the eastern sky with bruised purples and oranges, but up here, perched precariously on the edge of the city's newest monument to progress, it felt like a different world entirely. A world of steel and wind and the constant, low thrum of fear that Elias had learned to live with. He wasn't afraid of heights, not exactly. It was more the knowledge of what gravity could do, the sudden, terrifying plummet that awaited any misstep. Today, that knowledge felt sharper, heavier, like a physical weight in his gut.  He hadn't slept well, plagued by a dream he couldn't quite recall, leaving him with a lingering sense of unease. He chalked it up to the burnt coffee and the early hour, but the feeling persisted, clinging to him like the icy wind.
