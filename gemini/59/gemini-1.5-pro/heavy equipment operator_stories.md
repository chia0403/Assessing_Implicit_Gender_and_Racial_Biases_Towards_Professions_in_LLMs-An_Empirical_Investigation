The biting wind whipped across the vast, ochre expanse of the Mojave Desert, stinging Amelia “Milly” Reyes’s cheeks even through the thick canvas of her Carhartt jacket.  Sunrise was still a good hour away, but the floodlights mounted on her Caterpillar D10T dozer painted the desolate landscape in an eerie, artificial glow. Milly adjusted her hardhat, the beam from her headlamp catching the frosted breath puffing from her mouth.  Around her, the skeletal frames of Joshua trees clawed at the inky pre-dawn sky, their shadows stretching long and distorted across the graded earth.  Today marked the beginning of the Mojave Solar One project, a massive undertaking that would transform this barren stretch of desert into a field of gleaming solar panels.  Milly, the most experienced dozer operator in the Garcia & Sons Construction crew, had drawn the short straw, meaning she was responsible for the initial clearing and leveling – backbreaking work, especially in the unforgiving Mojave winter.  She gripped the controls, the cold steel biting into her gloved hands. The D10T rumbled to life, its powerful engine a throaty growl in the stillness, a sound both comforting and ominous in this isolated corner of the world.
