The frosted breath of November clung to the air in Hollow Creek, Oregon, a town so small its library was its beating heart. Inside, amidst the hushed whispers of turning pages and the comforting aroma of aged paper, Eleanor Vance Holloway, the town librarian, meticulously shelved a newly arrived biography of Marie Curie. The late afternoon sun cast long, skeletal shadows through the tall gothic windows, painting stripes of amber and dusk across the worn wooden floor.  A grandfather clock in the corner ticked with a measured solemnity, its pendulum swinging like a metronome keeping time for the sleepy town. Outside, the wind rattled the bare branches of the ancient oak that guarded the library's entrance, whispering tales of long-forgotten winters. Eleanor paused, her hand resting on the cool spine of a novel, a faint sense of unease prickling her skin. It wasn't the wind, nor the coming darkness, but something else, something unsettling that hummed beneath the town's usual tranquil rhythm.
