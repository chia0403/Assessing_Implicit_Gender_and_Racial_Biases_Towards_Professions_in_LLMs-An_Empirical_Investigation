Rain lashed against the attic window, a frantic drummer keeping time with the creaking of the old Victorian house.  Eleanor Vance, a writer of gothic romances with a penchant for tragically beautiful heroines and brooding, Byronic heroes, shivered, pulling her threadbare shawl tighter around her shoulders.  The single bulb dangling precariously from the raftered ceiling cast long, dancing shadows across the cluttered space.  Stacks of manuscripts, teetering precariously, threatened to engulf the small, worn writing desk where Eleanor sat hunched over her latest work-in-progress, a tale entitled "The Shadow of Blackhaven Manor."  The air, thick with the scent of dust and damp paper, hung heavy around her, punctuated by the occasional, sharp crackle of the dying embers in the fireplace. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, a fitting soundtrack to the chilling tale unfolding beneath her pen.  Ashworth, the small, isolated village nestled in the Yorkshire moors, was shrouded in a perpetual mist, a place where secrets thrived and whispers carried on the wind held more truth than any spoken word.
