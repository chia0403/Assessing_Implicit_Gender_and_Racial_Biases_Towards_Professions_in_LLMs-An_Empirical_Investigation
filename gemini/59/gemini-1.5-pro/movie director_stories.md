The biting November wind whipped off the East River, plastering Amelia "Amy" Reyes's thick, black hair across her face as she stared up at the skeletal frame of the Queensboro Bridge.  Below her, Roosevelt Island hummed with a muted energy – the distant rumble of the F train, the muffled cries of children playing in the park, the rhythmic slap of the river against the seawall.  Amy, clad in a worn leather jacket, fingerless gloves, and her trademark scarlet scarf, pulled it tighter around her neck, the vibrant color a stark contrast to the grey, pre-dawn sky.  She was perched precariously on a crumbling concrete ledge overlooking the water, a vantage point she’d discovered weeks ago while scouting locations for her next film, a gritty, independent drama about a forgotten magician and his disappearing act.  This specific shot, the bridge looming large, a symbol of connection and escape, was crucial. It had to be perfect.  And right now, it wasn’t.
