The clatter of horse-drawn carriages on cobblestones and the cries of street vendors hawking their wares drifted up to the attic window of Madame Aurelie Dubois's dressmaking salon.  Dust motes danced in the shafts of sunlight that pierced through the gaps in the heavy drapes, illuminating the chaos within.  Fabric swatches in every imaginable colour and texture lay draped over chairs, spilling from overflowing baskets, and even piled precariously on the small, chipped porcelain teacups scattered around the worktable.  Aurelie herself, her dark hair pulled back in a severe bun that threatened to unravel at any moment, knelt on the floor, surrounded by a sea of emerald green silk, muttering furiously to herself about the capricious nature of bias cuts.  The air, thick with the scent of lavender and the faintest hint of burning candle wax, hummed with the anticipation of the upcoming Grand Ball, a social event that held the potential to make or break Aurelie's already precarious reputation in the bustling, fashion-obsessed city of Bellefleur.
