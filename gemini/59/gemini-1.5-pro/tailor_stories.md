The year is 1888. A chill, tinged with the ever-present scent of coal smoke and brine, clung to the cobbled streets of Whitechapel, London.  Gas lamps flickered weakly, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to mimic the anxieties clinging to the fog. Inside a cramped shop at 17 Heneage Street, Elias Finch, needle poised mid-air, squinted at the heavy velvet curtain he was mending. The shop, "Finch & Sons, Fine Tailoring," though boasting a grand name, was little more than a single room, overflowing with bolts of cloth, half-finished garments, and the comforting chaos of a working tailor's life.  Elias, a man of compact build with hands calloused from years of working with needle and thread, sighed, the plume of his breath briefly visible in the frigid air. Business had been slow, the recent string of unsettling events in the district keeping many potential customers indoors after dark.  He pricked his finger, a bead of blood welling up, a starkly crimson counterpoint to the deep purple of the velvet. "Bloody hell," he muttered, more irritated by the interruption than the pain.  He had a deadline to meet, and the spectral presence of Jack the Ripper loomed larger than any looming debt.
