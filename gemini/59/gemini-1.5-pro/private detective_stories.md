Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of Benny's Diner, a relentless rhythm that mirrored the gnawing anxiety in Amelia "Mia" Stone's gut.  Neon signs flickered through the greasy windowpane, painting fleeting streaks of lurid colour across the worn Formica tabletop.  1950s crooners warbled from the jukebox, their saccharine melodies a stark contrast to the grim reality of the situation.  Mia, her trench coat still dripping, sat hunched over a chipped mug of lukewarm coffee, the cigarette between her fingers burning down unnoticed.  The diner, nestled in the heart of Los Angeles' grimy Bunker Hill district, was a haven for insomniacs, dreamers, and those who preferred to operate under the cloak of darkness.  Tonight, it was Mia's temporary office.  Across from her, nervously fiddling with a fedora that had seen better days, sat a man whose face spoke volumes about sleepless nights and a troubled conscience.  He was her client, and the story he was about to tell had the potential to drag Mia deeper into the city's underbelly than she'd ever been before.
