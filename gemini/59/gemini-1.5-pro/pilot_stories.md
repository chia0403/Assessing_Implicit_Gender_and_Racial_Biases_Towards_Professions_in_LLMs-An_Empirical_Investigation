The biting Alaskan wind whipped at Captain Evangeline "Eva" Moreau's parka as she prepped her De Havilland Beaver for takeoff.  The sky above the tiny, snow-dusted airstrip of Talkeetna was a bruised purple, the sun barely peeking over the jagged peaks of the Alaska Range.  Eva, her breath clouding in the frigid air, ran a gloved hand over the plane's worn red and white fuselage, a familiar ritual that offered a strange comfort amidst the isolating vastness of the Alaskan wilderness.  This was her life: ferrying supplies, tourists, and the occasional eccentric prospector to remote cabins and mining claims scattered across a landscape where roads were a luxury and the only highways were frozen rivers and the paths carved by bush pilots like herself. This morning, however, the cargo was different. Crated and secured in the back, wrapped in heavy canvas, was a mysterious shipment destined for a research outpost nestled deep within Denali National Park, a place even seasoned bush pilots like Eva approached with a healthy dose of respect and a touch of trepidation.
