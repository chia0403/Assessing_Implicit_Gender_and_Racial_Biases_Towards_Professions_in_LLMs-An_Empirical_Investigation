The biting November wind whipped at Elias Thorne's cheeks, turning them the same shade as the crimson maple leaves he was currently wrestling into a biodegradable bag.  Frost crunched under his worn work boots as he surveyed Mrs. Albright’s yard, a small but fiercely maintained kingdom of manicured hedges and perennials stubbornly clinging to their last vestiges of autumn glory in the upscale neighborhood of Oakhaven, Connecticut.  A slate-grey sky threatened snow, and the air held that distinct metallic tang that Elias had come to associate with the impending first snowfall of the year.  He adjusted the brim of his faded green cap, the logo of "Thorne's Landscape Transformations" barely visible beneath a layer of dirt and grime, and sighed.  Winter was coming, and with it, the lean months. This last job of the season – winterizing Mrs. Albright’s prize-winning rose bushes – had to be perfect.
