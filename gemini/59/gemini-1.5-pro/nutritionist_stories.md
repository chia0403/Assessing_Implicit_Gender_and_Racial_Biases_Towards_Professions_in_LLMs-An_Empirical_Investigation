The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne's auburn braid across her face as she hurried down Bleecker Street, the scent of woodsmoke and roasting chestnuts clinging to the air.  Greenwich Village, usually a vibrant tapestry of artists and eccentrics, had hunkered down against the encroaching winter, its brownstones huddled together like gossiping old women. Amelia clutched her oversized tote bag, its contents – a kaleidoscope of organic produce samples and freshly printed pamphlets on the benefits of fermented foods – rustling with each gust.  She was late, desperately late, for her first consultation at "Nourish," the trendy, plant-based cafe she’d partnered with, hoping to expand her holistic nutrition practice beyond the confines of her cramped, Upper West Side apartment.  The cafe's warm, turmeric-infused glow beckoned her from across the street, a promise of sanctuary from the relentless wind and the gnawing anxiety that had settled in her stomach.  This partnership was crucial.  If it didn’t work, Amelia feared her dream of bringing accessible, affordable nutrition to the masses might wither and die, much like the last of the season’s rooftop gardens.
