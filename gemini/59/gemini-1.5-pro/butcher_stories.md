The biting wind whipped around Elias Thorne, clinging to his thick canvas apron like a persistent ghost.  Frost rimed the cobblestones of Crowfoot Lane, and the gas lamps flickered weakly against the pre-dawn gloom of a December morning in Grimsborough.  Elias, his breath clouding the air, heaved a side of beef onto the sturdy oak chopping block outside his shop, "Thorne's Prime Cuts."  The meat landed with a dull thud, the sound swallowed by the pervasive chill.  Above him, a sign depicting a gleefully plump pig swung creakily in the wind, its painted smile somehow unsettling in the half-light.  Grimsborough was a town that woke early, driven by the rumbling bellies of its inhabitants and the ever-present scent of coal smoke and brine from the nearby docks.  Elias knew that soon, the lane would bustle with housewives clutching their meagre coin purses and dockworkers seeking a hearty breakfast. But for now, it was just him, the frost, and the looming carcass that awaited his cleaver.
