The salt spray kissed Amelia "Milly" Reyes's face as she leaned against the railing of the *Sea Serpent*, a battered but beloved ferry chugging its way towards Aisling Isle.  Jagged peaks, shrouded in mist that swirled like phantom dancers, pierced the bruised-purple sky.  The air, thick with the smell of brine and something faintly metallic, vibrated with the low thrum of the ferry's engine. Aisling Isle, a volcanic outcrop thirty miles off the coast of County Donegal, Ireland, wasn't your typical tourist destination. No sandy beaches or quaint pubs here. Just sheer cliffs, whispering caves echoing with forgotten legends, and a landscape that shifted between breathtaking beauty and stark, almost menacing, grandeur. Milly, with her wind-whipped black hair and a smile as bright as the occasional bursts of sunlight breaking through the clouds, was the only one who dared to regularly navigate these treacherous waters, guiding the handful of intrepid souls who sought Aisling's unique, untamed charm.  This trip, however, felt different. The air was heavier, the silence deeper, the mist... watching.
