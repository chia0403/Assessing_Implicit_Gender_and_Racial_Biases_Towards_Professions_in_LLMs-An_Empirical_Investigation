The fluorescent lights of Northwood High hummed a monotonous B flat, a soundtrack to Ms. Eleanor Vance’s Tuesday morning. Rain lashed against the window of her small, cluttered office, mirroring the tempest brewing in her stomach.  Diplomas from obscure online universities jostled for space on the wall with faded motivational posters featuring kittens clinging to ropes.  A half-eaten granola bar sat precariously on a stack of college applications, threatening to topple onto the overflowing recycling bin beneath. Northwood, nestled in the heart of the perpetually overcast town of Hemlock Creek, Oregon, wasn’t exactly a hotbed of Ivy League aspirations. Most students dreamt of logging, fishing, or escaping Hemlock Creek altogether, ambitions Ms. Vance understood intimately. This Tuesday, however, felt different. A strange stillness hung in the air, a premonition of something unsettling about to break the dreary routine.
