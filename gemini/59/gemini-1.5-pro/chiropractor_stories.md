The biting wind whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne as he hurried across the cobblestone street, his breath clouding the air in front of him.  Gaslights flickered, casting long, skeletal shadows that danced against the brick buildings of Grimsby, a small, perpetually overcast fishing town perched precariously on the edge of the North Sea.  The salt spray clung to everything, a constant reminder of the town's uneasy truce with the unforgiving ocean. It was late November, and the festive cheer that usually preceded Christmas was conspicuously absent this year.  A heavy sense of foreboding hung over Grimsby, thicker than the sea fog that often rolled in, obscuring the harbor and swallowing the fishing boats whole. Elias pulled his collar higher, the chill seeping into his bones, and quickened his pace towards the warm glow emanating from his chiropractic clinic, "The Spinal Sanctuary," nestled between a fishmonger and a rather dilapidated pub called "The Crooked Crab." He had a late appointment, and a strange feeling in the pit of his stomach told him it wasn't going to be a typical adjustment.
