The relentless Miami sun beat down on the turquoise yoga mats spread across the rooftop terrace of the Azure Breeze condominium complex.  Salt-laced air, thick with the promise of an afternoon thunderstorm, whipped strands of Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez's dark hair across her face.  She tucked the errant strands behind her ear, her bright smile unwavering as she surveyed the twenty expectant faces staring up at her.  Below, the Art Deco pastels of South Beach shimmered in the heat haze, a vibrant backdrop to Amy's outdoor fitness empire.  It was 7:00 AM, and another "Sunrise Sculpt and Flow" class was about to begin.  Amy, clad in electric blue leggings and a matching sports bra, adjusted her headset microphone. "Good morning, beautiful people!" she chirped, her voice amplified across the rooftop. "Ready to sweat?"  A chorus of enthusiastic, albeit slightly sleepy, affirmations met her.  But Amy noticed a new face amongst her regulars â€“ a man with steely grey eyes and a posture that screamed ex-military, standing stiffly at the back.  He didn't smile back.
