The biting wind whipped around Elias Thorne's ankles as he wrestled with the rusted shut-off valve behind Mrs. Periwinkle's prize-winning rhododendrons.  Frost crunched beneath his steel-toed boots, and the December air, sharp and clean, carried the faint scent of pine from the nearby woods.  Nestled in the heart of the Catskill Mountains, the small town of Hemlock Hollow was picture-postcard perfect, especially draped in its winter finery.  But Elias, his knuckles raw and his breath clouding in the frigid air, found little charm in it at that moment.  He’d much prefer to be back in his warm workshop, the scent of solder and flux replacing the icy bite of winter.  This emergency call – a burst pipe in the Periwinkle’s guest bathroom, no less – had dragged him out on what was supposed to be his first day off in weeks.  Hemlock Hollow might be idyllic, but its plumbing, like much else in a town pushing a century old, was notoriously temperamental.
