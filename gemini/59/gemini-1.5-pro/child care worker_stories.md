The fluorescent lights of the "Little Wonders Daycare" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Rose Hawthorne's life. Rain lashed against the windows, turning the grey November afternoon into something resembling twilight.  Inside, the air thrummed with the chaotic energy only a room full of toddlers could produce.  Building blocks clattered, tiny voices shrieked with laughter and the pungent aroma of apple sauce hung in the air.  Amelia, perched on a miniature chair surrounded by a fortress of stuffed animals, patiently coaxed little Leo, a cherubic-faced two-year-old with a surprisingly strong grip, to release his ironclad hold on her braid.  The daycare, nestled in a converted Victorian house in the sleepy town of Oakhaven, Oregon, usually felt like a haven, but today, a strange sense of unease prickled at Amelia's skin. The wind howled outside, rattling the old windowpanes, and the shadows in the corners of the room seemed deeper, more ominous than usual.
