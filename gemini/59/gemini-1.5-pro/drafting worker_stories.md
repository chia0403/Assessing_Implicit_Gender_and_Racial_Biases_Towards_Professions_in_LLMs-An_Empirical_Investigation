The fluorescent lights of Henderson & Sons Architectural Design hummed a monotonous B flat over Elias Thorne’s head.  It was a sound he’d initially found irritating, then tolerable, and now, after five years, barely noticed. Outside, the Chicago wind howled against the plate glass windows of the 42nd floor, promising snow flurries later that evening. Elias, hunched over his drafting table, meticulously rendered the cross-section of a load-bearing wall for the new North Shore library, his 2H pencil whispering against the vellum.  The only other sound in his small, cluttered cubicle was the rhythmic click of his mechanical pencil as he extended the lead.  Dust motes danced in the cones of light cast by his desk lamp, illuminating the blueprints, templates, and meticulously sharpened pencils that were the tools of his trade.  This was Elias’s world, a world of precise lines, exacting measurements, and the silent satisfaction of bringing architectural visions to life, one painstaking detail at a time.  He wasn't the architect, not the visionary, but he was the one who made sure the vision could stand. And for Elias, that was enough, at least, it had been until this morning.
