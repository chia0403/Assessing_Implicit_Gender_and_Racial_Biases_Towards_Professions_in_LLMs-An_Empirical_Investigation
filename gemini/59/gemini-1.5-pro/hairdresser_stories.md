The rusty whir of the ceiling fan did little to dispel the thick, sweet scent of hairspray hanging in the air of Shear Perfection. Rain hammered against the large front window, blurring the neon "Open" sign and the view of Magnolia Street in downtown Harmony, Mississippi.  Thirty-two-year-old  Clementine Rose Dupree, her name stitched in cursive on her cerulean smock, sighed and wiped a stray curl from her forehead with the back of her hand.  Tuesdays were usually slow, but this one was shaping up to be a real snoozer. The only other person in the salon was Mrs. Henderson, a permanent fixture under the dryer, her gossip magazines scattered around her like fallen autumn leaves.  Clementine glanced at the clock – 2:17 pm.  Plenty of time for something interesting to walk through the door. Or, more likely, plenty of time for Clementine to finish her embroidery project – a rather ambitious depiction of a peacock feather destined for her mama’s birthday cushion.
