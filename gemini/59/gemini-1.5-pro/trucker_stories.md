The neon "Truck Stop Diner" sign buzzed erratically, casting a sickly green glow over the rain-slicked asphalt.  Diesel fumes mingled with the scent of frying onions and stale coffee, a perfume Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez had come to associate with home.  Not a brick-and-mortar home, mind you, but the transient kind found in the cabs of eighteen-wheelers and the booths of roadside eateries like this one, somewhere on the desolate stretch of I-70 cutting through western Kansas.  Wind howled outside, whipping the rain into a frenzy against the diner's windows, and Amy, her knuckles white around a chipped mug of lukewarm coffee, watched as another gust nearly ripped the "Open 24 Hours" sign clean off its hinges.  It was going to be a long night.
