The scent of burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the usually sweet perfume of Amelia Rose Hawthorne's bakery, "Sugar & Bloom."

Tipped over bowls of buttercream, scattered sprinkles resembling confetti after a disastrous party, and a half-finished, three-tiered wedding cake listing precariously to one side, all painted a picture of baking gone very, very wrong. Outside, the usually charming cobblestone streets of Willow Creek, Vermont, shimmered under the relentless July sun, oblivious to the catastrophe unfolding within the quaint, pastel-pink storefront.  The grand opening of Sugar & Bloom, Ameliaâ€™s lifelong dream, was just two days away, and right now, it looked more like the scene of a sugar-fueled riot than the charming bakery she had envisioned.
