The salt spray kissed Elara Thistlewick's face as she perched precariously on the cliff edge, her easel braced against the wind. Below, the churning turquoise waters of the Aegean Sea crashed against the volcanic rock of Santorini. The whitewashed houses of Oia, clinging to the caldera's rim like barnacles, glowed in the late afternoon sun, their blue domes reflecting the vibrant sky.  Elara, her fingers stained with cerulean and alizarin crimson, squinted, trying to capture the exact shade of lavender that kissed the distant islands as the sun began its descent. The air, thick with the scent of brine and wild thyme, buzzed with the promise of a spectacular sunset â€“ the kind that painters travelled thousands of miles to witness, the kind that Elara hoped, desperately, to finally capture on canvas. This was her third attempt this week, and the pressure, both from the wind and her own self-doubt, was mounting.
