The velvet curtains of the dilapidated Grand Majestic Theatre, their crimson faded to the dusky hue of a dried blood orange, whispered against each other in the draft.  Dust motes, disturbed by the single bare bulb swinging precariously above the stage, danced in the anemic light.  This was Penelope Iris Featherstonehaugh's kingdom, or at least what was left of it.  Once the jewel of the Borscht Belt, the Grand Majestic had fallen on hard times, mirroring Penelope’s own fortunes.  Nestled amidst the now-shuttered bungalows and decaying hotels of the Catskills in upstate New York, it clung to existence like a stubborn weed pushing through cracked asphalt.  Tonight, amidst the peeling paint and the ghosts of vaudeville acts past, Penelope faced her most challenging opening night yet – not a performance, but a fight for the theatre's very survival.
