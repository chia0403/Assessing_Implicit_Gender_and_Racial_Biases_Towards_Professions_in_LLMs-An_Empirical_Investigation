The revolving doors of the Grand Majestic Hotel whispered a sigh of cool air into the stifling July heat of New Orleans.  Brass gleamed, marble shone, and the scent of lilies and old money hung heavy in the lobby. This was Elias Finch's domain.  Dressed in a crisp, scarlet uniform with gold braiding, Elias, whose full name was Elias Beaumont Finch III, navigated the opulent space with the practiced ease of a seasoned conductor leading an orchestra.  He was a master of the subtle arts of the bell hop â€“ anticipating needs before they were voiced, conjuring taxis from thin air, and carrying impossibly heavy luggage with a disarming smile. But beneath the polished veneer and effortless charm, Elias harbored a secret, one as tangled and mysterious as the Spanish moss draped over the ancient oaks in the nearby City Park. He wasn't just a bell hop; he was a collector of stories, and the Grand Majestic, with its cast of eccentric guests and hidden histories, was his most prized collection yet.
