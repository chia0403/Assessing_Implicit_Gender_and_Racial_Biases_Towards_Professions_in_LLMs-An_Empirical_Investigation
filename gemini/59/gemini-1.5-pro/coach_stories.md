The biting wind whipped across the cracked asphalt of the St. Ignatius High School parking lot, carrying the scent of stale beer and trampled dreams. Coach Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez huddled deeper into her worn Trojans jacket, her breath puffing out in white clouds that quickly dissipated in the November air. Floodlights cast long, skeletal shadows from the bleachers, illuminating the empty field where, only hours earlier, her team, the once-mighty Trojans, had suffered their most humiliating defeat in a decade.  The scoreboard, still starkly displaying the lopsided score of 42-7, felt like a tombstone marking the end of an era. St. Ignatius, nestled in the forgotten corner of Rust Belt Ohio, had always been a football town, a place where Friday nights were sacred and the roar of the crowd fueled the town's flickering spirit. But tonight, the silence was deafening.  Amy felt the weight of the town's disappointment settle heavily on her shoulders, as heavy as the icy rain that now began to fall.
