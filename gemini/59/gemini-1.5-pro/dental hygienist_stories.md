The relentless Oregon rain hammered against the window of "Smile Brighter Dental," blurring the neon pink toothbrush in the logo. Inside, the air smelled sterile, a crisp mix of antiseptic and mint.  Eliza Jane Bellweather, a woman whose perpetually cheerful demeanor seemed immune to even the dreariest of Pacific Northwest days, hummed along to the eighties power ballad blasting softly from the radio, meticulously polishing the stainless steel instruments.

Her first patient, Mrs. Henderson, was always prompt.  A prickle of unease, as sharp and cold as the rain outside, began to tap at the edges of Eliza’s usually sunny disposition.  Something felt…off.
