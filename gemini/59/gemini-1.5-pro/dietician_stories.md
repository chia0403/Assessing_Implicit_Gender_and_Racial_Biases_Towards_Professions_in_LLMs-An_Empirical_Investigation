The insistent California sun, a relentless glare even at 7:00 am, bounced off the chrome and glass facade of the "Nourish" clinic, temporarily blinding Dr. Eleanor Vance.  She shielded her eyes with a hand, a small sigh escaping her lips. Palm Springs in August felt like living inside a toaster oven, and even her meticulously chosen linen dress offered little respite. Eleanor, whose full name was Eleanor Rosalind Vance, adjusted the strap of her oversized tote bag, its contents – a laptop, client files, and a suspiciously squashed peach – a testament to her dedication.  Nourish, her own private practice specializing in holistic nutrition, was nestled amidst a cluster of upscale boutiques and art galleries on Palm Canyon Drive. It was a far cry from the sterile hospital environment she’d initially envisioned for her career, but the desert, with its surprising bounty of fresh produce and health-conscious clientele, had slowly woven its spell. Today, however, a prickly sense of unease prickled beneath Eleanor’s usually calm exterior.  Mrs. Albright, a notoriously difficult client obsessed with esoteric detox regimes, was due any minute, and Eleanor had a sneaking suspicion that their session would be anything but nourishing.
