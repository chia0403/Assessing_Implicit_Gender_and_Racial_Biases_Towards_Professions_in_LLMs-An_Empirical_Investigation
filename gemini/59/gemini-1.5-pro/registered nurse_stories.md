The biting November wind whipped around Eleanor Vance, RN, as she hurried across the cracked asphalt of the St. Jude’s Hospital parking lot.  Fluorescent lights buzzed behind the grimy windows of the aging brick building, casting a sickly yellow glow on the freshly fallen snow.

Tonight, however, the usual quiet hum of the small-town hospital was replaced by a palpable tension.  Ambulances screamed in the distance, their flashing lights painting the snowdrifts an eerie red and blue.  Eleanor’s gut clenched. This wasn’t just a typical Friday night in Havenwood. Something was wrong.  Very wrong.
