The flickering fluorescent lights of the Zenith BioTech research wing buzzed like trapped insects, casting long, skeletal shadows across the polished linoleum floor. It was 3:17 am, the quietest hour in the building, and the only sound besides the hum of the lights was the rhythmic squeak of the mop being pushed by Elias Finch. Elias, his name tag slightly askew on his faded blue uniform, was a man of simple routines and quiet observation. Tonight, however, the routine felt different. A prickling unease danced on the edges of his awareness, a subtle discord in the usual symphony of silence.  The air, normally sterile and cold, held a faint, coppery tang that Elias couldn't quite place.  He paused by a closed laboratory door, labelled "Project Nightingale," the metallic scent strongest here.  The small window inset in the door was dark, obscuring whatever lay within.  Elias frowned, a wrinkle appearing on his forehead above his tired, brown eyes. He knew he shouldn't pry, but something felt wrong, profoundly wrong.
