Rain lashed against the arched windows of Genevieve "Gen" Dubois's atelier, blurring the Parisian cityscape into a hazy impressionist painting. Her studio, nestled on a quiet side street just a stone’s throw from the bustling Marais district, was a sanctuary of vibrant colours and eclectic textures.  Velvet drapes in jewel tones draped across antique dress forms, while bolts of silk and linen spilled from overflowing baskets. The air hummed with the low thrum of a jazz record playing on a vintage gramophone, momentarily drowned out by the insistent downpour. Gen, perched precariously on a ladder, adjusted a shimmering chandelier crafted from repurposed vintage perfume bottles.  Her paint-splattered overalls, a stark contrast to the opulent surroundings, couldn't disguise her inherent elegance, a mix of Parisian chic and bohemian flair.  Today, however, Gen wasn’t focused on her latest design project.  A crumpled letter lay on her workbench, its edges darkened by the rainwater that had seeped in through the open window.  The return address, barely legible beneath the smudged ink, sent a chill down her spine – Château de Valois, a place she hadn't thought about in years.
