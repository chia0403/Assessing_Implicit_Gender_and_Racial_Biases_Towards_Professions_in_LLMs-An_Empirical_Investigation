The flickering fluorescent lights of the Grand Majestic Hotel lobby buzzed like trapped insects, a soundtrack Elara Grace Hawthorne had grown accustomed to over her three years as the hotel's receptionist.  The Grand Majestic wasn't exactly grand, and its majesty had faded sometime around the Nixon administration, judging by the avocado-green rotary phone still perched on her mahogany desk. Outside, the relentless Miami sun beat down on Ocean Drive, baking the art deco facades of South Beach. Inside, the air conditioning struggled to combat the humidity, leaving a perpetual sheen of dampness on the faded velvet armchairs in the waiting area.  Elara, however, remained impeccably composed, her crisp white blouse unwrinkled, her dark hair pulled back into a neat chignon.  This Wednesday morning started like any other, with the promise of mundane paperwork and the occasional bewildered tourist needing directions to the nearest Cuban sandwich shop. Little did she know, this Wednesday was about to become anything but ordinary.
