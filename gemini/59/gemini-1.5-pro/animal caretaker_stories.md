The biting wind whipped across the salt-crusted cliffs of Ailsa Craig, tugging at Elara Thistlewick’s thick woolen scarf.  The sky, a bruised purple-grey, mirrored the churning waters of the Firth of Clyde below.  Ailsa Craig, a volcanic plug jutting dramatically from the sea, was home to the largest gannetry in the world, and Elara, the island’s sole human resident and caretaker, braced herself against the gale, the raucous cries of tens of thousands of seabirds echoing in her ears.  Her small, whitewashed cottage, perched precariously close to the cliff edge, offered little respite from the elements.  Inside, a peat fire crackled merrily in the hearth, casting dancing shadows on the worn, wooden furniture.  But Elara wasn't inside, not yet.  She was out on the cliff path, her weathered face etched with concern, searching for a flash of white against the darkening sky – a flash that belonged to a very special gannet she’d named Cirrus.
