Rain lashed against the arched window of Elias Thorne’s attic apartment, mirroring the tempest brewing inside him.  Loose manuscript pages, victims of a particularly violent gust, swirled around his worn leather armchair like frantic, papery moths.  Elias, a man whose usual composure could be likened to a well-bound first edition, swore under his breath, scooping up the scattered sheets.  His apartment, perched atop a crumbling brownstone in the heart of Greenwich Village, normally offered a sanctuary from the chaos of New York City. But tonight, even the comforting scent of old books and pipe tobacco couldn't soothe the gnawing unease that had taken root in his gut. The manuscript, a promising debut novel by a young author he'd championed, was proving to be more challenging than anticipated. It wasn't the writing itself – lyrical and evocative – but a subtle, unsettling dissonance that permeated the narrative, a sense of something… off.  The clock on the mantelpiece chimed midnight, a mournful clang in the otherwise silent apartment.  Deadline loomed, and Elias knew he had a long night ahead.
