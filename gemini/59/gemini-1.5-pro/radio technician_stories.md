The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of Nevada, whistling a mournful tune through the rusted guy-wires of the colossal KTOT radio tower.  Amelia “Amy” Reyes, her breath clouding the frigid air, tightened the straps of her heavy backpack and trudged the last few yards towards the squat, cinderblock building at the tower’s base.

Inside, the antiquated transmitter that broadcast KTOT’s signal across hundreds of miles of empty desert awaited her attention, humming a low, insistent thrum that vibrated through the frozen ground.  It was December 21st, the shortest day of the year, and Amy, the sole technician for KTOT, had a sinking feeling it was going to be a long one.
