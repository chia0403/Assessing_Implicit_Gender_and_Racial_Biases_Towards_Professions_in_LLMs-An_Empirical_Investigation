The rusty scissors, affectionately nicknamed Snippy by Elias Thorne, snicked rhythmically in the humid air of the Honeysuckle Hair Emporium.  Elias, a man whose neatly trimmed salt-and-pepper beard mirrored the precise lines he crafted on his clients’ heads, stood bathed in the warm glow of the setting sun that streamed through the large, west-facing window. Dust motes danced in the golden light, illuminating the faded floral wallpaper and the rows of half-empty product bottles lining the worn wooden shelves.  Honeysuckle, Alabama, was a town that clung stubbornly to the past, a place where time seemed to move slower, measured in the gentle whir of ceiling fans and the slow drip of sweet tea from sweating pitchers. The Emporium, nestled between a dilapidated hardware store and Miss Edna's perpetually busy bakery, was a perfect reflection of the town itself: a little worn around the edges, but full of character and quiet charm.  This Tuesday evening, however, held a different kind of quiet, a stillness that prickled Elias’s skin and hinted at something more than just the usual sleepy summer lull.
