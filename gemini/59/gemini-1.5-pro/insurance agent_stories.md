Rain lashed against the stained-glass window depicting St. Jude, patron saint of lost causes, a fitting image given Elias Thorne’s current predicament.  He sat in his cramped office above Mrs. Higgins’ perpetually dusty antique shop, the scent of mothballs and damp wool clinging to the air like a shroud.  Pendleton, Oregon, population barely fifteen thousand, wasn't exactly a booming metropolis, and on this particularly dreary Tuesday afternoon in November, it felt smaller, more suffocating than ever. Elias Thorne, a man whose neatly pressed suits and polished shoes belied his dwindling bank account, stared at the overdue notice from his landlord, the faded floral wallpaper offering no solace.  His once thriving insurance business, "Thorne's Shield of Security," was rapidly becoming less a shield and more a sieve, leaking clients faster than a rusty pipe.  The problem wasn't a lack of diligence; Elias was nothing if not meticulous. The problem was Pendleton itself. Nothing exciting, nothing disastrous, ever seemed to happen here.  And in the insurance business, monotony was the enemy of profit.
