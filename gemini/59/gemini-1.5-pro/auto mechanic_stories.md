The biting November wind whipped across the cracked asphalt of the Texaco station, stinging Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez's cheeks even through the grease smudged across them.  Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the chaotic scene below: a rusted-out Ford pickup perched precariously on a jack, a spilled can of brake fluid forming a shimmering puddle, and Amy herself, half-buried under the truck's hood, muttering darkly about stripped bolts. The Pep Boys Auto Parts across the street blared Christmas music – a tinny rendition of "Jingle Bells" –  a stark contrast to the desolate landscape of Route 66 just outside Flagstaff, Arizona, where tumbleweeds danced across the highway and the only other signs of life were the occasional semi-truck rumbling past and the flickering neon sign of the Desert Rose Motel next door.
