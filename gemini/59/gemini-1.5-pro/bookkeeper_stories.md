The insistent drumming of rain against the corrugated iron roof of Abernathy & Sons General Store was Amelia Grace Holloway's least favorite kind of music.  It meant damp ledgers, ink that bled like a wounded soldier, and the pervasive smell of wet wool emanating from the shop's dwindling stock of winter coats. Dustbowl, Oklahoma, in 1935 wasn't exactly a thriving metropolis, and the persistent drought had only been interrupted by these sudden, torrential downpours that did more harm than good.  Amelia, perched on her high stool behind the oak counter that served as her office, sighed and meticulously blotted the latest entry in the accounts book â€“ a paltry sum for a sack of flour and a tin of beans. The store's bell jingled, announcing a customer, but Amelia didn't look up.  She already knew who it was. The rhythm of the footsteps, slow and deliberate, belonged to only one man in Dustbowl.
