The clang of a dropped stockpot echoed through the cavernous kitchen of The Gilded Spoon, rattling the mismatched collection of copper pans hanging from the ceiling.  Amelia “Amy”  Rodriguez winced, not at the noise, but at the thought of Chef Gaston’s reaction.  It was 5:30 a.m., the pre-dawn light barely filtering through the grimy windows onto the stainless steel surfaces, and already the air hung thick with the mingled scents of garlic, burnt coffee, and impending stress. The Gilded Spoon wasn't exactly gilded, and the spoons were decidedly standard-issue stainless, but it was Amy’s kitchen, her domain, her battleground against culinary chaos.  Located in the heart of the French Quarter of New Orleans, the restaurant pulsed with the city's eccentric rhythm – a blend of old-world charm and barely-controlled pandemonium, much like Amy’s signature gumbo.
