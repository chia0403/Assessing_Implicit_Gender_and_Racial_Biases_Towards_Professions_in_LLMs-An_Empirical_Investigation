The biting wind whipped down from the Dragon's Tooth peaks, carrying the scent of pine and the whisper of approaching snow.  Elias Thorne, his calloused hands tucked deep into his sheepskin-lined coat, surveyed the quarry.  Grey granite, veined with quartz that shimmered like trapped starlight, rose around him in jagged tiers, monuments to the earth's ancient upheavals. Here, nestled high in the Wilderfell Valley, where the air was thin and the shadows long, Elias plied his solitary trade. He was a stone cutter, a shaper of the mountain's heart, a man as weathered and resolute as the rock he worked.  His small cabin, built from scavenged timber and chinked with clay, clung precariously to the quarry's edge, a fragile haven against the elements.  The first flakes of snow began to fall, dusting the granite with a fleeting coat of white.  A raven croaked from a nearby pine, a harsh counterpoint to the wind's mournful song. This morning, Elias felt a disquiet he couldnâ€™t name, a prickling sense of anticipation that had nothing to do with the coming winter.
