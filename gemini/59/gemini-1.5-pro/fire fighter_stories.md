The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Mia" Rodriguez's hair across her face as she stood on the precipice of Miller's Quarry, the abandoned granite pit yawning like a toothless maw below.  Rusty chains, remnants of long-gone quarrying equipment, creaked in the wind, their mournful song echoing off the sheer rock walls.  Pine trees clung precariously to the quarry's rim, their branches skeletal against the bruised twilight sky.  Mia, bundled in her thick firefighting jacket, felt the cold seep through to her bones despite the layers. The call had come in just ten minutes ago: a possible brush fire sparked by downed power lines, threatening the dry undergrowth surrounding the abandoned quarry.  Usually, this kind of call would be handled by the forestry service, but with them stretched thin fighting a larger blaze further north, Mia and her crew from Engine 5 were the first responders.  The air was thick with the scent of pine needles and something else, something acrid and unsettling, that hinted at more than just a small brush fire.
