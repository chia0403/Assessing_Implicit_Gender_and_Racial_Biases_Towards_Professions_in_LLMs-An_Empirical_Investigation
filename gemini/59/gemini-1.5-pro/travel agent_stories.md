The chipped ceramic flamingo on Evangeline "Effie" Periwinkle's desk stared placidly across the cluttered office, oblivious to the miniature blizzard raging outside. Fat snowflakes plastered themselves against the window of "Effie's Escapes," obscuring the typically grey January sky above downtown Portland, Oregon. Effie, however, was dreaming of turquoise waters and white sand beaches, a stark contrast to the slushy reality just beyond the glass.  She tapped a manicured nail against a brochure boasting "All-Inclusive Luxury in the Maldives," a faint sigh escaping her lips.  The travel agency was quiet this afternoon, the only sound the rhythmic click-clack of her keyboard and the occasional muffled rumble of a passing MAX train.  It was the kind of quiet that usually allowed Effie's mind to wander to exotic locales, crafting bespoke itineraries for clients she hadn't even met yet.  But today, the silence was heavy, punctuated by the unspoken worry that this blizzard might be the final nail in the coffin for her struggling business.
