The biting November wind whipped around Agnes Periwinkle, tugging at the edges of her starched white apron as she wrestled the heavy oak door of Athelney Manor closed.  Dead leaves, the color of rust and old pennies, swirled across the gravel drive like miniature dervishes. Athelney Manor, perched high on the windswept Yorkshire moors, was a brooding gothic masterpiece of grey stone and leaded glass, a place of shadows even on the brightest of days.  Today, under a sky the colour of bruised plums, it felt particularly forbidding. Agnes, however, was undeterred. Thirty years she’d been housekeeper here, and the manor, with all its creaks, groans, and whispered secrets, was more home to her than anywhere else ever had been.  She stamped her sensible shoes on the worn flagstones of the entrance hall, dispelling the lingering chill with a brisk rub of her hands, then proceeded to methodically check that all the bolts and locks were securely fastened for the night.  Mr. Silas Blackwood, the manor’s eccentric owner, was away in London, and Agnes was left in sole charge, a responsibility she took with utmost seriousness.
