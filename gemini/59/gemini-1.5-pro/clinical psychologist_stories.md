The rain, a relentless Seattle drizzle, slicked the cobblestones of Pioneer Square, reflecting the neon glow of the Smith Tower back onto the wet pavement. Dr. Eleanor Vance, Psy.D., hurried through the downpour, her trench coat flapping around her ankles.  Inside the warmth of her office, nestled above a dimly lit jazz club on Jackson Street, the scent of old books and brewing Earl Grey tea hung heavy in the air. The ticking grandfather clock in the corner, a gift from her late grandmother, seemed to amplify the silence that settled after Eleanor closed and locked the heavy oak door behind her. This was her sanctuary, a place where the anxieties of her patients were dissected and hopefully, eventually, soothed. Tonight, however, the quiet hummed with a different kind of tension, a personal unease that had been growing within Eleanor for weeks, clinging to her like the damp Seattle air.
