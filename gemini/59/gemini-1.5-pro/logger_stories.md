The biting November wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the towering Douglas firs, whistling a mournful tune that echoed the gnawing emptiness in Jedediah "Jed" Blackwood's belly.  Dawn hadn't yet broken over the Cascade foothills, but Jed was already halfway up the logging road, the worn tires of his battered Ford F-150 crunching on the frost-covered gravel.  The air, crisp and clean with the scent of pine and damp earth, usually invigorated him. But not today. Today, the cold seemed to seep into his very bones, a chilling reminder of the dwindling days left in the logging season and the ever-present threat of the mill closing down for good in the small, isolated town of Timber Creek, Oregon.
