The aroma of burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a bittersweet perfume clinging to the faded floral wallpaper of Buttercup Bakery.  Elara Thistlewick, her flour-dusted apron askew and a smudge of chocolate on her cheek, sighed.

Elaraâ€™s famous gingerbread cookies, usually a guaranteed mood booster, lay charred on the baking tray, a testament to her distracted state. Her grandmother's recipe book, normally open on the worn wooden counter, lay closed, its secrets momentarily forgotten. Something was different in Port Blossom this year, a subtle shift in the familiar rhythm of the seaside town, and Elara, with her baker's intuition as sensitive as a well-proofed dough, could feel it in her bones.
