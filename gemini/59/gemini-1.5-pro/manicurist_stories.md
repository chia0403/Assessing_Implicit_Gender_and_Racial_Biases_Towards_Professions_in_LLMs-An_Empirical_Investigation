The bell above the door of "Nailed It," a tiny salon squeezed between a laundromat and a perpetually closed-down bakery, chimed a discordant welcome. Rain lashed against the large front window, blurring the already fading "Grand Opening" sign taped inside.  Eliza Jane Peterson, her name tag slightly askew on her crisp pink uniform, sighed and looked up from the half-finished French manicure she was meticulously applying to Mrs. Henderson, a woman whose gossip was as sharp as her acrylics.  The salon, Eliza Jane's dream and her entire life savings, had been open for three weeks, and the only steady customers seemed to be Mrs. Henderson and the occasional bewildered tourist seeking refuge from the relentless Seattle drizzle. The air inside smelled of acetone, sugar scrub, and a faint, persistent odor of burnt coffee, a testament to Eliza Janeâ€™s disastrous attempts at operating the small coffee machine in the corner.  Outside, the grey sky pressed down on the city like a damp cloth, mirroring the weight of worry settling on Eliza Jane's shoulders.
