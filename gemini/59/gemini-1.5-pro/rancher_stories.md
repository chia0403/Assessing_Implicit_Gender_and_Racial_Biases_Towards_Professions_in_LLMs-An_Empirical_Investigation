The wind, a constant companion in this part of Montana, whipped at Elias Thorne's weathered face, tugging at the brim of his Stetson.  He squinted, the late afternoon sun a molten orange ball dipping towards the jagged peaks of the Bitterroot Range.

The cattle were skittish, the river ran low, and a strange tension hung in the air, thick and heavy as the coming storm clouds gathering on the horizon.
