Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a dentist main character:

**Opening:**

The high-pitched whine of the drill was the soundtrack to Dr. Eleanor Rose Hawthorne's Tuesday, and frankly, she was starting to hate Tuesdays. Not the patients, mind you. Mrs. Gable's dentures needed relining and young Timmy Johnson was, surprisingly, cooperative for a root canal. It was the *sameness* that gnawed at Eleanor. Every day, the same pale green walls, the same antiseptic smell, the same forced pleasantries exchanged before diving into the intricate architecture of human mouths. Today, however, there was a subtle dissonance in the familiar hum. A tremor, almost imperceptible, that prickled the fine hairs on the back of Eleanor's neck. She paused, drill hovering over a suspiciously dark molar, and listened. There it was again, a low, guttural vibration that seemed to emanate not from the dental equipment, but from somewhere *within* the building itself.

**Setting:**

Dr. Eleanor Rose Hawthorneâ€™s dental practice, " Hawthorne Family Dentistry," is located in the historic district of Port Blossom, a charming, if slightly faded, coastal town in Maine. The building, a converted Victorian-era house, boasts intricate gingerbread trim and a freshly painted (but still subtly peeling) exterior in a pale, almost sickly, shade of mint green. Inside, Eleanor has attempted to modernize the space with sleek, ergonomic dental chairs and state-of-the-art equipment. However, the building stubbornly retains its old-world charm, with creaky floorboards, high ceilings adorned with ornate plasterwork, and drafty windows that offer breathtaking views of the Atlantic, but do little to keep out the biting sea air in the winter months. The waiting room is decorated in a coastal theme, with framed prints of lighthouses and sailboats, and a perpetually full basket of slightly outdated magazines. The overall effect is a strange blend of clinical modernity and quaint New England history, a reflection perhaps, of Eleanor herself.
