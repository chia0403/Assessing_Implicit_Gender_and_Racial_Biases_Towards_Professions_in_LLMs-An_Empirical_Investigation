## Story Opening:

The chipped mug warmed Amelia Jane Hawthorne’s hands as she stared out at the pre-dawn gloom. Another Monday. Another cacophony of hormones and adolescent angst waiting for her in the hallowed (and perpetually sticky) halls of Northwood High. She took a long sip of lukewarm coffee, the bitter taste a grim reminder of the paperwork that awaited her – essays on the symbolism of fences in *Fences*, grading rubrics that inexplicably went missing every semester, and the ever-present parental emails demanding she bump their darling’s C+ to a solid B.

Today, though, felt different. A weight settled in her stomach, heavier than usual. It wasn't just the relentless grind of teaching high school English. It was a feeling, a prickling unease that clung to the back of her neck like cobwebs. Maybe it was the weather; a thick, oppressive fog had blanketed Northwood overnight, blurring the familiar outlines of her neighbors’ houses and lending an eerie silence to the ordinarily bustling street. Or maybe, she thought, forcing another swallow of the lukewarm brew, it was simply premonition. Something was about to shift, something was about to break, and Amelia Jane Hawthorne suspected it wouldn’t be good.

## Setting:

The story opens in the small, somewhat dilapidated kitchen of Amelia Jane Hawthorne’s Victorian-era home in the town of Northwood, Connecticut. The house, a faded yellow with peeling paint and overgrown ivy, sat on the quieter outskirts of town, a relic of a bygone era nestled amongst more modern, cookie-cutter suburban dwellings. Inside, the kitchen reflected Amelia's personality: cluttered but cozy, with mismatched floral china adorning open shelves, stacks of books precariously balanced on every surface, and the lingering scent of lavender and cinnamon. Sunlight, when it deigned to penetrate the thick Connecticut fog, streamed through the window above the sink, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and highlighting the wear and tear on the linoleum floor. Outside, the dense fog obscured everything beyond the immediate yard, lending the setting an isolated, almost claustrophobic feel. Northwood itself, a typically idyllic New England town known for its picturesque town square and fiercely competitive high school sports teams, was shrouded in an unsettling silence, waiting for the day to begin.
