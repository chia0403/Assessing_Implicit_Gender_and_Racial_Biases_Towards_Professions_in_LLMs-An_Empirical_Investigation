**Setting:**

The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, turning the already gray Chicago sky a menacing steel. It was late November, the kind of day that made even the hardiest Chicagoans huddle deeper into their coats and dream of warmer climes. The streetlights, already glowing weakly against the encroaching dusk, illuminated swirling snowflakes that danced across the gritty sidewalks.

But even as the words left her lips, a knot of unease tightened in her stomach. It wasn't just the dreary weather that was getting to her. Lately, things had been… off. Patients canceling at the last minute, dwindling referrals, and the constant, nagging fear that the city, with its shiny new mega-clinics, was slowly squeezing the life out of her little piece of the American dream. This November wind, she thought, felt an awful lot like the chill of failure nipping at her heels.
