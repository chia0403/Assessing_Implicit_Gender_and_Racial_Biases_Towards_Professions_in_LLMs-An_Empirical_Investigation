## Story Opening:

The beige walls of the waiting room seemed to pulse with a nervous energy, mirroring the jittery flutter in Bartholomew "Bart" Finch's stomach. He’d told himself a hundred times that this was just another appointment, another potential client, another step towards his yearly quota. But this felt different. This felt heavy. 

Bart tapped his neatly polished brown wingtips against the linoleum, the rhythmic click echoing in the otherwise silent room. He checked his watch again: 2:58 PM. Two more minutes until Mr. and Mrs. Abernathy were scheduled to arrive. He tugged at his tie, a muted paisley that he hoped conveyed both competence and approachable trustworthiness. He needed to project confidence, even if he felt like he was teetering on the edge of a cliff.

The Abernathys weren't seeking just any insurance. They were seeking life insurance. And not just a small policy, no. Mrs. Abernathy, during their initial phone conversation, had emphasized the 'substantial' nature of their needs. It was that word – 'substantial' – that had been gnawing at Bart ever since. It hinted at wealth, yes, but also at something more profound, something...final.

He smoothed down his thinning, sandy-colored hair, feeling the sweat prickle his forehead. Two minutes. He could do this. He had to. He was Bartholomew Finch, Senior Insurance Agent at Golden Shield Assurance, and he was good at his job. Mostly. He just hoped that today, 'mostly' would be enough.

## Setting:

The waiting room was located in the Golden Shield Assurance office in the small, sleepy town of Willow Creek, Ohio. The building itself was a squat, brick structure, a testament to the town's pragmatic and unpretentious nature. Inside, the decor was intentionally bland: muted earth tones, generic landscape paintings, and comfortable but unremarkable seating. The only splash of color came from the Golden Shield logo – a stylized golden shield emblazoned with a single, unwavering eye – which was plastered on the wall behind the reception desk. The overall impression was one of quiet respectability and unwavering stability, a carefully cultivated atmosphere designed to inspire trust in potential clients. However, on this particular afternoon, even the steady hum of the fluorescent lights seemed to vibrate with unspoken anxieties.
