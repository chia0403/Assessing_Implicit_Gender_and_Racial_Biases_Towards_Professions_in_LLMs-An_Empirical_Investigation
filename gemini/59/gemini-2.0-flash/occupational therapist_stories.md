The scent of disinfectant hung heavy in the air, battling a losing war against the ghosts of stale coffee and simmering anxiety. Eleanor Maeve Finnegan, Occupational Therapist, sighed and tucked a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. 7:58 AM. Two minutes before the storm.

Eleanor was stationed at the Sunshine Valley Rehabilitation Center, a sprawling, single-story complex nestled in the rolling hills just outside Asheville, North Carolina. Sunshine Valley wasn't the fanciest facility, nor the most cutting-edge, but it was *home*. It was where she'd completed her clinical rotations, where she'd learned to truly listen to the unspoken stories etched in the furrowed brows and trembling hands of her patients.

The main therapy room, affectionately known as "The Rec Room" by the staff, was a kaleidoscope of adaptive equipment. From weighted spoons and oversized building blocks to a state-of-the-art virtual reality system designed to simulate everyday tasks, everything was in place to help residents regain their independence. Sunlight streamed through the panoramic windows, glinting off the chrome of the parallel bars and illuminating dust motes dancing in the air.

Outside, the air held the crisp promise of an Appalachian autumn. But inside, Eleanor knew, the battle against injury, illness, and the creeping fear of lost abilities was about to begin. And she, Eleanor Maeve Finnegan, would be right there in the trenches, armed with her expertise, her unwavering optimism, and a well-stocked toolbox of therapeutic interventions, ready to help her patients reclaim their lives, one small, deliberate movement at a time.
