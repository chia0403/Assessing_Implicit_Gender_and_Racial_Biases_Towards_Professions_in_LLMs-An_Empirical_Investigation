The incessant dripping, a steady, rhythmic taunt, was enough to drive a sane man mad. Unfortunately for the residents of apartment 3B, sane men didn't usually answer calls at 3:00 AM, especially not on a Tuesday. Thankfully, Alistair Fitzwilliam Finch, plumber extraordinaire and connoisseur of late-night ramen, wasn't entirely sane.

Alistair, clad in faded denim overalls that had seen better decades and a t-shirt proclaiming "I Fix Things (You Break Them)," stumbled out of his ancient Ford pickup truck and into the dimly lit hallway of the Willow Creek Apartments. The air hung heavy with the aroma of stale cabbage and despair. Willow Creek was the kind of place where dreams went to die quietly in the corner, often next to a leaking pipe. Built in the 1970s, it was a brick monstrosity with peeling paint, a perpetually out-of-order elevator, and a communal laundry room that smelled vaguely of regret. The carpet, a swirling pattern of brown and orange, was stained with a history Alistair didn't want to contemplate. He heaved a sigh, grabbed his trusty toolbox (a battered metal thing held together with duct tape and wishful thinking), and started up the creaking stairs, the rhythmic drip, drip, drip echoing in his ears, growing louder with each step. He knew, with a plumber's intuition honed over years of battling clogged pipes and disgruntled tenants, that he was about to enter a watery, and potentially very bizarre, situation.
