The chipped porcelain mug warmed Esmeralda "Esme" Rodriguez's hands, offering a small comfort against the damp chill clinging to the air. Outside, the salt-laced wind howled a mournful dirge around the exposed gables of the old lighthouse, mimicking the low hum of the generator that powered the entire island.

Esme was perched on a stool in the minuscule kitchen, her elbows resting on the worn counter of "The Gull's Nest," the only diner on Puffin's Perch Island. Puffin's Perch, population sixty-three, boasted one general store, a barely-functioning post office, and the aforementioned lighthouse, which doubled as the town's only tourist attraction and Esme's place of employment.

The diner itself was a cozy, if slightly dilapidated, affair. Bright blue paint peeled from the walls, revealing glimpses of the building's original seafoam green. Fishing nets draped haphazardly from the ceiling, adorned with faded plastic buoys and the occasional, surprisingly realistic, plastic seagull. Sunlight, when it dared break through the perpetual overcast sky, streamed through the large, smudged windows, offering a breathtaking view of the turbulent Atlantic.

Esme, head cook, bottle washer, and occasional waitress (depending on Old Man Hemlock's mood), was usually bustling about, whipping up her famous clam chowder or sizzling stacks of blueberry pancakes for the early morning fishermen. But this morning, the diner was still and silent, the only sound the relentless wind and the rhythmic crashing of waves against the rocky shore. The first rays of dawn were just beginning to paint the sky a bruised purple, promising another day of relentless grey. It was going to be a long one, she suspected, and probably filled with more of Captain Hemlock's complaints about the price of cod.
