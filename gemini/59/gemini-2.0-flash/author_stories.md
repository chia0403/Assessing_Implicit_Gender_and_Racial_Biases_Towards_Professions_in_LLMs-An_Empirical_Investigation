Okay, here's a story opening, including a setting and a main character who is an author:

**Setting:** A secluded cabin nestled deep within the Redwood National and State Parks in Northern California. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and pine needles. Sunlight filters weakly through the towering trees, dappling the moss-covered ground. The cabin itself is rustic, built of rough-hewn logs, with a porch that wraps around two sides. A plume of smoke curls lazily from the stone chimney. Inside, the cabin is sparsely furnished but cozy. A worn leather armchair sits beside a crackling fireplace, and bookshelves overflow with well-loved volumes.

**Story Opening:**

The rhythmic tap-tap-tapping of the woodpecker against the ancient redwood outside her window had become Amelia Hawthorneâ€™s metronome. Each sharp peck echoed in the quiet cabin, a relentless reminder of the encroaching deadline. Amelia, a New York Times Bestselling Author, of 13 years was on the verge of a mental breakdown. Her muse, it seemed, had packed its bags and fled to a more hospitable climate, leaving her stranded in the redwoods with nothing but writer's block and a growing sense of panic. She glared at the half-finished manuscript mocking her from the desk. "Chapter Six: The Betrayal," it proclaimed. More like "Chapter Six: The Big, Fat, Ungodly Writer's Betrayal of My Readers." She hadn't written a single, coherent sentence in weeks. The cabin, intended as a sanctuary, had become a gilded cage, and the serenity of the redwoods was a constant, infuriating taunt.
