## Story Opening:

The air in the Elephant House hung thick and humid, a sensory assault of hay, earth, and the distinct, musky perfume of pachyderm. Amelia Penelope Ainsworth, known universally as Amy, sighed and scrubbed a stubborn patch of mud from the metal feeding trough with unnecessary vigour. It wasnâ€™t the mud, nor the smell, that bothered her. It was the silence.

Usually, this time of morning, the cavernous enclosure would be filled with the low rumble of Uma and Raja, the two Asian elephants under her care, as they greeted the dawn and their breakfast. Today, however, was different. Uma was restless, pacing a tight circle near the waterhole, and Raja... Raja was lying down, an unnatural stillness about his massive form that sent a shiver down Amy's spine.

She tossed the scrub brush into the bucket with a clang, the noise echoing unnervingly in the otherwise quiet space. "Right then," she murmured to herself, pushing a stray auburn curl behind her ear. "Time to find out what's got you both so bothered."

## Setting:

The story is set at the **Havenwood Wildlife Sanctuary**, a sprawling, privately-owned sanctuary nestled in the rolling hills of the Cotswolds, England. While Havenwood boasts a diverse collection of rescued and rehabilitated animals, its flagship attraction is the Elephant House, a modern, state-of-the-art facility designed to mimic the natural habitat of Asian elephants as closely as possible. The Elephant House features:

*   **A large, partially-covered enclosure:** This includes a mud wallow, a deep watering hole fed by natural springs, scratching posts made of sturdy logs, and a variety of enriching puzzle feeders.
*   **Temperature-controlled indoor stalls:** These spacious stalls provide shelter and comfort during colder months and are equipped with soft bedding and monitoring cameras.
*   **An adjacent observation platform:** This allows visitors to view the elephants from a safe distance without disturbing their routines.
*   **A small office and storage area:** Located near the back entrance, this is Amy's domain, crammed with medical supplies, enrichment materials, and an overflowing in-tray.

The sanctuary itself is situated on hundreds of acres of protected woodland and pasture, providing a natural and enriching environment for its diverse residents. However, its remote location and reliance on private funding often leave it vulnerable to external pressures and internal conflicts.
