**Opening:**

The scent of antiseptic clung to Dr. Aris Thorne like a second skin, a perfume he unknowingly trailed through the hospital corridors. For Elara Finch, Physician's Assistant extraordinaire and his perpetually exasperated colleague, it was a scent that both soothed and irritated. Today, however, the usual sterile odor was competing with something else entirely: a cloying sweetness that seemed to emanate from the ICU waiting room, thick and unsettling. Elara frowned, pushing open the door to the break room, hoping for a jolt of lukewarm coffee to cut through the sensory overload.

**Setting:**

The story takes place within the walls of **St. Jude's Hospital**, a sprawling medical complex nestled on the edge of the bustling metropolis of **New Alcott, Illinois**. The hospital itself is a labyrinth of gleaming white hallways, punctuated by the hushed murmur of medical equipment and the quiet shuffle of weary staff. It's a place of both profound sorrow and miraculous healing, a constant reminder of the fragility and resilience of human life. Elara's days are primarily spent in the **Internal Medicine wing**, specifically bouncing between the general practice clinics and the ever-stressful Emergency Room. The air is thick with a perpetual tension, a silent countdown playing in the background as doctors and nurses race against time to save lives.
