Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a lawyer named...

**Story Opening:**

The rain hammered against the panoramic window of Amelia Stone's office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her. Downtown Seattle shimmered, a blurred, iridescent landscape of refracted light and blurred car headlights. It was late – past ten, easily – and the only sound besides the storm was the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of her manicured fingernail against the mahogany desk. Amelia took another swig of lukewarm coffee, its bitterness a familiar companion in these late-night vigils. On the desk before her lay a thick file, its manila cover emblazoned with a single word: "Sullivan." A shiver ran down her spine, despite the central heating. This wasn't just another case. This was *the* case. The one that could make her career, or utterly destroy it. And she had a gut feeling, a lawyer's sixth sense honed by years of navigating the murky waters of the legal system, that Sullivan was going to be a deep, dark swim.

**Setting:**

Amelia Stone's office is located on the 37th floor of the "Cascade Tower" in downtown Seattle, Washington. It is a modern, high-end law office, reflecting her success as a rising star at the prestigious firm, Harding & Bellweather. The space is deliberately designed for both comfort and gravitas.

*   **The View:** The most striking feature is the floor-to-ceiling window offering a sweeping view of the Seattle skyline, Puget Sound, and the Olympic Mountains on a clear day (which, admittedly, are rare).

*   **The Furniture:** Rich mahogany desk dominates the space, meticulously organized (usually). A comfortable leather armchair and a sleek, minimalist sofa provide seating for clients and meetings.

*   **The Details:** Artwork is carefully chosen – abstract pieces in muted tones that suggest sophistication without being overly distracting. A small, antique scale of justice sits on a shelf, a symbolic reminder of Amelia's profession. Awards and certificates, subtly illuminated, subtly hint at her accomplishments. A small, framed photograph of Amelia with her late grandmother sits on the corner of the desk - a reminder of who she does this work for.

The overall impression is one of power, success, and meticulous attention to detail. It's a space designed to impress clients and intimidate adversaries, but also a place where Amelia can retreat to strategize and confront the moral complexities of her work.
