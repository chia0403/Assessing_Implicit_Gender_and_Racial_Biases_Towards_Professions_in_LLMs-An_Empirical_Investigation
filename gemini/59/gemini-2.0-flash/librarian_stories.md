The scent of old paper and beeswax polish hung heavy in the air, a comforting balm to Elara Willowbrookâ€™s soul. Outside, the rain lashed against the stained-glass windows of the Grandhaven Library, a symphony of dreary percussion. Inside, Elara, officially the Head Librarian, but unofficially the Keeper of Grandhaven's Stories, carefully adjusted a first edition of "Wuthering Heights" in its protective glass case. The library itself was a relic, built in 1888, a towering Gothic structure that seemed to both guard and whisper secrets. High, vaulted ceilings were painted with swirling constellations, and the air hummed with the ghosts of countless whispered words and turned pages. Tonight, Elara was alone, a solitary figure in a kingdom of silence, the only sound the rhythmic tick of the grandfather clock in the main hall, marking the passage of time like a slow, deliberate heartbeat. The old building creaked and groaned around her, settling into the storm-tossed night, and Elara couldn't help but feel a familiar sense of unease. Grandhaven held its stories close, and sometimes, she suspected, those stories wanted to be heard.
