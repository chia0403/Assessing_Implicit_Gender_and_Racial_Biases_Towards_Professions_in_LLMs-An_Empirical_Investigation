The aroma of stale coffee and disinfectant hung heavy in the air of Cedar Creek Elementary, clinging to the linoleum floors and the brightly colored, but slightly faded, motivational posters. Rain lashed against the windows, mirroring the gnawing unease in Dr. Eleanor Rose Fairchild’s stomach. It was a Tuesday in mid-October, prime anxiety season, or so she jokingly called it to the other faculty. Truthfully, there was nothing amusing about the uptick in disruptive behaviors, tearful meltdowns, and hushed whispers of “I don’t want to go to school,” echoing from the hallways.

Eleanor sat at her desk, a haven of organized chaos in the otherwise sterile room, pushing a stack of referral forms around like reluctant chess pieces. Each form represented a child struggling, and with each child, a piece of Eleanor’s own heart ached. She glanced at the overflowing inbox on her computer, dread settling in her bones. Another day battling the bureaucratic monster, navigating IEPs, parent conferences, and the endless parade of childhood anxieties. And outside, the storm continued to rage, as if nature itself were empathizing with the emotional tempest brewing within the walls of Cedar Creek Elementary.
