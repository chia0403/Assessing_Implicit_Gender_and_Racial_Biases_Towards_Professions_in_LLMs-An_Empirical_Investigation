The sterile scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, a stark counterpoint to the earthy, damp smell of the bayou seeping in through the ill-fitting window frames. Dr. Eleanor Grace Dubois, her brow furrowed in concentration, carefully stitched the ragged gash on Mr. Thibodeaux's arm. Heâ€™d caught it on a rogue piece of rusty metal out by the crawfish traps again. This was life in Pointe-aux-Chenes, Louisiana, a life Eleanor had both fled and been inexplicably drawn back to.

The clinic itself was a cramped, single-story building, affectionately (and ironically) dubbed "Our Lady of Lourdes" by the locals. Its peeling paint, once a vibrant blue, now faded to a sickly turquoise, hinted at a bygone era of prosperity that the town hadn't seen in decades. The examination room was cramped, cluttered with outdated medical equipment, stacks of patient files threatening to topple, and a half-finished crochet project Eleanor had been attempting for weeks. Beyond the exam room, a tiny waiting area housed three mismatched chairs, perpetually occupied by patients ranging from elderly women with ailments as old as the cypress trees to restless children recovering from alligator bites.

Outside, the bayou stretched out like a shimmering, emerald tapestry, punctuated by the gnarled knees of ancient cypress trees draped in Spanish moss. The air hummed with the incessant drone of cicadas and the occasional mournful cry of a heron. The sun beat down relentlessly, baking the corrugated iron roofs of the scattered houses and reflecting fiercely off the water, creating a shimmering haze that blurred the lines between reality and swampy dream. Pointe-aux-Chenes was a place clinging to tradition, a place where the old ways died hard, and a place that stubbornly held onto secrets just as tightly. And Eleanor Dubois, after years of escaping its grasp, found herself inextricably tangled in its thorny embrace once more.
