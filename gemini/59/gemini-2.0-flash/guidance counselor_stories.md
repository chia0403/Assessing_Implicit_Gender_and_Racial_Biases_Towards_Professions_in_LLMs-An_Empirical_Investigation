## Story Opening & Setting

**Setting:** The fluorescent lights of Northwood High School buzzed a monotonous counterpoint to the frantic energy thrumming through the hallways on the first day back after Thanksgiving break. Lockers slammed, conversations overlapped into an indecipherable roar, and the air was thick with the scent of microwaved popcorn and Axe body spray. Inside the guidance counselor's office, however, a semblance of order reigned.

**Opening:** The rhythmic click-clack of fingernails against a ceramic mug punctuated the silence in the small, cluttered office. Elara Vivian Bloom, Northwood High's resident guru of college applications and existential teenage angst, squinted at the complex spreadsheet on her computer screen. "Early Action deadlines, thou art a cruel mistress," she muttered, taking a long sip of lukewarm Earl Grey tea. The mug, emblazoned with the aggressively cheerful slogan "Keep Calm and Apply," felt ironic in her hand. A stack of recommendation requests threatened to topple over on her desk, forming a paper avalanche of ambition and desperation. Just another Monday, Elara thought with a sigh, except this Monday carried the added weight of knowing she was about to face a wave of students fueled by turkey, regret, and the looming specter of second semester. The first knock, tentative but insistent, came just as she finished the thought. "Come in," she called, bracing herself for whatever storm was about to break.
