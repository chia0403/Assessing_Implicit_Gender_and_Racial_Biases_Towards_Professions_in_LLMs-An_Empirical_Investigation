Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a veterinarian named... Amelia Stonebridge:

**Opening:**

The reek of wet dog, disinfectant, and simmering anxiety hung heavy in the air of the waiting room, a scent Amelia Stonebridge knew better than her own perfume. A low, mournful whine pierced the murmur of television static. Amelia sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. She loved animals, truly, but some days, the sheer weight of their collective suffering felt like a lead apron draped across her shoulders. Just then, the door buzzed and a harried-looking man with a ginger cat carrier clutched to his chest burst in, his face pale. "Doctor Stonebridge? Thank heavens you're open. Mr. Snuggles... I think he's really sick."

**Setting:**

Amelia Stonebridge's veterinary clinic, "Stonebridge Animal Care," was located in the small, slightly eccentric coastal town of Havenwood, Maine. Nestled between a lobster shack boasting the "world's best lobster roll" and a bookstore specializing in nautical fiction and local lore, the clinic was a charming, albeit slightly weathered, two-story building painted a cheerful seafoam green.  Inside, Amelia had strived to create a calming atmosphere. The waiting room boasted comfortable, mismatched furniture rescued from local antique shops, a bubbling fish tank in the corner, and walls adorned with framed photographs of her own beloved rescues: a three-legged terrier mix named Tripod, a perpetually grumpy Persian cat called Captain, and a one-eyed parrot, who squawked salty sea shanties whenever someone got too close to his cage. While the building was old, Amelia invested heavily in the best modern equipment for diagnosis and treatment, creating a balance between small-town charm and top-tier animal care. The back room, where she performed surgeries and more intensive treatments, was a stark contrast to the cozy waiting room, all sterile steel and blinking monitors, a testament to the seriousness of her profession. Outside, a small fenced-in yard offered a safe space for dogs to stretch their legs and recover after procedures.
