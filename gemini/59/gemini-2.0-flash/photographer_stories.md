The dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the grimy window of the abandoned bakery, illuminating the crumbling remains of what had once been a haven for sugar and warmth. Now, the air tasted only of stale flour and forgotten dreams. Eleanor Finch, her fingers numb despite the fingerless gloves she wore, adjusted the focus on her vintage Hasselblad. The camera, a hulking piece of metal and glass, was the only thing in her life that still felt truly solid.

Eleanor Finch, professional photographer and purveyor of poignant, almost painfully honest images, had found herself in the heart of Oblivion, Ohio. It wasn't officially called that, of course. The sign on the outskirts stubbornly proclaimed "Welcome to Harmony Glen!" in faded, cheerful lettering. But Harmony Glen had withered, leaving behind only skeletal buildings and the ghosts of industry. The steel mill, the town's lifeblood for generations, had closed a decade ago, leaving the people to bleed out slowly.

Eleanor had come here chasing whispers. Whispers of decay, whispers of despair, whispers of a beauty only found in the ruins. She sought the stories etched into peeling paint, the poetry in broken windows, the humanity clinging stubbornly to the edges of oblivion. The abandoned bakery, with its ghostly outlines of sugar-dusted pastries and its silent, expectant oven, was her first stop. She knew, with a certainty that settled deep in her bones, that the heart of Harmony Glen, and perhaps a piece of her own lost soul, lay buried somewhere within its dusty walls.
