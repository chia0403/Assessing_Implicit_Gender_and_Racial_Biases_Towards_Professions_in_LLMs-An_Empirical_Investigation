## Story Opening:

The stale scent of lavender and wintergreen did little to mask the underlying anxiety that clung to Beatrice Eleanor Thorne like the oil residue on her hands. Outside, the February wind howled a mournful tune against the frosted windows of "Kneadful Things," her massage therapy studio. Inside, the air was thick with the pre-session jitters Beatrice felt every time she welcomed a new client. Not the nervous energy that propelled her through the technicalities of Swedish massage or deep tissue work; this was a deeper, more primal worry. It was the fear that, despite her best efforts, she wouldn't be able to reach them. To truly *knead* their knotted muscles, and, in doing so, somehow ease the heavier burden they carried within. Today, that burden seemed amplified. Mr. Silas Blackwood was due any minute. The name alone sounded like a gothic novel, and his intake form hinted at a life lived under a persistent cloud.

**Setting:**

"Kneadful Things" was Beatrice's attempt at creating a haven amidst the bustling, often abrasive, energy of Port Blossom, Maine. The studio occupied a modest storefront on Main Street, sandwiched between a quirky antique shop and a clam shack that perpetually reeked of fried seafood. Inside, Beatrice had cultivated a sense of understated calm. Soft, muted greens and blues adorned the walls, complemented by natural wood accents. A trickling water fountain offered a subtle soundtrack, while strategically placed Himalayan salt lamps cast a warm, inviting glow. The massage table, draped in plush, ivory-colored linens, occupied the center of the main room, promising respite and relaxation. Books on aromatherapy, anatomy, and mindfulness lined a small bookshelf in the corner. It was a space Beatrice poured her heart into, hoping to offer her clients more than just a physical treatment; she aspired to provide a sanctuary, a place where they could finally unclench.
