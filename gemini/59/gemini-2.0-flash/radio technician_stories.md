## Story Opening & Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The hum was the first thing Elara noticed, a low, persistent thrum that vibrated through the soles of her worn leather boots. It wasn't the usual static buzz that permeated the airwaves of KSPX, the local public radio station; this was different, deeper, almostâ€¦organic. Elara switched off the soldering iron, the tiny spark momentarily eclipsing the dust motes dancing in the beam of her desk lamp. "Okay," she muttered to herself, pushing stray strands of auburn hair behind her ear, "time to find out what's messing with my signal."

**Setting:**

The year is 1957. Elara Maeve Davies works as the sole radio technician and part-time announcer for KSPX, a small, struggling public radio station nestled in the sleepy coastal town of Port Blossom, Oregon. The station is housed in a weathered, two-story building overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Salt spray regularly coats the windows, and the seagulls are notorious for perching on the antenna array, occasionally knocking out the signal entirely.

Inside, the station is a testament to mid-century electronics and well-worn practicality. Elara's cramped workshop on the second floor is a chaotic yet organized mess of vacuum tubes, resistors, wires, and vintage test equipment. Old schematics are tacked to the corkboard, and the air is thick with the scent of solder and ozone. Outside her workshop, the main studio boasts a cozy, if somewhat outdated, aesthetic with wood-paneled walls, a vintage microphone, and a collection of vinyl records stacked haphazardly on a shelf. The entire station feels like a relic of a bygone era, a comforting anachronism in a world rapidly embracing the future.
