**Setting:**

The biting February wind howled a mournful tune around the granite gargoyles that adorned the ancient walls of St. Michael’s College, Oxford. A thin layer of ice clung to the cobblestones of Radcliffe Square, mirroring the steely grey sky above. Inside the Bodleian Library, the air was thick with the scent of aged paper, leather, and the faint, pervasive aroma of beeswax polish. It was late afternoon, and the hushed reading room, usually bustling with students and scholars, was starting to empty as the daylight faded and the promise of evening loomed.

**Opening:**

Professor Alistair Finch, PhD, FRHistS, paused, his breath misting in the cold air as he navigated the labyrinthine stacks of the Lower Reading Room. The weight of the ancient tome he cradled against his chest, a first edition copy of “De Historia Plantarum” by Theophrastus, felt strangely comforting amidst the labyrinthine corridors. He had been poring over its faded Greek script for hours, chasing a particularly elusive reference to a mythical herb said to possess the power to heal any wound. For Professor Finch, the world of botany was far more than a field of academic study; it was a solace, a refuge from a world that often felt too harsh and unforgiving.
