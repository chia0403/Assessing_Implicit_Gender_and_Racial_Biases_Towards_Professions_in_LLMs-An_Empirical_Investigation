The hammering was a dull, insistent throb in August's oppressive heat, a metronome counting down the minutes until **Beatrice "Bea" Anastasia Kowalski** could legitimately call it quits for the day. Sweat slicked her brow, stinging her eyes as she hammered another asphalt shingle into place. Beneath her, the roof of the two-story Victorian sagged slightly, a testament to years of neglect and termites with expensive tastes.

Bea was perched precariously atop number 23 Sparrow Lane, a house so charmingly dilapidated it looked like it belonged on a postcardâ€¦ a postcard titled "Danger: Enter at Your Own Risk." The entire street, nestled in the historic district of the sleepy town of Havenwood, Pennsylvania, was a kaleidoscope of gingerbread trim, peeling paint, and overgrown gardens. Century-old trees, heavy with leaves, cast dappled shadows on the houses, lending an air of gothic romance to the stifling afternoon. Havenwood was known for its tranquility, its antique shops, and its stubborn residents who clung fiercely to the past, even if it meant living in homes slowly succumbing to the relentless march of time.

And that was where Bea came in. She was the only roofer in Havenwood willing to tackle these architectural relics, not because she had a particular fondness for creaky floorboards and lead paint, but because, frankly, the competition had all retired to Florida and left a gaping hole in the market. Plus, Bea had a soft spot for the old places. She saw the stories they held in their weathered clapboard and their stubbornly charming imperfections. As she hammered, she imagined the lives lived within these walls, the laughter and tears, the secrets whispered in the hushed darkness of night. Sometimes, she even thought she could hear the faint echoes of those forgotten voices, whispering along with the wind through the eaves.
