## The Opium Room

The humid Bangkok air hung heavy, a fragrant blanket of jasmine and exhaust fumes, as Eleanor Maeve Ashton unlocked the heavy teak doors of the House of Silk. Eleanor, or Ellie to anyone who didn't appreciate a good alliteration, adjusted the microphone clipped to her crisp linen shirt. The House, once a private residence belonging to a wealthy Sino-Thai merchant, was now her domain, the jewel in the crown of her "Bangkok Beyond the Brochures" tour company.

Inside, the clatter of Sukhumvit Road faded, replaced by a hushed reverence. Sunlight streamed through intricately carved screens, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the air. The building was a labyrinth of ornate rooms, each a miniature history lesson, each whispering tales of fortunes made and lost. But Ellieâ€™s favourite, the one she saved for last and the one that always captivated her audience, was the Opium Room.

This room, tucked away at the end of a narrow corridor, was smaller and less opulent than the others. The walls were painted a muted, almost sickly, shade of green. No silk adorned the surfaces; instead, simple, low cushions were scattered across the floor. A single, ornate opium pipe, crafted from jade and ivory, sat displayed behind thick glass, a silent testament to a darker era.

Ellie took a deep breath, the air in the room somehow thicker, more weighted with the past. She knew this room held secrets, stories that weren't written in the history books. She could feel them clinging to the jade, swirling in the dusty sunbeams. And today, more than ever, she felt an urge to unravel them.
