## Story Opening & Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The chipped porcelain of Mrs. Van Derlyn's heirloom teapot warmed Amelia Rose Cartwright's hands as she traced the floral pattern with a weary finger. The silence of the sprawling manor house pressed in on her, thick and heavy like the velvet drapes she'd just wrestled into submission. Another day, another mountain of dust bunnies banished, another tapestry straightened with the precision of a brain surgeon. It was a life, Amelia supposed, even if it felt more like a penance. This morning, however, the penance felt particularly grueling. Something wasâ€¦off.

**Setting:**

The story unfolds in the grand, albeit slightly decaying, Van Derlyn Manor, located in the fictional coastal town of Seabrook, Massachusetts. The manor itself is a three-story Victorian behemoth, perched precariously on a craggy cliff overlooking the churning Atlantic. Built in the late 1800s, it boasts ornate detailing, including gargoyles, stained-glass windows, and a labyrinthine layout of rooms filled with antique furniture, dusty portraits, and the lingering scent of sea salt and old money. Seabrook, meanwhile, is a sleepy, windswept town, clinging to the traditions of its maritime past. Whispers of old sea captains, hidden treasures, and restless spirits are as much a part of the local fabric as the call of the gulls and the salty tang in the air. While tourist season brings a temporary influx of visitors, Seabrook retains a quiet, almost melancholic atmosphere, steeped in history and secrets. Van Derlyn Manor stands as a silent guardian of those secrets, a testament to a bygone era and a breeding ground for the unsettling feeling that Amelia couldn't quite shake.
