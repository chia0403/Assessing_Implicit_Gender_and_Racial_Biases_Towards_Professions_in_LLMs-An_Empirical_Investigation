The stale aroma of cheap coffee mingled with the lingering scent of stale desperation, a familiar cocktail that clung to the furniture in the dimly lit office of Reginald "Reg" Bartholomew the Third. Rain hammered against the grimy window of his third-floor walk-up, mimicking the relentless pounding in his head. Reg, nursing a lukewarm cup of the aforementioned brew, stared at the flickering neon sign across the street – "Rosie's Diner – Always Open" – a beacon of questionable culinary choices in the heart of Old Town Galveston, Texas. The sign hummed, a discordant melody to the rhythmic thump of his pulse. He rubbed a hand across his perpetually unshaven jaw, the rasp of stubble a small comfort in the early morning gloom. The walls of his office, adorned with faded posters of old noir films and a meticulously organized collection of case files overflowing from battered filing cabinets, seemed to close in on him, a testament to the unsolved mysteries that haunted both the city and his own life. This was his domain: a sanctuary of cigarette smoke, broken dreams, and the faint hope that one day, someone would walk through that door with a case that could finally break the Galveston curse.
