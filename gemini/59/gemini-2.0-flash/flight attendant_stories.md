Okay, here's a story opening and setting, including the main character's full name:

**Opening:**

The overhead lights of the 777 flickered, a pre-dawn disco that did little to soothe Amelia Rosaline Davies's frayed nerves. She plastered a practiced smile on her face, the kind she reserved for toddlers threatening tantrums and businessmen demanding extra peanuts. "Coffee, sir? Tea? Or perhaps something stronger to prepare you for the delights of Orlando?" she asked the gentleman in 42B, her voice a carefully modulated lilt that masked the silent scream building inside.

He mumbled something about wanting a Bloody Mary, and Amelia moved on, her smile faltering as she passed the empty seat in 43A. It was always the empty seats that got to her. They whispered stories of missed connections, changed plans, and sometimes, far more tragic absences. This one, bathed in the ghostly blue of the cabinâ€™s emergency lighting, felt particularly heavy.

**Setting:**

The story opens on board a British Airways Boeing 777, registration G-ZZZB, mid-flight from London Heathrow to Orlando International Airport. It's approximately 5:00 AM, London time, which puts the plane roughly halfway across the Atlantic Ocean. The cabin is mostly dark, with only the aforementioned emergency lights and individual reading lights illuminating the faces of sleeping or restless passengers. The air is thick with the dry, recycled air of long-haul travel, a faint scent of stale coffee, and a lingering hint of the duty-free perfumes Amelia had sprayed earlier in the flight. Outside, the vast, inky blackness of the Atlantic stretches to the horizon, broken only by the occasional twinkling star. The gentle hum of the engines vibrates through the floor, a constant, hypnotic drone that usually lulls passengers to sleep, but tonight, it only amplifies Amelia's unease. The galley is a cramped, stainless-steel haven, cluttered with beverage carts, half-empty snack boxes, and the detritus of a long night. It is a small, contained world suspended thousands of feet above the earth, where Amelia Rosaline Davies is about to face more than just turbulence.
