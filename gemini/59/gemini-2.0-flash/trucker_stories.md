## Story Opening:

The squeal of air brakes tore through the pre-dawn silence, a metallic shriek that echoed off the corrugated iron walls of the truck stop. Dust devils, disturbed by the sudden halt, danced across the cracked asphalt, catching the faint glow of the sodium lamps above.  Dust motes swirled in the cab of the '89 Kenworth W900, momentarily obscuring the face of  **Evelyn Mae "Evie"  Callahan**, as she wrestled the gear shift into park.  A sigh escaped her lips, fogging the already greasy window.  Another all-nighter, another hundred miles chipped away at the vast, unforgiving tapestry of the American Southwest.

**Setting:**

Evie was parked at "Rusty's Last Stop," a truck stop perched precariously on the edge of the Mojave Desert, just off I-40, somewhere between Needles and Barstow, California. Rusty's wasn't exactly known for its gourmet cuisine or sparkling cleanliness.  It was a place of cracked vinyl booths, perpetually lukewarm coffee, and a lingering smell of diesel and desperation.  The paint on the building was peeling, revealing patches of sun-baked wood underneath. A faded sign reading "EAT" leaned drunkenly over the entrance, threatening to topple at the next gust of desert wind.  Outside, a graveyard of chrome and rubber lay scattered amongst the scrub brush â€“ the skeletal remains of trucks long past their prime, picked clean by the unforgiving desert.  Beyond the truck stop, the landscape stretched out in a monotonous expanse of scrub and sand, punctuated by the occasional Joshua tree, their twisted limbs reaching towards the pale, pre-dawn sky like gnarled supplicants.  The air, even at this hour, held a dry, prickly heat that promised a scorching day ahead.  This was the kind of place you stopped to refill, refuel, and maybe grab a greasy burger before hitting the road again, never lingering longer than necessary. It was the kind of place where stories were etched into the cracked faces of the regulars and whispered on the wind. And Evie Callahan, as she rubbed the grit from her eyes, had a feeling this was going to be one of those stories.
