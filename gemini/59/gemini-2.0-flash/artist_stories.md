## Story Opening:

The salt spray stung Clara Beatrice Abernathy's face, but she barely noticed. Her gaze, usually softened with a gentle humor, was laser-focused on the churning canvas of the Atlantic. She hunched further into her worn, paint-splattered fisherman's sweater, the wind whipping at her tangled, auburn hair. The charcoal in her hand moved with a practiced urgency, capturing the ephemeral dance of light and shadow on the waves. A squawk erupted from above, and she glanced up to see a seagull, its white wings flashing against the stormy sky. It was a fleeting moment of pristine beauty, quickly swallowed by the grey. She drew a quick, bold stroke, mirroring the bird's flight in her sketchbook.

“Damn you, weather,” she muttered under her breath, but a small smile played on her lips. The tempestuous energy fueled her creativity. Today, the sea was a furious beast, and Clara, the tamer.

## Setting:

The scene unfolds on the rugged, windswept cliffs of Cape Disappointment, Washington. The year is 1934. Clara, a struggling artist seeking solace and inspiration in the raw beauty of the Pacific Northwest, has rented a small, dilapidated cottage perched precariously on the edge of the precipice. The cottage, aptly named "The Wanderer's Rest," is a single-room affair, crammed with canvases, brushes, and overflowing sketchbooks. A wood-burning stove struggles to keep the damp chill at bay. The constant roar of the ocean is both a comforting lullaby and a constant reminder of the untamed power of nature. The surrounding landscape is a tapestry of jagged rocks, gnarled trees, and the ever-present, unforgiving sea, a perfect haven for an artist wrestling with her own inner storms.
