The scent of stale crayons and Elmer’s glue hung heavy in the air, a familiar aroma that usually comforted Miss Eleanor Pearl Worthington. Today, however, it felt like a suffocating blanket. It was the last Friday before summer vacation at Maplewood Elementary, and the classroom was a disaster zone – a chaotic testament to the pent-up energy of twenty-three seven-year-olds aching for freedom. Tables were smeared with glitter glue remnants, paper scraps littered the floor like confetti at a forgotten parade, and a half-finished construction paper volcano sat precariously balanced on Eleanor’s desk, threatening a molten (read: crumpled red tissue paper) eruption.

Maplewood Elementary, a squat, red brick building nestled in the heart of the sleepy town of Oakhaven, Ohio, was a place of simple routines and predictable joys. Sunlight streamed through the large, paned windows of Eleanor’s second-grade classroom, illuminating posters depicting the alphabet adorned with cartoon animals and a world map dotted with push pins from past geography lessons. Outside, the manicured lawn buzzed with the promise of summer, the air thick with the smell of freshly cut grass and the distant laughter of older students already released into the wild. Normally, Eleanor found solace in the predictable rhythm of Maplewood, in the gentle cadence of her students’ voices as they stumbled over sight words, in the quiet satisfaction of watching a seed of understanding blossom in their young minds. But today, the chaos felt amplified, the energy almost unbearable. Today, Eleanor just wanted the bell to ring.
