The fluorescent lights of the "Get Your Grind On" gym hummed, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the sweaty, grunting bodies. Dr. Amelia Jane Finch, Registered Dietitian and Nutritionist, pinched the bridge of her nose, trying to block out the cacophony of clanging weights and breathless motivational speeches blaring from the overhead speakers. This was not her preferred environment. Amelia preferred the gentle clinking of cutlery on ceramic plates, the fragrant steam rising from a meticulously crafted lentil soup, the hushed consultation room where she could truly help people understand the connection between food and feeling.

Here, surrounded by protein shake-fueled ambition and the constant, underlying pressure to conform to an impossible ideal, Amelia felt like a misplaced radish in a field of rapidly growing, genetically modified tomatoes. She was here, however, under direct orders from her boss, Dr. Thompson, who believed in "boots on the ground" outreach. Amelia, who preferred the measured pace of her clinical practice, considered this "boots in the swamp" outreach. She took another deep breath, smoothed the wrinkles from her sensible linen pantsuit (entirely unsuitable for the atmosphere), and plastered on her most approachable smile. Today, she was offering free nutritional consultations. May the protein powders and pre-workout supplements have mercy on her soul.
