The crimson sun bled across the sky, painting the bay in shades of fiery orange and bruised purple. It was the kind of sunset that usually inspired poetry and romantic declarations, but for Abigail Eleanor Thorne, it only amplified the gnawing anxiety in her stomach.

**Setting:**

Havenwood, Maine, population dwindling but spirit (of all kinds) thriving. The town was nestled on a jagged peninsula jutting out into the Atlantic, a collection of salt-streaked clapboard houses clinging to the rocky coastline.

Havenwood was known for two things: its exceptionally potent lobster bisque and its exceptionally active paranormal population. The town's history was steeped in maritime tragedy, whispered tales of smugglers and lost fishermen, all of whom seemed to have taken up permanent residence within the walls of its grand, albeit decaying, homes.
