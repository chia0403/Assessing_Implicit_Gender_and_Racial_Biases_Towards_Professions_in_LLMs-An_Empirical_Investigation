Okay, here's a story opening and setting, featuring a stone cutter named Silas Blackwood:

**Setting:**

The biting wind whipped off the Grey Peak Mountains, stinging the cheeks of anyone foolish enough to be outside before the sun fully crested their jagged, snow-dusted peaks. The air hung thick and heavy with the smell of damp stone and wood smoke, a perennial scent in the village of Stonehaven. Nestled at the foot of the mountains, Stonehaven existed for one purpose: to quarry the world's finest grey granite. Houses were built of the same sturdy stone, their roofs weighed down with slate, giving the village a feeling of immutability, a permanence that belied the precarious existence of its inhabitants. Quarry workers risked life and limb daily, while stone cutters like Silas painstakingly shaped the raw material into works of art, or, more often, mundane building blocks for larger cities further inland. Life was hard, unforgiving, and steeped in tradition.

**Story Opening:**

Silas Blackwood spat on his calloused hands and rubbed them together, the rough skin catching on itself with a rasp. The sky was a bruised purple, just beginning to lighten at the eastern edge. Another day, another mountain of granite waiting to be tamed. He glanced at the rough-hewn block before him, already etched with the beginnings of a gargoyle. He had been commissioned by Master Eldrin, the village's only scribe, to create the grotesque creature to adorn the eaves of his new house, a symbol, Eldrin had declared pompously, of "protection and literacy." Silas thought it was mostly a way for the self-important scribe to flaunt his meager wealth. Still, it was a commission, and commissions had been scarce since the new quarry master, a cruel man named Vorlag, had tightened his grip on Stonehavenâ€™s resources. He hefted his hammer, the familiar weight comforting in its reliability, and brought it down on his chisel. The cold ring of steel on stone echoed through the pre-dawn stillness, a lonely counterpoint to the mournful cry of a mountain hawk circling overhead.
