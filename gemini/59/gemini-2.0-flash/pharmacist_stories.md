Okay, here's a story opening and setting focusing on a pharmacist named...

**Setting:**

The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune above the rows of neatly organized pharmaceuticals in "Goodman's Pharmacy," located in the small, somewhat forgotten town of Havenwood, West Virginia. Outside, the wind howled a mournful ballad, rattling the aging windows and shaking the faded red brick building. It was the tail end of a brutal November, and the first flurries of snow were already clinging to the bare branches of the oaks that lined Main Street. The pharmacy itself smelled of a comforting, albeit slightly antiseptic, blend of rubbing alcohol, cherry cough syrup, and the faint, lingering scent of Mrs. Gable's peculiar lavender hand lotion.

**Opening:**

Elias Bartholomew Finch, his brow furrowed in concentration, carefully counted out a prescription of omeprazole into a small amber vial. His fingers, long and slightly calloused from years of handling pills and typing labels, moved with practiced efficiency. The rhythmic clinking of the pills against the glass was almost meditative. He glanced up at the clock on the wall â€“ 7:58 PM. Two minutes until closing. He was hoping for a quiet end to a particularly draining day.

He'd already dealt with Mrs. Henderson's endless complaints about the rising cost of her blood pressure medication, young Timmy Carter's stomach flu (and Timmy's mother's frantic, misguided attempts to self-diagnose via WebMD), and old Mr. Abernathy's usual rambling stories about his prize-winning pumpkins, each tale delivered with the same, slightly off-kilter enthusiasm. Elias loved Havenwood, in a way, but some days, the constant stream of ailments and anxieties wore him down.

He capped the vial, placed it in a small paper bag, and straightened the labels on the adjacent shelves, a habit he'd developed to combat the creeping sense of chaos that seemed to always lurk just beneath the surface of his carefully ordered life. He was just about to flip the "Closed" sign on the front door when the bell above it jingled, announcing a late arrival.

He sighed inwardly. Two minutes to closing had turned into however long this new customer needed. And tonight, of all nights, he just wanted to go home, brew a pot of Earl Grey tea, and lose himself in the pages of a good book.
