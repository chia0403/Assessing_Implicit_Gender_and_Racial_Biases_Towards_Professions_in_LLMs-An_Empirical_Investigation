The flickering neon sign of the "Golden Crumb Bakery" cast an oily, orange glow onto the rain-slicked streets of Oakhaven. Inside, the aroma of yeasty bread and sugared cinnamon, usually so comforting, did little to soothe Beatrice Penelope Plumtree’s frayed nerves. Beatrice, Head Bookkeeper of the Golden Crumb for the last fifteen years, sat hunched over a mountain of invoices, her brow furrowed like a carelessly folded napkin. The bakery, a beloved local institution, was usually a haven of bustling activity, filled with chattering customers and the rhythmic clatter of baking trays. Tonight, however, it was eerily quiet, save for the persistent dripping of a leaky faucet in the back and the frantic tapping of Beatrice’s calculator.

Oakhaven, nestled in a valley between the more glamorous seaside towns, was a place where time seemed to move at a gentler pace. It was a town where the local news consisted of Mrs. Higgins' prize-winning petunias and the annual bake-off at the town hall. A place where everyone knew everyone else’s business, and secrets were as rare as perfectly formed croissants on a Monday morning. And tonight, in this quiet haven, Beatrice Penelope Plumtree, a woman who found solace in the precise columns of numbers, suspected a dark secret was about to unravel, right here amongst the flour dust and forgotten sugar plums.
