## Story Opening:

The fluorescent hum of the office lights was a constant, irritating drone, a low-level tinnitus echoing the anxieties swirling in Patricia Louise Abernathy's stomach. It was late March, and the tax season beast was at its hungriest. Patricia, elbows propped on her cluttered desk, stared bleary-eyed at the spreadsheet glowing on her monitor. Numbers swam before her, blurring into a meaningless sea of deductions, credits, and exemptions.

She was drowning.

Just then, the phone rang, its shrill peal slicing through the hum like a rusty saw. Patricia winced, reaching for the receiver with a sigh that rustled the stack of W-2s piled precariously beside it. "Abernathy Accounting, Patricia speaking," she said, forcing a cheerful tone.

The voice on the other end was hushed, bordering on frantic. "Mrs. Abernathy? It's… it's Mr. Henderson. From the antique shop? I need to talk to you. It's… urgent."

Patricia felt a prickle of unease. Mr. Henderson was a regular client, a kind, if somewhat eccentric, old man who always brought her a small, carefully wrapped gift from his shop – usually a slightly chipped teacup or a tarnished silver spoon. He was never frantic. Urgent usually translated to trouble.

"Alright, Mr. Henderson. What's going on?"

## Setting:

Patricia Louise Abernathy's office, "Abernathy Accounting, Your Tax-Time Allies," occupied a small, somewhat dusty space on the second floor of a brick building overlooking Main Street in the small, sleepy town of Havenwood, Pennsylvania. The building, built in the early 1900s, had seen better days, its once-grand façade now marred by peeling paint and a slightly crooked awning.

The interior of Patricia's office was a reflection of its owner – organized chaos. Stacks of tax forms, receipts, and client files formed precarious towers on every surface. Framed pictures of her beloved golden retriever, Gus, interspersed with faded diplomas and certificates, adorned the walls. A half-eaten sandwich sat forlornly on a corner of her desk, next to a lukewarm mug of coffee. The air, thick with the scent of stale paper and lemon-scented disinfectant, held the distinct aroma of desperation – a hallmark of tax season in Havenwood. The single window overlooked the bustling (by Havenwood standards) Main Street, a kaleidoscope of local businesses and the occasional meandering tourist. But on this particular late afternoon, the world outside seemed muted, distant, almost irrelevant compared to the looming deadlines and the increasingly agitated voice crackling through the phone.
