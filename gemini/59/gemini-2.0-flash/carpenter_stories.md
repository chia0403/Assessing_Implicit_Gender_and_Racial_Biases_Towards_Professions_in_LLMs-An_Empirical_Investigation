## Story Opening:

The rasp of the hand plane echoed in the cavernous workshop, a rhythmic whisper against the rising storm outside. Elias Thorne, his brow furrowed in concentration, ran the blade along the length of a cherrywood plank, shavings curling away like cinnamon ribbons. The scent of cedar and sawdust hung heavy in the air, a comforting balm against the anxiety tightening its grip on his chest. He hadn't been able to shake the feeling of unease since the raven had landed on the weather vane, its obsidian eyes staring directly at his window. Ravens were just birds, he knew, but in this isolated corner of the world, steeped in folklore and whispered fears, they carried a weight they shouldn’t. Elias took a deep breath, trying to focus on the task at hand – the intricate details of the coffin lid he was crafting for old Mrs. Abernathy, a woman he'd known since he was knee-high. But even the familiar wood, the satisfying scrape of the plane, couldn’t quite banish the unsettling premonition that clung to him like the damp autumn air.
## Setting:

The village of Hollow Creek clung to the edge of the Blackwood Forest like a lost button on a threadbare coat. Nestled in a valley perpetually shrouded in mist, it was a place where time seemed to slow to a crawl, and the ancient trees whispered secrets in the wind. Houses were built close together, huddled for warmth and comfort, their thatched roofs sloping low under the weight of moss and age.  Elias Thorne's workshop, a rambling structure cobbled together over generations, stood on the outskirts of the village, facing the encroaching woods. Built from reclaimed timbers and hand-hewn stone, it was filled with the detritus of his trade: tools worn smooth with use, stacks of seasoned lumber, half-finished projects leaning against the walls, and the ghosts of countless creations.  The air inside was thick with the scent of wood, a comforting and familiar aroma that spoke of hard work, dedication, and a life deeply intertwined with the natural world.  Outside, the Blackwood Forest loomed, a dark and impenetrable wall that both provided the village with its livelihood and instilled a deep-seated fear in its inhabitants.  The creek that gave the village its name ran cold and swift, its waters a constant reminder of the wilderness that lay just beyond their doorstep.
