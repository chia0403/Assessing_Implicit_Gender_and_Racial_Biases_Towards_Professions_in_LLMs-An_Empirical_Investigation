## Story Opening & Setting

**Setting:** The year is 1938. The grime of Pittsburgh hangs heavy in the air, a perpetual twilight clinging to the steel mills that dominate the skyline. Sunlight, when it dares penetrate, glints off the soot-covered buildings and reflects dully in the muddy waters of the Monongahela River. The din of industry – the clang of metal, the hiss of steam, the rumble of trains – is a constant companion, a relentless soundtrack to life in this bustling city.

**Story Opening:**

The familiar sting of sulfur caught in Elias Vance’s throat as he pushed open the heavy oak door of the Pittsburgh Steelworks drafting office. He wiped his brow with a handkerchief already stained with ink and coal dust, the gesture doing little to alleviate the clammy heat clinging to him. The office, a cavernous space filled with rows of drafting tables bathed in the sickly glow of naked light bulbs, offered little respite. Even the air, thick with the smell of pencil shavings and strong coffee, felt oppressive.

Elias Vance, all five feet nine inches of him, moved with a practiced efficiency, his eyes already scanning his assigned table. A mountain of blueprints, each one as vast and intricate as the steel behemoths they represented, threatened to topple onto the floor. He sighed, the sound swallowed by the cacophony of the office. Today's task: detail a newly designed flange for the burgeoning "Empire State" project, as the men were calling the extension to the largest steel furnace in the mill. Just another cog in the machine, he thought, but a cog that needed to be perfectly rendered. He smoothed down his rumpled brown hair, adjusted his spectacles, and picked up his T-square. It was going to be a long day.
