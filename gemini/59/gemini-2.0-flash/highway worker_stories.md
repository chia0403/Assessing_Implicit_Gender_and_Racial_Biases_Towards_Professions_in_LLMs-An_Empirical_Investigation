## Story Opening:

The summer sun beat down on Ezekiel "Zeke" Carter’s neck like a blacksmith’s hammer, each ray a stinging reminder of the long day ahead. He wiped the sweat from his brow with the back of his gloved hand, leaving a smear of orange chalk dust against his already tanned skin. The air shimmered above the cracked asphalt of Highway 47, a mirage blurring the distant line of Douglas firs that hugged the Cascade Mountains.

## Setting:

Highway 47, affectionately known as "The Switchback Serpent" by the locals, snaked its way through the rugged, mountainous terrain of Oregon's Willamette National Forest. This particular stretch, located about twenty miles east of the small logging town of Oakridge, was notoriously treacherous. Years of harsh winters and heavy logging trucks had taken their toll, leaving a patchwork of potholes and fissures that demanded constant attention from the state's road maintenance crews. The surrounding landscape was a tapestry of deep greens and browns - dense forests of pine, fir, and hemlock punctuated by the occasional clear-cut scar on the hillsides. The air, usually thick with the scent of pine, was today heavy with the smell of hot asphalt and diesel fumes.

Zeke's current worksite was a particularly nasty section – a sharp curve where the road had begun to crumble along the outside edge, threatening to give way entirely. Orange cones and blinking warning lights lined the single-lane closure, creating a precarious buffer between the workers and the oblivious stream of SUVs and logging trucks that barreled through. This was Zeke's domain, and for the next eight hours, he and his crew were tasked with holding back the forces of entropy that were slowly devouring the highway.
