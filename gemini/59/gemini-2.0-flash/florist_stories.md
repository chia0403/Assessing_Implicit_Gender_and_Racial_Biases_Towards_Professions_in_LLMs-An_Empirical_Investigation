## Story Opening:

The scent of lilies, sharp and cloying, hung heavy in the air, a perfume that clung to Amelia Grace Hawthorne like a second skin. Amelia pinched the bridge of her nose, trying to ward off the headache that always threatened when she spent too long surrounded by funeral arrangements. Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across Willow Creek, but inside "Petal & Stem," her little flower shop, the gloom persisted, mirroring the somber occasion for which she was preparing. She snipped a thorny rose stem, the sharp prick a welcome sting against the encroaching melancholy. It was her fault, really. She shouldn't have taken on the Winslow funeral; it was too big, too overwhelming, especially when the details still whispered on the wind, rumors and accusations clinging to the circumstances of old Mr. Winslow's untimely demise. Amelia sighed. A good florist shouldn't be so sensitive. A good florist should just arrange the flowers and collect the check. But Amelia Grace Hawthorne had never been just a good florist. She felt things, saw things, in the delicate curve of a petal, in the subtle droop of a wilting stem. And right now, the flowers were telling her a story she wasn't sure she wanted to hear.

## Setting:

**Petal & Stem** is a small, independent flower shop nestled in the heart of Willow Creek, a picturesque town nestled at the foot of the Blue Ridge Mountains in North Carolina. The shop itself is a converted Victorian house, painted a cheerful robin's egg blue, though the paint is peeling in places, revealing patches of faded white beneath. Wrought iron window boxes overflow with geraniums and petunias in vibrant hues, a stark contrast to the more muted tones of the surrounding buildings.

Inside, the shop is a riot of color and fragrance. Bouquets of every imaginable flower imaginable, from classic red roses to exotic orchids, jostle for space on shelves and tables. Antique watering cans and vintage pottery hold smaller arrangements, adding to the shop's quirky charm. The back room, where Amelia creates her larger arrangements, is perpetually cluttered with ribbons, vases, and discarded stems, a testament to her passion and dedication. The air is thick with the mingled scents of blooming flowers, damp earth, and a faint undercurrent of floral preservative. A chipped porcelain sign above the cash register reads, "Petal & Stem: Where Flowers Tell a Story," a promise Amelia takes seriously.
