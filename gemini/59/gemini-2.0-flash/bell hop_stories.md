## Story Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

The first hint that something was profoundly off came with the luggage. Not the quantity, mind you. Plenty of guests checked into the Grand Majestic Hotel with enough baggage to populate a small village. No, it was the *quality* of the luggage. Antiquated, battered leather trunks, the kind you’d expect to see disembarking from a steamship, sat precariously stacked on a polished brass trolley, smelling faintly of mothballs and something indefinably…ancient. As he wheeled them towards Suite 404, Barnaby Theodore Finch, veteran bellhop of the Grand Majestic, couldn’t shake the feeling that he wasn’t just transporting luggage, but a whole forgotten century.

**Setting:**

The Grand Majestic Hotel, a behemoth of Art Deco architecture, stood proudly overlooking the grimy glamour of late-night downtown Zenith City. Built in the roaring twenties, it had once been *the* place to see and be seen, a glittering haven for socialites, industrialists, and even, rumor had it, the occasional gangster. Though its luster had dulled somewhat over the decades, replaced by a more muted, almost mournful elegance, it still held a certain allure. The lobby was a cathedral of marble and mirrors, echoing with the faint melodies of a live jazz trio tucked away in the dimly lit “Crimson Lounge.” Ornately framed portraits of long-forgotten celebrities lined the walls, their eyes seeming to follow Barnaby as he traversed the patterned carpets. The air, thick with the scent of lilies and old money, always carried a hint of something else, something inexplicable, that Barnaby could only describe as "history breathing."
