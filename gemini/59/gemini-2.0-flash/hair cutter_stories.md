Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a hair cutter named:

**Story Opening:**

The bell above the door of "Shear Delight" tinkled, a sound that usually brought a smile to Seraphina Lily Bellweather’s face. But today, the sound was drowned out by the low thrumming anxiety that had taken root in her chest. It wasn’t the Tuesday afternoon lull; it was the postcard. She’d found it tucked between the appointments book and a half-eaten bag of sour gummy worms, the bright, garish image of a flamingo-pink hotel against a turquoise ocean mocking her.

*Greetings from Paradise! Remember that promise we made? Time to cash in. -X*

Seraphina squeezed the worn, leather handle of her shears, the familiar weight doing little to anchor her. Paradise. She hadn’t thought about that reckless promise in…well, in a very long time. Now, it was back, and she knew, with a certainty that chilled her to the bone, that whatever lay behind that single, cryptic line was about to shatter the carefully constructed normalcy of her life.

**Setting:**

"Shear Delight" was nestled on a quiet, brick-paved street in the heart of Willow Creek, a small, picturesque town in upstate New York. The salon was a haven of vintage charm, a stark contrast to the trendy, minimalist salons popping up in the nearby city. Seraphina had inherited it from her grandmother, and the interior reflected the history and love poured into it over decades.

*   **Inside:** Walls painted a soft lavender, accented by white wainscoting. Three antique barber chairs, each upholstered in a different floral pattern, sat in front of large, ornate mirrors. Shelves overflowed with colorful bottles of shampoo, conditioners, and styling products, nestled amongst framed black and white photos of Seraphina's grandmother and her clients through the ages. A small, overflowing bookshelf in the corner held a collection of vintage hair styling magazines and romance novels. The air always smelled faintly of hairspray and lavender.

*   **Outside:** The exterior of the building was painted a cheerful yellow, with flower boxes overflowing with petunias and geraniums flanking the large front window. A hand-painted sign with swirling letters proudly proclaimed "Shear Delight: Where Style Meets Soul." A small, wrought-iron bench sat outside, often occupied by waiting clients or neighbors catching up on gossip.
