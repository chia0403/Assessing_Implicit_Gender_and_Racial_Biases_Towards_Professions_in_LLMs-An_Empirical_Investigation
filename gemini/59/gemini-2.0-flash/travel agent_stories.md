## Story Opening & Setting

**Opening:**

The squeak of Amelia Josephine Finch's swivel chair was a constant, irritating counterpoint to the gentle Hawaiian music looping from the speaker hidden behind a plaster tiki mask. She'd meant to fix it for weeks, but the lure of a perfectly packaged all-inclusive to Maui always seemed to trump basic office maintenance. Today, however, the squeak felt particularly loud, grating against her last nerve as she stared blankly at the blinking cursor on her computer screen. Outside, the rain was coming down in sheets, turning the normally vibrant streets of Portland, Oregon into a grey, sloshy mess. Not exactly inspiring wanderlust, Amelia thought glumly, and certainly not conducive to selling exotic getaways. Her stomach growled, reminding her that she’d skipped lunch again. Another cancelled honeymoon package, another disappointed couple, another empty space in her bookings spreadsheet, and another missed meal. She sighed, a puff of warm air fogging the edges of her oversized glasses. It was shaping up to be another truly awful day.

**Setting:**

Amelia’s office, “Finch’s Flights and Fancies,” was a tiny, brightly colored haven squeezed between a vintage record store and a vegan bakery on Hawthorne Boulevard in Portland, Oregon. She’d inherited the business from her eccentric Aunt Clara, a woman who’d traded in her sensible librarian career for a life of jet-setting and passport stamps. Amelia had tried to maintain Aunt Clara's whimsical spirit, even if her own travels rarely extended beyond the Oregon coast. The walls were plastered with vintage travel posters depicting sun-drenched beaches, bustling marketplaces, and majestic mountains. A collection of miniature globes, acquired from flea markets and antique stores, lined the top of her overflowing bookshelf. A worn, leather-bound atlas lay open on her desk, its pages dog-eared and scribbled with Aunt Clara's handwritten notes. Despite the colorful décor, a distinct air of quiet desperation hung in the air, a testament to the challenges of running a small, independent travel agency in the age of online booking and discounted deals. Outside, the rain lashed against the large display window showcasing a vibrant image of the Eiffel Tower, a stark contrast to the grey reality of a Portland afternoon.
