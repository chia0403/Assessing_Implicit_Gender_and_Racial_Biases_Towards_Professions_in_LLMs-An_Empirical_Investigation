The flickering fluorescent lights of Mac's Garage hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the raucous screech of an impact wrench biting into a rusted lug nut. Grease clung to everything, a patina of black and brown that coated even the air itself. Tools hung haphazardly on a pegboard, their silhouettes casting jagged shadows on the concrete wall, a chaotic masterpiece born of years of hurried repairs.

In the heart of this greasy kingdom, Evelyn "Evie" Grace Hamilton grunted with effort, her brow furrowed in concentration. Strands of auburn hair, escaping her bandana, stuck to her forehead as she wrestled with the stubborn nut. She adjusted her safety glasses, the lenses smudged with fingerprints despite her best efforts. The smell of burnt rubber, exhaust fumes, and WD-40 permeated the air, a scent Evie found oddly comforting, a perfume of progress. This was her domain, her sanctuary, where the grumbles of engines spoke to her more clearly than human voices.

This was Harmony Creek, population 1,842, a town nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, where time seemed to move a little slower and a reliable car was less a luxury and more a necessity. And if your reliable car decided to throw a tantrum, chances are it ended up in Evie's capable, albeit grease-stained, hands.
