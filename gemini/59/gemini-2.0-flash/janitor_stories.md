The squeak of rubber soles against the polished linoleum was the only sound for miles, or at least, it felt that way. Outside, the obsidian sky pressed close to the towering chrome and glass facade of the Zenith Corporation headquarters. Inside, in the desolate expanse of the 42nd floor, only the hum of the building's ventilation system kept Arthur Percival Butterfield company.

Arthur Percival Butterfield, a man whose life was as unassuming as his name, paused in front of the panoramic window. He ran a weary hand across the expanse of glass, removing a smudge he hadn't even noticed before. The city sprawled beneath him, a chaotic tapestry of light and shadow, ambition and despair. He could see the faint flicker of neon signs, the endless stream of traffic, and the distant glint of the river snaking its way through the urban jungle. He wondered, as he often did, if any of the thousands of people buzzing around down there ever looked up and considered the lonely man cleaning their office windows.

The Zenith Corporation, a monolithic entity that dealt in secrets and untold fortunes, was Arthur’s kingdom after hours. He was the silent guardian of discarded coffee cups, the vanquisher of errant crumbs, and the unsung hero who ensured that everything was pristine and ready for the titans of industry to conquer the world again in the morning. Tonight, though, the usual quiet hum was replaced by a strange, almost imperceptible, vibration that resonated deep within Arthur's bones. Something was different. Something was… off.
