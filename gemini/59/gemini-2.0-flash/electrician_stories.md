The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, stinging Elias Thorne's cheeks and making his eyes water as he wrestled with the frozen metal clasp of the electrical box. The pre-dawn grey was thick as a shroud, barely illuminating the dilapidated Ferris wheel looming over him on Navy Pier. Above, skeletal fingers of iron reached into the swirling snow, a silent, rusted testament to summers long past. He cursed under his breath, his breath puffing out in white clouds. Christmas Eve, and here he was, dangling precariously from a cherry picker, trying to coax a dying strand of lights back to life.

Elias Thorne, licensed electrician and begrudging hero of last-minute holiday crises, hated heights. He hated the cold even more. And he definitely hated the way the wind made the metal of the cherry picker whine a mournful song. He knew he should be home, nursing a mug of hot chocolate and watching his niece unwrap presents on a grainy video call. Instead, he was thirty feet in the air, trying to prevent a hundred disappointed children from waking up on Christmas morning to a dark, lifeless Pier. He just hoped the overtime pay would be worth it.
