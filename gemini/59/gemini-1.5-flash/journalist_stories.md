The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Mia" Holloway's auburn hair across her face as she hunched deeper into her threadbare coat.  Rain, sleeting now, plastered the already sodden newspaper she clutched to her chest, the headline – *Vanishing Act on Bleakmoor Moor* – blurring under the relentless downpour.  Bleakmoor Moor itself sprawled before her, a vast, desolate expanse of heather and peat bogs under a bruised, pewter sky.  The only sound louder than the wind's mournful howl was the rhythmic drumming of rain against the ancient, moss-covered stones of the crumbling Drybridge, the only visible landmark for miles.  Mia shivered, not entirely from the cold. This wasn't just another missing person's case; the whispers following this disappearance spoke of something far older, far more sinister, lurking in the shadows of the moor.
