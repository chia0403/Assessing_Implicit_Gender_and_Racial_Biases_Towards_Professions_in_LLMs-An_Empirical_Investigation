The chill wind whipped off the North Sea, biting at Bartholomew "Barty" Butchers' exposed knuckles as he hauled a side of beef onto his chopping block.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and sawdust, hung heavy in the butcher shop, a narrow, timber-framed building clinging precariously to the edge of the Whitby harbour.  Salt spray speckled the cobblestones outside, and the cries of gulls mingled with the rhythmic clang of Barty's cleaver, a sound as familiar to the town as the crashing waves themselves.  The year was 1888, and the fishing boats, their sails like tattered flags against the bruised twilight sky, were just beginning to return from their day's toil, promising a fresh influx of customers and the pungent aroma of recently caught cod to further enrich the already potent atmosphere of Barty's shop, "Butchers & Sons â€“ Quality Meats Since 1776."
