The sterile scent of antiseptic and the low hum of the suction machine were the soundtrack to Anya Sharma’s Tuesday morning.  Anya, a woman whose smile could rival the pearly whites she meticulously cleaned all day, leaned back against the cool porcelain sink in Dr. Albright's office, scrubbing at a stubborn stain of grape jelly from a particularly tenacious scaler.  The small, independent dental practice, nestled on the cobbled side street of a quaint New England town called Havenwood, was quiet – unusually so. The usually frantic Tuesday morning rush had been replaced by an unnerving stillness, broken only by the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the waiting room, its pendulum swinging with a morbid deliberation that Anya found unsettling.  Outside, the autumn leaves, vibrant hues of crimson and gold, swirled in a restless wind that seemed to whisper secrets through the frosted glass windows. This wasn't just a quiet Tuesday; it felt like the calm before a very particular storm.
