The rasping cough that wracked Elias Thorne’s chest echoed through the pre-dawn stillness of Widow’s Creek Valley.  Frost clung to the stubble of his barley field like icy diamonds, catching the weak light of the rising sun.  Elias, his breath misting in the frigid air, leaned heavily on his weathered walking stick, its gnarled wood mirroring the lines etched deep into his face.  The valley, normally a cradle of quiet beauty, felt today like a tomb, its muted colours dulled by the pervasive grey of a coming storm.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, held a deeper, unsettling tang – the metallic scent of blood.  He hadn’t seen a wild animal this far down the valley in years, and the feeling that something was terribly wrong settled cold in his gut, heavier than the frost on his boots.
