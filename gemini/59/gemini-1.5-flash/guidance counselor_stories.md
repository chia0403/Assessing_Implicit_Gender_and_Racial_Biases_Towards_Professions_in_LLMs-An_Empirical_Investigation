The chipped paint of the "Guidance" sign on Ms. Eleanor Vance's door was a perfect metaphor for the state of Northwood High.  Cracked, faded, and clinging on by a thread, just like the hopes of many of the students who shuffled through its threshold.  Eleanor, with her sensible cardigan and perpetually tired but kind eyes, sat behind her cluttered desk, the scent of stale coffee and despair hanging heavy in the air. Rain lashed against the windows of her small office, mirroring the tempestuous emotions brewing within the walls of the aging brick building. Outside, the late afternoon sun struggled to break through the grey, mirroring the lack of brightness in the lives of some of her students.  This was Northwood High, a place where dreams went to die, or at least, to get seriously bruised.  And Eleanor Vance was their unlikely, weary champion.
