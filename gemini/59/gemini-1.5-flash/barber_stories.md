The scent of Bay Rum and stale coffee hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Bartholomew "Barty" Higgins, proprietor of Higgins' Hair Emporium.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single, weak bulb hanging above the chipped porcelain sink, danced in the afternoon gloom that filtered through the grimy windowpanes of his shop.  Outside, the relentless November rain hammered against the faded red awning, a soundtrack to the quiet hum of the clippers Barty held, momentarily still in his hand.  His shop, tucked away on a cobbled side street in the less-than-picturesque district of Grimsborough, was a testament to perseverance â€“ and a shocking lack of recent renovations.  The worn leather barber's chair creaked a mournful protest under the weight of its current occupant, a burly dockworker with a week's worth of grime under his fingernails.  Barty sighed, the sound swallowed by the rhythmic drumming of the rain.  Another quiet day in Grimsborough, another collection of stories waiting to be snipped, shaved, and revealed along with the stray hairs clinging to the worn neck strip.
