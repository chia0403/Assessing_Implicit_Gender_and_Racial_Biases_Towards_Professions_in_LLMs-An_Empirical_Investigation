The scent of argan oil and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Seraphina "Sera" Moreau.  Rain lashed against the oversized windows of "Shear Perfection," her salon nestled on a cobbled side street in the heart of Prague’s Old Town.  Gas lamps flickered outside, casting an amber glow on the wet stones and reflecting in the polished mahogany of her antique styling chairs.  Inside, the salon hummed with a low, comforting thrum – the whir of a hairdryer battling the storm, the gentle snip of scissors, and the hushed murmur of satisfied clients.  Sera, her fingers stained a delicate lilac from a recent dye job, surveyed her kingdom with a practiced eye, a half-finished cappuccino cooling beside a meticulously arranged display of organic hair products.  Tonight, however, the usual soothing calm was disrupted by a frantic phone call that promised anything but tranquility.
