The rusty swing set groaned a mournful tune in the biting November wind, its chains rattling like skeletal fingers against the peeling paint of the Victorian house.  Rain, a relentless, icy drizzle, plastered Amelia “Amy” Blackwood’s already-damp hair to her forehead.  Amy, a plumber whose calloused hands were more accustomed to wrestling with stubborn pipes than battling the elements, shivered, pulling her worn fleece jacket tighter.  The house before her, a crumbling testament to forgotten grandeur, loomed like a gothic specter under the bruised twilight sky.  Number 13 Grimwald Lane.  Not exactly the kind of address that inspired confidence, especially on a night like this.  The flickering porch light cast long, distorted shadows that danced and writhed with the wind, making the already unsettling scene feel even more sinister.  The only sound besides the wind and rain was the rhythmic drip, drip, drip from a broken gutter – a miniature, melancholic symphony foreshadowing the plumbing disaster that awaited her inside.
