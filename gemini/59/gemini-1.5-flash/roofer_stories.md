The biting November wind howled a mournful tune around Elias Thorne, whipping his already-chapped lips raw.  Below him, the city of Oakhaven sprawled like a rumpled, grey carpet, the individual houses mere blocks of colour in the fading light.  Elias, perched precariously on the steeply-pitched roof of a Victorian mansion, adjusted his worn leather gloves, the cold seeping through the aged material.  The last rays of sun, a bruised purple, painted the sky, casting long shadows that danced with the swaying shingles.  The air, thick with the scent of damp leaves and woodsmoke, carried the distant clang of a church bell, a melancholic counterpoint to the rhythmic thud of Elias’s hammer as he secured the final slate.  Tonight, at least, the leaky roof of Mrs. Albright’s prized possession would be safe from the elements.  But Elias knew, with a sigh that was lost in the wind, that his own precarious situation was far from secure.
