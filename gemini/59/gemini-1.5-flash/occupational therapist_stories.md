The salt spray stung Dr. Eleanor Vance's face as she wrestled the stubborn fishing boat door open, the metallic tang a stark contrast to the sterile scent of antiseptic she usually associated with her work.  The wind, a relentless banshee, howled across the craggy cliffs of the Isle of Skye, whipping her auburn braid across her cheek.  Below, the churning grey sea gnawed at the jagged rocks, a relentless, unforgiving beast. Eleanor, however, was not deterred. Her weathered tweed coat, pulled tight against the gale, offered little protection from the elements, but it did nothing to dampen the steely determination in her grey eyes.  She was here, on this remote, windswept island, not to tend to broken bones, but to mend something far more fragile â€“ the shattered spirit of a young man named Lachlan MacLeod.  The tiny, ramshackle fishing village of Portree huddled below, a cluster of brightly coloured houses clinging precariously to the hillside, a testament to the resilience of its inhabitants, a resilience Eleanor hoped to help Lachlan rediscover.
