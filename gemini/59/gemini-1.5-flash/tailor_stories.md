The scent of aged cedarwood and lavender hung heavy in the air, a fragrant shroud clinging to the dust motes dancing in the single shaft of sunlight slicing through the grimy window of Silas Blackwood's tailoring establishment.  Silas, a man whose life was measured in the precise stitches of his needle and the subtle drape of a perfectly tailored garment, sat hunched over his workbench, the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of his shears a counterpoint to the mournful groan of the city outside.  Rain lashed against the windowpanes of his small shop, nestled on a cobbled alleyway in the shadow of the imposing St. Jude's Cathedral in the perpetually overcast city of Porthaven.  The air, thick with the smell of brine and coal smoke, hinted at the bustling port just beyond the cathedral walls, a world Silas knew existed but rarely ventured into. His world was one of fine fabrics, precise measurements, and the quiet satisfaction of transforming rough cloth into elegant masterpieces.
