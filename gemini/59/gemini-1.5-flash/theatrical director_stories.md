The chipped porcelain teacup trembled in Seraphina “Sera” Blackwood’s hand, mirroring the tremor of anxiety in her chest.

The Grand Majestic Theatre, a once-glittering jewel of the city's theatrical scene, now felt less like a stage for dreams and more like a mausoleum for forgotten ambitions.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light slicing through the gloom, illuminating the decaying grandeur: faded velvet curtains, cracked plaster cherubs clinging precariously to the ceiling, and the ghostly scent of stale popcorn and a thousand forgotten performances hanging heavy in the air.  Sera, with her fiery red hair escaping its haphazard bun and eyes the colour of a stormy sea, surveyed the scene with a mixture of despair and stubborn determination. The premiere of her ambitious new production, "The Obsidian Mirror," was only three weeks away, and the only thing more precarious than the theatre's structure was its funding.
