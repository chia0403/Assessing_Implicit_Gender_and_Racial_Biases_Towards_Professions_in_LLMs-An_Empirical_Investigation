The dawn mist clung to the manicured lawns of Blackwood Manor like a shroud, clinging to the dew-kissed blades of grass and obscuring the intricate topiary until the rising sun finally burned it away.

The scent of damp earth and freshly cut hedges filled his lungs, a familiar aroma that spoke of routine, of peace, and of a life lived largely unseen, yet vital to the grand estate that dominated the rolling Hampshire countryside.
