The relentless Florida sun beat down on Serenity Palms Fitness Center, turning the glass facade into a shimmering mirage.  Sweat, the pungent aroma of exertion and expensive coconut-scented cleaning products, hung heavy in the air.  Inside, amidst the rhythmic thud of treadmills and the chirping of motivational workout music, Amelia “Mia” Hernandez adjusted the microphone, her dark hair pulled back in a practical braid that escaped the confines of its clip with every vigorous movement.  Mia, a whirlwind of energy contained within a compact five-foot-four frame, surveyed her Zumba class – a kaleidoscope of Lycra and determined faces – her smile both fierce and encouraging.  The air conditioning battled valiantly against the outside heat, a silent duel that only amplified the already fervent energy of the room. Today's class promised to be extra fiery; it was the day before the annual Serenity Palms fitness competition, and the tension was palpable, almost as thick as the humidity.
