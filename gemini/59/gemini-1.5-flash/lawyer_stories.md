The chipped paint of the fire escape flaked onto Amelia “Mia” Hernandez’s crisp white blouse, a tiny, ironic snowfall against the oppressive July heat clinging to the Brooklyn brownstone.  Sweat beaded on her forehead, mirroring the condensation clinging to the lukewarm coffee in her hand.  Below, the street thrummed with the usual cacophony of honking taxis, shouting vendors, and the rhythmic pulse of a salsa band spilling out from a nearby bodega.  The air, thick with the scent of frying plantains and exhaust fumes, did little to improve Mia's already foul mood.  Her perfectly tailored suit, a testament to her hard-earned success at the prestigious firm of Sterling & Vance, felt more like a suffocating straitjacket than a symbol of power.  This wasn't some air-conditioned courtroom; this was a messy, human, real-life mess, and Mia Hernandez, attorney at law, was knee-deep in it.
