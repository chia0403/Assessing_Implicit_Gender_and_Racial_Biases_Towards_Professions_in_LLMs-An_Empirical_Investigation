The humid Louisiana air hung heavy, thick with the scent of honeysuckle and something faintlyâ€¦rotten.  Dr. Evangeline Dubois, her crisp white lab coat clinging damply to her skin, stared out the rain-streaked window of her dental practice, "Dubois Dental," perched precariously on stilts above the bayou.

Inside, the office hummed with the low thrum of the air conditioning struggling against the oppressive heat, a stark contrast to the wild, untamed beauty just beyond the glass.  The only sound louder than the AC was the relentless drumming of rain against the corrugated metal roof.  Evangeline sighed, the Louisiana humidity weighing on her as much as the unanswered questions swirling in her mind. Tonight, a patient's cryptic words echoed in her ears, words that had nothing to do with cavities and everything to do with a mystery steeped in the murky depths of the bayou itself.
