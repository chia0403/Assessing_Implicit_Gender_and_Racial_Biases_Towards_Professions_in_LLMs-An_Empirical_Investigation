The biting November wind whipped across the desolate stretch of Interstate 70, stinging Elias Thorne's cheeks raw.  Elias, a man whose hands were as rough as bark and whose face bore the roadmap of a thousand sunrises and sunsets spent battling the elements, gripped his shovel tighter.  The asphalt ribbon unfurled before him, a dark scar across the Wyoming landscape, punctuated only by the occasional wind-battered sagebrush and the distant, snow-capped peaks of the Medicine Bow Mountains.  The air smelled of diesel fumes, frozen earth, and the faint, metallic tang of spilled oil â€“ the familiar, pungent aroma of his life.  Today, however, the usual hum of passing traffic was muted, a rare quiet broken only by the rhythmic crunch of his shovel against the frozen ground as he repaired a pothole that threatened to swallow a tire whole.  Even the crows seemed to have retreated from the brutal wind, leaving Elias alone with the vast, unforgiving beauty of the high plains.
