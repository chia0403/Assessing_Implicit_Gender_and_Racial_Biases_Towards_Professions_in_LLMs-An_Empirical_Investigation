The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful song across the frozen tundra, whipping snow into a frenzy around Captain Evelyn "Evie" Reed's battered Cessna 185.  The single-engine plane, affectionately nicknamed "The Ice Queen," was parked precariously on a sliver of ice-covered lake, its aluminum skin frosted with a layer of rime that glittered faintly under the weak, pale sun.  The air hung thick with the scent of pine and the sharp tang of arctic air, a familiar perfume to Evie, but one that held a chilling undercurrent this morning.  The radio crackled with static, a lonely counterpoint to the wind's relentless wail, and Evie knew, with a sinking feeling in her gut, that this rescue mission was going to be anything but routine.
