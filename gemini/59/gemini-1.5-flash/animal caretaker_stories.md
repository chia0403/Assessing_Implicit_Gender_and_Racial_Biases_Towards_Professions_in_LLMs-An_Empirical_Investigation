The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Mia" Hawthorne's hair across her face as she wrestled a recalcitrant bale of hay.  The scent of damp earth and pine needles, usually comforting, was overwhelmed tonight by the sharp tang of impending snow.  The air hung heavy with it, a promise of icy stillness settling over the sprawling grounds of Blackwood Manor Animal Sanctuary, its ancient stone walls silhouetted against the bruised purple of the twilight sky.  Mia, bundled in layers of wool and fleece, barely registered the cold; her focus was entirely on securing the last of the winter feed for the sanctuary's resident bison, a grumpy old bull named Boris who had a penchant for escaping and a surprisingly refined taste for the choicest alfalfa. The sanctuary, perched precariously on a windswept hill overlooking a frozen lake, felt more isolated than usual this evening, a place both beautiful and utterly unforgiving.
