The aroma of vanilla bean and almond extract hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the chill November rain lashing against the windowpanes of "Sweet Surrender," Amelia Grace Hawthorne's cake decorating studio.  Water streamed down the glass, blurring the already indistinct view of the cobblestone street outside. Inside, however, was a vibrant explosion of color: swirling buttercream roses in shades of blush pink and ivory, meticulously piped chocolate leaves, and a half-finished masterpiece â€“ a three-tiered cake depicting a whimsical castle, its turrets frosted in a dazzling silver.  Amelia, her fingers dusted with powdered sugar and her apron stained with a rainbow of food coloring, carefully applied a tiny, perfectly formed edible pearl to the castle's highest spire.  The rain continued its relentless drumming, a counterpoint to the soft hum of her electric mixer, a comforting rhythm in her otherwise solitary world.
