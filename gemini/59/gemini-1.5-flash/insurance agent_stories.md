The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia “Mia” Holloway’s hands, a meager defense against the November chill that clawed its way through the drafty windows of her office.  Rain lashed against the glass, blurring the already indistinct view of the grey, rain-slicked streets of Port Blossom, Oregon.  The town itself, nestled between the brooding peaks of the Cascade Mountains and the restless Pacific Ocean, was as perpetually damp as Mia’s perpetually damp spirits.  Her small, independent insurance agency, "Holloway & Hope," (the "Hope" part a touch of optimistic branding that felt increasingly ironic these days), occupied a space above a failing bakery, the scent of stale sourdough a constant, faintly melancholic undercurrent to her workday. The only cheerful element in the room was a vibrant, almost offensively cheerful, sunflower painting – a gift from her optimistic, but ultimately unhelpful, mother.  Today, however, even the sunflower seemed to droop under the weight of the impending storm, both meteorological and metaphorical.
