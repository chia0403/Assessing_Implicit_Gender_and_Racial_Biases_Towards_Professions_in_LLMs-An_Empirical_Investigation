The chipped paint on the windowsill, a faded robin's egg blue that clashed violently with the aggressively orange brickwork, was the first thing Seraphina "Sera" Montgomery noticed.  It was a detail, a tiny imperfection, but to Sera, a detail was everything.  The entire house – a rambling Victorian in the heart of Notting Hill, swallowed by an unruly tangle of wisteria – screamed of neglected potential, a symphony of discordant colours and textures crying out for her expert touch. The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and forgotten dreams, hung heavy with the weight of years, a palpable layer of dust clinging to every surface. Sunlight, fractured by the overgrown ivy, sliced through the gloom, illuminating motes dancing in the stillness.  This wasn't just a renovation; this was a rescue mission.  And Sera Montgomery, armed with her trusty paint swatches and a caffeine-fueled determination, was just the woman for the job.
