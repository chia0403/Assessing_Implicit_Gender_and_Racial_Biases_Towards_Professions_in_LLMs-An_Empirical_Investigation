The chipped porcelain sink wept rusty tears onto the cracked linoleum floor, mirroring the state of Seraphina Evangeline Bellweather’s heart.  Rain lashed against the single, grimy window of her cramped, attic apartment, each gust a mournful sigh echoing the melody trapped in her throat.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single bare bulb hanging precariously overhead, danced in the weak light like reluctant spirits clinging to the memories of a forgotten glory.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee, damp plaster, and the faint, lingering perfume of a forgotten performance – a ghost of sandalwood and rose that clung stubbornly to the worn velvet curtain she used as a makeshift sound barrier.  This was her sanctuary, her prison, her stage – a tiny, crumbling attic room overlooking the perpetually rain-soaked streets of  Greyhaven, a city that had once promised her the world, and now seemed determined to swallow her whole.
