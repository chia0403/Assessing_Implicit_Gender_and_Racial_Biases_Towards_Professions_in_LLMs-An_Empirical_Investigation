The chipped paint of the "Welcome to Ms. Eleanor Vance's Class!" sign flaked onto the vibrant, slightly sticky linoleum floor like a miniature, colorful snowstorm.  It was a fitting metaphor for the chaotic yet endearing energy that permeated Mrs. Eleanor Vance's kindergarten classroom at Sunny Meadows Elementary.  Crayon shavings, a testament to countless masterpieces, littered the edges of brightly colored construction paper; the air hummed with a symphony of tiny voices, a cacophony of giggles, whispers, and the insistent squeak of tiny shoes.  Sunlight streamed through the large, slightly dusty windows, illuminating the rainbow-hued artwork adorning the walls – a chaotic yet comforting kaleidoscope of handprints, finger paintings, and wobbly letters painstakingly formed by five-year-old hands. Today, however, the usual delightful chaos felt… different.  A palpable tension hung in the air, thicker than the scent of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches lingering from snack time.  Eleanor Vance, with her perpetually kind eyes and a smile that could disarm even the most stubborn tantrum, felt it too.  Something was amiss.
