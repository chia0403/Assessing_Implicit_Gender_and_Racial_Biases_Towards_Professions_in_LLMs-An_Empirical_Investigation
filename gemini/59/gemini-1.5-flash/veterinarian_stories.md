The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful symphony around Dr. Elara Vance as she wrestled the recalcitrant sled dog, a magnificent but stubborn Alaskan Malamute named Tundra, onto the examination table.  Snow, whipped into a frenzy by the gale, plastered itself against the single pane windows of the North Star Veterinary Clinic, a small, weathered wooden building perched precariously on the edge of Nome, Alaska. The air inside, despite the roaring wood stove, held a persistent chill that seemed to seep into your very bones.  The scent of pine, antiseptic, and something indefinably wild – a mixture of the frozen tundra and the animals that braved its harsh embrace – hung heavy in the air. Elara, her breath misting in the frigid air, pulled on her thick wool gloves, the faint scent of pine needles clinging to the worn leather.  Tonight, the usual quiet rhythm of the clinic was shattered by the storm’s fury, and the urgent need of a very large, very grumpy, and very snow-covered dog.
