The scent of aged mahogany and expensive leather hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma that Amelia “Mia” Hernandez had come to associate with the hushed opulence of the Grand Regency Hotel. Rain lashed against the vast, arched windows of her concierge desk, blurring the already hazy cityscape into a shimmering watercolour.  The Grand Regency, a behemoth of Gilded Age architecture clinging precariously to the edge of a bustling modern metropolis, stood as a silent testament to a bygone era, a haven of old-world charm amidst the relentless pulse of twenty-first-century New York. Mia, impeccably dressed in a charcoal grey suit that somehow managed to be both stylish and practical, surveyed her domain with a practiced eye.  Tonight, the usual quiet hum of the lobby was punctuated by the rhythmic drumming of rain and the occasional muffled sob from behind the potted palms.  It was a night for secrets, she knew, the kind that whispered from shadowed corners and arrived discreetly tucked into urgent envelopes.  And Mia Hernandez, the Grand Regency's concierge extraordinaire, was perfectly positioned to receive them.
