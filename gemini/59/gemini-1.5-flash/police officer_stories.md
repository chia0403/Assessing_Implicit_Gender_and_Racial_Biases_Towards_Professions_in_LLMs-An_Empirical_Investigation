The salt spray stung Officer Amelia Hernandez's face as she braced against the howling wind, the rhythmic crash of waves a constant, deafening percussion against the jagged cliffs of Isla Perdida.  Rain, thick and relentless, plastered her dark hair to her scalp, blurring the already indistinct outlines of the ramshackle fishing village clinging precariously to the cliff face below. The air, thick with the scent of brine and something else – something acrid and unsettling – clung to her like a shroud.  Amelia pulled her soaked collar tighter, the cheap, government-issued raincoat doing little to ward off the chill that seeped deep into her bones. This wasn't the kind of picturesque island getaway the tourist brochures promised; this was a storm-wracked purgatory, and she was stuck in the middle of it.
