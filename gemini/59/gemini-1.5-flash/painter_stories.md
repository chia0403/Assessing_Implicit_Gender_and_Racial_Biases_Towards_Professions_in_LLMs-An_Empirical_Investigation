The biting November wind whipped Amelia Katherine Stoneâ€™s auburn hair across her face as she wrestled the easel into position, its spindly legs threatening to give way on the uneven cobblestones of the Ponte Vecchio.  The Arno River, a churning, grey serpent, snaked beneath her, reflecting a sky the colour of bruised plums.  Florence, usually a tapestry woven with the warm hues of terracotta and ochre, was draped in a somber, almost melancholic, grey.  Rain threatened, promising to wash away not only the lingering autumn leaves but also the delicate washes of watercolour Amelia had painstakingly applied to her canvas just moments before.  This was her third attempt to capture the essence of the Ponte Vecchio in the twilight hour, and the relentless wind, a mischievous artist itself, was doing its best to sabotage her work.
