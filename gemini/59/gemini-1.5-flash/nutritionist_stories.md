The midday sun beat down on Dr. Eleanor Vance’s crisp white linen shirt, the heat shimmering off the dusty asphalt of the Tucson road.  Sweat beaded on her forehead, but Eleanor barely noticed.  Her focus was entirely on the dilapidated adobe building before her, its sun-bleached paint peeling like sunburnt skin.  This wasn't the gleaming, air-conditioned clinic she was used to; this was the heart of Esperanza, a small, impoverished community nestled deep within the Sonoran Desert, where her skills as a registered dietitian were desperately needed, and where her carefully-planned nutritional programs faced their greatest challenge yet.  The scent of mesquite wood smoke and something faintly spicy – perhaps chiles – hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the sterile smell of antiseptic she usually associated with her work.  This was going to be different. Very different.
