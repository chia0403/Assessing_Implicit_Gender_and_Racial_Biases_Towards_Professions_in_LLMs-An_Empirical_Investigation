The rasp of granite against steel echoed through the narrow valley, a lonely counterpoint to the ceaseless chatter of the River Avon.  Mist, thick as clotted cream, clung to the slopes of the Mendip Hills, obscuring the sun and leaving the world in a hushed, grey twilight.  Elias Thorne, his hands gnarled and stained the colour of dried blood from years spent wrestling with stubborn stone, paused his work.  The chisel, heavy in his calloused grip, slipped momentarily, leaving a shallow scratch across the face of the angel he was carving for the village church.  It was a scratch that mirrored the deeper fissure cracking through Elias's own carefully constructed peace.  The valley, usually a sanctuary, felt today like a suffocating cage.
