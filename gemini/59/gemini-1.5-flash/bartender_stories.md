The chipped Formica bar top felt cool beneath Elias Thorne's fingertips as he polished a already-gleaming glass.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows of The Rusty Mug, a persistent, drumming rhythm that mirrored the erratic beat of his own heart.  The air hung thick with the smells of stale beer, damp wool, and something faintly floral â€“ probably the cheap, over-sprayed perfume of the woman nursing a whiskey sour three stools down.  Outside, the neon sign flickered intermittently, casting a lurid, emerald glow on the rain-slicked alleyway, a perpetually damp canvas for the city's unseen shadows.  This was Elias's kingdom, a small, dimly lit haven tucked away on a forgotten corner of Bleecker Street, where secrets spilled as freely as the liquor he served.  Tonight, however, felt different.  The usual comforting hum of drunken chatter was muted, replaced by an unsettling silence, broken only by the rhythmic drumming of the rain and the occasional, mournful sigh of the wind.
