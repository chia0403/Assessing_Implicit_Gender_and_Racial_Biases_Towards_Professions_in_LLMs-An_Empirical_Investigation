The biting Antarctic wind howled a mournful dirge across the desolate expanse of ice, whipping snow into frenzied, swirling dervishes.  Dr. Aris Thorne, his breath clouding in the frigid air, adjusted the thermal goggles perched on his frost-nipped nose.

He was miles from the research station, a tiny, vulnerable speck in a landscape that had swallowed entire expeditions without a trace.  The air, thin and razor sharp, tasted of ice and the faint, metallic tang of ozone. This was no ordinary research trip; this was a desperate gamble, a race against the encroaching darkness – both literal and metaphorical – and the discovery that threatened to rewrite everything he knew about the planet.
