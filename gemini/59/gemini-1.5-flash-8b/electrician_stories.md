The flickering fluorescent lights of the abandoned factory hummed a mournful tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic drip, drip, drip of water seeping from a rusted pipe high in the cavernous ceiling.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of pale sunlight slicing through a shattered window, illuminating Amelia  "Sparky"  Fitzwilliamâ€™s grimy face.  She, a seasoned electrician with calloused hands and eyes that had seen more wiring diagrams than most people had seen stars, crouched beneath a tangle of corroded copper and broken insulation.  The air, thick with the smell of ozone and mildew, clung to her like a damp shroud.  This was her sanctuary, or rather, her battleground.  The dilapidated factory, once a humming heart of industrial might, was now a graveyard of forgotten machinery, a labyrinth waiting to trap the unwary.

The setting:  The rusted skeleton of the "Ironclad Industries" factory,  located on the outskirts of the decaying industrial district of Steelhaven, a city choked by the legacy of its once-mighty steel mills.  Dust coated everything, from the chipped paint on the towering brick walls to the skeletal remains of forgotten conveyors.  The factory was a monument to neglect, a testament to the city's slow, agonizing decline, a place where the ghosts of forgotten machinery whispered tales of forgotten innovation.
