The flickering fluorescent lights of the Economy Class cabin hummed a monotonous lullaby, a stark contrast to the tempest brewing in Amelia Blackwood's chest.  The recycled air, thick with the scent of stale coffee and cheap perfume, felt like a physical weight pressing down on her.  She adjusted the frayed edge of her uniform, a seafoam green that seemed to mock the dull grey of the approaching storm clouds outside the window.  The Boeing 737-800, "The Wandering Wind," was a familiar beast, a metal bird carrying her, and thousands of other passengers, across the endless expanse of the Atlantic.  Tonight, however, the wind felt particularly sharp, a premonition of turbulence not just in the air, but in her own life.

Amelia, a flight attendant with Air Zenith for the past five years, meticulously checked her assigned passengers' seat maps, her eyes tracing the names and booking codes.  This flight was more packed than usual, a last-minute surge of travellers caught in the late-summer rush, making the already cramped cabin feel even tighter.  The rhythmic clatter of trays being stacked, the muffled sobs of a crying child, the low murmur of conversations in various languages, all blended into a cacophony that usually lulled her into a serene autopilot.  But tonight, the cacophony was a battlefield, and she found herself struggling to keep her composure.  The flight was due to depart from London Gatwick in just under two hours.
