The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the cobblestones of  Old Market Square, illuminating the chipped paint of the baker's stall and the flour-dusted apron of Amelia "Poppy" Butterfield.  A biting November wind howled, whipping rain-slicked leaves into a frenzy around the small, unassuming shop.  Inside, the air hung thick with the sweet, yeasty aroma of freshly baked bread â€“ a comforting balm against the chill outside. Poppy, her face flushed with exertion and the warmth of the roaring oven, meticulously arranged a tray of warm, crusty baguettes. Tonight, the aroma was particularly potent, an almost intoxicating blend of cinnamon, nutmeg, and the faintest hint of honey.  The square, usually bustling with merchants and patrons, was eerily quiet tonight, save for the mournful cries of gulls circling above the darkened rooftops.  This was not the bustling Wednesday market Poppy anticipated.  This night held a different kind of magic, a palpable sense of something unseen stirring just below the surface of the ordinary.
