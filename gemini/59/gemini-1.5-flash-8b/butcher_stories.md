The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the butcher shop, highlighting the glistening, crimson hues of the freshly-carved haunches of venison hanging from the rafters.  A chill, sharper than the winter air outside, snaked through the narrow, timber-lined space, clinging to the damp walls and the apron of Bartholomew "Barty" Blackwood, 27, as he meticulously trimmed a lamb's shoulder.  The scent of brine, herbs, and something akin to old leather hung heavy in the air, a symphony of smells both comforting and faintly unsettling.  Barty, his face pale beneath the flickering light, concentrated, his thick calloused fingers deftly working the steel.  He wasn't just a butcher; he was a craftsman, an artist of the kill, sculpting the very essence of life into edible form.  His shop, "Blackwood's Cleaver," was tucked away on a cobbled side street in the bustling, yet strangely quiet, port city of Aethelgard.  The city, a tapestry woven from shimmering towers and narrow alleyways, was known for its bustling docks, its lavish merchant houses, and its pervasive air of hidden secrets.  Barty, however, only knew the secrets whispered in the clanging of the butcher's cleaver against bone and the soft bleating of the animals that passed through his hands. This night, however, a new, unsettling secret was about to be revealed, one that would forever change his life.
