The biting wind, a relentless harbinger of the approaching winter, whipped at Captain Amelia "Amy"  Stark's face as she watched the orange glow of the inferno consume the old Victorian on Elm Street.  The air, thick with the acrid smell of burning wood and plastic, stung her lungs, but she pushed it down, focusing on the frantic calls crackling over her radio.  Above the cacophony, the rhythmic thud of her boots on the cobblestones echoed, a counterpoint to the relentless roar of the flames.

Built on the foundation of generations past, Oakhaven held a special place in her heart, a place where the ghosts of forgotten stories seemed to linger in the shadows of the meticulously maintained, yet often forgotten, structures. This particular house, "The Blackwood Manor," was known for its intricate carved wooden details and whispered tales of a previous owner said to have had a penchant for collecting rare artifacts. Now, shrouded in a fiery embrace, those whispers seemed less like folklore and more like ominous pronouncements. The flickering light played across the ornate facade, painting dancing shadows that mocked the urgency of the situation.  Amy knew, with a chilling certainty, that this fire wouldn't be easily contained.
