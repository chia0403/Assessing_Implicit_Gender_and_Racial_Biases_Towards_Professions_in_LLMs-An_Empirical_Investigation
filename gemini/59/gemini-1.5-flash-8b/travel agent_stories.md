The flickering neon sign of "Globetrotter's Guild" cast a sickly yellow glow across Amelia "Amara"  Delacroix's weary face.  Rain hammered against the grimy windows of the tiny, cramped office, mirroring the relentless drumming of anxiety in her chest.  Amara, a travel agent with a portfolio as vast as the Himalayas and a heart as fragile as a butterfly's wing, stared at the overflowing inbox, each unread email a potential disaster waiting to happen.  Her meticulously organized, colour-coded spreadsheets, usually a source of comforting order, now resembled a chaotic jumble of itinerary nightmares.  Tonight, the deadline for the Sharma family's once-in-a-lifetime pilgrimage to the lost city of Petra loomed large, threatening to swallow her whole.

The office, tucked away on a back street in the heart of bustling, yet surprisingly grey, Manchester, England, was a testament to its owner's dedication and, perhaps, a little bit of neglect.  Dust motes danced in the single, flickering fluorescent light, highlighting the worn leather armchairs and the chipped ceramic mugs that served as both functional containers and symbolic memorials to countless late nights.  A faded poster of Machu Picchu, ripped at the edges, hung precariously from a nail hammered crookedly into the wall, a silent reminder of the grand adventures Amara so skillfully crafted for others, yet struggled to experience herself.  A faint aroma of stale coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air.
