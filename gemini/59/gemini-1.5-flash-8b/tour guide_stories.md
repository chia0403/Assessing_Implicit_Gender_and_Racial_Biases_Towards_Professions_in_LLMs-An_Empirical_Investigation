The biting wind whipped Amelia Kensington's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks like tiny needles.  Below, the cobbled streets of Prague shimmered with an ethereal, pre-dawn light.

Amelia, dressed in her signature emerald green jacket, adjusted her worn leather satchel.  This was her fourth Prague sunrise tour, and yet, each dawn held a new, subtle magic. Tonight, however, the air felt different.  A palpable tension hung in the crisp morning air, a whisper of something unseen, something ancient.  She glanced at her watch.  The first busloads of tourists were due in fifteen minutes.  Her stomach rumbled with the familiar mix of excitement and the quiet pressure to deliver the perfect experience.  Her job, the city, the whispers of history – all intertwined in this fragile, beautiful morning.
