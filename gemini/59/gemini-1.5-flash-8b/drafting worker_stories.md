The fluorescent lights of the drafting room hummed, a monotonous counterpoint to the rhythmic click-clack of Amelia Blackwood's drafting pen against the crisp, white paper.  Dust motes danced in the meager shafts of light filtering through the grimy windowpanes, illuminating the intricate patterns etched onto her blueprint.  The air, thick with the scent of stale coffee and the ever-present metallic tang of machine oil, clung to her like a second skin.  Amelia, a drafting worker at the sprawling, century-old engineering firm of Sterling & Sons, was lost in the detailed rendering of a complex hydraulic valve system.  Her precise, almost obsessive, attention to detail was her solace, her refuge from the relentless drone of the assembly line that pulsed outside the drafting room. The room, a stark rectangular space, was crammed with metal filing cabinets, overflowing with decades' worth of blueprints.  Sunlight barely touched the space, and the air conditioner struggled to keep pace with the heat radiating from the nearby machinery.  A worn, leather-bound notebook lay open beside her, filled with sketches and calculations meticulously scribbled in a spidery hand, a record of countless hours spent poring over intricate diagrams.
