The fluorescent hum of the waiting room, a monotonous drone punctuated by the rhythmic *tap-tap-tap* of Amelia Hayes's fingers on the polished stainless steel of her pen, seemed to vibrate right through her.  Amelia Hayes, dental hygienist extraordinaire (or at least, that's what she told herself), meticulously filed her nails, the crimson polish a stark contrast to the pale, sterile walls of Dr. Chen's office.  The scent of antiseptic clung to the air, a familiar perfume that, despite its antiseptic quality, seemed to linger with the peculiar sweetness of over-ripe oranges. Today, however, the aroma held a particular sharpness, hinting at something moreâ€¦ unsettling.

Amelia's office, a small, compact space tucked behind the reception area, was a study in functional efficiency.  Rows of gleaming dental tools, each one gleaming with the promise of a perfect smile, lined the walls. A large window, framed by antiseptic-smelling vinyl, offered a glimpse of the bustling city street outside.  A constant stream of taxis, a symphony of horns, and the distant rumble of the subway were a stark reminder of the world that existed just beyond these sterile confines. Amelia, despite her best efforts to block it out, felt a prickle of anxiety. Today, a client's pain had lingered beyond a simple toothache.
