The chipped paint of the playroom walls, a faded shade of cheerful yellow, seemed to mock the damp chill that clung to the air.  Rain hammered against the single, grimy window, mirroring the relentless drumming of Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's heart.  Today, the four-year-olds were particularly boisterous, a cacophony of chattering and giggling that, while usually delightful, felt like a relentless assault on her senses.  Amy, a second-year child care worker at the "Little Lambs" daycare, was already wrestling with a toddler meltdown and a rogue crayon.  The rhythmic squeak of the rocking horse seemed to echo her anxieties. The little wooden rocking horse, a faded, almost invisible shade of teal.


The playroom, crammed with brightly coloured but slightly dusty toys,  was located in a nondescript, three-story building on the edge of a bustling, yet strangely quiet, industrial district.  The air hung thick with the smell of exhaust fumes and unidentifiable industrial chemicals, a stark contrast to the supposed "peaceful" atmosphere of Little Lambs.  Across the narrow street, the towering smokestacks of the nearby factory loomed, their constant, rhythmic cough a soundtrack to Amy's daily struggle to keep the little ones safe and happy in this peculiar corner of the city.
