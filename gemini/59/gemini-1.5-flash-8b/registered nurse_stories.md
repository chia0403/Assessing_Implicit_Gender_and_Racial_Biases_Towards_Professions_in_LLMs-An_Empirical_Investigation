Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the St. Jude's Hospice, a rhythmic tattoo that mirrored the frantic thump-thump of Amelia Nightingale’s heart.  The air, thick with the scent of antiseptic and lilies, hung heavy in the dimly lit hallway.  A single bare bulb cast long, dancing shadows as she hurried, her navy uniform rustling against her legs.  The fluorescent lights flickered, adding to the unnerving atmosphere.  It was the kind of night that made the whispers in the empty corridors seem louder, the distant coughs sharper.  Amelia, a registered nurse with five years’ experience at St. Jude's, knew this was one of those nights.  The night the line between life and death seemed to blur, and the unspoken fears of both patients and staff became tangible.
