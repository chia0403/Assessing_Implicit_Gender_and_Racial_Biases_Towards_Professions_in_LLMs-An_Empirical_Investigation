The biting wind whipped across the cobblestones of Covent Garden, stinging Elara Vance-Ashworth's cheeks as she hurried towards the dilapidated theatre, The Globe's Shadow.  Dust motes danced in the pale light filtering through the grimy windows, mirroring the swirling chaos in her mind.  The upcoming production of Shakespeare's "The Tempest" was, to put it mildly, a disaster in the making.  The cast was a motley crew, the set design was a ludicrous mess, and the funding was barely enough to cover a single performance, let alone the extravagant costumes she had envisioned.

Elara, a theatrical director of undeniable passion and equally undeniable flair, often found herself wrestling with the very essence of theatre, a battle fought as much in the dusty rehearsal room as in the opulent salons of London's high society.  This particular season of The Globe's Shadow, however, felt different.  The building itself seemed to breathe with a history older than the plays it housed, whispering tales of forgotten actors and triumphant premieres. Every creak of the wooden floorboards, every rustle of the decaying velvet curtain, resonated with a palpable sense of foreboding.  Tonight, however, was the night of the first run-through, a moment both exhilarating and terrifying.  Could she coax these disparate elements into a harmonious whole, or would "The Tempest" be lost in the shadows of The Globe's Shadow itself?
