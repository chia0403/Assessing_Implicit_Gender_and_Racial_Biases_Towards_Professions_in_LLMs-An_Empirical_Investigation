The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual, dull grey from years of lukewarm water and forgotten soapsuds, reflected the single, flickering bulb hanging precariously from the ceiling above.  Dust motes danced in the feeble light, swirling like tiny, spectral insects in a forgotten room.  This was the kitchen, the heart – or rather, the decaying husk of a heart – of the Blackwood Manor, and this was where Elara Blackwood, housekeeper, began her day.  Her full name, Elara Evangeline Blackwood, a name both a blessing and a curse, echoed in the cavernous silence. Not the resounding echo of grandeur, but a hollow, whispering one that seemed to hold the weight of generations past.

The setting was stark.  Blackwood Manor, a sprawling, gothic edifice draped in ivy and clinging to the side of a windswept hill, was a monument to a forgotten opulence.  Rain hammered against the leaded windows, a relentless percussion against the decaying grandeur.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of mildew and aged wood, a symphony of decay that seemed to permeate every corner of the house.  Sunlight, when it dared to peek through the swirling clouds, illuminated dust motes dancing in the air like forgotten dreams. The house felt lived in, yet deserted. Each room held the echoes of laughter and tears, whispers of lost loves and whispered secrets. Elara, though bound to the manor, felt utterly alone in its vastness, her only companion the creaking of floorboards and the rustle of unseen drafts.
