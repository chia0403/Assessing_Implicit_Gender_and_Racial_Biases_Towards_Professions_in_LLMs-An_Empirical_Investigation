The fluorescent lights of the "Apothecary's Corner" hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic click-clack of Amelia Nightingale's fingers as she meticulously measured out a precise dose of atropine sulfate.  The air, thick with the scent of lavender disinfectant and decaying roses (a peculiar, if not endearing, choice of decoration), hung heavy in the small, cluttered shop.  Dust motes danced in the meager beams of sunlight filtering through the grimy windowpanes, illuminating a scattering of vintage apothecary jars, each one a silent testament to bygone eras.  Amelia, a young pharmacist with eyes the colour of a stormy sea, frowned slightly, adjusting her glasses.  The prescription called for an unusually high dosage, a fact that troubled her more than the usual daily grind.  She traced the intricate script of the physician, Dr. Alistair Finch, a man she'd come to know as well as she knew the names of the herbs and potions shelved in the back room.  Something about this prescription felt...off.
