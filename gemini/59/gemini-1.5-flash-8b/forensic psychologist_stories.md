The flickering fluorescent lights of the coroner's office hummed a monotonous dirge, a counterpoint to the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Dr. Eleanor Vance’s heart.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom, illuminating the stark white table where a young woman lay, her lifeless eyes staring blankly at the ceiling.  A single, crimson rose, wilting, rested on her chest.

Eleanor Vance, forensic psychologist, felt the familiar chill creep up her spine.  This wasn't just another case.  The meticulous arrangement of the scene, the stark simplicity of the victim's posture, screamed of a calculated, precise mind at work.  Her initial assessment was confirmed by the meticulous, almost artistic, nature of the wound, the precise positioning of the rose.  It wasn't murder, not in the conventional sense.  This was something… else.

The setting was the cramped, windowless coroner's office in the bustling, yet oddly quiet, city of Alderwood, nestled amidst the industrial sprawl of the Pacific Coast.  The air, heavy with the metallic tang of disinfectant and the lingering scent of decay, pressed against her, mirroring the suffocating pressure building in her chest.  The walls were lined with neatly organized files, each a silent chronicle of lives lost, lives dissected, lives… interpreted.  This was her domain, her battlefield, and the silence felt as oppressive as the impending mystery.

This particular case, file number 237-45-Alpha, was her newest challenge, and she knew, with a certainty that settled deep within her bones, that it held a key to unlocking a puzzle far more complex than any she had encountered before.
