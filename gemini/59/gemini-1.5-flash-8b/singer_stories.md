The chipped paint of the "Velvet Moon" cabaret clung to the Parisian evening like a second skin, shimmering with the reflected light of the flickering gas lamps.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron awning, a relentless counterpoint to the seductive strains of violin music wafting from within.  Inside, amidst the smoky haze and the scent of cheap perfume and desperation,  Elodie de la Fleur, a singer with voice like liquid moonlight, adjusted the mic stand. Her crimson dress, almost blinding in the dim light, swirled around her slender frame.  Tonight, the clientele of the Velvet Moon were more discerning than usual.  A rumoured presence—a mysterious patron known only as "The Collector"—had promised a lavish sum for the perfect performance. Elodie, known for her unparalleled rendition of melancholic ballads and passionate love songs, felt a tremor of nervous excitement course through her. Tonight, everything depended on the notes she sang.
