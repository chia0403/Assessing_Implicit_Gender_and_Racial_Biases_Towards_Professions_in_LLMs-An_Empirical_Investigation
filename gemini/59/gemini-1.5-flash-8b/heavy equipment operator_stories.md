The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of the Badlands, stinging Amelia Stone's cheeks and rattling the metal cab of the CAT 385.  Dust, the colour of burnt umber, swirled around her like a phantom army, obscuring the already-scarred landscape.  Dawn, a pale, bruised lavender, was just beginning to paint the horizon, casting long, skeletal shadows that stretched across the parched earth.  Amelia, her name a stark counterpoint to the muted tones of the surrounding wilderness, gripped the wheel, the rhythmic thump of the engine a steady heartbeat in the otherwise silent expanse.  Her weathered hands, calloused and strong, found a familiar comfort in the coarse texture of the controls.  This was her kingdom, this vast, unforgiving expanse of rock and scrub, and for the moment, she was its sole mistress.  The air, thin and dry, held the faint smell of diesel and the faint, acrid tang of burnt earth, a constant companion on this desolate patrol. Today's mission: locating a collapsed mine shaft, a potentially perilous task in a region where the very ground seemed to hold its breath.
