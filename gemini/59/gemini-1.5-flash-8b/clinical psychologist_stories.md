The flickering fluorescent lights of the waiting room cast long, skeletal shadows across the beige vinyl chairs.  Dr. Eleanor Vance, a clinical psychologist with eyes the color of storm clouds and a perpetually tired smile, adjusted the worn leather strap of her bag.  Rain hammered against the single, grimy window, mirroring the tempest brewing within her.  The rhythmic drumming seemed to echo the anxious breath of the teenager slumped in the corner booth, her head buried in her hands.  This was a familiar symphony in Eleanor's practice, a symphony of teenage angst and unspoken fears played out against the backdrop of a city perpetually shrouded in grey.

**Setting:**

The waiting room, a sterile, almost claustrophobic space in a run-down building in the heart of the burgeoning, but impoverished,  industrial district of Kingston.  Broken tiles marred the floor, and chipped paint peeled from the walls, hinting at a history of neglect.  A faint, sickly sweet smell of cheap coffee and something vaguely medicinal hung in the air. The city itself, choked by pollution from the nearby factories, mirrored the internal turmoil Eleanor saw reflected in her patients. The relentless drizzle that coated everything in a thin film of grime wasn't just outside; it seemed to seep into the very essence of the place, contributing to the palpable sense of unease.
