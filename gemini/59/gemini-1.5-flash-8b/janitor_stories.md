The fluorescent hum of the Grand Archivist's Library sliced through the oppressive silence of the late-night shift.  Dust motes, illuminated by the sickly yellow glow, danced in the air like miniature, spectral dancers.  Amelia Blackwood, a woman whose practical, charcoal-grey uniform seemed to absorb rather than reflect the light, moved with the deliberate grace of a seasoned dancer navigating a minefield.  Her worn, leather-bound journal, tucked under her arm, felt strangely heavy. This was the third night in a row she’d felt this peculiar weight, this prickle of unease amidst the usual, comforting hum of the building.

The Grand Archivist's Library was a behemoth of stone and glass, a sprawling labyrinth of towering bookshelves that stretched into the inky blackness beyond the pale light of the city.  Ancient, leather-bound volumes, their pages filled with faded ink and whispers of forgotten histories, lined the walls.  Dust, the library’s constant companion, swirled in the corners, and the faint scent of aged paper and something indefinably…metallic, hung in the air.  Amelia knew every nook and cranny of the building, every creak of the ancient wooden floorboards, every shadowed corner where forgotten stories lay hidden.  Tonight, however, the silence was thicker, the shadows deeper.  She was certain something was different.
