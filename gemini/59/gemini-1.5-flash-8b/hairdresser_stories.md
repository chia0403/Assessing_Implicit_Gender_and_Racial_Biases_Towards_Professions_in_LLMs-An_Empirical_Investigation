The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual, milky beige from years of lukewarm water and forgotten hairspray, reflected the flickering fluorescent light above Amelia Nightingale's head.  Dust motes danced in the lone beam, painting swirling patterns on the walls of her tiny salon, "Scissors & Smiles," a space squeezed between a bakery and a struggling bookstore.  The aroma of stale coffee, cinnamon rolls, and something faintly floral clung to the air, a comforting yet peculiar blend.  Outside, the grey London sky wept a steady drizzle, mirroring the gloom settling over Amelia's mood.  Her phone buzzed, a jarring interruption to the quiet hum of the salon.  It was another cancellation, another empty chair, another day closer to the precipice of closing the doors for good.
