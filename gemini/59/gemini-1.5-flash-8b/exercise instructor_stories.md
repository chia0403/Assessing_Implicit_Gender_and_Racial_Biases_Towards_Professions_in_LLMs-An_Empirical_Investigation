The humid air hung thick and heavy, a suffocating blanket draped over the bustling city.  Sunlight, fractured by the towering skyscrapers, cast long, distorted shadows across the pavement.  It was the kind of day that made sweat bead on your skin, even if you weren't moving.  This was precisely the kind of day that Amelia Rose Hawthorne, personal trainer extraordinaire, thrived on.  

Amelia, a woman sculpted from sun-drenched determination and a whirlwind of vibrant energy, surveyed the scene from her perch atop the makeshift platform in the city park.  Below, a smattering of park-goers – the elderly, the weary, the wildly enthusiastic – were beginning their workout.  The rhythmic thump of the DJ's beats echoed through the trees, punctuated by the occasional grunt, hiss, and strained sigh of effort.  Amelia adjusted the microphone clipped to her sweat-soaked tank top, the vibrant pink a stark contrast to the muted tones of the late afternoon.  Today's class, "Urban Oasis," was focused on high-intensity interval training designed to melt away the city's stresses.
