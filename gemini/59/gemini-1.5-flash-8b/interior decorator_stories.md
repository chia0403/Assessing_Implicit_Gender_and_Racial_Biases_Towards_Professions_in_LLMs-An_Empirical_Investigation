The chipped paint of the Victorian banister scraped against Amelia Blackwood's impeccably polished leather boot.  Dust motes, disturbed by the gentle jostle, danced in the afternoon sun filtering through the stained-glass window depicting a scene of mythical beasts.  Amelia, Interior Designer extraordinaire, surveyed the crumbling grandeur with a practiced eye, a meticulous frown etching itself onto her forehead.  This wasn't just a house; it was a forgotten masterpiece, a canvas yearning for a fresh coat of life.  The air, thick with the scent of aged wood and lingering decay, mingled with the faint, almost imperceptible, aroma of lavender, a lingering echo of a bygone era.  This was the Blackwood Manor, a sprawling estate overlooking the rolling emerald hills of the Cotswolds, and Amelia, heir to its neglected past, was tasked with restoring it, one meticulously chosen shade of emerald green at a time.
