The flickering fluorescent lights of the emergency room hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the frantic rush of the night.  Dr. Amelia "Amy"  Rivera, physician's assistant, adjusted her glasses, the thin plastic lenses reflecting the anxious faces crowding the waiting area.  Outside, the city roared, a symphony of sirens and distant car horns, but inside the sterile white walls, a different kind of pressure simmered.  The air hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and fear.

The setting was the bustling, perpetually overcrowded emergency department of the San Mateo General Hospital.  Rows of identical examination rooms, each a small, clinical island of activity, faced the long waiting room, where families huddled, clutching hands, their faces etched with worry.  The air conditioning, though struggling to keep up, circulated a constant, faintly metallic smell.  A rhythmic beeping echoed off the sterile walls, a metronome marking the relentless march of time, time that seemed to slow to a crawl when someone's life was at stake.  The soft glow of the computer screens cast a pale light on Amy's face, highlighting the dark circles under her eyes, a testament to countless late nights and stressful situations.
