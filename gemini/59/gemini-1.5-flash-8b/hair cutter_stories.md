The chipped paint of the "Scissors & Smiles" salon reflected the afternoon sun, catching the dust motes dancing in the air like tiny, ethereal butterflies.  Elias Thorne, a man whose fingers seemed to possess a silent poetry with which they coaxed life into hair, sat hunched over a client's head.  The rhythmic snip-snip-snip of his shears echoed in the otherwise hushed space, a metronome keeping time with the steady sigh of the air conditioner.  The scent of lavender and something vaguely citrusy, perhaps orange blossom, hung heavy in the air, a subtle perfume that always seemed to comfort Elias. Today, though, the aroma did little to mask the knot tightening in his stomach.  Outside, the vibrant cacophony of the bustling city street, usually a soothing counterpoint to the salon's quietude, seemed particularly jarring. He felt a sudden, sharp premonition, a cold fingertip against his heart, foreboding the arrival of something he couldn't quite place.
