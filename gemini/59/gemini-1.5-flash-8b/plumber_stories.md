The flickering neon sign of "Ace Plumbing" cast a sickly yellow glow over the rain-slicked alleyway.  The air, thick with the smell of damp earth and something vaguely chemical, clung to Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield like a second skin. Barty, a plumber of unyielding optimism despite the grime coating his overalls and the perpetual dampness clinging to his soul, squinted at the flickering light.  Heâ€™d been at it for hours, tracing the source of the persistent drip, drip, drip echoing through the antiquated pipes of the dilapidated tenement building,  a symphony of despair to his meticulously-tuned inner ear.


The building itself was a testament to time's relentless assault.  Brickwork, once vibrant, was now a muted terracotta, crumbling in places, revealing glimpses of the dampness lurking within.  Grey moss, like unwelcome vegetation, clawed its way up the walls, clinging to the rusted iron railings.  A single, skeletal streetlamp, its bulb barely illuminating the gloom, cast long, dancing shadows that writhed around Barty's figure as he moved from one suspected leak to another.  The tenement, a sprawling, multi-story behemoth with doors that creaked open and shut like forgotten sighs, groaned and groaned with the relentless pressure of the city.  Dust motes, illuminated by the flickering neon, danced in the air, swirling around Barty like tiny, unseen phantoms. The cold seeped into his bones.
