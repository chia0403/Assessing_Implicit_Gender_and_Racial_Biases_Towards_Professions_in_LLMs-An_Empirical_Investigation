The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine and something vaguely metallic, perhaps the old copper pipes groaning beneath the sprawling Victorian mansion.  Rain hammered against the leaded-glass windows of "Serenity's Embrace," a massage therapy practice tucked away on a cobbled side street of Blackwood, a town steeped in ancient history and shadowed by a looming, perpetually overcast sky.
