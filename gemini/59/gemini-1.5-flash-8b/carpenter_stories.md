The biting November wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's apron around her legs, stinging her cheeks with icy rain.  The skeletal branches of the ancient oaks, their gnarled fingers clawing at the bruised sky, mirrored the knot of frustration tightening in her chest.  She hunched deeper into the small, cluttered workshop, the flickering candlelight painting dancing shadows on the rough-hewn workbench.  Tools, like miniature, hardened warriors, lay scattered amongst sawdust and shavings, each a testament to a thousand projects, both successful and utterly ruined.  Amelia Blackwood, carpenter extraordinaire (or so she told herself), stared at the stubbornly stubborn piece of oak, its grain a complex, defiant puzzle.  This particular commission, a custom-carved birdhouse for the reclusive Miss Evangeline Finch, was proving more frustrating than any beast of burden she'd ever encountered.  The workshop, tucked away at the edge of the whispering woods behind the market square, reeked of pine, linseed oil, and a subtle, earthy aroma that spoke of the encroaching winter.  Sunlight, barely a trickle, struggled to penetrate the gaps between the rough-hewn timber walls, creating a mood as moody as Miss Finch herself.  The air hung thick with the scent of damp earth and the distant murmur of the town, a symphony of creaking carts and the rumble of hooves.  Amelia sighed, a sound swallowed by the wind's lament. This birdhouse, more than a commission, was a test, a challenge to her very spirit.
