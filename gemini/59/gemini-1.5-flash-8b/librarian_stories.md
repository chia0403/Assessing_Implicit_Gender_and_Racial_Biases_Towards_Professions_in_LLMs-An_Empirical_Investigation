The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Forgotten Pages" library cast long, skeletal shadows across Amelia Blackwood’s meticulously organized shelves.  Dust motes, tiny specks of forgotten stories, danced in the pale beams.  Amelia, a librarian with eyes the colour of aged parchment and hair like spun moonlight, felt a tremor run through the building, a faint, almost imperceptible shudder that seemed to emanate from the very heart of the vast, cavernous space.  It wasn't an earthquake, she was sure of it. It was something… else.  The old, creaky wooden floorboards beneath her feet seemed to sigh in response.

The library, a sprawling Victorian mansion tucked away on a secluded, fog-shrouded corner of Oakhaven, was a labyrinth of hushed whispers and forgotten tales.  Books, overflowing from every shelf, whispered their secrets in a low, murmuring chorus.  Dusty, leather-bound volumes lined the walls, their aged spines hinting at eras long past.  Cobwebs hung like forgotten lace, draped over dusty antique furniture and antique globes, their glass interiors reflecting the ever-present gloom.  A faint, sweet scent of aged paper and something indefinably… floral, clung to the air, a perfume of history.  Amelia, whose life had been entirely bound to the quiet solitude of the library, felt strangely unsettled.  Tonight, the whispers felt louder.
