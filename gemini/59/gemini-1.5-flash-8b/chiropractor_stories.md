The fluorescent hum of the clinic, a constant, low thrum that vibrated through Amelia Blackwood's bones, was the soundtrack to her life.  Dr. Amelia Blackwood, DC, adjusted spines and released tensions, hoping to alleviate the aches and pains that plagued her patients as much as they plagued her own sometimes.  Her small, almost clinical, office in the quiet corner of Oakhaven, a suburb nestled between the whispering pines and the relentless rush of the interstate, felt like a microcosm of the world outside.  Each click and pop, each sigh of relief, was a tiny victory in a world that often felt like a relentless struggle against gravity, against stress, against the very fabric of time itself.  Today, however, the hum of the fluorescent lights seemed to amplify the silence.  It was an unusually quiet Tuesday, the kind that felt heavy, pregnant with unspoken anxieties.
