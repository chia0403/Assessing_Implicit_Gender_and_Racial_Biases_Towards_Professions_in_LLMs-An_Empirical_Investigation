The chipped porcelain sink, stained a dull apricot from years of spilled polish and forgotten dreams, reflected Amelia Peabody's face.  Her reflection, usually a vibrant mosaic of freckles and laughter lines, was clouded with a film of anxiety.  She ran a shaky hand through the short, tightly wound curls that had stubbornly refused to return to their usual cascade of auburn waves.  The rhythmic click-clack of manicured nails on the polished wooden table, a familiar lullaby in her tiny, sun-drenched salon, felt jarringly loud today.  Amelia needed a distraction.  A good distraction.

The salon, "Calla Lily's Elegance," was nestled on a quiet side street in the heart of a bustling, historic district.  Sunlight, filtered through the dusty-rose curtains, painted the walls in a soft, ethereal glow.  The air, thick with the scent of lilies and the faint tang of lemon-scented polish remover, hung heavy with unspoken stories.  Amelia knew, with a certainty that unsettled her, that whatever she was about to face would unfold within these very walls, within the silent observation of the vintage posters depicting idealized beauty, and the whispered murmur of gossip carried on the breeze from neighboring apartments.  A single, vibrant red rose, a gift from a client whoâ€™d been a fixture in her chair for years, sat proudly in a chipped ceramic vase on the counter, a stark contrast to the tension tightening in Amelia's chest.  Today, she had a new client.  One with a secret.
