The fluorescent hum of the office vibrated through Amelia Hayesâ€™s worn-out sneakers, a counterpoint to the frantic tapping of her keyboard.  Paperclips scattered like fallen leaves on the already cluttered desk, a testament to the relentless tide of tax returns that flowed through "Tax Time Solutions."  The air, thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, hung heavy in the small, windowless office, a suffocating embrace in the heart of the bustling city.  Amelia, a woman of thirty-two with a perpetually tired smile and eyes that held the weight of countless deductions and exemptions, stared blankly at the screen.  Another return, another story of strained budgets and uncertain futures, waiting to be painstakingly deciphered.  Today, however, there was something different.  Today, the return belonged to a Mr. Caspian Blackwood, and a note about an unusual sum of income from "Blackwood Industries" caught her attention.  The setting: a small, cramped tax preparation office on a busy side street in a concrete jungle of New York City.  The year was 2024.
