The clatter of clippers, a rhythmic tattoo against the chipped Formica counter, was Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's lullaby.  He hadn't consciously chosen it, but the relentless whirring of the machine, the insistent snip-snip-snip, had become the soundtrack of his life.  Barty Butterfield, proprietor of "The Trimmed Turret," a tiny barber shop tucked away on a cobbled side street in the heart of the crumbling, yet strangely vibrant, city of Aethelgard.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the grime-coated window, illuminating the faded posters of bygone athletic heroes and the faded, but still defiant, slogan: "Aethelgard's Finest Trimmed."  The scent of lavender-infused shaving cream and stale coffee hung heavy in the air, punctuated by the occasional whiff of burnt toast drifting in from the nearby bakery.  A single, flickering fluorescent light cast long, dancing shadows on the dusty mirror, reflecting a kaleidoscope of faces â€“ from the weary faces of the miners who toiled in the nearby hills to the polished, meticulously coiffed heads of the city's elite.  Today, however, the only face staring back at Barty was a haunted one, etched with worry lines and filled with an unspoken sorrow.
