The flickering neon sign of the "Rusty Reel" cast a sickly yellow glow over the rain-slicked streets of Newhaven.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the dilapidated cinema, a constant, insistent drumming that mirrored the frantic rhythm in Amelia "Maisie" Carmichael's head.  Maisie Carmichael, a 37-year-old independent film director with eyes the colour of storm clouds and a perpetually smudged lipstick, paced the cramped, cluttered editing room.  Empty takeout containers, crumpled script pages, and discarded coffee cups littered the space like fallen leaves in a November wind.  Newhaven, a city of forgotten dreams and echoing alleys, held a particular charm, or perhaps a cruel irony, for Maisie.  It was here, in this city on the precipice of decay, that she had crafted her cinematic masterpieces and, now, felt her latest project threatening to dissolve into a quagmire of self-doubt and creative paralysis.
