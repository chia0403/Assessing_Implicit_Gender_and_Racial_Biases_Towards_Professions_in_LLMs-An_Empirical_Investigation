The biting wind, a relentless, icy claw, whipped across the desolate expanse of the I-95 median.  Dust, kicked up by the passing semi-trucks, swirled into miniature tornadoes, dancing around Amelia "Ames" Rodriguez's worn-out boots.  The grey concrete, fractured and scarred from countless freeze-thaw cycles, reflected the pale November sun like a broken mirror.  This stretch of highway, a concrete ribbon snaking through the heart of the desolate Appalachian foothills, was Ames's domain for the week.  Her work crew, a motley collection of seasoned veterans and recent hires, hunkered down in the cramped, metal shack they called their command center, a testament to the harsh realities of their trade.  The air hung thick with the smell of diesel fumes and something akin to despair, a familiar scent that clung to this forgotten corner of the world.  Ames, her face etched with the lines of countless sleepless nights and the weight of responsibility, surveyed the scene from behind the battered, reinforced windshield of her truck. The fluorescent lights of the shack flickered, casting an eerie glow on the chipped posters of antique cars and the faded, slightly-blurred photographs of smiling families.  Her task: to patch the latest fissure, a gaping maw of cracked asphalt that threatened to swallow a semi-truck whole. This was no easy fix.  This was Ames's life.
