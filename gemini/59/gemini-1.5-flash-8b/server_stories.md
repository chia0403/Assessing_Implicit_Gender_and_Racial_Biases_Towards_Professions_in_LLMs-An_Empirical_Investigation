The flickering neon sign of the Rusty Mug cast a sickly yellow glow over Amelia "Ash" Ashworth, illuminating the dust motes dancing in the humid air.  The aroma of stale coffee, burnt popcorn, and desperation hung heavy in the air, a familiar scent in the backroom of the establishment.  The Rusty Mug, a dive bar tucked between a pawn shop and a laundromat, wasn't known for its ambiance.  In fact, "ambiance" wasn't a word in its vocabulary.  But it was Ash's job, and tonight, it was a surprisingly quiet night.  Too quiet, perhaps.  Usually, the regulars were a boisterous bunch, their laughter and complaints a constant soundtrack to Ash's shifts.  This evening, however, only the clinking of mugs and the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Ashâ€™s pen against a worn notepad broke the silence.

The setting was a dimly lit backroom, a stark contrast to the smoky front of the bar.  Rough-hewn tables, stained with spilled beer and forgotten hopes, lined the space.  A chipped porcelain sink, the remnants of a once-grand bathroom, stood near the back wall, its faucet dripping a lonely, melancholic tune.  Behind the counter, a haphazard collection of mismatched mugs, chipped teapots, and a perpetually overflowing ashtray sat, mocking the attempt at tidiness.  Dust clung to everything.  The air itself seemed to hold a faint, metallic tang, possibly from the old pipes snaking through the walls, or maybe just the accumulation of the bar's many unspoken stories.
