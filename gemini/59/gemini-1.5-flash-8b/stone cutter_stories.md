The chill wind, biting sharper than any chisel, whipped across the jagged peaks of the Cinder Mountains, stinging Elias Thorne's cheeks.  He hunched deeper into his worn leather jerkin, the rough-hewn stone of the quarry pressing against his back.  Dust, the colour of burnt umber, coated everything – his clothes, his tools, the air itself.  For Elias Thorne, a stone cutter of the Frostfang Quarry, this was a normal Tuesday.  The mountain itself seemed to breathe, groaning with the slow, rhythmic crackle of geological forces; a symphony of muted thunder, only half-heard amidst the howl of the wind.

The quarry, a vast scar etched into the heart of the Cinder Mountains, stretched as far as Elias could see.  Giant slabs of obsidian and amethyst-veined granite, fractured by time and fire, lay scattered like forgotten dreams.  Each block held a story, whispering tales of ancient volcanoes and forgotten civilizations.  Elias’s small team of cutters, a ragtag bunch bound by the unforgiving landscape and their shared toil, were the only witnesses to these silent narratives.  Their tools – hammers, chisels, and mallets – echoed across the cavernous space, a percussive counterpoint to the wind’s lament. This week, a particularly large, polished black stone – rumored to be the heart of some long-lost titan – had been unearthed, demanding a precise hand and unyielding determination.
