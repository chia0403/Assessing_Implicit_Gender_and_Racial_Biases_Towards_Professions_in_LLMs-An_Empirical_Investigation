The fluorescent lights of the "Everything Under the Sun" department store hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia Josephine Finch’s life.  Dust motes danced in the artificial sunlight filtering through the grimy plastic panels of the ceiling, mirroring the swirling anxieties in Amelia’s stomach.  Today, the usual cacophony of shoppers – the clatter of carts, the sharp intakes of breath, the hushed murmurs of comparing prices – was amplified by a low, almost palpable tension.  It wasn’t the kind of tension that resulted from a particularly aggressive customer or a sudden rush; it was a simmering unease, a premonition of something…off.

The store, a sprawling behemoth of bargain bins and dimly lit aisles, felt cavernous, even oppressive.  Stacks of overflowing cardboard boxes, overflowing with discounted kitchen appliances and mismatched furniture, lined the walls like a restless army.  The air smelled faintly of stale coffee, old cardboard, and something vaguely floral, a potent perfume that seemed to cling to the air like a shroud.  It wasn't pleasant, and it didn't feel right.   Amelia stood behind register 17, the worn plastic countertop reflecting the anxious lines etched around her eyes.  The digital clock on the register blinked relentlessly, each second a tick closer to disaster.
