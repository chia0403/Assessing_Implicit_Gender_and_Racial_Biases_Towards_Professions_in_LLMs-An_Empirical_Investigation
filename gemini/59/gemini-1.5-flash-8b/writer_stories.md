The chipped Formica countertop gleamed under the single, flickering fluorescent light of the tiny kitchen.  Rain hammered against the windowpanes of Amelia Blackwood’s cramped apartment, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic rhythm of her thoughts.  Amelia, a writer of obscure poetry and achingly beautiful prose, stared at the lukewarm instant coffee swirling in her mug.  Across from her, perched precariously on a stack of rejection slips – each one a miniature monument to her literary failures – sat a battered laptop, blinking with a pathetically weak life.  The air, thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, felt heavier than the downpour outside.

**Setting:**

Amelia Blackwood’s apartment, a cramped, two-room space in a grey, pre-war building nestled in the shadow of a towering, imposing skyscraper in the heart of New York City's Lower East Side.  The neighbourhood pulsed with a vibrant, almost frenetic energy, a stark contrast to the quiet claustrophobia of her cramped apartment.  The rhythmic clang of metal on metal from a nearby construction site echoed the rhythmic hammering of rain.  Dust motes danced in the feeble light, highlighting the squalor and the quiet desperation of the urban landscape.  The city outside hummed with a restless energy that both invigorated and intimidated Amelia, mirroring the conflicting emotions warring within her.
