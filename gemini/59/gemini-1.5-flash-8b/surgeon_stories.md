The sterile white of the operating room hummed with a low, almost imperceptible thrum, a counterpoint to the rhythmic beep of the monitors.  Dr. Eleanor Vance, her brow furrowed in concentration, held a scalpel poised over a pulsating vein.  The air, thick with the scent of antiseptic and fear, felt almost tangible.  Her gloved hands, steady despite the tremor in her chest, guided the blade with practiced precision.  Outside, the city of Veridia, a sprawling metropolis choked by perpetual smog, pulsed with a cacophony of its own—the relentless honking of taxis, the shouts of hawkers, the distant rumble of industry.  Tonight, however, the only sound that mattered was the delicate *snip* of the scalpel against the patient’s skin.

Setting: The operating room of St. Jude's Hospital, Veridia, a sprawling, sprawling metropolis of towering, smog-choked skyscrapers that clawed at the perpetual overcast sky.  The hospital itself, while gleaming and modern on the surface, was a monument to the city's inequality—a beacon of hope for the wealthy, but often a cruel reminder of poverty to those whose only choice was the emergency room.
