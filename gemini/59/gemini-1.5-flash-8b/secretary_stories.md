Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the "Emerald Isle" pub, mimicking the frantic rhythm of Amelia Blackwood's heart.  The air, thick with the smell of stale beer and damp earth, clung to her like a second skin.  Amelia, a meticulously organized secretary with a penchant for perfectly sharpened pencils and perfectly brewed Earl Grey, found herself unexpectedly thrust into a world far removed from the pristine order of her office cubicle.

The setting:  A small, forgotten village nestled in the foothills of the Wicklow Mountains, Ireland.  Cobbled streets, slick with rain, wound their way past weathered cottages.  The pub, a faded emerald green, was the heart of the village, its interior dimly lit and filled with the low murmur of conversation.  A single, flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows that seemed to whisper secrets in the corners.  Tonight, those secrets were thick in the air, palpable even through the dampness.
