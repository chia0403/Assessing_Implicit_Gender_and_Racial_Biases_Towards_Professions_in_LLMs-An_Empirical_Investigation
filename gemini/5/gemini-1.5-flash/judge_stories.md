A single, struggling hibiscus plant in a chipped terracotta pot sat on her mahogany desk, a stubborn splash of vibrant colour against the muted tones of the room. Outside, the cacophony of the city – the rhythmic clang of a blacksmith's hammer, the hawkers' cries, the distant wail of a siren – pulsed like a relentless heartbeat, a stark contrast to the suffocating stillness within.
