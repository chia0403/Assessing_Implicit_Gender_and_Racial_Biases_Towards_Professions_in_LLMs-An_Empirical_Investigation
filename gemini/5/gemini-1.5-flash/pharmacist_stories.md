The chipped paint on the apothecary’s window sill flaked onto Elara Vance’s worn leather-bound journal, a fine dust mirroring the layer of grime clinging to the cobblestones of Oakhaven’s High Street.  A chill wind, scented with woodsmoke and brine from the nearby harbour, whipped around the ancient timber frame of “Vance Apothecary,” rattling the dusty bottles lining the shelves within.  Elara, her auburn braid escaping its confining bun to brush against her cheek, sighed, the breath misting in the pre-dawn air.

Something was wrong, terribly wrong, and the subtle shift in the air – a metallic tang that mingled with the salt – told her it had to do with the sea.
