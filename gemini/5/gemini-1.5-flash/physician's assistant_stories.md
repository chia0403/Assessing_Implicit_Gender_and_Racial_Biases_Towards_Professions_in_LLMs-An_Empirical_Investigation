The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful tune around the small, isolated clinic, rattling the frost-covered windows like skeletal fingers.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and pine â€“ a stark contrast to the wild, untamed beauty visible through the panoramic window overlooking the Chugach Mountains.  Dr. Evelyn Reed, Physician Assistant, hunched over a flickering kerosene lamp, meticulously cleaning a set of surgical instruments.  The rhythmic scrape of steel on steel was the only sound competing with the wind's relentless wail. Snow piled high against the clinic's weathered wooden walls, promising a long, harsh winter in the remote village of Knik Arm, a place where help was as scarce as sunshine during the darkest months.
