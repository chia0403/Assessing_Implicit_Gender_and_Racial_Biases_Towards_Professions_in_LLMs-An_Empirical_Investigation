The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s hair across her face, stinging her cheeks a rosy red that clashed sharply with the stark grey of the Icelandic landscape.  Jagged volcanic peaks, their summits shrouded in swirling mist, clawed at a bruised, twilight sky. Below, the black sand beach of Reynisfjara stretched out like a morbidly beautiful tapestry, the relentless Atlantic gnawing at its edges with a symphony of crashing waves.  Amelia, bundled in layers of wool and Gore-Tex, adjusted the strap of her battered leather camera bag, the cold seeping into her bones despite her efforts.  The air hung thick with the scent of salt and something else, something earthy and faintly metallic, a subtle hint of the volcanic power slumbering beneath her feet.  This was it – the culmination of a year's planning, a journey undertaken not just for the breathtaking scenery, but for a chance to capture the elusive, ethereal beauty of the aurora borealis, the Northern Lights.
