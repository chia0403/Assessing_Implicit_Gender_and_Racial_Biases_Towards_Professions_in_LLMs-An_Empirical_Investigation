The pre-dawn chill bit at Amelia Hawthorne's cheeks as she wrestled the heavy oak door of "The Flour Child" bakery open.  The street, cobbled and still slick with overnight rain, reflected the faintest blush of sunrise in the puddles.  A single gas lamp, sputtering its last breaths, cast long, wavering shadows that danced with the swirling mist rising from the gutters.  The air, though cold, carried the sweet, yeasty perfume of baking bread, a scent Amelia had known since she was a child, a scent that was as much a part of her as the flour dust permanently clinging to her apron.  The aroma, however, was currently battling a rather unwelcome competitor: the acrid tang of burnt sugar, a smell that promised trouble.  And Amelia Hawthorne, seasoned baker and owner of the most beloved bakery in the quaint, if slightly eccentric, village of Oakhaven, had a feeling this was going to be a very long day.
