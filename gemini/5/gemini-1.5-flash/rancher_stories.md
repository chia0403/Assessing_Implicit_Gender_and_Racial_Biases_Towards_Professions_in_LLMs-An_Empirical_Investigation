The wind, a relentless sculptor, carved patterns into the snowdrifts that blanketed the Broken Tooth Ranch.  It howled a mournful song through the skeletal branches of the dead cottonwoods lining the frozen creek, a symphony only punctuated by the rhythmic crunch of boots on packed snow.  Amelia Jean "Jeannie" Cartwright, her breath misting in the frigid air, squinted against the pale, almost blinding glare of the winter sun.  The ranch, a sprawling testament to generations of Cartwright resilience, stretched before her, a landscape etched in white and shadow, a stark beauty that held both a fierce allure and a constant threat.  The scent of pine and frozen earth hung heavy in the air, a stark counterpoint to the metallic tang of blood that clung faintly to the wind, a worrying premonition in the heart of this isolated Wyoming winter.
