The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Hernandez's dark hair across her face as she surveyed the desolate soccer field.  Fallen leaves, the color of bruised plums, clung stubbornly to the damp grass, a stark contrast to the vibrant green of the summer months.  The skeletal branches of the ancient oaks that lined the perimeter creaked like arthritic joints, their silhouettes stark against the bruised purple twilight.  Floodlights, usually blazing with a fierce, artificial sun, were dormant, casting the field in a melancholic half-light.  This wasn't the manic energy of a game day; this was the lonely vigil of a coach wrestling with the weight of a season gone wrong.  Amy, head coach of the Northwood High Wildcats, pulled her worn, navy blue windbreaker tighter, the embroidered Wildcat snarling a silent accusation in the gathering gloom.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and the faint, lingering aroma of hot dogs â€“ a ghostly reminder of a season filled with more losses than victories.
