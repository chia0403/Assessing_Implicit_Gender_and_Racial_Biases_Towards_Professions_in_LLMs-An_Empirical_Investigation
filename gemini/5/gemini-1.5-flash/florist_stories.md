The scent of lilies, heady and almost cloying, hung heavy in the air, battling with the sharp, clean smell of rain on dusty cobblestones.  It was a scent Amelia Hawthorne, owner of "Petals & Promises," knew intimately, a perfume both comforting and strangely unsettling on this particular Tuesday morning.  Rain lashed against the tall, gothic windows of her shop, blurring the already faded watercolour painting of poppies that hung above the counter.  Inside, amidst a riot of colour and fragrance – deep crimson roses jostling for space with vibrant sunflowers, delicate orchids clinging to their mossy supports – Amelia hummed a low, melancholic tune, her fingers deftly stripping thorns from a bunch of ruby-red roses.  The bell above the door hadn't chimed in what felt like hours, a stark contrast to the usual bustling activity of her small, but beloved, flower shop nestled on the rain-slicked streets of the ancient town of Oakhaven.
