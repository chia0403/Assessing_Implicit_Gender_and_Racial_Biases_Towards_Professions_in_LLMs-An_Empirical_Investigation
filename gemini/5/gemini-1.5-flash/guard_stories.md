The biting wind whipped at Sergeant Valerius Thorne’s cloak, stinging his cheeks raw.  He pulled the heavy wool tighter, the rough fabric scratching against the chainmail beneath.  Above him, the obsidian spires of the Citadel of Whispers clawed at the bruised purple sky, their jagged silhouettes etched against the fading light.  Below, the city of Porthaven sprawled like a festering wound, a labyrinth of narrow, cobbled streets choked with the smoke and shadows of a thousand flickering oil lamps.  The air hung thick with the smell of brine, roasting fish, and something else… something acrid and unsettling, like the breath of a dragon long since slain but not entirely forgotten.  Valerius shifted his weight, the cold seeping through the worn leather of his boots, and adjusted the grip on his halberd. Another patrol. Another night guarding the secrets the Citadel held close within its stony heart.
