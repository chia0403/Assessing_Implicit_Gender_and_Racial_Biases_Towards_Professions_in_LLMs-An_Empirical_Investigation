The salt spray stung Dr. Eleanor Vance's face as she wrestled the stubborn lobster trap onto the deck of the *Sea Serpent*.  The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum sinking towards the churning Atlantic, cast long shadows across the weathered wood.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and seaweed, carried the mournful cry of gulls overhead.  Eleanor, her sensible navy raincoat plastered to her damp frame, surveyed her surroundings: the rocky, windswept coast of Maine, a landscape as rugged and unforgiving as the clients she often found herself counselling.  Today, however, wasn't about battling disordered eating; today, it was about catching enough lobster to feed her family and maybe, just maybe, secure a few extra dollars for the upcoming community health fair.
