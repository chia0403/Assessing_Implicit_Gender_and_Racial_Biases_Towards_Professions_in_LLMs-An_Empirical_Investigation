The scent of coconut and vanilla hung heavy in the air, a cloying sweetness that usually soothed Seraphina "Sera" Moreau, but tonight it only served to amplify the tremor in her hands.  Sera, owner and operator of "Shear Perfection," a small but exquisitely decorated salon nestled on a cobblestone street in the heart of historic Charleston, South Carolina, stared at the reflection in the antique vanity mirror.  Rain lashed against the tall, arched windows, blurring the already fading gaslight glow of the street outside.  Inside, the salon was a haven of calm amidst the storm – a carefully curated sanctuary of soft lighting, plush velvet armchairs, and the low hum of a vintage hair dryer – but tonight, even this sanctuary felt claustrophobic.  The elegant, hand-painted floral wallpaper seemed to mock her with its unwavering serenity.  Tonight, Sera wasn't feeling perfect at all.
