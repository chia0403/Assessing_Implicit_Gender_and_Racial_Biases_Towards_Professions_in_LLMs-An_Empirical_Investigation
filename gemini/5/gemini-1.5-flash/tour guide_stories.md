The midday sun beat down on Amelia Hernandez’s neck, turning the already-sticky humidity of the Louisiana bayou into a suffocating blanket.  Cicadas buzzed a relentless, hypnotic drone, their song a counterpoint to the rhythmic slap of Amelia’s worn canvas shoes against the cypress knee-studded boardwalk.  The air hung heavy with the scent of decaying vegetation and the faint, sweet perfume of Spanish moss draping the ancient trees like ghostly shrouds.  Amelia adjusted the brim of her wide-brimmed straw hat, a weary sigh escaping her lips.  Another sweltering day guiding tourists through the Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve.  This particular group, a boisterous gaggle of twenty-something college students from Ohio, were proving to be more challenging than a tangle of Spanish moss in a hurricane.
