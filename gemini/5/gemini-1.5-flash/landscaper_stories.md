The dawn mist clung to the manicured lawns of Willow Creek Estates like a gauzy shroud, clinging to the dew-kissed blades of emerald grass and the velvety petals of countless roses.  A chill wind, sharp with the promise of autumn, whistled through the towering oak trees lining the curving driveway.  Elias Thorne, owner and operator of Thorne Landscaping, shivered, pulling his worn denim jacket tighter around his broad shoulders.  His breath plumed out in white puffs, momentarily obscuring the already fading pre-dawn light.  The silence of the upscale neighborhood was broken only by the rhythmic whirring of his trusty lawnmower, a comforting drone that was as familiar to him as the lines etched onto his calloused hands.  This morning, however, the usual tranquility feltâ€¦off.  A prickling unease settled in his stomach, a feeling as unwelcome as the creeping dampness seeping into his boots.
