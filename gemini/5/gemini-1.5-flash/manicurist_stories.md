The scent of acetone and lavender hung heavy in the air, a perfume as familiar to Seraphina "Sera" Moreau as her own skin.  Sera, perched on a stool behind her meticulously organized manicure station at "Nails of Serenity,"  glanced at the clock – 7:57 AM.  Two minutes until opening. Two minutes until the day's parade of chipped polish, broken nails, and whispered anxieties began their slow, steady march across her brightly lit salon nestled in the heart of bustling, eternally-caffeinated Montmartre.  Outside, the Parisian dawn painted the cobbled streets in hues of rose and apricot, a stark contrast to the muted greys and beiges of her workspace.  But even the vibrant sunrise couldn't quite chase away the unsettling feeling that clung to Sera like the stubborn remnants of glitter glue. This morning, something felt…different.  The usual comforting rhythm of her day was off-kilter, a discordant note in the otherwise harmonious symphony of nail files and dryers.
