The chipped paint of Mrs. Eleanor Vance's classroom desk flaked onto the already-cluttered surface: a half-eaten bag of licorice whips, a stack of ungraded spelling tests threatening to topple like a Jenga tower, and a single, lonely crayon stub – cerulean blue – clinging precariously to the edge.  Outside, the November wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the ancient windowpanes of Oakwood Elementary.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of glue, overripe apples, and the faint, lingering aroma of something vaguely resembling burnt popcorn – a testament to the chaotic, yet endearing, energy that was fourth grade.  Eleanor sighed, the weight of twenty-five eight-year-olds pressing down on her more heavily than any stack of papers ever could.  The afternoon light, a pale, watery sun struggling to break through the gathering storm clouds, painted long shadows across the room, emphasizing the dust motes dancing in the air like tiny, mischievous sprites.
