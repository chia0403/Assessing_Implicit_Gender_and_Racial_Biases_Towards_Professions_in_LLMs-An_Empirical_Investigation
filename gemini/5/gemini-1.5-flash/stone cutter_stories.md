The wind, a rasping chisel against the granite cliffs, whipped Elias Thorne’s already chapped lips.  He spat a stream of icy saliva that froze mid-air before shattering on the jagged rocks below.  The air hung thick with the scent of brine and the faint, metallic tang of blood – not his own, thankfully, but the lingering memory of the seals that had hauled themselves onto the treacherous ledges the previous night.  Elias, his hands calloused and scarred like the weathered cliffs themselves, adjusted the worn leather strap of his hammer. He surveyed his work: a half-finished gargoyle, its stony face frozen in a perpetual snarl, perched precariously on the edge of the precipice overlooking the churning grey expanse of the North Sea.  The village of Port Blossom, a cluster of whitewashed cottages clinging to the cliffside like barnacles, lay nestled far below, dwarfed by the imposing majesty of the unforgiving, windswept landscape.  This was his canvas, this brutal beauty his masterpiece.
