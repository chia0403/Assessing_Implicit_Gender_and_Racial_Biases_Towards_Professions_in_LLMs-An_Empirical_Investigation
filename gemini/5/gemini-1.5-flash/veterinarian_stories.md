The biting November wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vance’s hair across her face as she wrestled the heavy oak door of the Alder Creek Animal Hospital open.  The scent that greeted her was a familiar, pungent cocktail: antiseptic, wet dog, and a faint undercurrent of something distinctly…feral.  Alder Creek, nestled deep in the Oregon Coast Range, wasn't exactly a bustling metropolis; its population consisted mainly of weathered fishermen, eccentric artists, and a surprising number of creatures with four legs, wings, or scales, all needing Eleanor’s expertise.  The small, single-story building creaked in protest under the weight of the wind, its windows rattling like skeletal fingers against the glass. Inside, the only sound was the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the reception area, a relentless counterpoint to the storm raging outside.  Tonight, however, the usual quiet hum of the clinic was overshadowed by a sense of unease, a prickling sensation at the back of Eleanor's neck that had nothing to do with the cold.
