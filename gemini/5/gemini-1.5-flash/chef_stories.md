The salt spray stung Auguste Gustave Dubois's face as he wrestled the recalcitrant fishing boat's net onto the deck.  The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum sinking behind the jagged teeth of the Île de Sein, cast long shadows across the churning grey water.  The air, thick with the smell of brine and seaweed, carried a sharper, almost metallic tang – the scent of blood, barely masked by the pervasive aroma of the sea. Auguste, his chef's whites stained with fish guts and seawater, gripped the sodden rope, his knuckles bone-white.  This wasn't the pristine, stainless-steel kitchen of his Michelin-starred restaurant in Paris; this was the unforgiving, wild heart of Brittany, and tonight, his culinary masterpiece would depend entirely on the bounty – or lack thereof – of the unforgiving Atlantic.
