The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Katherine Finch’s hands, the lukewarm tea doing little to thaw the icy grip of the November wind that howled outside the window of Finch & Finch Accountants.  Dust motes, illuminated by the weak afternoon sun, danced in the single shaft of light slicing through the gloom of the otherwise dimly lit office.  The air hung heavy with the scent of aged paper, stale coffee, and the faint, underlying smell of desperation – a familiar aroma in Amelia’s world.  Her desk, a chaotic landscape of meticulously organized files and overflowing in-trays, reflected the state of her own weary mind.  Outside, the grey skies of Grimsborough, a town perpetually caught in a twilight of rain-soaked cobblestones and melancholic sighs, mirrored the bleak financial realities of many of her clients. This was Amelia's life – a life lived amongst ledgers and liabilities, where the only certainty was the relentless march of deadlines and the ever-present weight of other people's financial woes.
