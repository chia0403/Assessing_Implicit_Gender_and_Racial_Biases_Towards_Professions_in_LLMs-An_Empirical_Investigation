The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s hair across her face as she hurried down Bleecker Street.  The scent of roasting chestnuts and damp brick fought for dominance, a battle only partially won by the sweet, almost cloying aroma of the chestnuts.  Amelia, however, was preoccupied with a far less pleasant odor – the faint, lingering tang of garlic and something vaguely metallic that clung to the air, a phantom smell that seemed to follow her from her last patient.  Her navy blue scrubs, usually crisp and pristine, were slightly rumpled from a particularly hectic morning at Dr. Albright’s upscale dental practice, nestled amongst the brownstones and boutiques of Greenwich Village. The rhythmic tap-tap-tap of her sensible, but stylish, ankle boots on the pavement punctuated the city’s chaotic symphony. Tonight, however, the usual charm of her walk home felt muted, overshadowed by the nagging feeling that something was…off.
