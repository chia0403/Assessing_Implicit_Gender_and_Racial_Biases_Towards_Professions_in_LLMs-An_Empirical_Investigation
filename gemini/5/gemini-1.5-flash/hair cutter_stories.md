The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume only Amelia “Mia” Hernandez’s salon, *Shear Genius*, could produce.  Rain lashed against the warped, stained-glass windowpanes of her tiny shop, tucked away on a cobbled side street in the ancient, crumbling heart of Seville.  The street, Calle de la Alfalfa, was usually bustling with tourists, their chatter a vibrant counterpoint to the melancholic strumming of a nearby guitarist.  Tonight, however, it was eerily deserted, the only sounds the drumming rain and the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of Mia’s shears as she worked on a half-finished bob, the client long gone, leaving behind only a lingering cloud of hairspray and the faint aroma of expensive perfume.  The flickering gaslight above her mirrored station cast long, dancing shadows across the worn wooden floorboards, making the already intimate space feel even smaller, more intensely private.
