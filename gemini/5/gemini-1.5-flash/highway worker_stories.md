The biting November wind whipped across the desolate expanse of the Nevada desert, stinging Elias Thorne’s cheeks raw.  Dust, the colour of burnt ochre, swirled around his worn work boots as he wrestled with a stubborn bolt on a fractured guardrail.  The sun, a weak, watery orb sinking towards the jagged peaks of the distant mountains, cast long, skeletal shadows that stretched and writhed like phantoms across the I-80 Eastbound.  The air, thin and cold, carried the metallic tang of diesel fumes and the faint, unsettling scent of sagebrush – a smell Elias usually found comforting, but tonight, it only served to heighten the growing unease in his gut.  He was miles from the nearest town, the only sound besides the wind the occasional, mournful groan of the battered pickup truck parked a hundred yards behind him – his solitary companion for the last five hours.  Elias, a man hardened by years of sun, grit, and the unforgiving nature of the Nevada highways, felt a prickle of fear he couldn’t quite explain. Tonight, the desert felt… different.
