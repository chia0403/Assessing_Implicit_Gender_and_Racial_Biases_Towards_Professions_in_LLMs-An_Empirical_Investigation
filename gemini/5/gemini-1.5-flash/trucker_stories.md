The biting November wind howled a mournful tune across the desolate expanse of the Nebraska plains, rattling the windows of Dale "Mac" McAlister's eighteen-wheeler like skeletal fingers tapping a frantic rhythm.  Mac, his full name a cumbersome relic of a bygone era rarely used except on official paperwork, wrestled the steering wheel of his rig, a beat-up Kenworth he affectionately called "Betsy," fighting to keep her on the ice-slicked highway.  Headlights cut through the swirling snow, illuminating only a fleeting glimpse of the endless, grey landscape before plunging back into the opaque white.  The only sound louder than the wind was the relentless drumming of Betsy's tires against the treacherous road, punctuated by the occasional groan of protest from the aging engine.  Ahead, the looming silhouette of a deserted gas station, its lights flickering weakly like a dying ember, offered the only promise of warmth and respite in this frozen wasteland.
