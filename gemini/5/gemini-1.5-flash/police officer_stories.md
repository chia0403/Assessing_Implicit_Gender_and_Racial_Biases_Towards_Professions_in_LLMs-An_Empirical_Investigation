The salt spray stung Officer Amelia "Mia" Hernandez's face as she wrestled the battered patrol car onto the slick, rain-lashed road.  Headlights cut feeble swathes through the churning grey of the Atlantic, illuminating only the immediate stretch of Highway 17 before swallowing it back into the encroaching darkness.  The wind howled a mournful dirge around the skeletal remains of the cypress trees lining the coast, their gnarled branches clawing at the bruised sky.  This desolate stretch of North Carolina coastline, usually a picturesque postcard, was tonight a brooding, unforgiving beast, mirroring the unease that had settled deep in Mia's gut since the call came in â€“ a missing person, circumstances unspecified, last seen near the abandoned lighthouse at Cape Lookout.  The radio crackled with static, a fitting soundtrack to the growing sense of dread.
