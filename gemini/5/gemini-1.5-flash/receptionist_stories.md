The fluorescent lights of the Zenith Corporation hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Penelope Anne Featherstonehaugh's otherwise silent existence behind the polished mahogany reception desk.  Penelope, or Penny as she preferred (though few ever dared), meticulously arranged a stack of perfectly aligned brochures, the glossy paper reflecting the harsh glare like tiny mirrors.  Outside, the Chicago wind howled a mournful dirge against the towering skyscraper, a stark contrast to the hushed, almost sterile calm within Zenith's opulent lobby.  The scent of expensive, faintly floral air freshener warred with the lingering aroma of stale coffee from the breakroom down the hall, a constant reminder of the day's inevitable grind.  Today, however, felt different.  A subtle unease, a prickling at the back of Penny's neck, suggested that the usual humdrum of answering phones and directing visitors was about to be disrupted in a most unexpected way.
