The Los Angeles sun, a malevolent eye in the bruised purple sky, beat down on Isabella “Izzy” Rodriguez’s neck as she surveyed the chaotic mess that was her latest film set.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of grit and despair, danced across the abandoned gas station, mocking the carefully placed period props – a rusted 1957 Chevy Bel Air, a chipped Coca-Cola sign, and a collection of vintage cigarette packs that looked suspiciously new.  Izzy, sporting a faded band t-shirt beneath her director’s jacket, squinted, the glare reflecting off her aviator sunglasses.  The air hung thick with the scent of gasoline, desperation, and impending rain, a fitting aroma for a neo-noir thriller about a femme fatale, a crooked cop, and a suitcase full of unmarked bills – a project that was currently threatening to bankrupt her and send her back to directing low-budget commercials for hemorrhoid cream.
