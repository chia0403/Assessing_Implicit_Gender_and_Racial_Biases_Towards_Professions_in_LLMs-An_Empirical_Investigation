The chipped porcelain mug warmed Dr. Eleanor Vance’s hands, a meager defense against the pre-dawn chill that clung to the Seattle air. Rain, a relentless percussionist, hammered against the windowpanes of her office, mirroring the relentless rhythm of anxieties that pulsed through her waiting room.

Tonight, however, the usual comfort was absent, replaced by a gnawing unease that even the strongest chamomile tea couldn't soothe.  The last patient had left an hour ago, but the lingering scent of her perfume – something sharp and cloying, like lilies dipped in formaldehyde – clung stubbornly to the air, a ghostly reminder of a session that had left Eleanor profoundly unsettled.
