It was a Tuesday, and the usual Tuesday chaos reigned: the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of scissors, the whir of the hairdryer battling the insistent chatter of three gossiping clients perched precariously on velvet chairs, and the low hum of Auri’s own focused concentration.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sunbeams slanting through the large bay window overlooking the cobbled street of Willow Creek, a quaint, almost comically picturesque village nestled in the heart of the Cotswolds.  Auri, her fingers deftly weaving through a client’s thick auburn hair, barely registered the scene.  Her mind, however, was far from the perfectly symmetrical bob she was crafting.  It was preoccupied with a letter, a stark white envelope lying unopened on her cluttered desk, its elegant script promising trouble as surely as the rising tide promises the eventual soaking of the sand.
