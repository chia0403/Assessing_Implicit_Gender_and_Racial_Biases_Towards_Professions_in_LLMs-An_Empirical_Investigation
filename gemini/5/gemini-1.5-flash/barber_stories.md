The scent of bay rum and Old Spice hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume that clung to the worn, cherry-wood walls of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's barbershop.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single, unshaded bulb hanging over the lone barber chair, danced in the afternoon sun slicing through the grimy windowpane.  Barty, a man whose life seemed as neatly trimmed as the sideburns he so expertly sculpted, sat polishing his straight razor with a practiced hand, the rhythmic squeak of steel on leather a counterpoint to the mournful drone of a distant foghorn.  Outside, the relentless grey of the North Sea churned against the jagged cliffs of Covehaven, a town clinging precariously to the edge of the world.  This was Barty’s world – a small, contained space of sharp blades, whispered confidences, and the quiet rhythm of a life lived at the edge of the ocean's roar.
