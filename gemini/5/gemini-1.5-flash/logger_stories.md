The air, thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, carried the faint, metallic tang of blood â€“ a lingering reminder of the mountain lion that had claimed a young deer just days before.  The silence, broken only by the wind and the distant creak of snow-laden branches, was a deceptive calm, the prelude to a day of back-breaking labor in the heart of the unforgiving wilderness.
