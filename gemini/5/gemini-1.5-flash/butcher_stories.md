The rusty swing of the butcher's cleaver echoed through the cavernous chill of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's shop, a sound as familiar to him as his own heartbeat.  Barty, a man whose hands were perpetually stained a deep crimson that wouldn't quite scrub away, even with lye soap and bristle brushes, surveyed his domain.  It wasn't much â€“ a cramped, wood-panelled space on the edge of Grimsborough, a town clinging precariously to the edge of the whispering moors.  The air hung thick with the metallic tang of blood and the faintly sweet aroma of rendered fat, a scent that most found repellent, but to Barty, was as comforting as a warm hearth on a winter's night.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the single, grimy windowpane and scattering a flurry of snow across the cobbled street. The meager gaslight above sputtered, casting long, dancing shadows that played tricks on the rows of hanging carcasses, making them seem to twitch and writhe in the gloom.
