The fluorescent lights of "Quick Stop Mart" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Elara Vance's life.  Elara, a name her grandmother had chosen, meaning "shining light," felt anything but radiant at 11:17 pm on a Tuesday.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the already indistinct streetlights into hazy halos.  The only other occupants of the convenience store, besides Elara and the eternally buzzing refrigerator, were a half-eaten bag of stale chips abandoned on a shelf and a single, wilting carnation in a cracked vase on the counter.  The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and something vaguely chemical, a smell Elara had long since ceased to notice.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful ballad, promising a long, cold night.
