The acrid bite of woodsmoke clung to Amelia “Amy” Hernandez’s throat, a familiar companion on nights like these.  The Santa Ana winds, howling like banshees through the canyons of San Bernardino, whipped at the flames licking the dry chaparral, turning the already-fierce fire into a raging beast.  Flickering orange light painted the sky a hellish canvas, illuminating the chaotic ballet of fire trucks, their sirens a mournful counterpoint to the crackling inferno.  Amy, her helmet slightly askew, surveyed the scene from atop a rocky outcrop, the heat radiating up from the ground like a phantom’s breath.  Her fire-resistant Nomex gear felt heavy, almost suffocating, but the adrenaline coursing through her veins kept her sharp, her focus unwavering. The air vibrated with the crackle of the flames and the urgent shouts of her fellow firefighters, a symphony of controlled chaos that was, for Amy, the sound of home.
