The chipped Formica bar top gleamed under the sickly yellow light of the "Rusty Mug," reflecting the weary lines etched onto the face of Amelia Josephine Hernandez.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale beer, spilled whiskey, and the faint, lingering sweetness of Amelia’s signature lavender-infused simple syrup – a stark contrast to the bitterness that clung to her tonight. Outside, the neon sign flickered intermittently, casting a lurid glow on the deserted alleyway, a silent testament to the late hour and the city’s slow descent into sleep.  Inside, only a single, solitary figure occupied one of the worn leather stools, nursing a glass of amber liquid and staring blankly into the swirling depths.  Amelia knew that look.  She'd seen it reflected in countless pairs of eyes over her ten years behind this bar – the look of quiet desperation, the weight of unspoken words.  Tonight, however, it felt heavier, more personal.
