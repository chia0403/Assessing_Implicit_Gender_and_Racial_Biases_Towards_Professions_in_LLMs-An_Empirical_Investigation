The chipped porcelain teacup trembled in Seraphina “Sera” Nightingale’s hand, mirroring the tremor in her own voice as the news seeped in.  Rain lashed against the tall, arched windows of her attic studio, mirroring the storm brewing inside her.  The scent of turpentine and old sheet music hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume that usually comforted, but tonight felt suffocating.  Dust motes, illuminated by a single, bare bulb hanging precariously from the ceiling, danced in the swirling gloom.  Outside, the cobbled streets of Prague’s Žižkov district were a cacophony of honking trams and distant, melancholic accordion music – a soundtrack entirely inappropriate to the devastating silence that had just fallen upon Sera.  Her beloved grandmother, Elara, the woman who’d nurtured her talent from the first wobbly note, was gone.  And with her, the legacy of their family's renowned opera house, the Nightingale Theatre, seemed to be vanishing too.
