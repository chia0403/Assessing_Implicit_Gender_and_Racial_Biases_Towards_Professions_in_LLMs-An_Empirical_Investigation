The flickering neon sign of "Leaky Pipes & Rusty Remedies" cast a sickly yellow glow across the rain-slicked alley.  Water, a constant companion to Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, Jr., dripped from the eaves, pooling in the grime-coated gutters.  Barty, a plumber with a perpetually weary expression and hands perpetually stained with a mixture of grease and copper, peered through the condensation-fogged window of his battered van.  Tonight, the usual clamor of city noises – honking taxis, sirens wailing, the distant rumble of a subway – was strangely muted. An unsettling quiet settled over the alley, broken only by the rhythmic drip, drip, drip of the leaky pipe above.  Tonight, it wasn't just a leaky pipe Barty was after.  This job held a whisper of something else entirely.  The address, scrawled in shaky cursive on the tattered receipt clutched in his calloused hand, read: 13 Whispering Willow Lane.
