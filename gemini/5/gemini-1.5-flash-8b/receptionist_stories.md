The fluorescent lights of the Zenith Corporation hummed, a monotonous drone that perpetually vibrated through the chipped Formica countertop.  Amelia Kensington, receptionist extraordinaire (or at least, that's what the embossed gold lettering on her nameplate declared), stared blankly at the blinking cursor on her computer screen.  Another Tuesday, another barrage of unsolicited emails promising revolutionary new bio-engineered fabrics and groundbreaking advancements in quantum entanglement.  The clock on the wall ticked with irritating precision, each second a hammer blow to her already dwindling patience.

The Zenith Corporation, a high-rise towering over the perpetually overcast city of Aethelgard, was a monument to sleek minimalism.  Chrome and glass reflected the grey sky, creating a shimmering, almost sterile environment.  Ameliaâ€™s cubicle, tucked away in a corner office, was a stark contrast to the polished perfection surrounding it.  A chipped mug sat precariously on the edge of her desk, a forgotten latte staining the ceramic.  Post-it notes, overflowing with cryptic requests and scribbled reminders, clung to the walls, a testament to the unpredictable whims of Zenith's clientele.  Amelia, in her faded grey cardigan and slightly oversized glasses, was the only splash of colour in a world of muted tones.  Her neatly bunned hair, usually a defiant cascade of auburn, felt suffocatingly tight against her skull.
