The chipped paint of the "Artist's Retreat" sign, a faded, ochre-yellow now more terracotta, barely clung to its rusted metal frame.  Rain slicked the cobblestones of the alley, reflecting the sickly light of the early morning sun in fractured rainbows.  This was where Elara Nightingale found her sanctuary, her studio swallowed by the heart of the crumbling city.  Elara, a painter of delicate watercolours and brooding oils, lived a solitary life, her brush her confidant, her canvas a blank page begging to be filled with the stories she couldn't quite articulate.  The air hung thick with the scent of damp earth and something akin to burnt sugar, a constant reminder of the bakery on the other side of the alley, a cheerful counterpoint to the muted melancholy of her own existence. The alley itself, a narrow fissure in the city's otherwise imposing facade, was a world of its own, a miniature theatre of shadows and whispered secrets where the city's rhythm slowed to a hushed murmur.  Today, however, the murmur was unusually loud.
