Professor Eleanor Vance, a woman whose tweed jacket seemed perpetually dusted with the faintest film of scholarly grime, adjusted her spectacles.  The air in the hallowed halls of the University of Ashwoodâ€™s history department hung thick with the scent of aged paper and forgotten ambition. Sunlight, fractured by the stained-glass window depicting the legendary founding fathers of Ashwood, cast long, dancing shadows across the room.  Dust motes, caught in the golden rays, swirled like tiny, ethereal spirits.  This particular Wednesday afternoon was, as always, unusually quiet.  The usual buzz of student chatter, the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of keyboards, the low murmur of debate had faded into an almost unnerving stillness.  Eleanor, surrounded by towering bookshelves overflowing with volumes chronicling centuries of human folly and brilliance, felt a prickle of unease.  The silence was suffocating, a prelude to something...different.  The air itself seemed to vibrate with an unspoken energy, an energy that had been absent for the past three weeks.
