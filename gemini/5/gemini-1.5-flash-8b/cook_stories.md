The aroma of simmering thyme and rosemary, thick with the promise of roasted lamb, hung heavy in the air.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom of the small kitchen, illuminating the chipped porcelain sink and the worn wooden counter where Amelia Dubois, a cook with a heart as fiery as the hearth beneath her, meticulously arranged fresh herbs.  The rhythmic click of her knife against the cutting board was a lullaby, a counterpoint to the boisterous chatter emanating from the bustling market square outside.

Amelia’s tiny kitchen, nestled within the heart of the old cobblestone city of Verona, was a symphony of muted colours and pungent spices.  The walls, a faded ochre, were lined with rows of terracotta pots bursting with herbs and vegetables – vibrant jewels against the backdrop of aged stone.  A rickety wooden table, scarred from countless meals and years of use, dominated the centre of the space, piled high with glistening vegetables and herbs awaiting their fate on the morrow's menu.  The rhythmic pulse of the nearby river, the Adige, a constant murmur of life and industry, echoed in the quiet kitchen, a reminder of the lively world beyond the door.  Today, however, a simmering unease threatened to drown out the melody of her daily routine.
