The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow over the rain-slicked cobblestones of Old Town.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of stale beer and woodsmoke.  Barkeep, Elias Thorne, leaned against the mahogany bar, his weary eyes tracing the condensation dripping from the chipped glass decanter of absinthe.  The rhythmic clinking of glasses and low murmur of conversations formed a constant, familiar hum, punctuated by the occasional, sharp cry from the alleyway outside.  Tonight, however, the usual chaos felt muted, almostâ€¦ expectant.  Elias knew the feeling.  It was the pre-storm quiet.  And he hated it.
