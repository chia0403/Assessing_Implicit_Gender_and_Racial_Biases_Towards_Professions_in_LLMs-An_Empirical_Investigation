The wind, a relentless, clawing beast, whipped at Bartholomew "Barty" Grimshaw's weathered jacket, threatening to rip him from the precarious perch atop the crumbling Victorian mansion.  Rain, the colour of charcoal, hammered against the slate tiles, each drop a tiny percussionist in a symphony of misery.  Below, the cobbled streets of the Old Town, normally bustling with the rhythmic clatter of hooves and the murmur of vendors, were swallowed by a suffocating grey.  This wasn't just a storm; it felt like the very essence of the city itself was groaning under the pressure.  Barty, his calloused hands gripping the frayed rope, felt a tremor run through the ancient stone beneath his feet.  The house, named Blackwood Manor, seemed to be shuddering in sympathy with the tempest.

Barty, a roofer for nearly twenty years, knew these storms intimately. He knew the way the wind howled through the decaying eaves, the way the rain carved furrows in the grime-coated gutters, and the subtle shifts in the groaning timbers that signaled impending disaster.  But this stormâ€¦ this storm felt different.  It felt as if it held a secret, a malevolent presence whispering through the lashing rain.  He'd felt it simmering beneath the surface all week, a sense of foreboding that had gnawed at him, a persistent uneasiness that made him want to crawl back down and into the warmth of the pub, or the safety of his small, cluttered attic workshop.  This wasn't just a job; this was an intrusion. An intrusion he had to investigate.
