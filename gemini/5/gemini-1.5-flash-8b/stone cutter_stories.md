The chipped granite dust, the colour of aged parchment, swirled around Elara Blackwood, clinging to the edges of her worn leather apron.  The air in the quarry, a cavernous maw carved into the heart of the Whispering Hills, hung thick with the scent of damp earth and the faint, metallic tang of iron.  Sunlight, fractured into shards by the towering, jagged cliffs, struggled to penetrate the gloom, painting the stone floor in a mosaic of shifting shadows.  Elara, her hands calloused and stained a deep ochre, worked with a relentless focus.  Her hammer, a familiar weight in her calloused grip, echoed against the rough-hewn stone, a rhythmic percussion against the silence of the quarry.  This was her world, this was her life, carved into the very heart of the mountain.
