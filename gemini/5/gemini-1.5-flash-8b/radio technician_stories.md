The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Spigot" cast a sickly yellow glow across the alley, barely illuminating the grime-coated walls that whispered tales of forgotten dreams and spilled beer.  Rain, a persistent, insistent drumming against the corrugated iron roof, amplified the low hum of the city, a constant, almost palpable energy that thrummed beneath Amelia "Sparky"  Fitzwilliam's fingertips as she meticulously adjusted a potentiometer on her workbench.  Sparky, a radio technician with a lifetime of tangled wires and whispered secrets etched onto her calloused palms, wasn't interested in the city's boisterous rhythms.  She was listening to something else entirely, something faint, somethingâ€¦ distant.

The alley, a forgotten pocket of the sprawling metropolis, was her sanctuary, a place where the insistent clamor of the outside world faded to a barely audible whisper.  Her workshop, cramped and cluttered with a dizzying array of salvaged components, old capacitors, and defunct televisions, was her world.  Broken radios, like wounded birds, lay scattered on tables, waiting for Sparky's touch, her knowledge, her empathy.  The rhythmic click of her soldering iron was a lullaby in this concrete wilderness, and the faint crackle of static, a promise of signals yet to be deciphered.
