The air in "The Butcher's Block," hung thick with the scent of rosemary, aged cheddar, and something subtly metallic, like blood just past its prime.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the grime-coated windows of the small shop.  It was a Wednesday, the slowest day of the week, and Bartholomew "Barty" Grimshaw, proprietor of The Butcher's Block, leaned against a cold, polished slab of granite, meticulously sharpening his cleaver.  The rhythmic *thunk* of steel on steel echoed in the otherwise silent space, a lullaby to the quiet town of Oakhaven.

Barty, a man whose face was as weathered and scarred as the old oak table in the corner, was a butcher through and through.  His hands, calloused and strong, had wielded knives and axes since he was a lad, shaping and slicing, creating beauty from the raw.  But tonight, the usual quiet satisfaction was absent.  A nagging sense of unease, like a fly buzzing around a still pool, settled in his gut.  He traced the patterns in the grain of the mahogany counter, the swirls mirroring the turmoil in his soul.  He felt it in the trembling of his calloused hands, an echo of something he'd heard, something whispered on the wind, something dark and ominous.  Oakhaven, usually a placid place, held an unsettling stillness tonight, almost like it was holding its breath.
