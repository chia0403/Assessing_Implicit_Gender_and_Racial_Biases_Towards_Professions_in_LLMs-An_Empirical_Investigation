The biting wind, a relentless harbinger of winter, whipped across the exposed peaks of the Bitterroot Mountains, stinging Elias Thorne's cheeks and rattling the loose boards of his small cabin.  Snow, a relentless, white shroud, had already begun its slow, inexorable descent, blanketing the rugged landscape in an oppressive stillness.  The air, thin and crisp, carried the scent of pine needles and the faint, metallic tang of the timber he knew so intimately.  Elias, a seasoned logger with calloused hands and eyes the color of a stormy sky, sat hunched by the crackling fire, the rhythmic snap of the flames mirroring the relentless rhythm of his thoughts.  His weathered face, etched with the stories of a thousand felled trees, reflected the solitude of the mountain valley, a solitude that had become a familiar companion.


The setting was the high country of the Bitterroot Valley, Montana, in the late 1880s.  The valley, carved deep into the jagged peaks, was a land of stark beauty and unforgiving wilderness.  Eliasâ€™ cabin, nestled precariously on a steep hillside, was a testament to the rugged independence of the lumberjacks who called these mountains home.  It was a small, one-room structure, built of rough-hewn logs, its walls scarred and weathered by the elements.  Inside, the flickering firelight danced on the rough-hewn tables and chairs, casting long, dancing shadows on the worn, leather-bound books that lined a shelf.  The scent of pine needles and damp earth hung heavy in the air, punctuated by the faint, sweet smell of firewood being burned.  The valley stretched out before him, a vast expanse of snow-dusted peaks and valleys, a silent kingdom waiting to be tamed.
