Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the probation office, a relentless drumming that mirrored the relentless beat of Sergeant Amelia Hayesâ€™s own thoughts.  The chipped Formica desk, stained with decades of spilled coffee and the faint ghost of burnt toast, felt colder than usual.  Outside, the grey city of Alderhaven sprawled beneath a bruised sky, a sprawling metropolis built on the foundations of forgotten dreams and even more forgotten promises.  Amelia, a probation officer with the city's Juvenile Justice Department, stared at the file in front of her, a stack of paper thick with the details of 17-year-old Leo Vance's life.


Setting:

Alderhaven, a sprawling, grey city choked with smog and overgrown with the tangled vines of urban decay.  Towering, skeletal apartment buildings clawed at the overcast sky, their windows like vacant eyes staring out at a perpetual twilight.  A palpable sense of unease hung heavy in the air, a mix of despair and simmering resentment.  The streets, though well-maintained, lacked the vibrancy of life, the only sounds the rhythmic thud of rain and the occasional distant siren.  The probation office itself was a relic, a bunker-like building on the outskirts of the city, a stark contrast to the gleaming high-rise towers where the city's elite resided.  Its walls seemed to whisper stories of broken promises and lost opportunities, of the city's hidden struggles, all trapped within the rigid structure of a justice system perpetually at odds with the realities of the world it sought to contain.
