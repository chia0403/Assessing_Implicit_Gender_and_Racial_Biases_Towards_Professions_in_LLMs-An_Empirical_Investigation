The chipped Formica countertop hummed with the faint, almost imperceptible thrum of the ancient refrigerator, a symphony of rusted metal and forgotten meals.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single, flickering fluorescent bulb above, danced in the midday sunbeams slanting through the grimy window of Amelia Blackwood’s cramped apartment.  Amelia, a writer of fractured narratives and dissonant poems, hunched over her battered laptop, the relentless rhythm of the blinking cursor a constant, irritating counterpoint to the clattering of dishes from the apartment below.  Her nose, perpetually dusted with the fine, grey residue of countless cups of lukewarm tea, wrinkled in concentration.  Today, however, the words refused to coalesce.  The plot, the characters, even the setting – a sprawling, sun-drenched coastal town called Havenwood – felt stubbornly evasive.  The coastal wind, usually a comforting companion, today carried the tang of something else, something sharp and metallic, whispering through the gaps in the window.  The story was lost somewhere between the pages of her notebook and the forgotten corners of her mind, a phantom limb aching with unfulfilled potential.
