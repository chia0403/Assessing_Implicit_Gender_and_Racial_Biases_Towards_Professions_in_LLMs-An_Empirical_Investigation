The biting wind whipped at the cab of the "Iron Horse," a paint-chipped, 1980s Freightliner rumbling across the desolate plains of the Nebraska panhandle.  Dust devils danced across the cracked earth, mimicking the frantic beat of Elias "Jake" Jakobs's heart.  The year was 1992.  The air, thin and dry, tasted of burnt sugar and impending despair.  Jake, weathered and weary, squinted into the fading light, his weathered face creased with worry.  A single, almost imperceptible tremor ran through the chassis of the truck, a tremor that echoed the growing unease in his gut.  He was almost at the town of Dusty Gulch, a place whispered about in hushed tones among the drivers, a place where legends, both real and imagined, clung to the parched earth like dust motes.  Dusty Gulch was a crossroads of forgotten highways and faded dreams, a ghost town waiting to swallow anything that dared stray too close.
