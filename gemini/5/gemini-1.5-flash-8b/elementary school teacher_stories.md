Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Miss Amelia Peabody’s classroom, a relentless drumming that mirrored the frantic rhythm of her thoughts.  The air, thick with the scent of mildew and damp earth, clung to the worn wooden desks and chipped paint of Room 2B at Oakhaven Elementary.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the grimy window, illuminating a scene of chaotic calm.  Crayon shavings littered the floor like fallen autumn leaves, a testament to the vibrant energy of the thirty first graders she so adored.  But today, even the cheerful chatter of the children seemed muffled by the storm outside, and Miss Peabody felt a creeping unease, a feeling she couldn’t quite place.  Her name, a delicate balance of practicality and poetic charm, seemed somehow insufficient to the weight of the day.
