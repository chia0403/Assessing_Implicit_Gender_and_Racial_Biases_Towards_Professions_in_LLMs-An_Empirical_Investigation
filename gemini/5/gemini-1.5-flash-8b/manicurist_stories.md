The chipped porcelain sink of "Graceful Nails" gleamed under the harsh fluorescent lights, reflecting the frantic movements of Amelia  Ashworth.  Her manicured hands, normally adept at shaping and smoothing, fumbled with a particularly stubborn acrylic.  A frantic melody, a mix of classical guitar and techno, pulsed from the tiny speakers hidden beneath a stack of nail art books.  Amelia, barely twenty-three, wore a smile that seemed permanently plastered on her face, a facade masking the growing knot of anxiety in her stomach.  It was the first appointment of the day, a crucial one.  Her client, the notoriously demanding Madame Evangeline Dubois, was known for her extravagant tastes and even more extravagant expectations.  Outside, the city of Veridian hummed, a chaotic symphony of honking taxis and distant sirens, a stark contrast to the artificially serene atmosphere inside the tiny salon.  Graceful Nails was nestled in the heart of the city's bustling, historic district, tucked away on a side street lined with antique shops and crumbling, yet magnificent, Victorian buildings.  A delicate floral aroma, a blend of lilies and jasmine, emanated from Amelia's workspace, a desperate attempt to drown out the cacophony of her racing thoughts.
