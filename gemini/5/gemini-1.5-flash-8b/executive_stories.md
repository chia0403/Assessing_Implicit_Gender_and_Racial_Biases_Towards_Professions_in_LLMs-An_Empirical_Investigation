The fluorescent lights of the Zenith Corporation headquarters hummed, a constant, irritating drone that seemed to vibrate through Amelia Petrova's very bones.  Her tailored suit, navy blue and impeccably pressed, felt like a lead weight.  Rain hammered against the panoramic windows, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  The city of New Avalon, a shimmering metropolis built on the promise of technological advancement, felt more like a gilded cage than a beacon of progress.

Amelia Petrova, Senior Vice President of Zenith's Quantum Systems division, stared out at the cityscape.  Below, the sleek, chrome skyscrapers reflected the storm clouds, a stark contrast to the grey, clinical atmosphere of her office.  The aroma of expensive coffee, a staple in the executive boardroom, lingered, a faint reminder of the countless meetings sheâ€™d endured, the countless presentations she'd delivered, the countless compromises she'd made.  Today, however, a different kind of storm raged within her.  It wasn't a storm of frustration or anger; it was a storm of impending revelation, a storm threatening to upend everything she thought she knew about Zenith and its groundbreaking quantum technology.
