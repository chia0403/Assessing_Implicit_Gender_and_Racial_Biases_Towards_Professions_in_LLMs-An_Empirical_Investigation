The biting wind whipped Amelia “Amy” Sterling’s crimson scarf around her neck, a stark contrast to the muted greys and browns of the abandoned amusement park.  Rows of rusted rollercoasters, their skeletal frames clawing at a bruised sky, offered a chilling backdrop to the rusted metal swing set where Amy hunched, a worn copy of "The Wizard of Oz" clutched in her hands.  The air, thick with the scent of decay and something vaguely sweet, like overripe fruit, hung heavy over the park, a silent testament to forgotten laughter and shattered dreams. This was Blackwood Park, a place swallowed by time and rumour, the perfect setting for Amy Sterling's latest film, a gothic reimagining of a classic tale.  She traced the faded paint on the swing's rusted seat, the rhythm of her breathing a counterpoint to the mournful creak of the swing set in the biting wind.  The first shot was going to be breathtaking.
