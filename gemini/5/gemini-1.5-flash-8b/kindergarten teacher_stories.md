The chipped paint on the jungle gym, a faded emerald green, reflected the harsh afternoon sun beating down on Miss Amelia Hawthorne's tiny, sun-drenched classroom.  Dust motes danced in the golden light filtering through the grimy windows, illuminating a chaos of colourful drawings, half-eaten snacks, and discarded blocks.  Amelia, a woman whose auburn hair was perpetually a tangled nest of sunshine and sweat, sighed, pushing a stray crayon from beneath a pile of construction paper.  Today's lesson was supposed to be about colours, but the boisterous energy of her five-year-old charges had spiralled into an impromptu exploration of the school's hidden nooks and crannies.  She knew, with the familiar ache of a mother bear protecting her cubs, that no matter how many times she explained the importance of staying in designated zones, this exuberant, imaginative freedom was an intrinsic part of their learning.  This was her third year at Sunnyside Elementary, a school perpetually clinging to the edges of neglect, yet blooming with a unique kind of resilience â€“ a resilience that mirrored the children in her classroom.
