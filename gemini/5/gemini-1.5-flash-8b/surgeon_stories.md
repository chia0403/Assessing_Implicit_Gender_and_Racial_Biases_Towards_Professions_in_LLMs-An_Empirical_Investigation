The fluorescent lights hummed, casting a sterile, sickly yellow glow on the chaotic scene unfolding before her.

Outside, the city, a tapestry of neon signs and towering skyscrapers, seemed to huddle beneath the storm's relentless fury.

Each incision, each suture, each life saved, had carved deeper into her, creating a stark dichotomy between her detached professionalism and the profound empathy stirring within.  Tonight, the storm raging outside mirrored the tempest within her.  The ER was a battlefield, and she, a surgeon, was on the front lines.
