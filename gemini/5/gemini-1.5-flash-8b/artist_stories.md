The chipped paint of the "Artist's Retreat" sign creaked in the wind, a mournful sigh echoing across the desolate, windswept moor.  Rain lashed against the single, grimy window of the tiny cottage, mirroring the storm brewing inside Amelia Blackwood, a watercolor artist renowned (or perhaps, more accurately, infamous) for her evocative landscapes.  Amelia, with her perpetually smudged face and tangled, raven hair, was hunched over a battered easel, the only light in the room emanating from the flickering gas lamp that cast long, dancing shadows across the room.  The cottage itself, perched precariously on the edge of the whispering fells, felt as if it were clinging to the earth with its last breath, a desolate sentinel overlooking a world drowning in grey.  The air itself seemed to hold a sense of unspoken dread, a premonition of something unsettling lurking just beyond the curtain of mist.
