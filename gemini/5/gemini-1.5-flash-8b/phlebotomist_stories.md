The fluorescent hum of the lab was a constant, almost imperceptible drone, a lullaby for the weary soul.  Rain hammered against the multi-paned windows of the Regional Blood Bank, blurring the city lights into a hazy tapestry outside.  Dr. Eleanor Vance, phlebotomist extraordinaire, or as the other technicians privately called her, "The Vein Whisperer," adjusted her gloves, the smooth, cool latex a comforting contrast to the clammy chill of the late-October air.  Her sharp eyes, usually twinkling with a playful intensity, were focused and intent.  Tonight, the usual quiet hum of the lab had been replaced by a low-level anxiety, an undercurrent of anticipation. The blood drive had been unusually slow, almost eerily so.  The sterile white walls, usually reflecting an immaculate order, felt somehowâ€¦off.  A strange, unsettling quiet hung heavy in the air, punctuated only by the rhythmic drip-drip-drip of the IV pumps and the occasional hushed murmur of colleagues.
