Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the "Whispering Pines Veterinary Clinic," a name Dr. Eleanor Vance found ironic given the incessant howling wind that often seemed to echo through the skeletal branches of the surrounding pines.  The clinic, perched precariously on a windswept hill overlooking the sprawling valley of the Copper Creek, was a small, one-room structure, more shack than clinic.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom.  Eleanor, her face streaked with grime and illuminated by the flickering fluorescent light, knelt beside a trembling,  whimpering fawn.  Its velvety fur was matted with mud, its large, frightened eyes reflecting the turmoil within.  The air, thick with the earthy smell of damp earth and the metallic tang of blood, hung heavy. This was her second emergency call in as many days, and the valley, notorious for its unpredictable weather patterns, was about to throw another curveball.
