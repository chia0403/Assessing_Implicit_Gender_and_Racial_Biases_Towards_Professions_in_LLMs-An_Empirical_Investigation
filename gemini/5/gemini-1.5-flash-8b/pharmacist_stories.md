The fluorescent hum of the pharmacy, a low thrumming counterpoint to the insistent clatter of the self-checkout machines outside, was Amelia Blackwood’s constant companion.  The scent of antiseptic, oddly mingled with the faint sweetness of vanilla-scented hand lotion, hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume of modern life. Amelia, a pharmacist with precisely sculpted auburn hair pulled back in a severe bun, hunched over a meticulously organized display of cough syrups and blister packs.  Each bottle, each box, held a silent story – a cold, a flu, a nagging pain – whispered tales of human frailty that Amelia absorbed unconsciously, the knowledge woven into the very fabric of her days.

Her pharmacy, “Apothecary's Remedy,” wasn't a bustling place.  Located on a quiet side street of the rapidly gentrifying district of Oakhaven, it felt a little like a forgotten relic.  Brick walls, stained with the ghosts of previous businesses, housed shelves overflowing with forgotten remedies and the slightly unsettling promise of cures long lost.  Vintage apothecary jars, their labels faded with time, lined the back wall, and old, leather-bound medical texts, stacked haphazardly on a mahogany cabinet, hinted at the store's rich history.  The faintest echo of other voices, other lives, faded in and out amongst the steady, rhythmic beep of the refrigerator humming its quiet tune.  It was a quiet place, a sanctuary for the quiet.  But Amelia knew, somehow, that tonight things were about to change.
