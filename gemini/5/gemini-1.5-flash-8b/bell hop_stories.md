The brass bell above the door of the Grand Imperial Hotel jingled a mournful tune, a counterpoint to the insistent drumming of rain against the oriel windows.  Rain lashed against the ornate facade, turning the already shadowy alleyways into treacherous, glistening rivers.  Inside, amidst the opulent gloom of the grand ballroom, a single flickering chandelier cast long, dancing shadows.  Elias Thorne, bellhop extraordinaire (or, at least, that was what he told himself), stood amidst the swirling chaos of arriving guests, a small, slightly hunched figure trying to navigate the flood of dripping umbrellas and hurried footsteps.  His tweed jacket, normally crisp and neatly pressed, was now clinging to him, damp and heavy.  The smell of wet wool and expensive perfume hung thick in the air.
