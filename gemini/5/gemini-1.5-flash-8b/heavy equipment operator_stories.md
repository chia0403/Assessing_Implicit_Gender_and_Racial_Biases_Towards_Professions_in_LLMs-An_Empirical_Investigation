The crimson sun bled across the cracked earth of the Arizona desert, painting the jagged peaks of the Superstition Mountains in hues of fire and ash.  Dust devils danced like miniature tornadoes, swirling around Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez's oversized Caterpillar 336, its massive tracks churning a deep furrow into the already parched landscape.  The year was 2042, and the once-thriving copper mine, now a desolate scar on the land, was Amy's domain.  She was a Heavy Equipment Operator, specializing in salvage and reclamation, and today's task was more than just clearing debris; it was uncovering a mystery.

Amy, a woman whose face, weathered and sun-baked, bore the quiet strength of granite, adjusted the helmet visor, the faint hum of the engine a constant companion. The wind whispered secrets across the silent expanse, carrying the metallic tang of oxidation and the faint, metallic scent of something else… something unnatural.  A low growl, like a wounded beast, emanated from beneath the earth, a sound that resonated deep within Amy’s bones, pulling her into a hidden, unsettling stillness.  The mine was known for its forgotten tunnels, its tales of ghosts and lost treasures, but this… this felt different. It felt... ominous.
