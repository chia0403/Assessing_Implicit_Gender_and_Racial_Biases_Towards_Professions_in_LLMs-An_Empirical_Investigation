The biting wind, a relentless whisper of the Arctic, clawed at Sergeant Anya Petrova's exposed cheeks.  The flickering light of the outpost's single lamp cast long, dancing shadows across the snow-dusted landscape.  Each gust brought with it a chilling reminder of the vast, unforgiving expanse that stretched for miles in every direction, a silent, frozen ocean waiting to swallow the unwary.  The outpost, a squat, weathered structure of steel and reinforced concrete, stood sentinel against the encroaching darkness, a lonely outpost on the remote, ice-locked shore of the Kolyma River.  Anya, Sergeant Anya Petrova, her breath misting in the frigid air, adjusted the worn leather straps of her parka, the rough wool a small comfort against the relentless cold.  Her breath caught in her throat as she heard itâ€”a faint, almost imperceptible scraping sound, emanating from the deserted section of the perimeter fence.  The stillness before the storm, always a dangerous thing.
