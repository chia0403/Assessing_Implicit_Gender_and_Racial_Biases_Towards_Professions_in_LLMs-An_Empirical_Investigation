The flickering fluorescent hum of the abandoned warehouse vibrated through Bartholomew "Barty"  Fitzwilliam's boots. Dust motes, illuminated by the single, sputtering sodium vapor lamp, danced in the air, painting ethereal patterns on the chipped concrete floor.  Rain hammered against the corrugated metal roof, a relentless percussion that echoed through the cavernous space.  Barty, a seasoned electrician with calloused hands and eyes that held the wisdom of a thousand frayed wires, swore under his breath, the sound swallowed by the oppressive silence punctuated only by the rhythmic drumming.  He was alone, deep within the bowels of the forgotten "Phoenix Industries," a place swallowed by the creeping ivy and the gnawing rust of neglect.  His meticulously-drawn blueprints, tucked into a worn leather satchel, felt almost comforting in his calloused grasp.  This was no ordinary job.  This was an excavation, a perilous journey into the heart of a mystery.  His task: to trace the origin of a series of strange electrical anomalies, an eerie pulse that only he could hear, whispering through the empty corridors.
