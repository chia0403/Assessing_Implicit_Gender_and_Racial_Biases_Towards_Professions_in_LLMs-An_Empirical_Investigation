The scent of honeysuckle, almost cloying in its sweetness, clung to the air outside Amelia Nightingale's tiny shop, "Blooms by the Bay."  Sunlight, filtered through the leaves of the ancient oak shading the front stoop, painted shifting patterns of gold and emerald on the meticulously arranged bouquets lining the window.  Amelia, a woman whose hands, despite their delicate touch, bore the calluses of a lifetime spent coaxing life from wilting stems, hummed a low tune as she arranged a cluster of pansies, their deep violet eyes reflecting the fading afternoon light.  The rhythmic click of her scissors echoed in the quiet street, a counterpoint to the gentle lapping of the waves against the nearby pier.  The sea air, carrying the salty tang of the Pacific, mingled with the floral perfume, creating a heady, almost magical atmosphere.  This was her sanctuary, the only place where the ceaseless demands of the world seemed to soften into a gentle murmur.
