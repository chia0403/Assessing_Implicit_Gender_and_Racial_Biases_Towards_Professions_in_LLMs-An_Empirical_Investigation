The biting wind whipped Amelia Nightingale's scarf around her face, stinging her cheeks with icy particles.  Below, the sprawling, snow-dusted expanse of the Matterhorn’s glacial crevasses stretched out like a canvas painted with the greys and whites of a forgotten winter.  High above, the jagged peaks, sculpted by millennia of ice and rock, pierced the bruised purple sky, their silent grandeur a stark contrast to the frantic energy humming within Amelia.  She clutched her worn leather journal, its pages filled with the stories she poured out for her tourists.  Today, however, only the mournful cry of a lone raven echoed through the alpine air.  Amelia,  a renowned but perpetually anxious tour guide for the exclusive Alpine Explorers Society, felt a tremor of premonition – a shiver deeper than the mountain air.  This tour, scheduled to traverse the treacherous Khumbu Glacier, was already off to a disquieting start.  Her group, composed of meticulously-chosen wealthy investors and intrepid mountaineers,  were already showing their characteristic impatience and demanding their usual personalized tours.  Amelia knew the mountain held secrets, whispered promises and chilling warnings – and she had a feeling this trip might be more than just a picturesque hike into the Himalayas.
