The chipped paint on the wrought-iron gates of Blackwood Manor creaked a mournful symphony in the pre-dawn chill.  Dew clung to the emerald lawns, mirroring the glistening tears clinging to the worn, denim jacket of Bartholomew "Barty" Finch, groundskeeper for the sprawling estate.  The manor itself, a gothic behemoth of grey stone, loomed against the bruised purple sky, its many windows like vacant eyes staring out at the awakening world.  Barty shivered, not just from the damp air, but from a growing unease that had settled in his gut like a lead weight.  He'd been expecting a problem, a particularly stubborn weed or a broken sprinkler head, but this…this felt different. This felt ominous.  He adjusted the worn leather strap of his tool bag, the familiar weight a small comfort in the unsettling silence.

The Blackwood estate was steeped in history, whispered legends, and a certain… eeriness.  Ivy choked the crumbling stone walls, its tendrils reaching out like grasping fingers.  Ancient trees, their gnarled branches like skeletal arms, reached towards the sky, casting long, dancing shadows across the meticulously manicured lawns.  The air itself seemed to hold a suppressed hum, a constant thrumming that vibrated through the earth, a subtle counterpoint to the quiet rustle of leaves.  Every corner of the estate hinted at a past that refused to remain buried.  Barty, a man accustomed to the rhythmic symphony of nature, found himself listening now to a different kind of music, a much more unsettling one.
