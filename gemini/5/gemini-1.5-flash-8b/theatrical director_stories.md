His latest production, a bold reimagining of Shakespeare's "The Tempest," had been abruptly cancelled due to, as the papers had put it, "unforeseen circumstances."  Those circumstances, Alistair knew, were far more complicated than any financial crisis or artistic disagreement. They were tied to a deeper, more personal struggle, a secret he guarded as fiercely as the final act of a masterpiece.
