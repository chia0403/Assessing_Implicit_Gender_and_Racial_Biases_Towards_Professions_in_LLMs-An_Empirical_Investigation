The chipped Formica countertop gleamed under the fluorescent hum of the office, reflecting the dust motes dancing in the single shaft of afternoon sun piercing the grime-coated window.  Rain lashed against the glass, a relentless percussion that mirrored the steady rhythmic click-clack of Amelia Blackwood's fingers on the keyboard.  Amelia, a bookkeeper with a precise, almost clinical, approach to numbers, found solace in the predictable symphony of her work.  Rows of figures, meticulously recorded, were her sanctuary from the chaotic world outside.

Ameliaâ€™s office, tucked away on the third floor of a dilapidated building on the edge of the city, was a testament to decades of neglect.  The faded, floral wallpaper clung to the walls like a wilting shroud, and the air, thick with the scent of old paper and stale coffee, hung heavy with the unspoken history of the building.  The only personal touch was a framed print of a lone, stoic oak tree, its gnarled branches stretching towards a perpetually overcast sky. This small touch, Amelia suspected, was the only other constant in her life besides the incessant drumming of her fingers.  Outside, the storm raged, but within the sterile confines of her office, the only tempest was the quiet, internal one she knew she'd have to navigate after closing for the evening.
