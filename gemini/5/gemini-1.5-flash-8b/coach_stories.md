Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the dilapidated community centre, a soundtrack to the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Amelia "Ash"  Ashworth's heart.  The air hung thick with the smell of damp earth and something faintly metallic, a scent Ash recognized all too well from the nearby scrapyard.  Tonight, the scent mixed with the acrid tang of fear.  Her basketball team, the "Renegades," a ragtag bunch of underprivileged kids from the sprawling slums surrounding the city, were hours late.  Ash, a woman carved from granite and tempered by years of dealing with heartache and hardship,  stared out at the relentless downpour, her weathered face illuminated by the flickering fluorescent lights.  The silence, broken only by the drumming rain, felt heavy, pregnant with unspoken anxieties.

The community centre, a relic of a bygone era, stood isolated on a forgotten corner of the city.  Its walls, once vibrant, were now faded and peeling, mirroring the lives of the youth it housed.  Broken windows stared blankly out at the encroaching gloom, punctuated by the occasional flicker of a candlelight in a nearby tenement window.  A scattering of discarded basketballs and worn-out sneakers lay scattered across the cracked asphalt floor, remnants of countless practices and games fought under different circumstances.  The air, always damp and heavy, vibrated with an unsettling quiet.
