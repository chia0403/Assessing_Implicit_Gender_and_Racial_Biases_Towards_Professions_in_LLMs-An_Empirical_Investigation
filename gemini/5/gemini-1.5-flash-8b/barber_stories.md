The chipped porcelain sink, stained a sickly yellow from years of lukewarm water and forgotten soaps, reflected the flickering gaslight above Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's head.  Dust motes danced in the single beam of light, illuminating the intricate carvings on the ancient wooden barber's chair.  Barty, a man whose salt-and-pepper beard rivalled the age of the shop itself, meticulously sharpened his razor, the rhythmic clinking a counterpoint to the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of a distant carriage.  The scent of lavender and old mahogany clung to the air, a familiar comfort in the otherwise musty atmosphere of "The Golden Shears," a barbershop tucked away on a cobbled side street in the heart of 19th-century London.  Rain hammered against the grimy windowpanes, blurring the gaslight's glow and creating a symphony of rhythmic drumming against the stillness of the late-night hours.  A single, flickering candle on the counter cast long shadows across the shelves filled with forgotten combs and faded pomades, lending a touch of mystery to the usually bustling establishment.
