Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the Blackwood Insurance Agency, mimicking the relentless drumming in Elara Blackwood's temples.  The tiny office, crammed with overflowing file cabinets and the faint scent of stale coffee, felt like a pressure cooker on a humid summer afternoon.  Outside, the sprawling, neglected suburbs of Willow Creek sprawled under a bruised purple sky, a landscape of peeling paint and forgotten dreams.  Elara, a slender woman with eyes the color of storm clouds, hunched over a stack of claim forms, the fluorescent lights flickering above her like anxious, judgmental eyes.  Her name, Elara Blackwood, felt like a heavy cloak, a legacy of expectations she struggled to live up to.  She was a third-generation insurance agent, inheriting not only the agency but also the burden of its dwindling clientele and the reputation of being "the unlucky agent".  Every claim seemed to bring her a step closer to the precipice of failure. Today, however, the storm was brewing not just outside, but within.
