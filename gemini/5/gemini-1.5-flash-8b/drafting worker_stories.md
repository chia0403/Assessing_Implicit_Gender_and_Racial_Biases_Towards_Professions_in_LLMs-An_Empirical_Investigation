The fluorescent lights of the drafting room hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to the rhythmic scratching of pencils against paper.  Dust motes danced in the pale beams, illuminating the meticulous lines of blueprints stretching across drawing tables.  Elias Thorne, a drafting worker for the sprawling Blackwood Construction Company, hunched over his table, the faint smell of aged ink and sawdust clinging to the air.  His brow was furrowed in concentration, his lips pressed into a tight line as he wrestled with the intricate details of a new skyscraper, its steel and glass envisioned on the page before him.  The relentless hum of the ventilation system, a constant, low drone, only heightened the quiet intensity of the room.

The drafting room, located on the third floor of Blackwood's sprawling headquarters, was a cavernous space, filled with the silent, focused energy of dozens of workers like Elias.  Long, polished tables, each equipped with a drafting board, a set of compasses, and a plethora of technical instruments, lined the walls.  The air, thick with the promise of construction and the subtle metallic tang of the tools, held a quiet, almost tangible anticipation of the towering buildings that would soon rise from the ground, a testament to the work unfolding before them.  Windows on the far wall offered a glimpse of the city, a tapestry of brick and mortar stretching towards the horizon, a backdrop to the detailed, precise work Elias dedicated himself to each day.
