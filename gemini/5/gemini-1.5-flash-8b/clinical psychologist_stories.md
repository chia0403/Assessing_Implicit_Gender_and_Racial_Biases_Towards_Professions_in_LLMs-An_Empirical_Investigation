Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Dr. Eleanor Vance's clinic, a rhythmic drumming that mirrored the frantic thoughts swirling in her head.  The small, cluttered office, tucked away on a side street in the perpetually overcast city of Alderhaven, smelled faintly of stale coffee and anxiety.  Bookshelves crammed with professional texts towered over her, their spines a testament to the countless hours she'd spent poring over case studies, decoding the labyrinthine pathways of the human mind.  A single, almost pathetically cheerful, sunflower in a chipped ceramic vase sat on her cluttered desk, a stark contrast to the stormy grey outside.  The phone, perpetually humming with the low thrum of unanswered calls, was the only other sound besides the rain, a constant reminder of the clients waiting, their struggles mirroring the relentless downpour.  Today, though, felt different.  It felt... heavier.
