The flickering neon sign of the "Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow on Amelia Rose Blackwood's face, highlighting the faintest of freckles scattered across her nose.  Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless percussion that echoed the frantic rhythm of her heart.  Tonight, the Rusty Mug was a maelstrom of boisterous laughter, clinking glasses, and the low hum of conversation, but Amelia felt utterly alone.  She was a small speck of a person in a vast, chaotic room, a server navigating a sea of hungry, impatient customers, each a miniature storm threatening to swallow her whole.


The Rusty Mug wasn't glamorous.  Built of weathered wood and patched-up metal, the establishment was a relic from a bygone era, its rustic charm masking a history as worn and chipped as the paint on its walls.  Dim, flickering gas lamps cast long shadows over the crowded tables, illuminating the dust motes dancing in the air.  The scent of frying onions and stale beer hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to the regulars who frequented the place, but a suffocating aroma to Amelia, who longed for a breath of fresh air and a night where her hands didn't feel like raw hamburger.
