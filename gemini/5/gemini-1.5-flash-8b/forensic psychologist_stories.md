The flickering fluorescent lights of the interrogation room hummed, a counterpoint to the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Dr. Eleanor Vance's heart.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom, illuminating the stark white walls and the tense figure slumped in the chair opposite her.  It was a familiar, if not always comfortable, setting.  Forensics, after all, dealt with the uncomfortable and often the unspeakable.

The room itself, located deep within the bowels of the Metropolitan Police Department's forensic unit, was sterile and functional.  Steel-grey walls, polished to a mirror-like sheen, reflected the worried expressions on the faces of the detectives flanking the suspect.  A stale odor of antiseptic and despair hung heavy in the air, a scent Dr. Vance had come to recognize as the perfume of a crime scene.  Her own trench coat, a familiar companion in such places, felt heavy against her shoulders, a weight mirroring the gravity of the case.

The suspect, a young man named Liam O'Connell, sat hunched over, his eyes fixed on the worn linoleum floor.  His hands were clasped tightly in his lap, fingers intertwined like the frail branches of a withered tree.  This case, the brutal murder of a renowned art historian, felt different though.  The victim's meticulously curated life contrasted sharply with the suspect's apparent emptiness, a void that had both captivated and unnerved Dr. Vance.  The challenge before her, as always, was to find the truth buried beneath the layers of lies and fear.
