The flickering neon sign of the "Sunrise Express" cast a sickly yellow glow on Amelia Hawthorne's face as she meticulously arranged the miniature, complimentary toiletries.  Her fingers, swift and precise, moved across the velvet-lined tray, a dancer performing a silent ballet.

Outside, the vast expanse of the Chugach Mountains, jagged peaks piercing the bruised indigo sky, stretched to the horizon, a canvas painted with the promise and peril of the untamed north. Amelia, a flight attendant for the ruggedly beautiful, if somewhat perilous, Alaska Skyways, knew this route intimately.  The journey, from Anchorage to Fairbanks, was a microcosm of the untamed spirit that pulsed through the land itself, a spirit she often felt tugging at her own restless heart.
