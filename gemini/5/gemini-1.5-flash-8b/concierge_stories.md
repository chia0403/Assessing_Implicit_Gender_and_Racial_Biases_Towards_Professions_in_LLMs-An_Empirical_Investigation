The flickering neon sign of the Grand Zenith Hotel cast a lurid, emerald glow on Amelia Petrova's meticulously polished shoes.  Rain, a relentless curtain of grey, hammered against the double-paned windows of the lobby, obscuring the city skyline in a swirling mist.  Amelia, a concierge with a smile as sharp and precise as a finely honed blade, surveyed the hushed, almost empty space.  Only a lone figure, hunched in a leather armchair near the fireplace, seemed to pierce the gloom.  He was a man of indeterminate age, wrapped in a heavy overcoat, his face hidden in shadow.  A single, ornate briefcase sat beside him, its brass clasp gleaming faintly.

The Grand Zenith, a relic of a bygone era of opulent travel, stood on a hill overlooking the sprawling metropolis of Aethelgard.  Its towering architecture, a symphony of sculpted stone and intricate ironwork, seemed to defy the relentless downpour.  Inside, however, the vast lobby, once a hub of vibrant activity, was unusually quiet.  The scent of old leather, mingled with the faint perfume of lilies and the damp earth of the approaching storm, hung heavy in the air.  A hush, heavier than the rain, settled over the guests and the staff, a palpable sense of anticipation hanging in the air. Tonight, the silence felt pregnant with secrets.
