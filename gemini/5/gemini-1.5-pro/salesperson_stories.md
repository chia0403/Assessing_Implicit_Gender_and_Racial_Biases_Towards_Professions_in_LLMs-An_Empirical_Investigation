Rain lashed against the windows of the "Coffee Stop" diner, blurring the neon "Open" sign into a hazy glow.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and burnt bacon.  Eleanor Vance, a travelling saleswoman for "Prestige Paper Products," hunched over a chipped mug, its lukewarm contents doing little to combat the chill that seeped through her damp trench coat.  Her sample case, battered and scuffed from countless miles on the road, sat at her feet. Outside, the desolate highway stretched across the Nevada desert, vanishing into the stormy twilight.  Harmony Springs, population 384, wasn't exactly a bustling metropolis, and Eleanor was beginning to regret taking the detour.  She had been aiming for Las Vegas, but a flash flood warning had diverted her onto this lonely, forgotten back road, and now she was stuck, praying for the rain to stop and a miracle client to walk through the diner door.
