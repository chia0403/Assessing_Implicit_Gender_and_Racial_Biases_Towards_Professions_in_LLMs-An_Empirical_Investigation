The biting February wind whipped across the Brooklyn rooftop, plastering Amelia “Amy” Reyes’s dark hair against her cheek.  Below, the cityscape glittered, a million pinpricks of light against the inky velvet of the night.  Amy, bundled in a worn leather jacket several sizes too big, ignored the spectacular view.  Her gaze, sharp and critical, was fixed on the monitor displaying the scene they'd just shot.  The actors, huddled together for warmth beneath a flimsy awning down on the street, looked convincingly miserable, which was precisely what Amy wanted. This scene, the climax of her indie thriller, "The Clockwork Heart," had to be perfect. It hinged on the raw, desperate energy of two people trapped, both physically and emotionally, with the relentless ticking clock of a killer's deadline echoing in their every breath.  The budget was shoestring, the schedule punishing, and the lead actress notoriously difficult, but Amy, with the relentless focus of a seasoned general preparing for battle,  was determined to make this film the one that finally put her name in lights.
