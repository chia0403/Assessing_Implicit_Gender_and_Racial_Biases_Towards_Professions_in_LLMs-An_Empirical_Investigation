The velvet curtain, heavy with the dust of forgotten dramas and the ghosts of applause long faded, shivered slightly as Elias Thorne, his fingers stained nicotine yellow from a chain-smoked cigarette, peered through a tiny gap. The cavernous auditorium of the Grand Majestic Theatre, once the jewel of Sheridan Square, now breathed a stale air of neglect.  Moonlight, fractured by the grimy, arched windows high above, painted skeletal patterns on the rows of empty, plush-backed seats, each one a silent testament to the theatre’s bygone glory.  Dust motes, disturbed by Elias’s presence, danced in the silvery beams like spectral patrons attending a performance only they could see. The scent of mildew and the faint, metallic tang of old blood – a legacy from a prop mishap in a particularly enthusiastic staging of Macbeth decades prior – hung heavy in the stillness. Elias, his face etched with the weariness of a thousand opening nights and a hundred failed dreams, took a final drag of his cigarette before grinding it under his heel.  Tonight, in this echoing mausoleum of theatrical ambition, everything was riding on him.
