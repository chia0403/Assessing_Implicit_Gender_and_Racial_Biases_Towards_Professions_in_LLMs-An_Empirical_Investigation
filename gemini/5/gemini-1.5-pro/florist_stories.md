The bell above the door of "Petal & Stem" chimed a melancholic two-note tune as the first customer of the day entered. Rain hammered against the large window, blurring the view of the bustling Seattle waterfront beyond. Inside, amongst the fragrant chaos of buckets overflowing with hydrangeas, lilies, and roses, Elias Thorne meticulously arranged a spray of vibrant sunflowers. His hands, calloused yet deft, moved with practiced grace, each stem placed with thoughtful precision.  He preferred the solitude of the early mornings, before the shop filled with the murmur of conversations and the scent of a hundred different blooms vying for attention.  It was in these quiet hours that Elias truly felt at home, surrounded by the silent language of flowers, each petal a whispered promise of life, death, and rebirth. The air, thick with the perfume of damp earth and cut stems, held a different kind of magic before the city fully awoke.
