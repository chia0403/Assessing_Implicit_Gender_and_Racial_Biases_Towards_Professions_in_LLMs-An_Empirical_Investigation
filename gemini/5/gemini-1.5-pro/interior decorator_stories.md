The biting November wind whipped around Eleanor Vance as she wrestled a recalcitrant sample case out of her vintage Porsche, its cherry-red paint gleaming against the backdrop of the greystone mansion looming before her.  Wysteria Manor, the whispered name echoed in her mind, a place of local legend and faded grandeur.  Situated on a windswept bluff overlooking the churning grey waters of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, the house seemed to hunch against the elements, its many windows like dark, watchful eyes.  Eleanor, bundled in a cashmere scarf and a tailored wool coat the colour of burnt umber, tugged her leather gloves tighter, a shiver not entirely due to the cold running down her spine.  This wasn't just any commission; this was the Vance Design Agencyâ€™s chance to finally break into the notoriously exclusive world of old Seattle money. Restoring Wysteria Manor to its former glory would be a career-defining moment, and Eleanor, despite the unsettling atmosphere of the place, was determined to make it a masterpiece.
