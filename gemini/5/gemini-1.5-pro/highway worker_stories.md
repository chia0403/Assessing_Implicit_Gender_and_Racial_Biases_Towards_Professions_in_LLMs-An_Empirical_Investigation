The biting wind whipped across the desolate expanse of Highway 17, carrying the scent of pine and the low drone of eighteen-wheelers barreling towards the horizon.  The sky, a bruised purple, threatened snow.  Elias Vance, bundled in layers of fluorescent orange against the encroaching dusk, tightened the grip on his shovel, the worn metal cold against his gloved hand.  A rogue tumbleweed, caught in a gust, skittered across the cracked asphalt, a lonely traveler on a road stretching into the vast emptiness of the Nevada desert.  Elias watched it go, a flicker of amusement in his otherwise weary eyes.  Another shift, another stretch of endless highway, another day closer to... well, he wasn't quite sure what.  But the setting sun painted the distant mountains in hues of fire and shadow, a breathtaking spectacle even Elias, after years of witnessing it, couldn't ignore. This particular evening, however, the beauty held an edge of unease.  Something felt different.  The air was too still, the silence too deep, broken only by the occasional mournful cry of a distant coyote.
