The rusty tang of iron oxide hung heavy in the air, mingling with the sweet scent of honeysuckle that stubbornly snaked its way through the chain-link fence surrounding Rosie's Auto Repair.  The late afternoon sun, a hazy orange orb sinking towards the horizon, cast long shadows across the gravel yard, illuminating the skeletal remains of a '57 Chevy pickup and a clutch of other vehicles in varying states of disrepair. Inside the corrugated iron workshop, illuminated by a single bare bulb dangling precariously from the rafters,  Eleanor "Ellie" Vance, her hands smudged with grease and her dark hair pulled back in a messy bun, wrestled with the stubborn lug nuts of a Ford F-150.  Sweat beaded on her forehead as she grunted with the effort, the wrench slipping in her oil-slicked grip.  Dust motes danced in the single beam of light that sliced through the gloom, revealing a workspace cluttered with tools, spare parts, and half-finished projects. Outside, the only sound was the mournful cry of a train whistle in the distance, a lonely sound that echoed the feeling of isolation that often settled over Ellie in the quiet hours between jobs.
