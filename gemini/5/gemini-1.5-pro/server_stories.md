The flickering neon sign of the Starlight Diner cast a greasy, iridescent glow across the rain-slicked asphalt of Bleecker Street.  Inside, Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez wiped down the counter with a practiced hand, the scent of stale coffee and frying onions clinging to her like a second skin.  It was 2:17 am, the graveyard shift was dragging its heels towards dawn, and the Starlight, usually buzzing with late-night chatter and the clatter of cutlery, was eerily quiet. The only other occupants were a lone truck driver nursing a mug of black coffee in the corner booth, and a stray ginger cat curled up asleep on one of the red vinyl bar stools. Rain lashed against the large front windows, each drop a staccato note in the symphony of the city that never sleeps, but tonight, felt strangely subdued, holding its breath for something unknown.
