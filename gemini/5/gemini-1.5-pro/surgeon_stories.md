The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne as he ascended the steps of the imposing Greystone Manor Sanatorium.  Nestled high in the Adirondack Mountains of upstate New York, the sanatorium loomed against the bruised twilight sky like a gothic fortress.  Its weathered stone walls, punctuated by narrow, arched windows, seemed to absorb the last vestiges of daylight, exuding an air of both grandeur and decay.  Elias tugged his collar higher, the crisp air doing little to dispel the gnawing unease that had settled in his stomach during the long, winding drive from Albany. He clutched his worn leather bag, its contents – a meticulously curated set of surgical instruments – a familiar weight against his thigh.  He’d been summoned urgently, the telegram cryptic but insistent, speaking of a unique case, a delicate procedure. The only other details offered were the patient’s name – a Mr. Silas Blackwood – and a stark warning: time was of the essence.
