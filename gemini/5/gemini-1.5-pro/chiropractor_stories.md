The neon "Open" sign buzzed erratically, casting a sickly yellow glow across the rain-slicked asphalt of Elm Street. Inside, Dr. Elias Thorne, D.C., adjusted the thermostat for the third time in an hour. The damp chill of late October had seeped into the bones of his small practice, Thorne Chiropractic, clinging to the air like a persistent patient with a stubborn lower back. Elias, a man whose own posture was a testament to his profession, sighed and ran a hand through his close-cropped, greying hair. He’d been in the small town of Havenwood, nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, for five years, long enough for the creaks in the floorboards to become familiar, but not long enough to shake the feeling that he was still an outsider.  The bell above the door chimed, announcing a visitor, and Elias plastered a welcoming smile on his face, hoping it was a patient and not another bill collector.  Havenwood was picturesque, certainly, but its beauty hid a struggling economy and a dwindling population – a combination that wasn't exactly kind to a small business.
