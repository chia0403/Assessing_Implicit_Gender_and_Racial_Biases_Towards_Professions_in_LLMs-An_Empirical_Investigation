The relentless London drizzle seemed to mirror the grey mood settling over Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne.  Her flat, nestled above a perpetually fragrant Indian takeaway on Brick Lane, usually vibrated with the eclectic energy of the East End. Tonight, however, the rhythmic thump of the bass from the nearby clubs only amplified the hollowness within her.  Rain lashed against the large, grime-streaked window that served as her primary light source, reflecting the glow of her MacBook screen back onto her tired face. Deadlines loomed – a rebrand for a craft brewery, illustrations for a children’s book, and the ever-present, soul-crushing pitch deck for a potential new client.  Amy, usually a whirlwind of creative energy, felt stifled, trapped in a loop of Pantone swatches and kerning adjustments.  The vibrant murals that adorned the brick walls outside her window mocked her with their untamed bursts of colour, a stark contrast to the sterile white of her current design brief.  Tonight, even her beloved collection of vintage Penguin paperbacks offered no solace.  Something had to change.
