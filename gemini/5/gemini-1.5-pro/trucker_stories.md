The cab of the Peterbilt 379, affectionately nicknamed "The Wanderer" by its owner, Elijah Vance Holloway, rumbled low like a contented metal beast.  Outside, the Nevada desert stretched in all directions, a tapestry woven with shimmering heat haze and the occasional, defiant Joshua tree. The sun, a molten eye low on the horizon, painted the sky in hues of bruised orange and fading violet. Elijah, his weathered face etched with lines carved by sun and long hours on the road, tapped a rhythm on the steering wheel along to Hank Williams Jr. crackling from the radio. Heâ€™d been hauling a load of pre-fabricated homes from Reno to Phoenix, a two-day run, and tonight he was aiming for a dusty truck stop just outside of Las Vegas, a beacon of lukewarm coffee and greasy burgers in the vast, unforgiving emptiness.  The desert, however, had other plans.  A flicker of movement in his side mirror, too fast to be a tumbleweed, caught his eye.  Elijah frowned, squinting into the growing dusk.
