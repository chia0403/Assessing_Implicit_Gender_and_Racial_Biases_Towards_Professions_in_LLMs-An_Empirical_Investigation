The fluorescent lights of St. Jude's Hospital Emergency Room hummed a relentless, sterile tune. Rain lashed against the windows, blurring the already muted city lights of Philadelphia. Inside, the air crackled with a different kind of energy â€“ the frenetic, controlled chaos that only a busy ER could generate. Amidst the controlled pandemonium, Amelia Grace Holloway, RN, adjusted the nasal cannula on a pale, elderly woman complaining of shortness of breath, her fingers moving with practiced efficiency.  The pungent scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, mingled with the subtler, more human smells of fear and sweat.  Amelia glanced at the clock: 11:58 PM. Two more minutes and her shift would be over, but if experience had taught her anything, it was that the last two minutes of a shift in the ER could often be the longest.
