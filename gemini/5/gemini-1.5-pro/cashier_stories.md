The fluorescent lights of the Quick Stop hummed a monotonous B flat above Amelia Reyes, their sickly glow reflecting off the linoleum floor, polished to a sheen by countless scuffed shoes. Outside, the late October wind whipped fallen leaves into miniature tornadoes along the cracked asphalt of the Route 66 rest stop.  Amelia, her name tag pinned slightly askew on her faded blue uniform, tapped a chipped, cherry-red nail against the worn countertop.  It was 11:57 pm, three minutes until her shift ended and she could escape the stale smell of hot dogs and desperation that permeated the tiny convenience store.  The bell above the door chimed, its shrill announcement breaking the oppressive silence, and Amelia plastered a weary smile on her face.  “Welcome to Quick Stop,” she recited, the words tasting like ash in her mouth.  She hoped it wasn’t another trucker looking for lukewarm coffee and a rambling conversation.
