The flickering fluorescent lights of the Zenith BioTech research wing buzzed like trapped wasps, casting long, skeletal shadows of Elias Thorne across the polished linoleum. It was 2:17 AM, a time Elias considered the sweet spot of his shift – past the researchers’ late-night caffeine-fueled breakthroughs, yet before the bleary-eyed arrival of the early morning cleaning crew. Zenith BioTech, a gleaming obelisk of glass and steel piercing the Boston skyline, was a place of scientific miracles by day. By night, it was Elias’s domain, a silent kingdom of empty labs, echoing hallways, and the faint, chemical tang of unrealized futures.  He pushed his mop bucket across the floor, the squeaky wheels a lonely counterpoint to the hum of the ventilation system. Tonight, however, a different sound pricked his ears – a rhythmic, almost melodic clicking, emanating from Lab 42, a restricted area even for him.
