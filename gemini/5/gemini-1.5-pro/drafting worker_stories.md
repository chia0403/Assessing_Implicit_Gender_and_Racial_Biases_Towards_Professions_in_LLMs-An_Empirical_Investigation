The flickering fluorescent lights of the D&M Architectural firm hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Reyes' life.  It was a Thursday in late October, and a damp chill clung to the air in Buffalo, New York, seeping through the poorly insulated windows of the converted warehouse. Amelia, her dark hair pulled back in a practical ponytail, hunched over her drafting table, the cool metal pressing against her forearms.  Around her, the large, open-plan space buzzed with the low murmur of conversations, the rhythmic tapping of keyboards, and the whir of the large-format printer in the corner.  The air smelled faintly of blueprint ink, stale coffee, and the lingering scent of someone’s microwaved fish from lunchtime. Outside, the wind howled, rattling the corrugated iron siding, a sound that mirrored the growing anxiety in Amelia’s chest. This new project, the renovation of the historic Lafayette Hotel, was her biggest yet, and the deadline loomed like a storm cloud on the horizon.
