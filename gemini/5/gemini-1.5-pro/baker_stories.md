The aroma of cardamom and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the pre-dawn chill.  Amelia "Millie" Blackwood, her flour-dusted apron tied tight around her waist, squinted at the oven clock in the flickering gaslight. 4:17 am. Just like every other morning for the past twelve years, Millie was the first soul awake in the sleepy seaside town of Port Blossom, Maine.  Her bakery, "The Salty Tart," nestled between a dusty antique shop and a perpetually closed fishmonger's, was her sanctuary, a warm, yeasty haven filled with the ghosts of her grandmother's recipes and the promise of a new day. Outside, the only sound was the rhythmic lapping of the waves against the harbor wall, a gentle lullaby to the rising loaves in Millie's oven.  But this morning, something was different.  A faint, metallic scent mingled with the sweet perfume of baking bread, and a single, crimson stain bloomed on the pristine white doorstep like a malevolent poppy.
