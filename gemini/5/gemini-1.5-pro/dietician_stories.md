The fluorescent lights of the Healthy Habits Nutrition Clinic hummed a monotonous tune, occasionally punctuated by the whirring of the ancient blender Amelia Reyes used for client demonstrations. Rain lashed against the large window overlooking Main Street, blurring the neon glow of the Pho King restaurant across the street. Amelia, full name Amelia Sofia Reyes, tapped a pen against her cluttered desk, its surface littered with patient files, half-eaten granola bars (for "research purposes," she’d claim), and a stack of dog-eared nutrition journals. The small town of Harmony Creek, Oregon, was nestled deep within the Willamette Valley, a place known more for its craft breweries and sprawling vineyards than its health-conscious residents.  This often left Amelia feeling like a salmon swimming upstream, trying to instill healthy habits in a population seemingly addicted to carbs and Pinot Noir. This Tuesday morning, however, felt particularly challenging. Not only was the weather conspiring to keep her clients at home, but a strange email had landed in her inbox, promising to change the course of her career – and perhaps, her life.
