The revolving doors of the Grand Majestic Hotel whispered a sigh of cool, conditioned air onto the sweltering July streets of New Orleans.  Inside, beneath the glittering chandelier that cascaded down three stories like frozen fireworks,  Fitzwilliam "Fitz" Audubon, Jr. straightened his pillbox hat and adjusted the brass buttons on his crisp crimson uniform. The lobby, a symphony of polished marble and plush velvet, buzzed with the low murmur of affluent guests and the clinking of ice in crystal glasses.  Fitz, all of nineteen years old and with a smile that could charm the birds from the nearby Audubon Park (no relation, he always hastened to add), surveyed his domain. The heat outside might have been oppressive, but within the hallowed halls of the Grand Majestic, everything was perfectly in order, just waiting for the next guest to arrive and for Fitz to offer his signature brand of Southern hospitality.
