The biting wind whipped across the desolate expanse of the Alaskan tundra, stinging Rosalind "Rosie" Petrov's exposed cheeks despite the thick layer of Vaseline she'd slathered on.  The sky, a bruised purple tinged with the pale ghost of a setting sun, cast long, eerie shadows from the skeletal frames of oil rigs dotting the frozen landscape.  Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, in late November was a brutal mistress, unforgiving and relentless. Rosie, bundled in layers of thermal underwear, fleece, and a worn parka, expertly maneuvered her D11 dozer, its massive treads churning through the snow-covered permafrost. The rhythmic growl of the engine, a familiar lullaby in this desolate realm, was momentarily punctuated by the crackle of her radio. "Rosie, you read me?" a gruff voice barked.  "Got a problem down by pipeline marker 47. Looks like a section's buckled with the freeze.  Need you to get down there ASAP."  Rosie sighed, the plume of her breath visible even inside the heated cab. Another problem. Another long night. Just another day in the life of a heavy equipment operator at the top of the world.
