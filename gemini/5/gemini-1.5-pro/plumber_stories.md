The rusty wrench slipped in Elias Thorne's greasy hand, smacking against the corroded copper pipe with a dull thud.  A plume of stagnant water erupted, showering Elias in the fetid remnants of last week's casserole. He sighed, the smell mingling unpleasantly with the already thick aroma of mildew that permeated Mrs. Gable's basement.  Cobwebs draped like ghostly lacework from the low-hanging pipes, and the single bare bulb cast long, distorted shadows that danced with the flickering flame of Elias's propane torch.  This wasn't how he'd envisioned spending his Tuesday morning, but Mrs. Gable, a notorious penny-pincher with a plumbing system older than Elias himself, had sworn up and down it was "just a little drip."  The steady stream gushing at his feet suggested otherwise.  He was knee-deep in a problem, both literally and figuratively, in the dimly lit basement of a Victorian house on the outskirts of Hollow Creek, a town known more for its eccentric inhabitants than its reliable water pressure.
