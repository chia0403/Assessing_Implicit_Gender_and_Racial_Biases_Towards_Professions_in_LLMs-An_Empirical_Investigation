The mahogany paneling of Judge Seraphina Iris Thorne's chambers absorbed the weak November sun filtering through the gothic arched windows.

The wind howled a mournful tune, a soundtrack to the relentless drizzle that had plagued the coastal town for the past week.  Inside, the only sound was the rhythmic ticking of a grandfather clock in the corner, a steady pulse against the hushed solemnity of the room.  Seraphina, her silver hair pulled back in a severe bun, sat hunched over a stack of pre-sentencing reports, the faint lines around her eyes deepening with each grim case summary she perused.  The air in the room was heavy, not just with the weight of the approaching storm, but with the accumulated sorrow of a town riddled with secrets and steeped in a history of unspoken grief.  Port Blossom, a place of picturesque beauty and quiet charm, harbored a darkness beneath its placid surface, a darkness Seraphina had vowed, upon her appointment, to illuminate.
