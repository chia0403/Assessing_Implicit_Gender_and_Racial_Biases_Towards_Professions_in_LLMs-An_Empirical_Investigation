The biting wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's auburn braid across her face as she trudged through the ankle-deep snow towards the primate enclosure.  Dawn was just beginning to paint the sky a bruised purple over the jagged peaks of the Cascade Mountains, casting long, skeletal shadows across the Oregon Primate Rescue Sanctuary.  The air, crisp and clean, carried the faint scent of pine and the sharper tang of something wilder â€“ the musk of the macaques, restless even before their morning meal.  Amy, bundled in a thick parka and waterproof trousers, stamped her feet to ward off the chill, her breath puffing out in white clouds.  The sanctuary, nestled in a remote valley, was a haven for rescued and rehabilitated primates from all over the world, a place of chattering calls, swinging limbs, and surprisingly complex social dynamics, a world Amy knew as intimately as her own backyard.  This morning, however, a peculiar silence hung in the air, broken only by the crunch of Amy's boots on the fresh snow, a silence that sent a prickle of unease down her spine.
