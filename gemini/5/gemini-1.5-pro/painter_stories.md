The salt spray kissed Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's face as she wrestled her easel against the fierce Cornish wind.  It was late October in Porthleven, a tiny fishing village nestled between granite cliffs so sheer they seemed to claw at the sky.  The cottages, huddled together against the elements, were painted in a riot of colours – faded turquoise, peeling pink, vibrant yellow – all muted now by the encroaching grey of the afternoon.  Amy, bundled in a thick wool coat the colour of dried seaweed, stubbornly anchored her easel on a patch of windswept grass overlooking the churning, iron-grey sea. Her fingers, already numb despite her gloves, fumbled with a tube of cerulean blue, the exact shade of the brief glimpse of sky she'd seen between the storm clouds just moments ago.  This was it, the perfect light, the perfect drama. This was the scene that had been burning in her mind for weeks, demanding to be captured.
