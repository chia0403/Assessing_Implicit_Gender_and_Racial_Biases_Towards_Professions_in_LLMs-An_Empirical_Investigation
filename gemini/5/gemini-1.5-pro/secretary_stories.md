The rhythmic clatter of Evelyn Beatrice Periwinkleâ€™s typewriter filled the otherwise silent office.  Outside, the neon glow of a Chicago speakeasy, the "Crimson Quill," spilled onto the rain-slicked streets, reflecting in the grimy windowpane.  It was 1928, and the air, thick with the scent of cheap gin and desperation, hung heavy over the city.  Evelyn, perched behind her mahogany desk in the sparsely furnished office of Bartholomew & Sons Import/Export, adjusted her spectacles and sighed.  Another late night. Another stack of invoices for exotic goods with dubiously vague descriptions.  Bartholomew "Bart" Senior was out "on business" as usual, which meant gallivanting around with chorus girls and making shady deals that even his son, the perpetually flustered Bartholomew Junior, knew nothing about. Evelyn, however, suspected more than she let on.  The faintest whiff of cloves and sandalwood clung to the invoices, a scent she'd only ever encountered in one place:  the opium dens tucked away in the labyrinthine alleys of Chinatown.
