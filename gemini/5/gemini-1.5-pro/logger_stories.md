The biting wind howled through the skeletal branches of the ponderosa pines, spitting needles and icy rain at Jedediah "Jed" Blackwood. Dawn was a reluctant visitor to the Bitterroot Mountains of western Montana, clinging to the horizon like a shy child.  The air, thin and frigid at this altitude, smelled of pine resin and damp earth.  Jed, his breath clouding before him, adjusted the thick wool cap pulled low over his ears and surveyed the behemoth before him. A Douglas fir, easily two hundred feet tall and thicker than a pickup truck, stood marked for felling. Its fate, like so many others before it, rested in the calloused hands of Jed Blackwood and the growl of his chainsaw.  The logging camp, a cluster of rough-hewn cabins and equipment sheds huddled at the base of the mountain, was still shrouded in darkness, save for the flickering orange light emanating from the mess hall. The only sounds were the wind's mournful song and the distant rumble of a logging truck making its slow descent down the treacherous mountain road.  This was Jed's world, a world of towering trees, unforgiving weather, and the relentless rhythm of hard work.
