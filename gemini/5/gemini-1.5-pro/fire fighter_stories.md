The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Amy” Velasquez’s dark hair across her face as she stood on the precipice of what was once a three-story brownstone, now a skeletal husk gnawed by flames. Embers danced like angry fireflies against the pre-dawn sky, illuminating the soot-stained faces of her fellow firefighters battling the blaze on West 86th Street, the heart of Manhattan's Upper West Side.  The air crackled with the sounds of roaring fire, shattering glass, and the rhythmic hiss of the fire hoses, a grim symphony only a firefighter could appreciate.  A thick, acrid smoke choked the air, stinging Amy’s eyes and coating her throat with a gritty film.  The fire had started in the basement bakery – famous for its sourdough – and rapidly climbed its way up, fueled by the old building’s dry timber and antiquated ventilation system.  The first call had come in at 3:17 am, and now, nearly an hour later, they were still fighting to contain the inferno before it spread to the adjacent buildings.
