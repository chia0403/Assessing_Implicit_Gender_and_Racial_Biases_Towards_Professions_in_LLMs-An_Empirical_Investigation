The aroma of stale apple juice and dried Play-Doh hung heavy in the air, a comforting perfume Miss Eleanor Vance had grown accustomed to over her fifteen years at Sunny Meadow Kindergarten.  October sunlight, fractured by the vibrant leaves of a massive oak tree just outside the classroom window, splashed across the miniature tables and chairs, illuminating a thin layer of glitter that seemed to permanently coat every surface. Sunny Meadow, nestled in the sleepy, apple-orchard-dotted town of Harmony Creek, Vermont, was a place of sticky fingers, boundless energy, and the constant, joyful cacophony of five-year-olds discovering the world.  This Tuesday morning, however, felt different.  A strange stillness permeated the room, punctuated only by the rhythmic ticking of the oversized ladybug clock above the doorway.  Miss Vance, her usually bright eyes clouded with a faint unease, stood by the window, watching the leaves swirl down in the crisp autumn air.  Something was amiss, she could feel it in the very fiber of her normally cheerful classroom.
