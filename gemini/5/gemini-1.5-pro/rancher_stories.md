He pulled his Stetson down further, the brim brushing against the thick, salt-and-pepper beard that covered the lower half of his face.  The sky, a bruised purple-grey, promised snow before nightfall, and Elias knew he had to get the stragglers back to the barn.  His ranch, the Broken Spur, sprawled across thousands of acres of rolling Montana grassland, a tapestry of ochre and burnt sienna beneath the darkening sky.  The ranch house, a sturdy log cabin built by his grandfather, stood solitary against the vastness, smoke curling invitingly from its chimney.  But warmth and comfort were a distant promise; right now, Elias had a job to do.  Two Hereford heifers, lured by a patch of stubbornly green grass near the creek, were ignoring his calls, their breath puffing white clouds into the frigid air.  He adjusted his grip on the worn stockman's cane, a testament to a life lived hard, and started down the slope, the frozen earth crunching beneath his heavy boots.
