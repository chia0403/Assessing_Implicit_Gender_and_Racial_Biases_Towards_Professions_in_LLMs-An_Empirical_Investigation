The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorne's ankles as he crouched beside the rusted base of the WKTA radio tower, a thermos of lukewarm coffee clutched in his gloved hand.  Ice crystals glittered on the guy wires, stretching up into the pre-dawn gloom like frozen spiderwebs.  Above him, the skeletal metal framework disappeared into the low-hanging clouds that blanketed the isolated peak of Mount Blackwood, the highest point in the desolate, pine-covered hills of northern Maine. WKTA, the only voice for miles in every direction, had fallen silent just before midnight, and Elias, the station's solitary, and increasingly eccentric, technician, was the only one who could coax it back to life.  The air smelled of pine needles and damp earth, and the only sound besides the wind was the mournful howl of a distant coyote, a sound Elias had come to consider a regular part of his lonely vigil.
