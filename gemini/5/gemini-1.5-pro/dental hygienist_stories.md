The insistent Vermont wind howled a mournful tune around the eaves of the Sugar Maple Dental Clinic, rattling the frosted panes of the waiting room windows.  Inside, the air hummed with the low thrum of the sterilizer and the faint scent of peppermint antiseptic.  Eleanor Vance, RDH, adjusted the tiny magnifying glasses perched on her nose and sighed.  It was a Tuesday afternoon in late November, the kind of day that felt both endless and fleeting, a grey blur punctuated only by the rhythmic scrape of her scaler against enamel.  Stowe, Vermont, usually a picturesque postcard of snow-dusted peaks and cozy ski lodges, was today just a canvas of muted greys and whites, mirroring the pervasive weariness Eleanor felt settling in her bones. The ski season hadn't quite kicked off, leaving the town in that awkward in-between state, a lull before the festive storm. And Eleanor, usually invigorated by the crisp mountain air, found herself inexplicably drained, the familiar routine of polishing and probing feeling strangely heavy.  She glanced at the clock â€“ 2:47 pm.  Just another hour and thirteen minutes until she could escape the relentless whir of the drill and the endless loop of dental health advice playing softly on the waiting room television.  Little did she know, those seventy-three minutes were about to change everything.
