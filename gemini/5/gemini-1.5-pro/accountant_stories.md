Rain lashed against the leaded windows of Amelia Grace Hawthorne's office, blurring the already fading light of the late November afternoon.  The rhythmic tapping, almost a mournful drumming, seemed to echo the unsettling rhythm in Amelia’s chest.  Her office, perched on the fifth floor of the Grimshaw Building, usually offered a commanding view of the Chicago skyline, the skyscrapers like metallic sentinels against the vastness of Lake Michigan. Today, however, a thick, grey curtain of precipitation obscured everything beyond the windowpane, creating a sense of claustrophobia within the usually spacious room.  Stacks of files, neatly labelled with Amelia’s precise hand, rose like miniature city blocks on her mahogany desk, a testament to the tax season's relentless onslaught.  The air smelled faintly of old paper and the Earl Grey tea Amelia favoured, a scent usually comforting, but tonight, it felt oppressive. Something was amiss, a discordant note in the otherwise meticulously ordered symphony of Amelia’s life.
