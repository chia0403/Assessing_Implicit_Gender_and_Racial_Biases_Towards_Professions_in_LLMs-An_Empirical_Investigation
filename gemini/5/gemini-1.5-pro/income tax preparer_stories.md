Outside, a drizzle painted the already-grey streets a duller shade of misery.  Amelia, her usually meticulously coiffed auburn hair escaping its bun, rubbed her temples, the faint thrum of a caffeine headache battling with the insistent gnawing of hunger.  A half-eaten tuna sandwich lay forlornly on a plate beside a precarious stack of 1040 forms.

Amelia sighed.  Just one more day. Just one more day of unraveling the tangled financial lives of Harmony Creek's residents before she could finally collapse into a blissful, tax-free slumber. But something told her this last day wouldn't be quite so simple.
