The chipped turquoise paint of the "Nail It!" salon door screeched like a rusty swing set as Evangeline "Evie" Dupres pushed it open. The humid New Orleans air, thick with the scent of beignets and impending rain, rushed in, momentarily dispelling the chemical tang that clung to everything inside. It was a Tuesday morning in late July, the kind where the heat hung heavy and still, promising a thunderstorm that would likely never arrive.  Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, illuminating rows of neatly arranged polish bottles that shimmered like jewels.  Evie, in her signature starched white apron and cherry-red lipstick, surveyed her domain. Two elderly ladies gossiped under hair dryers in the back, and a young woman with anxious eyes nervously flipped through a magazine in one of the plush pedicure chairs.  But otherwise, the salon was quiet, the calm before the inevitable Wednesday afternoon rush.  Evie placed her worn, leather satchel on the counter, the quiet clink of her essential oils a familiar sound against the otherwise hushed anticipation. Today felt different though, a prickle of unease dancing beneath her perfectly polished fingernails.
