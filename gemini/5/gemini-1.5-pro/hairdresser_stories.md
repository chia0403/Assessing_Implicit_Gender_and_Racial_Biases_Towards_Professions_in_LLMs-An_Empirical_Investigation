The aroma of coconut oil and burnt sugar clung to the air in "Shear Perfection," a small salon nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed fortune teller's shop on Sycamore Street.  Rain hammered against the large bay window, blurring the neon "Open" sign and turning the street outside into a shimmering, distorted canvas.  Inside, Eloise Clementine Dubois, her fiery red hair piled high in an intricate braid, sighed dramatically, wiping stray clippings from her black smock.  The only other occupant of the salon was a wilting peace lily in the corner, its leaves drooping like a disappointed customer. The clock above the reception desk ticked with exaggerated slowness, each second an audible reminder of the dismal Tuesday afternoon trade.  Eloise tapped a perfectly manicured fingernail against the counter, her gaze fixed on the relentless downpour. This was not how she’d envisioned her Tuesday.  This was not how she’d envisioned her life.
