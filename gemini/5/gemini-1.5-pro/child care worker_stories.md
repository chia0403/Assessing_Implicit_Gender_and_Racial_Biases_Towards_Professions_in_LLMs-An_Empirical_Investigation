The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne's auburn braid across her cheek as she wrestled a stubbornly flapping poster onto the bulletin board outside Little Wonders Day Care.  The poster, depicting a cartoon turkey wearing a pilgrim hat and clutching a cornucopia overflowing with construction paper vegetables, announced the upcoming Thanksgiving feast.  Little Wonders, a converted Victorian house nestled amongst the towering redwoods of Redwood Valley, California, looked particularly charming under the bruised purple sky of the approaching dusk.  The warm glow emanating from the large bay windows promised cocoa, story time, and the comforting scent of cinnamon playdough that permeated every corner of the building.  Inside, the excited shrieks of children could be heard even over the rustling of the redwood branches, a chaotic symphony that Amelia found strangely soothing.  It was the last Friday before Thanksgiving break, and the energy in the air was palpable, a mixture of anticipation and that special kind of exhausted joy that only comes at the end of a long week with little ones.
