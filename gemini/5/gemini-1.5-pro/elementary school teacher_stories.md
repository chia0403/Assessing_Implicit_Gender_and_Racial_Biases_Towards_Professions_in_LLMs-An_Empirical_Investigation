The fluorescent lights of Mrs. Eleanor Vance's fourth-grade classroom hummed a monotonous tune, occasionally punctuated by the rhythmic *thwack* of the wall clock's second hand.  St. Michael's Elementary, a squat brick building nestled amidst the sprawling pecan orchards of Dripping Springs, Texas, was usually abuzz with the chaotic energy of eight- and nine-year-olds.  But at 6:15 AM, a full hour and fifteen minutes before the first bell, the only sounds were Eleanor's quiet sighs as she arranged brightly colored construction paper on each of the twenty tiny desks.  A faint scent of pecan blossoms drifted in through the open window, mingling with the slightly chemical aroma of freshly-waxed floors.  Outside, the Texas sun was just beginning to paint the sky with strokes of pale orange and pink, promising another scorching summer day. Eleanor, however, wasn't focused on the sunrise. She was preoccupied, a small, crumpled piece of notebook paper clutched in her hand. A single word was scrawled across it in childish handwriting: "Help."
