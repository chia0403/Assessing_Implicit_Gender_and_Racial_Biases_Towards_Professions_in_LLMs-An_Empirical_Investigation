The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorne, snagging at the frayed edges of his insulated Carhartt jacket.  Tiny ice pellets, driven by the gale, stung his exposed cheeks as he wrestled the heavy toolbox out of the back of his battered Ford Ranger.  Above him, the neon sign of the Starlight Motel flickered erratically, casting a sickly green glow across the desolate parking lot. Located just off Highway 17, miles from the nearest town of Harmony Creek, Oregon, the motel was less a beacon of roadside comfort and more a blinking testament to forgotten dreams. Elias slammed the truck’s tailgate shut, the metallic clang echoing in the pre-dawn stillness. He’d gotten the call at 3:00 am – power outage, flickering lights, the usual.  But the panicked edge in Mrs. Henderson’s voice, the motel’s perpetually flustered owner, suggested this time it might be something more.
