The pre-dawn chill clung to Amelia Reyes like a damp sheet as she hurried across the deserted parking lot.  Fluorescent lights buzzed from within the Community Memorial Hospital, casting a sterile, cold glow against the inky October sky. Amelia tugged her burgundy cardigan tighter around herself, the embroidered "Phlebotomy" stitched across her chest barely visible in the dim light.

She liked to arrive early, to organize her tray, sharpen her needles, and mentally prepare herself for the hundreds of veins she would encounter throughout the day. Today, however, a strange unease prickled at her, a feeling that this particular Tuesday would be different.
