The biting wind whipped off the Chesapeake Bay, rattling the frosted panes of St. Jude's free clinic.  Inside, the waiting room, a kaleidoscope of threadbare coats and anxious coughs, hummed with a low, restless energy. Amelia Reyes, PA-C, rubbed warmth back into her numb fingers and glanced at the overflowing schedule. Another Tuesday night in Crisfield, Maryland, and the clinic was bursting at the seams. The smell of antiseptic and instant coffee hung thick in the air, a familiar perfume she’d come to associate with the quiet desperation of her patients.  Beyond the flimsy partition separating the waiting area from the exam rooms, a baby wailed, its cries punctuated by the rhythmic beeping of a blood pressure monitor.  Amelia took a deep breath, bracing herself for the tide of ailments and worries that awaited her.  The fishing boats were in, and with them came the inevitable injuries – lacerated hands, strained backs, the occasional broken bone. Tonight, though, a different kind of unease settled in Amelia's stomach.  Something felt...off.
