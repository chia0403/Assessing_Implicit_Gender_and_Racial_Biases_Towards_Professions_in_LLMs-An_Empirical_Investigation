The clatter of pots and pans, a symphony only Elias Thorne truly appreciated, echoed through the cramped galley kitchen of "The Wandering Starfish."  Salt spray misted the porthole window, partially obscuring the view of the churning turquoise waters of the Aegean Sea. Elias, his dark hair plastered to his forehead with a mixture of sweat and flour, hummed a jaunty tune as he kneaded dough for the evening's meal.  The Starfish, a dilapidated but charming fishing trawler converted into a floating restaurant, was his kingdom, a realm of bubbling sauces, sizzling spices, and the ever-present tang of the sea. Tonight's menu, scrawled on a chalkboard propped against a dented kettle, promised grilled octopus, lemon-roasted potatoes, and Elias's signature baklava â€“ a recipe passed down through generations of his Cretan family.  Beyond the galley's swinging door, the first diners were beginning to arrive, their laughter and the strumming of a bouzouki hinting at the lively evening to come.  The sun, a molten orange orb dipping towards the horizon, cast long shadows across the deck, painting the scene with a warmth that mirrored the feeling in Elias's heart.  He had found his place, not on solid ground, but on this gently rocking vessel, feeding souls and sharing stories under the vast, star-studded sky.
