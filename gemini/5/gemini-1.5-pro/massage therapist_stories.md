Elara's "Tranquility Cove Massage Therapy" studio, nestled in a converted Victorian cottage just blocks from the bustling Santa Cruz boardwalk, was a world away from the cacophony of crashing waves and screaming gulls. The rhythmic creaks of the old house, the gentle hum of the white noise machine, and Elara’s focused breathing created a pocket of serenity, a sanctuary she had carefully cultivated over the last five years.  But today, a disquiet buzzed beneath the surface of the calm, a feeling Elara couldn’t quite put her finger on. It was like the stillness before a storm, the air thick with unspoken anticipation.
