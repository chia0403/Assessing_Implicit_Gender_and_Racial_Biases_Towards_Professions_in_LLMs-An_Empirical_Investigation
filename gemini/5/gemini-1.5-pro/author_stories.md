The salt spray kissed Amelia Grace Hawthorne's face as she leaned against the weathered railing of her seaside cottage, the rhythmic crash of waves against the rocky shore a familiar lullaby.  Perched precariously on a cliff overlooking the churning grey expanse of the North Atlantic, "Sea Whisper," as she affectionately called it, was her sanctuary, her escape, and more often than not, the birthplace of her stories.  The cottage, a rambling, two-story structure of grey stone and driftwood, clung to the edge of the Cornish coast like a tenacious limpet.  Inside, a fire crackled merrily in the hearth, casting dancing shadows across the book-lined walls and illuminating the half-finished manuscript lying open on her antique writing desk.  A storm was brewing, the wind howling a mournful song through the gaps in the window frames, but Amelia, lost in the world she was creating, remained oblivious.  This remote corner of England, with its dramatic cliffs, hidden coves, and whispering winds, had always been her muse.  But this time, something felt different.  This time, the story was fighting back.
