The flickering fluorescent lights of the Weathersby & Thorne law offices buzzed in Amelia Hayes' ears, a relentless soundtrack to her Tuesday morning. Rain lashed against the panoramic windows overlooking downtown Portland, Oregon, blurring the city lights into a hazy, impressionistic painting.  Amelia, her dark hair pulled back in a practical bun, hunched over a mountain of discovery documents, the faint scent of stale coffee clinging to the air.  She was, for the most part, alone.  Most of the lawyers, including Mr. Weathersby and Mr. Thorne themselves, were at a conference in Seattle, leaving a skeleton crew to man the phones and fend off the insistent demands of opposing counsel. This, Amelia had learned in her five years as a paralegal, was the true face of corporate law: less dramatic courtroom showdowns and more meticulously organizing and summarizing the minutiae of other people's lives.  This particular case, the Thompson v. Peterson property dispute, involved a particularly acrimonious divorce and a contested vineyard in the Willamette Valley.  Amelia sighed, pushing a stray curl behind her ear and taking a sip of lukewarm tea.  The vineyard sounded lovely; she couldn't imagine fighting over something so beautiful. Just then, the phone on her desk trilled, shattering the fragile peace.
