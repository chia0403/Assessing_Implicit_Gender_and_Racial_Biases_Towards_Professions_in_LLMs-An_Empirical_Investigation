It was a brutally cold January night, the kind that froze exposed skin within minutes.  A thin layer of ice glazed the metal landing, making the already treacherous approach even more precarious.  The radio clipped to Amy’s thick parka crackled to life, the dispatcher’s voice tight with urgency. "Ambulance 61, be advised, incoming trauma, ETA two minutes.  Possible GSW to the abdomen, victim critical."  Amy took a deep breath, the frigid air burning her lungs. Tonight, like so many others, was going to be a fight.
