The air in Elias Thorne's workshop hung thick with the scent of beeswax, wool, and the faint ghost of pipe tobacco.  Rain lashed against the mullioned windows, a relentless drumming that echoed the rhythmic clatter of Elias's treadle sewing machine. His workshop, tucked away on a cobbled lane called Weaver's Alley in the perpetually damp port city of Aethelgard, was a haven of ordered chaos. Bolts of cloth in vibrant hues and somber shades lined the walls, their textures ranging from the rough weave of homespun linen to the shimmering luxury of imported silks.  Pins glittered like scattered jewels on a velvet cushion, and half-finished garments draped over dress forms, waiting for Elias's skilled hands to bring them to life. Outside, the gas lamps of Aethelgard flickered weakly against the encroaching dusk, painting the rain-slicked streets in a hazy orange glow. This evening, however, Elias wasnâ€™t focused on the storm or the beauty of his craft.  A single, crumpled letter lay on his workbench, its ink blurred by a trembling hand, and it was this missive, not the weather, that cast a shadow over his usually cheerful face.
