Rain lashed against the window of Archibald Finch's cramped office, mimicking the drumming anxiety in his chest.  The flickering neon sign of the "Finch & Sons Insurance" (the "Sons" being a hopeful fabrication, Archibald being utterly alone in the enterprise) cast a sickly green glow over the water-stained ceiling tiles.  Ashworth, Ohio, a town whose heyday was sometime around the invention of the spork, wasn't exactly a booming metropolis, and Archibald's office, sandwiched between a laundromat with a perpetually broken dryer and a taxidermy shop with a perpetually unsettling gaze from its window display, reflected the town's general air of faded glory.  It was a Tuesday, the slowest day of the week, a day usually reserved for catching up on paperwork and staring forlornly at the overflowing "Potential Clients" file, a file that, in reality, held little potential and a lot of dust.  But this Tuesday was different. This Tuesday, Mrs. Gladys Periwinkle, owner of the town's only bakery and purveyor of the finest (and only) rhubarb pies in Ashworth, had walked in, her face whiter than her usual baker's flour, claiming her prized, award-winning, blue-ribbon rhubarb pie had beenâ€¦stolen.
