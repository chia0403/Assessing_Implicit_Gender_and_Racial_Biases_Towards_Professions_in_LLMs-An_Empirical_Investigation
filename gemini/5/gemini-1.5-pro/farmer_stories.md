The wind, sharp and smelling of coming snow, whipped at Elias Thatcher's thick wool coat as he surveyed the frosted fields of Thatcher's Hollow.  Nestled deep in the Appalachian Mountains of western North Carolina, the hollow was a cradle of rolling farmland, ringed by peaks now dusted with white.  Elias, his weathered face etched with the lines of a life spent battling the elements and coaxing a living from the unforgiving earth, rubbed his calloused hands together.  November had arrived with a vengeance, and the first hard freeze was just a matter of time. He had one last field of pumpkins to harvest before winter truly set in, their orange globes gleaming like jewels scattered across the browning earth. A raven croaked from a bare branch overlooking the field, a stark reminder of the seasonâ€™s turn. The hollow, usually vibrant with the buzz of insects and birdsong, held a hushed expectancy, bracing for the long, cold sleep ahead.
