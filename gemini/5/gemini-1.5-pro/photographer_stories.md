The biting wind whipped Amelia Reyes’s dark hair across her face as she crouched behind a crumbling drystone wall, the rough granite scratching against her thick tweed coat.  Her breath puffed out in white clouds, mirroring the swirling mist that clung to the slopes of Ben Cruachan, the highest peak in Argyll. Below her, Loch Awe stretched like a sheet of pewter, reflecting the brooding, iron-grey sky.  Amelia adjusted the long lens of her Nikon D850, its cold metal a stark contrast to the fingerless gloves she wore. She was after a specific shot – the elusive golden eagle that nested somewhere in these rugged crags.  For three days she’d been battling the elements, perched in precarious positions, fuelled by lukewarm coffee and sheer stubborn determination.  This was the moment she’d been waiting for, the light finally breaking through the clouds to illuminate the jagged peaks. It was now, or perhaps not for another week, that she'd have a chance to capture the eagle in its domain.  The air thrummed with anticipation, a primal energy that resonated with the ancient landscape.
