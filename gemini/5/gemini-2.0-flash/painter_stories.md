The late afternoon sun, a bruised apricot in the October sky, bled across the canvas, washing out the subtle greys that were Esme Willowbrook's obsession. She squinted, tilting her head. The light was all wrong, casting an artificial warmth that belied the bite in the air, the starkness of the landscape she was trying to capture. Sighing, Esme laid down her brush, the clatter echoing in the cavernous space of the old mill.

The mill itself, christened Willow Creek Mill back when its wheels had actually churned grain instead of just rusting in silence, was Esme's sanctuary, her prison, and her muse, all rolled into one draughty, echoing structure. Situated on the outskirts of the tiny, forgotten town of Havenwood, nestled deep in the Appalachian Mountains, it was a place where time seemed to slow, where the rustle of leaves and the murmur of the creek were the loudest sounds, and where Esme could, theoretically, lose herself completely in her art. The vast, echoing main room, with its soaring ceilings and rough-hewn beams, was perfect for housing her massive canvases, the light filtering through the grime-streaked windows in dramatic shafts. The air always smelled faintly of damp wood and dust, a scent that had become as familiar to her as her own name. She'd inherited the mill from a distant aunt, a woman she’d barely known, and had retreated here two years ago, seeking solace and inspiration after… well, after everything fell apart. Havenwood, with its quiet desperation and its deeply rooted secrets, had seemed like the perfect place to disappear. Whether she'd found what she was looking for was another matter entirely.
