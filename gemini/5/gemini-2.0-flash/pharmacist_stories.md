Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a pharmacist:

**Setting:**

The setting is Harmony Falls, a small town nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. The town square, dominated by a weathered Civil War statue and a bubbling fountain, is the heart of Harmony Falls. Around the square are family-owned businesses â€“ Martha's Diner, known for its blueberry pie; Hank's Hardware, boasting "everything and more!"; and, most importantly for our story, Oakhaven Pharmacy. Oakhaven, with its faded green awning and window display featuring antique medicine bottles alongside current health products, is more than just a pharmacy; it's a community hub. The air inside always smells faintly of peppermint and chamomile, a comforting aroma that speaks of care and old-fashioned remedies. The time is late autumn; crisp air tinged with woodsmoke drifts through town, and the leaves are a vibrant tapestry of crimson, gold, and russet.

**Story Opening:**

The bell above the Oakhaven Pharmacy door jingled, announcing Mrs. Abernathy's arrival with a puff of wind that swirled a few fallen maple leaves into the shop. Abigail Willowbrook, her full name a mouthful she rarely used, barely glanced up from the prescription she was filling. "Morning, Mrs. Abernathy," she said, her voice warm and familiar, like a well-loved blanket. She carefully counted out thirty tablets of amlodipine besylate, her movements precise and practiced. Abigail was a pharmacist through and through; a calming presence behind the counter for fifteen years.

"Abigail, dear," Mrs. Abernathy began, her voice trembling slightly, "it's about young Timmy Henderson..."

Abigail's heart hitched just a fraction. Timmy Henderson was a cheerful, bright-eyed boy, battling a stubborn case of pneumonia. She capped the medication bottle, her intuition already whispering a premonition of bad news. She turned fully towards Mrs. Abernathy, her expression now a picture of gentle concern. "What's wrong, Mrs. Abernathy? Is he...?"
