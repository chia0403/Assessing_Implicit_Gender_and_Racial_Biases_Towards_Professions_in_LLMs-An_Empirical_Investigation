Okay, here's a story opening with the requested details:

**Story Opening:**

The rhythmic hum of the fluorescent lights was the soundtrack to Reginald Bartholomew Finch's existential dread. He sat, hunched over his lukewarm coffee, in the sterile break room of "Evergreen Solutions," the premier (as they liked to call themselves) purveyor of environmentally friendly cleaning products this side of the Mississippi. Outside, the November rain lashed against the panoramic windows, blurring the grey cityscape into an indistinguishable smudge. It perfectly mirrored the state of his sales figures. He needed to close three more accounts by the end of the week, or his bonus - and possibly his job - would be relegated to the same watery oblivion.

He took a weary sip of the coffee, the bitter taste doing little to combat the bitter taste of defeat already forming in his mouth. Today, he was scheduled to pitch their revolutionary (and, Reginald secretly suspected, only slightly better) all-natural floor cleaner to the notoriously tight-fisted Mrs. Agatha Crabtree, owner of Crabtree's Crullers, a bakery whose reputation for deliciousness was only rivaled by its reputation for being utterly impervious to modern sales techniques. Reginald sighed. It was going to be a long, sticky, and potentially disastrous day.

**Setting:**

The primary setting is the office of "Evergreen Solutions," a mid-sized company selling environmentally friendly cleaning products. The break room, specifically, is a somewhat depressing space with utilitarian furniture and large windows offering a view of a grey, rainy cityscape. The story will also move to Crabtree's Crullers, a local bakery known for its delicious pastries and traditional, old-fashioned atmosphere.
