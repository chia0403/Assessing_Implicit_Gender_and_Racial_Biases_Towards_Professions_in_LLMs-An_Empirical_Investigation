The fluorescent lights of "Shop 'n Save" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Rose Hawthorne's Thursday afternoon. Outside, a persistent drizzle painted the windows with blurry streaks, promising a miserable commute home. Amelia sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear with a hand that was starting to feel permanently sticky from scanning barcodes. She'd already rung up Mrs. Gabblethorpe's cat food (again - seriously, how many cats did that woman have?), a sullen teenager buying only a single pack of gum, and a frazzled young mother juggling a screaming toddler and a basket overflowing with overpriced organic baby food.

Her perch, register number three, offered a limited view. Beyond the automatic doors lay the grey expanse of the parking lot, punctuated by the occasional splash of red brake lights. To her left, aisle seven stretched endlessly, stacked high with breakfast cereals and sugary snacks â€“ a testament to humanity's poor dietary choices, Amelia mused. To her right, the magazine rack displayed glossy covers promising perfect skin, perfect bodies, and perfect lives, none of which Amelia felt remotely close to achieving. The air hung thick with the aroma of day-old donuts from the bakery and the faint, lingering scent of disinfectant, a constant reminder of the countless hands that had touched this very counter, this very register, before her. It wasn't glamorous, it wasn't exciting, but it was a job, and right now, Amelia desperately needed it.
