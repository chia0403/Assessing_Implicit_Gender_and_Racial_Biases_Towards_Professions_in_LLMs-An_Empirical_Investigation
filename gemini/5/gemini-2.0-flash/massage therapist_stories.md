## Opening:

The persistent hum of the air conditioner was a dissonant counterpoint to the calming flute music streaming softly from the speakers. Amelia Grace Thorne sighed, running a hand over the pristine white sheet draped across her massage table. Her fingers, usually so attuned to the knots and tensions of her clients, felt clumsy and restless today. It was Monday morning, and Mondays were always a slow burn at "Kneadful Things," her small, sun-drenched studio tucked away in the heart of Havenwood. 

Another minute ticked by on the digital clock above her desk. Ten past nine. Where was Mrs. Hemlock? Amelia had been looking forward to starting her week with a deep-tissue on the retired librarian, a woman whose sharp wit and encyclopedic knowledge always left Amelia feeling brighter, even after spending an hour untangling the years of accumulated posture she carried in her shoulders. Maybe Mrs. Hemlock had simply forgotten. Or, Amelia thought with a prickle of anxiety, maybe something was wrong.

## Setting:

**Kneadful Things** was located on the second floor of a charming, slightly dilapidated Victorian building on Havenwood's main street. Sunlight streamed through the large, arched windows, bathing the studio in a warm, inviting glow. The walls were painted a soft sage green, accented with framed prints of botanicals and calming landscapes. The air was always subtly scented with lavender and chamomile, a carefully curated blend designed to promote relaxation.

The main room was dominated by Amelia's massage table, a comfortable and well-worn piece of equipment that felt like an extension of herself. In one corner stood a comfortable armchair and a small table laden with herbal teas and flavored water. The other corner held a small bookshelf filled with books on aromatherapy, anatomy, and holistic healing.

Just off the main room was a small, well-organized bathroom with plush towels and a rainfall shower, perfect for rinsing off after a particularly oily massage. Everything about Kneadful Things, from the meticulously chosen decorations to the calming color palette, was designed to create a sanctuary, a place where people could escape the stresses of their daily lives and reconnect with their bodies. However, today, the usually peaceful atmosphere felt tinged with a faint, unsettling unease.
