The humid Georgia air hung thick and heavy, a tangible blanket pressing down on Arthur Lee Jenkins as he leaned against the back of the orange highway truck. The sun, already a malevolent eye in the cloudless sky at 8:00 AM, glared off the shimmering asphalt, making the heat even more unbearable. Arthur Lee squinted, pulling the brim of his faded blue baseball cap lower over his eyes. He could practically feel the sweat gathering at the small of his back, soaking through his equally faded blue work shirt, emblazoned with the Georgia Department of Transportation logo.

This stretch of I-16 West, just outside of Metter, Georgia, wasn't known for its scenic beauty. It was just flat, unforgiving land punctuated by the occasional pine tree and the unending ribbon of highway that snaked its way to Macon. Today, Arthur Lee and his crew were patching potholes, a Sisyphean task in the unrelenting heat. The air reeked of hot tar and diesel fumes, a familiar and strangely comforting aroma that had become the soundtrack of Arthur Lee's life for the last twenty years. He straightened, grabbing his shovel, and sighed. Another day, another hole to fill. Another endless expanse of asphalt under the merciless Georgia sun.
