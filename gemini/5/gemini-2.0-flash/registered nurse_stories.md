**Setting:** The stale, recycled air of the St. Jude's Hospital emergency room hung heavy, thick with the smells of disinfectant, stale coffee, and something faintly acrid that could only be described as fear. The fluorescents buzzed overhead, casting a harsh, unflattering light on the linoleum floor and the constant churn of activity. It was 3:17 AM – the witching hour, as some called it – when the city seemed to surrender its secrets, both ugly and beautiful, to the mercy of the ER staff.

**Opening:** The rhythmic beeping of a cardiac monitor was the soundtrack to Evelyn Grace O’Connell’s life tonight. She’d already been on her feet for twelve hours, the last six spent primarily between Trauma Bay 2 and the rapidly filling waiting room. Her navy blue scrubs were creased and bore the faint, telltale splatter pattern of something she preferred not to think about. Leaning against the counter, nursing a lukewarm cup of instant coffee, she closed her eyes for a brief, desperate moment. Just a second. Just to let the pounding in her temples subside. Before she could savor the stolen reprieve, the frantic squeal of ambulance sirens sliced through the night, and Evelyn knew, with a weariness that settled deep in her bones, that her quiet moment was over.
