The midday sun beat down on the baked earth of Redemption Valley, Wyoming, turning the dust devils dancing near the corral into shimmering mirages. Dr. Eleanor Mae Harding wiped a bead of sweat from her brow with the back of her calloused hand, leaving a smudge of pale pink ointment across her forehead. The air hung heavy with the smell of hay, manure, and the sharp, unmistakable tang of disinfectant.

Eleanor adjusted the worn Stetson that shadowed her kind, hazel eyes and surveyed the scene before her. Old Man Hemlock's prize-winning Angus bull, "Big Kahuna," lay listlessly in the shade of a sprawling cottonwood, its massive frame heaving with each shallow breath. Flies buzzed incessantly around a deep gash on his flank, a wound likely caused by a rogue barbed wire fence.

This wasn't the manicured, air-conditioned clinic Eleanor had envisioned when she graduated top of her class from CSU's vet program. No fluffy Persians or pampered poodles here. This was hardscrabble country, where the nearest hospital was a two-hour drive away and the livestock were as tough and resilient as the people who raised them. Redemption Valley was a place where a vet was less a doctor and more a vital lifeline, and Eleanor, despite her occasional doubts and persistent homesickness, was slowly realizing she wouldn't have it any other way.
