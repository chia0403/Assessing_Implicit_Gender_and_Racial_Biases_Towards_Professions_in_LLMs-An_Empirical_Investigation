## Story Opening:

The scent of stale potpourri and lingering lemon Pledge hung heavy in the air, a potent combination that almost masked the underlying musk of desperation. Evelyn Rose Cavendish, a woman who could usually sell a house in hell with a smile and a staging budget, felt a shiver crawl down her spine. This house... this house was different. The wallpaper, a particularly heinous shade of avocado green with a pattern that resembled mutating paisley, peeled in long, accusing strips. Dust bunnies the size of kittens skittered across the hardwood floor. And the silence... the oppressive, humming silence... was punctuated only by the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock in the hallway, a clock Evelyn was certain had stopped years ago.

"Just breathe, Evie," she murmured to herself, adjusting the strap of her briefcase. "It's just an old house. Needs a little TLC. Think positive, think profit."

She adjusted her lipstick in the reflection of a grimy window, forcing a smile. This was it. Show time. Time to spin this dusty, dated nightmare into a charming, historical gem for the discerning buyer. But as she turned to face the echoing hallway, she couldn't shake the feeling that this house had a story to tell. And she had a sinking feeling it wasn't going to be a happy one.

## Setting:

**Location:** Havenwood, a small, isolated town nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains in North Carolina. Known for its dense forests, picturesque hiking trails, and a population that hadn't changed much in the last fifty years, Havenwood clung fiercely to its old-fashioned ways.

**Specific Setting:** The house in question is known locally as "The Blackwood Manor," a sprawling, two-story Victorian house located on the outskirts of town, overlooking a vast, overgrown orchard. It had been vacant for nearly a decade, following the mysterious disappearance of its former owner, a reclusive antiques dealer named Silas Blackwood. The house is rumored to be haunted, a legend that Evelyn, a staunch pragmatist, usually dismissed as small-town gossip. But the oppressive atmosphere and unsettling energy emanating from the house were beginning to make her question her own skepticism. The overgrown grounds, with their tangled vines and gnarled trees, add to the house's sense of isolation and decay. It is late afternoon, casting long, eerie shadows across the property.
