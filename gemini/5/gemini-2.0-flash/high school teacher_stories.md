The smell of stale coffee clung to the air like a persistent cough, a familiar and unwelcome guest in the early morning silence of Northwood High's faculty lounge. Ms. Genevieve Eleanor Hawthorne, AP Literature teacher extraordinaire and perpetual wearer of slightly-too-large cardigans, stared blankly at the chipped formica countertop, a half-eaten banana bread muffin mocking her lack of appetite. Outside, the November wind howled, rattling the aging windowpanes and promising a day filled with hormonal chaos and existential teenage angst, a weather forecast that mirrored her own internal state rather accurately. The fluorescent lights hummed with a monotonous buzz, adding to the general sense of pre-emptive defeat that had settled over Genevieve like a lead blanket. She sighed, tracing the rim of her lukewarm coffee with a fingernail. Another day, another hundred-plus essays to grade, another volley of vague and unenthusiastic pronouncements about the symbolism of the green light in *The Great Gatsby*.
