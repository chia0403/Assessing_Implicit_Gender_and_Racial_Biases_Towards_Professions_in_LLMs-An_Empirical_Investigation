## Story Opening:

The squeal of rubber against freshly swept concrete sliced through the otherwise tranquil morning. Dr. Eleanor Vance, her auburn braid bouncing against her spine, winced and paused her deep breathing exercise. It was almost always Mrs. Gable, arriving far too early for her 9:00 AM appointment and somehow managing to park at a 45-degree angle in the designated space. Eleanor suspected she did it just to test her patience, a daily ritual preceding the much more delicate art of adjusting Mrs. Gable's stubborn cervical vertebrae.

Eleanor blew out a controlled exhale, trying to recapture the serenity she’d been cultivating. She needed to be centered. Today was the day. She was finally presenting her research to the board. Years of dedication, countless late nights analyzing data, and the lingering scent of liniment ingrained in her clothes had all led to this moment. Her theory, if proven and accepted, could revolutionize the treatment of chronic back pain.

But the sound of a car door slamming, followed by Mrs. Gable’s distinctive, high-pitched greeting, was a jarring reminder that the real world, and its persistent aches and pains, was waiting. Time to put aside the scientific fervor and embrace the chaotic ballet of the human spine.
## Setting:

**Inside "The Spine Aligned" Chiropractic Clinic, Oakhaven, Pennsylvania.**

The clinic occupies the ground floor of a beautifully restored Victorian house on Elm Street. Light floods in through the large bay windows, softened by gauzy white curtains. The reception area is decorated in calming shades of sage green and cream, with touches of natural wood. Instead of the typical sterile, clinical feel, Eleanor has cultivated a more inviting atmosphere. Potted ferns hang from macrame hangers, and a small fountain gurgles softly in the corner.

Beyond the reception area are two treatment rooms, each equipped with a state-of-the-art chiropractic table, anatomical charts, and shelves lined with exercise balls, resistance bands, and various diagnostic tools. Eleanor's personal office, tucked in the back, is a more cluttered space – a testament to her research and passion. Stacks of medical journals compete for space with anatomical models and a whiteboard covered in equations and diagrams. It's a room that speaks of both meticulous study and creative exploration, a fitting reflection of Dr. Eleanor Vance herself. Outside, the crisp autumn air carries the scent of fallen leaves and woodsmoke, a comforting reminder of the small-town charm that drew Eleanor to Oakhaven in the first place.
