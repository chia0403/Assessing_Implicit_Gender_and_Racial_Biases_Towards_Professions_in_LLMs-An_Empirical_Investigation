Okay, here's a story opening and setting, featuring an architect named Amelia Beatrice Bellweather:

**Story Opening:**

The Mediterranean sun, brutal and unforgiving, beat down on Amelia Beatrice Bellweather's neck, turning the thin film of sunscreen into a sticky, uncomfortable glaze. She squinted, pushing her oversized sunglasses further up her nose as she surveyed the skeletal remains of what would, one day, be the Villa Azure. The air, thick with the scent of pine and sun-baked earth, vibrated with the rhythmic clang of hammers and the shouts of the construction crew. Even through the din, Amelia could hear the relentless chirping of cicadas, a sound that had initially charmed her but was now starting to fray her nerves.

She consulted the blueprints clutched in her hand, their crisp lines contrasting sharply with the dust-covered reality of the half-finished structure. Something wasn't quite right. She ran a hand through her short, choppy brown hair, a gesture she knew was more about frustration than functionality. The sweep of the living room arch…it felt off. Too pedestrian. Not enough drama.

"Signorina Bellweather?" a gravelly voice called.

Amelia lowered her blueprints and turned to see Enzo, the grizzled foreman, his face etched with a thousand wrinkles carved by the sun and years of hard labor, approaching. "Enzo. What is it?"

"Signor Rossi is here. He wishes to speak with you about the, how do you say...the fountain." Enzo’s eyes twinkled with a hint of mischief. He clearly knew more than he was letting on. Amelia straightened her linen shirt, a sigh escaping her lips. This was going to be a long day.

**Setting:**

The story is set on a rugged, sun-drenched hillside overlooking the sparkling turquoise waters of the Amalfi Coast in Italy. The location is a construction site for a luxurious, modern villa, called Villa Azure, commissioned by a wealthy, but notoriously demanding, Italian businessman named Signor Rossi.

The villa is still in its early stages of construction, a chaotic mix of exposed concrete, rebar skeletons, and piles of terracotta tiles. The air is filled with the sounds of construction, the scent of cement and wood, and the ever-present heat of the Mediterranean sun.

The surroundings are both beautiful and unforgiving. Lush olive groves and vineyards cling to the steep slopes, interspersed with rocky outcrops and patches of scrubland. In the distance, the shimmering sea stretches out to the horizon, a tantalizing reminder of the cool, refreshing respite that lies just beyond the reach of the relentless sun.
