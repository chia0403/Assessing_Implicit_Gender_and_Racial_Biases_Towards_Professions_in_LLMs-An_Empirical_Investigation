Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring an editor named Eloise Beatrice Hawthorne:

**Setting:** A cramped, chaotic, but charming little independent bookstore called "The Written Word" in the West Village of New York City. The bookstore, while quaint, is bursting with overflowing shelves, stacks of books threatening to topple, and the scent of old paper mingling with the faint aroma of stale coffee from the café in the back. Mismatched armchairs and floor lamps provide cozy reading nooks, and hand-written recommendation cards peek out from between the spines. Outside, rain is drumming against the awning and cobblestone streets, lending a cozy, almost claustrophobic atmosphere inside.

**Story Opening:**

Eloise Beatrice Hawthorne squinted at the manuscript, the fluorescent light buzzing overhead doing little to alleviate the strain on her eyes. Rain lashed against the large front window of "The Written Word," turning the West Village into a blurred watercolour painting. Another manuscript. Another towering pile of hopeful prose. Another potential contender, or more likely, another addition to the ever-growing heap of polite rejections.

Eloise loved her job, she truly did. Unearthing a hidden gem, shaping a raw talent into a polished author – there was no feeling quite like it. But lately, the gems were proving elusive, buried beneath layers of self-indulgent narratives and cliché-ridden dialogue.

She sighed, taking a long sip of lukewarm coffee. The manuscript, titled "Whispers of the Forgotten Coast," was by a debut author named Bartholomew Finch. The cover letter, handwritten in swirling, almost illegible script, promised a tale of maritime mystery, ancient curses, and forbidden love. Eloise had been burned before by flowery descriptions. With a weary resolve, she turned to page one and began to read. The opening sentence, "The salt spray kissed my face, tasting of secrets and sorrow," already made her want to reach for the red pen.
