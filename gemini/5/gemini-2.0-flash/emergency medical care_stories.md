Okay, here's a story opening and setting, featuring a main character who works in emergency medical care:

**Setting:** The biting wind of a late October night whips across the Chicago River, scattering fallen leaves like a restless spirit. Reflected city lights shimmer on the inky water, a deceptive tranquility masking the urgency pulsing beneath. The scene is dominated by the imposing presence of Chicago General Hospital, its emergency room doors a perpetually revolving portal of hope and despair. The air smells faintly of antiseptic, stale coffee, and the ever-present undercurrent of fear.

**Opening:**

The shrill ring of the ambulance dispatch cut through the relative quiet of the EMS break room, jerking Dr. Evelyn Grace Harding out of her weary contemplation. She’d been staring into a lukewarm cup of black coffee, willing it to provide some semblance of energy after a brutal twelve-hour shift. Halloween weekend was always a bloodbath, a cocktail of drunken revelry and reckless abandon poured over the already overflowing cup of city life.

"Ambulance 42, respond to report of a multiple vehicle accident on Lake Shore Drive, southbound at North Avenue," the dispatcher's voice crackled over the radio. "Multiple injuries reported, possible entrapment. ETA, five minutes."

Evelyn slammed her coffee down, the sudden movement sending a spray across the already stained tabletop. Five minutes. That was barely enough time to shrug back into her fraying, but lucky, blue jacket and pray to whatever higher power might be listening that she wouldn’t have to tell another family their loved one wouldn’t be coming home. She grabbed her medical bag, the worn leather comforting against her palm, and braced herself. Another night in Chicago, another life hanging in the balance.
