The scent of industrial-strength cleaner hung heavy in the air, a sharp counterpoint to the lingering aroma of stale popcorn and nervous sweat. Outside, the marquee of the Grand Regal Theater shimmered with its nightly promise of escapism, flashing the title "Cosmic Crusaders 7: Quantum Quandary" in vibrant, almost hypnotic colors. Inside, however, reality was a sticky carpet, overflowing trash cans, and the hum of the ever-present air conditioning.

Edgar Allan Poe IV, yes, Edgar Allan Poe IV, pushed his mop bucket down the aisle, the squeak of the wheels echoing in the cavernous, now-empty theater. The last of the late-night crowd had shuffled out an hour ago, leaving behind a battlefield of spilled soda and discarded wrappers. He sighed, the weight of his name, his life, pressing down on him. He was no writer, no poet, no inheritor of the literary genius his father, Edgar Allan Poe III, had so desperately hoped for. He was a janitor. A custodian. A guardian of forgotten corners and sticky messes. And the irony of cleaning up after a movie titled "Quantum Quandary" while wrestling with his own existential one wasn't lost on him.
