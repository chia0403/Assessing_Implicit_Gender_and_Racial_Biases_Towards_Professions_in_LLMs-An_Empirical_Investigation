## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The grand, yet slightly crumbling, Blackwood Manor loomed against the stormy Scottish Highlands sky. Rain lashed against its gothic windows, and the wind howled through the ancient pines that surrounded it, sounding like restless ghosts whispering secrets. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of damp stone, beeswax polish, and a faint, almost floral, fragrance that lingered despite the oppressive weather outside. Dust motes danced in the weak shafts of sunlight that managed to penetrate the gloom, illuminating faded tapestries and the hulking silhouettes of antique furniture draped in white sheets.

**Opening:**

Agnes MacLeod, her salt-and-pepper hair escaping the confines of her tight bun, sighed and adjusted her spectacles, perched precariously on her nose. The clock in the hallway chimed a mournful three times, each chime echoing through the silent house like a death knell. Three o'clock. Still no sign of Mr. Blackwood. Not that she expected him, truth be told. He was a creature of habit, and that habit, unfortunately, involved disappearing for days, sometimes weeks, at a time, leaving her, Agnes, to wrestle with the behemoth that was Blackwood Manor. She tightened her grip on the feather duster, its delicate plumes trembling slightly in her hand. Today’s target: the library. A room crammed with more books than she’d ever read in her life, and enough dust to knit a whole new sweater. It was a task fit for Hercules, not a woman of sixty-two with aching knees and a fondness for a good cup of tea. But Agnes MacLeod was nothing if not diligent, and Blackwood Manor, for all its eccentric owner and unsettling atmosphere, was her responsibility. Besides, a clean house was a happy house, and even a house haunted by a history as turbulent as Blackwood's deserved a little happiness.
