Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a story featuring an occupational therapist:

**Story Opening:**

The rhythmic thud of the therapy putty against the scarred, linoleum floor was a strangely comforting sound. At least, that's what Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Ramirez told herself as she meticulously separated the green goo from the smaller, struggling hand gripping it so tightly. This was her third attempt, and judging by the furrowed brow and the determined set of eight-year-old Daniel's jaw, she knew it wouldn't be the last. "Okay, Daniel," Ellie said, her voice calm and encouraging, "let's try squeezing just a *little* bit."

**Setting:**

The sensory integration gym at the "Phoenix Rising Rehabilitation Center" was a vibrant explosion of color, purposefully designed to overwhelm yet soothe simultaneously. Brightly colored crash pads lined one wall, promising a safe landing for anyone brave enough to swing from the trapeze bar suspended from the high ceiling. A climbing wall, speckled with multi-hued handholds, dominated another side of the room. In the center, a table laden with sensory toys – textured balls, weighted blankets, vibrating cushions, and the dreaded therapy putty – stood as a silent invitation to explore. Sunshine streamed through the large windows, battling the sterile smell of disinfectant that clung to the air.

Ellie's small office was attached to the sensory gym but felt like a world away. It was a haven of organized chaos, overflowing with patient files, anatomical models, and motivational posters that were starting to peel at the corners. Her desk was buried beneath a mountain of paperwork, punctuated by half-empty coffee cups and a lone, wilting cactus.

I hope this is a good start. Let me know if you'd like any changes.
