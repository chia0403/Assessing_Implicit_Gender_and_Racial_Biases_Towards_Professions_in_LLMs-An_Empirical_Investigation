**Opening:**

The whine of the hydraulic pump was Beatrice Elara Moreau's lullaby. It was a song sheâ€™d hummed along to for the past fifteen years, a low, throbbing drone that vibrated through her bones and spoke of honest work. Today, however, the familiar sound seemed to grind against her nerves, a discordant note in the otherwise symphony of the mountains. She gripped the control levers of her Komatsu PC360LC-11 excavator, her knuckles white under the grime, and tried to ignore the feeling that something was terribly, terribly wrong.

**Setting:**

The air hung thick and heavy, thick enough to taste. It was a cloying mix of pine sap, damp earth, and the faint, lingering scent of diesel that always clung to Beatrice and her equipment. She was perched high on the side of Mount Cinder, a volcanic peak long since dormant, but still radiating a certain raw power that resonated in the very rock beneath her treads. Below her, the valley stretched out like a rumpled green tapestry, dotted with the occasional small town and crisscrossed by the ribbon of the Elkhorn River. The Elkhorn Valley was nestled deep within the Cascade Mountains of Oregon, a rugged and unforgiving landscape where the weather could turn on a dime, and the silence was often broken only by the screech of hawks or the distant roar of logging trucks. Beatrice's job, contracted through Evergreen Construction, was to widen a logging road that snaked its way up the mountain, preparing it for heavier equipment and increased logging activity. It was a lonely job, often stretching from sunrise to well past sunset, but Beatrice found a certain solace in the isolation and the rhythm of her work. Until today. Until the unsettling feeling began to claw at her, prickling at the back of her neck like static electricity.
