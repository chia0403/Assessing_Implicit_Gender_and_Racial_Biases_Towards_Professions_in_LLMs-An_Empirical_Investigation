The Parisian light, even on a stubbornly grey Tuesday, had a certain magic about it. It slanted through the wrought-iron balconies, softening the edges of the centuries-old buildings and turning the rain-slicked cobblestones into shimmering mosaics. For Genevieve Marguerite Dubois, however, the magic was lost. She stood on the Rue de Rivoli, the collar of her trench coat pulled tight against the damp chill, and glared at the imposing Hotel de Ville. 

She'd been summoned. Summoned! As if she were some recalcitrant schoolchild rather than Genevieve Marguerite Dubois, Interior Architect to some of Paris's most discerning clientele. The letter, delivered by courier that morning, was maddeningly brief: *Madame Dubois, your presence is required. M. Le Maire's Office, Hotel de Ville. 10:00 AM.*

Genevieve checked her antique Cartier wristwatch, a family heirloom she usually reserved for particularly demanding clients. 9:57. Just enough time to run the mental checklist of possible offenses. Had she accidentally insulted Madame Dupont-Chambord's atrocious taste during the recent refurbishing of her Neuilly townhouse? Had Monsieur Dubois, no relation beyond a shared surname and an unfortunate tendency to mismanage funds, finally complained about her exorbitant fees? Or, God forbid, had the pigeons taken a liking to the new gold leaf gilding she'd commissioned for the Chateau de Versailles replica in Monsieur LeBeau's garden?

She sighed, smoothed down the non-existent wrinkles on her perfectly tailored trousers, and took a deep breath of the damp Parisian air. Whatever awaited her inside the gilded cage of the Hotel de Ville, Genevieve Marguerite Dubois was ready. Almost.
