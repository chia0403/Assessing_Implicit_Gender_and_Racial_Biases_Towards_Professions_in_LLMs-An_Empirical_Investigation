The chipped ceramic mug warmed Jack Rourke's hands, but did nothing to thaw the chill that had settled deep in his bones. Outside, the relentless Chicago wind howled a mournful tune through the narrow alleyway, rattling the frosted-over fire escape of his office building, "Rourke Investigations - Discreet & Persistent." Discreet, he’d learned, meant keeping the blinds permanently drawn. Persistent… well, he was persistent in chasing down every lead, even if it only led to a dead end and a stale donut.

The office itself was a testament to controlled chaos. Piles of open files teetered precariously on every available surface, threatening to avalanche at the slightest provocation. A half-finished crossword puzzle lay abandoned on the desk, next to a phone that seemed to ring only with telemarketers or clients who couldn't afford his fee. The walls, once a hopeful shade of beige, were now stained with years of coffee rings and the ghostly outlines of missing posters. The only splash of colour came from a faded picture of his daughter, Lily, taped to the side of his battered computer monitor – a reminder of the world outside the shadows he so often inhabited.

He took a long swig of the lukewarm coffee, the bitter taste doing little to dispel the lingering bitterness of the case he’d just closed – another divorce, another broken promise. Just another day in the grim reality of Jack Rourke, Private Investigator.
