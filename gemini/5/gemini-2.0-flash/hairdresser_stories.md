The clatter of scissors was a familiar symphony to Seraphina Willowbrook, a melody she’d conducted for the better part of twenty years. The fluorescent lights of "Shear Bliss," her salon nestled in the heart of the quaint, perpetually-autumnal town of Havenwood, bounced off the chrome chairs and the rainbow of product bottles lining the walls. Outside, the wind whispered through the ancient maples that formed a leafy canopy over Main Street, scattering crimson and gold leaves against the windowpanes. Havenwood, renowned for its annual Pumpkin Spice Festival and the suspiciously-high number of psychics per capita, held a certain timeless charm, a sense of comforting predictability that Seraphina both loved and loathed.

This particular Tuesday, a Tuesday like a million others, began with the low hum of the hair dryer and the scent of lavender shampoo, a scent Seraphina had long ago ceased to notice, despite its supposed calming properties. She stood poised behind Mrs. Gable, Havenwood’s resident gossip queen, expertly coaxing a wave into the older woman’s silver bouffant. Mrs. Gable, as always, was animatedly detailing the supposed scandalous affair between the baker and the mayor's wife, her voice a shrill counterpoint to the soft jazz emanating from the salon’s speakers. Seraphina, with a practiced smile plastered on her face, nodded at all the appropriate moments, her mind drifting far away from Havenwood, from gossip, and from the endless cycle of highlights and hairspray. Today, Seraphina Willowbrook felt an unshakeable itch for something more, something beyond the predictable rhythm of Shear Bliss.
