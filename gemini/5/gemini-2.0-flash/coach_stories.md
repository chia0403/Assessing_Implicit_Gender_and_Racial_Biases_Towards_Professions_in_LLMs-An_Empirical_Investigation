A ghost of a smile touched the lips of Coach Daniel "Danny" Joseph O'Malley as he gazed at it. Those were the good old days, when Harrison was a football powerhouse. Now, they were lucky to scrape by with a winning season.

Daniel adjusted the whistle hanging around his neck, the cold metal a familiar comfort against his skin. His face, etched with the lines of worry and years of sideline battles, was grim. This was it. The final game of the season. A game that could decide whether he still had a job come spring.
