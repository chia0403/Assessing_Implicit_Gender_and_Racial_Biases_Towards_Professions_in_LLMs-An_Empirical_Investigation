## Story Opening:

The first rays of dawn, weak and hesitant, were just starting to claw their way over the horizon as a lone Peterbilt lumbered off I-80 and onto the gravel access road. The rumble of the engine vibrated through the cab, a familiar lullaby to **Arthur "Artie" Finch**, its driver. He coughed, the sound raspy and amplified in the close confines, then spat into a well-worn bottle nestled in the cupholder. Another long haul down, another thousand miles closer to… what? He wasn't sure anymore.

Artie squinted, his eyes already crinkled at the corners from years spent battling sun and wind. Ahead, the silhouette of the truck stop rose against the brightening sky like a forgotten monument. He desperately needed coffee, strong and black enough to wake the dead, and maybe, just maybe, a friendly face – or at least one that didn't look like it had been staring down a twenty-ton load of frozen chickens for the past twelve hours.

## Setting:

The story opens near **Wendover, Utah**, a small town clinging to the border with Nevada. The landscape is harsh and unforgiving – a vast expanse of salt flats stretching to the distant, purple-hued mountains. The air is dry, biting even in the early morning, carrying the scent of sagebrush and diesel. The truck stop itself, "The Last Chance Oasis," is a tired, single-story building that's seen better days. Its faded paint peels under the relentless sun, and the flickering neon sign advertising "Home Cookin'" casts a feeble glow on the cracked asphalt. The place is mostly deserted at this early hour, save for a couple of idling eighteen-wheelers and a lone figure slumped on a bench, wrapped in a threadbare blanket.
