Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a cosmetologist:

**Setting:**

The humid, late-afternoon air hung thick and heavy in New Orleans' French Quarter.  Sunlight, filtered through wrought-iron balconies overflowing with ferns and bougainvillea, painted dappled patterns on the cobblestone street outside "Le Fleur de Lis," a small, but meticulously kept salon. Inside, the air was cooler, carrying the scent of lavender shampoo, hairspray, and a hint of simmering ambition. The walls were painted a vibrant, cheerful yellow, adorned with framed vintage beauty posters and art deco mirrors.  A jazz playlist, low and mellow, played on a hidden speaker system.

**Opening:**

Evangeline Simone Dubois wiped a bead of sweat from her brow, leaving a faint smudge of glitter eyeshadow behind.  She glanced at the clock above the reception desk, a whimsical piece shaped like a lipstick tube: 5:57 PM.  Just enough time to tidy up before her last appointment, Madame Deveraux, arrived. Evangeline meticulously arranged her curling irons, each nestled perfectly in its holder, like instruments in a surgical tray. For Evangeline, crafting the perfect look wasn't just a job; it was an art, a science, and a way to bring a little joy into the sometimes-faded lives of her clients.  She grabbed a damp cloth, ready to wipe down her station, when the doorbell chimed, a delicate, almost tinkling sound.  Evangeline sighed.  Three minutes early. Madame Deveraux was never early. This couldn't be good.
