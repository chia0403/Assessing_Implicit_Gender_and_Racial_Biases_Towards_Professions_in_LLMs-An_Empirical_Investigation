The air hung thick and heavy, less with humidity and more with the acrid stench of burning plastic. A low, guttural roar vibrated through the concrete floor beneath Captain Evelyn "Eve" Ramirez's boots. This was no ordinary kitchen fire; this was something mean, something that had sunk its teeth deep into the gut of the abandoned warehouse on Bleecker Street.

Bleecker Street had always been a chameleon, shifting its skin with the tides of gentrification and neglect that washed over lower Manhattan. This particular stretch, just south of Houston, was in the latter phase. Vacant storefronts sported dusty windows and peeling paint, their metal gates pulled tight like grim mouths. Shadows clung to the alleyways, and the only sound besides the city's hum was the occasional scuttle of unseen things. Warehouse 31A, a crumbling brick behemoth that had once housed a textiles factory, had been boarded up for years, a haven for squatters and stray cats, a forgotten corner of a forgotten corner. Now, it was burning.

Eve tightened the strap of her helmet, the familiar weight a comforting presence in the chaos. The dancing flames painted grotesque shadows on the faces of her crew, their masks reflecting the inferno raging within the building. The warehouse groaned, a mournful lament that promised collapse. This fire was fighting back, and Eve, with years of experience etched onto her face and a knot of premonition twisting in her stomach, knew they were walking into hell.
