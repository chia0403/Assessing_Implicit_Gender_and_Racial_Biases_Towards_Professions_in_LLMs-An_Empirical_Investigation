The fluorescent lights of Mallory Peterson's cubicle hummed a monotonous song, a soundtrack to the mountain of paperwork threatening to avalanche onto her keyboard. Outside, a late afternoon November rain lashed against the windows of the prestigious law firm of Fairbanks, Blackwood & Thorne. Mallory, a paralegal with more ambition than patience, sighed, rubbing the bridge of her nose. The scent of stale coffee and cheap copy paper hung heavy in the air, a depressing blend that perfectly encapsulated her current state.

This wasn't how she envisioned her life at twenty-seven. The crisp legal pads, the precise dictation, the intellectual sparring she imagined after watching countless legal dramas...all replaced with endless document review, chasing down missing signatures, and perpetually refilling Mr. Fairbanks' ever-empty candy dish. She glanced at the clock, willing the minutes to tick faster. Just two more hours until she could escape the suffocating confines of this beige box and the stifling predictability of her life. Maybe tonight, she'd finally start that application for law school. Maybe.
