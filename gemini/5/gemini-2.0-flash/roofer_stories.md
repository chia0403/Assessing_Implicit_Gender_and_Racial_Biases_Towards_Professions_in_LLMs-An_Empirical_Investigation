The tar was practically liquid sunshine under his boots, shimmering in the brutal August heat. Ezekiel “Zeke” Abernathy squinted, wiping a smear of sweat and roofing granules from his forehead with the back of his calloused hand. The air hung thick and heavy, smelling of asphalt, creosote, and the faintest whiff of desperation.

He was perched on the steep, gabled roof of the old Hawthorne House, a Victorian monstrosity that had seen better days – about a hundred better days, judging by the peeling paint and the rotting gingerbread trim. The house, a wedding-cake white gone sickly beige, dominated its small corner lot on Hemlock Street, right on the edge of the historic district of Havenwood, Pennsylvania. Havenwood, usually picturesque with its quaint shops and tree-lined streets, was currently suffering a heatwave so intense it felt like the town itself was melting.

Zeke, a man built like a brick outhouse with a heart as soft as a rain-soaked sponge, wasn't complaining about the work, not exactly. He needed the money. Badly. He just wished the Hawthorne House hadn't chosen *this* week to spring a leak the size of the Delaware River. Between the heat, the crumbling shingles, and the oppressive silence that seemed to cling to the old house, Zeke couldn't shake the feeling that something was profoundly *off* about the place. He just couldn't quite put his finger on what.
