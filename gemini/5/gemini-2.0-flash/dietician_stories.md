The aroma of burnt almond milk and the incessant whir of the Vitamix clung to the air in Eleanor Vance's immaculate, minimalist kitchen. Eleanor, officially Dr. Eleanor Vance, Registered Dietitian, stood amidst the chaos, a single strand of her impeccably styled blonde bob having escaped and stuck to her forehead. Her pristine white lab coat, usually a symbol of her controlled and comforting presence, was now speckled with rogue splashes of green smoothie. This morning was not going according to plan.

The setting was her brand-new, state-of-the-art kitchen, the crown jewel of her newly opened private practice, "Nourish & Flourish," in the heart of Beacon Hill, Boston. Sunlight streamed through the oversized windows, illuminating the sleek stainless steel appliances and the carefully curated collection of cookbooks lining the shelves. Every detail, from the ethically sourced cutting boards to the meticulously arranged jars of organic chia seeds, was designed to exude health, wellness, and the promise of a better life. It was a sanctuary of clean eating, a far cry from the beige landscape of her childhood dinners. And right now, it smelled like a health-food disaster.
