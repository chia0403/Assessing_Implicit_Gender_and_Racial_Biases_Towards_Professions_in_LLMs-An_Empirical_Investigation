Okay, here's a story opening and setting, including the full name of the main character, who is a logger:

**Story Opening:**

The biting wind clawed at Angus MacLeod’s face, stinging his cheeks raw and red. He spat a stream of tobacco juice into the snow, the brown stain a stark contrast against the pristine white that blanketed the Olympic Peninsula. The skeletal branches of the Sitka spruces creaked ominously overhead, a mournful song that echoed the ache in his aging bones. Sixty-two years he'd wrestled with these giants, sixty-two years of the smell of sawdust and diesel clinging to his clothes, the relentless back-and-forth of the chainsaw ingrained in his muscles. He squinted up at the leviathan he was about to fell – a Douglas fir that had stood defiant against the elements for centuries, its crown scraping the gray sky.

"Alright, Betsy," he muttered, patting the worn handle of his chainsaw. "Let's give her one last dance."

**Setting:**

The story is set deep within the Olympic National Forest in western Washington State. It’s late November, bordering on December. The air is perpetually damp, heavy with the scent of pine and decaying leaves. Towering conifers – primarily Douglas fir, Sitka spruce, and Western hemlock – dominate the landscape, forming a dense, almost impenetrable canopy. Interspersed amongst the trees are patches of snow, stubbornly clinging to the shaded areas. The forest floor is a carpet of moss, ferns, and fallen logs, creating a treacherous and uneven terrain.

The specific location is a remote logging site, accessible only by a network of winding, dirt roads. The site itself is raw and scarred, a testament to the relentless power of machinery. Stumps dot the landscape like silent tombstones, and the air is thick with the lingering odor of freshly cut wood. A small, weather-beaten logging shack serves as a temporary base, offering scant protection from the elements. The nearest town, Forks (famous for its role in the Twilight novels, though that's irrelevant to Angus), is a long and isolating drive away.
