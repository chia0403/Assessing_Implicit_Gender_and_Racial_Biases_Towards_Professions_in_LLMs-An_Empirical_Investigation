## Story Opening:

The clang of hammer against chisel echoed off the granite face of Mount Cinderheart, a sound as familiar to Tobias Blackwood as his own heartbeat. Each strike was precise, economical, a practiced dance between muscle and stone. Tiny chips, glittering like captured stars, flew past his leather apron, settling on the already dust-caked ground. Tobias paused, wiping sweat from his brow with the back of his grimy hand. The midday sun beat down on him, relentless in its judgment.

He squinted, his gaze tracing the intricate design he was slowly coaxing from the stubborn rock: the sprawling branches of the ancient Whispering Willow, its leaves eternally poised to share secrets with the wind. This carving, more than any heâ€™d attempted before, felt crucial. It wasn't merely a commission; it was a plea, a testament, a prayer made manifest in stone. He sighed, the mountain wind carrying the sound away like a forgotten dream. The weight of the task, the weight of the world, settled heavy in his chest. He had to get it right. He *had* to.

## Setting:

The story is set in the remote, windswept **Blackwood Valley**, nestled in the shadow of the formidable **Mount Cinderheart**. The valley is characterized by:

*   **Quarries:** Scarred hillsides bear the marks of generations of stonecutters, revealing veins of grey granite, mottled with streaks of quartz.
*   **Whispering Willow Forest:** A dense, ancient woodland at the base of the mountain, known for its ancient, gnarled willow trees whose branches sway and rustle even in the stillest air, seemingly whispering secrets.
*   **Blackwood Village:** A small, tightly-knit community clinging to the valley floor, their lives inextricably linked to the mountain and the stone it provides. The village is a cluster of sturdy stone houses, dominated by the grand, albeit crumbling, Stonemasons Guild Hall.
*   **The Cinder River:** A swift, cold river that flows through the valley, fed by the melting snows of Mount Cinderheart. Its waters are vital for the village and power the old watermill at the edge of town.

The time period is roughly analogous to a late medieval/early renaissance era, with a strong emphasis on craftsmanship, folklore, and a deep respect for the natural world. Magic is whispered about, rumored to be tied to the stone and the Whispering Willows, but rarely openly practiced.
