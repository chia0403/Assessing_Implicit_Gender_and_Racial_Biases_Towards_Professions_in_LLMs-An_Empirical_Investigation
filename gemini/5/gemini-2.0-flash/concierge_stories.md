Okay, here's a story opening and setting, featuring a concierge named Alistair Finch:

**Setting:**

The Hotel Grand Majestic, nestled in the heart of Edinburgh's Old Town. Think gothic grandeur meets modern luxury. A soaring lobby dominated by a magnificent chandelier, polished marble floors reflecting the warm glow of the fire perpetually crackling in the massive hearth, and a hushed atmosphere that suggests both opulence and discretion. The concierge desk, a curved expanse of dark mahogany, is strategically placed to command a view of the entrance and the lifts, a silent sentinel of hospitality. The scent of beeswax polish and subtle floral arrangements hangs in the air.

**Story Opening:**

Alistair Finch, his name practically a synonym for "old money" in certain circles, adjusted the carnation in his lapel for the tenth time that morning. His crisp, dark suit, tailored on Savile Row, fit him like a second skin, and his silver hair was immaculately slicked back, emphasizing the sharpness of his features. He was the concierge of the Hotel Grand Majestic, a position he treated not just as a job, but as a calling, a sacred duty to ensure the comfort and satisfaction of the hotel's esteemed clientele.

He watched as a gust of wind, swirling through the open revolving doors, momentarily disturbed the meticulously ordered pile of pamphlets. It was a Tuesday in late October, and Edinburgh was bracing for the annual influx of tourists drawn to the city's haunted history and the promise of spooky tales. Alistair, however, was far more interested in a different kind of story – the one brewing beneath the surface of the Grand Majestic, a story that involved a missing heirloom, a reclusive countess, and a guest who checked in under a decidedly false name. He straightened, a flicker of something akin to intrigue – or perhaps trouble – in his usually placid blue eyes. Today, things were about to get interesting.
