**Story Opening:**

The air in Mrs. Evangeline "Eva" Magnolia’s kindergarten classroom always held a particular kind of magic. This morning, however, that magic felt a little…sticky. Three separate glitter explosions, an incident involving a rogue tub of glue, and a spirited debate over the proper pronunciation of "rhinoceros" had left Eva feeling less like a teacher and more like a veteran of a particularly sparkly war.

She surveyed the scene. Crumpled construction paper roses littered the floor like fallen petals. Finger-painted monsters stared down from the walls with mismatched googly eyes. And a faint, but persistent, aroma of grape juice and disappointment clung to the air.

Eva sighed, a sound like the gentle rustling of autumn leaves. She loved her job, she truly did. Five-year-olds possessed an untainted imagination, a boundless capacity for wonder, and a genuine, unapologetic love for anything covered in sprinkles. But sometimes, just sometimes, Eva dreamed of a world where glitter came in pre-measured, self-contained, non-exploding packets.

**Setting:**

The "Little Sprouts" Kindergarten classroom was nestled in the heart of Sunny Meadow Elementary School, a brightly painted brick building that hummed with the chaotic energy of learning. Eva's classroom, specifically, was a riot of color and texture. The walls were adorned with student artwork, ranging from abstract scribbles to surprisingly detailed depictions of family pets. A cozy reading nook, overflowing with picture books and stuffed animals, beckoned from one corner. At the center of the room sat a large, circular rug, stained with the remnants of countless art projects and circle time activities. Sunlight streamed in through the large windows, illuminating the dust motes dancing in the air and the mischievous glints in her students' eyes.
