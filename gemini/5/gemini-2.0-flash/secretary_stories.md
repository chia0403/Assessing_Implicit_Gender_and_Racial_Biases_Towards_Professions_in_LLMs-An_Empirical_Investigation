The stale scent of toner and lukewarm coffee hung heavy in the air of the Zenith Investments reception area. Fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous symphony, a fitting soundtrack to another Monday morning. Inside her meticulously organized cubicle, nestled between the towering ficus plant (Phil, as she’d affectionately named it) and Mr. Harrison’s ominous "Important Documents - DO NOT TOUCH" sign, sat Genevieve Eleanor Hayes, meticulously straightening a stack of interoffice memos. Genevieve, or Ginny as she was sometimes called (though she preferred Genevieve, it sounded more…professional), was a secretary at Zenith Investments, and as she straightened the fourth memo regarding updated parking regulations, she couldn’t help but feel like a particularly well-dressed cog in a very large, very uninteresting machine.
