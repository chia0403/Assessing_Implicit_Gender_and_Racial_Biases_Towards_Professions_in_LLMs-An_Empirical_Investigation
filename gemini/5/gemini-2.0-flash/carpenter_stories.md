The damp, pre-dawn air clung to the timber like a persistent lover, chilling Jedediah Bartholomew Carver to the bone despite the thick flannel shirt he wore. He coughed, the sound echoing oddly in the cavernous space of the old mill, and adjusted the headlamp perched precariously on his forehead. Dust motes, disturbed by his movement, danced in the weak beam, creating fleeting constellations around him.

The setting was the skeletal remains of the Blackwood Mill, a once-thriving lumber operation that had ground to a halt decades ago, leaving behind a legacy of rot and ruin. Located deep in the shadowed hollows of the Appalachian Mountains, the mill now stood as a testament to forgotten industry, its jagged silhouette a grim reminder of a bygone era. Weeds snaked through the cracked concrete floor, and ivy, determined and relentless, crept up the decaying walls, threatening to reclaim the entire structure. Sunlight rarely penetrated the thick canopy of trees that choked the valley, lending the space a perpetual gloom that seeped into everything, even Jedediah's spirit.

He was here, amidst the ghosts of saws and sawdust, to build. Not to revive the mill, that was beyond saving, but to carve a new life, a new beginning, out of its bones. He ran a calloused hand over the rough-hewn timbers that would form the foundation of his workshop, a small oasis of order and craft amidst the chaos. This was it. His sanctuary. His redemption. And this morning, the hard work began in earnest.
