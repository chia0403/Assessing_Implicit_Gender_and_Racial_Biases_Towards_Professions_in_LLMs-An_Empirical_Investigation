## The Flour-Dusted Truth

**Setting:** The cobblestone street outside "Sweet Surrender," a bakery tucked into a narrow alleyway in the heart of Strasbourg, France. The year is 1888, and the morning air is crisp with the scent of roasting chestnuts and anticipation. Gas lamps cast a warm, flickering glow on the snow-dusted storefront, painting the gingerbread trim and frosted windows in a romantic light. The sounds of the city – the clatter of horse-drawn carriages, the cries of market vendors, the murmur of early risers – mingle with the gentle clanging of the bakery's bell.

**Opening:**

A plume of powdered sugar billowed from the open doorway of Sweet Surrender, momentarily obscuring the figure standing within. It was **Genevieve Rose Dubois**, her face flushed from the heat of the ovens, her dark hair pulled back in a loose bun that was already escaping its confines. A faint smear of apricot jam adorned her left cheek, a testament to the early hour and the frantic pace she’d been setting since dawn. She stepped onto the cobblestones, her apron dusted with flour, the bell above the door tinkling merrily as she did. The air, thick with the promise of pain au chocolat and Kouglof, hung heavy around her, a comforting blanket against the encroaching winter chill. She took a deep breath, the sharp scent of woodsmoke and freshly baked bread filling her lungs. Another day in Strasbourg. Another day to create magic with sugar and flour. But today felt…different. A prickle of unease, as subtle as the first dusting of snow, settled in her gut. Genevieve couldn't shake the feeling that something extraordinary, perhaps even perilous, was about to unfold. The delicious aroma of baking pastries only served to highlight the contrast with the knot of anxiety tightening in her stomach.
