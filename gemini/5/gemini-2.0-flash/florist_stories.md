The bell above the door of "Petals & Prose" tinkled a merry, almost mocking tune. A gust of late October wind, smelling sharply of wet leaves and coming rain, rattled the displays of chrysanthemums and late-blooming roses. Inside, huddled behind a counter piled high with orders scribbled on pastel-colored notepads, Evangeline Beatrice Thorne shivered. Her breath puffed out in a small, visible cloud as she chewed on the end of her pen, a frown creasing her usually cheerful face.

Evangeline loved autumn, truly she did. The vibrant colors, the crisp air, the pumpkin spice lattes that had become practically mandatory. But this year, the season feltâ€¦off. Empty. Just like her order book. Sure, there were a few sympathy bouquets to be made, a smattering of birthdays, and Mrs. Gable's annual request for a truly garish arrangement for her prize-winning begonias. But the wedding season was well and truly over, the Halloween parties had dried up, and Christmas, with its frantic flurry of holly and mistletoe, still felt a lifetime away.

Petals & Prose was nestled on the corner of Elm Street and Willow Avenue in the heart of Havenwood, a town steeped in history and overflowing with charm. Think gingerbread houses painted in muted tones, cobblestone streets worn smooth by generations of foot traffic, and a town square dominated by a majestic oak tree that had witnessed more secrets than the town historian. It was a postcard come to life, a haven for artists, writers, and retirees seeking a slower pace. And Evangeline, a Havenwood native, loved it fiercely. Which made her current anxiety all the more potent. She needed a pick-me-up, a creative jolt, something to reignite the spark in her soul, and maybe, just maybe, attract a few more customers.
