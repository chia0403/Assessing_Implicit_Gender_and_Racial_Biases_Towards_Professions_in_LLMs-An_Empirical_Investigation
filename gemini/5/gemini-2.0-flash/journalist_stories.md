The flickering neon sign of the "Stardust Lounge" cast a lurid, magenta glow across the rain-slicked pavement. Isobel "Izzy" Klein, a journalist for the *Chicago Chronicle*, hunched deeper into the collar of her trench coat, the damp wool doing little to stave off the November chill that seeped into her bones. The gritty alley behind the bar reeked of stale beer, overflowing dumpsters, and something vaguely medicinal that Izzy couldn't quite place. 

This was not her usual beat. Izzy typically reported on city council meetings and human interest stories – profiles of inspiring librarians or the annual chili cook-off. But tonight, she was chasing a ghost. A ghost named Frankie "Fingers" DiMarco, a low-level mobster who'd vanished into thin air six months ago, leaving behind a trail of whispers and unanswered questions. Izzy’s editor, a gruff, old-school type named Gus, had smelled a bigger story brewing beneath the surface and, against his better judgement, tossed it her way.

The alley, tucked between the Stardust Lounge and a dilapidated building with boarded-up windows, felt suffocatingly small. Izzy knew Frankie had frequented the Stardust, and rumour had it he’d been seen arguing with someone in this very alley just hours before he disappeared. The air crackled with a nervous energy that made the hairs on the back of Izzy’s neck stand on end. She pulled out her notebook, its pages already starting to curl from the damp, and took a deep breath. Time to start digging. This alley, this city, this story – they all had secrets to tell, and Izzy Klein intended to uncover them all.
