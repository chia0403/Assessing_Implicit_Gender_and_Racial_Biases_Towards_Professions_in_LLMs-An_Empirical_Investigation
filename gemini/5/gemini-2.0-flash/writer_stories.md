The chipped enamel of the mug warmed Eleanor Ainsworth's hands, a paltry comfort against the pervasive chill of the Cornish morning. Rain lashed against the warped windowpanes of her clifftop cottage, mimicking the relentless drumbeat in her head. Inside, the cottage, affectionately nicknamed "The Wuthering Retreat," was a chaotic haven of overflowing bookshelves, crumpled drafts, and half-empty teacups. Dried lavender hung in brittle bunches from the rafters, offering a faint, floral counterpoint to the damp, earthy scent of the sea that permeated everything. Below, the treacherous slate cliffs plummeted to the churning, grey Atlantic.

Eleanor, a writer whose claim to fame rested on a single, critically acclaimed (but commercially unsuccessful) historical novel, stared out at the tempest. The blank page of her laptop glowed mockingly under the dim, flickering lamplight. Another morning, another battle against the dreaded blank page. The deadline loomed, the publisher's emails were becoming increasingly impatient, and the story, the supposed masterpiece that was going to reignite her career, remained stubbornly, frustratingly, silent. This morning, though, something felt different. A restlessness, a prickling anticipation that wasn't quite dread. Perhaps, just perhaps, the muse was finally stirring amidst the Cornish gales.
