Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a research scientist named Dr. Eleanor Vance:

**Story Opening:**

The flickering gas lamp cast dancing shadows across Dr. Eleanor Vance's cluttered workbench, making the already precarious stacks of research papers seem to breathe. A chill, not entirely dispelled by the small pot-bellied stove sputtering in the corner, settled deep in her bones. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, rattling the windows of the observatory with a ferocity that threatened to shake the very foundations. She pressed a gloved hand to her forehead, feeling the throb of a headache building behind her eyes. Three days. Three days sheâ€™d been poring over the spectral anomalies emanating from the Kepler-186f system, and she was no closer to understanding their source than she had been at the outset. A frustrated sigh escaped her lips, fogging the already smudged lens of her spectacles. Something was happening out there, something extraordinary, and she was damned if she'd let funding cuts and bureaucratic indifference bury the truth before she could uncover it.

**Setting:**

The story is set in the **High Sierra Observatory**, perched atop a remote, windswept peak in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California. It's late Autumn, bordering on early winter.

*   **Era:** A slightly alternate present day (or near future, perhaps 5-10 years ahead). Technology is slightly more advanced in terms of observational equipment and space exploration capabilities, but not drastically so.
*   **The Observatory:** A somewhat antiquated structure, built in the mid-20th century. It retains a certain historical charm but also shows its age. The main dome houses a powerful but aging reflecting telescope. The observatory also includes living quarters for a small team of scientists (though Eleanor is currently working mostly solo), a library crammed with astronomical texts, and a laboratory space (where Eleanor is currently working) filled with computers, spectrographs, and other scientific instruments.
*   **Isolation:** The observatory is intentionally isolated, accessible only by a winding, unpaved mountain road that's often impassable during heavy snow. This isolation both facilitates research and adds to the atmosphere of solitude and potential danger. The nearest town is several hours away.
*   **Atmosphere:** The overall atmosphere is one of both scientific curiosity and a growing sense of unease. The beauty of the night sky is a constant presence, but so is the feeling that something strange and potentially dangerous is lurking out there in the vastness of space. The harsh natural environment, coupled with the isolation, adds to the sense of vulnerability.
