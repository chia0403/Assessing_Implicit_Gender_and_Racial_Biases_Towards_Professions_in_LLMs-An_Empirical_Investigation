## Story Opening:

The aroma of stale coffee and anxiety hung thick in the air of the waiting room, a potent cocktail that only seemed to intensify as April 15th loomed closer. Beatrice Eleanor Hawthorne, her reading glasses perched precariously on the bridge of her nose, sighed and rubbed the tension knotting her shoulder. It was 7:48 AM, two minutes before the official opening time of Hawthorne & Finch, and already a small gaggle of taxpayers, their faces etched with varying degrees of desperation, were congregating by the door. Beatrice knew their faces. She knew their incomes, their deductions, their hopes and their fears, all distilled down to neat little numbers on forms she'd be wrestling with for the next twelve hours.

She glanced at the chipped ceramic clock above the reception desk, a relic from her late father's days running the firm. The clock ticked with an unnerving loudness, each second a countdown to the annual tax season Armageddon. Beatrice took another sip of her lukewarm coffee, the bitter taste doing little to soothe the apprehension churning in her stomach. This year felt different. This year, with all the new changes to the tax code, felt especially…ominous.
## Setting:

The setting is the office of **Hawthorne & Finch, Income Tax Specialists**, a small, family-run firm located in the slightly down-at-the-heels downtown area of a mid-sized Midwestern city, likely somewhere in Ohio or Indiana. The building itself is a two-story brick structure, its facade showing its age with faded paint and a slight list to one side. The interior is a testament to functional, if somewhat outdated, design. Think:

*   **Waiting Room:** Functional, slightly worn furniture – a couple of mismatched armchairs upholstered in a drab floral pattern, a scarred coffee table littered with outdated magazines, and a flickering fluorescent light overhead. A small, dusty bookshelf holds tax law pamphlets that haven't been updated in years.

*   **Beatrice's Office:** Cramped and overflowing with stacks of files, forms, and receipts. A mahogany desk, inherited from her father, dominates the space, its surface barely visible beneath the organized chaos. A corkboard above her desk is plastered with reminders, tax codes, and the occasional inspirational quote (usually something involving perseverance or the wonders of compound interest). The walls are painted a calming, if slightly faded, shade of green, though the effect is largely negated by the sheer volume of paperwork. A window looks out onto the bustling street below, offering a momentary escape from the suffocating confines of her work.

*   **General Atmosphere:** A pervading sense of practicality and frugality. The focus is on getting the job done efficiently, not on aesthetics. There's a quiet hum of activity, the rhythmic tapping of keyboards, the rustling of papers, and the hushed murmur of consultations. The air smells faintly of paper, toner, and the aforementioned stale coffee. Hawthorne & Finch is a place where dreams are quantified, and anxieties are meticulously documented. It's a place where Beatrice Eleanor Hawthorne tries to bring order to the financial chaos of her clients' lives.
