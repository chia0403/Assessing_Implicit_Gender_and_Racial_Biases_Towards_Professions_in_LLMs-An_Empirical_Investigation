## Story Opening and Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The clatter of pans and the hiss of steam were the morning chorus in "Le Coq Doré," and Chef Antoine Dubois conducted it all with the weary grace of a maestro nearing the end of a very long performance. He surveyed his kitchen, a kingdom built on butter and brilliance, and sighed. The lamb would be arriving late, again. Madame Dubois, his wife and the restaurant’s ever-efficient front-of-house manager, would be apoplectic. And Antoine, well, Antoine would have to conjure a culinary miracle, yet again, from whatever meager offerings remained. He pinched the bridge of his nose, the scent of rosemary clinging to his fingers a small comfort in the impending storm. Today was Brigitte Leclerc’s birthday, a woman who spent more money in a single seating than most of his staff earned in a month, and nothing, absolutely nothing, could go wrong.

**Setting:**

"Le Coq Doré" ("The Golden Rooster") sits nestled on a cobblestone street in the heart of the Marais district in Paris. The restaurant's exterior is deceptively modest: a faded blue awning shading a pair of lace-curtained windows, with hand-lettered signage in elegant cursive. Inside, however, it’s a warm and inviting haven of classic French elegance. Dark wood paneling lines the walls, adorned with antique mirrors and framed prints of pastoral scenes. Tables are draped with crisp white linen and adorned with flickering candlelight. The air hums with a convivial murmur, punctuated by the gentle clinking of silverware and the soft strains of Edith Piaf playing in the background. The kitchen, a whirlwind of organized chaos, is bathed in the harsh glare of fluorescent lights, contrasting sharply with the romantic ambiance of the dining room. It's a cramped space, but every inch is utilized, from the hanging copper pots to the meticulously organized spice racks. The scent of herbs, roasting meats, and simmering sauces hangs heavy in the air, a testament to the decades of culinary artistry that have taken place within its walls.
