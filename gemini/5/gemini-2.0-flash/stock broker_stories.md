The salt spray stung Thomas Bartholomew Davies' face as he stared out at the churning Atlantic. Not the kind of face he usually showed to the world, not the ruthlessly composed one he wore like an expensive tailored suit in the brutal concrete canyons of Manhattan. Here, on the windswept cliffs of Dingle, County Kerry, it was a face etched with weariness, the lines deepened by sleepless nights spent hunched over glowing screens, fueled by stale coffee and the constant, gnawing anxiety of managing billions of other people's money.

He’d traded the sterile, panoramic views from the 57th floor of Davies, Miller & Thorne for this – the untamed, unpredictable beauty of the Irish coast. A temporary escape, he told himself, a chance to recharge before diving back into the shark-infested waters of Wall Street. But deep down, Thomas knew it was more than just a vacation. It was a desperate attempt to recapture something he’d lost, something buried beneath layers of ambition and acquisition.

The air smelled of peat and brine, a stark contrast to the stale, recycled air of his office. Below, the waves crashed against the jagged rocks, a symphony of raw power that dwarfed even the most volatile market crashes. This was real. This was tangible. Unlike the ephemeral numbers that had consumed his life, these cliffs had stood for millennia, weathering storms far greater than any he'd encountered. And as Thomas Bartholomew Davies watched the relentless assault of the ocean, he couldn't help but wonder if he, too, could withstand the storm brewing inside him.
