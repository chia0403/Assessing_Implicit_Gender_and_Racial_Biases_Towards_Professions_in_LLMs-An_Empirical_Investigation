## Story Opening:

The air in the clinic was thick with the scent of antiseptic and simmering resentment. Dr. Genevieve Eleanor Ainsworth, registered nutritionist and purveyor of tough love, tapped her pen against the meticulously organized schedule on her desk. It was Monday morning, the day the resolutioners flooded in, their eyes wide with regret over weekend indulgences and their promises thinner than eggshell pancakes.

Genevieve sighed, a sound lost in the low hum of the fluorescent lights. She smoothed down the crisp white lab coat that always felt slightly too starched, a physical manifestation of the control she tried to maintain over her own life, and over, admittedly, the lives of her clients. Control that, she had to admit, often felt like a losing battle.

Her first appointment was running late. Again. Of course it was. It was always the ones who needed the most help who were also the most resistant to it. Genevieve glanced at the framed certifications on the wall behind her, a silent reassurance that she was, indeed, qualified and capable.

The buzzer on her intercom shrieked, startling her. "Dr. Ainsworth, Mr. Henderson is here. He says he was stuck in traffic." Brenda, her perpetually stressed receptionist, sounded less than convinced.

Genevieve closed her eyes for a brief moment. Deep breaths, Genevieve. Deep breaths. "Send him in, Brenda," she said, her voice carefully neutral. "And please make sure I have a fresh cup of green tea. I'm going to need it."

## Setting:

**Genevieve Eleanor Ainsworth's private nutrition clinic, "Nourish & Thrive," located in the affluent suburban town of Willow Creek, Connecticut.** The clinic itself is small but impeccably clean, with pale green walls and natural light streaming through large windows. The waiting area is sparsely furnished with comfortable, yet supportive, chairs and a selection of health and wellness magazines. Genevieve's office, though small, is a haven of order. Bookshelves overflow with nutrition textbooks and research papers. A large whiteboard dominates one wall, filled with meal plans, macronutrient breakdowns, and motivational quotes in Genevieve's precise handwriting. A small desk is covered with files, a sleek laptop, and a meticulously arranged collection of pens. The overall impression is one of calm, competence, and a slightly intimidating level of dedication to healthy living. Beyond the window, the manicured lawns and leafy trees of Willow Creek offer a picturesque, yet slightly suffocating, backdrop.
