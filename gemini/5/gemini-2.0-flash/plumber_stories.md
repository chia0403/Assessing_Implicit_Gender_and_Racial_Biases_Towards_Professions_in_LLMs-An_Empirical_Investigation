Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a plumber as the main character:

**Setting:**

The setting is a sweltering, late-summer afternoon in the historic French Quarter of New Orleans. The air hangs thick with humidity, laced with the scent of beignets, jasmine, and something vaguely fishy from the nearby Mississippi River.  The narrow streets are crammed with tourists, their cameras clicking relentlessly as they navigate the wrought-iron balconies and brightly colored buildings.  The specific location within the French Quarter is a creaky, three-story townhouse on Royal Street, its faded grandeur hinting at a wealthy past now slowly decaying under the relentless Louisiana sun. The townhouse belongs to a particularly eccentric jazz musician named Professor Etienne Dubois.

**Story Opening:**

Sweat trickled down Jean-Baptiste "JB" LeBeau's brow, plastering a stray strand of his dark hair to his forehead. The toolbox at his feet, overflowing with wrenches, pipes, and Teflon tape, seemed to mock him with its sheer weight. He hadn't even touched it yet, and already he felt like he'd run a marathon. The oppressive humidity of New Orleans clung to him like a shroud, even indoors.

"Mon Dieu," he muttered, pulling a faded blue bandana from his back pocket and wiping his face.  He eyed the ancient copper pipes snaking along the wall of Professor Dubois' cramped, cluttered kitchen with a mixture of apprehension and resignation. Professor Dubois' music room, a chaotic symphony of instruments and sheet music, blasted with a cacophony of what sounded like avant-garde jazz-fusion. The music was nearly as painful as the sight before him.

The professor had called in a panic, claiming water was "raining from the heavens" – JB suspected the "heavens" were actually the ceiling of the downstairs antique shop. The culprit, it seemed, was a long-neglected leak in a pipe he was supposed to repair a month ago.

JB LeBeau sighed, a sound heavy with the weight of a hundred similar jobs.  He loved New Orleans, the food, the music, the chaotic charm, but the plumbing… the plumbing was a goddamn nightmare. He braced himself and reached for his pipe wrench. This was going to be a long, hot afternoon.
