**Story Opening**

The salt-laced wind whipped Dr. Elias Thorne's words away before they could reach Clara's ears, but she didn't need to hear them. She could read the grim lines etched around his eyes, the way his mouth tightened – a sure sign of an oncoming difficult diagnosis. Clara Rodriguez, Physician's Assistant, gripped the metal railing of the observation deck tighter, the cold biting at her exposed fingers. The sprawling panorama of Port Blossom lay before them, a picturesque vista that belied the hidden struggles churning beneath the surface.

**Setting**

Port Blossom, Maine, clings stubbornly to the rocky coastline like a barnacle. It's a town steeped in maritime history, where the weathered clapboard houses huddle together against the persistent Atlantic gales. The scent of brine and lobster pots permeates the air, a constant reminder of the town's lifeblood – fishing. Tourism has begun to trickle in, drawn by the quaint charm and rugged beauty, but it hasn't yet eclipsed the hardscrabble existence of the locals. The year is 2024, and while the modern world has undeniably touched Port Blossom (evident in the gleaming SUVs parked next to rusty pickup trucks), a sense of tradition still holds strong.

Clara works at the Port Blossom Community Clinic, a modest building painted a faded blue that sits just a few blocks from the harbor. It's the only medical facility for miles, serving the year-round residents, the seasonal tourists, and the occasional stranded sailor. The clinic is always bustling, a testament to the community's reliance on its services. Dr. Thorne, the town's aging but dedicated physician, has been a fixture in Port Blossom for decades. He's seen everything, and Clara is learning from the best. The observation deck mentioned above is part of the new addition to the Community Clinic, a small attempt to modernize the facility. The observation deck looks out at the ocean and provides the best views of the town.
