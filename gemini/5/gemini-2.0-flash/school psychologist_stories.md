The aroma of burnt coffee hung thick in the air, a stark contrast to the cheerful, primary-colored posters plastered haphazardly on the walls. Ms. Eleanor Vivian Ainsworth, School Psychologist for Maplewood Elementary, wrinkled her nose and sighed. It was 7:15 AM on a Tuesday, the same day that little Timmy Henderson reliably threw his yogurt across the cafeteria, and Eleanor already felt the weight of the world pressing on her shoulders.

Maplewood Elementary itself was a squat, brick building, circa 1950s, nestled in the heart of the idyllic, and deceptively chaotic, suburban town of Oakhaven, Pennsylvania. Its playground, once a vibrant hub of children's laughter and scraped knees, now sat eerily silent, awaiting the storm of energy that would descend in just under an hour. Outside, the manicured lawns, recently sprayed with a suspicious chemical by Mr. Henderson (Timmyâ€™s father, naturally), gleamed under the pale morning sun. Eleanor, however, was firmly planted within the fluorescent-lit confines of her office, a space crammed with well-worn therapy puppets, stacks of behavioral assessment forms threatening to topple, and a half-eaten bag of stale pretzels, her constant companions in the daily trenches of childhood anxieties and burgeoning behavioral issues. She stirred another packet of artificial sweetener into her burnt coffee, braced herself, and prepared for another day in the wonderfully weird and perpetually challenging world of elementary school.
