The aroma of antiseptic and despair hung thick in the air, a noxious cocktail that Dr. Eleanor Vivian Ainsworth had grown used to inhaling over the last fifteen years. St. Jude's Hospital, a sprawling, soot-stained monolith of Victorian brick, dominated the East End of London. Its imposing facade, once a symbol of civic pride, now crumbled under the weight of poverty and neglect, much like the patients who limped, coughed, and bled through its doors.

Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Eleanor's small, cluttered office, a rhythmic drumming that mirrored the frantic beat of her own heart. Tonight, the storm seemed to amplify the anxieties that perpetually gnawed at her. Another influx of patients with consumption, another child with rickets, another desperate mother begging for a miracle she couldn't conjure. Eleanor rubbed the bridge of her nose, the ink from the patient charts staining her fingers a faint, ghostly blue. She glanced at the clock on the wall â€“ a quarter past midnight. Just another Tuesday night in the trenches.
