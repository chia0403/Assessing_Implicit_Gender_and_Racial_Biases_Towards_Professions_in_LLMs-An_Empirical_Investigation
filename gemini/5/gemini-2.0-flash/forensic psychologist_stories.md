The sterile scent of bleach and anxiety hung heavy in the air of the interview room, a combination Dr. Alistair Finch found both familiar and profoundly unsettling. Here, in the windowless heart of the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, time warped and stretched, bending to the will of desperation and delusion. The single overhead fluorescent light flickered, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to mimic the tormented movements Alistair often witnessed from across the metal table.

He adjusted the lapel of his charcoal suit, a stark contrast to the drab orange jumpsuit of the man opposite him, and leaned forward, resting his clasped hands on the cold steel surface. The fluorescent hum vibrated through the table, a constant, nerve-grating reminder of the artificiality of this encounter. He knew, logically, that this man, Damien "The Brick" Brickowski, a reputed enforcer for the notorious Molinari crime family, was as much a product of his environment as he was a calculated predator. But logic, Alistair had learned, often failed to fully account for the depths of human darkness. This interview wasn't about understanding; it was about assessing risk. About determining if Damien Brickowski was simply a ruthless thug, or something altogether moreâ€¦ broken. The setting, stark and unforgiving, felt perfectly appropriate for the task at hand.
