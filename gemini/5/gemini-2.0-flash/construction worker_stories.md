The wind howled a mournful song around the steel skeleton of what would eventually be the Zenith Tower, whipping dust devils across the unfinished concrete floors. Dust clung to everything: to the hard hat perched precariously on the head of **Daniel "Danny" O'Connell**, to the grime etched into the lines of his face, and to the rivets of the enormous iron girders he was helping to hoist into place.

The year was 2042, and Neo-Chicago was a city perpetually under construction. Gleaming skyscrapers, fueled by a relentless demand for vertical expansion, clawed at the sky, their glass and steel facades obscuring the perpetually grey Lake Michigan horizon. Below, the older, pre-Collapse infrastructure groaned under the weight of the new world; crumbling elevated trains rumbled past, belching smoke and sparks, a stark contrast to the silent, self-driving air cars zipping between the towers.

Danny, a second-generation Irish immigrant, knew this city's guts better than most. He knew the vibration in his bones when a new beam locked into place, the metallic tang of welding fumes on his tongue, the quiet satisfaction of building something that would, hopefully, outlast him. But tonight, as he stared out at the blurred cityscape through his goggles, a knot of unease tightened in his stomach. The Zenith Tower was ambitious, even for Neo-Chicago. It was too tall, too audacious, too close to the storm clouds perpetually gathering over the lake. And Danny, a man who trusted his gut more than any architect's blueprint, couldn't shake the feeling that this building was tempting fate.
