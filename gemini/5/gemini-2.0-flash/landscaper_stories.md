The late afternoon sun, a bruised peach colour, bled across the manicured lawn, painting long, skeletal shadows from the carefully pruned azaleas. For Elara Willowbrook, that was her cue to pack up. She snapped the power shears off and propped them against the back of her beat-up, but reliable, Ford Ranger. A sigh, not of weariness but of satisfaction, escaped her lips as she surveyed her work. The immaculately edged flowerbeds, the perfectly striped grass, the whimsical arrangement of moss-covered rocks - it all coalesced into the kind of curated perfection that Mrs. Abernathy, owner of this sprawling estate just outside of Asheville, North Carolina, demanded.

The Blue Ridge Mountains loomed in the distance, a hazy, purple silhouette against the darkening sky. The air, usually thick with humidity this time of year, was surprisingly crisp, hinting at the approaching autumn. This particular corner of the state, nestled in a valley carved out by the French Broad River, was a haven for artists, retirees, and those, like Elara, seeking a life a little closer to the earth. It was a far cry from the concrete jungle of Atlanta where she'd spent her childhood, but the peace sheâ€™d found here, surrounded by the scent of pine and damp earth, was worth more than all the skyscrapers in the world.

She wasn't born into landscaping; her love for it had blossomed organically, pun intended, after moving here. At first, it was just a way to make ends meet, but slowly, the rhythmic hum of the mower, the feel of rich soil beneath her fingernails, and the transformative power of her work had woven their way into her very being. Now, tending to the landscapes of Asheville was more than just a job for Elara Willowbrook; it was a calling.
