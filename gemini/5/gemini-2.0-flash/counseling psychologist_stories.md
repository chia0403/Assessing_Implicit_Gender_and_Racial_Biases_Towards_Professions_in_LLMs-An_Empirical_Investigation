The chipped mug warmed Dr. Eleanor Vivian Hayes' hands as she gazed out the window. Rain lashed against the pane, mirroring the tumultuous emotions she often navigated within the sterile, beige walls of her office. Her breath fogged the glass momentarily before dissipating, much like the fragile hope she tried to instill in her patients.

The setting was not glamorous. Eleanor's practice, "Hayes Counseling & Wellness," occupied a converted storefront in the perpetually drizzly town of Astoria, Oregon. Cobblestone streets glistened slickly outside, reflecting the muted glow of antique streetlamps. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of damp wool and lemon balm tea, a concoction Eleanor brewed religiously, convinced it soothed even the most frayed nerves. The room itself was meticulously organized, a safe haven of order in a world often defined by chaos. A plush, floral sofa sat opposite Eleanor's worn leather armchair, separated by a small, mahogany coffee table cluttered with tissues and a box of colored pencils. A framed print of Van Gogh's "Starry Night" hung crookedly on one wall, a silent testament to the beauty and complexity that could be found even in darkness.
