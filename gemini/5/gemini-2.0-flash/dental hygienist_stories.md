The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous song, a soundtrack familiar to Eleanor Beatrice Quince, dental hygienist extraordinaire. Outside, the late October wind howled a more dramatic tune, rattling the frosted windows of "Dr. Abernathy's Sparkling Smiles," a family dental practice tucked away on a quiet side street in the charming, yet perpetually damp, town of Port Blossom, Oregon. Port Blossom was the kind of place where everybody knew everybody else, and the biggest news of the week was usually Mrs. Higgins' prize-winning zucchini. Eleanor, despite moving here five years ago, still felt like a bit of an outsider, drawn in by the promise of affordable living and a slower pace, but never quite managing to fully integrate. The salty air, the constant drizzle, and the tight-knit community held her at arm's length.

Inside, however, at her pristine dental station, surrounded by gleaming instruments and the faint, sterile scent of minty toothpaste, Eleanor was in her element. The plush dental chair, currently empty and patiently waiting, was her throne. Her domain. She inhaled deeply, the scent somehow comforting, even though it was often associated with the anxious squeaks and nervous chatter of her patients. Today's first appointment was Mr. Silas Blackwood, a retired fisherman known for his impressive mustache and even more impressive collection of impacted tartar. Eleanor straightened her starched lab coat, adjusted her mask, and prepared for battle. Another day, another mouth to conquer.
