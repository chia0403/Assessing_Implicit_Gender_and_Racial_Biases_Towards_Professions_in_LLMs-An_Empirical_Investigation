## Story Opening:

The smoky haze clinging to the air inside The Rusty Mug clung to Seraphina Blue’s eyelashes too. She blinked, trying to focus on the chipped microphone stand in front of her. The low hum of conversation, the clinking of glasses, the clatter of pool balls – it was a familiar cacophony, the soundtrack to countless nights spent honing her craft in places like this. But tonight, something felt different. Maybe it was the ache in her throat, a persistent reminder of weeks on the road. Or maybe it was the unnerving feeling of being watched, a prickle on the back of her neck that made her skin crawl.

She took a slow, deliberate breath, forcing herself to ignore the weight of the unseen gaze. It was time. The band was settling into the opening chords of “Midnight Rambler,” and Seraphina had a story to tell. A story she hoped would drown out the whisper of unease, a story she hoped would fill the void that had been growing inside her for far too long. With a final, furtive glance towards the dimly lit corner booth, she closed her eyes and let the music wash over her, surrendering to the rhythm that had always been her escape.

## Setting:

The Rusty Mug was a dive bar nestled in the heart of Oakhaven, a small, forgotten town clinging to the edge of the Appalachian Mountains. The paint on the building was peeling, the neon sign flickered sporadically, and the interior smelled perpetually of stale beer and regret. Dim, mismatched light fixtures cast long shadows across the worn wooden floors, illuminating scarred tables and vinyl booths that had seen better days. A hand-painted mural depicting a faded landscape of rolling hills and a perpetually setting sun adorned one wall, adding a touch of melancholic beauty to the otherwise gritty atmosphere. In the back, a pool table dominated the space, the click and clack of the balls a constant counterpoint to the music drifting from the small, makeshift stage in the front. It wasn't glamorous, but it was real, a sanctuary for the weary souls who called Oakhaven home.
