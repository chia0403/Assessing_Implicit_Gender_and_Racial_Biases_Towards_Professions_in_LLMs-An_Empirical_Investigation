Okay, here's a story opening and setting, focusing on an animal caretaker named Eleanor Vivian Bloom:

**Opening:**

The scent of wet fur, damp earth, and something vaguely resembling tuna casserole hung heavy in the air, a potent cocktail that Eleanor Vivian Bloom had long ago grown immune to. She wrinkled her nose anyway, more out of habit than genuine aversion.  Another Tuesday, another symphony of animal need.  Outside, the rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the small animal shelter, mimicking the drumming paws and anxious meows within.  Eleanor sighed, adjusting the headlamp that kept threatening to slip off her unruly bun of grey-streaked brown hair.  She patted the side of a shivering, skeletal calico cat nestled in a makeshift bed of old towels. "Alright, Clementine," she murmured, her voice roughened with years of comforting distressed creatures. "Let's get some warmth into you, shall we? Then, perhaps a tiny bit of thatâ€¦ *delightful* tuna casserole."

**Setting:**

The setting is the "Havenwood Animal Rescue & Rehabilitation," a small, privately-funded animal shelter located on the outskirts of a rural, somewhat isolated town called Havenwood. The shelter itself is comprised of a collection of interconnected, aging buildings that have been added to over the years. The main building, which houses the reception area, a small vet exam room, and Eleanor's tiny, cluttered office, is a converted farmhouse with peeling paint and a porch that sags alarmingly.  Attached to the main building are several newer, but equally worn, structures made of corrugated iron. These house the individual kennels for dogs, cat enclosures, and makeshift spaces for other rescued animals (ranging from abandoned rabbits to injured birds).  The grounds surrounding the buildings are a mixture of mud, overgrown grass, and a few brave wildflowers that manage to thrive despite the constant trampling.  The entire property is surrounded by a dilapidated chain-link fence, a symbolic barrier against the uncaring world outside. The overall impression is one of well-intentioned chaos, desperately struggling to provide a safe haven amidst limited resources and overwhelming need. The atmosphere is perpetually damp and often cold, particularly in the autumn and winter months. The sounds are a constant cacophony of barking, meowing, chirping, and the occasional squawking from a particularly vocal parrot named Captain.
