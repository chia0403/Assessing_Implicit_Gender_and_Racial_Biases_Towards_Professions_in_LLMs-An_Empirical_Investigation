## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** A claustrophobically small, cluttered office in a converted warehouse in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The brick walls are painted a questionable shade of mustard yellow, peeling in places to reveal the raw brick beneath. Sunlight, thick with dust motes, struggles to penetrate the grime-coated window overlooking a tangle of rusty cranes and shipping containers. The air smells faintly of stale coffee, desperation, and old film stock.

**Opening:**

The third ring sent a jolt through his frayed nerves, almost making **Julian Alexander Blackwood** drop the half-eaten blueberry muffin he was desperately trying to shove into his mouth. He ignored it. Three more rings, and it would roll over to voicemail. That was the plan, anyway.

He chewed furiously, the sticky sweetness doing little to soothe the churning anxiety in his gut. He hadn't slept properly in weeks, not since the disastrous test screening of "Cosmic Echoes," the ambitious, visually stunning, but apparently utterly incomprehensible sci-fi epic that he'd poured his heart, soul, and his grandmother's inheritance into.

The phone shrilled again. Julian chewed harder, the muffin now tasting like ash. This had to be Sheila from the studio. She had a voice like nails on a chalkboard and a talent for delivering bad news with the finesse of a wrecking ball. He knew what she wanted. Another meeting. Another post-mortem. Another agonizing dissection of his vision until nothing was left but a bloody, mangled mess on the cutting room floor.

On the seventh ring, with the muffin finally swallowed, Julian lunged for the phone. He took a deep breath, bracing himself for the onslaught. "Blackwood," he barked, trying for a gruff authority that he definitely didn't feel.

"Julian? Thank God. It's me, Eleanor."

The sharp edge of panic softened, replaced by a dull ache. Eleanor. His ex-wife. What fresh hell was this?
