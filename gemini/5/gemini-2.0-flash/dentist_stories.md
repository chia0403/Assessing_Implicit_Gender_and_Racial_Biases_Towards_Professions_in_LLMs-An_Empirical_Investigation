The sterile scent of mint and disinfectant clung to the air, a familiar, almost comforting aroma for Dr. Eleanor Beatrice Albright. It was 7:58 AM, precisely two minutes before her first patient of the day, and she was already meticulously arranging her instruments on the pristine white tray. Outside, the early morning sun was painting the Victorian storefronts of Willow Creek with a golden hue, a stark contrast to the fluorescent glow of Albright Dental.

Willow Creek, nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, was a town where gossip traveled faster than wildfire and everyone knew your grandmother's maiden name. It was the kind of place where doors were rarely locked and the biggest excitement was the annual apple pie baking contest. Eleanor, with her modern techniques and big-city polish, was a bit of an anomaly in the town, a fact she was acutely aware of. But she'd inherited the practice from her late father, a beloved figure in Willow Creek, and felt a responsibility to carry on his legacy, even if her own methods were somewhat... unconventional.
