The midday sun beat down on the dusty, terracotta-tiled roof of the Casa del Sol, baking the air thick and heavy with the scent of jasmine and simmering spices.  Sweat beaded on the forehead of Dr. Eleanor Vance, Registered Dietitian, as she perched precariously on a wobbly stool, notebook balanced precariously on her knee. Below, the bustling marketplace of Oaxaca City throbbed with life â€“ a vibrant kaleidoscope of colours and sounds: the rhythmic chop of machetes slicing through mangoes, the raucous calls of vendors hawking their wares, the lilting strains of a mariachi band drifting on the breeze.  Eleanor, however, was oblivious to the chaotic beauty surrounding her.  Her focus was entirely consumed by the meticulously handwritten recipe in front of her, a family heirloom passed down through generations of Oaxacan cooks, promising the secret to a legendary mole negro.  This wasn't just another culinary adventure for Dr. Vance; this was a crucial piece of the puzzle in her latest research on the long-term health benefits of traditional Mexican diets.
