The pre-dawn chill bit at Elara Hawthorne’s cheeks as she unlocked the bakery’s heavy oak door.  A sliver of rose-tinged sky bled through the grimy London streets, painting the cobblestones in hues of apricot and lavender.  The air, still thick with the dampness of the Thames, held the promise of a crisp autumn day, but for now, it carried the sweeter, more intoxicating aroma of yeast and warm spices emanating from within Elara's haven – Hawthorne's Hearth, a tiny but beloved bakery tucked away on a quiet side street in the heart of Covent Garden.  Inside, the comforting warmth of the wood-fired oven chased away the lingering chill, its gentle hum a familiar lullaby to Elara's early morning routine.  The air was already thick with the scent of cardamom, cinnamon, and something subtly floral, the result of her overnight sourdough starter, bubbling patiently in its earthenware crock.
