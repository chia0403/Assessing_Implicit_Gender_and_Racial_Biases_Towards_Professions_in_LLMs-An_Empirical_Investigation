The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Mia”  Fitzwilliam’s auburn hair across her face as she wrestled with the recalcitrant stage door.  Rust groaned in protest with every heave, a sound almost as mournful as the empty theatre itself.  The Grand Majestic, once a glittering beacon of Broadway’s golden age, now stood hunched and weary, a skeletal frame against the bruised twilight sky.  Its once-glorious marquee, chipped and faded, promised only shadows and the whispering ghosts of forgotten triumphs. Inside, dust motes danced in the slivers of moonlight that pierced the grime-coated windows, illuminating a stage as vast and desolate as a forgotten battlefield.  Mia, however, saw not decay, but potential; a canvas waiting for her boldest strokes.  Tonight, the Grand Majestic would echo with her vision, even if only in her imagination, for the first rehearsal of her most ambitious project yet – a reimagining of "Macbeth" set against the backdrop of the roaring twenties.
