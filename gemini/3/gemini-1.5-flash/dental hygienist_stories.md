The fluorescent lights of Dr. Albright's dental practice hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Seraphina “Sera” Bellweather’s Tuesday afternoon.  The sterile scent of antiseptic mingled with the faint, lingering sweetness of spearmint toothpaste, a familiar aroma that usually calmed her.  Today, however, the scent only served to heighten the prickly tension clinging to the air like a stubborn film of plaque.  Sera, her usually crisp white uniform slightly rumpled from a rushed lunch, meticulously polished a set of gleaming dental tools, her gaze fixed on the patient's chart propped against the stainless steel counter.  It detailed the appointment:  Mr. Henderson, 67, full mouth reconstruction, known to be…difficult.  The rain hammered against the panoramic windows overlooking the grey cityscape of Manchester, mirroring the storm brewing inside Sera's stomach.
