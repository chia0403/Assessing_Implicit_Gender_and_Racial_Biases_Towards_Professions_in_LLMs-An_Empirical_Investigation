The fluorescent lights of the Mercy General Hospital lab hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* of Amelia Hernandez’s own heart.  It wasn’t the exertion of her work – drawing blood was second nature to Amelia, a practiced ballet of antiseptic wipes, tourniquets, and perfectly aimed needles.  No, the frantic rhythm emanated from a deeper source, a knot of anxiety coiled tight in her stomach that had been there since the early morning phone call.  The rain lashed against the panoramic windows overlooking the city, mirroring the storm brewing inside her.  Outside, the usually vibrant cityscape was muted by the downpour, a fitting backdrop for the grim news she'd received: a rare blood type, a desperate patient, and a dwindling supply. Amelia, Mercy General's most experienced phlebotomist, was the hospital's only hope.
