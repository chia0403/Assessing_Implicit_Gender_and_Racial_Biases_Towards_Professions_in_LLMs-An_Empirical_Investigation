The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face as he wrestled the stubborn oak plank onto the makeshift scaffolding.  Below him, the churning grey waters of the North Sea gnawed at the weathered pilings of the crumbling fishing pier, their rhythmic hiss a counterpoint to the clang of his hammer.  The air, thick with the smells of brine and drying fish, carried the distant cry of gulls and the mournful moan of the wind whistling through the skeletal remains of the pier's collapsed section.  Elias, his calloused hands blistered and raw, paused, his gaze sweeping across the desolate, windswept landscape of the Northumberland coast.  The only signs of life, besides himself and the persistent seabirds, were the handful of weather-beaten cottages clinging precariously to the cliff face like barnacles on a hull. This was his work, his life: rebuilding what the relentless sea had claimed, one splintered beam at a time.
