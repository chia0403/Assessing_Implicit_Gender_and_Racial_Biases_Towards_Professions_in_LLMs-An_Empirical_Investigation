The air hung heavy with the scent of lilies and damp earth, a perfume both cloying and comforting to  Eleanor Vance.  Rain lashed against the tall, gothic windows of "Petals & Thorns," her flower shop, a rambling Victorian building nestled on the edge of Blackwood Manorâ€™s overgrown grounds.  Inside, the shop was a riot of colour; vibrant sunflowers jostled for space with delicate orchids, their petals shimmering under the muted glow of the gas lamps.  Eleanor, her hands stained a delicate shade of ochre from handling turmeric-dyed roses, hummed a low, melancholic tune as she carefully arranged a funeral wreath, the stark white lilies a stark contrast to the deep crimson of the accompanying roses.  Outside, the storm raged, mirroring the tempest brewing within the ancient manor itself.
