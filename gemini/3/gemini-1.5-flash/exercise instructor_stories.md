The stale scent of sweat and ambition hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Amelia "Mia" Hernandez.  Fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune above the mirrored walls of "Body & Soul Fitness," reflecting a kaleidoscope of glistening skin and determined faces.  Mia, with her fiery red hair pulled back in a tight braid, surveyed her 6 AM spin class – a motley crew of bleary-eyed executives, relentlessly optimistic retirees, and a handful of twenty-somethings nursing questionable life choices and even more questionable amounts of caffeine.  The rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the stationary bikes provided a percussive soundtrack to the pre-dawn ritual, a symphony of exertion that had become the soundtrack to Mia's life for the past decade. Outside, the pre-dawn sky was still a bruised purple, a stark contrast to the vibrant energy – or at least the attempted vibrant energy – within the studio.  This was Mia's domain, her kingdom of sweat and self-improvement, and today, something felt… different.
