The biting November wind whipped Elias Thorneâ€™s hair across his face, stinging his eyes with icy rain.  He tugged his worn woolen cap lower, the frayed edges scratching at his forehead. Below, the city of Poughkeepsie sprawled like a grey, damp tapestry, its lights already twinkling against the encroaching dusk. Elias, perched precariously on the gabled roof of a Victorian mansion, felt the familiar, exhilarating sway beneath his boots.  The old shingles groaned a mournful protest under his weight, a symphony of creaking wood and whispering wind that was as familiar to him as the rhythm of his own heartbeat.  He adjusted his grip on the hammer, the cold steel a stark contrast to the rough, calloused skin of his hands, hands that had known the feel of a thousand different roofs, each with its own secrets whispered in the rustle of aging timbers and the sigh of settling mortar. Tonight, however, this particular roof held a secret that Elias felt instinctively, a secret that felt heavier than the biting wind and colder than the November rain.
