The salt spray stung Eleanor Vance's face as she wrestled the stubborn fishing boat door open.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and decaying seaweed, clawed at her lungs, a stark contrast to the sterile, antiseptic smell of the rehabilitation clinic she'd left behind just an hour ago.  The tiny, bobbing vessel, christened "The Wandering Wave," swayed precariously under the grey, brooding sky of the Outer Hebrides.  Around her, the wind howled a mournful Gaelic song, whipping the already turbulent grey-green sea into a frenzy.  Eleanor, a registered occupational therapist with a specialty in neurological rehabilitation, found herself unexpectedly far from her meticulously organized therapy room, clutching a battered toolbox filled not with assessment tools, but with repurposed fishing line, brightly coloured buoys, and a surprisingly well-preserved collection of seashells.  This wasn't exactly part of her professional development plan.
