The scent of rosemary and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Aurelia “Rella” Blackwood.  Rella, owner and sole stylist of "Shear Delight" salon, perched precariously on a wobbly stool, meticulously snipping a stray strand of auburn hair from Mrs. Periwinkle's meticulously coiffed bob.  Rain lashed against the windowpanes of her tiny, seaside shop, blurring the already hazy view of the turbulent Atlantic.  The rhythmic clatter of the waves provided a counterpoint to the snip-snip-snip of her shears, a constant, almost hypnotic soundtrack to her day. Shear Delight, nestled between a crumbling fishmonger's and a perpetually closed antique shop, was a haven of calm amidst the boisterous chaos of Seabrook's harbour, a tiny island clinging to the rugged Cornish coast.  Tonight, however, the storm outside mirrored the turmoil brewing within Rella's own heart.
