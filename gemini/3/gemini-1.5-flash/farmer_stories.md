The pre-dawn chill bit at Elias Thorne's cheeks as he wrestled the stubborn latch on the henhouse.  Mist, thick as a shroud, clung to the dew-laden fields of his farm, Willow Creek, blurring the outlines of the ancient oak trees that stood sentinel at its edge.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and the faint, sweet tang of honeysuckle, held a peculiar stillness, a quiet broken only by the distant caw of a crow and the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Elias's own boots on the packed earth path.  Willow Creek, nestled deep within the valley, was a place untouched by the hurried progress of the outside world; a place where the rhythm of life was dictated by the seasons, the sun, and the relentless demands of the land.  Elias, his breath misting in the frigid air, knew this rhythm intimately, had lived it his entire life.  This year, however, felt different. A shadow, unspoken but palpable, hung heavy over the familiar landscape.
