The chipped paint of the "Sunshine Smiles Daycare" sign flaked onto the overgrown lawn like a miniature, colourful snowstorm.  Twenty-year-old Elara Vance, her bright yellow cardigan already speckled with mysterious stains (likely a combination of grape juice and glitter glue), wrestled a recalcitrant tricycle from the grasp of a determined three-year-old named Leo.  The air hung thick with the scent of impending rain and something vaguely floral â€“ probably Mrs. Higgins' overly enthusiastic attempt at air freshening with lavender essential oil.  It was, in short, a perfectly ordinary Tuesday morning at Sunshine Smiles, a daycare centre nestled precariously between a bustling highway and a field of stubbornly unmowed wildflowers.  The building itself, a converted Victorian house, groaned under the weight of decades of tiny fingerprints and even tinier tantrums.
