The biting wind howled a mournful song across the desolate plains of Xylos, whipping snow into frenzied dervishes that stung Elias Thorne's face.  Elias, a veteran guard of the Obsidian Citadel, hunched deeper into his thick fur cloak, the collar pulled high to shield his jaw from the icy breath of the storm.  The Citadel itself, a monolithic structure of black basalt that seemed to claw its way towards the perpetually overcast sky, loomed behind him, a grim silhouette against the fading light.  Its many arrow slits, like the eyes of a slumbering beast, stared out across the unforgiving landscape, watching for any sign of the encroaching darkness – a darkness that extended far beyond the simple absence of sun.  For tonight, more than just the wind howled on the plains of Xylos; a deeper, more sinister chill settled in the hearts of the guards.  Something felt…wrong.
