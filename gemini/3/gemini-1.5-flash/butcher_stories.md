The chill wind, carrying the scent of brine and decaying seaweed, whipped around Archibald "Archie" Bartholomew's thick wool coat as he unlocked the heavy oak door to Bartholomew's Meats.

Archibald, his breath misting in the frigid air, pushed the door inward, the bell above it announcing his arrival with a weak, rusty tinkle.  Inside, the shop was a cavern of dim light and the pungent, comforting aroma of blood and iron, a smell as familiar to him as his own heartbeat.  Rows upon rows of cured meats hung from the rafters, their dark, glistening surfaces reflecting the weak glow of a single bare bulb, casting long, skeletal shadows across the worn wooden floor.  The air hung thick with the anticipation of a day’s work – a day, Archie knew, that promised to be as challenging as any storm that battered the unforgiving coast.
