The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Amy” Hernandez’s dark hair across her face as she wrestled the stretcher door shut.  Rain lashed down, turning the already slick cobblestones of Prague’s Old Town Square into a treacherous skating rink.  The gargoyles perched atop Tyn Church seemed to leer down at her, their stone faces grim against the bruised purple of the twilight sky.  The air, thick with the scent of woodsmoke and damp stone, held a different kind of chill tonight – the chill of impending mortality.  Amy, a paramedic with Prague Emergency Medical Services, adjusted the oxygen mask on her patient, a young woman clutching her side, her face ashen under the flickering gaslight.  The ornate Astronomical Clock, normally a tourist magnet, was almost invisible in the downpour, its intricate detail lost in the blurring rain.  This was not the Prague of postcard perfection; this was the Prague of hidden alleys, hurried footsteps, and desperate pleas for help – a city Amy knew intimately, both its beauty and its brutal underbelly.
