The wind, a relentless sculptor, carved patterns into the snowdrifts that piled high against the weathered fenceposts of the Bar None Ranch.  February’s grip on the Wyoming high country was icy and unforgiving, the kind of cold that seeped into your bones and settled there, a permanent chill.  Dust devils, born of frozen breath and swirling snow, danced across the vast expanse of the ranch, momentarily obscuring the skeletal silhouettes of the piñon pines clinging to the slopes.  This was Caleb "Cal" Jericho’s domain, a kingdom of frozen earth and stubborn cattle, a landscape as harsh and uncompromising as the man himself.  The biting wind whipped at his thick wool coat as he squinted into the swirling white, the only sound louder than the wind’s howl being the rhythmic *thunk-thunk-thunk* of his heavy boots against the frozen ground.
