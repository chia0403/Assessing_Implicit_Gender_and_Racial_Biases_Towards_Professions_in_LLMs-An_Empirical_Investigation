The chipped paint of Dr. Eleanor Vance's waiting room was a testament to its age, a muted floral pattern faded to the ghost of its former vibrancy.  Dust motes, illuminated by the weak afternoon sun slanting through the grimy windowpanes, danced in the quiet air.  The only sound was the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock in the corner, a metronome counting down the seconds until her next patient arrived.  Eleanor, her name etched into a tarnished brass plaque on the door, steepled her fingers, the faint scent of old paper and cinnamon from her mug clinging to the air.  Rain lashed against the panes, a relentless drumming that mirrored the anxiety churning within her. This wasn’t the usual pre-patient jitters; this was different.  This felt… foreboding.  The heavy oak door creaked open, and a figure silhouetted against the storm entered, their face obscured by the shadow of a wide-brimmed hat.  Eleanor's breath hitched.  Something about this patient felt profoundly… wrong.
