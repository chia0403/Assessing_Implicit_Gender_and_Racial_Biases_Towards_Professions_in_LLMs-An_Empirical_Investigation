The biting November wind whipped Elias Thorne’s salt-and-pepper hair across his weathered face as he wrestled with a stubborn oak branch, its leaves already brittle and brown.  The sprawling grounds of Blackwood Manor stretched before him, a tapestry of muted autumnal colours under a bruised, grey sky.  Ancient, gnarled trees clawed at the heavens, their skeletal branches reaching out like skeletal fingers against the fading light.  The manor itself, a gothic behemoth of grey stone, loomed in the distance, its countless windows like dark, unblinking eyes watching Elias's every move.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth, decaying leaves, and a faint, unsettling sweetness that Elias couldn't quite place – a perfume, perhaps, carried on the wind from some unseen source within the mansion's shadowed walls.  This was his kingdom, his domain, the acres of Blackwood Manor, and tonight, it felt more menacing than usual.
