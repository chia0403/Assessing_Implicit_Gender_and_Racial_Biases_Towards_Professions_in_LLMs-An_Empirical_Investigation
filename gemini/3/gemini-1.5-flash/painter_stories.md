The salt spray kissed Elias Thorne's face, a fine mist clinging to his paint-splattered overalls as he perched precariously on the crumbling edge of the cliff.  Below him, the churning turquoise of the Atlantic roared against the jagged teeth of the Cornish coastline, a relentless symphony that matched the tempestuous swirl of colours on his easel.  The wind, a mischievous hand, tugged at the canvas, threatening to send his latest masterpiece – a study of the tempestuous sea itself – tumbling into the hungry waves.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and wild heather, carried the distant cries of gulls, a counterpoint to the rhythmic crash of the ocean against the rocks.  This was his sanctuary, this windswept promontory overlooking the churning expanse of the sea; a place where Elias, a painter haunted by a past as stormy as the ocean before him, found a fragile peace.
