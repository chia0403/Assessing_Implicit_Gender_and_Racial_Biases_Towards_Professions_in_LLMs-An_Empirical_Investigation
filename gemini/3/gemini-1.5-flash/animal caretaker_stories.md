The biting wind whipped Amelia "Mia" Hernandez's hair across her face as she trudged through the knee-deep snow towards the clouded glass enclosure of the Arctic fox exhibit at the Willow Creek Wildlife Sanctuary.  The sanctuary, nestled deep within the whispering pines of the Cascade Mountains, was a breathtakingly beautiful place in summer, a riot of wildflowers and the chirping of unseen birds.  But winter, with its unrelenting grip, transformed it into a stark, silent wonderland, its beauty tinged with a harsher, more unforgiving edge.  Tonight, that edge felt particularly sharp.  The air hung heavy with the promise of another blizzard, and the usually vibrant, playful howls of the wolves in the distance were muted, replaced by a low, anxious whine that echoed the unease gnawing at Mia's own stomach.  She checked her watch – almost midnight – and quickened her pace, the crunch of snow under her boots a lonely counterpoint to the howling wind.  The foxes were her responsibility, and tonight, something felt wrong.
