His cramped office, barely larger than a walk-in closet, felt even smaller tonight, the damp seeping into the worn leather of his armchair, mirroring the slow drip of dread settling in his soul.  This wasn't just another missing person case; the silence from the client's family felt like a shroud, heavier than the downpour outside.
