The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s hands, a meager comfort against the biting November wind whistling through the gaps in the boarded-up windows of the abandoned theatre.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single bare bulb hanging precariously overhead, danced in the air like restless spirits.  The scent of damp plaster and forgotten dreams clung to the velvet curtains, long since faded to the colour of dried blood.  Amelia, her breath misting in the frigid air, ran a gloved finger along the cracked paint of the proscenium arch, tracing the ghosts of countless performances – triumphs and failures alike – that had once graced this hallowed, now derelict, space. This was the Nightingale Theatre, once a jewel of the city, now her sanctuary, her rehearsal space, and, tonight, the stage for a very private concert.
