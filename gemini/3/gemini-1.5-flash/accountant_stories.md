The fluorescent lights of KPMG hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the frantic tapping of Amelia Katherine Finch’s fingers on her keyboard.  It was 2:17 AM, the air thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, a familiar aroma in the bowels of the London office during tax season.  Amelia, or Amy as her friends – few and far between these days – called her, squinted at the spreadsheet illuminating her face with a sickly green glow.  Rows and columns of numbers, a labyrinthine landscape of debits and credits, stretched before her, a financial Everest she was determined to conquer before sunrise. Outside, the city thrummed with a muted energy, a stark contrast to the sterile, almost sepulchral quiet of the office, where only the rhythmic click-clack of keyboards and the occasional sigh broke the silence.  This year, however, the silence was punctuated by the insistent, low thrum of anxiety vibrating in Amy’s chest.  This wasn’t just another tax return; this was the Harding Group account, and something felt…wrong.
