The chipped paint of the "Welcome to Ms. Eleanor Vance's Third Grade" sign flaked onto the dusty windowsill, mirroring the slow disintegration of Eleanor Vance's meticulously planned lesson plan.  Rain lashed against the panes of Oakwood Elementary, a relentless drumming that seemed to echo the frantic thump-thump-thump of her own heart.  The usually cheerful yellow walls of Room 2B felt oppressive under the grey gloom of the late October afternoon, the vibrant student artwork – carefully categorized by theme and meticulously labelled – looking muted and forlorn.  Even the scent of crayons and glue, usually a comforting aroma, felt heavy, a cloying sweetness that did little to mask the underlying anxiety clinging to the air like damp wool.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune, promising a long, cold night.  Inside, Eleanor Vance wrestled with a problem far more complex than long division or the intricacies of the water cycle.  This problem wore tiny shoes and carried a lunchbox decorated with sparkly unicorns.
