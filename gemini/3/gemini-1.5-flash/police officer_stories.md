The salt spray stung Officer Anya Petrova's face as she wrestled the battered patrol car onto the narrow, winding road.  The relentless Atlantic wind howled a mournful dirge, whipping her dark braid across her cheek.  Below, the cliffs of Cornwall plummeted into a churning, grey sea, the jagged rocks a treacherous graveyard for unsuspecting vessels.  The air, thick with the smell of brine and seaweed, carried a sharper, metallic tang â€“ the scent of blood.  It clung to the damp, wind-lashed air like a shroud, a grim prelude to the call that had dragged Anya away from the relative warmth of her tiny cottage and into the teeth of this brutal November storm.  The flickering blue and red lights of her vehicle cut fleetingly through the gloom, illuminating only the treacherous path ahead, leaving the vast, menacing ocean largely cloaked in shadow.  This was her beat, the wild, unforgiving coastline of Porthcurno, and tonight, it felt especially menacing.
