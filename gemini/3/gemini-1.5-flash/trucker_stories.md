The diesel groaned, a low, mournful sound that vibrated through Ezekiel "Zeke" Stone's worn leather boots.  He sat hunched over the steering wheel of his eighteen-wheeler, the "Desert Bloom," its paint job faded and chipped like sun-baked desert varnish.  The cab smelled of stale coffee, cheap cigarettes, and the faint, lingering scent of pine air freshener, a feeble attempt to mask the pervasive aroma of sweat and diesel fuel.  Outside, the Nevada sun beat down on the endless ribbon of Interstate 80, the shimmering asphalt stretching towards the hazy horizon like a mirage.  The only sound louder than the engine's rumble was the incessant whine of the wind whistling through the cracks in the aging windshield – a soundtrack to Zeke’s solitary journey across the vast, unforgiving landscape.  He’d been driving for twelve hours, the sun a fiery eye watching his every move, the landscape unchanging, a monotonous tapestry of scrub brush and sand.  This wasn't just a job for Zeke; it was a life, a solitary existence etched into the lines on his face as deeply as the Nevada sun had etched itself into the paint of his truck.  Tonight, however, felt different.  A prickle of unease, sharp as a cactus spine, ran down his spine.
