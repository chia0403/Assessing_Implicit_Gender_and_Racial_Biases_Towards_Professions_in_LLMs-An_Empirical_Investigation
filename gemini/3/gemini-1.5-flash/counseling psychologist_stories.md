The chipped paint of Dr. Eleanor Vance’s waiting room offered little solace to the anxious shuffling of feet outside.  Rain lashed against the tall, gothic windows of her Victorian-era office, mirroring the tempestuous emotions often swirling within her clients.  The scent of damp earth and old leather – a peculiar blend of the outside storm and the aged furniture within – hung heavy in the air.  Eleanor, her auburn hair pulled back in a practical bun, sat at her oak desk, the rhythmic tapping of her pen against a notepad a counterpoint to the drumming rain.  A half-finished cup of chamomile tea sat cooling beside a stack of case files, each one a testament to the fragile human hearts she endeavored to mend.  The flickering gaslight above cast long shadows across the room, illuminating the dust motes dancing in the air, each one a tiny, fleeting echo of the lives she touched.  Tonight, however, a particularly heavy storm was brewing; a storm that threatened to engulf not just her client, but perhaps, Eleanor herself.
