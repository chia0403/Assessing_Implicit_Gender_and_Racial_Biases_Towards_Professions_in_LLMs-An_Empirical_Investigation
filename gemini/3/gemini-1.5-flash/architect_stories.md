The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Mia” Hernandez’s charcoal-grey coat around her legs as she surveyed the derelict Victorian mansion.  Rain, a relentless drizzle that had been falling for days, plastered her dark hair to her forehead, clinging to the collar of her expensive but practical wool coat.  The skeletal remains of the once-grand building, perched precariously on a cliff overlooking the churning grey expanse of the Atlantic, seemed to defy gravity itself.  Each broken pane of glass in the multitude of gothic windows was a tiny, glittering eye staring blankly out at the stormy sea.  Seagulls, their cries swallowed by the wind’s howl, circled overhead, their white against the bruised purple sky a stark contrast to the decaying grandeur below.  This was Blackwood Manor, her latest, and possibly most challenging, commission.  The salty air stung Mia's eyes, but she didn't flinch. This was more than just a renovation; it was a resurrection, a fight against the relentless erosion of time and the unforgiving sea.
