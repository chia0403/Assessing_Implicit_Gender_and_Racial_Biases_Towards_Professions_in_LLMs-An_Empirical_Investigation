The scent of old varnish and forgotten dreams hung heavy in the air, a cloying perfume clinging to the dust motes dancing in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom of the Blackwood Manor library.  Amelia Grace Hawthorne, renowned for her ability to coax beauty from even the most dilapidated spaces, inhaled deeply, the familiar tang sharpening her senses.  Dust motes, she mused, were merely tiny, glittering opportunities for transformation.  Amelia, however, felt a prickle of unease beneath the familiar thrill of a new challenge. This wasn't the charmingly neglected Victorian she usually tackled; Blackwood Manor wasâ€¦different.  Its silence felt less like peaceful slumber and more like a suppressed scream. The air itself seemed to vibrate with a weight unseen, a history both opulent and deeply unsettling.
