He coughed, the sound swallowed by the roar of the inferno consuming the old Victorian mansion on Ashworth Hill.  Flames, a malevolent orange ballet, licked at the gables, their hungry dance reflected in the shattered windows.  Rain, a pathetic counterpoint to the blaze, lashed down, turning the surrounding lawns into a churning mud slick.  The wind, however, was a cruel accomplice, whipping the flames higher, driving them deeper into the heart of the burning structure.  Elias, his face streaked with soot and sweat, gripped his axe, the familiar weight a small comfort in the chaos. This wasn't just another fire; the whispers on the radio had spoken of a potential victim trapped within – a child, they said.  And the chilling silence from the building, broken only by the crackle of burning timbers, suggested those whispers might be true.
