The chipped paint of the waiting room’s floral wallpaper peeled back like sunburnt skin, revealing a sickly yellow beneath.  Dr. Eleanor Vance, a registered dietitian and certified nutritionist, tapped a perfectly manicured fingernail against the worn armrest of her chair, the rhythmic tick-tock a counterpoint to the erratic whirring of the ancient air conditioner.  The air hung heavy with the scent of antiseptic and something vaguely floral – perhaps lilies, fighting a losing battle against the pervasive aroma of stale coffee.  Eleanor’s clinic, nestled in the shadow of a crumbling Victorian building on the wrong side of Elm Street in the perpetually grey town of Havenwood, was, to put it mildly, unassuming.  But it was hers, and within its peeling walls, she’d helped countless residents wrestle their way to better health, one carefully curated meal plan at a time. Today, however, felt different.  A nervous energy, sharp and unfamiliar, pricked at the edges of her usual calm professional demeanor.  This wasn't just another appointment; this was Silas Blackwood.
