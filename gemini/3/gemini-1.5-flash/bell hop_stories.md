The brass spittoon gleamed under the dim, gaslit chandelier of the Grand Majestic Hotel, reflecting the weary slump of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's shoulders.  Barty, a bellhop whose uniform – once crisp navy blue – now bore the faint, but persistent, aroma of stale cigar smoke and spilled champagne, sighed.  The air hung thick with the scent of lilies, expensive perfume, and a subtle undercurrent of desperation – the usual bouquet of the Grand Majestic's late-night clientele. Rain lashed against the arched windows overlooking the rain-slicked streets of 1920s Chicago, each gust a mournful echo of the city's own restless heart.  Inside, however, the Grand Majestic hummed with a different kind of energy: a low thrum of illicit deals whispered in hushed corners, the clinking of ice in crystal glasses, and the relentless, rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Barty's own worn leather-soled shoes as he navigated the labyrinthine corridors.  Tonight, though, the usual hum felt heavier, charged with an almost palpable sense of foreboding.
