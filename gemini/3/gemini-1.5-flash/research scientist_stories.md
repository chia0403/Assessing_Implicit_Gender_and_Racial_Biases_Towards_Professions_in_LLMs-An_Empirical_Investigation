The biting Antarctic wind howled like a banshee, tearing at the reinforced fabric of Dr. Aris Thorneâ€™s parka.  He hunched deeper into the swirling snow, the breath misting from his lips a fleeting white cloud against the vast, glacial expanse.  The Vostok Station, a lonely outpost clinging precariously to the frozen heart of the continent, was a stark and unforgiving beauty.  The sky, a bruised purple merging with an icy, almost luminous blue, offered no solace, only a relentless, oppressive weight.  Aris, his face partially obscured by a breath-fogged goggles, adjusted his thermal gloves, the icy grip of the metal chilling him to the bone even through the layers of protective gear.  His research, a desperate gamble to unlock the secrets buried within the ancient ice, felt as isolating and unforgiving as the landscape itself.  Tonight, however, the isolation felt less like scientific detachment and more like a suffocating dread.  Something was different. Something was *wrong*.
