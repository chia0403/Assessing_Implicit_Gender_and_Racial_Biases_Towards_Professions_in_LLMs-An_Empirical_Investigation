The rusty swing sign creaked a mournful tune in the humid Charleston air, its faded lettering barely proclaiming "Bartholomew "Barty" Higgins, Barber."  Barty himself sat perched on a worn leather stool behind the chipped Formica countertop of his shop, the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of his shears a counterpoint to the cicadas' incessant drone. Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight slicing through the grimy window, illuminating the faded floral wallpaper and the collection of chipped ceramic mugs lining the shelf.  The air hung thick with the scent of Bay Rum, stale coffee, and the lingering memory of a thousand close shaves.  Outside, the cobblestones of Rainbow Row shimmered under the South Carolina sun, a picturesque postcard scene that contrasted sharply with the slightly neglected, almost melancholic atmosphere within Bartholomew Higgins's modest barbershop.
