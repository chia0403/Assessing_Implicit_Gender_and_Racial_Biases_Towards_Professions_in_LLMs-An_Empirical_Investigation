The chipped porcelain sink, stained a sickly yellow from years of spilled polish remover, hummed a mournful tune under the relentless drip, drip, drip of a leaky faucet.  The air in Esmeralda "Esme" Valentine's nail salon, "Esme's Exquisite Nails," hung thick with the cloying sweetness of lilac cuticle oil and the faint, metallic tang of blood – a testament to the occasional nick suffered by Esme's less-than-steady hand.  Dust motes, illuminated by the harsh fluorescent lights, danced in the stifling heat of the July afternoon.  Outside, the relentless Houston sun beat down on the peeling paint of the building, a stark contrast to the cool, pale pink walls of Esme's tiny kingdom, a space crammed with mismatched chairs, chipped lacquer bottles, and a bewildering array of nail art supplies.  Today, however, the usually vibrant salon felt strangely quiet, the only sound the persistent drip, drip, drip and the frantic thump-thump-thump of Esme’s own heart.  Something was wrong. Very wrong.
