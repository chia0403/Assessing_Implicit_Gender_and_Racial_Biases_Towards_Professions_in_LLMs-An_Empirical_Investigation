The scent of vanilla and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a cloying perfume that clung to the plush velvet curtains and the antique vanity mirror in Aurelia "Auri" Davenport's salon.  Rain lashed against the leaded-glass windows of "Shear Perfection," a quaint, almost anachronistic establishment tucked away on a cobbled side street in the historic district of Charleston, South Carolina.  The gas lamps outside flickered, casting long, dancing shadows that played tricks on Auri's already weary eyes.  It was almost midnight, far past her usual closing time, yet Auri remained, surrounded by the remnants of the day's chaos: stray bobby pins scattered like fallen stars across the mahogany floor, a half-empty bottle of champagne chilling forlornly in an ice bucket, and the faint echo of laughter and whispered secrets still clinging to the air.  Outside, the storm raged, a fitting backdrop to the tempest brewing inside her.
