The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful song around Captain Evelyn "Evie" Reedâ€™s battered Cessna 185, its icy breath frosting the cockpit windows.  Below, the Chugach Mountains hunched like slumbering giants, their snow-capped peaks shrouded in a swirling veil of mist that clung stubbornly to the jagged peaks. The air, thin and crisp, tasted of pine and impending snow.  Evie, her breath misting before her, checked her instruments one last time, the faint glow of the panel reflecting in her determined grey eyes.  The radio crackled with static, a counterpoint to the rhythmic thrum of the engine, a faithful beast that had carried her through countless treacherous Alaskan skies.  Her mission tonight: a solo, emergency medical evacuation from a remote logging camp nestled deep within the unforgiving wilderness.  The weight of responsibility, as heavy as the snow accumulating on the wings, settled on her shoulders.
