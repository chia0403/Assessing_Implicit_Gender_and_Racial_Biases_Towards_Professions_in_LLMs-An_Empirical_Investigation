The scent of dried paint and slightly-too-sweet applesauce hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Ms. Eleanor Vance.  It clung to her cardigan, a faded lilac that had witnessed countless crayon masterpieces and more than a few unfortunate spills of juice boxes.  Outside, the late October wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the windows of Room 2B at Willow Creek Elementary, a charmingly dilapidated building that seemed to lean precariously towards the encroaching woods.  Inside, however, a kaleidoscope of chaos reigned â€“ a controlled, meticulously-managed chaos, of course.  Tiny humans, barely bigger than the alphabet blocks scattered across the brightly coloured rug, buzzed with the energy of a hummingbird hive.  Eleanor, her hair pulled back in a practical bun that had seen better days, surveyed her kingdom with a practiced eye, a faint smile playing on her lips.  Today was the day of the annual Halloween parade, and anticipation thrummed through the room like a second heartbeat.
