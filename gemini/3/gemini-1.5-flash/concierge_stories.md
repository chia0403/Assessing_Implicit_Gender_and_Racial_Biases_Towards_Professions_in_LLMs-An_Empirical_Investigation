The brass nameplate gleamed under the muted halogen lights of the lobby:  *Aurelian "Auri" Moreau, Concierge*.  Auri Moreau adjusted the crisp folds of his midnight-blue uniform, a silent sigh escaping his lips as he surveyed the opulent, yet somehow sterile, expanse of the Grand Majestic Hotel.  Rain lashed against the vast arched windows, a relentless drumming that mirrored the persistent thrum of anxiety in his chest.  The Grand Majestic, a monument to bygone Gilded Age glamour, perched precariously on the edge of the perpetually rain-slicked, cobbled streets of Prague, its aged stone facade a stark contrast to the sleek, modern glass towers rising like obsidian teeth around it.  Tonight, however, the usual hushed elegance felt brittle, strained, like a priceless porcelain vase teetering on the brink of shattering.  A chilling premonition, as sharp and cold as the November wind whistling through the cracks in the ancient building, settled heavily on Auri's shoulders.  He knew, with a certainty that chilled him to the bone, that this night would be anything but ordinary.
