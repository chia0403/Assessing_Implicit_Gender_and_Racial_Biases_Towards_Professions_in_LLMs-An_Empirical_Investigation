The scent of lavender and old parchment hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the biting November wind howling outside.  Rain lashed against the leaded-glass windows of  "Stitches in Time," a tiny, cluttered shop nestled on a cobbled lane in the ancient town of Oakhaven.

Amidst the colourful chaos, Aurelia Josephine Thorne, her fingers stained a delicate purple from dye, meticulously stitched a tiny pearl onto the intricate bodice of a wedding gown.  The silence, broken only by the rhythmic click of her needle and the distant clang of the town blacksmith, was her sanctuary, a haven where the ghosts of past creations whispered encouragement.
