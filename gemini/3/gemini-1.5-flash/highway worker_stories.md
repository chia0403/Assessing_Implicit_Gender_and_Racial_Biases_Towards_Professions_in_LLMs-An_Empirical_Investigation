The asphalt shimmered, a heat-haze mirage rising from the black ribbon of Interstate 40 that sliced through the New Mexico desert.  Cicadas buzzed a relentless symphony, their song a counterpoint to the rhythmic thrum of Dale Bartholomew’s jackhammer.  Dust, fine as powdered talc, coated everything – his worn work boots, the faded orange safety vest clinging to his broad shoulders, even the sweat beading on his forehead under the brim of his sweat-stained hat.  Dale, a man carved from sun-baked earth and seasoned by years spent battling the unforgiving elements, barely registered the discomfort.  He’d seen worse summers, and he knew many more lay ahead.  The endless expanse of shimmering desert stretched before him, broken only by the occasional tumbleweed and the distant, hazy silhouettes of mesas. This was his kingdom, a kingdom of cracked pavement, shimmering heat, and the quiet, unwavering drone of the highway.
