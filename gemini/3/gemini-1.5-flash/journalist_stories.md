The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s hair across her face, stinging her cheeks a vibrant crimson that clashed spectacularly with the drab grey of the Edinburgh sky.  Rain, a relentless drizzle that had been falling since dawn, plastered her trench coat to her thin frame.

She stood on the cobbled street outside the imposing gothic façade of Blackwood Manor, its stone gargoyles leering down at her from the shadowed eaves, seemingly mocking her shivering form.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and something else…something faintly metallic, like old blood.  This wasn't just another dreary Edinburgh evening; something felt profoundly wrong, something that gnawed at the edges of her usually sharp intuition.
