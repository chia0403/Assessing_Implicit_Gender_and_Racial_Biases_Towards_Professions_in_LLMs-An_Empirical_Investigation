The scent of rosemary and sandalwood hung heavy in the air, a comforting perfume clinging to the worn velvet chairs and the chipped porcelain sink in Amelia Grace Hawthorne's tiny salon.  Amelia, a woman whose age was as carefully concealed as the grey hairs she expertly snipped from her clients’ heads, hummed a low, melancholic tune as she swept stray strands of auburn hair from her workstation.

The only illumination came from a single, flickering gas lamp outside, casting long, dancing shadows across the uneven flagstones and painting the inside of the salon in a warm, amber glow.  Tonight, however, Amelia felt anything but warm. A chill, deeper than the autumn wind whistling through the gaps in the window frame, settled in her bones.  She’d been expecting him.
