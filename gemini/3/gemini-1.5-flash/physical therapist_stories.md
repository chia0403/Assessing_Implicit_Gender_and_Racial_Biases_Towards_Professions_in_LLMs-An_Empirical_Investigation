The salt spray kissed Dr. Eleanor Vance's face as she navigated the treacherous, wind-whipped path leading to the isolated lighthouse.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and seaweed, whipped her dark hair across her eyes, momentarily obscuring the rugged beauty of the Cornish coastline.  Below, the Atlantic churned a restless grey, its relentless waves crashing against the jagged rocks with a fury that mirrored the storm brewing inside her.  Eleanor, a physical therapist with hands as skilled as a surgeon's and a heart as weathered as the cliffs themselves, hadn't come to this remote outpost for a holiday.  She'd come for Silas Blackwood, a recluse with a shattered past and a body broken beyond repair, or so the local doctor claimed.  The lighthouse, perched precariously on its granite throne, stood as a silent sentinel, a lonely beacon against the encroaching darkness â€“ both of the storm and of Silas's soul.
