Okay, here's a story opening with a setting and main character:

**Story Opening:**

The scent of antiseptic and the rhythmic whoosh of the automatic doors opening and closing was Amelia Grace Carter's constant companion. It was the olfactory soundtrack to her life at Mercy General Hospital, a symphony of the mundane punctuated by the occasional discordant scream or hurried code announcement. Today, however, felt different. The usual pre-dawn gloom that blanketed the city outside seemed to have seeped into the very bones of the hospital, weighing down the fluorescent lights and dampening the usual hum of early morning activity. Amelia, already on her second cup of lukewarm coffee, felt a prickle of unease crawling up her spine. Maybe it was the full moon, maybe it was just the lingering dread from that particularly gruesome consult she'd overheard last night, but something told her this shift was going to be anything but ordinary. The way Sister Mary Agnes, usually a beacon of cheerful efficiency, had given her a distinctly *grim* nod as she passed in the hallway this morning was not helping her anxiety.

**Setting:**

The story opens in the pre-dawn hours (around 5:00 AM) at Mercy General Hospital, a sprawling, somewhat outdated institution in the heart of a bustling, nameless city. The specific location at the opening is likely the phlebotomy lab or a nearby hallway, indicated by the scent of antiseptic and the mention of Sister Mary Agnes, a nurse. The atmosphere is described as gloomy and uneasy, despite the usual hustle and bustle of a hospital.

**Main Character:**

*   **Full Name:** Amelia Grace Carter
*   **Occupation:** Phlebotomist (someone who draws blood for medical testing)
*   **Implied Personality (from the opening):** Possibly a bit anxious, perceptive (aware of the shift in the atmosphere), and perhaps slightly cynical (indicated by the lukewarm coffee and the description of the hospital sounds as a "symphony of the mundane"). She seems observant, noticing small details like Sister Mary Agnes's grim nod.
