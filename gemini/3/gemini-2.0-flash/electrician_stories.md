The biting wind, smelling of salt and something metallic that could only be rust and impending doom, whipped around Elias Theodore Vance as he clung to the platform, seventy feet above the churning grey waters of the North Sea. Elias pulled his thick woolen beanie further down, the frayed edge tickling his eyebrow. The platform, a skeletal finger of the Eldridge Offshore Wind Farm’s alpha cluster, groaned under the relentless assault of the waves.

He was on ‘Helios-7,’ one of the furthest turbines from the central hub, a place where the weather always seemed to be ten percent worse than everywhere else. He hated it. Not the height, not the wind, not even the inherent danger; he hated the isolation. Up here, perched on the edge of the world, you were intensely aware of your own fragility, a tiny cog in a monstrous machine churning out clean, green energy.

His calloused fingers, stained with grease and the faint residue of copper wiring, danced over the diagnostic panel. The turbine, usually a graceful, silent giant, had stuttered to a halt hours ago, throwing the network into a minor tizzy. Back at Eldridge Central, they were already breathing down his neck, demanding answers, demanding uptime. Elias understood. This wasn't just about electricity; it was about contracts, profit margins, and the carefully cultivated image of green, renewable energy.

He just wished they'd understand that fixing a short circuit in a damp nacelle, while battling gale-force winds and seasickness, wasn't exactly a walk in the park. Helios-7 was proving to be a particularly stubborn beast.
