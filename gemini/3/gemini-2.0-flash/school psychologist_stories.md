## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The fluorescent lights of Meadow Creek Elementary hummed a monotonous tune, a stark contrast to the chaotic symphony of children’s voices echoing from the nearby playground. The air hung thick with the scent of industrial-strength cleaner and the faint, lingering aroma of yesterday's cafeteria lunch – a questionable shepherd's pie. Outside, the vibrant tapestry of autumn painted the trees in fiery hues of red and gold, a beauty completely lost on the harried teachers and restless students trapped within the building's brick walls.

**Opening:**

Dr. Eleanor Vance, a woman perpetually battling both the clock and the creeping sense of inadequacy that plagued most school psychologists, sighed as she watched a small, crumpled paper airplane nose-dive into the overflowing recycling bin. The target, no doubt, was the perpetually scowling face of Mrs. Crabtree, the notoriously strict third-grade teacher. Eleanor pinched the bridge of her nose, the faint throbbing in her temples a familiar warning sign. It was only 9:17 AM, and she'd already fielded a tearful meltdown over a missing purple crayon, mediated a territorial dispute over the swingset, and scheduled an emergency meeting with the parents of a child who’d allegedly bitten another student during circle time. Another Tuesday. Another day in the delightful trenches of elementary school psychology. Today, though, felt different. There was an undercurrent of anxiety, a low hum of unease that vibrated beneath the surface of the usual chaos. Eleanor couldn't quite put her finger on it, but something felt…off.
