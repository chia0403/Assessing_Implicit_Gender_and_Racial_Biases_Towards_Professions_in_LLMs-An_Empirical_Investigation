The clatter of stainless steel instruments on the tray was a symphony of anxiety for most patients, but for Dr. Alistair Theodore Plumtree, it was the gentle percussion that ushered in another day in the chair. Sunlight, diluted by the frosted glass of the arched windows, streamed into his practice at "The Plumtree Dental Clinic," a cozy brick building nestled amongst the antique shops and tea rooms of Meadowbrook Village. Alistair, his crisply starched white coat unblemished, straightened his tie, a vibrant paisley that was his small rebellion against the sterile environment. He glanced at the handwritten schedule taped to the wall beside his desk, the familiar script of his receptionist, Mrs. Higgins, a woman who could soothe even the most petrified patient with her voice alone. Today was a mixed bag: Mrs. Gable for a routine cleaning, young Timmy Perkins for a dreaded filling, and, finally, the new patient - a Mr. Silas Blackwood, referred by Dr. Abernathy from the city. Alistair adjusted his spectacles, a small frown creasing his forehead. Blackwood...the name felt vaguely familiar, a prickle of unease that danced along the back of his neck. He hoped, for his sake and Mr. Blackwood's, that it was just coincidence. The last thing Alistair Theodore Plumtree needed was a complication in his quiet, meticulously ordered life.
