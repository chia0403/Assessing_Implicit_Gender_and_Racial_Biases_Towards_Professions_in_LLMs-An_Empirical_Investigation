## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The late afternoon sun bled hues of apricot and rose across the cobblestone streets of Beacon’s Landing, a quaint seaside town nestled on the Oregon coast. Salt-laced air mingled with the intoxicating fragrance of freshly cut blooms emanating from "Petals & Prose," a small flower shop overflowing with verdant foliage and vibrant color. Inside, sunlight glinted off the antique watering cans and danced on the glass vases brimming with lilies, roses, and exotic orchids. The gentle chime of a ship’s bell hanging above the door announced the arrival of a new customer.

**Story Opening:**

Eliza Meadowbrook glanced up from meticulously arranging a bouquet of vibrant sunflowers, a practiced frown etching itself onto her forehead. It was always the same time of day. The tourists, flushed from a day of whale watching and fudge-fueled adventures, would filter in, their enthusiasm as wilted as the discount daisies sold down the street at "Coastal Treasures." Eliza, however, prided herself on the quality of her blooms and the artistry of her arrangements. She wouldn't compromise, even if it meant the day ended with more petals swept than dollars earned.

"Good afternoon," she said, her voice warm and genuine, a stark contrast to the sharp glint in her emerald eyes. "What can I help you with today?"
