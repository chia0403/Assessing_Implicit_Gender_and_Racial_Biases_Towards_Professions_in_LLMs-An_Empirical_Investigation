The biting wind, smelling of pine and the promise of snow, whipped at the frayed edges of Jasper Thorne's worn leather apron. He squinted, pushing a stray lock of sawdust-dusted grey hair from his eyes. The November sky over Havenwood was a bruised purple, threatening to unleash a blizzard that would trap him and his tools in his small workshop for days.

Jasper’s workshop, affectionately (and sometimes not so affectionately) referred to as “The Splinter Box” by the townsfolk, was a ramshackle affair perched on the edge of Havenwood's sprawling forest. It was a building born more of necessity and stubbornness than careful planning. A single window, perpetually clouded with wood shavings and the faint scent of linseed oil, offered a meager view of the towering pines. Inside, the air hummed with the constant drone of Jasper's tools - his grandfather's hand-plane, a well-loved drawknife, and a collection of chisels, each whispering a silent history of wood shaped and dreams realized. Shelves overflowed with odd bits of lumber, salvaged treasures, and half-finished projects that spoke of a man wrestling with both the beauty and the challenge of his craft. The floor was a chaotic mosaic of wood chips, sawdust, and forgotten nails, a testament to the countless hours Jasper spent hunched over his workbench, coaxing life from inanimate wood.
