The high desert air crackled with heat, a dry, relentless heat that promised to leach every last drop of moisture from your skin. Dust devils danced across the parched earth, ephemeral ghosts kicking up grit that scratched at your eyes and stung your nostrils. Amelia Rose Thorne, her face already stained with grime and sunblock, spat a mouthful of the fine, red dust and wiped her forehead with a forearm that was permanently tanned.

This was Red Rock Ridge, Nevada, a place where the sky was vast and unforgiving and the landscape stretched out in shades of ochre and rust until it met the hazy blue horizon. The only sign of civilization for miles was the sprawling complex of the Silver Buckle Mining Company – a jumble of corrugated iron buildings, mountains of tailings, and the ever-present hum of machinery that vibrated through the ground.

Amelia wasn't bothered by the isolation. She thrived on it. Give her a machine, a challenging task, and the wide-open space of the Nevada desert, and she was content. Especially when that machine was her baby: a Caterpillar 992K Wheel Loader, painted a bright, almost defiant, yellow against the muted landscape. She called her "Buttercup," a ridiculous name for such a powerful beast, but the name felt right. Buttercup responded to Amelia’s touch, obeying her commands with a rumbling groan and a satisfying crunch as she scooped up mountains of overburden, clearing the way for the dynamiters to get to the silver ore below. Today, though, Buttercup was idling, her powerful engine purring quietly, as Amelia waited for the foreman’s signal. Something felt off. The air was heavy, the silence between the dust devils unusually still. She had a bad feeling blooming in her gut, a feeling that told her this day wasn't going to be just another day on Red Rock Ridge.
