Okay, here's a story opening, setting, and main character introduction:

**Story Opening:**

The turbulence hit without warning, a violent jolt that ripped through the cabin like a disgruntled giant shaking a dollhouse. Bags tumbled from overhead compartments, a child screamed, and Beatrice Eleanor Cavendish, with ten years of flying under her belt, braced herself against a galley counter, her practiced smile plastered on her face despite the surge of adrenaline. "Ladies and gentlemen," her voice, honed to a soothing calm, cut through the chaos, "please return to your seats and fasten your seatbelts. We're experiencing some light turbulence." Light, Beatrice thought grimly, felt more like being strapped to a paint shaker. She glanced at her colleague, young Mark, whose face was the color of the complimentary blueberry muffins, and offered him a reassuring wink. This wasn't her first rodeo. But something about the suddenness, the raw power of the buffetting wind, sent a shiver down her spine that had nothing to do with cabin air conditioning. This felt different.

**Setting:**

The story begins aboard a Boeing 777, registration number N782XX, flying under the banner of TransGlobal Airlines. The flight is TG456, a red-eye service from London Heathrow (LHR) to Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). It's approximately six hours into the eleven-hour flight, placing them somewhere over the vast, inky expanse of the North Atlantic, far from any landmass. The interior of the plane is typical TransGlobal: deep blue upholstery, faux wood trim, and the pervasive smell of recycled air and lukewarm coffee. Most of the passengers are asleep, or trying to be, under thin blankets provided by the airline. The mood before the turbulence had been the usual subdued quiet of a long-haul overnight flight, punctuated by the hum of the engines and the occasional snore.

**Main Character:**

**Full Name:** Beatrice Eleanor Cavendish

**Brief Introduction (embedded in the opening):** Beatrice is a seasoned flight attendant with ten years of experience. She possesses a calm and reassuring demeanor, honed from years of dealing with everything from airsick passengers to lost passports. While outwardly composed, she's observant and possesses a keen intuition, which tells her that this particular bout of turbulence is more than just a routine air pocket. She's in her early thirties, carries herself with a quiet confidence, and has a subtle, almost imperceptible air of world-weariness about her.
