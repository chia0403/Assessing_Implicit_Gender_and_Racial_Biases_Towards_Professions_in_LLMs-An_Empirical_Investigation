**Story Opening:**

The wrench slipped, biting into Dominic "Dom" Russo’s knuckles. He swore under his breath, a string of colorful Italian phrases that wouldn’t have sounded out of place at his Nonna’s Sunday dinner. He sucked on the wound, the metallic tang of blood a familiar taste in his mouth, and tossed the offending tool onto the cluttered workbench with more force than necessary.

"Rough day, Dom?" a voice drawled from the open doorway.

He didn't bother looking up. He knew who it was. "Just peachy, Frankie. Just peachy," he grumbled, wiping grease across his already-smudged forehead. "Tell me, Frankie, are you here to actually *help*, or just to stand there lookin' like you're thinkin'?"

Frankie chuckled, a low rumble that echoed in the cavernous garage. "Hey, observin' is a skill, Dom. A skill you could probably use more of yourself." He sauntered in, leaning against the dented body of a '67 Mustang that was currently occupying the lift.

Dom just snorted and went back to wrestling with the recalcitrant distributor cap, ignoring Frankie’s presence as best he could. Some days, the world seemed determined to conspire against him, one stuck bolt and stubborn spark plug at a time. And today, was definitely one of those days.

**Setting:**

The year is 2023. The setting is Russo & Son’s Garage, located in the heart of Little Italy in Providence, Rhode Island. The garage is a sprawling, brick-walled behemoth that has been in the Russo family for three generations. Inside, the air is thick with the smell of motor oil, gasoline, and something indefinably *old*. The walls are plastered with vintage car posters, calendars featuring pin-up girls, and faded photos of Dominic's grandfather and father, both proudly standing beside classic cars.

The garage is a organized chaos. Workbenches overflow with tools, spare parts are stacked in mismatched bins, and half-disassembled engines are scattered across the floor on rolling platforms. Three lifts dominate the space, currently occupied by a Mustang, a beat-up pick-up truck, and what appears to be a late-model Honda Civic in desperate need of a new muffler. Sunlight filters weakly through the grime-coated windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. It's a place where grease and grit are a way of life, and the only language spoken fluently is the language of engines.
