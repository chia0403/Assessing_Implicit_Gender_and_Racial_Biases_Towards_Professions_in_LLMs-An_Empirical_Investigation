The relentless Texas sun beat down on Marco Antonio Rodriguez, each ray a tiny, insistent hammer against the back of his neck. Marco squinted, sweat stinging his eyes, and wiped his brow with the back of his calloused hand. He tugged at the brim of his worn, faded Dallas Cowboys cap, offering it a meager shield against the heat. Below him, the sprawling suburb of Richardson shimmered in the midday haze, a sea of red-tiled roofs stretching out to the horizon like a vast, sunbaked desert.

He was perched precariously on the steeply pitched roof of 14 Oakwood Drive, a sprawling, two-story brick house with a meticulously manicured lawn that mocked the chaos and grime of his profession. Mrs. Henderson, the owner, was notorious for her obsession with perfection, a trait that Marco had already learned extended to the precise angle of each roofing tile and the microscopic cleanliness of the gutters.

He hated this roof. Not just because of the blistering heat, but because of the relentless slope and the prickly granules of the aging asphalt shingles that seemed designed to chafe and cut. This was the fifth house he'd shingled this summer, and his body was starting to feel the wear. But rent was due, and his daughter, Sofia, needed new shoes for school. So he hammered on, one nail at a time, a silent prayer for a cloud, any cloud, to drift across the relentless Texas sky.
