## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The wind clawed at the basalt walls of Grimspire Keep, a fortress carved into the jagged spine of the Dragon's Tooth Mountains. Built centuries ago to hold back the gnoll hordes from the verdant lowlands, Grimspire was now a forgotten outpost, its purpose blurred by years of peace bought with the blood of forgotten heroes. The air, even in the heart of summer, was perpetually chilled and thick with the scent of pine and damp stone. Inside the keep, torches sputtered and hissed, casting flickering shadows that danced with the whispers of the wind, exaggerating the cracks and wear in the ancient stonework. The common room, a drafty chamber with a perpetually cold hearth, was sparsely furnished with rough-hewn tables and benches, each bearing the scars of countless bored soldiers.

**Story Opening:**

The taste of weak ale clung to Corporal Alaric Blackwood's tongue, a bitter reminder of the dreariness that had become his life. He shifted his weight, the worn leather of his cuirass groaning in protest, and rubbed a hand over the stubble that perpetually shadowed his jaw. Another night. Another watch. Another endless vista of jagged peaks and empty promises. Alaric sighed, the sound swallowed by the mournful howl of the wind whistling through the crenellations. He glanced towards the doorway, the flickering torchlight painting long, distorted shadows on the stone floor. Nothing. Just the eternal silence of Grimspire Keep, a silence so profound it felt like it was listening back. He took another swig of his ale, the lukewarm liquid doing little to dispel the gnawing emptiness within him. A rat scurried across the floor, its beady eyes glinting in the dim light. Alaric watched it with a morbid fascination. At least *something* moved in this godforsaken place. Then, a different sound cut through the silence â€“ a metallic scrape, followed by a muffled thud from the direction of the East Gate. Alaric's hand instinctively went to the hilt of his sword. This was it. This was *something*.
