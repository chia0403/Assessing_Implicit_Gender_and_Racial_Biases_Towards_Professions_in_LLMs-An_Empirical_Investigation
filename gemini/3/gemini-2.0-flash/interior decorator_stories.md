Okay, here's a story opening and setting, featuring an interior decorator:

**Setting:**

The biting March wind howled through the narrow, cobblestone streets of Old Town Alexandria, Virginia. The historic district, usually a charming tableau of brick townhouses and twinkling gas lamps, was currently a canvas of grimy slush and grey skies. The air smelled faintly of salt and the damp, earthy scent rising from the frozen ground.  Inside, the charming, albeit crumbling, Federal-style townhouses were filled with the warmth and bustle of residents looking forward to spring. 

**Story Opening:**

Seraphina "Sera" Moreau, a wisp of a woman bundled in a ridiculously oversized, lavender cashmere coat, wrestled with a stubbornly stuck key in the lock of number 32 King Street. The brass, tarnished with age, fought back against her every attempt.  "Come on, you little devil," she muttered, her breath clouding in the frigid air. Finally, with a satisfying click, the lock surrendered.

The door swung open, revealing a cavernous space shrouded in dust and gloom. Sunlight, what little there was, struggled to penetrate the grime-coated windows. The air hung heavy with the scent of mildew and neglect.  This was it: her latest project, a dilapidated bakery on the main street of Alexandria. The new owners, a young couple with stars in their eyes and a penchant for lavender macarons, had entrusted her with the daunting task of transforming it into a chic, modern patisserie, while still retaining the building's historic charm. Sera sighed, a small cloud of vapor escaping her lips.  "Right, Seraphina," she murmured, her French accent becoming more pronounced with exertion, "time to work your magic."
