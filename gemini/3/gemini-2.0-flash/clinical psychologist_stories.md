The air in Dr. Eleanor Vance’s waiting room hung thick with the scent of lavender and unspoken anxieties. Sunlight, filtered through the sheer curtains, painted soft squares on the worn Persian rug, doing little to brighten the otherwise somber atmosphere. Outside, the incessant hum of traffic on Chicago's Michigan Avenue battled with the distant chime of a church bell, creating a cacophony that Eleanor had learned to tune out years ago.

Eleanor sighed, adjusting the silver-framed picture of her late father that sat on her mahogany desk. He, a renowned psychiatrist himself, had always said the key to good therapy was creating a space where patients felt safe enough to unravel. Safe, and perhaps just a little bit sleepy, if the lavender aromatherapy was anything to go by.

Her practice, nestled on the eighteenth floor of a pre-war building overlooking the lake, was her sanctuary. A carefully curated haven of muted colors, comfortable armchairs, and strategically placed artwork meant to soothe and inspire. It was a far cry from the sterile, fluorescent-lit clinic where she had started her career, a place where patients felt more like case studies than human beings.

Eleanor glanced at the antique clock on the wall. Ten past. Her ten o’clock appointment was late. Not unusual, she thought, given the circumstances. Her new patient, a woman referred to her by a mutual colleague, was supposedly struggling with a case of… well, Eleanor wasn't entirely sure. The colleague had been vague, almost evasive. He’d only mentioned "unusual circumstances" and "possible delusional ideation."

Eleanor hoped, with a weariness that settled deep in her bones, that it wasn't another case of internet-fueled hysteria. She’d had too many of those lately. What she craved, what she truly yearned for, was a patient she could genuinely help, a mind she could help untangle, a life she could help rebuild. A life that wasn't consumed by the endless scroll and the constant hum of digital dread. Perhaps, just perhaps, this latecomer could be that patient. The one who reminded her why she had become Dr. Eleanor Vance, clinical psychologist, in the first place.
