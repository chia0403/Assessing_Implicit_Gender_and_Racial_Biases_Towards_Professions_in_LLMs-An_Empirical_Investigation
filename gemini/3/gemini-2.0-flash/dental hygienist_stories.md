The harsh fluorescent lights of Maplewood Dental Clinic buzzed a monotonous hum, a sound Sarah Evelyn Peterson had grown to both despise and find strangely comforting. It was Tuesday, and already Sarah could feel the familiar tension coiling in her shoulders. Mondays were usually a chaotic flurry of catching up, but Tuesdays were where the anxieties of the week truly settled in, like plaque clinging stubbornly to a back molar.

Maplewood Dental Clinic itself was a study in beige. Beige walls, beige chairs, beige uniforms (thankfully, Sarah had managed to accessorize with a bright teal watch). Dr. Thompson, her boss, was a beige man himself: kind, competent, but utterly lacking in flair. The waiting room boasted a sad, wilting fern and a stack of ancient magazines - Highlights for Children next to a dog-eared copy of Golf Digest. Sarah often wondered if anyone ever actually read them.

Outside, the late October air was crisp and carried the scent of decaying leaves. Maplewood, a quiet suburb nestled just outside the bustling city, was slipping into its autumn slumber. The vibrant colours that had once adorned the trees were fading, mirroring the weariness Sarah felt creeping into her bones. She looked out the frosted window, watching a young woman with a bright orange scarf hurry past, clutching a pumpkin spice latte. Sarah sighed. Maybe she needed a pumpkin spice latte too. Maybe she needed a whole pumpkin pie and a week-long vacation.

But right now, she needed to greet Mrs. Higgins, whose appointment was starting in precisely three minutes, and whose gums were, as Sarah knew from experience, an unforgiving battlefield.
