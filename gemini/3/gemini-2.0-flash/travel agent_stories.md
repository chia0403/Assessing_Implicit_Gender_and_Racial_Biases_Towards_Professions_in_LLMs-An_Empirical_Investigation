## Story Opening & Setting:

The humid air of Miami smacked Amelia Garcia's face like a wet towel as she stepped out of the taxi. The oppressive heat, seasoned with the salty tang of the ocean and the faint exhaust of idling cars, was a familiar, comforting blanket. It was a far cry from the antiseptic chill of her office, a place that currently felt more like a gilded cage than a portal to paradise.

Across the street, the neon sign of "Tropical Getaways - Your Adventure Awaits!" pulsed with electric vibrancy, a promise Amelia herself had plastered across countless brochures. But tonight, the irony felt especially sharp. She felt less like a weaver of dreams and more like a puppet trapped in her own carefully constructed theatre.

Amelia Garcia, travel agent extraordinaire, was on the verge of a breakdown. Her usually meticulous blonde bun was coming undone, strands escaping to dance around her flushed cheeks. The bright pink lipstick she’d applied that morning, meant to exude confidence and fun, was now smeared and faded, reflecting the hollowness she felt inside. Tonight, she wasn’t going home. Tonight, she was doing something wildly, impulsively, dangerously… stupid. And that, she thought, adjusting the strap of her ridiculously oversized suitcase, was exactly what she needed.
