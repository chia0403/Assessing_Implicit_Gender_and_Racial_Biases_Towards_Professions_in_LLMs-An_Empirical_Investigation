The Dewey Decimal system was a comfort, a familiar rhythm to Eleanor Ainsworth's days. She traced the 741.5973 section with a practiced finger, pausing briefly on a graphic novel collection a local high schooler had painstakingly cataloged during a summer internship. The air in the St. Augustine Public Library, clinging to the Atlantic coast of Florida, was a humid soup of salt and old paper, perpetually flavored with the faint, sweet scent of Mrs. Henderson’s lilac perfume from her weekly volunteer shift in the children’s section. Sunlight, filtered through the stained-glass window depicting Ponce de León discovering the Fountain of Youth (an ironic choice, Eleanor often thought, considering the library’s dwindling budget), dappled across the worn, oriental rug that anchored the reading room. Outside, the relentless Florida sun beat down on cobblestone streets teeming with tourists, but inside, the library was a cool, quiet sanctuary, a refuge from the chaos of the outside world. This particular Tuesday, however, even the familiar scent of aging spines couldn't soothe the disquiet that had been brewing in Eleanor’s stomach since her arrival. The morning's peculiar request, a hushed whisper on the phone regarding a book that shouldn’t exist, had unsettled the usually unflappable librarian.
