## Story Opening & Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The dust danced around Elias Thorne's worn leather boots, each tiny particle catching the weak morning light filtering through the mouth of the quarry. He spat, a thick glob of moisture swallowed by the ever-present grit, and stretched his aching back. Another day, another mountain of stone. He ran a calloused hand over the rough surface of the limestone block before him, tracing the faint, natural fissures that snaked across its face like ancient rivers etched in time. Today, this stone would become a keystone for the new bridge, a symbol of connection, a testament to the enduring strength of the people of Aelwyne. A strength Elias often felt was slowly eroding away, one swing of his hammer at a time.

**Setting:**

The story is set in **Aelwyne**, a small, hardy village nestled at the foot of the towering Grey Fang mountains. Life in Aelwyne revolved around the Grey Fang's rich veins of limestone, the lifeblood of the village's economy. The village itself is a cluster of squat, stone buildings huddled together for warmth and protection against the harsh mountain winds. The air is perpetually thick with the scent of damp earth and the fine dust kicked up by the constant quarrying. The landscape is dominated by the looming presence of the Grey Fang, their peaks perpetually capped with snow, casting long, dramatic shadows across the valley. The **Limestone Quarry of Aelwyne**, located just outside the village, is a sprawling, dusty pit, a scarred testament to the generations who have toiled there, their lives inextricably linked to the stone within.
