The late afternoon sun, a molten orange smear against the bruised-purple clouds gathering over the Rockies, glinted off the sweat beading on Elias “Eli” Theodore Johnson’s forehead. He wiped it away with the back of his dusty, orange-vested hand, leaving a streak of grime that resembled a small, geographical fault line. He leaned heavily on his shovel, the metal warm against his calloused palms.

The setting was a particularly desolate stretch of Highway 50, nicknamed "The Loneliest Road in America" for good reason. Fifty miles in either direction offered nothing but scrub brush, wind-battered junipers clinging to the rocky slopes, and the occasional bleached-white skeleton of some unfortunate animal that had dared to cross its path. Eli and his two-man crew, comprised of the perpetually-grumbling Dale and the surprisingly optimistic Maria, were currently patching a pothole the size of a small bathtub near mile marker 237. The rhythmic thump-thump-thump of passing eighteen-wheelers was the only soundtrack to their day, a constant reminder of the relentless traffic that punished this lonely ribbon of asphalt. Above, the hawks circled, silent sentinels against the vast, indifferent sky, waiting for anything that might not make it.
