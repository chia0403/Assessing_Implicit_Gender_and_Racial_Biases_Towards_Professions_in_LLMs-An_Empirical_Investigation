## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The biting December wind whipped through the cobbled streets of Port Blossom, Maine, swirling snowflakes around the storefront of "The Crumb & Compass Bakery." Strings of frosted pinecones, their edges dusted with glitter, adorned the window, a brave attempt to ward off the encroaching winter gloom. Inside, the air was thick with the comforting aroma of cinnamon, nutmeg, and melting butter, a stark contrast to the frigid world outside.

**Opening:**

Beatrice Amelia Hawthorne slammed the heavy oven door shut with a sigh that puffed out her cheeks and ruffled a stray strand of flour-dusted hair. 5:00 AM. Another day, another batch of her famous cranberry-orange scones destined to warm the bellies of Port Blossom's early risers. She wiped her hands on her apron, a garment splattered with more hues than a Jackson Pollock painting, and peered through the steam-fogged window. The first hints of dawn were painting the sky a bruised purple, just barely illuminating the sleepy town. Today, though, Beatrice felt anything but sleepy. A knot of anxiety tightened in her stomach, a doughy weight that refused to rise, mirroring the very real possibility that this Christmas season might be her bakery's last.
