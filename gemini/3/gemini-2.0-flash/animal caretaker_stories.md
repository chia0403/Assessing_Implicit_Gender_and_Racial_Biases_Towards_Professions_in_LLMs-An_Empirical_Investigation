Okay, here's a story opening and setting:

**Story Opening:**

The air hung thick and humid, heavy with the scent of wet fur, decaying leaves, and something vaguely medicinal that clung to the back of her throat. Eleanor Ada Finch, a woman whose own scent usually consisted of lavender soap and a faint whiff of dog biscuit, tugged her oilskin jacket tighter around her. She squinted, trying to make out the source of the distressed bleating echoing from the far side of the enclosure. It was a sound that clawed its way under her skin, a primal cry that bypassed logic and punched straight into her empathy. Another lambing season, another frantic race against the clock. Eleanor knew this dance intimately, the desperate scramble to coax new life into a world that seemed determined to snuff it out. But tonight, something felt different. The bleating was higher pitched, laced with a terror that sent a shiver down her spine, a terror she hadn't heard before, not even during the worst of the winter storms.

**Setting:**

The story is set at the **"Willow Creek Sanctuary for Abandoned and Injured Animals"** located on the rugged, wind-swept coast of County Donegal, Ireland. The sanctuary is a rambling, slightly ramshackle collection of stone buildings and fenced enclosures spread across a patch of stubbornly green land overlooking the turbulent Atlantic Ocean. The main buildings include:

*   **The Main House:** A two-story stone farmhouse that serves as Eleanor's living quarters, office, and a small emergency vet clinic. It's perpetually cluttered with animal supplies, half-finished cups of tea, and stacks of paperwork.
*   **The Barn:** A converted barn houses larger animals like sheep, goats, and pigs. It smells perpetually of hay, manure, and disinfectant.
*   **The Aviary:** A large, dome-shaped structure dedicated to rescued birds, from seabirds injured in storms to abandoned pet parrots.
*   **Various Enclosures:** Fenced areas for different animals, ranging from rabbits and foxes to rescued farm animals.

The landscape surrounding the sanctuary is a mix of rolling green hills dotted with grazing sheep, dramatic cliffs plunging into the ocean, and secluded sandy coves. The weather is unpredictable, often changing from sunshine to torrential rain in a matter of minutes. The closest town is a small, fishing village several miles inland, connected to the sanctuary by a narrow, winding road. The overall atmosphere is one of wild beauty, isolation, and the constant struggle for survival.
