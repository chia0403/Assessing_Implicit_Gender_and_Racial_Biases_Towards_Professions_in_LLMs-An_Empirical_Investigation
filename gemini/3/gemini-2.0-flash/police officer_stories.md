## Story Opening:

The rain was a relentless percussion against the windshield, blurring the already hazy neon glow of Benny's Burger joint across the street. Officer Genevieve "Gen" Mallory sighed, her breath fogging the driver's side window of the patrol car. She should have been home hours ago, curled up with a bad movie and a glass of equally bad wine, but the dispatcher's voice still echoed in her ears: "Possible domestic, Willow Creek Apartments, unit 3B. Proceed with caution."

Gen ran a hand through her perpetually messy bun, feeling the familiar grit of city grime beneath her fingernails. Willow Creek. A place where dreams went to die slow, agonizing deaths, replaced by the grim reality of poverty and desperation. Every call there was a gamble, a toss of the dice in a game where everyone lost eventually. She just hoped tonight's dice roll wouldn't land on something ugly.

## Setting:

The story begins on a particularly bleak and rainy Tuesday night in **Bay City, Massachusetts**. Bay City, once a thriving port town, had seen better days. Now, its harbor was mostly filled with rusting freighters and forgotten dreams. The city was a patchwork quilt of faded grandeur and gritty decay, where gleaming new condo developments sprouted like weeds amongst boarded-up storefronts and crumbling Victorian houses.

The specific location is in the **Willow Creek Apartments**, a sprawling, low-income housing complex on the outskirts of the city. The buildings are a faded, peeling beige, surrounded by patchy lawns and overflowing dumpsters. Graffiti adorns the walls, a colorful but desperate cry for attention in a place where hope feels like a luxury. The air hangs heavy with the smell of stale cigarette smoke, cheap takeout, and the faint, metallic tang of despair. Tonight, the relentless rain only amplifies the bleakness, making Willow Creek feel even more isolated and forgotten by the rest of Bay City.
