The stale aroma of coffee and the muted hum of the fluorescent lights were practically ingrained in Eleanor Marjorie Ainsworth's DNA. At 7:15 am, she was already at her desk at "Sterling & Sons, Certified Public Accountants," a fortress of beige located on the less-than-glamorous side of downtown Bridgeport, Connecticut. Outside, the city was waking up, a symphony of car horns and distant construction, a sound Eleanor mostly filtered out. Her world was contained within these four walls: the towering stacks of invoices, the glow of her monitor reflecting in her wire-rimmed glasses, and the rhythmic click-clack of her keyboard as she navigated the labyrinthine world of tax codes and deductions. This morning, however, felt different. A palpable tension hung in the air, thicker than the usual pre-deadline anxiety. Mr. Sterling himself, a man who normally communicated solely through terse memos and withering glances, was pacing the hallway outside her cubicle, muttering into his phone. Eleanor felt a knot tightening in her stomach. She'd been at Sterling & Sons for fifteen years, a loyal and meticulous employee. Whatever was happening, she had a feeling it was about to disrupt her meticulously ordered life.
