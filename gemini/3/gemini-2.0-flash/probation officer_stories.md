Okay, here's a story opening and setting:

**Setting:** The perpetually overcast skies of Tacoma, Washington, seemed to mirror the mood inside the sterile, fluorescent-lit offices of the Pierce County Probation Department. Rain streaked down the grimy windowpanes, blurring the already-uninspiring view of the industrial port. Inside, a low hum permeated the air – the combined drone of computer fans, overworked air conditioning, and the quiet anxieties of both staff and probationers alike.

**Opening:**

The insistent ring of the telephone cut through the dull office hum like a rusty knife. Eleanor Mae Harding sighed, rubbing the bridge of her nose. She knew better than to hope for good news. Good news rarely came in a probation officer's world. It was almost always a violation, a relapse, or worse. "Harding," she answered, her voice a practiced blend of professional detachment and weary compassion. The voice on the other end was high-pitched and laced with panic. “Ms. Harding, it’s…it’s Dwayne. He’s gone. He left a note, and…and it doesn’t sound good.” Eleanor’s stomach twisted. Dwayne. Just when he seemed to be turning a corner. She grabbed a pen, the plastic digging into her skin. This was going to be a long day.
