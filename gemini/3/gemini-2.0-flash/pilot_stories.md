## Story Opening:

The harsh clang of metal on metal ripped Captain Amelia “Echo” Earhart from a fitful sleep. Her heart hammered against her ribs, a frantic drumbeat mirroring the persistent wind howling outside. She fumbled for the small lamp on her bedside table, its dim, flickering light casting long, distorted shadows across the cramped cabin. Another clang, this time followed by a muffled curse in Icelandic.

Amelia sat up, her spine protesting the stiff cot. She ran a hand through her already dishevelled dark hair, pulling it back from her tired face. The storm that had been threatening for days had finally arrived, and it was making short work of the old corrugated iron that served as the hangar roof. A grim smile touched her lips. Just another Monday in the North Atlantic.

## Setting:

The story opens in the small, isolated Icelandic fishing village of Vik i Myrdal, in the year 1938. The village, clinging precariously to the black sand beaches beneath the shadow of the Katla volcano, is a collection of brightly painted, wind-battered buildings huddled together for protection against the relentless elements.

Amelia’s cabin, a former fisherman’s shack hastily converted into living quarters, is located on the outskirts of the village, next to a ramshackle hangar that houses her pride and joy: a heavily modified Lockheed Electra 10E. The air hangs thick with the salty tang of the ocean, mingled with the faint, ever-present scent of volcanic ash. In the distance, the dark, jagged cliffs of the Reynisdrangar sea stacks stand like ancient sentinels, constantly battered by the unforgiving waves. The overall atmosphere is one of rugged beauty and stark isolation, a place where survival is a daily challenge and the line between land and sea is constantly blurred.
