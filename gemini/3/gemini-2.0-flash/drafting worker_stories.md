## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights of the CAD room hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Eleanor Beatrice Finch's life. Each buzz and flicker seemed to amplify the ache blooming in her shoulders. Another hour, she estimated, before she could escape the pale glow and the relentless digital lines forming on her monitor. She adjusted her glasses, pushing them further up her nose, and leaned closer to the screen. The intricate blueprint for the new wing of the St. Jude's Hospital swam before her eyes, a chaotic ballet of vents, electrical conduits, and structural supports. One wrong placement, one miscalculated angle, and the whole thing could come crashing down, both literally and figuratively. The weight of that potential failure settled heavily on her chest, a familiar companion.

## Setting:

The setting is the small, windowless CAD (Computer-Aided Design) room of "Miller & Sons, Architectural Design," a family-owned firm nestled on the second floor of a brick building in the quiet, almost forgotten, industrial district of Willow Creek, Ohio. The room itself is Spartan: four desks crammed together, each occupied by a drafting worker hunched over a computer. Old coffee stains adorn the particleboard surfaces, and the air is thick with the faint smell of stale coffee and the silent frustration of deadlines looming. A faded poster of Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater hangs crookedly on the wall, a silent reminder of the lofty aspirations that often feel distant in the day-to-day grind of designing HVAC systems and calculating square footage. Outside, the world bustles with the sounds of delivery trucks and the distant whistle of a train, sounds that rarely penetrate the hermetically sealed world of Eleanor's work.
