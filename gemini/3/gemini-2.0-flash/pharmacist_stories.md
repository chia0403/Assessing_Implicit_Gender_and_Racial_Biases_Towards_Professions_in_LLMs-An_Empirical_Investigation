Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a pharmacist named Eleanor Rose Hawthorne:

**Opening:**

The flickering fluorescent lights of Hawthorne Pharmacy cast a jaundiced glow on the overflowing stacks of prescription requests. Eleanor Rose Hawthorne, owner and sole pharmacist, massaged the bridge of her nose, the scent of alcohol disinfectant and synthetic vanilla from the over-the-counter cough syrup clinging to her like a persistent memory. It was nearing 7 pm, and the last of the after-school rush had finally trickled out, leaving behind a hushed quiet punctuated only by the rhythmic hum of the refrigerated vaccine case in the back.  She should be locking up, driving the twenty minutes home to a microwave dinner and the comforting drone of true crime podcasts. But a nagging feeling, a prickle on the back of her neck that often preceded trouble in the quiet town of Havenwood, kept her rooted to the spot.  A name, unfamiliar yet somehow unsettling, echoed in her mind as she meticulously straightened the rows of antacids: Silas Blackwood.

**Setting:**

Havenwood, Pennsylvania, nestled deep in the Appalachian foothills, was the kind of town where everyone knew your grandmother's maiden name and the specific dosage of her blood pressure medication. It was a place where the biggest excitement was the annual Apple Festival, and the most scandalous news revolved around Mrs. Henderson's prize-winning pumpkin being suspiciously lighter this year. Hawthorne Pharmacy, located on Main Street between the Havenwood Diner and the dusty antique store, had been a fixture in the community for over fifty years, started by Eleanor's grandfather. The pharmacy itself was a time capsule, from the original oak shelving that held rows of amber-colored medicine bottles to the antique cash register that still worked surprisingly well. Despite the charm, the pharmacy was starting to show its age. The linoleum floor was scuffed, the paint was peeling, and the smell of old remedies hung in the air like a lingering ghost. Eleanor had inherited it five years ago, after her grandfather's passing, and was determined to keep it going, even as corporate chains encroached, promising cheaper prices and convenience. She saw it as more than just a business; it was a legacy, a responsibility, and the very heart of Havenwood's well-being.
