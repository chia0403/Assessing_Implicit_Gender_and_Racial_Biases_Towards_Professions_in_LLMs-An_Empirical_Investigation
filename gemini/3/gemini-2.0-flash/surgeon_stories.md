## Story Opening:

The humid New Orleans air, thick with the scent of jasmine and decay, clung to Dr. Anya Petrova like a second skin as she stepped out of the cab.  She hadn't been back to the city in twelve years, not since... well, not since she'd promised herself she'd never look back.  But a promise, she was learning, could be a flimsy thing when faced with a summons like this.

The iron gate creaked open with a mournful groan, revealing a courtyard overgrown with weeds and a looming Victorian mansion shrouded in shadows.  The peeling paint, the boarded-up windows, the palpable sense of abandonment - it was all exactly as she remembered it.  Even the gargoyle perched precariously on the roof seemed to glare down at her with knowing disapproval.

Anya adjusted the strap of her worn leather satchel, the soft weight of her tools a familiar comfort against her hip.  She took a deep breath, the air heavy with the ghosts of her past.  This wasn't just about a patient. This was about facing the house that held her secrets captive, the house sheâ€™d sworn to forget.  This was about confronting the reason she became a surgeon in the first place.
