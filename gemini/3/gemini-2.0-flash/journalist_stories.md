## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The dim, cluttered office of the "Granite City Gazette" newspaper, located in Aberdeen, Scotland. It's late October, and the wind howls outside, rattling the ancient single-paned windows. The air is thick with the smell of stale coffee, cheap printer ink, and the faint, persistent odor of damp wool. Stacks of old newspapers threaten to topple from overflowing shelves, casting long, distorted shadows in the flickering fluorescent light. Empty takeaway containers litter desks, a testament to countless rushed deadlines.

**Opening:**

Eleanor Margaret Campbell, a journalist for the "Granite City Gazette," rubbed the sleep from her eyes, the gritty feeling mirroring the texture of the city outside her window. It was 2:17 am, according to the ancient clock on the wall, its ticking a metronomic counterpoint to the rhythmic hum of the office's lone desktop computer. Her fingers, stained with ink from yesterday’s print run, tapped a restless rhythm on the chipped Formica surface of her desk. She’d been staring at the same half-written sentence for the past hour: "The discovery, initially dismissed as a mere geological anomaly..." A geological anomaly? More like a giant middle finger from the Earth, delivered straight to the doorstep of a quaint Aberdeenshire village. The phone call she'd received earlier, a frantic whisper laced with fear and punctuated by what sounded suspiciously like *growling*, replayed in her mind. She needed another coffee. And maybe, just maybe, she needed to stop convincing herself she was going crazy. Because if what that voice had claimed was true, then "geological anomaly" wouldn’t even begin to cover it.
