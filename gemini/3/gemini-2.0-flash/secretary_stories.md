The chipped ceramic mug, warmed by the barely-there-strength Earl Grey tea, did little to combat the bone-chilling draft that perpetually snaked through the halls of Harrington, Harrington & Hayes. Penelope Primrose Plimpton, a secretary with the patience of a saint and the typing speed of a hummingbird, shivered deeper into her threadbare cardigan.

Her workspace, a cramped cubicle wedged between the perpetually-buzzing photocopier and the breakroom, was a monument to beige. Beige walls, beige carpet, beige everything. The only splash of colour came from the wilting peace lily on her desk, a gift from her Aunt Mildred which, despite Penelope's best efforts, seemed determined to join the corporate aesthetic in its own, dying way.

It was 7:58 AM on a Tuesday, and Penelope already felt like she'd aged a decade. The clatter of the ancient, manual typewriter down the hall, belonging to Mr. Abernathy, the firm's most senior (and least technologically-inclined) partner, echoed like a death knell. He was always the first in, a relic of a bygone era clinging fiercely to his antiquated methods. Penelope braced herself. She knew exactly what was coming: a summons for her to decipher Mr. Abernathy's barely legible chicken scratch and transform it into proper, presentable legal documents. It was a daily ritual, a trial by ink, and Penelope Plimpton, despite her best efforts to blend into the beige background, was about to face it head-on.
