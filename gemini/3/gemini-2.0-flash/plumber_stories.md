The rusty wrench slipped in damp, gloved hands, sending a sharp clang echoing through the cavernous, dimly lit basement. Rain lashed against the grimy, arched windows high above, mimicking the frantic hammering of Arthur Reginald Finch's heart. He’d been called to Oakhaven Manor on the outskirts of Blackwood two hours ago, and the dripping pipe under the main staircase was proving to be less a plumbing problem and more an existential crisis.

Oakhaven Manor was the kind of place you saw on postcards - Gothic architecture, sprawling grounds shrouded in mist, and a palpable sense of history clinging to every ivy-covered brick. It belonged, according to Mrs. Abernathy, the sharp-tongued housekeeper, to the estate of the late Baron Von Hess, a reclusive eccentric rumored to have collected artifacts from all corners of the world.

Arthur, a man who considered a successful drain unclogging to be a peak achievement, felt thoroughly out of place in this mausoleum of a building. The air hung thick with the scent of dust, mothballs, and something indefinably…old. The basement itself was a labyrinth of stone corridors, each turning opening onto dusty rooms filled with cobweb-draped furniture and forgotten treasures. A stuffed bear with a single, vacant eye stared down at him from a rickety platform in the corner, and every shadow seemed to writhe with secrets. He just wanted to fix the leak and get back to his warm, brightly lit flat above the hardware store, but the damn pipe refused to cooperate, and the silence of the manor felt like it was pressing down on him, suffocating him with its weight.
