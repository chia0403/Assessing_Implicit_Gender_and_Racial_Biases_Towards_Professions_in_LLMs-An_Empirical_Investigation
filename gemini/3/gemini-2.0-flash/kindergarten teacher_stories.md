Penelope, with flour dusting the perpetually kind lines around her eyes, sighed contentedly. Even amidst the controlled pandemonium, there was a magic in these first days of the school year. A magic that made sticky fingers and spilled juice feel less like a chore and more like a tiny, bright adventure.
