## Story Opening:

The squeak of rubber soles against linoleum was the soundtrack to Amelia Beatrice Bellweather's life. It was the sound of progress, of recovery, of the slow, arduous climb back to function. Today, however, it was just irritating. Amelia glared at the stubborn water stain blooming on the ceiling tile above Mrs. Henderson's prone form, willing it to disappear. Rain had been relentless for a week straight, and the leak in the roof of the Meadowbrook Assisted Living Facility was a particularly unwelcome visitor.

Mrs. Henderson, a woman who remembered seeing Amelia Earhart take flight, was attempting, with a groan that rattled Amelia's fillings, to lift her leg a single inch off the treatment table. Amelia counted silently: "One...two...three..." before instructing her to relax.

"Good, Mrs. Henderson," Amelia said, forcing a cheerfulness she didn't quite feel. "Just like that. We'll build up to more. Rome wasn't built in a day, you know."

Mrs. Henderson huffed, a sound like air escaping a leaky balloon. "Rome had younger knees, dear. And no leaky roof."

Amelia sighed internally. She loved her work, genuinely. But sometimes, the sheer weight of her patients' aches, pains, and the crumbling infrastructure around her felt overwhelming. She needed a vacation. Desperately.

## Setting:

**Meadowbrook Assisted Living Facility, Meadowbrook, Pennsylvania. Late October.**

Meadowbrook was a sprawling, single-story building, the color of faded beige that screamed "budget-friendly." It sat on a large plot of land, mostly paved over for parking, with a small, fenced-in garden at the back, now dormant for the winter. Inside, the air was a cocktail of disinfectant, stale coffee, and the faint, lingering aroma of institutional meals. The physical therapy room, where Amelia spent most of her days, was a cramped space crammed with treatment tables, resistance bands, weights, and a small rowing machine that perpetually needed oiling. The walls were adorned with motivational posters featuring smiling seniors doing yoga and platitudes like "Movement is Medicine" in bold, optimistic lettering. Despite Amelia's best efforts to personalize it with a few potted plants and a string of fairy lights, the room always felt sterile and a little sad. Outside the room, the halls were a bustling microcosm of aging, filled with residents shuffling along with walkers, nurses rushing between rooms, and the constant, low hum of televisions broadcasting daytime talk shows.
