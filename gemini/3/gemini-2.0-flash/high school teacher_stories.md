The chipped, ceramic mug warmed Mr. Arthur Pemberton's hands, offering a meager defense against the pre-dawn chill that permeated his small kitchen. He stared out the grimy window, watching the sickly yellow glow of the streetlights struggle against the encroaching darkness. Heâ€™d been awake since 4:00 AM, a familiar torment fuelled by the endless cycle of grading papers and dreading another day at Northwood High.

Arthur wasn't one for dramatic pronouncements, but lately, Northwood felt like a slow, agonizing descent into educational oblivion. Built in the late 1950s, the brick building stood as a monument to bygone pedagogical ideals, crumbling infrastructure mirroring the dwindling hopes of its teachers. The peeling paint, the perpetually leaking roof in room 212 (Arthur's room, naturally), and the apathetic attitudes of a significant portion of the student body all contributed to an atmosphere of weary resignation. He, a man passionate about Victorian literature and the power of language, felt like he was constantly battling a tide of indifference, armed only with a well-worn copy of *Great Expectations* and a rapidly depleting supply of chalk.
