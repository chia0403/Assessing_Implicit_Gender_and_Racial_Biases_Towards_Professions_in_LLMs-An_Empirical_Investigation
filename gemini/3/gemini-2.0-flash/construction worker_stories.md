Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a construction worker character:

**Opening:**

The air tasted of wet concrete and diesel, a flavor Elias Thorne had come to find oddly comforting. The sun, already a blazing accusation against the pale sky, beat down on the hard-packed dirt of the construction site. He wiped a streak of sweat from his forehead with the back of his calloused hand, leaving a muddy smear in its wake. The rhythmic clang of steel against steel, the whirring of the cement mixer, the shouts of his fellow workers - it was the symphony of progress, the soundtrack to his life. But today, the music was a little off-key. A knot of unease had settled low in his gut, a feeling as heavy and persistent as the steel girders they were hoisting into place.

**Setting:**

The story is set in Phoenix, Arizona, during the peak of a late-summer heatwave. Elias works on a high-rise construction site downtown. The skeletal frame of what will eventually be a luxury condominium tower dominates the skyline, a glittering promise of wealth and prosperity that feels a world away from the dusty realities of the job. The site is a cacophony of activity: cranes swinging massive loads, teams of workers maneuvering rebar, welders flashing like miniature suns, and the constant, grinding roar of machinery. In the distance, the shimmering haze of the city promises escape, but for Elias, itâ€™s just a reminder of the long, hot day ahead. The air is thick with the smells of dust, sweat, and freshly poured cement. The canteen is a metal shack baking in the sun. It offers lukewarm coffee and surprisingly resilient packaged sandwiches. It's a harsh, unforgiving environment where only the toughest survive.
