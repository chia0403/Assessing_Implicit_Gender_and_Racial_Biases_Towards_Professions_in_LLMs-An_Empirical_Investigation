## Story Opening:

The morning dew clung to Edgar Alistair Finch like a second skin, beading on his worn canvas overalls and clinging to the brim of his battered tweed hat. He squinted against the rising sun, a grizzled veteran of countless dawn awakenings, and surveyed his kingdom. It wasn't a particularly glamorous kingdom, mind you. No rolling hills or sparkling fountains here. Just the meticulously manicured lawns, rose bushes, and perpetually damp flagstones of St. Agatha's Asylum for the Chronically Eccentric.

Edgar sighed, a puff of frosty breath that vanished into the crisp autumn air. He'd seen more than his fair share of eccentric, chronically or otherwise, in his forty years tending this place. He knew each gargoyle by name, each withered branch of the ancient oak that guarded the main entrance, and, sadly, most of the residents by their particular brand of madness. But today, the air felt different. There was a tension in the rustling leaves, a stillness in the chirping birds, a weight that settled heavy in Edgar's chest. Something was amiss at St. Agatha's, and Edgar, with his intimate knowledge of every inch of the grounds, knew he'd be the first to find out.

## Setting:

**St. Agatha's Asylum for the Chronically Eccentric** is a sprawling Victorian gothic building perched on a windswept hill overlooking the small, unremarkable town of Havenwood. The asylum is surrounded by high stone walls, softened only by the creeping ivy that climbs its weathered face. The grounds are meticulously maintained, a stark contrast to the rumored chaos within the walls.

**Key details:**

*   **The Main Building:** A grey stone behemoth with imposing turrets, arched windows, and a general air of melancholic grandeur.
*   **The Gardens:** A formal arrangement of rose bushes, trimmed hedges, and gravel paths. A central fountain, usually dry, provides a focal point.
*   **The Oak:** An ancient, gnarled oak tree stands sentinel before the main entrance, its branches reaching towards the sky like skeletal fingers.
*   **The Outbuildings:** Several smaller buildings are scattered around the grounds, including a greenhouse, a tool shed (Edgar's domain), and a secluded gazebo.
*   **The Atmosphere:** The atmosphere is a mix of eerie tranquility and repressed energy. The silence is often broken by the distant cries of birds, the rustling of leaves, and the occasional, muffled outburst from within the asylum walls. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth, decaying leaves, and the faintest hint of disinfectant.
