## Story Opening:

The rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the shack, mimicking the frantic hammering in Amelia Hayes' chest. She pulled her threadbare shawl tighter, the damp wool offering little solace against the biting wind that whistled through the cracks in the walls. The smell of stale fish and desperation hung heavy in the air, a familiar aroma in these forgotten corners of the city.  Across the rickety table, a single bare bulb cast long, skeletal shadows on the face of her informant, a man known only as "Sparrow," his eyes darting nervously around the room as he spoke in hushed tones. "They don't want this getting out, Amelia. They'll bury it so deep, nobody will ever find it."

Amelia leaned forward, her pencil hovering above her notepad. "Then tell me, Sparrow. Tell me everything."

## Setting:

The story opens in **a dilapidated fishing shack on the fringes of Fisherman's Wharf in Providence, Rhode Island.**  The wharf, once a bustling hub of industry, is now a shadow of its former self, choked by neglected docks and crumbling buildings. A persistent fog, thick with the scent of brine and decay, clings to the area, lending it an air of melancholy and secrets. The shacks, inhabited by the last vestiges of the fishing community and those who have fallen through the cracks of society, are clustered precariously along the water's edge, their foundations slowly succumbing to the relentless tide. This forgotten corner of the city is a breeding ground for rumors, conspiracy, and whispers of things best left undisturbed.
