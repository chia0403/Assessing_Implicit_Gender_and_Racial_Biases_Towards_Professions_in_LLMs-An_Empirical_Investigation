## The Salty Siren

**Opening:**

Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of The Salty Siren, a relentless tattoo that mirrored the drumming in Elowen Ainsworth's chest. She wiped down the already spotless counter, the rhythm almost meditative, but tonight it couldn't soothe the gnawing anxiety that had been simmering beneath the surface all day. The air hung thick with the scent of stale beer, cheap tequila, and the faint, ever-present tang of the sea that permeated everything in Port Blossom.

**Setting:**

Port Blossom was a town clinging precariously to the edge of the Pacific, a place where the wildness of the ocean bled into the lives of its inhabitants. The Salty Siren, a weathered, single-story shack painted a faded turquoise, sat precariously on stilts above the rocky beach, practically daring the next king tide to sweep it away. Inside, the walls were adorned with faded nautical maps, mismatched fishing nets draped with dusty shells, and a collection of rusty, salvaged buoys. A single, flickering neon sign above the entrance crackled intermittently, its siren's tail missing a significant chunk.

The bar itself was long and worn smooth, its surface stained with years of spilled drinks and whispered secrets. Behind it, shelves groaned under the weight of various bottles, from the cheap rotgut favored by the local fishermen to the surprisingly expensive single malts occasionally requested by the tourists who stumbled in from the nearby highway. Dimly lit by a string of bare bulbs and a couple of oil lamps, The Salty Siren felt simultaneously cozy and claustrophobic, a haven for those seeking solace in a stiff drink and a familiar face. The salty air, always present, seeped in through the cracks in the walls, carrying the cries of gulls and the rhythmic crash of waves, a constant reminder of the untamed power that lay just beyond the flimsy walls.
