## The Story Opening:

Rain hammered against the revolving doors of the Grand Majestic Hotel, each metallic slap a miniature drum solo that competed with the already frantic tinkling of the lobby's Christmas music. Theodore Alistair Finch, dressed impeccably in his crimson and gold bell hop uniform, stood just inside the entrance, his gloved hands clasped behind his back. He watched a sleek black car pull up to the curb, its headlights cutting through the gloom like twin daggers. A woman, dripping with jewels and resentment, emerged, clutching a small, yapping dog in a handbag the size of a breadbox.

"About damn time," she snapped at the unseen driver before turning her attention, and her icy gaze, to Theodore. "Don't just stand there, boy. Get my luggage."

Theodore, used to such brusque greetings, offered a practiced, yet somehow still genuine, smile. "Of course, Madam. Welcome to the Grand Majestic. May I ask if you have reservations under a particular name?"

He already knew the answer. The Grand Majestic wasn't just any hotel. It was a stage where dramas of the wealthy and eccentric played out nightly, and Theodore, with his keen observation and uncanny memory, was often more than just an audience member. He was, sometimes, the stagehand, quietly shifting props behind the scenes.

## The Setting:

**The Grand Majestic Hotel, New York City, December 23rd, 1938.**

The hotel, a monument to art deco glamour, stood proudly on Fifth Avenue, a glittering beacon against the winter sky. Inside, the lobby was a symphony of polished marble, gleaming brass, and plush velvet. Towering Christmas trees, adorned with crystal ornaments and thousands of twinkling lights, stood sentinel on either side of the grand staircase. The air hung thick with the scent of expensive perfume, cigar smoke, and the subtle, almost metallic, tang of anticipation.

Beyond the lobby lay a labyrinth of luxurious suites, hidden bars, and secret passageways, each harboring its own secrets and its own cast of colorful characters. The Grand Majestic was a world unto itself, a gilded cage where the elite came to indulge their desires, escape their troubles, and, occasionally, commit acts that were best left forgotten. It was a place where appearances were everything, and truth was a rare and valuable commodity.
