## Story Opening:

The damp earth clung stubbornly to Finnian Alexander O'Connell's boots as he wrestled a reluctant rhododendron out of its plastic pot. Rain, a persistent drizzle rather than a proper downpour, plastered his dark, perpetually unruly hair to his forehead. He sighed, the sound lost in the hum of the nearby traffic and the aggressive chirp of a robin staking its claim to the freshly disturbed soil. Finnian hated rhododendrons. Hated their demanding thirst, their fussy need for acidic soil, and the way their blooms, while undeniably vibrant, were just a little *too* showy for his taste. Heâ€™d much rather be coaxing a delicate Japanese maple into its prime, or carefully pruning a rose bush to encourage a second, more fragrant bloom. But Mrs. Hawthorne wanted rhododendrons, and Mrs. Hawthorne paid well.

## Setting:

The year is 2023. Finnian is working in the back garden of a grand Victorian house on a quiet, tree-lined street in **Covington, Kentucky**. Covington sits just across the Ohio River from Cincinnati, offering a more relaxed, slightly bohemian alternative to its bustling neighbor. The house itself is painted a dignified grey, its ornate porch dripping with wisteria. The garden, once a meticulously manicured showpiece, has fallen into a state of charming disrepair. Overgrown rose bushes claw at the stone pathways, weeds bravely challenge the manicured lawn, and a venerable oak tree dominates the space, its branches casting long, dappled shadows. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth, decaying leaves, and the faint, metallic tang of the nearby river.
