## Story Opening & Setting:

**Story Opening:**

Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of the observation deck, blurring the majestic Andes into a grey, weeping smudge.  Isabella “Izzy” Rodriguez suppressed a sigh and plastered on a smile, the kind that said, "Don't worry, folks! Weather's just putting on a show for us!" Her voice, though, betrayed none of her apprehension as she addressed the huddled group of tourists, mostly retirees bundled in garish windbreakers. "Welcome, everyone, to the summit of Cerro San Cristóbal!  Even though the visibility isn't ideal today, you can usually see the entire city sprawled beneath us. Think of it as a mystical Chilean fog, adding a touch of intrigue to our adventure!  Now, let's talk about…vultures."

**Setting:**

The story is set in **Santiago, Chile**, specifically on the summit of **Cerro San Cristóbal**. The summit is a popular tourist destination, offering panoramic views of the city.  The observation deck is modern, enclosed in glass, offering protection from the elements, but still providing a sense of being exposed to the vastness of the surrounding landscape. The time of year is late autumn, hence the unpredictable and stormy weather. The overall atmosphere is one of a vibrant city struggling against a dramatic and ever-changing natural environment.  Think bustling urban life juxtaposed with the imposing, snow-capped Andes in the backdrop, and the frequent, dramatic shifts in weather that can transform a clear, sunny day into a blustery, rain-soaked one in a matter of hours.
