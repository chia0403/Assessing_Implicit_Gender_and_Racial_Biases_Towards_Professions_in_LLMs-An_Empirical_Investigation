## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights of Friedman & Davies buzzed overhead, casting a sterile glow on Amelia "Amy" Harding's overflowing inbox. 8:03 AM. She was already three minutes behind schedule and buried under a mountain of discovery requests. Swallowing the last of her lukewarm coffee, she clicked open the email from Mr. Friedman himself, a man whose pronouncements could alter the trajectory of her day with the capricious force of a rogue asteroid. Her stomach clenched. Subject: "Urgent: Henderson Case - Immediate Attention." This couldn't be good. Just yesterday, she'd finally managed to wrestle the Henderson deposition transcripts into some semblance of order, a feat that had involved more caffeine and whispered threats than she cared to admit. What fresh hell awaited her now?
## Setting:

The setting is the law office of Friedman & Davies, a mid-sized firm specializing in corporate litigation, located in downtown Chicago. The office occupies the 27th and 28th floors of a sleek, modern skyscraper. Amelia's cubicle, a cramped space nestled between the break room and the senior partner's corner office, reflects her personality: meticulously organized chaos. Stacks of legal documents threaten to spill over the edges of her desk, but each file is labeled and color-coded with an almost obsessive precision. Post-it notes, scribbled with reminders and case citations, cling to her monitor like barnacles. A framed photo of her rescued terrier, "Judge Judy," offers a brief respite from the relentless grayness. The overall atmosphere is one of high pressure and hushed intensity, punctuated by the rhythmic click-clack of keyboards and the muffled voices of lawyers locked in tense phone calls. Outside the panoramic windows, the city stretches out, a vast and intricate network of concrete and steel, a constant reminder of the stakes involved in their daily legal battles.
