## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The biting November wind whipped across the flat expanse of Eastern Montana, clawing at the clapboard siding of the Miles City Rural Health Clinic. Inside, the waiting room was a haven of warm yellow light, the air thick with the comforting smell of antiseptic and stale coffee. A half-dead Christmas cactus sat stubbornly blooming on the reception desk, a splash of defiant color against the muted browns and beiges. Outside, the sky threatened snow, a low, grey blanket pressing down on the landscape.

**Opening:**

The frantic beep of the emergency call line ripped through the Monday morning quiet, making Mildred “Millie” Mae Holcomb, Physician’s Assistant, jump. She was halfway through charting on Mrs. Henderson’s bunion removal, the satisfying click of the stapler echoing in her small, cluttered office. Millie sighed, pushing her reading glasses further up her nose. Mondays were always unpredictable in Miles City, but a premature emergency call usually meant someone had fallen off a horse, or, worse, a tractor.

She reached for the blinking phone with a practiced hand. "Miles City Rural Health, this is Millie speaking, how can I help you?"

A breathless voice crackled on the other end, thick with panic. "Ma'am, it's... it's Jimmy. He's... he's been bit. By a dog. A big one. And he's... well, he ain't lookin' so good."
