The stale cigarette smoke hung heavy in the air, clinging to the tattered velvet armchair like a desperate lover. Rain hammered against the grimy window of Beatrice "Bea" Bellweather's office, mimicking the relentless drumming in her head. The neon sign outside, advertising "BEATRICE BELLWEATHER - PRIVATE INVESTIGATIONS," flickered sporadically, casting long, distorted shadows across the room. Bea, a woman whose sharp wit was only rivaled by her equally sharp angles and perpetual five o'clock shadow (even at 10:00 AM), was staring out at the downpour.

Bea's office was located on the third floor of the Oakhaven Building, a crumbling Art Deco monstrosity that had seen better days â€“ much like Bea herself, she often thought. The building sat squarely in the heart of Oakhaven's "historic" district, which was a polite way of saying it was where the city housed its less desirable businesses and residents. Down below, in the street slick with rain, the usual cast of characters shuffled by: a couple of panhandlers arguing over territory, a street musician miserably playing a melancholic tune on a dented trumpet, and a lone rat, scurrying along the overflowing gutter. Oakhaven, Pennsylvania, was Bea Bellweather's stomping ground, and she knew its secrets like the back of her calloused hand. Tonight, however, Oakhaven felt particularly oppressive, the city's damp chill seeping into Bea's bones.
