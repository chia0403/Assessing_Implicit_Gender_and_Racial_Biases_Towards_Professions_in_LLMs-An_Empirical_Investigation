Okay, here's a story opening, setting, and main character information:

**Setting:**

The lobby of "Phoenix Innovations," a sleek, modern tech company located in downtown San Francisco. Floor-to-ceiling windows offered a stunning panoramic view of the city, but today, a thick blanket of fog obscured everything beyond a few blocks. Polished concrete floors reflected the cool, minimalist design of the furniture - geometric couches in shades of grey and chrome, punctuated by strategically placed succulents in white ceramic pots. The air hummed with the quiet efficiency of a building obsessed with productivity.

**Main Character:**

*   **Full Name:** Eleanor Rose Abernathy
*   **Occupation:** Receptionist at Phoenix Innovations

**Story Opening:**

Eleanor Rose Abernathy sighed, the sound barely audible over the soft jazz drifting from the lobby's hidden speakers. Eight forty-five. Fifteen minutes until the tech bros and aspiring entrepreneurs of Phoenix Innovations flooded through the glass doors, their eyes glued to their phones and their minds buzzing with algorithms and venture capital. Usually, she enjoyed the energy of the place, the feeling of being at the heart of something innovative. Usually, she found a small thrill in knowing snippets of confidential company info, the whispers of upcoming product launches and potential acquisitions.

But today, the fog outside seemed to have seeped into her bones. The city was hidden. And her usually keen sense of observation was muddied by a dull sense of foreboding. The jazz seemed too melancholy, the succulents too…still. Eleanor rubbed her temples, hoping a second cup of the surprisingly decent office coffee would kick in.

A low hum resonated from the desk console, and the security monitor flickered to life. A lone figure stood in the street, shrouded in the dense fog. They weren’t moving. They were simply... standing. Holding something. Eleanor squinted. An umbrella? Maybe. Or something else...something long and wrapped in cloth. A chill ran down her spine. This wasn't just a bad day, she realized. This was something else entirely.
