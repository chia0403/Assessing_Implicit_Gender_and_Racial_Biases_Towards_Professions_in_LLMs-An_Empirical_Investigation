## Story Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield sighed, the sound a dry rustle of defeated paperwork echoing in the tiny, windowless office. It was April 14th, the day before the monstrous beast of Tax Day devoured the hopes and dreams of middle-class America. His back ached, his eyes burned, and the aroma of stale coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air. He could hear Mrs. Gabblethorpe, his next appointment, clearing her throat impatiently on the other side of the thin plywood door. Barty steeled himself, adjusting the tie that strangled his neck. One more return. One more year of navigating the labyrinthine complexities of Form 1040. One more day closer to…well, he didn’t actually know *what* he was closer to. Retirement seemed as fantastical as landing on Mars. He just wanted the pounding in his head to stop.

**Setting:**

The setting is a cramped, dimly lit office located on the second floor of a faded strip mall in the otherwise charming, albeit slightly economically depressed, town of Harmony Glade, Pennsylvania. The office, christened "Butterfield's Balanced Books" (a title Bartholomew had regretted since day one), is a testament to frugality bordering on abject poverty. The walls are painted a sickly beige, punctuated by a motivational poster featuring a smiling eagle soaring over a mountain range with the phrase "Soar to Success!" printed beneath. The furniture is a mismatched collection of thrift store finds: a wobbly desk overflowing with tax forms, a creaky swivel chair held together with duct tape, and a couple of plastic chairs that are perpetually sticky with something unknown. The only source of natural light comes from a grimy skylight, which casts a weak, greyish glow onto the piles of paperwork. A perpetually sputtering fluorescent light fixture buzzes overhead, adding to the overall sense of unease and impending doom. The air is thick with the scent of cheap coffee, printer ink, and the faint, lingering aroma of desperation. Harmony Glade, just outside of Pittsburgh, is a town trying to hold onto its past while the future speeds right by it. This strip mall, once vibrant, now houses a struggling laundromat, a discount shoe store, and Barty's barely-keeping-afloat tax preparation business.
