## Story Opening:

The biting wind whipped at Dr. Amelia Reyes’ exposed cheeks as she knelt beside the prone figure. The air, thick with the metallic tang of blood and the sharp scent of pine, stung her nostrils. Overhead, the towering redwoods swayed ominously, their silhouettes clawing at the rapidly darkening sky. Amelia’s gloved fingers worked quickly, feeling for a pulse in the young woman’s neck, the icy fear that was a familiar, unwelcome companion creeping up her spine.

“Pulse is weak but present,” she barked, her voice raspy, more for herself than for the two volunteer search and rescue team members huddled nearby. “BP cuff! And someone get me a better light. I can barely see a damn thing.”

The beam from a headlamp sliced through the gloom, illuminating the victim’s pale face, streaked with mud and blood. Her leg was twisted at an unnatural angle, clearly broken, and her breathing was shallow and ragged. This was the third hiker lost in the Redwood National and State Parks in as many months, and Amelia was starting to hate this place, despite the breathtaking beauty that clung to it like a shroud.
## Setting:

**Redwood National and State Parks, Northern California:** The setting is dominated by ancient redwood forests, with towering trees that blot out much of the sunlight. The terrain is rugged and uneven, with steep ravines, dense undergrowth, and winding trails. The weather is often unpredictable, prone to sudden shifts in temperature, fog, and rain, even during the summer months. The isolated nature of the park makes communication difficult, and emergency services can take a significant amount of time to reach remote areas. The overall atmosphere is one of both immense beauty and inherent danger.
