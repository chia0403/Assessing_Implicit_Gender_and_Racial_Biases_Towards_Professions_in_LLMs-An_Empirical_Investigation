**Story Opening:**

The air in the office hung thick with the scent of desperation, a scent Amelia Grace Thornton knew all too well. It clung to the chipped laminate of her desk, wafted from the lukewarm coffee in her chipped mug, and even seemed to emanate from her own perpetually-stressed pores. Today, however, the desperation was particularly potent, almost tangible. It crackled in the forced cheerfulness of her coworker, Brenda, who was meticulously watering the plastic fern, and hummed in the low, guttural sobs coming from the conference room down the hall.

Amelia sighed, swiveling in her creaky office chair. Rain lashed against the window of Thornton & Sons Insurance, blurring the already drab view of downtown Cedar Creek, Iowa. Perfect weather for dwelling on misfortune, she thought with a grimace. It was days like these that made her question everything she thought she knew about the world. Days like these, she wanted to be anything but an insurance agent.

**Setting:**

The story is set in **Cedar Creek, Iowa**, a small, Midwestern town known for its annual corn festival and its surprising number of antique shops. Amelia Grace Thornton works for **Thornton & Sons Insurance**, a local insurance agency that has been in her family for three generations.

The agency itself is housed in a two-story brick building on Main Street. The interior is a blend of old and new. The front lobby boasts original oak paneling and a charmingly outdated receptionist desk, while the back offices are a maze of cubicles, each decorated with varying degrees of personality. Amelia's office is located near the back, a cramped space dominated by a large, overflowing filing cabinet and a framed photograph of her late grandfather, the founder of the agency, staring down at her with disapproving eyes. The overall atmosphere is one of quiet diligence mixed with a pervasive sense of being slightly behind schedule.
