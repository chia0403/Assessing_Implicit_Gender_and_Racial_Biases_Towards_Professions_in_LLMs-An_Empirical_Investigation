The biting March wind, sharp as a newly-honed shears, whipped around the corner of Bleak Street, rattling the ill-fitting window of Alistair Finch's tailoring shop, "A Stitch in Time." Alistair, his fingers perpetually pricked and calloused, shivered in his worn wool waistcoat, though the small, pot-bellied stove in the corner of the shop belched a meager attempt at warmth. Dust motes danced in the weak sunlight filtering through the grimy glass, illuminating rolls of tweed and velvet stacked precariously along the walls.

Alistair, a man whose own clothing often resembled the cast-offs he hoped to transform, chewed on the end of his well-worn spectacles as he examined a fraying hem of a nobleman's coat. His thin, grey hair, usually tamed with a liberal application of pomade, had escaped its moorings, creating a halo of static around his head. He hummed a mournful tune under his breath, the same tune his grandmother, a seamstress of legendary skill, used to sing while he threaded needles as a child.

Bleak Street, nestled in the labyrinthine back alleys of the sprawling city of Atheria, was a haven for the downtrodden and the eccentric. Across the street, Mrs. Periwinkle, the fortune teller, was already lighting her incense, the acrid smoke promising to offend the noses of anyone within a ten-foot radius. Further down, Mr. Grimshaw, the reclusive clockmaker, hammered away at some unseen mechanism, the rhythmic clang echoing through the narrow passage like a heartbeat. Here, amongst the forgotten and the forlorn, Alistair Finch carved out a meager living, mending the rents and tears of the city's inhabitants, one stitch at a time.
