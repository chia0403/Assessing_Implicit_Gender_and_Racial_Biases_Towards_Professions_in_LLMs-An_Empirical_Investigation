The chipped mug, lukewarm and stained with the ghosts of a dozen previous coffees, warmed Eliza Maeve Callahan’s hands more than its contents warmed her insides. Outside, the relentless Portland drizzle hammered against the oversized windowpanes of The Book Nook, a haven for forgotten stories nestled in the heart of Hawthorne. Sunlight, a rare and precious commodity in this corner of Oregon, hadn't deigned to make an appearance in days, leaving the shop bathed in the perpetual amber glow of antique lamps and the comforting scent of aged paper.

Eliza, a writer grappling with both a formidable case of writer's block and an even more formidable student loan debt, often found herself drawn to the cafe section of The Book Nook. It offered a quiet refuge, a place where the murmur of turning pages and the clinking of ceramic on ceramic could soothe her frayed nerves, even if it couldn't quite conjure up the spark she needed to finish her damn novel. She stared at the half-empty screen of her laptop, the blinking cursor mocking her creative paralysis. Chapter six remained stubbornly incomplete, the plot threads tangled in a frustrating knot she couldn't seem to unravel. Today, however, even the comforting ambience of The Book Nook felt…oppressive. The weight of unwritten words, the looming deadline, and the incessant drumming of the rain conspired to make Eliza feel like she was drowning in a sea of literary expectations.
