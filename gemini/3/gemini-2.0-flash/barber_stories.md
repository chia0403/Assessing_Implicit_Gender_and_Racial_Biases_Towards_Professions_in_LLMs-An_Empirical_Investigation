Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a barber:

**Story Opening:**

The rhythmic snick of the shears was the only sound competing with the crackling static emanating from the vintage radio perched precariously on the shelf above the mirror. Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins, a man whose hands knew the contours of every jawline in Oakhaven, paused mid-snip, tilting his head towards the broadcast. Usually, he’d be humming along to whatever old-timey tune the station was pumping out, but this…this was different. An urgent news bulletin, laced with static hiss and the tremor of the announcer's voice, cut through the midday calm.

"…reports are flooding in from across the state…unidentified aerial phenomena…authorities are urging citizens to remain calm…"

Bart frowned, wiping a stray strand of grey hair from his brow with the back of his hand. Another UFO scare? He'd seen a few of those come and go in his sixty-three years, and they usually amounted to nothing more than weather balloons and attention-seeking kooks. He glanced at Mr. Abernathy in the chair, whose eyes, magnified by his thick spectacles, were wide with a mixture of fear and fascination.

"Just ignore it, Harold," Bart said, resuming his work. "Probably just some teenagers with drones." But a small knot of unease tightened in his stomach. He'd lived in Oakhaven his whole life. Things didn't usually happen *here*. And the way the announcer had sounded…it was enough to give a man pause, even a seasoned barber like Bartholomew Higgins.
**Setting:**

Bart's Barber Shop, located on the corner of Elm Street and Maple Avenue in the quiet, almost painfully quaint town of Oakhaven, nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. The shop itself was a time capsule, virtually unchanged since Bart's father had first opened its doors back in 1952.

The interior was a comforting blend of faded green paint, worn linoleum, and the lingering scent of bay rum and talcum powder. Two well-worn barber chairs, upholstered in cracked, faded red leather, dominated the space. A long, speckled mirror stretched the length of one wall, reflecting the faces of generations who had come seeking a trim and a bit of local gossip.

Magazine racks, overflowing with dog-eared copies of Field & Stream and Popular Mechanics from the late 1980s and early 90s, stood sentinel beside the chairs.  A dusty collection of shaving mugs, each bearing the name of a former Oakhaven resident, lined a shelf above the mirror – a silent testament to the town's history and Bart's long tenure as its resident tonsorial artist. Sunlight streamed through the large front window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and casting a warm glow on the faded posters advertising Brylcreem and Wildroot hair tonic. The overall feeling was one of comfortable familiarity, a place where time seemed to slow down and the worries of the world faded into the background…until today.
