## Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

The rhythmic hum of the fluorescent lights in the guidance office was a lullaby to Ms. Amelia Beatrice Thorne, a comforting drone she'd grown accustomed to over the past twelve years. She’d learned to tune it out, a necessary skill when fielding teenage anxieties on a daily basis. But today, even the hum felt amplified, a vibrating undercurrent to the knot of apprehension tightening in her stomach. It was Monday morning, report cards were due, and Amelia already knew that half her office hours would be spent navigating the treacherous waters of parental expectations and student disappointment.

She took a long sip of her lukewarm coffee, the taste bitter against her tongue. Glancing at the clock – 7:58 AM – she straightened the stack of neatly arranged appointment slips on her desk, each bearing the name of a student whose future, in some small way, felt entrusted to her. Today, that responsibility felt heavier than usual.

**Setting:**

Northwood High, a sprawling brick building with a disproportionate number of trophies crammed into its display case, was situated in the affluent suburb of Willow Creek. It was a place where academic pressure was as pervasive as the perfectly manicured lawns, and where the unspoken competition to get into the "right" college could be as brutal as any battlefield. Ms. Thorne's office, located in a quiet corner of the first floor, was an oasis of relative calm. The walls were painted a soothing shade of lavender, adorned with posters showcasing various colleges and inspirational quotes about pursuing dreams. A comfortable, slightly worn, armchair sat in the corner, inviting hesitant students to sink in and share their burdens. The scent of chamomile tea, perpetually brewing in a small electric kettle on a side table, hung in the air, a subtle attempt to counteract the sterile atmosphere. Despite the carefully curated ambiance, the office, like Northwood High itself, was a microcosm of the pressures and anxieties that plagued its students. It was a place where dreams were both nurtured and, sometimes, quietly crushed.
