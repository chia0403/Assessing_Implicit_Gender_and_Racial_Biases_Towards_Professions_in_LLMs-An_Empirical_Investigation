## Story Opening:

The stale coffee clinging to the inside of Earl "Rusty" Callahan's thermos tasted like burnt dreams and the relentless grind of eighteen wheels against asphalt. Outside, dawn bled across the vast expanse of the Arizona desert, painting the saguaros in hues of fiery orange and bruised purple. Rusty squinted, his eyes gritty from a night spent battling a wicked crosswind and the incessant chatter of his CB radio. He'd been pushing hard, trying to make up lost time after a busted fuel pump in Amarillo. Now, with the sun finally creeping over the horizon, a bone-deep weariness settled in, threatening to pull him under like quicksand.

He glanced at the dashboard clock. 5:47 AM. Almost there. He just needed to make it to the Flying J in Kingman. A hot shower, a real breakfast, and maybe, just maybe, a few hours of solid sleep before tackling the last leg to Vegas. He gripped the steering wheel tighter, urging his Kenworth, "The Iron Lady," forward. Today wasn't just about delivering his load of avocados. Today was about surviving another goddamn run.

## Setting:

The story begins in the early hours of the morning, just outside of Kingman, Arizona. The landscape is typical high desert: scrub brush, cacti of varying sizes, and rocky outcrops that jut from the arid ground. The air is crisp and dry, with a subtle scent of sage and dust. The highway, a ribbon of cracked asphalt, stretches endlessly into the distance, shimmering with heat even in the pre-dawn chill. The only signs of civilization are the occasional rusted-out car carcass baking in the sun and the distant, faint glow of Kingman's lights on the horizon. The overall mood is one of stark beauty, isolation, and the enduring spirit of those who navigate this unforgiving terrain.
