## Story Opening:

The air in "The Cleaver's Cut" hung thick with the metallic tang of blood, a smell Elias Thorne had long grown accustomed to. It was a Tuesday, early, the kind of morning where the weak winter sun barely managed to pierce the frosted window, painting the sawdust-covered floor in pale stripes. Elias stood hunched over a side of beef, his brow furrowed in concentration. The cleaver, heavy and well-worn, felt like an extension of his own hand. He hummed a low, tuneless melody, a counterpoint to the rhythmic thud as he expertly separated a sirloin, the blade singing a sharp song with each precise stroke. He was trying to coax the perfect cut, the kind that would melt in your mouth, and drown out the persistent echo in his head: the hollow, accusing silence that had settled over his life since the old woman had died.

## Setting:

The story takes place in the small, isolated town of Havenwood, nestled in the foothills of the misty Blackwood Mountains. Havenwood is a town steeped in tradition, where secrets fester beneath a veneer of quaint charm. "The Cleaver's Cut," Elias Thorne's butcher shop, sits on the corner of Main Street, its weathered wooden facade a testament to decades of operation. Inside, the shop is a sensory experience. The pungent aromas of smoked meats, freshly ground spices, and the ever-present iron scent of blood mingle in the air. Rows of sausages hang from hooks, casting long shadows under the flickering fluorescent lights. The walls are lined with vintage meat thermometers and faded posters showcasing prize-winning livestock. The heavy oak counter, stained and scarred from years of use, separates Elias from his customers, a tangible barrier between the private world of his butchery and the gossip-filled lives of Havenwood's residents. Beyond the main shop floor lies the chill room, a cavernous space dominated by a massive walk-in freezer, where sides of beef and lamb hang like macabre sculptures, waiting for Elias's skilled hand to transform them. The air in the chill room is perpetually damp and biting, a constant reminder of the coldness that seems to pervade Havenwood, both literally and figuratively.
