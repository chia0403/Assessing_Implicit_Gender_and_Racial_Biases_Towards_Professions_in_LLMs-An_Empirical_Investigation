## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The sun bled across the horizon, painting the endless fields of golden wheat in hues of fiery orange and dusky rose. Dust motes danced in the air, kicked up by the day's harvest, as the wind, a weary sigh, whispered through the tall stalks.

**Story Opening:**

The last rays of sunlight glinted off the grime etched into the weathered lines of Silas Bartholomew Oakhaven's face. He leaned against the side of his rusted-out combine harvester, the engine finally silenced after a fourteen-hour shift. His back ached, his hands were calloused beyond feeling, and his throat felt like he'd swallowed the entire harvest whole.

He pulled a worn, leather-bound journal from his back pocket, the pages filled with rows of numbers and faded ink, and sighed. Another day closer to the edge.
