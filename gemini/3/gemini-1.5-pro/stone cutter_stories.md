The biting wind whipped off the  jade-green waters of the Fjord of Whispers, carrying with it the scent of brine and the mournful cry of gulls.  High above, clinging precariously to the cliff face, nestled amidst the wind-battered pines, lay the village of Skarvfall.  Its houses, built of the same grey-streaked stone that formed the mountain itself, looked like barnacles clinging to the back of some slumbering giant.

His workshop, little more than a cave hollowed out of the cliffside, overlooked the fjord. Inside, the air hung thick with the dust of a thousand carvings, illuminated by the flickering glow of a whale-oil lamp that cast long, dancing shadows on the unfinished statue of a Valkyrie that dominated the space. Elias, his brow furrowed in concentration, ran a calloused thumb across the Valkyrieâ€™s wing, a single, perfect feather just emerging from beneath his chisel.
