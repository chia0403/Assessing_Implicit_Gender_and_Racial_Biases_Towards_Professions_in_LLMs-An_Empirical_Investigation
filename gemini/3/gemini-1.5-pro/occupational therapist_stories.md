The biting November wind whipped around Amelia "Amy" Rose Hawthorne as she wrestled the heavy clinic door shut.  Rain, half-frozen into sleet, lashed against the large window overlooking the bleak, industrial landscape of Grimsby, England.  Inside, the fluorescent lights hummed, casting a sterile glow over the sparsely decorated waiting room.  Amy, her fingers already numb despite her thick wool gloves, peeled them off and rubbed them together, the sound oddly loud in the otherwise silent clinic.  A lone, wilting pot plant sat on a small table beside a stack of outdated magazines, the only splash of colour in the room.  It was 5:47 pm, three minutes past her official closing time, and Amy was bone-tired.  The Grimsby Rehabilitation Clinic wasn't glamorous, but it was hers, and tonight, all she wanted was a hot cup of tea and the comforting crackle of the fireplace in her small flat overlooking the docks.
