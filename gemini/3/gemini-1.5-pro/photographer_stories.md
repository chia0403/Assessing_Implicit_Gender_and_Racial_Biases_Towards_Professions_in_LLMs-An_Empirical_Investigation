The biting November wind whipped Amelia Reyes’s dark curls across her face as she leaned precariously from the fire escape, her vintage Rolleiflex clutched tight.  Five stories below, the neon glow of Hong Kong’s Kowloon Walled City market spilled onto the slick, rain-washed streets, painting the teeming crowds in a kaleidoscope of electric hues.  Amelia breathed in the heady mix of fish sauce, diesel fumes, and jasmine tea, a familiar, comforting aroma that belied the city’s chaotic energy.  She adjusted the focus, framing the scene: a wizened fortune teller with a cage full of chirping finches, her face illuminated by a dangling paper lantern, juxtaposed against the stark, brutalist architecture of a looming public housing block.

Tonight, however, a different kind of thread was about to weave itself into the fabric of her life, a thread of danger and intrigue that threatened to unravel everything she held dear.
