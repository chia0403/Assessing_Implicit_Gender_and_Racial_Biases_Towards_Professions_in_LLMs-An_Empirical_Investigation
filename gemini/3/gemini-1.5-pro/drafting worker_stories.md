The flickering fluorescent lights of the D&M Architectural firm buzzed in Amelia Reyes's ears, a soundtrack as familiar to her as her own heartbeat.  It was a Thursday in late November, the kind of grey, gnawing cold that seeped through the Chicago brick and settled deep in the bones. Outside, the wind howled down LaSalle Street, rattling the large plate-glass windows that showcased the firm’s more glamorous projects – sleek high-rises and sprawling suburban estates. Inside, however, the air was thick with the scent of stale coffee and the low hum of concentration. Amelia, hunched over her drafting table in the back corner, a space affectionately nicknamed “The Dungeon” by the junior staff, squinted at the intricate blueprint spread before her.  Her pencil, a perfectly sharpened 2H, danced across the vellum, adding another minute detail to the sprawling floorplan of a new community center planned for the South Side.  She loved this part, the quiet precision of bringing an architect’s vision to life, one meticulous line at a time. But today, a knot of unease tightened in her stomach, a feeling as persistent as the Chicago wind. It wasn't the deadline looming over the community center project, though that was certainly a factor.  No, this was something else, a premonition humming just beneath the surface, a feeling that something was about to change.
