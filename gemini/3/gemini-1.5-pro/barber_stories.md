The flickering neon sign of "Finnian O'Malley's Tonsorial Parlour" cast a lurid, electric green glow across the rain-slicked cobblestones of Arkham End.  It was a narrow, crooked alleyway, pinched between a crumbling apothecary and a perpetually shuttered bookshop with dusty windows.  The air hung thick and heavy, not just with the oppressive humidity of a late July evening, but with a peculiar, cloying sweetness that hinted at something more sinister than mere summer decay. Finnian O'Malley himself, a man whose age was as difficult to determine as the precise ingredients of the tonic he used for his signature hot towel shave, stood in the doorway of his shop, watching the downpour with a detached, almost melancholic expression. His usually pristine white barberâ€™s coat was speckled with raindrops, and the single gas lamp above his head buzzed with an insistent, almost frantic energy, reflecting in his deep-set, unsettlingly pale eyes.  Arkham End was a place where secrets festered like mold in damp cellars, and Finnian, with his razor-sharp wit and even sharper blades, was privy to more than his fair share.
