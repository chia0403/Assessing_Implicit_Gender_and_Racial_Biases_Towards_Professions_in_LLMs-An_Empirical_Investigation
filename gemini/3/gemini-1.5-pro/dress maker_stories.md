The clatter of horse-drawn carriages on cobblestones was a familiar lullaby to  Genevieve Augustine Dufresne.  Her atelier, perched above a bustling bakery on Rue de l'Aiguille in 1888 Paris, was a haven of quiet amidst the cityâ€™s ceaseless hum. Sunlight, filtered through the large paned windows overlooking the street, illuminated swathes of silk, satin, and lace strewn across her work table. Genevieve, her dark hair pinned up in a loose chignon, traced the delicate pattern of a butterfly onto a length of ivory chiffon, the faint scent of almond croissants wafting up from the bakery below.  Autumn had just begun to kiss the leaves of the plane trees lining the street, painting them in hues of gold and russet, mirroring the colours of the upcoming season's fashion, which Genevieve, with her impeccable eye, was already anticipating.  A small bell jingled, announcing a customer, and Genevieve looked up, a welcoming smile gracing her lips.  Little did she know that the woman about to enter her atelier would irrevocably alter the course of her life, not with a request for a ballgown, but with a whispered plea for something far more dangerous: a disguise.
