The linoleum floor of the Sunnyside Daycare center, perpetually sticky despite Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez's best efforts, gleamed under the harsh fluorescent lights.  It was 6:45 am, the sun barely peeking over the horizon, painting the sky in bruised purples and hesitant oranges.  Amy, her dark hair pulled back in a messy bun secured by a crayon-decorated butterfly clip, surveyed her domain. Tiny plastic chairs were stacked neatly on miniature tables, waiting for the impending onslaught of glitter, glue, and the boundless energy of toddlers. The air smelled faintly of stale apple juice and disinfectant â€“ the official aroma of Sunnyside.  Outside, the sleepy town of Willow Creek, Oregon, was just beginning to stir, oblivious to the controlled chaos about to erupt within the brightly painted walls of the daycare.
