The bell above the door of "Petal & Stem" jingled merrily, a counterpoint to the drumming of rain against the large storefront window.  Inside, amidst the riotous perfume of lilies, roses, and freesia, Elara Thistlewick hummed along to a Billie Holiday record, her nimble fingers weaving sprigs of eucalyptus into a funeral wreath. The shop, nestled on a cobbled side street in the perpetually misty town of Port Blossom, Oregon, was a haven of vibrant color against the gray backdrop of the Pacific Northwest.  Rain or shine, Petal & Stem was Elaraâ€™s sanctuary, a place where she could lose herself in the language of flowers, each bloom whispering secrets she understood implicitly.  This morning, however, the whispers felt different, tinged with an unfamiliar unease.
