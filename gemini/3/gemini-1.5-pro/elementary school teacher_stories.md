The pungent aroma of stale coffee and damp wool hung heavy in the air of Ms. Eleanor Ainsworth's classroom.  Rain lashed against the large, grimy windows of Maplewood Elementary, blurring the already dreary November landscape into a swirling grey mess.  Inside, a fluorescent light buzzed erratically, casting a sickly yellow glow over the rows of miniature desks and chairs. Paper snowflakes, remnants of a prematurely optimistic October art project, clung precariously to the peeling paint of the walls. Eleanor, her normally vibrant hazel eyes shadowed with exhaustion, surveyed the room.  It was 7:15 am, a full forty-five minutes before the cacophony of twenty-five second graders would descend, and yet the air already felt thick with the promise of chaos.  Maplewood, nestled in the heart of a forgotten mill town in western Massachusetts, wasn't exactly known for its well-funded school system, and Eleanor's classroom, much like the town itself, wore its weariness openly.
