The humid Miami air hung thick and heavy, even at 6:00 am.  Dew clung to the lush green fronds of the palm trees lining Ocean Drive, mirroring the sheen of sweat already gathering on Amelia “Amy” Rodriguez’s forehead.  Amy, clad in vibrant coral leggings and a matching sports bra, adjusted her headset microphone and bounced lightly on the balls of her feet.  The turquoise waves of the Atlantic crashed rhythmically against the shore just yards from her makeshift outdoor studio – a raised wooden platform overlooking South Pointe Park.  Twenty brightly coloured yoga mats, arranged in a neat semi-circle, awaited the arrival of her sunrise "Booty Blast" class, a high-intensity workout promising sculpted glutes and a killer cardio burn.  A portable speaker blared upbeat Latin music, its rhythm pulsing through the otherwise quiet morning air, a siren song for the fitness-focused denizens of South Beach. Amy, however, was distracted.  A crumpled flyer, tucked under the corner of her water bottle, caught her eye.  It advertised a missing person, a young woman last seen in the very park where Amy now stood.  The woman’s eyes, staring back from the faded photograph, seemed to bore into Amy’s soul.
