The bell above the door of "Nailed It," tinkled a discordant melody as Mrs. Agatha Periwinkle, draped in a mink stole despite the July humidity, bustled inside.  Eliza Jane Higgins, whose name was embroidered in elegant cursive on her crisp white apron, looked up from the meticulous filing she was performing on a client's chipped "Ballet Slippers" pink.  Nailed It was Eliza Jane's sanctuary, a small, vibrant salon nestled between a laundromat and a dubious-looking psychic on Bleecker Street in the West Village.  Sunlight, filtered through the large front window, danced across the rows of nail polish bottles, arranged in a rainbow spectrum that would make any Instagram influencer swoon.  The air hung thick with the sweet, acrid scent of acetone and the promise of transformation.  Outside, the relentless hum of New York City traffic provided a constant, if somewhat jarring, soundtrack to Eliza Jane's carefully curated world of perfect cuticles and expertly applied glitter.
