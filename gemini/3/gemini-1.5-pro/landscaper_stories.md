The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's auburn braid across her face as she surveyed the skeletal remains of Mrs. Periwinkle's prized rose garden.  Frost crunched under her steel-toed boots, the sound a stark contrast to the riot of colour that had exploded here just a few short months ago.  Towering oaks, stripped bare by autumn, clawed at the overcast sky above the rambling Victorian house in the affluent suburb of Oakhaven, Illinois.  Amy pulled her thick wool gloves tighter, a faint smell of woodsmoke clinging to the air, hinting at cozy fireplaces within the grand homes that lined the street.  This was the last garden on her fall cleanup list, and frankly, Amy was looking forward to trading her pruning shears for a steaming mug of hot chocolate. But Mrs. Periwinkle, a woman whose personality was as thorny as her prize-winning 'Black Baccara' roses, was nowhere to be seen, and Amy knew from experience that the woman had a precise vision for how every fallen leaf should be handled.
