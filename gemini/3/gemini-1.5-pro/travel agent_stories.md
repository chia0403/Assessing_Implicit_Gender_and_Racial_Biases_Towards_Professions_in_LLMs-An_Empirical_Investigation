The insistent chirping of a gecko, hidden somewhere amidst the overflowing philodendrons, was the only sound that dared interrupt the humid stillness of the afternoon.  Amelia “Amy” Reyes, her name tag slightly askew on her crisp white blouse, sighed and tapped a manicured nail against the worn laminate of her desk.  Her travel agency, "Wanderlust Whispers," occupied a small, sun-drenched corner unit in a dilapidated strip mall nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed fortune teller's parlor in Key Largo, Florida. Salt air, tinged with the faint aroma of bleach from next door, drifted through the open doorway, carrying with it the promise of escape – a promise Amy peddled daily, yet rarely experienced herself.  Outside, the turquoise waters of the Florida Straits shimmered invitingly under the relentless July sun, a stark contrast to the faded travel posters and dusty brochures that cluttered her office.  Amy dreamt of the far-flung destinations they depicted, but her reality was firmly rooted in this small, somewhat sticky corner of paradise, booking honeymoons for lovestruck couples and arranging fishing trips for sunburnt retirees.
