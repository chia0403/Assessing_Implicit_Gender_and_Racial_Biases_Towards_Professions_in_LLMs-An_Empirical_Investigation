The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorne, plastering his salt-and-pepper hair against his forehead. He tugged his threadbare scarf tighter, the wool scratching against his stubble. Below him, the lights of Reykjavik shimmered, a constellation of orange and white against the encroaching Icelandic dusk. Elias, perched precariously on the edge of Hallgrímskirkja's viewing platform, wasn't admiring the cityscape.  His gaze was fixed on the bruised, swirling clouds churning above the Faxaflói bay, a perfect visual metaphor for the turmoil brewing inside him. He was a man haunted by the ghosts of unfinished films, and this, his latest project, a psychological thriller set against the stark beauty of Iceland, felt more like an exorcism than a movie.  He was three weeks behind schedule, a million kroner over budget, and his lead actress had just threatened to walk unless he got rid of the Icelandic horses she swore were giving her the evil eye.  This, Elias thought with a grim chuckle, was going to be either a masterpiece or a magnificent disaster.
