The biting November wind whistled down Bleecker Street, tugging at the faded awning of "Scissorhands & Whispers," a tiny barbershop nestled between a falafel joint and a vintage clothing store overflowing with moth-eaten fur coats.  Inside, the air hummed with the low thrum of a vintage radio playing Billie Holiday and the warm, yeasty scent of rising dough from next door. Anastasia "Stasia" Petrova, her fingers nimble despite the chill, meticulously snipped away at Mr. Henderson's thinning grey hair, the rhythmic click of her shears a counterpoint to Lady Day's melancholic croon.  Sunlight streamed through the dusty front window, illuminating the swirling motes of hair and the myriad of antique barbering tools adorning the walls. It was a Tuesday, typically slow, but Stasia had a feeling this particular day held something more than the usual trim and shave.
