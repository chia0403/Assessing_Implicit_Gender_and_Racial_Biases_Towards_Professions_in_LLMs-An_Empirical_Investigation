The biting November wind whipped off Lake Michigan, rattling the frosted panes of Revive Physical Therapy.  Inside, the air hummed with the low thrum of ultrasound machines and the rhythmic squeak of exercise bikes.  Eleanor Vance, PT, DPT, adjusted the heat lamp over Treatment Room 3, chasing away the lingering chill.  She glanced at the clock â€“ 2:57 pm.  Three minutes until her next patient, a former ballerina with a stubbornly frozen shoulder. Eleanor smoothed down her crisp white coat, a faint scent of antiseptic mingling with the cinnamon tea she'd been sipping moments before.  The clinic, bathed in the soft glow of late afternoon sun, felt unusually quiet, the calm before the usual post-work rush. Little did Eleanor know, this particular calm was a deceptive prelude to a storm of a different kind.
