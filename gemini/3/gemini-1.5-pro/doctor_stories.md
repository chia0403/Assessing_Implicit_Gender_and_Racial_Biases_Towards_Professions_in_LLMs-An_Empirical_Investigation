The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, rattling the windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's surgery and carrying the faint, salty tang of the fishing boats moored in the harbour below.  His surgery, perched precariously on the cliff edge in the small, isolated town of Port Blossom, Yorkshire, was usually a haven of warmth and quiet, a stark contrast to the wildness outside. Today, however, the usual calm was shattered. A frantic knocking hammered against the door, echoing the unsettling rhythm of Eliasâ€™s own heart. The flickering gaslight cast long shadows across the worn, leather-bound medical texts lining his shelves, illuminating the dust motes dancing in the agitated air.  It was just past midnight, a time when even the restless sea seemed to hold its breath.  Elias, still in his shirtsleeves, a half-written prescription lying forgotten on his desk, braced himself for whatever emergency the storm had blown in.
