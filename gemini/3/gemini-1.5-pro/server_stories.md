The flickering neon sign of the Starlight Diner cast a lurid, greasy glow across the rain-slicked asphalt of Highway 17. Inside, the air hung thick with the mingled scents of frying onions, stale coffee, and desperation.  Amelia "Amy" Rose Hawthorne, her name tag pinned slightly askew on her faded turquoise uniform, wiped down the sticky Formica countertop for the tenth time in as many minutes.  It was 11:57 pm on a Tuesday, and the Starlight, usually bustling with truckers and late-night wanderers, was eerily empty. The only sound besides the rhythmic drip of a leaky faucet was the low hum of the refrigerator struggling to keep the day-old pies cool. Amy glanced at the clock, its plastic face yellowed with age, and sighed. Another slow night. Another night spent watching the rain lash against the windows and wondering if she'd ever escape this greasy spoon purgatory.
