The biting November wind whipped around Cassandra “Cassie” Moreau, sending strands of her auburn hair dancing across her face.  She tucked them behind her ear, her gloved hand still clutching the blueprints rolled tight against her thigh. The half-finished skeleton of the Solstice Tower loomed before her, a steel and concrete behemoth scratching at the perpetually grey London sky.  Thirty stories of ambition, it was supposed to be her magnum opus, a testament to sustainable architecture and a beacon of hope in a city choking on its own history. Instead, it felt like a concrete noose tightening around her neck.  Rain began to fall, fat, icy droplets plastering her already damp coat to her back.  A crane groaned somewhere above, its metallic sigh echoing the disquiet in Cassie's heart.  The whispers had started again, the rumours circulating amongst the construction crew, the ones she desperately tried to ignore.  They said the site was cursed.  They said the tower was doomed.  And tonight, standing in the biting wind, staring up at the skeletal frame against the stormy sky, Cassie was starting to believe them.
