The biting wind whipped Amelia "Mia" Rodriguez's dark braid across her face as she trudged through the ankle-deep snow towards the primate enclosure.  The sky above the Peaks of Otter Zoo was a bruised purple, threatening another flurry.  The air, crisp and pine-scented, vibrated with the unusual silence that preceded a heavy snowfall.  Mia, bundled in a thick parka and waterproof trousers, exhaled a plume of white that momentarily obscured her view of the enclosure's mesh roof.  Inside, the usual cacophony of screeches and howls from the resident troop of Japanese macaques was replaced by an unsettling quiet.  A knot of unease tightened in Mia's stomach.  It wasn't like the macaques to be so subdued, even in the cold. They usually reveled in the snow, turning their hot spring into a swirling, frosty jacuzzi. Something was wrong.
