The flickering fluorescent lights of the Kressler & Blake law offices buzzed like trapped insects, a soundtrack to Amelia Hayes’ late-night document review. Outside, the Denver skyline glittered with a million tiny, indifferent lights, a stark contrast to the sterile beige walls surrounding her.  It was almost 10 pm on a Friday, and Amelia, a paralegal with a penchant for true crime podcasts and an aversion to inefficiency, was the only soul left in the sprawling office on the 22nd floor. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and printer toner, a familiar aroma that had become synonymous with impending deadlines.  Tonight, it was the Braxton case, a messy divorce involving a tech mogul, a suspiciously missing prenuptial agreement, and enough encrypted emails to make Amelia’s head spin. She pushed a strand of loose, dark-curled hair behind her ear and sighed, the glow of her computer screen reflecting in the lenses of her oversized glasses.  The silence, usually a welcome companion, tonight felt charged, a prelude to something Amelia couldn’t quite put her finger on.
