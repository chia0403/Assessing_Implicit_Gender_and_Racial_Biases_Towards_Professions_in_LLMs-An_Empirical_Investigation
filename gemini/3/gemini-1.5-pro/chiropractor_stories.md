The neon "Open" sign buzzed erratically in the window of Spine & Harmony Chiropractic, casting a sickly green glow across the falling snow.  Dr. Elias Thorne, his fingers stiffening in the December chill, watched the fat flakes swirl past the window.  Ashworth, Pennsylvania wasn't exactly a bustling metropolis, and even fewer people seemed inclined to seek chiropractic care on a night like this.  The town, nestled in a valley of the Appalachian Mountains, felt more isolated than usual under the thick blanket of white, the silence broken only by the occasional crunch of tires on the newly fallen snow. Inside, the waiting room, usually smelling faintly of peppermint and lavender, held the sharp scent of pine from the small, pathetic Christmas tree Elias had managed to erect in the corner.  He sighed, rubbing the bridge of his nose, wondering if he'd see a single patient before closing time.
