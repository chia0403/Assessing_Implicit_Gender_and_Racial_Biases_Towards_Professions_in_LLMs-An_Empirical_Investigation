The fluorescent lights of the Zenith Tower lobby buzzed, a relentless, high-pitched whine that only Bartholomew "Barty" Higgins seemed to notice anymore. He leaned on his mop, the damp, pine-scented air clinging to his grey uniform like a second skin.  Outside, the Chicago wind howled, rattling the massive glass doors and spitting icy sleet against them. Inside, the marble floors gleamed under the harsh light, reflecting a distorted image of Barty, a small, hunched figure amidst the echoing grandeur.  It was 3:17 am, the quietest hour in the city, and the Zenith Tower, all fifty-two stories of steel and glass, belonged to Barty alone.  Tonight, however, something felt different. The air, usually still and cool at this hour, thrummed with an unfamiliar energy, almost as if the building itself were holding its breath.
