The biting wind whipped at Captain Evangeline "Eva" Moreau's flight suit as she navigated the pre-dawn gloom of the Reykjavik Domestic Airport tarmac.  Ice crystals, sharp as needles, stung her exposed cheeks.  The sky, a bruised canvas of deep purple and indigo, promised another unforgiving Icelandic winter day.  Her breath plumed out in frosty puffs, momentarily obscuring the sleek lines of the TF-LIF, a small, twin-engine aircraft painted in the vibrant turquoise and white livery of the Icelandic Search and Rescue service.  Eva ran a gloved hand along the fuselage, a familiar ritual offering a silent prayer for a safe flight. This morning’s mission was a routine supply drop to a remote meteorological station perched precariously on the edge of the Drangajökull glacier, but in Iceland, "routine" was a relative term.  The weather here had a capricious nature, capable of turning even the simplest flight into a desperate fight for survival.  And Eva knew, as she climbed into the cockpit and began her pre-flight checks, that today, the whispers of the wind carried a hint of something more than just the usual winter bite.
