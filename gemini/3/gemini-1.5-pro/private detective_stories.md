Silas, full name Silas Thatcher Finch III, but never called anything other than Silas, stared out at the rain-slicked streets of New Birmingham. Neon signs flickered through the downpour, casting an oily, iridescent sheen on the puddles that gathered at the base of the rusting fire escapes crisscrossing the brick buildings.  The city, a sprawling metropolis built on the ruins of old Birmingham, was a labyrinth of narrow alleys, towering skyscrapers, and forgotten subway tunnels – a perfect place for secrets to fester and disappear. Tonight, the city seemed to hold its breath, waiting for something – or someone – to break the tension.

The phone, perched precariously on the edge of his cluttered desk, chose that exact moment to jangle, its insistent ringing slicing through the rhythmic drumming of the rain.
