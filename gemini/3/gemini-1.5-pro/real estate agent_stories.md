The crisp October air, scented with woodsmoke and decaying leaves, whipped Amelia “Amy” Hawthorne’s auburn hair across her face as she wrestled a “For Sale” sign into the unforgiving Vermont soil.  Frost already dusted the pumpkin patch across the dirt road, and the setting sun painted the surrounding Green Mountains in hues of fiery orange and deep violet. This picturesque scene, however, did little to soothe Amy’s growing frustration.  Nestled deep in the valley outside the quaint town of Maplewood, this ramshackle farmhouse represented her last chance to land a significant sale before the winter freeze put the local real estate market into hibernation.  The property, christened “Whispering Pines” by some optimistically-minded previous owner, was more aptly described as “Drafty Shack with Suspicious Staining.”  Still, Amy had plastered on her brightest smile, penned an alluring description highlighting its "rustic charm" and "development potential," and prayed for a miracle.  She needed this sale.  Not just for the commission, but for the validation.  After three years struggling to break into Maplewood’s tight-knit real estate scene, Amy was starting to wonder if she'd ever be more than the town’s real estate equivalent of a perpetually benched player.
