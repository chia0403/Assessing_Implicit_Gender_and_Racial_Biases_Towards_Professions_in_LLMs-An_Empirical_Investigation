The biting wind whipped across the vast, flat expanse of the Mojave Desert, stinging Elias Vanceâ€™s cheeks even through his thick beard. Dawn was just beginning to bleed color into the inky sky, painting the jagged peaks of the distant mountains with hues of rose and burnt orange.  He stood beside his orange and white striped Ford F-150, parked precariously close to the shoulder of Interstate 15, the rumble of the occasional semi-truck a low thrum beneath the howling wind.  Elias, bundled in a fluorescent yellow parka and worn leather work boots, surveyed the scene: a tumbleweed the size of a small car lodged against a chain-link fence, effectively blocking the drainage culvert.  Above him, the sodium lights of the highway buzzed and flickered, casting long, distorted shadows that danced and shifted with the gusts. This was just another Tuesday for Elias, a highway maintenance worker for Caltrans District 8, and another testament to the unpredictable nature of his job.
