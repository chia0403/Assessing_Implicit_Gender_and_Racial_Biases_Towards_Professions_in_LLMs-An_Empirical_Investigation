The tar hissed and bubbled under the August sun, the smell thick and acrid in Elias Thorne's nostrils.  He wiped a bead of sweat from his brow with the back of his calloused hand, leaving a streak of black across his forehead. Cincinnati shimmered below, a hazy mosaic of brick and concrete baking under the relentless Ohio heat.  From his vantage point atop the four-story Victorian, Elias could see the lazy bend of the Ohio River glinting like molten pewter. The slate tiles, slick with the melted tar, felt precarious under his worn work boots, but he moved with the easy grace of long practice.  This was Eliasâ€™s city, seen from angles most people never experienced, a jigsaw puzzle of rooftops and chimneys, fire escapes and water towers. Today, his canvas was the steeply pitched roof of the old Weatherby mansion, a magnificent but decaying testament to a bygone era.  A sudden gust of wind ripped across the roof, tugging at the drop cloth Elias had secured earlier.  He braced himself, his hand instinctively reaching for the ridge line, a knot of unease tightening in his stomach. This wasn't just the wind; something else was happening.
