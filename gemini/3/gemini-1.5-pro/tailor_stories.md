The biting November wind whipped through the cobbled alleyways of Aethelburg, tugging at the brightly coloured fabrics hanging outside Elias Finch's shop.  "Finch's Fine Fabrics and Fittings," the sign proclaimed in faded gold lettering, a testament to a bygone era of prosperity.  The shop itself, nestled between a butcher and a baker, was small and cluttered, overflowing with bolts of silk, velvet, and wool in every imaginable hue.  Elias Finch, a man of precise movements and a perpetually furrowed brow, stood hunched over his workbench, the warm glow of a gas lamp illuminating the intricate needlework in his hands.  He was meticulously repairing a tear in the emerald green cloak of Lady Beatrice Worthington, a notoriously demanding client whose sharp tongue was almost as legendary as her extensive wardrobe. Outside, the first flakes of snow began to fall, hinting at the long, cold winter ahead, and Elias sighed, a puff of breath momentarily obscuring the steady flicker of the lamp.  He had a feeling this winter wouldn't just be cold, it would beâ€¦ different.
