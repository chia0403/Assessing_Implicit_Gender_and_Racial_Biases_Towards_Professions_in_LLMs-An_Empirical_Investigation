Rain lashed against the leaded windows of Judge Amelia Iris Thorne's chambers, mimicking the tempest brewing inside her.  The ornate clock on the mantelpiece chimed six times, a mournful counterpoint to the crackling fire in the hearth.  Her chambers, usually a sanctuary of mahogany and leather-bound volumes, felt oppressive tonight.  The air hung thick with the scent of woodsmoke and the unspoken tension of the case she'd just adjourned.  Outside, the gaslights of Old City Philadelphia flickered and danced in the wind, casting long, wavering shadows across Independence Square.  The year was 1888, and the cobbled streets, slick with rain, whispered secrets of a city on the cusp of change, a city grappling with its own shadows, much like Judge Thorne herself.
