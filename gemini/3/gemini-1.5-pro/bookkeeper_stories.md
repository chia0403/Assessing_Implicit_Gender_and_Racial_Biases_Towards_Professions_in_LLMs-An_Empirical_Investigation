Rain lashed against the mullioned windows of Elias Finch’s office, a frantic tattoo against the otherwise hushed quiet of the Grimshaw Building.  Elias, his spectacles perched precariously on his nose, meticulously entered figures into the thick leather-bound ledger, the nib of his fountain pen scratching a rhythmic counterpoint to the storm outside.

The year was 1888, and the gas lamps that flickered in the street below cast long, dancing shadows that seemed to mimic the anxieties swirling within Elias’s own mind. The accounts of Grimshaw & Sons, purveyors of fine clocks and automata, were, to put it mildly, a disaster.
