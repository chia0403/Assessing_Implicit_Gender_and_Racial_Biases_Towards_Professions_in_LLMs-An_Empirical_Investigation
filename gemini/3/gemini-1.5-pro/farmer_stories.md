The biting wind whipped across the frost-kissed fields of Hemlock Hollow, stinging Elias Thorne's cheeks raw.  Sunrise painted the eastern sky in bruised hues of purple and orange, but its warmth hadn't yet reached the valley floor.  Elias, bundled in a thick wool coat and a knitted cap pulled low over his ears, surveyed his land.  Fifty acres of rolling hills and fertile bottomland, bordered by a whispering stand of pines and bisected by the gurgling Hemlock Creek. This was his kingdom, inherited from generations of Thornes who had tilled this same soil.  The crisp air smelled of woodsmoke and the promise of snow, and though the first hard freeze had already kissed the late-season pumpkins, Elias felt a familiar pang of contentment.  This was his life, hard and unforgiving at times, but ultimately rewarding in its simple rhythm. But this morning, something felt different. A subtle unease tugged at the edges of his peace, like a crow's unsettling caw echoing in the stillness before dawn.
