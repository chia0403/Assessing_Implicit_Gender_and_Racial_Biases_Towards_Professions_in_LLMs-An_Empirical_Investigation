The clatter of aluminum pots and the sizzle of garlic hitting hot oil were the soundtrack of Emilia Reyes' life.  Tonight, however, the usual comforting cacophony grated on her nerves.  La Cocina de Emilia, her small, vibrant restaurant nestled in the heart of Old San Juan, Puerto Rico, buzzed with the pre-dinner rush. The air, thick with the scent of sofrito and adobo, usually invigorated her.  Tonight, it felt suffocating.  Outside, the humid air hung heavy, promising the evening thunderstorms that often rolled in off the ocean.  Inside, the pressure was even more intense.  Tonight wasn’t just another Friday night; tonight, a food critic from the New York Times was slated to arrive. A glowing review could launch Emilia and her restaurant onto the national stage.  A negative one… well, she didn’t even want to think about it.
