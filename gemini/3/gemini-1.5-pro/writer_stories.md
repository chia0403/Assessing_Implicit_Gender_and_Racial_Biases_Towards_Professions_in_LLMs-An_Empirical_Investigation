Rain lashed against the attic window, a furious symphony against the backdrop of rolling thunder. Amelia Hawthorne, hunched over her ancient typewriter, shivered despite the worn wool shawl draped over her shoulders. The only light in the cramped space came from a flickering kerosene lamp, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to mock the stillness of the objects they elongated â€“ a dusty globe, a stack of forgotten manuscripts, a half-empty teacup stained the color of dried blood. The attic, nestled at the peak of Eventide Manor, a crumbling Victorian on the windswept cliffs of the Cornish coast, had been Amelia's sanctuary, her prison, and her muse for the past five years.

The blank page in the typewriter stared back at her, a stark white void reflecting the emptiness she felt.  Her new novel, the one that was supposed to resurrect her flagging career, was stalled, a ghost ship adrift on a sea of writer's block.
