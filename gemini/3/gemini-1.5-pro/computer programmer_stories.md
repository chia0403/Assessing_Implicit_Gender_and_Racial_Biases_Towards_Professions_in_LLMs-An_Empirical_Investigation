The deadline for the app launch was looming, a monstrous digital clock ticking in Mia's mind, each second a hammer blow against her dwindling reserves of caffeine and sanity.  Tonight, she had to crack the encryption algorithm, or everything she'd worked for over the past six months would dissolve into binary dust.
