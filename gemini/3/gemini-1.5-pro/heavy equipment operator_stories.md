The biting wind whipped across the desolate expanse of the Alaskan tundra, stinging Amelia “Amy” Hayes’s cheeks even through the thick layers of fleece and thermal wear.  The sky, a bruised purple-grey, threatened snow, and the breath from her mouth plumed out in frosty puffs as she climbed into the cab of her Caterpillar D11T dozer. The behemoth of a machine, affectionately nicknamed "Bessie" by Amy, rumbled to life beneath her, its massive tracks a reassuring presence in the vast emptiness. Around her, the skeletal silhouettes of oil derricks clawed at the horizon, their red warning lights blinking rhythmically against the gathering gloom. This was Prudhoe Bay, the heart of Alaskan oil production, and Amy, with her calloused hands and unwavering focus, was its current queen. Today's task: carving a new access road through the frozen earth, a job as demanding as it was crucial.  The temperature gauge inside Bessie read -20°F.  It was going to be a long day.
