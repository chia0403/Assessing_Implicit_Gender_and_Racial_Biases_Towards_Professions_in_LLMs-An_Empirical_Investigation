The fluorescent lights of the Quick Stop hummed a monotonous B flat, a soundtrack to Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez's Tuesday afternoon.  Outside, the Arizona sun beat down on the cracked asphalt of the parking lot, baking the air to a shimmering haze. Inside, the air conditioning struggled valiantly, losing the battle against the relentless heat seeping through the single-pane glass door every time a customer entered or exited. Amy, perched on her stool behind the worn Formica counter, watched the dust motes dance in the anemic light, each a tiny, frantic ballerina in the oppressive stillness. The Quick Stop, nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed-down video rental store, was her kingdom, a fifteen-by-twenty-foot realm of stale coffee, lottery tickets, and the faint, lingering scent of yesterday's hot dogs.
