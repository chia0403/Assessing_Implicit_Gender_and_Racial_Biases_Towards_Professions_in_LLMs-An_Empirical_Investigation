The frosted breath of November clawed at the leaded panes of the Abernathy Library, sketching ephemeral ferns and spirals across the glass. Inside, amidst the hushed rustle of turning pages and the faint scent of aging paper, Eleanor Vance, the head librarian, adjusted the oversized spectacles perched on her nose. Abernathy, nestled in the heart of the Vermont countryside, was a town steeped in quiet tradition, a place where the changing seasons were marked not by dates on a calendar but by the shifting hues of the maple trees lining Main Street.  The library, a sturdy, two-story brick building with a weather vane shaped like an open book, stood as a silent sentinel against the encroaching darkness, a beacon of knowledge and refuge in a world that seemed to grow increasingly chaotic. Eleanor, with her neat grey bun and sensible cardigan, was as much a fixture of the library as the worn oak shelves and the grandfather clock that ticked with measured solemnity in the corner. This evening, however, a disquieting stillness hung in the air, a silence deeper than the usual hushed reverence, and Eleanor couldn't shake the feeling that something was out of place.
