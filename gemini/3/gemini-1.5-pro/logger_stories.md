The biting November wind howled down from Mount Katahdin, whipping snow into Silas Thatcher's beard and freezing the sweat that clung to his flannel shirt.  The sky, a bruised purple-grey, promised more of the same. Silas, his calloused hands already numb despite the thick gloves, adjusted the steel spurs strapped to his leather boots.  He stood at the edge of the Whispering Pines logging tract, a vast expanse of ancient spruce and fir that stretched as far as the eye could see, blanketed in a thick layer of freshly fallen snow. The air, crisp and pine-scented, was broken only by the mournful creak of the trees and the distant rumble of the frozen Penobscot River.  This was Silas's world, a world of hard work, biting cold, and the silent majesty of the Maine wilderness.  Today, however,  a disquiet hung in the air, a feeling Silas couldn't quite place, something beyond the usual loneliness of his solitary work.
