The siren's wail clawed through the thick, humid New Orleans night, a banshee's cry echoing off the wrought-iron balconies and crumbling brick facades of the French Quarter. Rain, thick and relentless, hammered against the windshield of Medic One, blurring the already hazy glow of gas lamps and neon bar signs.  Inside, Amelia “Amy” LaRue, her dark hair plastered to her forehead, tightened her grip on the steering wheel, navigating the slick cobblestones.  The dispatcher's voice crackled through the radio, painting a grim picture: a possible stabbing at the corner of Bourbon and Dumaine, victim unresponsive.  Amy slammed the ambulance into park, throwing open the door and stepping out into the deluge, the scent of stale beer, rain-soaked beignets, and something metallic hanging heavy in the air.  The vibrant, chaotic tapestry of the French Quarter had become a backdrop for a tragedy about to unfold, and Amy, as always, was on the front lines.
