The biting wind, scented with sawdust and woodsmoke, whipped around Elias Thorne's thick wool coat as he unlocked the back door of Thorne & Sons Quality Meats.  The pre-dawn sky above the small town of Hemlock Hollow, Pennsylvania, was a bruise-coloured purple, promising snow.  Elias, his breath clouding in the frigid air, hauled in a quarter of venison, its frozen hide gleaming under the single bare bulb illuminating the alley. The butcher shop, a squat brick building nestled between a perpetually closed antique store and a surprisingly bustling bakery, had been in his family for three generations.  Inside, the faint scent of sawdust lingered amongst the deeper, richer aroma of aging beef and the metallic tang of freshly sharpened knives.  Elias, his face weathered and lined like a well-worn cutting board, set the venison on the steel table, the clang echoing in the stillness. He knew, with a certainty that settled deep in his bones, that this day would be different.
