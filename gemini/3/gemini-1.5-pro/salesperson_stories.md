The biting wind whipped at Amelia “Amy” Hawthorne’s trench coat as she navigated the cobblestone streets of Old Montreal.  Flakes of snow, fat and lazy, began to drift down, clinging to the wrought iron balconies and the centuries-old stone facades.  Amy pulled her scarf tighter, the wool scratching against her cheek.

Amy, a pharmaceutical sales representative for Novus Medica, clutched her briefcase tighter, its worn leather a testament to her relentless pursuit of quotas.  Her next appointment, with the notoriously difficult Dr. Jean-Pierre Dubois, loomed large in her mind.

Amy exhaled a plume of frosty air, a mixture of anticipation and trepidation swirling within her. This sale was crucial, not just for her bonus, but for her career.  She adjusted her briefcase and pushed open the heavy oak door of the clinic, the small brass bell above it jingling a nervous welcome.
