The  closest town, Dust Devil Creek, was a bone-jarring thirty miles away, a speck of civilization swallowed by the vast, indifferent landscape.  This evening, the silence, usually a comforting companion to Jed, felt heavy, pregnant with a disquiet that settled deep in his gut, colder than the wind biting at his cheeks.
