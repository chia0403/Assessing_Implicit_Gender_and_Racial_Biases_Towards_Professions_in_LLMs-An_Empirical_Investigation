The fluorescent lights of Northwood High hummed a monotonous B-flat, a soundtrack to Ms. Eleanor Vance’s Tuesday morning.  Her office, a converted storage closet tucked between the gymnasium and the cafeteria, smelled faintly of stale coffee and teenage angst.  Rain lashed against the small, barred window, mirroring the storm brewing in Eleanor's chest.  Another student, a junior named Kevin, had been suspended for fighting, the third this month. It wasn’t even 8:30 a.m., and Eleanor already felt the weight of Northwood’s problems pressing down on her, each one a tiny crack in the foundation of this crumbling public school nestled in the forgotten corner of Alder’s Bend, Oregon.
