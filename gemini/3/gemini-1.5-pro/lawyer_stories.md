The rain hammered against the arched windows of Amelia Grace Hawthorne's office, each drop a staccato note in the symphony of misery playing out in the heart of downtown Philadelphia.  Gargoyles perched on the neo-Gothic facade of the Girard Building seemed to leer down at the sodden streets, mirroring the grim expression etched on Amelia's face.  Her office, perched high on the fifteenth floor, usually offered a breathtaking view of the city, but tonight the swirling grey mist obscured everything beyond the windowpane, reflecting only the sterile glow of her desk lamp back at her.  Legal pads strewn with hastily scribbled notes, half-empty coffee cups, and a wilting peace lily formed a still life of professional exhaustion. The clock on the ornate mantelpiece chimed eleven times, each chime a hammer blow against the fragile remnants of Amelia's hope.  She had a trial starting in the morning, a case she couldnâ€™t afford to lose, and the key witness had just vanished.
