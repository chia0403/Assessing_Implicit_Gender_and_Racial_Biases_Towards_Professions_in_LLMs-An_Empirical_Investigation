The flickering gaslight painted Aurelia Nightingale’s dressing room in a sepia tone, catching the dust motes swirling around her chipped porcelain sink.  Outside, the November wind howled down the narrow alleyways of Prague, rattling the single, grimy windowpane.  1923 clung to the city like the clinging damp, a post-war malaise settling over the cobbled streets and into the very bones of the once-grand buildings. The once-opulent  Divadlo Blaník, where Aurelia was about to perform, had seen better days. Its plush velvet seats were threadbare, the gold leaf peeling from the ornate carvings, and the air hung heavy with the scent of stale beer and desperation.  Tonight, however,  Aurelia hoped her voice, a husky contralto with a range that could shatter glass or soothe a savage beast, would bring a flicker of warmth and light to this forgotten corner of the city.  Tonight, she would sing for her life.
