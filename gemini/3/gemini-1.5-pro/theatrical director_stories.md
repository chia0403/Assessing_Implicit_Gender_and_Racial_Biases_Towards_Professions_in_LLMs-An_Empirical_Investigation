The velvet curtains of the Rialto Theatre, once a majestic crimson, were now faded to the dusty hue of dried blood.  Dust motes, disturbed by the weak October breeze filtering through a cracked pane, danced in the single shaft of sunlight that pierced the gloom.  Here, amidst the ghosts of forgotten performances and the scent of mothballs and stale popcorn, sat Elias Thorne, his elbows propped on a scarred wooden desk, a half-eaten ham sandwich curling at the edges beside him. Elias, a man whose youthful exuberance had been eroded by years of battling dwindling audiences and temperamental actors, stared out at the empty seats. The Rialto, his Rialto, was dying, and he, its stubborn, heartbroken caretaker, was going down with the ship.  Outside, the biting wind whistled down Main Street in the sleepy town of Harmony Creek, a mournful symphony accompanying the theatre's final act.
