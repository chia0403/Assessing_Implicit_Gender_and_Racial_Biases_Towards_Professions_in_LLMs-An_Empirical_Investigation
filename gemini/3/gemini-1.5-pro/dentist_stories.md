The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne as he locked up his practice, Thorne Dental, tucked between a laundromat and a perpetually empty storefront on Elm Street.  The neon "Open" sign flickered and buzzed, stubbornly refusing to switch off, casting a sickly green glow onto the already slick sidewalk.  Oakhaven, Illinois, population 3,248, wasn't exactly known for its vibrant nightlife, and at 7:30 pm on a Tuesday, the town square was deserted except for a stray dog rummaging through an overflowing trash can.  Elias shivered, pulling his worn wool coat tighter around him. He'd been looking forward to a quiet evening with a reheated lasagna and a good book, but a strange, gnawing feeling in his gut told him tonight wouldn't be so uneventful.
