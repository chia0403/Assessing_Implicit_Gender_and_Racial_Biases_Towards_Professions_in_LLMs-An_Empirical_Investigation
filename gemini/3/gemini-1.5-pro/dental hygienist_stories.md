The biting wind whipped off Lake Champlain, stinging Amelia Hayes's cheeks as she hurried across the cobblestone street. Tiny, iridescent pellets of sleet pinged against her wool coat, sounding eerily like the high-pitched whine of her dentist's drill.

The waiting room, usually bustling with patients, was eerily deserted. Only the receptionist, Mrs. Perreault, a woman whose smile lines seemed permanently etched onto her face, sat behind the polished mahogany desk, knitting a vibrant crimson scarf.
