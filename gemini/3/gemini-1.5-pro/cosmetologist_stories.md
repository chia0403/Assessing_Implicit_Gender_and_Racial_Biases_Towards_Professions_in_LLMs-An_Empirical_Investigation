The flickering neon sign of "Shear Radiance" cast a lavender glow on the rain-slicked streets of Harmony Bay. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of hairspray, coconut oil, and anticipation. Rain lashed against the large front window, blurring the reflection of Eliza Jane Cartwright, meticulously applying a vibrant teal dye to a client's choppy pixie cut.  Harmony Bay, a small coastal town in Oregon, usually thrived on sunshine and ocean breezes, but tonight, the storm mirrored the tempest brewing within Eliza Jane. This wasn't just any Thursday night; it was the eve of the annual Harmony Bay Mermaid Festival, an event that, for Eliza Jane, held more significance than just glitter and fishtails.
