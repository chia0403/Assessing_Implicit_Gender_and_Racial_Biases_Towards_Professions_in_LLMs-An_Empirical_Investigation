The fluorescent hum of the dental clinic, a relentless, almost musical counterpoint to the rhythmic *thump-thump* of Amelia Hayes's heart, vibrated through the linoleum floor.  Sunlight, fractured and distorted by the strategically placed dental lamps, cast elongated shadows across the pristine white walls of Dr. Chen's office.  Amelia, a dental hygienist with a name whispered with respect and a touch of hushed reverence among the patients at "Smiles for Success," meticulously polished a particularly stubborn tartar deposit on a molar, her gloved hand a blur of practiced precision.  Her name, etched onto a small, almost unnoticeable plaque on the wall next to the waiting area, felt as ordinary as the stainless steel instruments she wielded.  But beneath the surface of the sterile, slightly antiseptic atmosphere, Amelia felt a simmering unease, a prickle of anticipation that, unlike the usual buzz of a busy Wednesday afternoon, refused to be ignored.  Outside, the muted sounds of the city – the distant rumble of buses, the occasional honk of a car – seemed to echo the quiet thrumming anxiety inside her.
