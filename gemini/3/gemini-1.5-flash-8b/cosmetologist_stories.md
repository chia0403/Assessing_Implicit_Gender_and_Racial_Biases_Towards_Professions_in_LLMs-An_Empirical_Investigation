The humid air hung heavy in the salon, thick with the scent of jasmine and something faintly metallic, likely the remnants of a particularly dramatic hair dye.  Sunlight, fractured and dappled through the stained-glass window depicting a mythical siren, illuminated dust motes dancing in the air.  Amelia Seraphina Blackwood, a cosmetologist with eyes the colour of polished amethyst and a smile that could melt glaciers, surveyed the scene.  Her salon, "Seraphina's Shear Magic," nestled within a Victorian townhouse on a quiet cobbled street, was a sanctuary of sculpted curls and whispered secrets.  Today, however, the usual tranquility was punctuated by a strange stillness, a silence that hung heavier than the humid air itself.  A single, crimson-haired client sat perched on the plush velvet chair, her face buried in her hands, as if wrestling with a tempest within.  Amelia approached, her movements as graceful as a dancer's, her heart already anticipating the unspoken storm brewing.
