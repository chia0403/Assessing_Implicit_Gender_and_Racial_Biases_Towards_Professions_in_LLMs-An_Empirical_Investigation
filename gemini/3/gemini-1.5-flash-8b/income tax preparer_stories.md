The fluorescent lights of the "Tax Time Express" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Hawthorne's meticulously organized life.  Paperclips, neatly stacked, glinted under the harsh glare.  Filing cabinets, labelled with painstaking precision, whispered tales of countless tax returns, each a tiny puzzle demanding her focus.  Amelia, a woman whose sensible, charcoal-grey cardigan seemed to absorb the chaos around her, expertly navigated the maze of forms and figures.  Her desk, a small island of order in a sea of client anxieties, was littered with the usual paraphernalia – tax codes, spreadsheets, and a perpetually full mug of lukewarm coffee.  Today, however, a particular aroma hung in the air – cinnamon rolls. It was Tuesday, and the aroma usually signified the arrival of a client with a particularly complex (and potentially lucrative) case.

The Tax Time Express wasn't a fancy office.  Located in a nondescript strip mall on the outskirts of the city, it felt more like a well-maintained, slightly depressing garage. The air, thick with the smell of stale coffee and the ever-present faint scent of old paper, was a testament to its dedicated clientele.  Sunlight, weak and filtered through dusty windows, cast elongated shadows across the room.  Outside, the bustling city life continued its relentless rhythm.  Amelia, however, was firmly entrenched in her own world, the world of numbers, deductions, and the relentless pursuit of the correct tax bracket.  Today, a new client, Mr. Jasper Finch, a renowned architect known for his unconventional designs and even more unconventional tax strategies, was due to arrive.  She prepared her quill and pad, her brow furrowing in anticipation.
