Rain hammered against the grimy windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, a relentless drumming that mirrored the anxieties swirling inside her.  The flickering fluorescent lights cast long, distorted shadows across the cluttered desk, highlighting the half-eaten bowl of cereal, the overflowing recycling bin, and the stack of clinical files that seemed to grow taller with each passing day.  Eleanor, a clinical psychologist specializing in trauma recovery, sat hunched over a patient chart, the worn leather of her chair protesting softly beneath her.  Her tweed jacket, usually a comforting anchor, felt heavy and damp against her skin.  This was her Wednesday night ritual, a late-night catch-up session with the ghosts of her patients' pasts, a task that demanded quiet concentration, even if it left her feeling more drained than comforted.  Outside, the city, a labyrinth of steel and glass, seemed to hold its breath, awaiting the storm's release.


The setting was a small, unassuming office building on the outskirts of a bustling metropolis.  The city's relentless energy was a stark contrast to the quiet, almost desolate, atmosphere of the street outside her office.  The building itself was a testament to time; its paint peeled in places, its windows clouded with grime, yet it held an enduring strength, like an old oak weathering a storm.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and exhaust fumes, a familiar blend that had become almost comforting to Eleanor.
