The flickering fluorescent lights of "Nails of the Night" cast a sickly yellow glow over Amelia Nightingale's workspace.  Dust motes danced in the air, illuminated by the harsh beams, painting miniature constellations on the chipped Formica counter.  A faint, cloying scent of artificial vanilla hung heavy in the air, mingled with the subtle, sweet perfume of the latest nail polish Amelia was prepping â€“ a shade she'd christened "Twilight's Embrace."  Her own nails, perfectly manicured in a sophisticated crimson, contrasted sharply with the chaotic swirl of cotton swabs, nail clippers, and polish bottles that cluttered the small, cramped salon.  Amelia, a manicurist with eyes that held a depth beyond her profession, meticulously applied a thin layer of base coat to a client's long, elegant fingernail.  Outside, the city hummed with a cacophony of sirens and distant car horns, a soundtrack to the hushed whispers and soft sighs that filled the salon, each echoing in the quiet space like trapped birds.
