Professor Alistair Finch-Hancock adjusted his spectacles, the lenses reflecting the harsh, fluorescent glow of the archaeology lab. Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom, illuminating a chipped terracotta fragment nestled within a pile of meticulously cataloged artifacts.  The air, thick with the scent of aged paper and decaying wood, was almost tangible, humming with the unspoken stories whispered by the relics surrounding him.  This was the hallowed ground of the Department of Ancient Mesopotamian Studies at the University of Oxford, a place Alistair had called home for the last twenty-five years.  He traced the delicate carvings on the fragment, a tiny inscription barely visible, a potential key to unlocking a forgotten chapter in the history of the Akkadian Empire.  But today, the fragment felt strangely...weighty.  A disquieting unease, a feeling of being watched, clung to the air, intensified by the sudden, inexplicable silence in the normally bustling lab.
