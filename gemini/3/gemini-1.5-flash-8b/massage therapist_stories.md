The chipped porcelain sink of "Serenity Spa" reflected the fluorescent hum of the late afternoon.  Dust motes danced in the weak light, illuminated by the faint lavender scent of chamomile that hung heavy in the air.  Rain hammered against the corrugated metal awning, a relentless percussion that mirrored the pounding headache throbbing in Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's temples.  Amy, a massage therapist with a practiced calm that rarely faltered, felt the familiar knot tightening in her own neck.  She traced the outline of a faded floral pattern on the faded beige wallpaper.  It was almost 7 pm, and the last two clients had been particularly demanding.  A gruff, sweaty businessman who claimed his back was "worse than a broken drum," and a frantic young woman whose anxiety manifested as a series of strained sighs and tense shoulders.  Amy's small, cluttered office, the heart of Serenity Spa, felt less like a haven and more like a battlefield.
