Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the "Healing Hands" community centre, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Amelia Nightingale, occupational therapist.  The air hung thick with the smell of damp earth and disinfectant, a familiar, if slightly oppressive, aroma of her workplace.  Healing Hands, nestled in the heart of the sprawling, grey industrial estate of Ashwood, was a haven of faded paint and worn carpet, a place where the echoes of laughter and the quiet clinking of tools mingled with the constant low thrum of the nearby factory machinery.  Amelia, a woman with a perpetually tired but determined expression etched onto her face, stared out the grimy window, watching the rain-streaked cityscape blur into a monochrome tapestry.  Today, the usual rhythm of the centre – the rhythmic hum of a group activity, the measured click of a jigsaw puzzle, the soft rustle of pages in a book group – had been fractured.  A new patient had arrived, and Amelia felt a knot tightening in her stomach, a knot that had nothing to do with the damp.
