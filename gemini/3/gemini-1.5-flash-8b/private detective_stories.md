Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the "Lucky Strike" Detective Agency, a cramped storefront nestled between a pawn shop and a bodega on the gritty corner of Elm and Willow.  The flickering neon sign, barely holding on, cast an eerie, sickly yellow glow on Amelia "Ace"  Montgomery, her brow furrowed in concentration.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale cigarettes and desperation.  Ace, a private investigator with eyes the colour of storm clouds and a trench coat perpetually stained with something indefinable, traced a finger along a chipped mug, the remnants of lukewarm coffee clinging to its surface. The city outside, usually a symphony of sirens and honking taxis, was muted, almost ethereal, under the downpour.


This was the heart of the city's underbelly, a place where whispers turned to shouts, and shadows held secrets.  The shadows, tonight, seemed especially thick around the case that had drawn her to this precinct.


The case: The disappearance of  Cornelius "Cork" Oâ€™Malley, renowned art collector and owner of the notoriously eccentric "O'Malley's Curiosities" shop, located just a few blocks away.
