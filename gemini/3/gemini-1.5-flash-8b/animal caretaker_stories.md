The biting wind whipped Amelia Hawthorne's duster around her legs, stinging her cheeks.  She shivered, not just from the cold but from a knot of anxiety tightening in her stomach.  The sprawling, snow-covered grounds of Blackwood Manor loomed before her, a skeletal silhouette against the bruised twilight sky.  Each ancient oak, each twisted branch, seemed to whisper secrets she wasn't sure she was ready to hear.  She adjusted the heavy leather straps of her satchel, its contents—medicinal herbs, a chipped porcelain bowl, and a half-eaten apple – a meager comfort in this desolate landscape.

Amelia Hawthorne, animal caretaker for Blackwood Manor's extensive menagerie, had been summoned.  Not by the usual frantic call from her assistant, Pip, or the gentle nudging of a curious goat. This was different.  A hush fell over the manor, thicker than the frosted air, an unnatural silence punctuated only by the mournful howl of a lone wolf echoing from the far woods.

The manor itself was a gothic masterpiece, its imposing stone facade cracked and weathered, mirroring the cracks that had begun to appear in Amelia’s own composure.  Towering turrets, each bearing the faded crest of the Blackwood family, pierced the bruised twilight sky.  A skeletal vine-covered rosebush clawed at the stonework, its thorns mirrored by the icy tendrils of fear that snaked through Amelia's mind.  Within the heavy oak gates, the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves clung to the air, a palpable sense of foreboding.  The only light came from the flickering gas lamps illuminating the long, winding drive, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to mock her.  Amelia knew this was more than just a routine visit; it was a summons to the very heart of Blackwood Manor's unsettling past.  And the animals, she feared, were about to reveal its secrets.
