The biting wind, a relentless claw of prairie winter, whipped at Elias Thorne's weathered face.  Snow, the colour of a bruised plum, clung to the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks that guarded the northern edge of his farm, “Oakhaven.”  The farm, a sprawling expanse of frosted fields and wind-battered barns, felt more like a monument to hardship than a source of sustenance.  Elias, a man sculpted by the unforgiving land, knew this season was no different.  His hands, gnarled and lined with the stories of countless harvests and failed ones, clutched the worn leather reins of his horse, a chestnut mare named Star.  Star, as resilient as her master,  shivered beneath the icy blast, her breath puffing out in white clouds against the stark grey sky.  It was a bleak January day, mirroring the emptiness that had settled in Elias’s heart, a void as vast and unforgiving as the frozen plains themselves.  Elias Thorne, 48 years old, farmer of Oakhaven, stared ahead, lost in a familiar struggle against the relentless power of the Midwest winter.
