Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the "Whispering Pines" motel, a rhythmic drumming that mirrored the frantic beat of Amelia Blackwood's heart.  The air, thick with the scent of pine needles and damp earth, clung to her like a shroud.  She hunched deeper into the worn vinyl armchair, the flickering fluorescent light casting long, dancing shadows across the peeling wallpaper.  Outside, the jagged peaks of the Sawtooth Mountains loomed, a stark, unforgiving backdrop to the remote town of Copper Creek, nestled precariously in the valley below.  Amelia, a seasoned investigative journalist for the *Mountain Echo*, had come to Copper Creek to uncover the truth behind the mysterious disappearance of the local sheriff, a man known throughout the region for his incorruptible integrity. The silence was deafening, broken only by the wind whistling through the pines and the occasional, unsettling creak of the old building.  This was no simple story of a missing man. This smelled of something sinister, something buried deep within the heart of the mountains.
