The fluorescent lights of the drafting room hummed, a constant, irritating drone that seemed to vibrate through Amelia Blackwood's very bones.  Dust motes danced in the pale light, mirroring the swirling chaos in her mind.  Amelia Blackwood, a drafting worker at the sprawling, grey behemoth of Consolidated Industries, stared at the blueprint spread before her.  A complex, intricate network of pipes, valves, and machinery – a section of the new bio-reactor – stretched across the drawing board, a labyrinth of lines and symbols that defied her comprehension.  She was, frankly, utterly lost.

The room itself was a testament to industrial efficiency – sterile, cold, and devoid of any semblance of warmth.  Rows of identical drafting tables, each manned by a silent, focused figure, stretched as far as the eye could see.  The air was thick with the smell of stale coffee and the faint, metallic tang of the ink used to trace the blueprints.  A single, perpetually running Xerox machine coughed out sheets of paper with a rhythmic, almost sinister clicking.  Outside, the city roared with the relentless pulse of urban life, a stark contrast to the quiet, measured precision demanded within the confines of Consolidated Industries.  Amelia, however, felt utterly disconnected from both.  Her job, the bio-reactor, the whole vast, impersonal machine, felt like an alien language that she could never fully master.
