The biting wind whipped at Elias Thorne's thick wool coat, stinging his cheeks and rattling the tin shingles he was meticulously aligning.  Below him, the sprawling cityscape of Veridia sprawled out like a tapestry of grey and beige.  Towering skyscrapers, each a testament to Veridia's ambition, pierced the bruised sky, their polished facades reflecting the pale winter sun like fractured mirrors.  Elias, perched precariously on the narrow ridge of a fourteen-story building, felt a familiar tremor of vertigo.  He’d been a roofer for seventeen years, and the dizzying heights were as much a part of the job as the rhythmic clang of his hammer.  Today, however, the usual feeling of controlled exhilaration was tinged with a distinct unease.  He’d sensed something—something off—from the moment the insistent rattling had begun, a subtle vibration deep within the structure itself.  It wasn’t a sign of settling, not a creak of age, but something… *wrong*.
