The fluorescent hum of the lab, a constant, low thrumming, vibrated through Elara Vance's boots.  Each drop of blood, a tiny, crimson moon reflecting the sterile white walls, seemed to pulse with a life of its own.  Elara, a phlebotomist at the sprawling, modern Metropolitan Medical Center, felt a familiar tremor in her hands.  Not from nervousness, exactly, but from the sheer volume of life, both vibrant and fragile, that flowed through the veins she tapped.  Today, however, the tremor felt different.  A subtle, almost imperceptible chill, settled in the air alongside the usual antiseptic scent of disinfectant.


The lab was a hive of quiet, focused activity.  Rows of patient bays, each partitioned by frosted-glass walls, filled the room.  Rows of blinking monitors displayed the steady rhythm of heartbeats, the subtle ebb and flow of respiratory systems.  The rhythmic clicking of electronic devices punctuated the low thrumming, mirroring the predictable pulse of the patients within. The air, thick with the scent of antiseptic and the faint, metallic tang of blood, hung heavy in the sterile space.  Sunlight, filtered through the tall windows, cast long, muted shadows across the floor, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air.  Elaraâ€™s workstation sat near the back, a small island of clinical precision within the vast, sterile sea.
