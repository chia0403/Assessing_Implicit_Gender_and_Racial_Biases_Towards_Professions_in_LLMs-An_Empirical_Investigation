The biting November wind whipped Amelia Nightingale's tweed coat around her ankles as she hurried down the cobbled street towards the Spitalfields clinic.  Rain, a relentless curtain of grey, plastered the already-desolate streets to a slick, unforgiving surface.  The gaslights, flickering like anxious eyes in the gloom, cast long, dancing shadows that stretched and writhed around the ancient buildings.  Spitalfields, a district steeped in history and whispers of secrets, felt particularly foreboding tonight.  Amelia, with her usual practiced efficiency, navigated the treacherous puddles, her focus entirely on the appointment looming ahead. She was a physical therapist, specializing in sports injuries, but this client held a unique, almost unsettling air.


The clinic, a small, imposing building shrouded in ivy, housed the bustling yet quiet energy of a room full of human stories.  Within, the scent of antiseptic mingled with the comforting hum of the physiotherapy equipment. It was a place where bodies were mended, where limits were tested, and where hope, fragile and persistent, often bloomed in the quietest corners.  Amelia knew every nook and cranny of the building, every creak of the floorboards, the precise angle of the light streaming through the stained-glass window, but tonight, something felt different. A sense of unease, as sharp and cold as the November air, clung to the very atmosphere.
