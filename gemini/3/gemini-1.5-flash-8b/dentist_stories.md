The antiseptic tang of chlorhexidine clung to Dr. Eleanor Vance’s nostrils, a familiar, if slightly suffocating, scent that accompanied her every Tuesday morning.  Sunlight, fractured by the frosted glass of the "Smile Makers" dental office, sliced through the dust motes dancing in the air.  A low hum, a symphony of whirring drills and the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of a dental assistant's gloves on a metal tray, filled the small, brightly-lit waiting room.  Today, however, the usual Tuesday routine felt…different.  An unsettling quiet had settled over the practice.


The setting: a bustling, yet somewhat overlooked, corner of Oakhaven, a suburb just outside of a major city.  "Smile Makers," tucked away on a side street, wasn't known for its extravagant appointments or celebrity clientele.  It was a neighborhood dentist's office, popular with families and loyal patients who valued Dr. Vance’s gentle hands and thorough approach.  But something, something subtle and unseen, hung in the air, heavier than the usual dental instruments and the nervous chatter of waiting patients.
