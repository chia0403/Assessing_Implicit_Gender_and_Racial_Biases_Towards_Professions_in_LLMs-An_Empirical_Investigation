The biting wind whipped gravel across the cracked asphalt, stinging Elias Thorne's cheeks.  He hunched deeper into his worn, fluorescent-orange jacket, the familiar chill of a November morning in the desolate, windswept plains of the Dakotas seeping into his bones.  Dust devils danced across the vast, flat expanse, swirling the dried grass into miniature cyclones.  Scattered clusters of rusted machinery – remnants of a bygone era of boom – punctuated the otherwise monochrome landscape.  Elias was here, on this unforgiving stretch of land, to begin the arduous task of laying the foundation for a new wind farm, a testament to an energy source born from the whispers of this same wind.  The only sound besides the relentless wind was the rhythmic *thump* of his boots on the packed earth, a lonely counterpoint to the vast emptiness around him.  This was his world, his domain, and today, it was his responsibility to anchor a future.
