Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the Hopewell General Hospital, mimicking the frantic rhythm of Dr. Eleanor Vance's heart.  The flickering fluorescent lights cast long, dancing shadows across the sterile white walls of the emergency room, highlighting the frantic activity within.  The air, thick with the smell of antiseptic and fear, hung heavy as a shroud.  Hopewell, a small town nestled in the Appalachian foothills, was a place where life unfolded in dramatic, unpredictable acts, and tonight, the drama was playing out on the cold, hard tiles of the ER.  This was Eleanor's tenth year at Hopewell, and the sheer variety of traumas that had flowed through these doors was a grim testament to the region's hard-scrabble existence.  From the weekend farmers hurt by their own machinery to the seasonal hikers caught in flash floods, the emergency room was the heart of the community, a vital but often overlooked beating.
