The biting wind, a skeletal hand, clawed at the weathered stone walls of the Citadel of Whispering Towers.  Rain, the colour of lead, hammered against the battlements, each drop a tiny, echoing percussion.  Inside the fortress, the air hung thick with the scent of mildew and the faint, metallic tang of old blood.  This was the domain of Silas Blackwood, Royal Guard, and tonight, the cold held a particularly unwelcome guest: fear.

Silas Blackwood, a man hardened by years of patrolling the treacherous mountain paths and shadowed corridors of the Citadel, felt the tremor of apprehension ripple through the stone.  He stood at the foot of the winding staircase leading to the Grand Hall, his greatsword strapped across his back, its polished steel reflecting the flickering candlelight in the vaulted chamber.  A single, emerald-green light, pulsating faintly, emanated from the Hall's central archway, a beacon in the encroaching gloom.  This was no ordinary night. Whispers, hushed and urgent, had been carried on the wind for days, whispered tales of unrest, of shadow creatures stirring in the hidden valleys, and of a prophecy foretold, a prophecy promising the fall of the kingdom... and the Citadel itself.
