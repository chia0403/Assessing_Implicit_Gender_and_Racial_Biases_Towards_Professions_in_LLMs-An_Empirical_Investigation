The wind, a relentless, howling beast, whipped across the desolate plains, stinging Elias Thorne's face and rattling the worn timbers of his cabin.  Dust devils danced across the cracked earth, mimicking the frantic heartbeat thrumming in his chest.  Autumn had arrived with a fury, painting the sky in hues of bruised purple and angry orange, and with it came the creeping dread that had been haunting Elias for weeks.  His cattle, the lifeblood of his sprawling ranch, the Thorne Estate, were disappearing.  Not dying, not being stolen – simply…vanishing.


The Thorne Estate stretched for miles, a patchwork of scrubby plains and withered grass clinging precariously to the unforgiving earth.  Scattered homesteads, mere specks against the vast panorama, marked the edges of the ranch.  The closest neighbours, the gruff farmers of the Rustler's Ridge settlement, were more likely to share rumours than to offer help.  This was the heart of the Old West, a place where legends whispered on the wind and the secrets of the land were as ancient as the canyons themselves.  Each sunrise brought a new layer of dust to everything, covering not just the land but the mounting worry in Elias's eyes.
