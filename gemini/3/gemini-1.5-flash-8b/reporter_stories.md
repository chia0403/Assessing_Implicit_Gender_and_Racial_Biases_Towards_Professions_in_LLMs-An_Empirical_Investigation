The biting wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's reporter's notebook against her chest, each gust threatening to tear it from her grasp.  She hunched deeper into the skeletal frame of the abandoned lighthouse, its weathered timbers groaning in sympathy with the storm raging outside.  Salt spray stung her cheeks, blurring the already fading light of the dying sun.  The air, thick with the smell of brine and despair, hung heavy in the silent tower, the only sound the mournful cry of gulls circling the jagged cliffs below.

Setting: The desolate, windswept Outer Banks of North Carolina, a few weeks before the official start of hurricane season.  The abandoned lighthouse, a decaying monument to a forgotten era, stood sentinel atop a treacherous cliff overlooking the churning Atlantic Ocean.  The surrounding landscape was a stark tapestry of wind-whipped sand dunes, rugged coastline, and the eerie silence of nature reclaiming what man had left behind.
