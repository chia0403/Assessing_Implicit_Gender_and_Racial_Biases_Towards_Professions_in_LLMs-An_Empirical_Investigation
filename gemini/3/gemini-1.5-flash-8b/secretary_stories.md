The chipped Formica countertop gleamed under the harsh fluorescent lights of Ms. Agatha "Aggie" Finch's office.  Dust motes danced in the single beam of sunlight slicing through the grime-coated window of the crumbling Victorian building, illuminating a scattering of papers – legal documents, invoices, and a half-eaten box of stale cookies – that littered the small, cluttered space. Aggie, a secretary of meticulous habits in a world increasingly messy, sighed.  Another Tuesday.  Another mountain of paperwork.  The antique rotary phone on her desk, a relic from a bygone era, sat silent, a testament to the slowly fading relevance of her role in the grand scheme of things.

Setting:

The year is 1987.  The faded grandeur of a once-respected law firm, "Finch & Finch," clung to the decaying Victorian building on Elm Street, a relic of a bygone era.  The city, gritty and industrial, hummed with the sounds of distant traffic and the rhythmic clang of metal on metal from the factory district that bordered the city.  Inside, the firm was a microcosm of its surroundings, showing signs of past prosperity but now wrestling with the pressures of changing times and dwindling clients.  The stale air smelled of old paper, mahogany, and a faint, lingering scent of burnt coffee.
