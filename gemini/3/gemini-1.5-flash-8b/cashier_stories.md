The fluorescent lights of the "Corner Mart" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia "Amy" Carmichael's life.  The chipped Formica counter, stained with countless cups of lukewarm coffee and the ghosts of spilled milk, was her stage.  Behind it, a labyrinth of overflowing produce bins, dusty canned goods, and half-empty shelves, was her world.  Rain hammered against the corrugated metal awning, a relentless rhythm echoing the steady thrum of the self-checkout machines.  It was a Tuesday, a day like any other, and Amy, her dark hair pulled back in a tight ponytail, stared blankly at the barcode scanner.  The only excitement was the occasional elderly man who insisted on meticulously counting out his change, or the teenagers who lingered over their candy, the rustling of the wrappers a jarring counterpoint to the silent, persistent drip of the leaking faucet behind the soda display.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale bread and something vaguely floral, the peculiar aroma of the decaying potted herbs on the windowsill.
