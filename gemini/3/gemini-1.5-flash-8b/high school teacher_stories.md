The chipped porcelain sink in the staff room hummed a low, mournful tune as Eleanor Vance, meticulously arranging a bouquet of wilting sunflowers, stared out the window.  Rain hammered against the grimy panes, mimicking the relentless rhythm of the anxieties that churned within her.

A palpable, unseen weight pressed down on the school, a weight that had begun subtly in the spring, and now manifested in the unnerving silence that punctuated the usual cacophony of the staff room.  Outside, the skeletal branches of the ancient oak that lined the school grounds, a landmark for generations of Northwood students, were stark against the leaden sky.  This wasn't just rain; it felt like the world was weeping.
