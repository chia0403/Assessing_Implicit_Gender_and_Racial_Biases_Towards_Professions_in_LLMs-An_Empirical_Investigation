The chipped paint of the interrogation room, the same shade of faded teal as the perpetually smudged window, reflected the flickering fluorescent light back at Detective Isabella "Izzy" Rodriguez.  The stale smell of cheap coffee and desperation clung to the air, thick and suffocating.  Outside, the city of Veridian pulsed with a restless energy, a rhythmic thrumming of sirens and distant car horns that seemed to echo the frantic heartbeat pounding in Izzy's chest.  Rain lashed against the corrugated metal roof, a relentless percussion against the silence within the cramped space.  Veridian, a sprawling metropolis choked by industry and ambition, was a city of shadows, and this room, a microcosm of its hidden corners, held a truth buried deep beneath the layers of lies.  The suspect, a gaunt man named Silas Blackwood, stared back at her, his eyes hollow pools reflecting the cold, sterile light.  The case, the murder of a young social worker named Anya Petrova, was twisting and turning, leaving Izzy feeling more lost than ever in the labyrinthine underbelly of the city.
