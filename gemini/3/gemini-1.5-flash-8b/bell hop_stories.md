The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the polished floor of the Grand Imperial Hotel.  Dust motes, illuminated like tiny, spectral butterflies, swirled in the air, clinging to the faint scent of lavender and something indefinablyâ€¦ old money.  Augustus "Gus" Finch, bellhop extraordinaire, expertly navigated the labyrinthine corridors of the hotel, his polished shoes echoing softly against the marble floors.  It was a Tuesday night, a night of quiet expectation, the kind that usually preceded a storm.  Gus, with his perpetually attentive expression and a meticulously pressed uniform that seemed to absorb the very light in the room, was the embodiment of calm amidst the often-turbulent bustle of the hotel. Tonight, however, a peculiar stillness hung in the air, a premonition of something more than just a quiet Tuesday.
