The rhythmic clang of the excavator's bucket echoed across the desolate expanse of the Arizona desert.  Dust devils danced in the shimmering heat haze, swirling like phantoms around Amelia "Amy"  Harding's hulking machine, the "Ironheart."  Amy, her face streaked with grime and sweat, wrestled with a stubborn boulder wedged beneath the foundation of a newly constructed wind farm.  Her calloused hands gripped the levers with a familiar strength, the vibrations of the engine a constant hum in her ears.  The air, thick with the scent of creosote and sun-baked earth, hung heavy and still.  Around her, the vast, empty landscape stretched to the horizon, a canvas of burnt orange and muted grey.  Towering wind turbines, stark white against the backdrop of the endless sky, dotted the otherwise barren horizon, a testament to the relentless march of progress in this unforgiving land.  Time seemed to stand still, compressed into the repetitive cycle of digging, maneuvering, and maneuvering again.  The only sound other than the Ironheart's rhythmic churn was the distant, unwavering howl of the desert wind.
