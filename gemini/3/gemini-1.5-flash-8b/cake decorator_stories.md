The chipped porcelain sink, perpetually stained a faded robin's egg blue, reflected the flickering gaslight above Amelia “Amie” Nightingale’s tiny, cluttered kitchen.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of pale yellow light, illuminating a mountain of sugarpaste flowers, each petal meticulously sculpted.  Amie, hunched over her work surface, painstakingly piped a delicate buttercream rose onto a miniature wedding cake, the scent of vanilla and almond filling the air.  Outside, the cobbled streets of the Old Quarter of Averill echoed with the rhythmic clang of blacksmith's hammers and the distant wail of a street musician.  Amie, lost in the intricate design of the edible creation, was oblivious to the city's bustling life. She was a world unto herself, encased in the sugary symphony of her craft. Averill, a city steeped in history and steeped in the scent of roasting meats and baking bread, existed as a backdrop for her elaborate flourishes, as much a part of the cakes she made as the flowers themselves.
