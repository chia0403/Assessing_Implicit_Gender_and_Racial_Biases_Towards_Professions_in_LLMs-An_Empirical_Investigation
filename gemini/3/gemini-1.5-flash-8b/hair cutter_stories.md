The chipped Formica counter gleamed under the harsh fluorescent lights of "Scissors & Smiles," a salon that seemed to have swallowed the last vestiges of sunshine decades ago.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon light piercing the grimy window, illuminating a lone figure hunched over a client's head.  This was  Alistair Finch, a man whose own dark hair, usually meticulously sculpted into a precise, if somewhat melancholic, quiff, was now plastered to his forehead with a sheen of sweat. The scent of cheap hairspray and something vaguely metallic hung heavy in the air, a constant companion to the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of the shears.  Alistair, at twenty-eight, was a hair cutter, not by choice, but by circumstance.  He'd inherited the salon, a small, struggling business in a forgotten corner of the city, from his estranged grandfather.  His grandfather had called it a haven, a place where people could be themselves and feel beautiful; a place Alistair was struggling to believe existed anymore.
