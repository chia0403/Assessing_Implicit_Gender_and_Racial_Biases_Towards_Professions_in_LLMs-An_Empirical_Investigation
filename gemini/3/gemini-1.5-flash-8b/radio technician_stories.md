The flickering neon sign of the "Radio Shack" cast a sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked alley.  Water, pooled like stagnant mercury, reflected the garish light, distorting the already cramped space.  Inside, amidst the tangle of wires, soldering irons, and half-eaten takeout containers,  Amelia Petrova, Radio Technician extraordinaire (or at least, that's what she told herself), hunched over a battered workbench.  Her name, carefully etched onto the chipped enamel of a toolbox, seemed almost faded, swallowed by the grime.  The hum of a barely functioning generator was the only soundtrack to the silent, oppressive atmosphere.  This wasn't the glamorous world of broadcast towers and crystal-clear signals Amelia had envisioned.  This was the forgotten corner of the city, the graveyard of forgotten frequencies, the place where broken dreams and shattered radios met their end.  The city outside was a cacophony of noise; sirens wailing, car horns blaring, the distant roar of a runaway train.  But here, in this isolated, almost forgotten workshop, silence was a constant companion, a companion that threatened to swallow her whole.
