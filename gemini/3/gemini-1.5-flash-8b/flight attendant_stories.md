The fluorescent lights of the economy class cabin hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia Hayes's life.  Amelia, a flight attendant for Celestial Airlines, wasn't one for the drama, but even the most predictable transatlantic flights could deliver unexpected turbulence.  This particular flight,  number 347 to London, was a textbook example of the mundane.  Empty seats stretched out before her, a silent testament to the unpredictable nature of passenger demand, and the faint aroma of stale coffee hung heavy in the air, a familiar scent that she'd absorbed into her very being.  Outside the narrow window, the world shrunk to a swirling tapestry of clouds and blurring landmasses.

The setting:  The cramped, air-conditioned interior of a Celestial Airlines Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner, somewhere above the North Atlantic.  The year is 2024.  The rhythmic clatter of the cabin service cart, her constant companion, blended with the muffled conversations of a few scattered passengers, creating a low-key symphony of the journey.   A faint glow from the in-flight entertainment screens, a muted palette of muted colours, highlighted the passengers' faces, their expressions ranging from bored to preoccupied.  The scent of airplane peanuts and lingering coffee, and the unmistakable whisper of recycled air, was the very essence of this high-altitude journey.
