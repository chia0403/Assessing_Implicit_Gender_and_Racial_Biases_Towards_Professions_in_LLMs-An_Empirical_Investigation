The humid air hung thick and cloying, a suffocating blanket draped over the cobbled alleyway.  Dust motes danced in the sliver of sunlight filtering through the grimy archway above, illuminating a pungent, blood-red stain on the chipped flagstones.  This was the domain of Bartholomew "Barty" Blackwood, the renowned, and some whispered, *revered*, butcher of Old St. Denis.  Barty, a man carved from granite and seasoned with the scent of freshly butchered lamb, stood hunched over his worktable.  A glistening blade, honed to razor sharpness, rested in his calloused palm, reflecting the flickering gaslight that cast long, dancing shadows across the cramped shop.  His apron, stained a rich tapestry of browns and reds, was a testament to his dedication â€“ a lifetime spent wielding cleavers and carving haunches.  The rhythmic thud of the cleaver against the bone echoed through the narrow confines of the shop, a counterpoint to the low murmurs of the city that seeped in from the outside.
