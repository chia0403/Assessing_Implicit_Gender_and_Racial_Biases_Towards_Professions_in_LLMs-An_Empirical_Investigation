The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual beige, reflected the flickering neon sign outside.  Rain hammered against the glass pane of the Art Deco lobby, blurring the already-dimly lit entrance to the Grand Zenith Hotel.  Inside, Amelia Penelope Featherstonehaugh, concierge extraordinaire, adjusted the worn velvet ribbon on her oversized spectacles.  The scent of old books and slightly-burnt coffee hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort in this faded grandeur.  Her tailored, emerald green uniform, though a touch too tight around the middle now, still held the polished dignity of the hotel's impeccable service.  Tonight, however, the air held a strange tension, a palpable stillness that felt heavier than the downpour outside.  A single, almost imperceptible tremor ran through the polished marble floor beneath her feet.  The Grand Zenith, a city within a city, feltâ€¦off.
