The scent of sandalwood and something faintly metallic hung heavy in the air of "The Clipper's Cut," a barbershop tucked away on a cobbled side street of Old Oakhaven.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grimy windowpane, illuminating a flurry of freshly-cut hair clinging to the worn wooden floor.  Bartholomew "Barty" Finch, a man whose silvered hair was meticulously sculpted into a neatly trimmed comb-over, meticulously sharpened his razor.  Each flick of the blade against the steel produced a satisfying *clink*, a small symphony in the quiet shop.  Barty’s face, etched with the lines of countless satisfied (and occasionally disgruntled) customers, was focused, his brow furrowed in concentration. He wasn’t just cutting hair; he was shaping narratives, listening to the unspoken anxieties and whispered secrets that flowed through the conversations he overheard.  The rhythmic hum of the city outside was muted here, replaced by the gentle clinking of shears, the murmur of conversation, and the distinct, almost ritualistic, sigh of each client as they settled into the barber's chair.
