Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the Ashworth High School guidance office, a relentless tattoo that mirrored the frantic rhythm of Amelia Hawthorne's thoughts.  The fluorescent lights hummed, casting a sterile glow on the overflowing files and stacks of student reports that littered her small, windowless office.  Outside, the town of Oakhaven, nestled in the foothills of the Whisper Mountains, seemed to hold its breath, the silence amplified by the drumming downpour. Amelia, a guidance counselor with five years of experience at Ashworth, felt the pressure building, a tangible weight in her chest.  This wasn't just another Monday.  This was the day the results of the crucial standardized tests, the tests that determined academic trajectories and, potentially, destinies, were due. And the whispers circulating around the hallways already hinted at disaster.  The test scores, as always, carried a heavy weight, a consequence of the socioeconomic disparities that burrowed themselves into the town's soul, a harsh reality reflected in the polished facades of the town's affluent homes and the worn-down buildings of the working-class neighborhoods.
