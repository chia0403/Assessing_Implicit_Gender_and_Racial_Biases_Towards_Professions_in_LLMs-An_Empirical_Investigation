The chipped porcelain sink, stained a faded rose, reflected the flickering neon sign outside.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of "Scissors & Smiles," a salon barely clinging to the edge of the city's fading grandeur.  Inside, Amelia Nightingale, with her perpetually windswept auburn hair tied back in a practical braid, meticulously trimmed a strand of emerald green hair.  Her client, a woman named Elara, with eyes the colour of stormy seas and a face etched with the lines of countless whispered secrets, sat patiently, humming a tuneless melody that echoed the rhythmic snip-snip of Amelia's shears.

The salon, tucked away on a side street known for its ghostly quiet and even more ghostly whispers, was a study in contrasts.  Sunlight, fractured and filtered through the grime-coated windows, dappled the walls adorned with faded posters of 1980s pop idols.  Dust motes danced in the air, illuminated by the single bulb hanging precariously from the ceiling, casting long, theatrical shadows on the worn velvet chairs.  The scent of rosemary and lavender, a carefully maintained ritual, battled with the lingering smell of rain and something faintly metallic, a constant undercurrent in the air.
