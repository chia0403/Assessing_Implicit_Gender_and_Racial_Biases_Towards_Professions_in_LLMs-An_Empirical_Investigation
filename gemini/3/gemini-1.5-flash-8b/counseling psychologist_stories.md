The chipped Formica countertop reflected Dr. Eleanor Vance's tired eyes.  Rain hammered against the single, grimy window of her tiny office, a relentless percussion mirroring the frantic rhythm in her chest.  Across from her,  a young woman,  Sarah Miller, fidgeted with the frayed edge of a worn blanket.  Sarah’s anxiety, palpable in the air, coiled around Eleanor like a viper. The office, tucked away on a side street of the perpetually overcast city of Ashwood, smelled faintly of stale coffee and desperation.  Grey, oppressive skies, reflecting in the dull, clouded windows, seemed to press down on the entire room, mirroring the weight of Sarah’s unspoken fears.  Eleanor, a counseling psychologist with seven years of experience, felt the familiar pang of empathy, a burden that had become almost a second skin.  This particular case, however, felt different. It was more than just a routine session of anxiety; it was something… deeper.
