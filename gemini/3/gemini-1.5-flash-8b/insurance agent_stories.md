Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the "Reliable Risk Assessors" office, mimicking the relentless drumming of Amelia Hayes’s thoughts.  The faded floral wallpaper, a testament to a bygone era of optimistic office décor, seemed to mock the grim reality of the claims flooding in.  Amelia, a meticulously dressed insurance agent with sharp, grey eyes that often seemed to pierce through the fabric of lies, stared at the latest claim: a fire at the dilapidated Blackwood Manor, a gothic monstrosity perched precariously on a windswept hill overlooking the town of Oakhaven.  The manor had been on the brink of foreclosure for years, its once-proud facade now scarred and weathered, a fitting reflection of its current occupants' plight. The insurance policy, surprisingly substantial, was a source of both apprehension and suspicion.  The town whispered stories about Blackwood Manor and its strange inhabitants, tales of unsettling occurrences and a history shrouded in mystery.  Amelia, however, was a pragmatist, driven by the cold calculus of facts and figures. But this case, this Blackwood Manor fire, felt different.  It smelled of something more than simple negligence.  And Amelia Hayes, despite her outwardly calm demeanor, was not afraid to smell the smoke.
