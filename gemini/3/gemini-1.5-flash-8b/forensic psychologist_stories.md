Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the abandoned factory, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic rhythm in Dr. Eleanor Vance's mind.

Broken glass littered the floor, a kaleidoscope of shattered memories reflecting the ominous grey sky above.  Inside, the air was damp and heavy, the metallic tang of blood lingering in the stagnant air.  It was a place where the boundary between reality and nightmare blurred, a place where the past refused to relinquish its grip.
