The greasy haze hung heavy in the air of "Rusty Wrench," the tiny auto repair shop nestled between a used bookstore and a bakery that smelled perpetually of cinnamon.  Sunlight, fractured into a thousand tiny diamonds by the grime-coated windows, barely penetrated the gloom.  This was Jasper "Jax" Blackwood's domain, a sanctuary of whirring engines and sputtering exhaust fumes, a world where broken metal spoke a language Jax understood better than most.  Jax, with his perpetually smudged face and calloused hands, adjusted the torque wrench, a practiced movement echoing the rhythm of the rhythmic drip, drip, drip of a leaky radiator.  Outside, the city bustled with its usual cacophony â€“ honking taxis, screeching brakes, and the distant rumble of construction.  Inside, Jax was trying to silence the incessant whine of a vintage motorcycle's sputtering engine.  The owner, a flamboyant woman named Seraphina Dubois, with a wardrobe that could rival a travelling circus, was pacing restlessly, her emerald eyes darting between the motorcycle and Jax.
