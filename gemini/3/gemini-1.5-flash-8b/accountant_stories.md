The fluorescent lights of the accounting firm, "Numbers & Nuggets," hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Fairfax's meticulously organised life.  Amelia, a junior accountant with a perpetually neat bun and sensible beige cardigan, stared at the spreadsheet.  Rows of numbers, meticulously entered, danced before her eyes, a dizzying kaleidoscope of figures representing the fluctuating fortunes of various small businesses.  The year-end audit was looming, a mountain of paperwork and sleepless nights stretching before her.  The scent of stale coffee and the faint whisper of hushed conversations filled the air, a symphony of late-night work.

**Setting:** The office, a nondescript, windowless building on a bustling city street.  The air was thick with the scent of recycled air and cheap printer toner.  Rows of identical desks, each with a computer monitor displaying rows and columns of figures, stretched as far as the eye could see.  The only natural light came from the flickering fluorescent bulbs above, casting a sterile, clinical glow over the scene.  Ameliaâ€™s cubicle, a small enclosure of beige and grey, was situated near the back of the office, a testament to her junior status.  The hushed murmur of voices from the other cubicles and the clatter of keyboards created a subtle, insistent background noise that punctuated the silence of the late-night work session.
