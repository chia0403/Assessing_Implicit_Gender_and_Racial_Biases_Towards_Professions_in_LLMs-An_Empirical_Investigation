The biting wind whipped Amelia Nightingale's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks.  The skeletal branches of the ancient oaks, clawing at the bruised sky, seemed to mock the handful of tourists huddled beneath the awning of the crumbling castle gatehouse.  October in the Scottish Highlands was a relentless mistress, and Amelia, despite her tweed coat and waterproof boots, felt the chill seeping into her bones.  This was her tenth year guiding the "Whispers of the Highlands" tour, and each year, the relentless weather felt more like a personal attack.  Today, however, the air held a different, almost palpable tension.  A hush had fallen over the group, punctuated only by the occasional rustling of leaves and the distant, mournful cry of a curlew.

The setting:  The ruined castle of Dunvegan, perched precariously on a windswept ridge overlooking Loch Dunvegan.  Dust motes danced in the fading light, highlighting the grey stone walls, scarred with time and hardship.  Jagged pieces of broken glass, remnants of shattered windows, littered the ground, like fallen teeth scattered around an ancient, forgotten tomb.  The loch, a mirror reflecting the bruised twilight sky, seemed to hold its breath, watching the tourists and their guide with an unnerving silence.  The air vibrated with an almost tangible sense of history, a whisper of centuries past, lost and waiting to be discovered.
