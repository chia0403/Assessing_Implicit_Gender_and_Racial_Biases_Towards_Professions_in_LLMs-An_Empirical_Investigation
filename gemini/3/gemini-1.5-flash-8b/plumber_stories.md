The flickering neon sign of "Mr. Fix-It Plumbing" cast a sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked alley.  Water, a relentless, insistent drumbeat, hammered against the corrugated metal siding.  Inside, Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, a plumber of unyielding optimism and slightly-too-tight trousers, wrestled with a particularly stubborn drainpipe.  He swore under his breath, a sound lost to the torrent of rain.  Barty, despite his meticulously-maintained tools and years of experience, was facing a classic plumbing conundrum, a seemingly-insurmountable blockage in the basement of the dilapidated, three-story apartment building across the alley.  The building, known locally as the "Whispering Walls" for the persistent sighing noises that emanated from within, was a monument to forgotten grandeur.  Its once-proud facade was now marred by chipped paint and gaping windows, hinting at the forgotten stories whispered within its crumbling walls.  Barty, a man whose life revolved around unclogging drains and untangling pipes, was about to confront a problem that extended far beyond the simple flow of water.
