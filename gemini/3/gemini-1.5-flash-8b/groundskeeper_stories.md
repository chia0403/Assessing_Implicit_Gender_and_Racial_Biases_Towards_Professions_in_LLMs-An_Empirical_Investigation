The chipped paint of the gazebo, a faded, sickly yellow, seemed to mock Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield as he wrestled the stubborn ivy.  He'd been meticulously pruning the vine for the better part of an hour, his calloused hands slick with sweat, the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves filling his nostrils.  The air, thick with the humidity of a late summer afternoon, hung heavy over the sprawling estate of Blackwood Manor, a place Barty knew intimately, a place that was both his prison and his sanctuary.

Blackwood Manor, a gothic monstrosity of grey stone and shadowed eaves, clung to the side of a steep hill overlooking the town of Oakhaven.  Twisted, ancient oaks clawed at the sky, their gnarled branches reaching across the manicured lawns.  Paths, meticulously swept and edged, wound their way through meticulously arranged flowerbeds bursting with vibrant colours; a testament to the careful, almost obsessive, attention paid to the upkeep of the estate by those who lived within.  Barty, however, saw only the silent, watchful gaze of the house itself, a constant reminder of the invisible lines that separated him from the lives unfolding inside its shadowed walls. He was, after all, just the groundskeeper.
