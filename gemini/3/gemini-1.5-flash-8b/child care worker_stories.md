The fluorescent lights of the "Little Explorers" daycare hummed, a monotonous drone that Amelia Blackwood found oddly comforting.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun filtering through the grimy windowpanes of the room, illuminating the colourful blocks scattered across the floor.  Today, however, the usual cacophony of giggling and squabbling was muted.  A peculiar stillness hung in the air, punctuated only by the rhythmic click-clack of Amelia's heels against the linoleum floor.  She was checking the nap schedule, the tiny paper slips tucked neatly into the plastic pockets of the cubbies.  Autumn leaves, still clinging to the branches outside, painted the brick walls with a muted palette of oranges and reds.  Amelia, a seasoned childcare worker with five years under her belt, knew the subtle shift in the air, the quiet before the storm.  This morning, the storm felt particularly heavy.
