The aroma of freshly baked sourdough hung thick in the air, a comforting blanket around the tiny bakery tucked between a bustling market stall and a crumbling, ivy-clad antique shop.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless percussion that echoed through the cramped space, punctuated only by the rhythmic *thwack* of Amelia “Amy” Butterfield’s flour-dusted hands as she kneaded a ball of dough.  Amy, twenty-seven years old and with a cascade of unruly brown curls escaping her worn apron, was the heart and soul of "The Golden Crust," a bakery more renowned for its heartwarming sourdough than its extravagant displays.  The shop, bathed in the warm glow of a single, flickering bulb, buzzed with the low hum of conversation and the contented sigh of customers savoring the scent of cinnamon rolls and freshly brewed coffee.
