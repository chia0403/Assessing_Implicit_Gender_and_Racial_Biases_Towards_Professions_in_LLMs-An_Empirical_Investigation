The chill wind, biting like a starved wolf, whipped across the desolate, grey peaks of the Sunstone Mountains.  Dust devils danced across the cracked earth, swirling fragments of obsidian and flint into the already-murky air.  High above, the jagged peaks clawed at a sky the colour of bruised plums, hinting at the storm brewing.  This was the domain of  Alistair Stoneheart, stone cutter, and his small, windswept village, nestled in a shallow valley between the towering, unforgiving crags.  Alistair, his weathered face a roadmap of sun and frost, surveyed the enormous, grey block of granite before him.  It was a beast, a monolithic guardian, seemingly hewn from the mountain itself, and destined to become a testament to the enduring strength of the land.  This particular stone, they called the Serpent's Spine, held an unspoken history, a whispering resonance that both exhilarated and terrified Alistair.  His life was bound to the rhythm of this stone, as immutable and unforgiving as the mountains themselves.
