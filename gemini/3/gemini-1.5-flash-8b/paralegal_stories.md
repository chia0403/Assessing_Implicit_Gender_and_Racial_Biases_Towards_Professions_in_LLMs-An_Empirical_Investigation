The fluorescent hum of the law firm, a constant, low-thrumming drone, vibrated through Amelia Nightingale's tired bones.  Empty coffee cups, like miniature, chipped tombstones, lined her cluttered desk.  Paperwork, mountains of it, crested the edges of her overflowing in-trays, each file a miniature universe of legal battles, emotional turmoil, and financial ruin.  Amelia, a paralegal at the prestigious firm of Sterling & Sterling, felt the familiar knot of dread tighten in her stomach.  It was Wednesday, the day the partners' meetings always fell on, the day the whispers about impending layoffs always circulated like a toxic cloud.

Setting:  The sterile, polished floors and imposing mahogany furniture of Sterling & Sterling, a high-rise law firm nestled in the heart of the bustling, rain-slicked city of Metropolis.  Windows, reflecting the grey urban landscape, offered no escape from the relentless pressure of the courtroom dramas unfolding within the firm's walls. The office smelled of stale coffee, expensive cologne, and the faint, metallic tang of fear.  The oppressive atmosphere hung heavy in the air, palpable even in the quiet corners of the office.
