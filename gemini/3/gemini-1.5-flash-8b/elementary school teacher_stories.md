The chipped paint on the windowsill, the faded floral wallpaper, and the persistent scent of old paper and slightly-sour milk hung heavy in the air of Ms. Amelia Hawthorne's classroom.  It was a Tuesday, the kind that always seemed to drag on, a grey Tuesday in the heart of a grey October.  Amelia, a thirty-two-year-old elementary school teacher with eyes the colour of warm caramel and a smile that always seemed a little hesitant, surveyed her students.  They were a kaleidoscope of unruly energy, a symphony of whispered conversations and rustling papers, all buzzing around the quiet hum of the old, antique clock ticking on the far wall.  Her classroom, nestled on the third floor of Oakhaven Elementary, felt more like a library than a place of learning; bookshelves overflowing with stories, whispered secrets, and the hopes and dreams of countless children.  The sun, barely peeking through the clouds, cast long, dramatic shadows across the room, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air.
