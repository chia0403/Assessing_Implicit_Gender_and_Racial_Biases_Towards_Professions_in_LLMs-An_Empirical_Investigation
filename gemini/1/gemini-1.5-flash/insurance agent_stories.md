The chipped porcelain of Amelia Hawthorne's coffee cup warmed her hands, a small comfort against the November chill that seeped through the drafty windows of her office.  Rain lashed against the panes, a relentless drumming that mirrored the persistent thrum of anxiety in her chest.  Amelia, a woman whose life was usually as meticulously organized as her filing cabinet – alphabetically, of course, by policyholder surname – found herself profoundly unsettled.  Her office, a cramped space above a bakery on the cobbled streets of the historic, yet slightly decaying, town of Oakhaven, smelled faintly of cinnamon and impending doom.  The scent of burnt sugar, usually a comforting aroma, only amplified the unease clinging to her like the damp air itself.  The flickering neon sign of “Percy’s Pastries” downstairs cast a sickly yellow glow on the water-stained ceiling, highlighting the cracks that spiderwebbed across its surface, mirroring the cracks beginning to appear in Amelia's otherwise perfect life.
