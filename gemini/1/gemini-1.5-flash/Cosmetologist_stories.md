The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a perfume as familiar to Seraphina "Sera" Dubois as her own reflection.  Sera, a cosmetologist with hands as nimble as a hummingbird's wings and a smile that could charm the scales off a mermaid, surveyed her salon, "Shear Perfection," with a critical eye.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sunbeams slicing through the oversized windows, illuminating the plush velvet chairs and the gleaming chrome of the styling stations. Outside, the bustling streets of New Orleans' French Quarter pulsed with a life that mirrored the vibrant chaos within Sera's own heart â€“ a kaleidoscope of personalities, secrets, and the ever-present undercurrent of magic that seemed to seep from the very cobblestones.  The chipped paint on the windowsill, a faded postcard of a grinning gargoyle perched precariously above a crumbling cathedral, seemed to wink knowingly at her.  Today was going to be a day unlike any other.
