Ria's salon, "Sol y Luna," nestled on Ocean Drive, was a haven of calm amidst the chaotic energy of the city; a sanctuary where anxieties melted away with every expertly applied gloss and perfectly shaped brow.  Today, however, the usual serenity was fractured by a nervous energy that hummed beneath the surface, a tremor Ria felt as keenly as the slight tug of a stubborn strand of hair.
