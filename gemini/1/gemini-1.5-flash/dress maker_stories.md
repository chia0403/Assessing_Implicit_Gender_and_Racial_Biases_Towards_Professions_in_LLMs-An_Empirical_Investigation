The scent of lavender and beeswax hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the relentless chill of the November wind rattling the windowpanes of Madame Evangeline Moreau's atelier.  Evangeline, her fingers nimble as a spider spinning its web, meticulously stitched a cascade of iridescent sequins onto a silk bodice the colour of a twilight sky.  Her workshop, tucked away on a cobbled lane in the heart of old Montmartre, was a chaotic symphony of silks, satins, and velvets â€“ bolts of fabric piled high, skeins of thread spilling from overflowing baskets, and half-finished gowns draped artistically over mannequins of varying heights and sizes.  The faint hum of her Singer sewing machine provided a steady rhythm to the quiet click of her needle, punctuated by the occasional sigh of contentment escaping her lips.  Outside, the Parisian twilight deepened, painting the sky in hues that mirrored the very fabric she was working with.  Tonight, however, the usual romantic charm of the city was overshadowed by a palpable tension, a prickling unease that even the comforting aroma of her workspace couldn't quite dispel.
