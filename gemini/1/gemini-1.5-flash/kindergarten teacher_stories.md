The chipped paint of the miniature firetruck, its once-bright red now faded to a dusty rose, peeled away under Ms. Eleanor Vance’s careful thumb.  Dust motes, illuminated by the weak October sun slanting through the grimy window of her classroom, danced in the air.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the ancient panes of the Willow Creek Elementary School, a building that had seen better – and significantly warmer – decades.  Inside, however, the air hung thick with the scent of crayons, slightly burnt coffee, and the lingering sweetness of spilled juice – the familiar, comforting aroma of a kindergarten classroom clinging to the end of a long, chaotic day.  Eleanor sighed, the sound swallowed by the hum of the ancient radiator struggling to fight off the creeping chill.  Another Tuesday, another mountain of paperwork awaiting her.  But first, the firetruck needed rescuing.
