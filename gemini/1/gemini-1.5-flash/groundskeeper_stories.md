The dawn mist clung to the manicured lawns of Blackwood Manor like a shroud, clinging stubbornly to the dew-kissed blades of grass as Elias Thorne, head groundskeeper, began his day.  The air, still cool despite the rising sun, carried the scent of damp earth and freshly cut roses, a familiar perfume that had been Elias's companion for thirty years.  Blackwood Manor itself, a gothic behemoth of grey stone, loomed over him, its countless windows like vacant eyes staring out at the sprawling estate.  The ornate wrought-iron gates, perpetually polished to a mirror sheen by Elias's own hand, stood sentinel at the entrance, guarding the secrets held within the manor's aged walls.  This morning, however, the usual tranquility was shattered by a discordant note â€“ the frantic chirp of a robin, unusually agitated, flitting nervously around a newly disturbed patch of earth near the old oak tree at the edge of the rose garden.
