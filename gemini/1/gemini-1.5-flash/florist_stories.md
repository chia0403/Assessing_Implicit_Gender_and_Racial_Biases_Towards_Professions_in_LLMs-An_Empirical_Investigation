The scent of rain-soaked petrichor mingled with the heady perfume of lilies and jasmine, clinging to the damp cobblestones of Lavender Lane.  Mist, thick as a shroud, clung to the gaslights, casting a hazy glow on the rain-slicked window of “Petals & Promises,” a tiny shop overflowing with blooms in every imaginable shade.  Inside, amidst a riot of colour and fragrance, Amelia Rose Hawthorne, her fingers stained a delicate shade of rose from handling a particularly stubborn bunch of David Austin roses, carefully arranged a cascading bouquet of vibrant sunflowers.  The bell above the door chimed a melancholic tinkling, a sound swallowed almost immediately by the gentle hum of the refrigerator and the rhythmic snip-snip of Amelia's shears.  Outside, the storm raged, mirroring the turmoil brewing inside her own heart.
