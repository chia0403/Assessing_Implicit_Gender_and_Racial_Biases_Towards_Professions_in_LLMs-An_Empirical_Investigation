The chipped Formica tabletop vibrated faintly under the weight of Amelia Hernandez's forearm as she leaned against it, the rhythmic hum a counterpoint to the clatter of dishes and the low thrum of conversation swirling around her in the bustling diner.  Grease clung to the air, a familiar, comforting scent that mingled with the sharp tang of bleach and the sweet, syrupy aroma of freshly brewed coffee.  Amelia, her name stitched in faded thread onto the pocket of her worn-out apron, surveyed the scene with a weary but practiced eye.  It was 7:17 AM, Tuesday, and already the "Short Stack Special" rush was in full swing at the Golden Spoon Diner, a twenty-four hour beacon of greasy goodness on the edge of Highway 17. Outside, the pre-dawn sky was still a bruised purple, hinting at the day's relentless heat yet to come.  But inside, the Golden Spoon was a cozy, chaotic island of warmth, a stage where Amelia, the ever-efficient, ever-observant server, played her part with quiet grace.
