The rasping cough that wracked Elias Thorne's body each dawn was as familiar as the smell of sun-baked earth clinging to his overalls.  He'd woken to it again this morning, a thin, insistent sound that echoed the desolate landscape surrounding his farm, Widow's Creek.

The air hung heavy with the scent of dust and desperation, a far cry from the lush green promise of spring.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of despair, danced across the cracked earth, mimicking the frantic turmoil in Elias's gut.  This year, Widow's Creek wasn't just dry; it felt cursed.
