The fluorescent lights of Mildred McMillan's tax preparation office hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the annual avalanche of paperwork.  Mildred, a woman whose neatly-coiffed auburn bun betrayed a meticulous nature that extended to every aspect of her life, meticulously organized the overflowing in-trays.  Each folder, a meticulously labeled testament to her clients' financial lives â€“ from the humble retiree's sparse earnings to the wildly complicated returns of the local entrepreneur, Bartholomew "Bart" Butterfield III, who seemed to have a separate offshore account for each of his eleven dachshunds.  The air smelled faintly of stale coffee and the slightly metallic tang of desperation; a scent as familiar to Mildred as the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of her perfectly manicured fingernails against her calculator.  Outside, the relentless Chicago wind howled a mournful dirge, a fitting counterpoint to the anxieties swirling within her cluttered office, anxieties that were about to reach a fever pitch.
