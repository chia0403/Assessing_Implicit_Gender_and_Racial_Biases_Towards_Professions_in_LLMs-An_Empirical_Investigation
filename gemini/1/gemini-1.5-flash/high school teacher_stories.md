The chipped paint of the classroom clock, a relentless metronome ticking away the last vestiges of Friday afternoon, mirrored the frayed edges of Ms. Eleanor Vance’s patience.  Dust motes, illuminated by the slanting October sun, danced in the hazy air of Room 307 at Northwood High.  The air itself hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and teenage angst, a familiar perfume Eleanor had grown accustomed to over her seventeen years teaching AP English.  Outside, the vibrant colours of the New England foliage were a mocking contrast to the drab, institutional green of the walls, a constant reminder of the vibrant life she felt increasingly disconnected from.  Today, however, the usual Friday lethargy was amplified, thick and suffocating like a damp wool blanket. Even the usually boisterous chatter of her students was muted, replaced by a nervous hum that vibrated through the floorboards.  Something was different.  Something was…wrong.
