The salt spray stung Amelia Blackwood’s face as she wrestled the stubborn fishing net onto the small, rocking boat.  Amelia, author of the wildly successful "Whispers of the Kraken" series, usually preferred the scent of old paper and brewing coffee to the tang of the sea, but this remote island, shrouded in mist and the mournful cries of gulls, was proving to be an unexpectedly fertile ground for her next novel.  The tiny village of Port Blossom clung precariously to the cliffside, its brightly painted houses a stark contrast to the brooding grey sky above.  A single, winding cobblestone path, slick with sea mist, was the only access to the cluster of dwellings, each seemingly clinging to the rocks with the tenacity of the island’s hardy inhabitants.  Amelia, bundled in a thick wool sweater despite the summer month, shivered, not entirely from the cold.  It was the unsettling quiet, the palpable sense of something ancient and watchful lurking beneath the surface of the idyllic scene, that truly chilled her to the bone.
