The midday sun beat down on the corrugated iron roof of Dr. Alistair Finch's dental surgery, baking the already stifling air of the outback town of Coober Pedy.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of red earth, danced across the desolate landscape visible through the single, dusty window.  Inside, the air conditioning struggled valiantly, a pathetic whine competing with the rhythmic whir of Alistair's dental drill, currently paused mid-procedure.  Alistair Finch, a man whose perpetually tired eyes hinted at a life spent battling both cavities and the harsh realities of rural dentistry, wiped a bead of sweat from his brow with the back of his hand, the gesture smudging a fine layer of chalky white dust across his already flour-dusted overalls.  The patient, a grizzled opal miner with a gap-toothed grin that could curdle milk, shifted uncomfortably in the worn leather chair.  The smell of antiseptic and something vaguely metallic, possibly blood mingled with the acrid tang of the opal dust clinging to everything in Coober Pedy, hung heavy in the air.
