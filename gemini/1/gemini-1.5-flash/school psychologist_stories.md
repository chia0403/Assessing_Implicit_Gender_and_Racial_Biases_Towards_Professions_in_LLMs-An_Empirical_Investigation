The fluorescent lights of Northwood High hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the chaotic symphony of slamming lockers and adolescent chatter echoing down the hallway.  Dr. Eleanor Vance, her sensible cardigan pulled tight against the lingering chill of the October morning, navigated the teenage throng with the practiced ease of a seasoned ship captain navigating a stormy sea.  The scent of stale coffee and something vaguely chemical – possibly hairspray, possibly despair – hung heavy in the air.  Today, however, the usual adolescent anxieties felt amplified, a low thrum of unease vibrating beneath the surface of the school's bustling energy.  A gnawing feeling, like a loose floorboard in an old house, warned Eleanor that something was amiss, something beyond the typical teenage drama.  It was in the strained smiles, the averted gazes, the almost imperceptible flinches, that she sensed it - a darkness creeping into the brightly lit corridors of Northwood High.
