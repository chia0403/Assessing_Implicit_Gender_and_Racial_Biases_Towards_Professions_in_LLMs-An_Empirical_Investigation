The chipped paint of Amelia Jean Blackwood's desk matched the state of her inbox: a chaotic, layered mess of vibrant, slightly-off hues.  Rain lashed against the tall, gothic windows of her office, a relentless percussion accompanying the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of her fingers on the keyboard.  The air in the attic room of Blackwood & Co. Publishers hung thick with the scent of old paper and brewing Earl Grey – a smell Amelia found both comforting and suffocating, depending on the day.  Tonight, it leaned toward suffocating.  Outside, the London sky churned a bruised purple, mirroring the storm brewing inside her as she stared at the manuscript sprawled across her desk, its title – *The Serpent's Kiss* – mocking her with its elegant calligraphy.  This wasn't just any manuscript; it was the culmination of years of work, her own gamble on a debut author whose potential, Amelia was increasingly unsure of, felt as precarious as the crumbling plaster on her office ceiling.
