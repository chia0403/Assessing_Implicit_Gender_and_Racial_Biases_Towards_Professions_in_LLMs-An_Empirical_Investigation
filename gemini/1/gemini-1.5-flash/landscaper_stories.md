The dawn mist clung to the manicured lawns of the exclusive Seabrook Estates like a shroud, clinging to the dew-kissed blades of fescue and whispering secrets only the early risers could hear.  Elias Thorne, his breath puffing out white clouds in the pre-sunrise chill, surveyed his kingdom.  Not a kingdom of crowns and castles, but one of meticulously pruned hedges, vibrant flowerbeds bursting with color despite the season, and the quiet majesty of ancient oak trees that had stood sentinel over Seabrook for centuries.  His worn leather work gloves were already damp with morning dew, a familiar and comforting weight.  The air, sharp with the scent of damp earth and freshly cut grass, promised another long but satisfying day for Elias, a landscaper whose artistry was as renowned in these affluent circles as the fortunes of its residents.
