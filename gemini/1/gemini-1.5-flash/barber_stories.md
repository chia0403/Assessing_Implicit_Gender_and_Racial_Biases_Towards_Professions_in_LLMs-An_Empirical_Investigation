The scent of Bay Rum and stale coffee hung thick in the air, a familiar perfume to Silas Blackwood, owner and sole proprietor of Blackwood's Barbershop.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grimy window, illuminating the swirling chaos of his shop:  a chipped porcelain sink stained a perpetual rust-brown, overflowing ashtrays overflowing with crushed Camel cigarettes, and a mismatched collection of barber chairs – one a plush, vintage beauty, another a battered steel monstrosity – all positioned around a scarred mahogany counter.  Outside, the relentless rhythm of the city, the cacophony of car horns and distant sirens, provided a constant, low hum against the quiet snip-snip-snip of Silas's shears. This was Silas's domain, a small, unassuming island of calm in the churning sea of New Orleans's French Quarter.
