The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume that clung to Aurelia Josephine Blackwood like a second skin.  Aurelia, or Auri as most of her clientele called her, surveyed her salon – "Shear Perfection" – with a practiced eye.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sunbeams that slanted through the tall, arched windows of her Victorian-era shop, illuminating the gleaming brass fixtures and the rows of meticulously arranged hair products.  Outside, the cobblestones of Willow Creek Lane glistened after a recent shower, the rhythmic splash of a nearby fountain a counterpoint to the gentle hum of her hair dryer.  It was a Tuesday, typically a slow day, but Auri felt a prickle of unease, a premonition that this particular Tuesday was about to become anything but ordinary.
