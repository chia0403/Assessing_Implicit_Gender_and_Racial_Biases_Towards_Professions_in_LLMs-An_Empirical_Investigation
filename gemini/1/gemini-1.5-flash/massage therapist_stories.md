The scent of lavender and sandalwood hung heavy in the air, a comforting balm against the relentless drumming of the rain against the leaded-glass windows of Serenity Spa.  Water cascaded down the outside of the building, blurring the neon glow of the "Open" sign into a hazy, ethereal glow.  Inside, however, the atmosphere was one of calm, deliberate quiet.  Candles flickered softly, casting long shadows across the polished wooden floors.  Amelia Grace Hawthorne, a massage therapist with hands as skilled as any surgeon's, adjusted the soft, plush towels on the massage table.  The rhythmic patter of rain was a constant, soothing percussion to her already practiced calm; it was a soundtrack perfectly suited to the work she was about to undertake.  Tonight, however, the tranquility felt fragile, threatened by a storm brewing not just outside, but within the walls of Serenity Spa itself.
