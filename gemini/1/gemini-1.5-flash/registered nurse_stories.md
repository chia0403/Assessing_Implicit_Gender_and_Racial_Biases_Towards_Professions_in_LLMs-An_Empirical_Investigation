The sterile scent of antiseptic, usually a comfort to Eleanor Vance, RN, felt suffocating tonight.  Fluorescent lights hummed a discordant symphony above her, reflecting harshly off the polished linoleum floor of the Nightingale Memorial Hospital's emergency room. Rain lashed against the panoramic windows, blurring the already hazy city lights into a smeared watercolour of grey and black.  Eleanor, her usually crisp white uniform rumpled and stained with a suspicious brown substance (definitely not coffee), leaned against the cool metal of a gurney, the rhythmic beep of a heart monitor a counterpoint to the frantic shouts echoing from the trauma bay.  It had been one of *those* nights â€“ the kind that made her question everything, even the small, comforting rituals that usually saw her through twelve-hour shifts.  Tonight, the comforting rituals felt as futile as a prayer in a hurricane.
