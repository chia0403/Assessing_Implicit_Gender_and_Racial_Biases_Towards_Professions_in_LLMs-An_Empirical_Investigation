The fluorescent lights hummed a discordant tune above Elias Thorne, a low thrum that vibrated through the cracked linoleum floor of the Blackwood Academy gymnasium.  Dust motes, illuminated like tiny constellations, danced in the pale beams, catching the tired gleam in Elias’s eyes.  The air hung heavy with the lingering scent of sweat, old varnish, and something vaguely chemical – the ghost of a thousand basketball games, wrestling matches, and cheerleading practices.  Tonight, however, the cavernous space was silent, save for the rhythmic squeak of Elias’s mop bucket wheels against the polished wood.  Outside, a November wind howled, rattling the ancient windows, a counterpoint to the quiet efficiency of Elias’s movements.  He was a creature of habit, of the night, a silent guardian of Blackwood Academy's secrets, hidden amongst the shadows and the discarded gym socks.
