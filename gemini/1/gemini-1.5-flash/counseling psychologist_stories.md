The chipped porcelain mug warmed Dr. Eleanor Vanceâ€™s hands, a meager defense against the November chill that seeped through the drafty windows of her office. Rain lashed against the panes, a relentless percussion accompanying the rhythmic ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner.  Her office, nestled in the attic of a rambling Victorian house on the outskirts of Inverness, was a haven of comforting chaos.  Books overflowed from shelves, spilling onto mismatched armchairs and a worn Persian rug.  The air smelled faintly of old paper, pipe tobacco (a lingering scent from the previous occupant), and the subtle, earthy aroma of the lavender sachets tucked into the corners.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune, a fitting soundtrack to the storm brewing within Eleanor herself.  This wasn't just the usual pre-client jitters; this felt different, deeper, a premonition of something unsettling about the appointment scheduled for three o'clock.
