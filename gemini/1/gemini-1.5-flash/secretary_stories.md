The chipped porcelain of Mildred Beatrice Periwinkle’s teacup warmed her fingers, a small comfort against the November chill that seeped through the drafty window of Mr. Fitzwilliam’s office.  Rain lashed against the gothic panes, mirroring the tempest brewing within Mildred herself.  The air in the imposing, oak-panelled office of Fitzwilliam & Sons, Solicitors, hung thick with the scent of old leather, damp wool, and the faint, metallic tang of fear.  Mildred, a woman whose life was usually as meticulously organized as her meticulously filed paperwork, felt a tremor of unease settle deep in her stomach.  It wasn't the rain, nor the approaching deadline for Mr. Fitzwilliam's notoriously demanding tax returns; it was the unsettling silence emanating from the inner sanctum, a silence usually punctuated by the sharp crackle of Mr. Fitzwilliam's voice and the frantic tapping of his ever-present fountain pen.  This silence, this unnerving quiet, hinted at something far more ominous than a missed filing deadline.
