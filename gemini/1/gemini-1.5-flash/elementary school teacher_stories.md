The chipped paint of the "Welcome to Mrs. Eleanor Vance's Third Grade" sign flaked onto the already dusty windowsill.  Dust motes, illuminated by the weak October sun slanting through the grimy panes, danced in the still air of Room 207 at Oakwood Elementary.  Eleanor Vance, a woman whose auburn braid was perpetually escaping its elastic, sighed, the sound swallowed by the quiet hum of the ancient radiator struggling to fight off the creeping chill.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the aging windows in their frames, a sound that mirrored the unease twisting in Eleanor's stomach. This wasn't just the usual pre-Monday dread; something feltâ€¦off.  The air itself seemed heavy, pregnant with a silence thicker than the dust clinging to everything in her classroom.
