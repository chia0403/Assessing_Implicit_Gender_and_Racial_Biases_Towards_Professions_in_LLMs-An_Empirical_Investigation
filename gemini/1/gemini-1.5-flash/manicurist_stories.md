The scent of acetone and lilac hung heavy in the air, a perfume as familiar to Seraphina "Sera" Dubois as the rhythmic rasp of her nail file.  Her salon, "Lacquer & Lore," nestled on the cobbled side street of Rue du Soleil in the heart of the ancient French quarter of New Orleans, was bathed in the hazy, late afternoon light.  Sunlight, filtered through the dusty lace curtains, dappled the worn wooden floors and the chipped paint of the walls, illuminating the tiny, overflowing shelves crammed with vibrant nail polishes, each bottle a tiny jewel promising a transformation. Outside, the sounds of the city – a mournful jazz saxophone, the rumble of a streetcar, the cheerful chatter of tourists – blended into a comforting background hum.  Sera, her fingers stained a delicate shade of amethyst, hummed along, expertly shaping a client's thumbnail with a practiced grace that belied the storm brewing beneath her seemingly calm exterior. Tonight, however, the familiar rhythm of her work was disrupted by a client unlike any she'd ever seen before.
