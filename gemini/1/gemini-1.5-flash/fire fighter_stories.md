The acrid bite of woodsmoke clung to the air, thick and cloying like a shroud.  Amelia “Mia”  Stone, a veteran of the Redwood Creek Fire Department, coughed, the taste gritty on her tongue.  Around her, the towering redwoods, usually majestic sentinels, were reduced to skeletal frames, their once vibrant canopies replaced by a malevolent ballet of flickering flames.  The air vibrated with the relentless crackle and roar of the inferno, a symphony of destruction playing out under a bruised, smoke-choked sky.  The fire, christened the “Crimson Claw” by the news crews circling miles above, had been raging for three days, consuming everything in its path – homes, businesses, and now, threatening to engulf the historic town of Redwood Glen itself.  Mia’s boots crunched on a carpet of ash and broken branches, the ground still radiating heat even through her heavy fire-resistant boots.  Tonight, the fight for Redwood Glen felt less like a battle and more like a desperate prayer.
