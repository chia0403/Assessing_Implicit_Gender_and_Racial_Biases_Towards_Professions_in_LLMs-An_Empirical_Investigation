The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Jack Stratton’s office, a relentless percussion accompanying the even more relentless drip, drip, drip from a leak somewhere near the ceiling.

The scent of rain-slicked asphalt and cheap cigarettes hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to a man who made his living in the city’s underbelly.  Tonight, however, the usual hum of urban decay was punctuated by a nervous tapping at his door.
