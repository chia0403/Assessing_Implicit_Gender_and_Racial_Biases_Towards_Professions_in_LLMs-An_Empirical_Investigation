The dawn bled orange and bruised purple across the asphalt ribbon of Highway 17, painting the towering redwoods lining its edge in hues of fire and shadow.  A thin layer of fog, clinging low to the ground like a reluctant ghost, muffled the distant roar of trucks that would soon become a deafening symphony.  Elias Thorne, his breath misting in the pre-dawn chill, adjusted the worn brim of his hard hat and hefted his shovel.  The metallic clang against the gravel was a familiar and comforting sound, a counterpoint to the unsettling quiet that always preceded the morning rush.  The air, thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, carried a hint of diesel and the underlying metallic tang of spilled oil – the usual perfume of Elias’s workday.  He was alone, for now,  on this isolated stretch of highway, miles from the nearest town, his only companions the ancient trees and the ever-present hum of the unseen traffic approaching like a slumbering beast.
