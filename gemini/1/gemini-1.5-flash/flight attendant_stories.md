The recycled air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and simmering resentment.  Amelia Hernandez, her name a whisper against the roar of the engines, adjusted the tiny, almost comically inadequate safety card in its pocket.  Outside, the sun bled a bruised purple across the Atlantic, painting the clouds in hues of impending storm.  Flight BA249 to London Heathrow was an hour from landing, and Amelia already felt the familiar tremor of exhaustion settling in her bones.  She'd seen this flight too many times: the businessman hunched over his laptop, furiously replying to emails; the elderly couple, their hands clasped tight, murmuring in a language she couldn't understand; and the inevitable crying baby, its wail a counterpoint to the gentle hum of the engines.  Tonight, however, a different kind of unease prickled at her skin. It wasn't the usual pre-landing jitters; this was something colder, something sharper, lurking in the shadows of the cabin.  The feeling started subtly, a misplaced glance, a hushed conversation, a flicker of movement at the back of the plane that she couldn't quite place, but it was there, a persistent discord in the otherwise predictable symphony of a transatlantic flight.
