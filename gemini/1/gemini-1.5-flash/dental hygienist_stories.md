The sterile scent of ozone hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Dr. Eleanor Vance,  a scent that usually calmed her.  But today, the hum of the suction machine felt like a discordant drone in the otherwise silent pre-dawn hours of the Aspen Dental clinic.

Eleanor, however, was already knee-deep in a mountain of paperwork â€“ insurance claims, patient files, and the ever-present reminder of the upcoming biannual dental hygiene conference in Denver, a trip she was both dreading and desperately needing.  The quiet solitude of the clinic before the morning rush was usually her sanctuary, but today, a gnawing unease pricked at her, sharper than the prickle of a new toothbrush.
