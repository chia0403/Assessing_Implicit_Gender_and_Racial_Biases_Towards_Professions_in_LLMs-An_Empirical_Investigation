The fluorescent lights of "Quick Stop" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Hernandez's otherwise silent evening.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the already indistinct neon signs of the surrounding strip mall into streaks of lurid color.  The only other sound besides the rhythmic *thwip* of the price scanner was the occasional cough from Mr. Henderson, the night shift manager, who was currently engrossed in a crossword puzzle, his brow furrowed in concentration.  Amelia, perched on her stool behind the chipped Formica counter, idly chewed on the end of a pen, her gaze drifting from the perpetually damp pavement outside to the meager selection of candy bars displayed behind her.  Another slow Tuesday night at Quick Stop, another night lost to the relentless drone of the hum and the ceaseless patter of the rain.
