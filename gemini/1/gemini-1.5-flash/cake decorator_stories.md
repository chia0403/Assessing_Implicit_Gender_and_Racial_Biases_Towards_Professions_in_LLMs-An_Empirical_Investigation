The scent of almond extract and vanilla hung heavy in the air, a sweet, cloying perfume that clung to everything in Amelia Rose Cartwright's tiny bakery.  Dust motes, illuminated by the afternoon sun slanting through the grimy windowpanes of "The Flour Child," danced in the shafts of light, swirling around the precarious stacks of cake boxes and bags of flour. Amelia, her hands stained a kaleidoscope of sugary hues, delicately piped a cascade of buttercream roses onto a three-tiered wedding cake, the pristine white frosting a stark contrast to the chaotic charm of her workspace.  Outside, the relentless London drizzle hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a soundtrack to the rhythmic swish of her piping bag.  The air thrummed with a low hum – the gentle whir of the refrigerator, the steady tick-tock of the old grandfather clock in the corner, and the almost imperceptible beat of Amelia's own anxious heart.  Tonight was the night. Tonight, she was decorating the cake for Lord Harrington's daughter's wedding, a cake that could make or break her reputation – and possibly, her tiny, beloved bakery.
