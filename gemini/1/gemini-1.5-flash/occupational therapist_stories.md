The salt spray stung Amelia “Mia” Hernandez’s face as she wrestled the stubborn sail of her small sailboat, the *Resilience*, against the unpredictable gusts whipping in from the Pacific.  The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum sinking towards the horizon, cast long shadows across the churning grey water of Monterey Bay.  Seagulls, their cries echoing the mournful rhythm of the waves, wheeled overhead.  Mia, however, felt anything but mournful. The rhythmic pull of the ropes, the bracing against the wind, the feel of the salt spray – it was the perfect antidote to the sterile, brightly-lit world of her occupational therapy practice.  She’d spent the morning coaxing movement back into the stiff, arthritic fingers of a retired fisherman, a man whose life, like the sea itself, had been shaped by unrelenting forces. Now, she was reclaiming a piece of her own life, a sliver of wildness amidst the demanding routine of her days.  The scent of brine and kelp hung heavy in the air, a sharp contrast to the antiseptic smell of the clinic she was leaving behind.
