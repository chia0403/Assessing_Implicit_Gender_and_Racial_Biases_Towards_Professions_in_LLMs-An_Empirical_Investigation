Tonight, however, the usual comforting chaos of barking dogs, chirping birds, and the occasional disgruntled hiss from a grumpy cat was muted by the ferocity of the storm.  A deep, unsettling silence hung in the air, broken only by the rhythmic creak of the ancient manor house and the relentless drumming of snow against the weathered stone.
