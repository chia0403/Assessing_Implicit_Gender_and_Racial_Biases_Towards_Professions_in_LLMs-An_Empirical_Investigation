The humid Louisiana air hung heavy, thick with the scent of honeysuckle and impending rain.  Cicadas buzzed a relentless, drowsy symphony that competed with the rhythmic *click-click-click* of Amelia Jean Duboisâ€™s mortar and pestle.  Inside her tiny, cluttered pharmacy, "Dubois Drugs," the air was cooler, a haven from the oppressive heat, yet still thick with the aroma of countless tinctures, syrups, and the ever-present scent of old paper and dusty shelves.  Sunlight, fractured by the heat-warped windowpanes, cast dappled shadows across the worn oak counter, illuminating the rows of amber bottles and apothecary jars that lined the walls, a testament to generations of Dubois family remedies.  Amelia Jean, her dark hair pulled back in a practical bun, meticulously ground the ingredients for a custom cough syrup, her brow furrowed in concentration.  The old-fashioned bell above the door jingled, announcing the arrival of her next customer, and with it, the promise of another story unfolding within the four walls of Dubois Drugs.
