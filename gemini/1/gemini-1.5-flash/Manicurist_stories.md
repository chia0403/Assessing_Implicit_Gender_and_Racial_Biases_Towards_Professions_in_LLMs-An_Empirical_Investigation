The chipped turquoise paint of the "Nails of Nirvana" sign flaked onto the cracked asphalt like forgotten dreams.  Inside, however, a surprisingly vibrant fuchsia glowed, casting a rosy light on the meticulously organized manicure station.  The air hung thick with the scent of acetone and something sweeter â€“ perhaps the vanilla-infused cuticle oil that Seraphina Evangeline Thistlewick, owner and sole operator of Nails of Nirvana, favoured.  Seraphina, a woman whose age was as carefully concealed as the imperfections beneath a flawless gel overlay, hummed a jaunty tune, her nimble fingers working magic on a client's already impressive set of talons.  The late afternoon sun slanted through the dusty window, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the air, a fittingly dramatic backdrop to the quiet drama unfolding in her little salon, tucked away on a forgotten corner of Bleecker Street.
