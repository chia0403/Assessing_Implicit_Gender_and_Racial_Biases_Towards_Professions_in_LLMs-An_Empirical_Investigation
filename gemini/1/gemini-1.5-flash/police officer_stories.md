The salt spray stung Detective Inspector Ava Thorne’s face as the November wind whipped her hair across her eyes.  She wrestled it back, the damp strands clinging to her forehead like seaweed.  The desolate stretch of beach, a ribbon of grey sand backed by crumbling cliffs the colour of bruised plums, offered little comfort against the howling gale.  The air, thick with the smell of brine and something else – something faintly metallic and sickeningly sweet – clung to the back of her throat.  It was the smell of death, a smell Ava Thorne knew all too well.  The body, partially submerged in the churning surf, was just visible now, a dark shape tossed by the unforgiving waves, a grim offering to the unforgiving sea.
