The scent of rosemary and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume unique to "Shear Perfection," a salon nestled between a dusty antique shop and a perpetually-empty bakery on Bleecker Street.  Rain lashed against the large, mismatched windows, each pane a different shade of grime-coated glass, blurring the already hazy gaslight glow of the late November evening.  Inside, however, a warm, almost stifling heat radiated from the antique radiators, hissing softly as they fought the encroaching chill.  Amelia Josephine Hawthorne, owner and sole stylist of Shear Perfection, hummed a jaunty tune as she meticulously swept stray hairs from the checkered floor, her nimble fingers as familiar with the broom as they were with a pair of shears. The only sound louder than the rhythmic sweep was the steady drumming of rain against the glass, a soundtrack to her solitary evening.
