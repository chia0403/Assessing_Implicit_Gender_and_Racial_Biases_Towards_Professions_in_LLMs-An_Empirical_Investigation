The humid Louisiana air hung heavy and thick, a suffocating blanket clinging to Amelia Jean Dubois as she wrestled the stretcher into the back of the ambulance.  Cicadas buzzed a relentless, high-pitched symphony, their song a counterpoint to the erratic thump-thump-thump of her own heart.  The air smelled of honeysuckle and impending rain, a perfume that did little to mask the metallic tang of blood clinging to the cracked asphalt of Bayou Teche Road.  Amelia, a paramedic with seven years and countless near-death experiences under her belt, wiped sweat from her brow, the faint taste of salt mingling with the lingering metallic scent.  The flashing lights of her ambulance painted the gnarled cypress trees lining the bayou in an eerie strobe effect, illuminating the scene â€“ a twisted mess of metal and shattered glass under the bruised purple of a twilight sky.  Tonight, the bayou wasn't whispering secrets; it was screaming for help.
