The biting November wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vance’s dark hair across her face as she wrestled the heavy oak door of the Blackwood Manor open.  Rain, driven by a gale that seemed intent on tearing the ancient stone edifice from its moorland perch, plastered her coat to her back.  Blackwood Manor, perched precariously on a cliff overlooking the churning grey expanse of the North Sea, was less a house and more a brooding gothic monument to forgotten grandeur.  Ivy, thick as a man’s arm, clawed at the crumbling stonework, its tendrils snaking like skeletal fingers across decaying window frames. The air hung heavy with the scent of brine, damp earth, and something else… something faintly metallic and unsettling, that hinted at the secrets the manor held within its decaying walls.  Eleanor shivered, pulling her collar higher, the chill seeping into her bones far deeper than the November wind could manage.  This was her first house call to Blackwood Manor, and already, she felt a sense of unease that had nothing to do with the weather.
