The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face as he braced himself against the railing of the *Seraphina*, a creaking fishing trawler pitching violently in the churning grey expanse of the North Atlantic.  The wind, a raw, icy beast, howled a mournful song through the rigging, whipping his thick, wool coat around him like a frantic bird.  His breath plumed out in ragged white clouds, instantly swallowed by the brutal air.  He clutched his battered Leica M6, its cold metal a comforting weight against his gloved hand, its lens pointed towards the tumultuous sea.  He wasn't here for the fish, though the trawler's hold was crammed with them, their silver scales glinting dully in the gloom. Elias Thorne was here for the light, the unforgiving, magnificent light of a dying winter's day on the desolate, windswept coast of the Outer Hebrides.  He was chasing the ephemeral beauty of the storm, hoping to capture the raw, untamed spirit of the sea on film, before it vanished, swallowed by the encroaching darkness.
