The biting Wyoming wind howled a mournful song around Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins' rig, a lonely counterpoint to the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of his eighteen-wheeler's tires on the icy Interstate 80.  Snow, thick and relentless, plastered itself against the windshield of his battered Kenworth, blurring the already fading twilight into a swirling grey canvas.  The only other visible landmarks were the skeletal shapes of wind-whipped pines clawing at the bruised purple sky and the occasional, ghostly shimmer of a distant highway marker, half-buried under a fresh layer of the white stuff. Bart, his breath misting in the frigid air, wrestled with the steering wheel, his knuckles white against the worn leather.  The radio crackled with static, offering no solace, only a reminder of the vast, isolating emptiness that surrounded him.  He was halfway through a cross-country haul, hauling a load of frozen beef destined for Chicago, and already, he was beginning to doubt heâ€™d make it to Cheyenne before the storm truly hit.
