The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful song around Captain Evelyn "Evie" Reed's battered Cessna 185, whipping snow into a frenzy that obscured the already fading light.  Below, the Chugach Mountains, jagged teeth bared against the bruised purple sky, clawed at the bruised grey clouds.  Evie, her breath frosting in the frigid air, wrestled with the controls, the small plane bucking like a wild bronco as it fought the relentless downdraft.  The radio crackled with static, a mocking counterpoint to the drumming of her heart.  Her destination: a remote research station clinging precariously to the side of a glacier, a place where few dared to venture, and even fewer returned. This flight, however, wasn't about the weather; it was about a man named Silas, and a package Evie was sworn to deliver, no matter the cost.
