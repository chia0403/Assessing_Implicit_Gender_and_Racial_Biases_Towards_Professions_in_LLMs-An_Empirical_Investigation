The rusty swing of the butcher’s cleaver echoed in the pre-dawn chill, a metallic counterpoint to the rhythmic slap of rain against the corrugated iron roof of Bartholomew “Barty” Butterfield’s shop.  Barty, a man whose girth suggested a lifelong acquaintance with his own wares, hunched over a side of beef the size of a small pony.  The air hung thick with the scent of blood, rendered fat, and woodsmoke – a familiar perfume in the grimy, cobbled alleyway behind his butcher shop, "Butterfield's Best," nestled between a crumbling bakery and a perpetually shuttered pawnbroker’s on the less-than-salubrious Grimsborough Lane.  The gaslight sputtering weakly outside cast long, distorted shadows that danced with the flickering candlelight illuminating his work. Grimsborough itself, a city perpetually shrouded in a fine drizzle, felt as ancient and worn as the cleaver in Barty's hand.
