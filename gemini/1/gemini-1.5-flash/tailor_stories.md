The scent of lavender and beeswax hung heavy in the air, a comforting shroud against the biting November wind howling outside.  Rain lashed against the single, grime-streaked window of Elias Thorneâ€™s tailor shop, blurring the gaslight's feeble glow into a hazy orange smear.

His shop, nestled on a cobbled side street in the shadowed heart of London's Whitechapel, was a haven of quiet industry, a sanctuary from the harsh realities of the city that pressed in on all sides.  The thread, a fine silk the colour of a raven's wing, glinted under the dim light, reflecting in the silver spectacles perched on Elias's sharp nose.
