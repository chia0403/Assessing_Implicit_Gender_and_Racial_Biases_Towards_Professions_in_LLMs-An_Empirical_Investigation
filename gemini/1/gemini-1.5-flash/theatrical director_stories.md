The stale scent of sawdust and forgotten dreams hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Alistair Finchley, director extraordinaire (or at least, that's what his mother called him).  Dust motes, illuminated by the single, bare bulb hanging precariously above, danced in the cavernous space that was once the grand ballroom of Blackwood Manor, now his makeshift rehearsal space.  Cracked plaster peeled from the high ceilings, revealing glimpses of the faded, once-opulent frescoes beneath.  The grandeur was long gone, replaced by a poignant decay that mirrored, Alistair thought with a sigh, the current state of his theatrical career.  Tonight, however, the decay would be transformed. Tonight, Blackwood Manor would breathe again, not with the echoes of lavish balls, but with the raw, vibrant energy of his new production: *The Raven's Shadow*.
