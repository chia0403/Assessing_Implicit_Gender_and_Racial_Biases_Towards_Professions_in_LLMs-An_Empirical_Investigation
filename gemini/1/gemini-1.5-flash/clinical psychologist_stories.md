The chipped paint of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office window framed a relentless grey November sky, mirroring the mood that seemed to have settled permanently over her city.  Rain lashed against the glass, a relentless drumming that matched the persistent thrum of anxiety in her own chest.  Her worn, leather armchair, usually a comforting haven, felt cold and unyielding tonight. The aroma of stale coffee and old books hung heavy in the air, a familiar scent that did little to alleviate the unease that clung to her like the damp chill seeping in through the ill-fitting window frame.  Outside, the neon glow of the city blurred through the downpour, a chaotic kaleidoscope of light and shadow.  Inside, Eleanor Vance, PhD, clinical psychologist, sat staring at a blank notepad, the weight of a particularly disturbing case pressing down on her, heavier than any rain-soaked November ever could.
