## Story Opening and Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The hum was back, a persistent mosquito whine in the otherwise clean static. Evelyn Hayes cursed under her breath, her fingers dancing across the dials of the ancient Marconi transmitter. It always chose the worst possible time. Tonight was crucial; tonight was her chance to talk to the world. Or at least, a very small, very isolated part of it.

**Setting:**

The setting is the year 1938, on a remote, windswept island off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada. The island, known as Gannet's Reach, is populated by a handful of fishing families, a dilapidated lighthouse, and the remnants of a defunct Marconi wireless station. Evelyn works and lives within the confines of this station, a weather-beaten building clinging precariously to the cliffs overlooking the tumultuous Atlantic. The station is a jumble of dust-covered machinery, vacuum tubes glowing a ghostly orange in the dim light, and the ever-present smell of ozone and salt. The interior walls are lined with meticulously labeled dials, schematics, and notes scribbled in Evelyn's precise handwriting. Outside, the relentless wind howls and the cries of gulls echo across the desolate landscape, a constant reminder of the island's isolation and the vast, unforgiving ocean that surrounds it.
