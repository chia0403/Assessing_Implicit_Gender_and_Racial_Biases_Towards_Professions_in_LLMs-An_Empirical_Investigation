The bell above the door of "Shear Perfection" jingled a cheerful, if slightly insistent, tune as rain hammered against the awning outside. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of hairspray, coffee, and the faint, sweet perfume of Mrs. Higgins, who’d just left sporting a lavender rinse and a triumphant grin. Genevieve Marie Dubois, her own fiery red hair escaping its haphazard topknot in a flurry of defiant strands, sighed, wiping down her station.

Shear Perfection wasn't exactly *perfect,* at least not yet. Genevieve had poured every penny she had, and a good chunk of her grandmother’s retirement fund, into the tiny storefront on Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village. The turquoise paint was a little chipped, the floral wallpaper slightly dated, and the vintage swivel chairs, while charming, creaked ominously under anyone weighing more than a chihuahua. But it was hers. And after years of working for soul-sucking salons with names like "The Mane Event" and "Tress Chic," she was finally creating the kind of place where women (and occasionally men) could come to feel beautiful, not just look it.

The rain outside intensified, turning Bleecker Street into a shimmering, reflected blur of neon signs and hurried pedestrians. Genevieve glanced at the clock. Three o’clock. Her next appointment, a Professor Alistair Finch with a notoriously difficult thatch of unruly silver, was due any minute. She just hoped the professor wasn’t bringing his usual entourage of research assistants armed with clipboards and probing questions. It was hard enough fighting entropy on a Tuesday afternoon without being the subject of a sociological study.
