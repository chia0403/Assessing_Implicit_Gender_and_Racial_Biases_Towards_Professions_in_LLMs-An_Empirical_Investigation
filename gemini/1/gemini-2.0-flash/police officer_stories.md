The rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* of helicopter blades sliced through the pre-dawn silence, a counterpoint to the gentle lapping of waves against the concrete seawall below.

Crescent Bay, California. A picture-postcard town boasting a thriving tourism industry, pristine beaches, and million-dollar mansions perched precariously on the cliffs overlooking the Pacific.

A darkness she was intimately familiar with, having grown up in the shadow of its gilded gates, a child of the “wrong side of the tracks,” as her father, a retired fisherman, so eloquently put it.
