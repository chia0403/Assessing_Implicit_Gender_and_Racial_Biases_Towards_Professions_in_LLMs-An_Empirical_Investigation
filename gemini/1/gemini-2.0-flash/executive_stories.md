## Opening:

The insistent chirping of the smoke alarm was the first sign that Amelia Hayes-Sterling was awake. Not pleasantly, not gently, but jarred from a sleep so profound it felt like climbing out of a sensory deprivation tank. Groaning, she burrowed deeper into the tangled Egyptian cotton sheets, pulling the silk duvet over her head in a futile attempt to silence the piercing electronic cry. It was 6:17 AM. Precisely. The digital display on the bedside clock, a sleek, minimalist creation she’d impulse-bought during a business trip to Copenhagen, seemed to mock her with its unemotional accuracy. 

This wasn’t the way a Vice President of Global Marketing at StellarTech Solutions, a woman who commanded boardrooms and shaped international campaigns, should be starting her day. This was the way someone who’d burnt the midnight oil (and apparently, the toast) to a crisp, should be starting their day.

Finally, defeated, Amelia heaved herself out of bed, the silk negligee she’d dismissed as impractical last week now clinging uncomfortably to her overheated skin. She knew what awaited her downstairs: a charred sacrifice to her late-night obsession with finalizing the Q3 rebranding strategy. The aroma, or rather the acrid stench, of burnt bread still lingered in the air, a potent reminder of the pressure cooker her life had become.

## Setting:

Amelia's apartment occupied the top floor of a converted warehouse in the trendy Tribeca district of Manhattan. The building, all exposed brick and industrial chic, was a testament to her ambition and financial success. Floor-to-ceiling windows offered a panoramic view of the city skyline, a glittering tapestry of steel and glass that stretched towards the horizon. Inside, the apartment was a carefully curated blend of modern art, antique furniture, and high-tech gadgetry. A custom-built kitchen, usually pristine, was currently marred by the evidence of her culinary mishap. A minimalist living room, furnished in neutral tones with splashes of vibrant colour in the abstract artwork, looked out onto a small balcony overflowing with carefully cultivated herbs and flowers - a small oasis of calm in the heart of the urban jungle. The air, usually crisp and clean thanks to a state-of-the-art filtration system, was currently tainted with the lingering scent of burnt toast, a stark contrast to the refined elegance of the space.
