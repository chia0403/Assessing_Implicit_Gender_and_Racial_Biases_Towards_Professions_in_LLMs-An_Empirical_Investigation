The prairie wind, relentless as ever, whipped at the frayed edges of Jedediah Calhoun's Stetson, carrying with it the scent of dry grass and distant rain. He leaned against the weathered fence post, the splintered wood digging slightly into the small of his back, and squinted at the herd of Hereford cattle grazing on the horizon. Jedediah, all six-foot-three of him, was a man carved from the very landscape he tended - all sharp angles and weathered resilience. His face, a roadmap of deep lines etched by sun and hardship, held a perpetual squint, born from a lifetime of staring into the glaring Wyoming sun.

The setting was the Bar C Ranch, a sprawling expanse of land nestled in the shadow of the Bighorn Mountains. It was a rugged, unforgiving place, where the land demanded respect and rarely offered comfort in return. The ranch house itself was a sturdy, two-story structure built of stone and timber, its paint faded and peeling after years of battling the elements. The barn, a testament to the ingenuity and hard work of generations past, stood sentinel nearby, its doors creaking a mournful song in the ever-present wind. Beyond that lay miles of pasture, dotted with watering holes and clumps of sagebrush, stretching as far as the eye could see, a vast, untamed canvas painted in shades of brown, green, and gold.
