The salt-laced wind whipped at the edges of Elias Thorne's worn canvas apron as he stood on the precipice of the cliff, his hands gripping the splintered railing. Below him, the jagged teeth of the Porthaven coast gnawed at the churning Atlantic. He could taste the metallic tang of the sea on his tongue, a flavor as familiar as the scent of sawdust and varnish clinging to his clothes.

Elias wasn't admiring the view, breathtaking though it was. He was calculating. Assessing the damage. The storm, a furious beast that had howled through Porthaven for three relentless days, had finally subsided, leaving behind a trail of destruction like scattered bones. And Elias, being the only carpenter for miles who wasn't either too old, too drunk, or too terrified to venture out, was the one tasked with picking them up.

Porthaven itself clung to this dramatic stretch of Cornwall like a stubborn limpet. The village, a cluster of grey stone cottages huddled together for warmth and protection, was a tapestry woven from fishing nets, weathered wood, and the constant, mournful cry of the gulls. Its heart was the harbor, a small, semi-circular indentation in the cliffs where fishing boats, painted in vibrant blues and greens, bobbed precariously. The air was thick with the smell of fish, brine, and the comforting aroma of peat fires burning in the chimneys of the cottages.

The storm surge had been brutal. Elias knew, with a sinking feeling in his gut, that the damage to the harbor's breakwater was significant. He could see gaping holes punched through the granite stones, exposing the steel rods beneath, twisted and bent like discarded wire. His initial assessment confirmed his worst fears: weeks, maybe even months, of back-breaking work lay ahead. And the winter was fast approaching.

Elias sighed, the sound lost in the wind. He pulled a calloused hand through his thick, greying hair, the wind snatching at the strands. He was a man of few words, and fewer complaints. He was, after all, Elias Thorne, the carpenter of Porthaven, and repairing what was broken was simply what he did. But standing there, buffeted by the relentless wind and facing the daunting task ahead, even Elias felt a flicker of weariness, a prickle of doubt that whispered, "Can you really do this?"
