The clatter of silverware against porcelain was a familiar symphony to Elara Skye Oâ€™Malley, a comforting, if slightly grating, backdrop to her Thursday evening shift at "The Gilded Spoon." The air, thick with the scent of garlic butter, rosemary, and simmering resentments from the kitchen, hung heavy around her like a damp cloak. Outside, the Seattle rain hammered against the grand, Victorian windows, blurring the city lights into impressionistic streaks of yellow and white. Inside, The Gilded Spoon, a restaurant clinging to the last vestiges of old-world charm, hummed with a carefully cultivated ambiance of hushed conversation and clinking champagne flutes.

The restaurant itself was a relic, a testament to a bygone era of extravagant dining. Think red velvet booths, gilded cherubs leering from the ornate ceiling, and enough crystal chandeliers to make a magpie jealous. Elara, with her worn-out Converse hidden beneath her crisp white apron and a perpetual knot of anxiety twisting in her stomach, always felt a little out of place amongst the polished silver and haughty clientele. But rent was rent, and The Gilded Spoon, for all its pretension, paid on time.
