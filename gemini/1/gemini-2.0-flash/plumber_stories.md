**Opening:**

The smell, a putrid blend of sulfur and something vaguely floral that had died a long, slow death, hit Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins like a brick wall the moment he opened the crawlspace hatch. Bart coughed, pulling his bandana higher over his nose. "Right," he muttered to himself, grabbing his headlamp and trusty pipe wrench, "Let's see what horrors await."

**Setting:**

The year is 2047. Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins operates his plumbing business, Higgins' Hydro Solutions, out of a converted shipping container on the outskirts of Neo-Savannah, Georgia. Neo-Savannah is a city clinging precariously to existence, its once-gleaming skyscrapers now riddled with rust and water damage from the persistent, acid rain that plagues the Southeastern seaboard. The city's infrastructure is crumbling, a patchwork of outdated pipes and cobbled-together repairs that keep Bart perpetually busy.

Today, Bart finds himself beneath the opulent (or rather, *formerly* opulent) townhouse of Madame Evangeline Dubois, a notorious socialite known for her elaborate hydroponic gardens and even more elaborate demands. Her townhouse is one of the few remaining habitable structures in the historic district, shielded by a heavily fortified atmospheric dome that hums with an uneasy energy. Despite the dome's protection, the building suffers from the same pervasive dampness that affects the entire city, leading to a constant battle against mold, leaks, and the occasional mutated fungus bloom. The crawlspace Bart is currently navigating is a claustrophobic maze of copper pipes, corroded metal supports, and dripping condensation, the air thick with the aforementioned noxious odor and the ominous feeling that something is definitely, definitively, *wrong*.
