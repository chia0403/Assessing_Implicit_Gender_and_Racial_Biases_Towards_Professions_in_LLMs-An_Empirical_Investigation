The incessant hum of the fluorescent lights threatened to drill a hole directly into Abigail Eleanor Sterling’s skull. It was three AM, and the only other sound in the cavernous newsroom of the *Philadelphia Standard* was the rhythmic clack-clack-clack of old man Henderson's ancient typewriter three desks down. He claimed it helped him think. Abigail suspected it helped him stay awake.

Abigail rubbed her tired eyes, the grit of exhaustion clinging to them like beach sand. Spread across her desk were printouts, handwritten notes on yellow legal pads, and a half-eaten container of lukewarm chicken lo mein. She was chasing a story, a ghost of a rumour that whispered of impropriety in the city’s most hallowed halls. A story that, if proven true, could bring down some of the most powerful men in Philadelphia.

The *Philadelphia Standard*, once a titan of the news industry, was now a shadow of its former self, struggling to stay afloat in the digital age. Abigail, a recent hire and fresh out of Columbia's journalism program, was eager to prove her worth. To bring back the fire and the investigative zeal that had once defined the paper. But the weight of expectation, combined with the sheer volume of data she was sifting through, was starting to feel overwhelming.

She glanced out the window at the inky blackness pressing against the glass. Below, the city lay still, a sprawling grid of darkened buildings and hushed streets. The air hung thick with the smell of rain and exhaust fumes, a familiar perfume of urban decay. Philadelphia, the city of brotherly love, felt more like a city of secrets tonight, and Abigail Eleanor Sterling was determined to uncover them all.
