Okay, here's a story opening with a setting and a real estate agent protagonist named: **Eleanor Beatrice Albright:**

**Story Opening:**

The air in the attic of 14 Nightingale Lane smelled like forgotten dreams and dust motes. Eleanor Beatrice Albright, armed with a flashlight that cast a wavering beam across the cobweb-draped rafters, coughed delicately, pulling the silk scarf higher around her neck. "Honestly, Mrs. Hawthorne," she said, her voice echoing slightly in the cavernous space, "are you *absolutely certain* there's a hidden feature up here?"

Mrs. Hawthorne, a tiny woman swathed in layers of tweed, nodded with the resolute force of a badger. "Absolutely! My late husband, God rest his soul, always hinted at a 'surprise' he'd built into the house. Something to delight the new owners. Said it was 'just the thing' to clinch the deal."

Eleanor, a real estate agent with ten years of experience and a healthy dose of skepticism, had heard promises like this before. Usually, the "surprise" was a leaky pipe or a family of raccoons. She sighed inwardly. This house, a Victorian monstrosity crammed onto a postage stamp-sized lot in the heart of the historical district, had been on the market for months. The peeling paint, the outdated plumbing, and the general air of melancholy clinging to the place made it a hard sell, even in a seller's market. A surprise, however unpleasant, was better than nothing.

**Setting:**

The story is set in the fictional town of Oakhaven, a charmingly dilapidated New England town that clings stubbornly to its past. Think of it as a slightly faded postcard of Americana, where the leaves turn vibrant shades of crimson and gold in the fall, and the local diner still serves meatloaf every Tuesday. The houses are old, often rambling Victorians or sturdy Colonials, with overgrown gardens and secrets tucked away in their foundations. The historical district, where 14 Nightingale Lane is located, is particularly desirable, despite the upkeep required on the aging properties. There's a thriving artistic community drawn to the town's quaintness and affordable (though often requiring significant renovation) real estate. The story takes place in late October, just a week before Halloween, adding a touch of autumnal atmosphere and a hint of the uncanny. The weather is crisp, with a persistent wind that rustles through the colorful leaves and carries the scent of woodsmoke through the air.
