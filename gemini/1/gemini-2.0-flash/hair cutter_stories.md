## Opening & Setting:

The bell above the door of "The Golden Strand" chimed a cheerful, almost mocking, little tune as Alistair Finch adjusted the angle of his shears, the cool metal a welcome contrast to the sweat beading on his brow. Late afternoon sunlight, thick and syrupy, poured through the large, arched windows of his salon, painting the dusty rose walls in hues of orange and amber.  He watched a dust mote dance in a sunbeam, a tiny, weightless ballet performer in the quiet theatre of his shop. Alistair sighed.  It was Tuesday, historically the day he cut hair only for himself, if only to make sure that no one would come in to cut it incorrectly. Even with the perfect weather outside, there were very few customers in today.
The Golden Strand was located in the heart of Oakhaven, a quaint, historic town nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains.  The building itself was a Victorian-era townhouse, meticulously preserved with its original stained-glass windows depicting scenes of forest life and its ornate, mahogany trim. Oakhaven was a place where time moved a little slower, where everyone knew everyone, and where the biggest excitement of the week was usually the farmer's market on Saturday mornings. Alistair, with his meticulously styled auburn hair, his sharp wit, and his even sharper shears, had always felt a little like a flamingo in a flock of pigeons in Oakhaven. He thought the most exciting thing to happen to him today was that he actually managed to successfully brew a cup of coffee, without spilling any on the floor.
