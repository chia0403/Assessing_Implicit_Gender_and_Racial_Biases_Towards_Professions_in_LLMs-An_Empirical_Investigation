Okay, here's a story opening and setting, including a main character who is an editor:

**Story Opening:**

The smell of stale coffee and desperation hung thick in the air, a perfume Eleanor Vance had come to associate with Tuesdays. This particular Tuesday was proving especially potent. A manuscript lay open on her desk, mocking her with its rambling sentences and illogical plot points. It was titled, with a stunning lack of originality, "The Crimson Kiss," and she already knew she was going to have to perform a literary amputation to make it even vaguely publishable. Eleanor sighed, rubbing the bridge of her nose. Another day, another author convinced they were the next Hemingway, blissfully unaware of the grammatical train wreck they'd unleashed upon the world. She reached for her red pen, a weapon of mass correction, and muttered, "Alright, Crimson Kiss, let's see if we can salvage this."

**Setting:**

Eleanor Vance's small, cluttered office was located on the third floor of "The Quill & Ink Press," a small, independent publishing house nestled in the heart of Brooklyn's DUMBO neighborhood. The building itself was an old warehouse, its brick facade softened by climbing ivy and a charmingly dilapidated fire escape. Inside, exposed pipes ran along the high ceilings, a testament to the building's industrial past. Eleanor's office, roughly the size of a walk-in closet, was crammed with overflowing bookshelves, teetering stacks of manuscripts, and half-empty mugs of coffee. A vintage typewriter sat proudly on her desk, a relic she occasionally used for inspiration, or, more often, as a paperweight. Sunlight streamed through the large, grime-streaked window, offering a stunning view of the Manhattan Bridge, a stark contrast to the messy, chaotic world within. The sounds of the city – car horns, distant sirens, and the rumble of the subway – were a constant, low hum, a soundtrack to Eleanor's editing life.
