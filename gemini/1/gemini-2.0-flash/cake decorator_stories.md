## Story Opening & Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The scent of vanilla and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, clinging to the floral wallpaper and the sticky linoleum floor. Agatha Primrose clutched her piping bag, the fine tip trembling ever so slightly. Today was the day. The day she was finally attempting a gravity-defying masterpiece: a three-tiered wedding cake that looked like a cascading waterfall of sugar roses, all supporting a miniature replica of the happy couple. A challenge that, frankly, had her insides churning like a buttercream gone bad.

**Setting:**

The story takes place in "Primrose Petals," a quaint, slightly dilapidated, but undeniably charming bakery nestled on the main street of the small, picturesque town of Meadow Creek, Vermont. The building, painted a faded robin's egg blue, has been in Agatha's family for generations. The bakery itself is small, with a display case overflowing with pastel-colored cupcakes and intricately decorated cookies. A small, worn-out table sits by the window, usually occupied by the town gossip, Mrs. Higgins, and her ever-present chihuahua, Mr. Snuggles. Behind the counter lies the heart of the operation: the cramped but functional kitchen, crammed with baking sheets, mixing bowls, and Agatha's most prized possessions - her collection of antique piping tips.
