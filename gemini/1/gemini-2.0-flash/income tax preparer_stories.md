## Opening:

The fluorescent lights hummed, casting a sterile glow on the stacks of receipts that threatened to avalanche off the desk. Bartholomew "Bart" Fitzwilliam adjusted his spectacles, the bridge pinching the bridge of his nose. Outside, the April showers were doing their best to turn the already dreary Tuesday into a full-blown existential crisis. Inside, Bart was locked in mortal combat with Schedule A, and losing. He sighed, a sound like air leaking from a punctured tire, and reached for his lukewarm coffee. The lukewarmness perfectly mirrored his enthusiasm for itemized deductions. He was a man who lived and breathed Form 1040, but right now, he felt more like Form 404: Not Found.

## Setting:

Bart's office, "Fitzwilliam Tax Solutions," occupied a prime (and by "prime" we mean "cheapest") piece of real estate in the strip mall on Elm Street. It was wedged between "Bob's Discount Tires" and "Brenda's Bingo Emporium," a location choice that screamed "reliable but not exciting." The interior was a symphony of beige: beige walls, beige carpet, even a beige filing cabinet that looked like it had witnessed the invention of paperclips. The only splashes of color came from a motivational poster featuring a soaring eagle and the inspiring slogan, "Reach for the Sky!" (Bart had always found it vaguely insulting to his clients, most of whom were just trying to keep their heads above water.) Sunlight, when it bothered to appear, was filtered through the dust-coated blinds, creating an ambiance of perpetual twilight. On the desk, alongside the aforementioned receipt mountain, sat a calculator that looked like it had seen better decades, a well-worn copy of the IRS tax code, and a framed photograph of Bart's beloved beagle, Agnes, wearing a tiny accountant's visor. Agnes was, without a doubt, the most competent member of the Fitzwilliam Tax Solutions team.
