## Story Opening and Setting

**Setting:** The first tendrils of autumn were creeping into Briarwood, Massachusetts, painting the colonial-era houses in hues of burnt orange and crimson. The air, crisp and carrying the scent of woodsmoke, hinted at pumpkin spice lattes and cozy evenings by the fire. Nestled between a charming bookstore and a bakery that perpetually smelled of warm cinnamon rolls, sat "Petal Paradise," a flower shop with a history as rich and blooming as its arrangements.

**Opening:**

The bell above the door of Petal Paradise chimed, its gentle melody a familiar comfort to **Eleanor Rose Briarwood**, the shop's owner and namesake. Eleanor, her hands dusted with pollen and dirt, looked up from the vibrant bouquet of sunflowers she was arranging. A sliver of golden sunlight streamed through the window, illuminating the auburn strands that had escaped her loose braid. She wiped a smudge of soil from her cheek with the back of her hand, a habit she’d been trying, and failing, to break since she was a child playing amongst the roses in her grandmother's garden.

"Just a minute!" she called out, her voice warm and melodic, like the tinkle of wind chimes in a summer breeze. Another careful placement of a sunflower head, angled just so, and she finally turned towards the entrance, ready to greet her customer. It wasn't a customer, though. It was a box, a large, unassuming cardboard box that sat silently on the welcome mat, its plainness jarring against the vibrant tapestry of blooms surrounding it. No card, no note, just… a box. A chill, far more potent than the autumnal air outside, snaked its way up Eleanor's spine.
