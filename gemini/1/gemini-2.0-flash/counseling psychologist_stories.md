## Story Opening:

The scent of lavender and stale coffee hung heavy in the air of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, a comforting, if predictable, aroma she'd cultivated over years of practice. Outside, the November wind howled a mournful song against the Victorian windows of her brownstone practice in Beacon Hill, Boston. Eleanor shivered, despite the chunky wool cardigan draped over her shoulders, and adjusted the angle of the Tiffany lamp on her desk. It cast a warm, amber glow on the worn, but reassuringly familiar, spines of her psychology texts. She needed the light. The day, much like her last few sessions, had been relentlessly grey.

Eleanor glanced at the clock. 2:58 PM. Two minutes. Time for Mr. Abernathy. A surge of weariness washed over her. Mr. Abernathy, bless his anxious heart, was a champion ruminator, a man who could dissect a single grocery store interaction into an existential crisis of galactic proportions. Eleanor took a deep breath, straightened the stack of tissues on the side table, and practiced a small, empathetic smile in the reflection of her framed diploma from Harvard. She was, after all, Dr. Eleanor Vance, a counseling psychologist, and her job was to help people untangle the knots in their minds, even when they were feeling tangled themselves. Today, however, the knots felt particularly tight.
