The fluorescent hum of Northwood High buzzed a weary counterpoint to the inner turmoil churning within Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Ainsworth. She sat at her desk, a mountain range of paperwork threatening to avalanche any minute, and stared out the window. Beyond the grimy pane, a steady drizzle painted the already bleak November sky in shades of gray that matched her mood. Northwood High, a sprawling brick behemoth built in the 1970s, had seen better days. The peeling paint in the hallways, the overflowing garbage cans in the cafeteria, and the apathetic shrugs of most of the students painted a clear picture: a school struggling.

Ellie, Northwood's resident school psychologist, felt the weight of that struggle on her shoulders every single day. Kids whispered about her, calling her "the shrink" or "the crazy lady whisperer." She knew they didn't mean it maliciously, not usually. But the loneliness that clung to her in this place, a loneliness amplified by the endless stream of anxieties and traumas she absorbed, was starting to feel permanent. She took a deep breath, the scent of stale coffee and disinfectant doing little to soothe her frayed nerves. Today was Monday. And Mondays at Northwood High were rarely quiet.
