The clatter of ice against glass was a familiar symphony to Evelyn “Evie” Harlow. She knew its rhythm, its subtle variations depending on the type of glass and the practiced force of her wrist. Tonight, it was a frantic staccato, matching the increasingly frenzied energy of The Crimson Lantern, the dimly lit, velvet-draped cocktail bar she called her sanctuary, and sometimes, her prison.

The Lantern perched precariously on the edge of the French Quarter in New Orleans, a haven for tourists seeking a hint of gothic mystique and locals craving expertly crafted cocktails with a side of whispered secrets. Its interior was a theatrical masterpiece: heavy crimson curtains, intricately carved mahogany bar, and flickering candlelight that danced across the faces of its patrons, casting them in a perpetually dramatic glow. Antique mirrors lined the walls, reflecting the scene into an endless loop of veiled intrigue and hushed conversations. The air hung heavy with the scent of absinthe, tobacco, and a touch of something else, something vaguely…ancient. Tonight, that scent felt heavier, almost suffocating.

Evie, clad in a simple black dress and a vintage silver pendant in the shape of a crescent moon, surveyed the chaotic scene. Sweat beaded on her forehead, despite the blasting air conditioning. The music, a bluesy jazz number usually perfect for the atmosphere, now seemed to grate on her nerves. She needed a drink, a cigarette, and maybe a long, hot bath – in that order. But tonight, the relentless demands of thirsty tourists and the knowing glances of the regulars kept her rooted behind the bar, a silent observer in a play she didn't quite understand. And tonight, something felt…off. A prickling sensation on the back of her neck, a feeling of being watched, not just by the usual admirers, but by something…else.
