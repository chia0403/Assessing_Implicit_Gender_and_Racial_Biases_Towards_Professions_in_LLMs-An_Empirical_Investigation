Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a stockbroker:

**Opening:**

The ice in Jonathan Archibald Davies’s single malt did little to cool the fire in his gut. He stared out the panoramic window, a dizzying tableau of flickering city lights and snarling traffic painting the canvas of his 47th-floor corner office. The NASDAQ ticker snaked across the bottom of the glass, a constant reminder of the day’s bloodbath. Red, red, red. He’d watched fortunes vanish today, including a significant portion of his own. He took a long, slow swallow, the peaty scotch momentarily numbing the ache. He needed a plan, and he needed it before the sun dared to rise again and expose the wreckage.

**Setting:**

Jonathan Archibald Davies's office is perched high in the "Financial Crown," a glass and steel skyscraper dominating the lower Manhattan skyline. The space is a carefully curated blend of power and sophistication.

*   **The View:** The defining feature is the floor-to-ceiling, wrap-around windows offering an unobstructed view of the city, harbor, and even a sliver of the Atlantic on a clear day. The view is both inspiring and, on days like today, incredibly daunting.
*   **The Furnishings:** Deep mahogany furniture, including a massive executive desk, dominates the room. The leather chairs are supple and expensive, molded for hours of comfortable contemplation. A large, abstract piece of art (a Jackson Pollock replica, tastefully done), hangs on the back wall, adding a touch of cultured rebellion to the otherwise conservative décor.
*   **Technology:** State-of-the-art technology is woven seamlessly into the design. Hidden panels reveal multiple monitors displaying real-time market data, and a sophisticated sound system can pipe in either soothing jazz or urgent market analyses, depending on Jonathan's mood.
*   **Personal Touches:** Despite the grandeur, there are subtle personal touches. A framed photograph of Jonathan and his daughter at a Yankees game sits on the credenza, a stark contrast to the impersonal nature of his work. A well-worn copy of "Reminiscences of a Stock Operator" by Edwin Lefèvre is always within reach.
*   **Overall Atmosphere:** The atmosphere is one of controlled chaos. The air is thick with the unspoken pressures of high-stakes finance. It's a place where fortunes are made and lost, where ambition thrives, and where the city never sleeps. The overall feeling is one of overwhelming wealth, sophistication, and simmering tension.
