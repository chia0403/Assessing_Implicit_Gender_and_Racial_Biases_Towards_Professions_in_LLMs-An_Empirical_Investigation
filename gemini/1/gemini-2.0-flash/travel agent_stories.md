Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a travel agent main character:

**Setting:** A cramped, vibrantly colored office in downtown Asheville, North Carolina. The walls are plastered with travel posters: a sun-drenched Santorini, a misty Machu Picchu, a bustling Tokyo street. Shelves overflow with brochures promising adventure, relaxation, and everything in between. The air hums with the low thrum of a slightly overworked air conditioner struggling against the mountain humidity.

**Story Opening:**

The bell above the door jingled, its cheerful chime a stark contrast to the thunderous scowl brewing on the face of Eleanor Penelope Ainsworth. Eleanor, or Ellie as she preferred (unless a particularly difficult client was being obtuse about the difference between all-inclusive and a timeshare presentation), sighed and forced a smile. It was always something. A missed connection, a disastrous hotel review, or, as in the case of Mrs. Higgins last week, a rogue monkey stealing a toupee on a Costa Rican zipline tour.

"Morning, Sunshine Travel," she chirped, pushing aside a stack of visa applications threatening to avalanche onto the floor. A man stood silhouetted in the doorway, his form obscured by the late morning sun. He looked…weathered. Like he’d spent more time in a hammock under palm trees than in an office cubicle. Good. Maybe he actually needed help planning a *real* trip, not just price matching online deals like half her clientele these days. "How can I make your travel dreams come true today?"
