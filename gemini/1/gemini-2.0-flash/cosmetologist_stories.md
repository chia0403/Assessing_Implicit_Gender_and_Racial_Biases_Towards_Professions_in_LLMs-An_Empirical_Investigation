## Story Opening:

The air in "Glow Up" was thick with the scent of vanilla bean sugar scrub and a low hum of hairdryers. Outside, the relentless Miami sun beat down on Ocean Drive, but inside, it was a haven of cool, pastel-colored serenity. Anastasia "Annie" Rossi, her bright pink highlights contrasting with the crisp white of her uniform, surveyed the bustling salon with a critical eye. Her reflection stared back from the enormous, gold-framed mirror lining one wall: wide brown eyes, perpetually framed with perfectly arched brows, and a smattering of freckles dusting her nose.

Today, however, the serenity was wearing thin. Mrs. Periwinkle, a notoriously demanding client with a penchant for dramatic pronouncements and even more dramatic dye jobs, was already an hour late. Annie tapped a meticulously manicured nail against the counter, a nervous habit she tried to suppress. The appointment book was packed, and Mrs. Periwinkle's absence threw the entire schedule into disarray.

Annie smoothed down her uniform, inhaling deeply. She had built this salon, brick by metaphorical brick, from the ground up. "Glow Up" was more than just a business; it was her sanctuary, her escape, and the embodiment of her dreams. She wouldn't let a little tardiness – or even a temperamental septuagenarian – derail her.

Taking another deep breath, Annie grabbed a stack of crisp white towels and headed towards the manicure station, determined to find a way to turn lemons into lemonade. Even if that lemonade was garnished with a hefty dose of passive-aggressive gratitude.
