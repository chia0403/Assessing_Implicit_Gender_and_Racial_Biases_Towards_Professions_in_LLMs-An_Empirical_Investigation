## The Story Opening:

Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of the penthouse apartment, blurring the already dazzling cityscape into a hazy impressionistic painting. Eleanor Beatrice Vance, RD, LD, shivered, pulling her cashmere cardigan tighter. The apartment wasn’t hers, of course. It belonged to her client, Montgomery Sterling, a man whose fortune was rivaled only by his commitment to unhealthy living.

Tonight, that commitment had manifested in a full-blown, artery-clogging panic attack. Eleanor, summoned urgently, knelt beside his trembling, silk-pajama-clad form, the scent of expensive cologne and stale whiskey clinging to the air like a stubborn ghost. "Mr. Sterling, breathe," she instructed, her voice calm despite the knot of dread tightening in her own stomach. "Just follow my lead. In... and out..."

His wheezing breaths were anything but rhythmic. He clutched his chest, his face a mask of terror. "Eleanor, I... I think I'm dying. All those foie gras and late-night burgers… you were right!"

Eleanor suppressed a sigh. He was always right, until he wasn't. And now, with a potential multi-million dollar lawsuit looming in the air like the gathering storm outside, he was suddenly, conveniently, willing to admit his dietary sins.

"Mr. Sterling, we're going to get through this," she said, her voice firm. "But after this episode, we are *absolutely* eliminating bacon from your breakfast menu."

## The Setting:

The primary setting is the **ultra-modern, minimalist penthouse apartment of Montgomery Sterling, a billionaire businessman, located in the heart of downtown Chicago.** The apartment, perched atop the sleek, obsidian Sterling Tower (no relation, ironically), is characterized by:

*   **Floor-to-ceiling windows** that offer breathtaking (and somewhat terrifying, during a thunderstorm) views of the city skyline.
*   **A stark, almost sterile aesthetic:** Polished concrete floors, white walls, and sparsely placed, ultra-modern furniture. Everything is designer and expensive, yet lacks warmth.
*   **A state-of-the-art kitchen, rarely used for cooking,** but perfectly equipped for catering and displaying expensive wines.
*   **A general sense of cold opulence and isolation.** While luxurious, the apartment feels impersonal, reflecting Montgomery Sterling's detachment from genuine human connection.
*   The apartment contains a small, dedicated office space for Eleanor to work when she is on-call for Sterling. The room is more inviting than the rest of the apartment, although it still lacks personality. It's clear that Sterling only included it because Eleanor insisted on it.

The penthouse serves as a microcosm of Montgomery Sterling's life: successful, extravagant, and ultimately, unfulfilling. The stark contrast between the luxurious surroundings and Sterling's deteriorating health highlights the core conflict of the story and the importance of Eleanor's role in his life.
