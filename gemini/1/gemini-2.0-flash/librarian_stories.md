Okay, here's a story opening with a setting and a librarian named as the main character:

**Story Opening:**

The scent of aged paper and chamomile tea clung to Beatrice Eleanor Ainsworth like a comforting shroud. She exhaled slowly, the steam from her mug momentarily obscuring the view of the perpetually overcast sky through the arched window. Another Tuesday, another torrent of overdue notices to prepare. Beatrice, Head Librarian of the Blackwood Historical Society's Reading Room, found a peculiar solace in the routine. It was predictable, unlike the whispers that seemed to echo through the towering shelves when she was alone, whispers of secrets hidden within the spines of forgotten books.

Today, however, the routine was already threatening to unravel. Mrs. Gable, the society's treasurer and a woman whose floral scarves perpetually clashed with the mahogany paneling of the reading room, was due any minute to discuss the proposed budget cuts. Beatrice already knew what that meant: shorter hours, fewer acquisitions, and, worst of all, the potential culling of some of the library's most fragile and irreplaceable texts. A chill deeper than the autumn air in Blackwood settled on Beatrice's shoulders. She took another sip of her tea, steeling herself for the inevitable battle. But as she set the mug down, a small, unfamiliar package sat on her desk, wrapped in brown paper and tied with twine. No return address. Just Beatrice’s name, written in elegant, spidery handwriting that stirred a faint, unsettling memory…
**Setting:**

The Blackwood Historical Society's Reading Room occupies the west wing of Blackwood Manor, a grand, gothic-revival building perched on a windswept hill overlooking the town of Blackwood, Maine. The room itself is a cavernous space, lined from floor to vaulted ceiling with towering oak bookshelves. Sunlight, when it dares to pierce the perpetual fog of the Maine coast, filters through stained-glass windows depicting scenes from Blackwood's (mostly apocryphal) history.

Dust motes dance in the beams, illuminating the worn leather and faded gold lettering of countless volumes. Comfortable reading chairs, upholstered in faded velvet, are scattered throughout the room, each accompanied by a small, mahogany table. A large, imposing desk sits at the head of the room, overlooking the entire space, and a small, cozy alcove houses Beatrice's tiny office.

The overall atmosphere is one of quiet reverence, tinged with a hint of melancholy. The air is thick with the smell of old paper, leather, and a faint, persistent aroma of pipe tobacco, lingering from the society's previous (all-male) members. The sounds are muffled – the soft rustling of pages, the distant clang of the manor's ancient heating system, and, if you listen closely enough, the almost imperceptible whispers that seem to emanate from the books themselves.
