The stale, nicotine-tinged air of O’Malley’s was a familiar comfort to Silas Blackwood, a comfort he desperately needed at 11:30 AM on a Tuesday. Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes, blurring the neon shamrock above the door into a hazy green smudge. O’Malley’s was Silas’ unofficial office, a dimly lit haven in the heart of Chicago’s Near North Side, where the regulars knew better than to ask too many questions and the whiskey was strong enough to drown out even the most persistent inner demons. The booths were worn leather, scarred with the history of countless whispered conversations and hushed deals. A flickering fluorescent light buzzed incessantly above the bar, threatening to plunge the entire place into darkness at any moment. Silas sat tucked away in his usual corner, the newspaper spread open but unread, nursing a lukewarm coffee and trying to ignore the throbbing in his temples. He hadn't slept much the past few nights. The city, and its troubles, rarely allowed him that luxury.
