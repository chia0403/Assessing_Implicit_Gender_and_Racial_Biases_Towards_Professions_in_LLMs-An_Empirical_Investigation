## Story Opening:

The brass buttons of Archibald Featherstonehaugh's uniform glinted under the oppressive wattage of the Grand Majestic Hotel's chandelier, a shimmering halo around his already stressed brow. He straightened his posture, a reflex ingrained after fifteen years of hauling luggage and feigning enthusiasm for tips, and plastered a smile so wide it felt like it might crack his jaw. He’d seen it all – shrieking toddlers, oblivious tourists, drunken socialites – but the sight currently unfolding at the entrance to the Emerald Ballroom promised a level of chaos he hadn’t encountered even during the National Pigeon Fanciers Convention of '08. A gaggle of paparazzi, their flashes popping like fireflies in a summer storm, surrounded a woman draped in a dress that looked like a peacock had exploded, arguing with a man whose face was so Botoxed it resembled polished marble. Archibald swallowed, the knot in his stomach tightening. This was going to be one long night.

## Setting:

The Grand Majestic Hotel loomed over the city of Atheria like a gilded fortress, its art deco facade a testament to a bygone era of opulence. Located in the heart of Atheria's prestigious Velvet District, the hotel catered to the city's elite – celebrities, politicians, and titans of industry – offering a discreet haven of luxury and indulgence. The lobby was a symphony of polished marble, plush velvet, and glittering crystal. Heavy drapes kept out the harsh sunlight, creating a dim, almost theatrical atmosphere. The air hummed with the murmur of hushed conversations, the clinking of champagne glasses, and the faint strains of jazz emanating from the Crimson Lounge. Behind the reception desk, a wall of pigeonholes, each bearing a polished brass number, stretched towards the ornate ceiling, a silent testament to the countless guests who had passed through its doors. The entire place reeked of money, old money especially, and Archibald Featherstonehaugh, despite his years of service, still felt a pang of unease every time he crossed its threshold. It was a beautiful cage, he often thought, and he was one of the gilded songbirds within.
