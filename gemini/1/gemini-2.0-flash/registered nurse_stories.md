Rowena hated early mornings, but she loved the quiet that came with them. This quiet was the setting: St. Jude's Hospital, nestled in the grimy industrial heart of Pittsburgh. It was a place where grime and grace collided; where the hopeful and the hopeless were crammed into cramped wards, separated only by thin curtains and the dedication of nurses like Rowena. St. Jude's wasnâ€™t glamorous. It was old, its linoleum floors perpetually scuffed, its paint peeling in places. But it was home. It was where Rowena felt she made a difference, even if just a small one, every single day.
