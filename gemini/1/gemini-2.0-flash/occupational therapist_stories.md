## Story Opening

The biting Chicago wind howled off Lake Michigan, rattling the windows of the Lincoln Park Manor assisted living facility. Eleanor Rose Abernathy, her face flushed from the cold and her scarf wrapped twice around her neck, wrestled with the stubborn automatic doors. Finally, they shuddered open, releasing her into the antiseptic warmth and the familiar scent of lavender and lemon disinfectant.

Eleanor stamped the snow from her boots, a fleeting smile playing on her lips as Mrs. Periwinkle, the resident with the mischievous glint in her eye and a penchant for hiding silverware, yelled, "Abernathy! Finally decided to grace us with your presence, eh? Thought you'd been swallowed by the lake!"

Eleanor laughed, the sound a bright counterpoint to the muffled television chatter and shuffling footsteps. "Just about, Mrs. Periwinkle! Just about."

But under the easy banter, a knot of anxiety tightened in Eleanor's stomach. Today was the day. The day she'd been dreading for weeks.

She checked her watch – 9:57 AM. Just enough time for a quick cup of lukewarm, institution-brewed coffee before facing Mrs. Henderson.

## Setting

**Lincoln Park Manor Assisted Living Facility, Chicago, Illinois, Late January.**

The facility itself is a large, imposing brick building, softened by hanging flower baskets (now barren and covered in ice) in the summer. Inside, the decor is a mix of well-meaning but outdated: floral patterned wallpaper, plush armchairs that have seen better days, and hallways lined with framed paintings of idyllic landscapes. The air is always slightly overheated, a constant battle against the harsh Chicago winters.

The common areas, like the dining room and the recreation room, are bustling with activity, even if that activity mostly consists of napping in armchairs. There's a pervasive scent of institutional food (usually some variation of boiled vegetables and overcooked meat) mixed with the aforementioned lavender and lemon disinfectant.

Eleanor’s small office is tucked away on the second floor, overflowing with adaptive equipment: weighted utensils, ergonomic grips, and brightly colored therapy balls. It's her sanctuary, a space where she can truly connect with her patients and help them regain a measure of independence in their lives.
