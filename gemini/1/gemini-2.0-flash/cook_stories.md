The clatter of pans was a symphony to Beatrice Aurelia Bellweather. It was the kind of symphony that woke the gulls squawking over the Cornish harbor, a symphony that permeated the stone walls of "The Salty Siren," the pub-restaurant she owned and operated with more grit than glamour. The air, perpetually thick with the briny tang of the sea and the savory whispers of roasting rosemary and garlic, was Beatrice's domain.

Outside, the village of Port Periwinkle was just beginning to stir. Fishing boats, painted in a rainbow of faded blues and greens, bobbed impatiently in the harbor. A thin fog clung to the slate roofs of the fishermen's cottages, obscuring the colorful window boxes overflowing with geraniums. The salty wind whipped at the sturdy, whitewashed walls of The Salty Siren, whistling through the gaps in the ancient timbers.

Beatrice, clad in a flour-dusted apron that strained a little across her ample frame, hummed along to the rhythmic chop of her knife against the butcher block. This morning, it was red onions, destined for a fragrant tomato sauce that would simmer all day, filling the pub with a warmth that even the relentless Cornish wind couldn't extinguish. She loved this time of day, the quiet before the storm of lunchtime, the moment when she could create, fueled by strong tea and the promise of satisfying hungry bellies. But today, a knot of unease tightened in her chest, a feeling as persistent and irritating as a grain of sand in her worn leather boots. Something feltâ€¦ off.
