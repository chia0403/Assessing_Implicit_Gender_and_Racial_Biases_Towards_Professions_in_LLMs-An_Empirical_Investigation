Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a construction worker main character:

**Setting:**

The harsh, pre-dawn light of late October bit into the Colorado Rockies. The air was thin and frigid, carrying the scent of pine and the distant rumble of machinery. A massive construction site clawed its way up the side of a mountain, a wound of raw earth and steel against the backdrop of snow-dusted peaks. Cranes, like giant, skeletal birds, stood poised against the bruised purple sky, their red warning lights blinking in a rhythmic pulse. Trailers clustered at the base of the slope, emitting weak squares of light that spilled onto the muddy ground. This was the site of the "Aspen Vista" luxury ski resort, a controversial project that promised unparalleled views and, according to many locals, irreparable damage to the surrounding ecosystem.

**Story Opening:**

"Damn it all to hell," roared Jonathan "Jonny" Riley, his breath puffing out in a cloud of white as he wrestled with the frozen zipper of his Carhartt jacket. He stamped his steel-toed boots on the gritty asphalt, trying to coax some feeling back into his toes. 5:30 AM. Another day, another uphill battle, both literally and figuratively. He fished a half-smoked cigarette from his breast pocket, lit it with a flick of his Zippo lighter, and inhaled deeply. The nicotine burned a welcome path down his throat, momentarily thawing the chill that had settled deep in his bones. Aspen Vista. He hated the name, he hated the project, and, if he was being honest, he was starting to hate the man he saw reflected in the dark windows of the foreman's trailer. A man who, despite his reservations, showed up every day to help build a playground for the super-rich on sacred ground.

**Notes on Choices:**

*   **Name:** "Jonathan Riley" feels grounded and working-class, fitting for a construction worker. The nickname "Jonny" adds a touch of familiarity and approachability.
*   **Setting:** The Colorado Rockies provide a visually stunning and potentially dangerous backdrop. The Aspen Vista resort introduces conflict - the clash between wealth/development and nature/local concerns.
*   **Opening:** The opening immediately establishes Jonny's character as someone who is tough, a bit cynical, but also internally conflicted. The immediate use of dialogue grounds us in his perspective. We can infer a lot about Jonny just from his reaction to starting his workday. He doesn't love what he does and maybe dislikes aspects of the construction site, but he still shows up.
*   **Conflict:** The story hints at several layers of potential conflict: environmental concerns, class disparity, Jonny's internal struggles.

This opening aims to set a tone and suggest potential directions for the story to take.
