## Story Opening:

The scent of stale cheerios and lavender wipes hung thick in the air, clinging to Amelia Grace Carter like a second skin. It was the smell of her Tuesdays, her Wednesdays, her entire working life, really. Today, however, it was laced with something else, something sharp and unsettling, like burnt sugar mixed with ozone. Amelia paused, her hand hovering over a stack of miniature plastic chairs in the brightly coloured "Rainbow Room," and inhaled deeply. The regular cacophony of twenty-three rambunctious four-year-olds had been replaced with an unnerving silence. Where just moments before Liam had been demanding another dinosaur sticker and Sophia had been diligently finger-painting a masterpiece (mostly on herself), now there was only stillness. Amelia felt a cold dread creep up her spine, prickling the back of her neck. This was wrong. This was very, very wrong.

## Setting:

The story takes place in "Little Sprouts Early Learning Centre," a sprawling single-story building nestled in a quiet suburban neighborhood in the fictional town of Oakhaven, Massachusetts. The center boasts a manicured playground, a brightly painted facade adorned with cartoon animals, and an array of rooms dedicated to different age groups and activities. Inside, primary colours reign supreme. Walls are decorated with hand-drawn artwork, alphabet posters, and inspirational quotes about the joys of childhood. The floors are covered in durable, easy-to-clean vinyl, and every corner seems to hold a stash of toys, books, or art supplies. Despite its cheerful exterior, Little Sprouts has a slightly worn feeling, a testament to the constant stream of sticky fingers, muddy shoes, and spilled juice boxes that have passed through its doors over the years. The Rainbow Room, where Amelia works with the four-year-olds, is one of the larger rooms, filled with miniature furniture, a reading nook, and a small stage for dramatic play. A large window looks out onto the playground, offering a view of the swings, slides, and sandbox.
