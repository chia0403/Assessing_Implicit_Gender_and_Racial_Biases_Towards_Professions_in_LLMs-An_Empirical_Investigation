Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a phlebotomist:

**Opening:**

The fluorescent lights of the St. Jude's Community Clinic hummed a relentless, monotonous tune, a sound that typically faded into the background for Imogen Anastasia Blackwood. Tonight, however, the hum vibrated right through her, echoing the anxieties churning in her stomach. She’d drawn blood from thousands of arms in this clinic, stuck needles into veins as delicate as spiderwebs and as stubborn as old rope, calmed the fears of children and the shaky hands of the elderly. But tonight, Imogen's own hands felt clammy, her pulse a hummingbird trapped in her chest. Dr. Alvarez’s frantic phone call three hours ago, the hurried, hushed tone, kept replaying in her mind. "Imogen, you're the only one I trust with this," he’d said. "It has to be you." Now, standing before Room 3, the simple white door felt like the entrance to a labyrinth, and the patient waiting within, less a nameless entry in her appointment book, and more an unknown threat.

**Setting:**

The story is set primarily in St. Jude's Community Clinic, located in the unassuming, working-class neighborhood of Havenwood. The clinic is a modern, albeit sterile, building constructed in the late 90s. The exterior is mostly beige brick with large, tinted windows that let in plenty of natural light during the day. However, at night, the artificial lighting takes over, casting a clinical, almost harsh glow.

Inside, the clinic is meticulously clean, but shows subtle signs of wear and tear from the constant flow of patients. The walls are painted a calming seafoam green, decorated with generic posters promoting healthy living and various medical information. The waiting room is furnished with comfortable, yet practical, vinyl chairs, a magazine rack overflowing with dog-eared copies of outdated magazines, and a small television perpetually tuned to a daytime talk show.

The exam rooms are small and sparsely furnished, each containing an examination table covered in crisp white paper, a stainless-steel sink, a rolling stool, and a medical cabinet filled with various supplies. Room 3, the location of Imogen's current anxiety, is identical to the others, except for a small, almost imperceptible scratch on the edge of the examination table – a detail Imogen has noticed countless times over the years. The air always carries the faint, lingering scent of antiseptic and fear.
