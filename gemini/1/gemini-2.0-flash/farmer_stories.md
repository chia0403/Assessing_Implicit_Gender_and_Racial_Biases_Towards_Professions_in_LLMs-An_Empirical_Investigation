The oppressive July heat hung thick and heavy over Harmony Creek like a wet wool blanket. Sweat beaded on Jedediah Elijah Carter's forehead, stinging his eyes as he wrestled with the jammed auger on the grain silo. Jedediah, a man built like an oak and weathered like barn wood, cursed under his breath. He was a farmer to his very bones, the same bones that had tilled this land for five generations. But today, the land seemed to be fighting back.

Jedediah's farm, Carter Family Farms, encompassed a sprawling expanse of rolling fields that stretched as far as the eye could see, a patchwork quilt of golden wheat, emerald soybeans, and dusty brown earth still waiting to be planted. The farmhouse, a sturdy two-story Victorian with peeling white paint and a wrap-around porch, sat nestled amongst a grove of ancient oaks, a silent sentinel watching over the generations that had toiled within its walls. To the east, the creek that gave the town its name gurgled lazily, a shimmering ribbon of silver winding its way through the parched landscape. The setting sun, a molten orange orb sinking towards the horizon, cast long, dancing shadows across the fields, painting the scene in hues of fire and gold. It was a beautiful scene, a postcard-perfect image of rural America, but Jedediah couldn't appreciate it. He had crops to harvest, debts to pay, and a feeling deep in his gut that this year, something was very, very wrong.
