The stale scent of Elmer's glue and disinfectant wipes hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Miss Eleanor Abigail Finch. It was 7:15 AM on a Tuesday, and the sun, a hazy lemon slice, was just beginning to nudge its way over the horizon. Eleanor stood in the center of her domain, Classroom 3B at Bumblebrook Elementary School, a miniature kingdom soon to be overrun with twenty-two five-year-olds and their sticky fingers.

Bumblebrook itself was a town that seemed to have been designed specifically for the kind of life Eleanor led. Nestled in the rolling hills of western Massachusetts, it was all clapboard houses with pumpkin patches in the fall and snow-dusted pines in the winter. The air was clean, the traffic light, and the gossip...well, the gossip was generally harmless, revolving mostly around bake sales and the annual Christmas tree lighting ceremony.

This particular Tuesday, however, felt different. A quiet hum of unease vibrated just below the surface, a premonition Eleanor couldn't quite shake. She straightened the haphazardly hung alphabet chart, adjusted the misshapen clay animals perched precariously on the windowsill, and took a deep breath. Today, something was going to happen.
