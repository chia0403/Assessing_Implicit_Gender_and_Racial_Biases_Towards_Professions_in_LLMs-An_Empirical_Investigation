## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The red dust of the Pilbara region in Western Australia swirled around the cab of the massive Komatsu D475A-5 bulldozer. The relentless sun beat down on the corrugated iron roof, baking the interior to a sweltering 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit), even with the air conditioning cranked to its max. In the distance, the iron ore mountains, scarred and sculpted by decades of mining, rose like slumbering titans. This was the "Red Dog" iron ore mine, a sprawling scar on the otherwise ancient landscape.

**Story Opening:**

Agnes "Aggie" Kowalski spat a wad of chewing tobacco into the makeshift spittoon, a dented Foster's oil can, and wiped her brow with the back of her calloused hand. The sweat stung her eyes, but she barely registered it. She had more pressing concerns. The blast crew had just finished prepping Section 4 for its morning detonation, and Aggie, behind the controls of her behemoth bulldozer, was tasked with clearing the overburden – the layer of rock and dirt that obscured the precious iron ore beneath.

Aggie Kowalski, all five-foot-four of her, looked tiny in the cockpit of the D475A-5, but the machine roared at her command. She’d been wrestling these metal beasts since she was barely old enough to drive a car. Her grandfather, a Polish immigrant who'd come to Australia in the 60s looking for a better life, had taught her everything she knew. He’d always said, “Aggie, these machines, they listen to you. You gotta feel them, understand their power, and treat them with respect.”

Today, though, the D475A-5 wasn't listening. It was sluggish, unresponsive. Aggie felt a familiar knot of anxiety tighten in her gut. She'd reported the lagging hydraulics yesterday, but the maintenance crew, overworked and understaffed as always, had brushed her off. "Probably just a bit hot, Aggie. She'll cool down overnight."

But it wasn't cooling down. And Aggie Kowalski had a bad feeling about this. Today was the day they were expecting the CEO to visit the mine. The day everything had to be perfect. And a malfunctioning bulldozer was far from perfect.
