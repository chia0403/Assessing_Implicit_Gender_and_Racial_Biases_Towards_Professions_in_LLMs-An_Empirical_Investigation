The aroma of stale coffee and the low hum of the fluorescent lights were constant companions to Beatrice Eleanor Plumtree. It was 6:17 AM on a Tuesday, and she was already hunched over a monstrous spreadsheet on her aging Dell desktop, the screen glowing a sickly blue against her tired face. The setting was her office cubicle in the heart of "Accounting Row," a particularly soul-crushing section of the sprawling offices of "Sterling Consolidated Industries," a company that manufactured everything from industrial-grade adhesives to those little plastic forks you get with takeout.

Beatrice's cubicle was a monument to quiet desperation. A chipped ceramic mug with a picture of a frowning cat sat precariously close to the keyboard. Scattered across her desk were half-eaten granola bars, several pens that had long since run out of ink, and a laminated photo of her niece, Lily, dressed as a fairy princess, a stark reminder of the vibrant life that existed beyond the beige walls of Sterling Consolidated. The overall impression was less "efficient workspace" and more "archaeological dig site documenting the slow decline of a human spirit." Today, however, Beatrice felt a flicker of something other than existential dread. A whisper of...anticipation? It was audit day. And this year, Beatrice Eleanor Plumtree had a secret weapon.
