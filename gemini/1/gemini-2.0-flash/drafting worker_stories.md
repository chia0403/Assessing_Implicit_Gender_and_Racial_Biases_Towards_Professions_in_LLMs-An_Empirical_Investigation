Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a drafting worker:

**Setting:**

The fluorescent lights of Krieger & Sons Architectural Renderings hummed a monotonous tune, a constant background drone to the scritch-scratch of pencils and the gentle whir of oversized printers. The office, a cramped second-floor space above a perpetually-closed laundromat, smelled perpetually of cheap coffee and the slightly metallic tang of graphite dust. Drafting tables, scarred with decades of architectural plans and coffee rings, were crammed together like teeth in a crowded mouth. Yellowing posters of iconic skyscrapers, circa 1970, clung to the walls, a nostalgic reminder of a bygone era of architectural ambition. Outside, the incessant rumble of Brooklyn traffic bled through the thin, single-paned windows.

**Opening:**

"Damn it all to hell and back!" Eleanor Josephine Petrovich hissed, smacking her forehead against the cool surface of the drafting table. The faint impression of her pencil grip left a grey smudge on her skin. For three days she'd been wrestling with the blueprints for Mrs. Rosenblatt's extension â€“ a frankly hideous sunroom addition that threatened to clash with the pre-war charm of her brownstone. And now, staring back at her from the meticulously drawn elevation, was a glaring, fundamental, completely idiotic error. The damn window wasn't centered. Not even close.

Eleanor, a woman whose patience usually ran thicker than the lead in her 2H pencil, felt a headache bloom behind her eyes. This wasn't just about symmetry. It was about principle. It was about the sacred duty of a draftsman to translate vision into tangible, accurate reality. And this... this was an abomination.
