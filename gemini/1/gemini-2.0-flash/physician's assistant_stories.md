## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights of the emergency room hummed, a sterile counterpoint to the cacophony of coughs, groans, and clipped orders that filled the air. Abigail "Abbey" Rosewater, Physician's Assistant, scrubbed her hands at the stainless steel sink, the scent of antiseptic clinging to her skin like a second perfume. The repetitive motion usually calmed her, a grounding ritual in the face of the daily chaos, but tonight it offered little solace. She'd seen a lot in her five years at St. Jude's, a relentless parade of humanity at its most vulnerable, but the young boy, barely clinging to consciousness after the hit-and-run on Elm Street, had shaken her to her core. His small, battered body lay somewhere behind those curtained partitions, a fragile life hanging precariously in the balance.

She squeezed her eyes shut, willing away the image. A wave of nausea threatened, and she took a deep, shaky breath. Focusing on the task at hand, she dried her hands and surveyed the organized chaos of her supply cart. She needed to be ready for whatever Dr. Mallory threw her way. They were a team, and right now, that boy needed them both at their best.

## Setting:

The story opens inside the bustling emergency room of St. Jude's Hospital, located in the heart of Millwood, Pennsylvania. Millwood itself is a small, struggling town, nestled amongst the rolling hills of the Pocono Mountains. Once a thriving industrial hub, its factories had long since closed, leaving behind a landscape of abandoned buildings and a population struggling to make ends meet. St. Jude's, a relatively small hospital with limited resources, served as the town's lifeline, a beacon of hope in a community grappling with poverty, addiction, and a pervasive sense of despair. The ER, perpetually understaffed and overcrowded, reflected the town's struggles. The walls were scuffed and stained, the equipment often outdated, and the air thick with the smells of disinfectant, fear, and regret. Despite its shortcomings, however, St. Jude's was also a place of genuine compassion, staffed by dedicated individuals like Abbey Rosewater who were fiercely committed to providing the best possible care for their community.
