Okay, here's a story opening with setting and character details:

**Setting:** The biting wind whipped snow across the frozen fields of Havenwood County, Montana. The sun, a weak, watery disc, barely pierced the thick, gray clouds hanging heavy over the jagged peaks of the Crazy Mountains. The only spots of color were the brightly painted, though peeling, signs proclaiming "Hank's Feed & Seed" and the faded red barn of the Havenwood Veterinary Clinic.

**Opening:**

Dr. Eleanor Grace McMillan squinted, pressing her gloved hands against the icy steering wheel of her ancient, mud-splattered Jeep Cherokee. The snow tires, bless their grizzled souls, were doing their best against the slick roads, but the wind threatened to shove her right into the ditch. She was already running late, a habit Mrs. Gable, the owner of a prize-winning Angus bull named "Bartholomew," was unlikely to forgive. Eleanor sighed, her breath fogging the windshield. Bartholomew was notorious for his temper, and Mrs. Gable was equally infamous for herâ€¦ well, *spirited* nature. This promised to be a long, cold morning, and Eleanor hadn't even finished her first cup of coffee.
