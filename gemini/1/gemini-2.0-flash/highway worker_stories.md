The humid August air hung thick and heavy, a tangible blanket woven with exhaust fumes and the scent of melting asphalt. Earl Raymond Peterson wiped the sweat from his brow with a dirt-stained rag, leaving a dark smudge that only made him look more weary. The sun, a merciless bully in the clear blue sky, beat down on the endless stretch of Interstate 95 just north of Jacksonville, Florida. The heat shimmered off the blacktop, blurring the already monotonous landscape of scrub pine and palmetto trees.

He was patching a particularly nasty pothole, the jackhammer rattling in his hands and vibrating up his arms until his teeth ached. It was a thankless job, but it paid the bills, fed his family, and kept the arteries of the state flowing. He glanced at the digital sign flashing above the highway: "SLOW. ROAD WORK AHEAD." A small comfort, knowing he was at least giving drivers a warning. Today, however, felt different. There was a stillness in the air, a strange quiet that even the relentless drone of traffic couldn't quite dispel. Something felt like it was about to happen.
