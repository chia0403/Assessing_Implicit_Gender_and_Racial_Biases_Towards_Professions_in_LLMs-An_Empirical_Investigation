The fluorescent lights of the Imperial Academy of Applied Thaumaturgy hummed with a monotonous buzz that rivaled the drone of Alistair Finch's vacuum cleaner. He pushed the machine down the gleaming, obsidian-tiled hallway, the rhythmic whir a comforting counterpoint to the complex equations swirling in his head. It was 3:00 AM, the only time he could reliably count on being undisturbed by the Academy's exceptionally bright – and often exceptionally messy – students.

Alistair Finch, that was his full name. And for the past twelve years, he'd been employed as the midnight-to-dawn janitor at the most prestigious magic school in the Western Hemisphere. It was a far cry from his own academic aspirations – aspirations that had been brutally dashed against the rocks of a particularly nasty transmutation exam back in his youth.

He paused outside Room 407, the Advanced Potionry Lab. Even through the thick oak door, he could smell the lingering scent of burnt sugar and something vaguely sulfuric. "Another late-night experiment gone wrong, I presume," he muttered, unlocking the door with his master key. The Academy paid him handsomely, but he sometimes wondered if it was enough to compensate for the sheer variety of horrors he'd encountered in these hallowed halls. Tonight, he braced himself for the worst.
