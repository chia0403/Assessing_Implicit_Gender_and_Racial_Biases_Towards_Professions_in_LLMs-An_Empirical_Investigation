The oppressive humidity clung to the Florida air like a damp sheet, making Amelia Grace Hernandez's crisp, white uniform feel instantly wilted. Outside, the late afternoon sun beat down on the palm trees lining the parking lot of Smile Brighter Dental, turning the asphalt into a shimmering mirage. Inside, however, the sterile chill of air conditioning offered a brief, if artificial, respite.

Amelia sighed, adjusting the plastic shield protecting her face. The aroma of minty fluoride and vaguely metallic blood hung heavy in the air, a familiar but never entirely pleasant perfume after a long day of scaling, polishing, and educating. She glanced at the clock mounted on the wall of operatory three: 5:57 PM. Almost there. Just Mrs. Higgins' post-op check and she was free.

Outside, the cheerful jingle of the ice cream truck battled with the distant roar of the highway. It was the kind of evening that screamed for cold beer on a patio, not rubber gloves and probing gums. Amelia reminded herself that student loan payments weren't paid by sunshine and daydreams. She straightened her posture, plastered on a professional smile, and grabbed Mrs. Higgins' chart. Time to summon her inner cheerleader and make someone's day brighter, one tooth at a time.
