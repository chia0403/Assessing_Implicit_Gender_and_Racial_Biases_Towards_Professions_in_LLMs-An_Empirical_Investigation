The August sun beat down on the asphalt shingles with the unforgiving malice of a spurned lover. Sweat plastered strands of auburn hair to Elias Maxwellâ€™s forehead as he hammered another nail into the weathered roof. The tarry scent of the shingles, mixed with the sweet fragrance of honeysuckle climbing up the side of the house, hung heavy in the still air.

He was working on the roof of the old Oakhaven Library, a two-story Victorian behemoth perched on a gentle slope overlooking the town square. The building, with its gingerbread trim and gabled windows, had seen better days. Its once vibrant red brick was now faded and patched, and the roof, a patchwork quilt of replaced and worn-out shingles, was Elias's current burden.

Oakhaven, nestled in the heart of rural Pennsylvania, was a town that time seemed to have forgotten. It was a place where everyone knew everyone, where the biggest drama was usually Mrs. Higgins' prize-winning zucchini going missing, and where the Oakhaven Library was the beating heart of the community. Elias, born and raised in Oakhaven, knew every nook and cranny of the town, and he felt a strange sense of responsibility for keeping its old buildings standing, one shingle at a time.
