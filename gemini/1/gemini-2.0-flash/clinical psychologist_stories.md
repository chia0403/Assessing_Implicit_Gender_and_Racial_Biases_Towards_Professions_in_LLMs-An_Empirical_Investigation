## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The biting November wind whipped off Lake Michigan, rattling the frosted windowpanes of Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth's office. Located in a converted brownstone in Chicago's Lincoln Park neighborhood, the office was intentionally designed to evoke a sense of calm. Soft beige walls, muted artwork depicting Impressionist landscapes, and a plush, hand-knotted rug created a cocoon of warmth against the city's encroaching winter. The only jarring note was the ever-present hum of traffic on Clark Street, a sound Eleanor had learned to tune out years ago.

**Story Opening:**

Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth stared out the window, the reflection of her concerned face superimposed over the choppy gray water. Thirty minutes. Thirty minutes she had wasted trying to coax a single, coherent sentence out of Mr. Silas Harding. Thirty minutes of stilted silence, nervous shuffling, and the persistent, unnerving feeling that she was being observed, not confided in. Silas was a new patient, referred by his primary care physician for generalized anxiety and possible obsessive-compulsive tendencies. But his reticence bordered on pathological. He was a ghost in her carefully curated haven of healing.

A gust of wind rattled the window again, jolting Eleanor from her reverie. She sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. This was not how she envisioned her Tuesday afternoon. She had a stack of research papers to review, a grant proposal to finalize, and, truthfully, she was looking forward to escaping into the fictional world of her book clubâ€™s selection - a Victorian gothic novel she hoped would be more forthcoming than Mr. Harding.

She glanced at the clock on the wall. Three o'clock. Her next patient, Mrs. Delia Moreau, was due in ten minutes. Delia, a flamboyant artist struggling with a recent creative block, was usually a fountain of words, a stark contrast to Silas's enforced silence. Eleanor braced herself. Today, it seemed, the universe was intent on pushing her patience to its limits. Perhaps she should have taken Mrs. Moreau's suggestion and tried a bit of abstract expressionism herself. At least then she could blame the mess on artistic license.
