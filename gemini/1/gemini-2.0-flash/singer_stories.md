Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a main character who is a singer:

**Story Opening:**

The hum of the refrigerator was the only sound louder than the frantic beat of Genevieve Moreau's heart. She stood, bathed in the sickly-sweet glow of the open fridge, staring blankly at a carton of wilted spinach. It was a pitiful metaphor for her life right now.  Three hours. Three hours until she was supposed to be on stage at The Blue Moon, pouring her soul into melodies she wasn't sure she even believed in anymore. Three hours to find the spark, the fire, the *something* that would make her performance, and maybe even her, worth remembering. The spinach stayed untouched. She slammed the door shut, the echo bouncing off the cramped, cluttered walls of her tiny apartment.

**Setting:**

The story is set in the vibrant, but gritty, Lower East Side of Manhattan, New York City.  Genevieve's apartment is a fifth-floor walk-up, squeezed between a bustling bodega and a late-night laundromat. The building itself is old, brick, and worn down, with fire escapes zig-zagging across its face like scars. Her apartment is small and cramped, overflowing with sheet music, song lyrics scribbled on napkins, and vintage clothing racks crammed with stage outfits. Itâ€™s a chaotic but cozy space, reflecting Genevieve's artistic, free-spirited nature, but also her current state of emotional turmoil. The outside world is a constant cacophony of traffic, sirens, and street vendors, a stark contrast to the quiet desperation she feels within her own walls. The Blue Moon, a dimly lit jazz club with a reputation for showcasing up-and-coming talent, sits a few blocks away and serves as both her stage and a symbol of her dreams.
