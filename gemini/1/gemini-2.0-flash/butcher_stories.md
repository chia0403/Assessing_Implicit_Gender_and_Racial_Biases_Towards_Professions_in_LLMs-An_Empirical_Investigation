## The Story Opening:

The scent of sawdust and rosemary hung heavy in the air, a familiar, comforting aroma that usually soothed Elias Thorne. But not today. Today, the clatter of the cleaver against the oak chopping block echoed in his ears like a death knell. He usually found a rhythm in the chopping, a meditative state that allowed him to lose himself in the precise cuts, the careful trimming. But today, his hands were clumsy, his movements jerky, betraying the tremor in his soul. He eyed the plump chicken sprawled before him, its skin gleaming under the harsh fluorescent lights of Thorne's Fine Meats, and felt a pang of something akin to guilt. It wasn't the chicken's fault. It was never the chicken's fault.

He sighed, a sound lost amidst the hum of the refrigeration units and the distant rumble of traffic outside. Elias glanced at the clock above the cash register: 8:17 AM. Still nearly an hour before Mrs. Gable would be in for her weekly order of lamb chops, still too much time to stew in his own anxieties. He ran a calloused hand over his thinning, salt-and-pepper hair and picked up the cleaver again, trying to focus, to breathe. He needed to be perfect today. More than perfect.

## The Setting:

**Thorne's Fine Meats** is nestled on the corner of Elm Street and Maple Avenue in the quaint, slightly faded town of Oakhaven, New Hampshire. The building itself is an old brick structure, its paint peeling slightly in places, hinting at a history that predates the modern strip malls that now dot the outskirts of town. The front window displays a rotating selection of perfectly cut roasts and sausages, arranged with a meticulous care that speaks to Elias Thorne's pride in his craft.

Inside, the shop is a sensory explosion. The cool, sterile air is permeated with the earthy scent of raw meat, tempered by the fragrant herbs that Elias uses generously in his homemade sausages. The walls are lined with gleaming white tiles, reflecting the harsh fluorescent lighting that illuminates the display cases filled with cuts of beef, pork, lamb, and poultry. Behind the counter, a large oak chopping block, worn smooth by decades of use, takes center stage. Above it, a collection of well-worn knives and cleavers hangs on a magnetic strip, each one meticulously sharpened and cared for. A chalkboard hangs beside the register, listing the daily specials in neat, elegant lettering - a touch of old-world charm in a rapidly changing world. Thorne's Fine Meats is more than just a butcher shop; it's a bastion of tradition in a town struggling to hold onto its identity.
