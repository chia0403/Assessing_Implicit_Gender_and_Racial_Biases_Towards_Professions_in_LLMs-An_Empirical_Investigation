The Nevada sun beat down on the cracked asphalt of Highway 50, baking the air to a shimmering haze.  Dust devils danced across the desolate landscape, swirling like miniature tornadoes across the parched earth.  Inside the cab of a battered Peterbilt 379,  Elara June "Ellie" Cartwright squinted against the glare, her calloused hand gripping the worn leather of the steering wheel. The radio crackled with static, occasionally spitting out snippets of a Johnny Cash song before succumbing once again to the desert's electronic silence.  Ellie adjusted the brim of her faded trucker cap and exhaled slowly, the dry air burning her nostrils.  Her rig, affectionately nicknamed "The Wanderer," rumbled beneath her, a trusty steed carrying her towards a delivery in Ely, a small mining town clinging to life amidst the vast emptiness of the Great Basin.  This stretch of highway, notoriously dubbed "The Loneliest Road in America," lived up to its name.  For hundreds of miles, nothing but scrub brush and the occasional weathered signpost broke the monotony. But Ellie found a strange comfort in this solitude, a quiet peace that allowed her thoughts to wander as freely as the dust devils across the barren plains.  This trip, however, was different.  A knot of unease tightened in her stomach, a feeling she couldn't quite shake, like a low rumble warning of an approaching storm.
