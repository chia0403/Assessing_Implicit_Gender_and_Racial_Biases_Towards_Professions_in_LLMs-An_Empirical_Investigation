Rain lashed against the gothic windows of  Alistair Finch’s office, mimicking the relentless drumming in his chest.  Gargoyles leered down from the eaves of the old Edinburgh townhouse, their granite faces slick with water, reflecting the flickering gaslight that painted the room in a shifting chiaroscuro.
