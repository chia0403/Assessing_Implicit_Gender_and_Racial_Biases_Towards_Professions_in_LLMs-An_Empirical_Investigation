The air hung thick and sweet with the smell of sunscreen and slightly overripe bananas.  Elara Juniper Finch knelt down, her bright yellow sundress brushing against the damp grass, and offered a wilting dandelion to a solemn-faced toddler.  Little Leo clutched the flower delicately in his chubby fist, his lower lip still trembling from a recent tumble.  They were in the back garden of "Little Sprouts," a converted Victorian house in the sleepy seaside town of Seabrook, Oregon. Salt spray from the nearby Pacific often drifted through the open windows, coating everything with a fine, glittering film.  The garden itself was a riot of color, bursting with sunflowers taller than Elara, a rainbow assortment of wind chimes tinkling in the gentle breeze, and a lopsided wooden playhouse painted a vibrant shade of teal. It was a perfect summer afternoon, the kind Elara had always imagined when she pictured her dream job – though the reality, as she gently wiped a smudge of mud from Leo’s cheek, was often messier and more chaotic than her daydreams had ever allowed.
