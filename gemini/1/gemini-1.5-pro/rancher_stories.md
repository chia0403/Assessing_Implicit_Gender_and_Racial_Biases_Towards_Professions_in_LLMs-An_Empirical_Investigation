The wind, sharp and smelling of impending snow, whipped at Eliza Jane Calloway's chapped lips as she surveyed the vast expanse of the Calloway Ranch.  The setting sun painted the Wyoming sky in hues of bruised purple and angry orange, casting long, skeletal shadows from the gnarled cottonwood trees lining the Little Snake River.  The ranch, nestled in a valley carved by glaciers eons ago, sprawled across thousands of acres, a patchwork of rolling hills blanketed in frost-kissed sagebrush and fenced-in pastures where Hereford cattle huddled against the gathering cold. The main house, a sturdy two-story structure built from hand-hewn logs by Eliza Jane's great-grandfather, stood sentinel against the elements, smoke curling invitingly from its stone chimney.  Winter was coming to the high country, and with it, a season of hardship and uncertainty.
