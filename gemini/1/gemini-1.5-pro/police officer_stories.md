The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, carrying icy needles that stung Detective Isabella “Izzy” Diaz’s exposed cheeks.  A sliver of moon hung like a chipped fingernail in the inky Chicago sky, offering little illumination beyond the sodium glow of the streetlights that painted the deserted alleyway a sickly yellow.  Steam billowed from the overflowing dumpster at the far end, the only movement in the otherwise frozen tableau. Izzy, bundled in her thickest parka, stamped her feet against the frozen pavement, the rhythmic crunch the only sound besides the distant wail of a siren.  Her breath plumed white in the frigid air as she surveyed the scene: a single, scarlet pool staining the grimy concrete, reflecting the flashing blue and red lights of the patrol cars parked haphazardly at the alley’s mouth.  This was her city, and tonight, it was bleeding.
