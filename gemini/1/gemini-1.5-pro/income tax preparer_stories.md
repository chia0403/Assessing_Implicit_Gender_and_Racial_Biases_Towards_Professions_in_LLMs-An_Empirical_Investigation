Rain lashed against the window of Amelia Jane Holloway's cramped office, blurring the neon glow of "A.J. Holloway, Tax Preparation" that flickered intermittently in the downpour.  The office, nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed bakery on Bleaker Street in the perpetually grey city of Hollow Creek, was small but fiercely hers.  Filing cabinets overflowed with meticulously organized client folders, each a testament to Amelia's dedication to untangling the Gordian knot of tax law.  A chipped mug depicting a cartoon badger wearing a bowler hat sat precariously on a stack of 1040 forms, lukewarm coffee sloshing with every tremor of the aging building.  The air smelled faintly of printer ink and despair, the usual aroma of tax season. This year, however, there was something else hanging in the air, something unsettling, something... otherworldly.
