Rain lashed against the gothic windows of Dr. Evelyn Reed's Edinburgh flat, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  The worn leather of her favourite armchair offered little comfort. Outside, the city lights blurred into a shimmering, impressionistic painting through the downpour.  Evelyn, her full name Dr. Evelyn Grace Reed, traced the rim of her lukewarm tea, the floral pattern a stark contrast to the grim image seared in her mind: a chalk outline on rain-slicked cobblestones, a single crimson stain blooming beside it like a macabre poppy. The call had come an hour earlier, pulling her from a rare evening of quiet study. A body had been found near Greyfriars Kirkyard, and Detective Inspector Alistair MacIntyre needed her expertise.  This wasn't just another case.  This one felt personal, though Evelyn couldnâ€™t quite place her finger on why. The chill that permeated the air seeped deeper than the dampness of the Scottish night; it settled in her bones, a premonition of something dark and unsettling to come.
