A call about a critical power outage had yanked him from a rare sound sleep, the urgency in the dispatcher's voice hinting at something more serious than a blown transformer. The flickering red warning light on the substation's control panel, barely visible through the swirling snow, confirmed his suspicions. This wasn't going to be a quick fix.
