Rain lashed against the attic window, mimicking the tempest brewing inside Elias Thorne.  He shoved a stray lock of greying brown hair from his eyes and glared at the blinking cursor on his laptop screen.  The attic room, his self-proclaimed "sanctuary," felt less like a refuge and more like a prison cell. Dusty manuscripts piled precariously on every surface, testament to years of half-finished novels and abandoned short stories.  The only illumination came from the laptop's sickly glow and a single bare bulb dangling precariously from the rafters, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to mock his writer's block. Elias, full name Elias Alistair Thorne, a once celebrated author of gothic thrillers, was now trapped in a different kind of nightmare â€“ the terrifying blank page. The old Victorian house in the secluded Cornish village of Trewartha, once his inspiration, now echoed with the silence of his failing muse.  The sea roared in the distance, a constant, ominous reminder of the approaching deadline he was certain he would miss.
