The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the Rusty Mug, a rhythm that matched the relentless pounding in Elias Thorne's temples.  Neon signs advertising long-dead breweries flickered intermittently through the grime-streaked window, casting a sickly glow across the empty bar.  It was 2:17 am, a Tuesday, in the forgotten pocket of Port Blossom, Maine, where the salty tang of the ocean fought a losing battle against the pervasive smell of fish guts and despair.  Elias, his salt-and-pepper hair plastered to his forehead, wiped the sticky mahogany surface with a damp rag, the only sound aside from the downpour being the mournful groan of a loose floorboard beneath his worn leather boots.  He was closing up, or rather, preparing for another day of pretending to be open.  Business hadn't exactly been booming since the cannery closed down, and Elias was starting to think he'd be better off selling bottled seawater to tourists.
