The air in "Shear Perfection," Genevieve Dubois' salon, hung thick with the scent of coconut oil and hairspray, a comforting aroma she'd come to associate with success.  Located on the bustling, palm-lined Delacroix Street in the heart of New Orleans' French Quarter, the salon was a vibrant splash of teal and gold amidst the aged brick and wrought iron balconies.  It was a Tuesday morning, the kind that usually saw a slow trickle of regulars coming in for touch-ups and trims. But today, a strange stillness clung to the normally bustling street outside, punctuated only by the distant, mournful wail of a jazz trumpet.  Genevieve, her fiery red hair piled high in an intricate twist, glanced at the antique clock above the reception desk. 9:57 am.  Three minutes to her first appointment, and Mrs. Moreau, never late in her eighty-two years, was nowhere to be seen.
