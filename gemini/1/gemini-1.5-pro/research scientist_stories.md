The biting Antarctic wind whipped at Dr. Evelyn Ramirez-Ochoa's parka, stinging her exposed cheeks despite the thick layers of thermal protection.  The McMurdo Station weather report had warned of gusts up to 50 knots, but out here, on the precarious edge of the Ross Ice Shelf, it felt closer to hurricane force.  Evelyn braced herself against the railing of the research platform, her gloved hand gripping the icy metal as she gazed down at the churning, inky blackness of the newly formed polynya. This immense, irregular hole in the sea ice, larger than she had ever witnessed, wasn't supposed to be here. Not now. Not in this location.  It was an anomaly, a tear in the fabric of the expected, and it was the reason Evelyn, a leading glaciologist, had flown halfway across the world, leaving behind the relative comfort of her lab in Cambridge. The strange bioluminescent readings emanating from the depths of the polynya, readings defying all known marine biology, were a siren call she couldn't ignore.
