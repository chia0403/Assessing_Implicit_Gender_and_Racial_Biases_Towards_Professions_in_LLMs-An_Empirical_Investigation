The mahogany desk, polished to a mirror sheen, reflected the flickering gaslight illuminating Judge Elias Thorne’s furrowed brow. Rain lashed against the leaded windows of his chambers, a relentless drumming that mirrored the tension knotting his stomach.  It was late November, 1888, and the fog-choked streets of Whitechapel, London, were not only damp with chilling mist, but also with a pervasive fear.  Outside, the cobblestones echoed with the hurried footsteps of those desperate to reach the safety of their homes before darkness fully claimed the city. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of old books and the lingering ghost of pipe tobacco, a stark contrast to the metallic tang of blood that seemed to cling to the very air of Whitechapel these days.  Judge Thorne pushed aside the stack of parchment before him, each document a testament to the escalating brutality plaguing the district – another missing woman, another unsolved crime.  He rubbed his weary eyes, the weight of his position pressing down on him like the heavy velvet drapes that framed the room. He knew, with a certainty that chilled him to the bone, that this night, like so many others recently, would bring no peace to Whitechapel.
