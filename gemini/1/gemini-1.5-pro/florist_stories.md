The bell above the door of "Petal & Stem" tinkled merrily, a counterpoint to the drumming of rain against the large front window. Eliza Jane Hawthorne, her fingers dusted with pollen and smelling faintly of lilies, looked up from the elaborate funeral wreath she was constructing. Outside, the grey cobbled streets of Port Blossom, Oregon, shimmered under the downpour, the normally bustling harbor reduced to a canvas of shifting greys and greens. The salty tang of the Pacific, usually a comforting presence, was today sharpened by the storm, promising a long, wet afternoon. Eliza sighed, a strand of her auburn hair escaping her messy bun.  Funeral wreaths weren't exactly her favorite commissions, but Mrs. Henderson's late husband had adored dahlias, and Eliza was determined to create a tribute worthy of his memory, even if it meant working through her lunch break.
