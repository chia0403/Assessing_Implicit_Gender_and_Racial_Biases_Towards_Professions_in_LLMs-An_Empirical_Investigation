The clatter of pots and pans was Emilia Rossi's morning symphony.  Not the delicate tinkling of cymbals or the mournful wail of a cello, but a robust, percussive clang that echoed through the cramped galley kitchen of the *Salty Siren*.  Dawn painted the porthole a bruised purple, the color of overripe plums, and the air hung thick with the mingled scents of brine, frying onions, and Emilia's signature spice blend â€“ a closely guarded secret she referred to simply as "Magic Dust." The *Salty Siren*, a once-grand fishing trawler now converted into a somewhat ramshackle floating restaurant, bobbed gently against the pier in the sleepy harbor town of Port Blossom, Maine.  Emilia, her dark hair pulled back in a practical bun, surveyed her domain with a critical eye, a smear of flour on her cheek and a wooden spoon tucked behind her ear like a conductor's baton. Today was the first day of the tourist season, and Emilia had a feeling it was going to be a busy one.
