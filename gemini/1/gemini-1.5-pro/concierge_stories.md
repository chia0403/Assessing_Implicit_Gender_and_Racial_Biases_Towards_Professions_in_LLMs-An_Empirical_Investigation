The opulent lobby of the Grand Majestic Hotel shimmered under the weight of a thousand crystal chandeliers.  Rain lashed against the arched windows, blurring the view of the Chicago skyline into a watercolor of greys and blues. Inside, a fire roared in the marble fireplace, casting flickering shadows across the Persian rugs and plush velvet furniture.  This was Genevieve "Gen" Dubois’s domain. As Head Concierge, Gen orchestrated the desires of the hotel’s elite clientele, transforming whimsical requests into tangible realities with a grace and efficiency that bordered on magical. Tonight, however, the air crackled with an unusual tension.  A string quartet played a nervous melody in the corner, and the hushed whispers of the gathered guests spoke of something more than the usual pre-gala jitters.  Gen, impeccably dressed in her signature midnight blue suit, felt a prickle of unease beneath her perfectly composed exterior.  Something was about to happen, she could feel it in the shift of the air, in the strained smiles of the staff.  And she had a feeling it was about to land squarely in her lap.
