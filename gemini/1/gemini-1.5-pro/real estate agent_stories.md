Rain lashed against the stained-glass window of St. Jude's, the rhythmic drumming a counterpoint to the nervous tap-tap-tapping of Amelia Grace Hawthorne's heel against the worn oak floorboards.  The church, nestled amongst the grand Victorian houses of Ashworth Park, usually exuded an air of peaceful solemnity.  Today, however, the storm raging outside mirrored the turmoil churning within Amelia.  She clutched a damp flyer advertising "Ashworth Park's Autumn Auction," her own smiling face beaming unrealistically from the glossy paper.  The auction, her biggest gamble yet, was only two hours away, and the predicted downpour threatened to wash away not just the attendees, but her fledgling career as a real estate agent in the fiercely competitive San Francisco market.  The scent of old hymnals and damp wood filled the air, doing little to calm the fluttering in her stomach.  She needed this auction to be a success.  She needed to prove, not just to the skeptical whispers of the established Ashworth Park agents, but to herself, that she could make it in this world.
