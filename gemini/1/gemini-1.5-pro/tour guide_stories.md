The sun, a molten orange orb, dipped below the jagged peaks of the Dolomites, painting the snow-capped summits in hues of rose and violet.  A crisp alpine breeze, scented with pine and the faintest whisper of woodsmoke, rustled through the larch trees surrounding the Rifugio Lagazuoi, a mountain hut perched precariously on the edge of a sheer cliff face. Inside, the warm glow of kerosene lamps battled against the encroaching twilight.  Eleanor Vance, her breath misting in the cool air, adjusted the strap of her worn leather backpack and surveyed the small group gathered around a crackling fire.  Seven faces, a tapestry of nationalities and ages, looked back at her with a mixture of anticipation and awe.  This was the culmination of their week-long trek through the Italian Alps, a journey Eleanor had curated with meticulous care.  Tonight, under a sky dusted with a million stars, she would share with them the legend of the Lagazuoi tunnels, a chilling reminder of the Great War fought amongst these very peaks.
