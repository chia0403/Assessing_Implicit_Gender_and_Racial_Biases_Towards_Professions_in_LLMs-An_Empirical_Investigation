The scent of woodsmoke from the enormous stone chimney mingled with the crisp, metallic tang of approaching rain, creating a peculiar atmosphere that mirrored Amelia's own unsettled mood. Inside, flickering gas lamps cast long shadows across the ornate, wood-paneled hallways, illuminating stained-glass windows depicting scenes of pastoral tranquility that felt jarringly at odds with the tension brewing within the manorâ€™s walls.  Something was different this morning, a subtle shift in the air, a quiet hum of unease that Amelia couldn't quite place.
