The insistent London drizzle, a fine mist that clung to everything like a second skin, hadn't deterred the usual Friday evening throngs in Shoreditch. Neon signs buzzed to life, reflecting in the slick, black pavement, casting an oily rainbow sheen across Amelia "Millie" Cartwright's worn Doc Martens.  Millie, her laptop bag slung across her shoulder, navigated the crowd with practiced ease, the scent of street food – a heady mix of frying onions and spiced samosas – battling with the damp, earthy smell of the nearby park. Her destination was "The Rusty Pixel," a dimly lit, slightly sticky-floored pub that had become the unofficial Friday night hub for London's freelance graphic design community. Tonight, however, Millie wasn't there for the usual camaraderie and complaints about demanding clients.  She clutched a rolled-up poster in her free hand, her heart hammering against her ribs, a mixture of trepidation and fierce determination swirling within her. This poster, the culmination of weeks of sleepless nights and obsessive tweaking, held the key to her future.
