The biting November wind whipped around Cassandra "Cassie" Bellweather's ankles as she unlocked the door to "Curl Up & Dye," her salon nestled between a perpetually closed antique shop and a bustling bakery that smelled eternally of cinnamon and burnt sugar.  The frosty air, scented with woodsmoke and impending snow, infiltrated the small space, chasing away the lingering warmth from the space heater Cassie had left running overnight.  Curl Up & Dye wasn't glamorous. It consisted of two worn styling chairs, a chipped porcelain sink, and a wall crammed with shelves overflowing with brightly coloured dyes and styling products. But it was Cassie's, every scuff mark and faded floral wallpaper strip a testament to her five years of hard work and dedication in the small, gossipy town of Harmony Creek, nestled deep in the Appalachian foothills.  This morning, however, the usual cozy familiarity of her salon felt different.  An unsettling stillness hung in the air, heavier than the usual Tuesday morning quiet, and a faint, metallic scent, not quite blood but something akin to it, clung to the back of her throat.
