The late October wind whipped fallen maple leaves into frenzied dances across the cracked asphalt of the St. Jude's School parking lot. Amelia Rose Hawthorne, her bright red scarf a defiant splash of colour against the grey afternoon, shivered and pulled her wool coat tighter. The air smelled of woodsmoke and the faint, lingering sweetness of decaying pumpkins left over from the school's Halloween festivities.  St. Jude's, a small, brick building nestled amongst the towering pines of rural Vermont, held a special kind of quiet in the late afternoon. Most of the students had already been bundled onto the yellow buses that coughed and sputtered their way down the long driveway, leaving only the hushed echoes of the day behind. Inside, the fluorescent lights hummed a low, steady song, illuminating empty classrooms filled with the ghosts of childish laughter and the lingering scent of crayons.  Amelia, however, wasn't ready to leave.  A stack of ungraded papers sat heavy on her desk, and a nagging worry about one of her students, a quiet boy named Samuel, kept her rooted to the spot.
