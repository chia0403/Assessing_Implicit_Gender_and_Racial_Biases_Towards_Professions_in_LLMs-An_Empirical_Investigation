The salt-laced wind whipped at Amelia Reyesâ€™s black coat, tugging strands of her dark hair free from the loose bun at the nape of her neck.  The Isle of Skye, in all its brooding, majestic glory, stretched out before her.  Jagged peaks, shrouded in mist that swirled like phantom dancers, pierced the bruised twilight sky.  Below, the ocean churned against the basalt cliffs, a restless, foaming beast that gnawed at the edges of the world. Amelia, perched precariously on a windswept outcrop overlooking the Old Man of Storr, adjusted the tripod that supported her vintage Hasselblad camera.  The air was thick with the scent of brine and peat, and a raw, untamed energy pulsed through the landscape, mirroring the anticipation humming in her own veins. This wasn't just another photograph; this was the shot.  The one that would capture the raw, elemental power of Skye, the one that would finally make her name.
