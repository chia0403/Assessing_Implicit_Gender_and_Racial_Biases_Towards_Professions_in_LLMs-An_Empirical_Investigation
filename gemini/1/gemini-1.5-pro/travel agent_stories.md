The insistent chirping of a gecko, hidden somewhere amidst the overflowing philodendrons, was the only sound that punctuated the humid stillness of the "Paradise Found" travel agency. Elara Vivienne Holloway, her name as elegant and evocative as the destinations she curated for her clients, sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. The agency, nestled in a vibrant, if slightly ramshackle, corner of Old San Juan, Puerto Rico, was a riot of colour. Brochures promising turquoise waters and white sand beaches spilled from wicker baskets, posters of snow-capped mountains and bustling European cities plastered the walls, and a faint scent of coconut oil mingled with the salty tang of the nearby ocean.  Outside, the cobblestone streets shimmered under the midday sun, the air thick with the promise of a tropical downpour. Elara, however, was focused on the flickering screen of her ancient computer, a frown etched between her perfectly shaped brows.  Paradise, it seemed, was proving rather elusive this afternoon.
