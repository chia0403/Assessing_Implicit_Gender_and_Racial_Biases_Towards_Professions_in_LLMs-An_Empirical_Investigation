The pre-dawn sky over Miami was a bruised purple, bleeding into streaks of hesitant orange.  A humid breeze, thick with the scent of saltwater and plumeria, ruffled Amelia “Amy” Reyes’s perfectly coiffed bun as she navigated the near-empty employee parking lot at Miami International Airport. Her rolling suitcase, emblazoned with a faded sticker from a layover in Reykjavik, clattered over the cracked asphalt, echoing the hollow ache in her stomach. This was Amy’s third red-eye in a week, and the relentless cycle of time zones and turbulent passenger interactions was beginning to wear her down. Today's flight, Oceanic Air 816, a direct service to Tokyo Narita, promised a full cabin and an even longer stretch of enforced cheerfulness. Amy sighed, tucking a stray strand of dark hair behind her ear and straightening her crisp navy uniform jacket. The vast, humming terminal loomed before her, a beacon of fluorescent light in the pre-dawn gloom, promising another long day in the sky.
