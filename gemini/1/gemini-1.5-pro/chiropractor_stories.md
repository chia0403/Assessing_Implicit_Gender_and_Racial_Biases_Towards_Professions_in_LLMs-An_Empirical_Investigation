The neon "Open" sign buzzed erratically, casting a sickly green glow over the rain-slicked asphalt of Elm Street. Inside, Dr. Elias Thorne, D.C., adjusted the stiff collar of his white coat, the starch crackling in the oppressive silence of his waiting room.  Rain hammered against the large bay window showcasing a framed anatomical chart of the human spine, its vibrant colours muted by the encroaching twilight. Thorne Chiropractic, established 1988, proclaimed a small, gold-leafed plaque beneath it.  The town of Havenwood, Oregon, had seen better days, and Thorne Chiropractic, nestled between a boarded-up diner and a struggling secondhand bookstore, reflected that decline. Elias traced the outline of a wilting peace lily with a finger, a nervous habit he'd picked up recently.  The clock ticked loudly, each second a hammer blow against the quiet anticipation of somethingâ€¦ unsettling.
