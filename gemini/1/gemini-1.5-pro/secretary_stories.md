The relentless clack of the typewriter keys punctuated the otherwise silent office. Rain lashed against the Art Deco windows of the Chrysler Building, a rhythmic counterpoint to the steady typing of Beatrice Eleanor Cartwright.  It was 1937, and the city below, usually a symphony of car horns and chattering pedestrians, was subdued by the downpour. Beatrice, her dark hair pulled back in a severe bun, barely registered the storm. Her focus was entirely on the document in front of her, a complex legal brief for Mr. Henderson, the senior partner at Rothstein, Goldberg & Stern.

A single green banker’s lamp illuminated her small, meticulously organized desk, a stark island in the cavernous, mahogany-paneled room. Outside, the spire of the Chrysler Building, a gleaming needle piercing the grey sky, seemed to watch over her, a silent witness to her dedication, and perhaps, her quiet desperation.
