The aroma of cardamom and browning butter swirled around Elara Thistlewick, clinging to her apron like a second skin.  Dawn painted the cobbled streets of Oakhaven a dusky rose, the only other light emanating from the warm glow of Thistlewick Bakery’s front windows.  Situated on the corner of Whispering Willow Lane and Acorn Avenue, the bakery was a snug, two-story building with crooked eaves and window boxes overflowing with fragrant lavender and rosemary.  Inside, the air hummed with the quiet rhythm of Elara’s work: the gentle thud of dough against the floured wooden table, the rhythmic whir of the ancient mixer, the soft hiss of the oven as it breathed life into her creations.  This morning, however, a different kind of energy crackled in the air, a subtle unease that prickled at the edges of Elara's usually serene focus.  The annual Oakhaven Autumn Festival was only a week away, and while the thought of the bustling crowds and the sweet smell of competition usually thrilled her, this year, a shadow hung over the festivities.
