The stale air of the District Court building clung to Beatrice “Bea” Rodriguez like a second skin.  Fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune above, casting a sickly yellow glow over the chipped linoleum floor and scuffed wooden benches. It was a Tuesday morning in late October in Bellingham, Washington, the kind where the damp chill seeped into your bones and the sky hung low and grey, promising rain. Bea, her dark hair pulled back in a tight bun and a thermos of lukewarm coffee clutched in her hand, sat perched on the edge of a hard bench outside courtroom 4B, flipping through a thick file. The name scrawled across the manila folder in bold black marker:  Marcus “The Hammer” Hamilton. Bea sighed, a puff of white escaping her lips in the frigid air. Hamilton, a repeat offender with a penchant for grand theft auto and a charmingly disarming smile, was due for his probation check-in, and if her instincts were right (and they usually were), he wasn’t going to show. The salty tang of the nearby Puget Sound, usually a comforting presence, felt oppressive today, mirroring the knot of apprehension tightening in Bea’s stomach.  This wasn't just another Tuesday; something felt different, wrong.
