The relentless Miami sun beat down on Ocean Drive, turning the turquoise water into a shimmering mirage.  Inside the art deco-styled Solara Fitness, the air thrummed with a bass-heavy remix of a Latin pop song.  Sweat slicked the polished wooden floor, reflecting the kaleidoscope of neon lights that pulsed in time with the music.  Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez, clad in a vibrant coral sports bra and matching leggings, surveyed her Zumba class with a hawk-eye, her dark ponytail whipping around as she demonstrated a particularly complex salsa step.  Outside, palm trees swayed languidly in the breeze, oblivious to the energetic chaos unfolding within the studio's mirrored walls. This was Amy's domain, her sanctuary, the place where she transformed the anxieties and insecurities of Miami's elite into rhythmic, calorie-torching surrender.  Today, however, a different kind of energy crackled in the air, a tension Amy couldn't quite place.  It was subtle, like a faint discordant note in a catchy tune, and it made the fine hairs on the back of her neck prickle with unease.
