The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of Nevada, rattling the corrugated iron shack that served as both KODK’s broadcasting studio and Elias Vance’s home.  Inside, amidst the comforting hum of vacuum tubes and the crackling static of a distant thunderstorm, Elias hunched over a workbench littered with resistors, capacitors, and coils.  A soldering iron, clutched in his calloused hand, trembled slightly as he meticulously connected a wire thinner than a human hair.  The faint scent of burnt rosin hung in the air, mingling with the stale aroma of instant coffee and the lingering dust of a thousand desert storms. KODK, the only radio station for a hundred miles in any direction, was scheduled to go live with the morning news in precisely two hours, and Elias, its sole technician, broadcaster, and janitor, was battling a particularly stubborn signal interference that threatened to plunge his listeners into a world of static. The clock ticked relentlessly on the wall, each click a stark reminder of the dwindling time and the vast emptiness pressing in from beyond the flimsy walls of the shack.
