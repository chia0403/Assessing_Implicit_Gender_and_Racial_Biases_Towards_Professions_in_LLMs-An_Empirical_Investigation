The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the Rusty Anchor, a din that even the Friday night crowd couldn't quite drown out.  Inside, the air hung thick with the mingled scents of frying fish, stale beer, and desperation.  Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the worn linoleum floor and the mismatched tables.  Elena Rodriguez, her name tag slightly askew on her faded black polo shirt, wiped the sweat from her brow with the back of her hand, a weary sigh escaping her lips.  Table six needed refills, table four was arguing about the bill, and the cook was yelling for more tartar sauce.  It was only 8 pm, and Elena already felt like sheâ€™d been working for twelve hours. The Rusty Anchor, perched precariously on the edge of the Salton Sea, wasn't exactly a glamorous establishment, but it was her establishment, at least for the next eight hours. And tonight, she had a feeling, was going to be a long one.
