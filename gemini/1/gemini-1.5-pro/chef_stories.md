The biting November wind whipped off the slate-grey waters of Puget Sound, rattling the windows of The Salty Spoon Diner.  Inside, the air hung thick with the aroma of frying onions and brewing coffee, a comforting bulwark against the chill.

The worn red vinyl booths, each with its own unique constellation of rips and tears, were plumped and inviting. A string of fairy lights twinkled around the faded portrait of a grizzled fisherman that hung above the cash register, adding a touch of whimsicality to the otherwise utilitarian décor.  Esme, her dark hair pulled back in a practical bun, adjusted the faded bandana tied around her forehead, a splash of crimson against the stark white of her chef's coat.  This was her kingdom, a haven of comfort food and salty air, perched precariously on the edge of the world.  Today, however, the usual hum of anticipation before the lunch rush was replaced by a knot of anxiety in Esme’s stomach. Today, a food critic from Seattle was coming.
