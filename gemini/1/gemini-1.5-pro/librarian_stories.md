Dawn painted the stained-glass window above the entrance in hues of rose and gold, casting kaleidoscopic patterns across the silent reading room.  Whispering Pines, nestled deep in the Appalachian Mountains, was a town steeped in folklore and shadowed by ancient forests, a place where the veil between reality and myth felt remarkably thin.  This morning, however, the only mystery Eleanor anticipated was the whereabouts of the overdue copy of "A History of Local Hauntings," checked out three months prior by a reclusive patron known only as Old Man Hemlock.
