The flickering fluorescent lights of the Quick Stop buzzed like trapped insects, casting a sickly yellow glow over the aisles of dusty chips and lukewarm soda. Rain lashed against the single window, the rhythmic drumming a monotonous counterpoint to the tinny jangle of Evelyn Reed's nametag as she scanned a customer's six-pack of generic beer. Outside, the neon sign advertising "24 Hour Service" sputtered intermittently, mirroring the flickering hope in Evelyn's own chest. It was 3:17 am in the desolate town of Harmony Creek, population 842 (and dwindling), and Evelyn was certain she was the only person awake for miles, aside from the shifty-eyed trucker currently counting out his change in greasy nickels and dimes. Harmony Creek, a name ironically at odds with the pervasive air of quiet desperation, had seen better days.  The once-bustling highway that ran through its heart now carried only the occasional long-haul truck or lost tourist, each one a fleeting reminder of a prosperity that had long since faded.  The air hung heavy with the smell of stale coffee and impending disappointment, a fitting backdrop to Evelynâ€™s own stagnant existence.
