It was a tedious job, requiring intense concentration and a meticulous eye for detail, but it was hers.  For the past five years, Amelia had been a vital cog in the D&M machine, translating the grand visions of the architects into the concrete reality of blueprints.  She wasn't one to dream of soaring skyscrapers or innovative designs; her satisfaction lay in the precision of her work, the clean lines, the perfect angles, the tangible evidence of her skill brought to life on paper.  Tonight, however, the usual hum of the drafting room felt different, charged with an almost palpable tension. Something was brewing, Amelia could feel it in the hushed whispers, the furtive glances, the uneasy silence that had fallen over the usually boisterous office.
