The rusty bell above the door of "Shear Delights" jingled merrily, a counterpoint to the low rumble of thunder echoing through the narrow streets of Port Blossom. Rain lashed against the large front window, blurring the view of the bustling harbour just a block away. Inside, Amelia "Amy" Clementine Finch, her auburn hair pulled back in a practical bun, surveyed her domain.  Scissors gleamed under the warm glow of the Edison bulbs she'd painstakingly hung from the exposed brick ceiling.  The scent of coconut shampoo and sandalwood aftershave mingled in the air, a comforting aroma against the stormy backdrop. Amy wiped down the barber chair, its worn leather whispering of countless stories shared within these four walls.  This evening, however, the only other occupant was Barnaby, her ginger tabby cat, curled asleep in a wicker basket beneath a vintage poster advertising "The Worldâ€™s Greatest Shave."  The quiet, punctuated only by the rhythmic drumming of rain, was unusual for a Friday night. Amy hoped the storm wouldn't deter her last client, a new customer with a rather intriguing appointment request.
