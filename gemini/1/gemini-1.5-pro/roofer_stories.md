The tar hissed and bubbled under the August sun, the smell thick and pungent, sticking to Elias Thorne like a second skin. He knelt on the scalding shingles of Mrs. Hemlock's Victorian, the slate-grey roof sloping precariously towards the manicured lawns of Willow Creek. Below him, the affluent town shimmered in the heat haze, a patchwork of emerald green and terracotta rooftops, all neatly arranged against the backdrop of the brooding Catskill Mountains.  Elias wiped the sweat stinging his eyes with a calloused thumb, the grit of asphalt clinging to his skin.  A crow cawed overhead, a mocking sound that echoed the anxiety churning in his gut.  This wasnâ€™t just any roofing job; this was Mrs. Hemlock's house, the grandest in Willow Creek, and Elias, with his worn tool belt and patched-up work boots, felt profoundly out of place. He had a secret, a gnawing suspicion that this job, this town, held something more than just a paycheck.
