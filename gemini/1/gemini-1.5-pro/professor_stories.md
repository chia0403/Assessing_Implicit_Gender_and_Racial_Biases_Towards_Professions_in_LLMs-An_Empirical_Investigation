The biting wind whipped around Professor Alistair Finch, tugging at the edges of his tweed jacket as he hurried across the cobbled quadrangle of St. Jude’s College, Oxford.  Gargoyles leered down from the honey-coloured stone, their grotesque features softened by a dusting of snow.  A thin layer of ice crackled under his worn leather shoes, and the skeletal branches of the ancient oak in the centre of the quad rattled like dry bones.  The air, crisp and cold, smelled of woodsmoke and impending winter.  Alistair clutched a worn copy of Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales closer to his chest, the brittle pages rustling in the wind.  It was late December, and the usual throng of students had dispersed for the holidays, leaving an unusual quietude hanging over the normally bustling college.  This quiet, however, was precisely what Alistair sought.  He was on his way to the library, a sanctuary he often found solace in, especially when the weight of the world, or in this case, a particularly perplexing medieval riddle, pressed down upon him.
