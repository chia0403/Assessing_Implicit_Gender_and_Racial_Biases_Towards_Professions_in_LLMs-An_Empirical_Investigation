The chipped paint on the windowsill of Dr. Eleanor Vance’s office perfectly mirrored the crumbling facade of Ashwood High.  October in the Catskills brought a damp chill that seeped through the old stone walls, clinging to the worn linoleum floors. Outside, the wind rustled the turning leaves of the ancient maples that surrounded the school, their fiery hues a stark contrast to the grey sky.  Eleanor, her dark hair pulled back in a loose bun, watched a lone student shuffle across the muddy quad, head down against the biting wind.  It was a Friday, a day most students eagerly anticipated, but the air at Ashwood always held a particular heaviness, a palpable sense of unease that clung to Eleanor like the damp chill.  This year, it felt worse than usual.  There had been a series of incidents—vandalism, fights, a disturbing rash of absences—and an undercurrent of anxiety thrummed beneath the surface of the school’s routine.  Eleanor took a sip of her lukewarm tea, the metallic tang a grim reminder that she’d forgotten to clean her travel mug.  Today, she was meeting with a new student, transferred from a juvenile detention center downstate. His file, thick with red flags, sat on her desk, the name printed in bold black ink:  Samuel "Sammy" Hayes.
