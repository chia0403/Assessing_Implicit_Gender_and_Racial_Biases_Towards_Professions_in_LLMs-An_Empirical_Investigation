The biting Alaskan wind whipped at Amelia "Ace" Moreau's parka as she prepped her De Havilland Beaver, the "Arctic Fox," for takeoff.  Glacier-carved peaks, shrouded in a pre-dawn twilight, loomed around the small, frozen airstrip nestled beside the churning, steel-grey waters of Cook Inlet.  A thin layer of frost clung to the wings of the bush plane, shimmering like a dusting of diamonds under the weak winter sun struggling to breach the horizon.  Amelia, her breath clouding the frigid air, checked the fuel lines one last time, the scent of aviation fuel mingling with the crisp, pine-scented air. This was her domain, a vast, unforgiving wilderness hundreds of miles from civilization, and today's flight, a supply run to a remote geological survey camp, promised to be anything but routine. The radio crackled to life, a gruff voice breaking the silence: "Arctic Fox, this is Anchorage Control. You're cleared for takeoff.  Be advised, visibility is dropping and we're expecting snow within the hour."  Amelia grinned, a flash of white against the ruddy glow of the rising sun. "Roger that, Anchorage. Arctic Fox, rolling." The engine sputtered, then roared to life, shaking the small plane as it began to taxi down the icy runway.
