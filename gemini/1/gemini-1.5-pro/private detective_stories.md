Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of Benny's Diner, a rhythm as relentless as a judge's gavel. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and frying onions, a greasy blanket against the chill November air that seeped in every time the door swung open. Amelia "Amy" Josephine Lancaster, her trench coat still dripping onto the checkered linoleum floor, sat hunched over a chipped mug, its contents long cold.  Across from her, a man with a face like a crumpled napkin nervously twisted a fedora in his hands. His name was Sal Demarco, and the desperation radiating from him was as palpable as the steam rising from the coffee pot behind the counter.  Amy, private investigator, had seen enough desperate men in her time to know this wasn't a simple missing cat case. The neon glow of the "Benny's" sign cast long, distorted shadows across the rain-slicked street outside, reflecting the unease that settled heavy in Amy's gut.  This was Los Angeles, 1947, a city of angels with a devil lurking in every alleyway, and tonight, the devil was calling collect.
