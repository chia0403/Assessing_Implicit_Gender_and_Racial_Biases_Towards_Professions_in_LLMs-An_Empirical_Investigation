The clatter of horse-drawn carriages on cobblestones echoed up to the attic workroom, a counterpoint to the rhythmic whir of Elias Thorne's treadle sewing machine. Dust motes danced in the shafts of pale November sunlight that slanted through the grimy windowpanes, illuminating the cramped space. Elias, his spectacles perched precariously on his nose, meticulously guided a length of emerald green silk beneath the needle.  His workshop, tucked away in the eaves of a building on Grimshaw Lane, in the perpetually fog-kissed city of New Birmingham, was a chaotic haven. Bolts of fabric in every imaginable colour and texture overflowed from shelves, spilling onto the floor in a vibrant, if somewhat hazardous, tide.  Sketches of gowns, adorned with intricate lace and beadwork designs, pinned to a corkboard, hinted at the artistry contained within this cluttered sanctuary. Outside, the gas lamps were just beginning to flicker to life, casting a warm, hazy glow over the bustling industrial metropolis, a stark contrast to the quiet focus within Elias's attic domain.
