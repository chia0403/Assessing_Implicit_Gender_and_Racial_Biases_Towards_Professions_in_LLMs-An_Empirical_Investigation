The biting wind whipped snow against Captain Amelia “Mia” Rodriguez’s face as she stared up at the five-story brownstone, its windows glowing ominously orange. The fire escape, a twisted metal skeleton clinging precariously to the building's side, was engulfed in flames.  Flakes of ash, like morbid confetti, danced in the swirling vortex of heat and smoke above. Below, on Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village, the chaos was a symphony of flashing lights, screaming sirens, and the guttural roar of the fire engines. Christmas lights, still strung across the street from a week ago, blinked pathetically against the backdrop of the inferno.  The air, thick with the acrid scent of burning wood and melting plastic, crackled with an almost palpable tension. Mia, her helmet already strapped on, could feel the heat through the thick layers of her turnout gear. This wasn't just a fire; it was a beast, hungry and growing, and tonight, it was her job to tame it.
