The biting November wind whipped around Eleanor Vance as she wrestled a massive ficus tree through the double doors of the Fitzwilliam townhouse.  Brownstone stoops lined the street, their wrought iron railings frosted with a delicate layer of ice.  Fallen leaves, the color of burnt umber and ochre, swirled around her ankles.  This particular stretch of Manhattan’s Upper East Side, nestled between Park and Lexington Avenues, exuded an air of quiet, old money – the kind that didn’t need to shout about its Tiffany’s heritage.  Inside, the foyer of number 14 glowed with a warm, inviting light, a stark contrast to the grey afternoon outside.  Eleanor, her breath puffing out in small white clouds,  maneuvered the ficus past a marble-topped console table and into the grand salon, its parquet floor gleaming under the crystal chandelier. This was it, the culmination of months of painstaking planning, sourcing, and agonizing over fabric swatches.  The Fitzwilliam residence, a project that could make or break her fledgling interior design career.
