The flickering fluorescent lights of "Shear Genius," a salon tucked away on a side street in the bustling city of Zenith, hummed a constant, low thrum.  Dust motes danced in the faint shafts of afternoon sun slicing through the grime-streaked windows.  Behind the frosted glass partition of the back room, where the aroma of lavender and ozone hung heavy, sat Amelia "Ames" Nightingale, her brow furrowed in concentration.  A delicate, almost ethereal beauty, with honey-colored hair pulled back in a tight bun, she wielded a precise pair of scissors, meticulously snipping a strand of crimson hair.  The client, a young woman named Elara, with eyes the color of stormy seas, sat patiently, her thoughts lost somewhere beyond the sterile, pastel walls of the salon.  This wasn't just another haircut for Ames.  This was a piece of a puzzle she was determined to solve.
