The biting November wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks.  Rain, slick and persistent, hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the abandoned farmhouse, a mournful counterpoint to the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of her own heart.  Amelia, a seasoned real estate agent with a reputation for turning fixer-uppers into family homes, found herself oddly unnerved.  This wasn't just another dilapidated property; this place exuded a palpable sense of… something else.  Something unsettling.

The setting was the rural outskirts of Blackwood County, a sprawling expanse of rolling hills and whispering pines.  The faded grandeur of the Victorian farmhouse, nestled deep within the woods, was a stark contrast to the modern, well-maintained homes dotting the surrounding streets.  Amelia, her breath fogging in the chilly air, traced a finger along the cracked paint of the porch railing, a silent promise to herself to find the source of the unsettling feeling clinging to the place. She wasn't one to be easily spooked, but the house seemed to hum with a subtle energy she couldn't quite place.  A single, flickering streetlight cast long, dancing shadows that seemed to writhe and twist with every gust of wind.  Inside, the house remained stubbornly silent, the only sound the relentless drumming of rain against its weathered façade.
