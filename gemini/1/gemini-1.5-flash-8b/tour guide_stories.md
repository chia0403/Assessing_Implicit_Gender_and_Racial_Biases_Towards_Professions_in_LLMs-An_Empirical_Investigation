The biting wind whipped Amelia "Sparrow" Finch's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks as she surveyed the sprawling, grey expanse of the abandoned aerodrome.  Dust devils danced across the cracked tarmac, swirling up bits of rusted metal and forgotten dreams.  This wasn't the picturesque "Golden Age of Flight" brochure photos portrayed.  No, this was the desolate aftermath, a skeletal graveyard of dreams.  Her tour group, a gaggle of wide-eyed tourists clutching lukewarm coffees, huddled closer to the rickety, awning-topped visitor's centre.  It was a bleak October morning, the kind that clung to your bones like damp wool, perfectly mirroring the atmosphere of the place.

Amelia, despite the chill, possessed an unyielding enthusiasm.  Her emerald eyes, usually sparkling with stories, were focused, scanning the landscape. This was her third season guiding tours at the Aerodrome, and every season felt just as raw, just as haunting.  She knew the whispers of the past – the roar of engines, the hushed conversations, the triumphant cheers, the tragic crashes – were all hidden within these crumbling hangers and rusting wings.  Today, she aimed to weave a tapestry of stories, to bring the ghosts of the past to life.  Her voice, usually melodious, was already starting to crack.
