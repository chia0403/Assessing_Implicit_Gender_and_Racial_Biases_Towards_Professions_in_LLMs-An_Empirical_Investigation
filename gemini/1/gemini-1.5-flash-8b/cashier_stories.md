The fluorescent lights of the "Corner Mart" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Juniper's life.  The tiny store, crammed with shelves overflowing with sugary cereals and expired bread, was her universe for the past five years.  Each day began the same: the jarring chime of the door, a hurried customer, the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of the cash register keys, the endless cycle of scanning barcodes and handing out crumpled receipts.  The aroma of stale coffee and yesterday's bakery goods hung heavy in the air, a permanent fixture of the Corner Mart's atmosphere.  Outside, the grey November sky mirrored the dullness of the interior.  Rain lashed against the chipped paint of the storefront, blurring the already indistinct lines between the store and the world beyond.  Amelia, a woman of twenty-seven with perpetually tired eyes, stared down at the receipt, a small, unassuming square of paper that held the weight of someone else's day.
