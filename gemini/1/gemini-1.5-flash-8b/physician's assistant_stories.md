The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine and something subtly metallic, like blood.  Dr. Amelia Hayes, Physician's Assistant, adjusted her lavender-striped scrubs, the fabric clinging to her like a second skin.  The flickering fluorescent lights of the emergency room hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the frenetic activity swirling around her.  Outside, the neon glow of the city pulsed, a chaotic counterpoint to the controlled chaos within.

Amelia, with her short, dark hair pulled back in a tight bun and her tired but focused eyes, felt the familiar pressure building in her chest.  Another night, another influx of the city's troubles, each one demanding her attention, her expertise, her empathy.  Tonight, the waiting room overflowed with the usual suspects â€“ the elderly with chest pains, the young with drunken arguments.  But there was something different, something subtly unsettling, a distinct undercurrent of dread simmering beneath the surface tension.  She felt it in the hesitant glances, the unspoken anxieties etched on the faces around her. Tonight, the city held its breath.
