The biting wind, a relentless, icy fist, clawed at Amelia Blackwood's face as she surveyed the desolate stretch of highway.  A ribbon of black asphalt snaked through a landscape of skeletal, leafless trees, the skeletal branches clawing at a sky the color of bruised plums.  The air, thin and sharp, tasted of pine needles and impending winter.  Amelia, a highway maintenance worker for the State Department of Transportation, adjusted the thick wool scarf that muffled the roar of the wind and her own ragged breaths.  She was stationed at the Mile 12 marker, a lonely outpost on the Transcontinental Highway, a place where the vast emptiness of the American plains stretched to the horizon, broken only by the occasional, forlorn signpost.  It was a Tuesday, the kind of day that could swallow you whole if you weren't careful.  The sun, a pale disc sinking toward the western hills, cast long, eerie shadows that danced with the swirling dust motes in the air.
