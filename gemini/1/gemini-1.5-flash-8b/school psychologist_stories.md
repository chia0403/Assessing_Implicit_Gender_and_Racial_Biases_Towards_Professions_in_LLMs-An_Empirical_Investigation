The fluorescent hum of the school hall buzzed like a disturbed hive, a soundtrack to the cacophony of rustling papers, hushed whispers, and the rhythmic thump of sneakers on linoleum.  Rain hammered against the grimy windows of Northwood High, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Dr. Elara Vance, a school psychologist with a worn leather-bound journal tucked under her arm.  Rain lashed down, cold and relentless, against the decaying brick facade of the school.  Each drop seemed to echo the anxieties, frustrations, and unspoken traumas of the students she saw every day. Northwood High, a school built on the ashes of past glories, now seemed to mirror the fractured lives of its students.  Students with a history of trauma and family instability.  The stained-glass windows, once vibrant with stories of forgotten saints, now displayed a faded, dull palette â€“ reflecting the muted hopes and ambitions of the teenagers passing through the halls.
