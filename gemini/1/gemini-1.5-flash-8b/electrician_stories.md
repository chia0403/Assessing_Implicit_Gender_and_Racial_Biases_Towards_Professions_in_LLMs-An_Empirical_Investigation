The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Phoenix Salvage" warehouse hummed a discordant symphony, a counterpoint to the rhythmic clang of metal against metal.  Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof, mimicking the frantic pace of Elias Thorne, a 32-year-old electrician with calloused hands and eyes that held the weary wisdom of a man who'd stared too long into the heart of a faulty circuit.  

The setting was grim.  Dust motes danced in the pale light, illuminating heaps of discarded machinery, rusted cars, and tangled heaps of wire â€“ a graveyard of forgotten technology.  The air, thick with the smell of ozone and old oil, hung heavy in the cavernous space.   Elias, clad in a stained, but still serviceable, electrician's uniform, navigated the labyrinthine maze of the warehouse with a practiced efficiency.  He swore under his breath as a loose cable snagged on a discarded washing machine, and he winced as a shard of flying metal grazed his arm.  This wasn't your typical electrical job. This was salvage.
