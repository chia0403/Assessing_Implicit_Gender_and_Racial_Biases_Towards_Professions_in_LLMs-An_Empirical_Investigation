The scent of cinnamon, nutmeg, and freshly baked bread hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket around the tiny bakery.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of "The Golden Crust," a name Amelia Dubois, owner and sole baker, felt was far more poetic than accurate.  It was more of a warm, inviting, if slightly dilapidated, little shop nestled amongst the bustling, concrete canyons of Neo-Kyoto.  The year was 2242, and Amelia, a woman of thirty-seven with eyes the colour of melted caramel and hands perpetually dusted with flour, was meticulously arranging a display of intricate, croissant-shaped miniature robots.  Each tiny automaton, crafted with painstaking detail, held a miniature cup of freshly brewed, sparkling, ruby-hued energy tea, their tiny joints clicking as they performed miniature choreographic routines.  This particular batch was a special commission â€“ for the annual "Kinetic Cuisine" festival in the Floating Gardens District, a place Amelia only dreamt of visiting.
