The biting November wind whipped Amelia Hayes's trench coat around her legs, stinging her cheeks as she hurried down the deserted street.  Rain, slick and cold, plastered the faded posters advertising lost puppies and garage sales to the lampposts.  The air hung thick with the scent of damp earth and exhaust fumes, a familiar aroma of the South Side.  She hurried towards the dilapidated brick building that housed the Probation Department, its windows like empty eyes staring out at the encroaching darkness.

Amelia Hayes, probation officer for the 17th District, knew the city’s hidden corners better than the backs of her hands.  She knew the rhythm of the city's pulse – the frantic beat of hurried footsteps, the muffled sobs from shattered homes, the hollow echoes of empty promises.  Tonight, the echo promised to be especially loud. Tonight, a case file, crisp and sterile in her briefcase, held the key to a potential disaster, or perhaps, a glimmer of hope.  The case of fifteen-year-old Leo Rossi, a boy with eyes that held the weight of the world, haunted her waking moments and haunted her restless nights.
