The chipped porcelain sink of the cramped office bathroom reflected Amelia Nightingale's weary face.  Pale moonlight, filtered through the grimy windowpanes, cast long, skeletal shadows across the tiled floor.  Amelia, a secretary at the perpetually understaffed and perpetually disorganized Blackwood & Sons law firm, stared at her reflection.  The faintest hint of mascara smudged her left eye, a testament to the long hours hunched over overflowing inboxes and the relentless clatter of keyboards in the office below.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation.

The office building, a squat, grey monolith perched precariously on a hill overlooking the sprawling industrial wasteland of the city, whispered secrets in the wind.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light illuminating the narrow staircase leading up to her third-floor office.  Amelia sighed, a sound barely audible above the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of a distant train.  This was not the life she'd envisioned.  Not the life meticulously planned with crisp, organized calendars and meticulously colored highlighters.  Tonight, however, even the highlighters seemed muted, dull echoes of the vibrant hopes she'd carried with her as she'd first walked into that same grimy building, five years ago.
