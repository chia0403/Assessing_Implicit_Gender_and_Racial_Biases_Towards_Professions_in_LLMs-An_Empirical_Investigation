The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow on Amelia Blackwood's face, highlighting the faint stubble that stubbornly clung to her jawline.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless percussion that mirrored the steady rhythm of the clinking glasses and muted conversations inside.  The bar, a dimly lit haven nestled in the heart of the rain-slicked, forgotten backstreets of Veridian, was a tapestry woven from the shadows of weary travellers and whispered secrets.  Dust motes danced in the single, flickering bulb above the bar, illuminating the chipped Formica countertop and the chipped mugs and glasses reflecting the pale light like broken stars.  Amelia, a woman built like a sturdy oak, stood behind the bar, her movements practiced and efficient. Her name, a whisper on the night air, was the only thing not dulled by the bar's tired atmosphere.
