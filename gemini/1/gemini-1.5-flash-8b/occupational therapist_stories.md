The fluorescent lights of the Occupational Therapy department hummed, a low, insistent drone that seemed to vibrate through Amelia Rose Hawthorne's very bones.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun slicing through the grimy windowpanes, illuminating a chaotic scene.  A stack of colourful therapy toys lay precariously balanced on a table, amongst scattered paperwork and half-eaten lunch remnants.

The scent of antiseptic clung to the air, a constant reminder of the fragility of the human body, of the invisible battles fought daily within the walls of St. Jude's Rehabilitation Centre.  Today was Wednesday, the day of the intensive group sessions for the stroke patients.  The clock on the wall ticked with a relentless, almost mocking rhythm.
