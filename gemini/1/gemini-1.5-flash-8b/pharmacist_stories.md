The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Apothecary's Corner" hummed a monotonous tune, punctuated only by the rhythmic *clink* of Amelia Cavendish's spatula as she meticulously measured out powdered ginger.  Dust motes danced in the pale, hospital-like light, reflecting off the rows of neatly organized jars and bottles.  A faint scent of lavender mingled with the antiseptic tang of disinfectant, a familiar aroma that had been her constant companion since she was a child.  Apothecary's Corner, nestled in the heart of the quiet, windswept town of Oakhaven, was more than just a store; it was a sanctuary, a place where the mundane could be momentarily forgotten amidst the comforting alchemy of healing remedies.  Amelia, a pharmacist with a heart as delicate as the rosehip petals she used in her cough syrups, felt a familiar ache in her chest, a feeling almost as potent as the potent herbal teas she sold.  Today, that ache was tinged with a premonition, a faint whisper in the quiet hum of the store that something profound was about to shift.
