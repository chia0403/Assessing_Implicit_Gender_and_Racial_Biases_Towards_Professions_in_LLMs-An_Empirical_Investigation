The biting wind whipped around Elias Thorne, a carpenter with calloused hands and eyes that held the stories of countless weathered timbers.  He hunched deeper into his worn leather coat, the scent of pine needles and damp earth clinging to the air.  October painted the sky in bruised purples and fiery oranges, a stark contrast to the grey, perpetually overcast morning in the shadowed valley of Blackwood.  Elias was, as always, on the edge of the forest, a place where the whispering pines seemed to hold their breath, waiting for the approaching winter.  His destination: the dilapidated cottage nestled deep within the woods, a house that had known better days, a house Elias was determined to reclaim.  Years ago, its jovial warmth had been a beacon in the valley, but now, only an echo remained.  Elias was not just a carpenter; he was a whisperer of stories, and the house, with its creaking timbers and ghostly gaps in its walls, held a tale he felt compelled to revive.
