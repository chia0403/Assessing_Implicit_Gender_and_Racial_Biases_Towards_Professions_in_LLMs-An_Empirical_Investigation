Broken windows stared out at a cityscape buzzing with life, a stark contrast to the stillness within.  The only signs of recent activity were the scattered remnants of a life – a half-finished jigsaw puzzle, a chipped porcelain doll, and the faint scent of lavender soap, trapped in the musty air.  Eleanor adjusted her lab coat, the fabric clinging to the dampness seeping through her jeans.  Her boots crunched on the debris-strewn floor, each footstep echoing in the vast, echoing space. This case, assigned by the unconventional but insightful Detective Harding, smelled of years gone by, of secrets buried deep. This was more than just a missing person; this was a piece of a puzzle she desperately wanted to reconstruct.
