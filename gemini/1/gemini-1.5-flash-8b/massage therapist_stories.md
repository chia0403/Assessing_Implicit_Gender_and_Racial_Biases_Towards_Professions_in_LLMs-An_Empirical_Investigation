Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Anya Petrova's tiny massage therapy studio, a space squeezed between a bustling bakery and a secondhand bookstore.  The scent of cinnamon and damp earth mingled in the air, a comforting, if slightly unusual, aroma.  Inside, the faint hum of a Himalayan salt lamp cast a warm orange glow on Anya's worn, but meticulously organized, workspace.  Anya, with her dark hair pulled back in a braid, expertly manipulated the knotted muscles of a client – a lanky, perpetually worried-looking man named Mr. Henderson.  The rhythmic clicking of her knuckles against Mr. Henderson's back was the only sound save the relentless drumming of the rain.  Outside, the muted gray light of a pre-dawn Tokyo morning, tinged with a hint of approaching autumn, painted the cityscape in subdued tones.  This was Anya’s sanctuary, a place where the city’s relentless pulse slowed to a gentle, rhythmic beat.
