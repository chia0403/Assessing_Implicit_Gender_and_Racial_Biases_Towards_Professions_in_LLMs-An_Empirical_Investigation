The flickering neon sign of the "Cosmic Carousel" cast a sickly yellow glow over the alley, illuminating dust motes dancing in the humid air.  Rain, a persistent, almost rhythmic drumming on the corrugated iron roof, punctuated the low hum of transformers that seemed to vibrate through Amelia Blackwood's very bones.  Amelia, a radio technician with fingers as nimble as hummingbird wings, crouched beside a tangled jumble of wires, antennae, and mismatched capacitors. The air smelled of ozone and burnt solder, a familiar fragrance that clung to her clothes and hair.  This was her sanctuary, this forgotten corner of the city, a place where the whispers of radio waves mingled with the city's own ragged breathing.  The "Cosmic Carousel", a struggling antique radio repair shop, was a relic itself, a testament to a bygone era of crackling static and whispered secrets carried on the airwaves.  Her name, a delicate counterpoint to the raw energy of the alley, seemed almost too soft, too fragile to match the relentless, powerful currents she was trying to coax into harmony.
