The flickering fluorescent lights of Dr. Amelia Thorne's office hummed a monotonous tune, a stark contrast to the rhythmic crackle of the old oak floorboards beneath her feet.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight piercing the grime-coated windowpane, illuminating a chipped mug of lukewarm chamomile tea on her cluttered desk.  Amelia Thorne, D.C., adjusted her glasses, the faintest trace of a smile playing on her lips.  Her office, nestled in the heart of the bustling but decaying industrial district of New Haven, was a testament to both her pragmatism and her years of practice.  Tapestry-covered antique furniture stood alongside a collection of battered workout equipment, a strange juxtaposition that somehow worked.  The faint aroma of lavender oil and old paper hung heavy in the air, a familiar scent that had become the soundtrack of her life.

Outside, the city's relentless rhythm of honking taxis and the clatter of construction equipment roared, a constant reminder of the stresses plaguing her patients.  Today, however, the noise seemed less aggressive, moreâ€¦ resigned. The city was in a lulling lull, a period of quiet reflection before the next wave of anxiety washed over it.
