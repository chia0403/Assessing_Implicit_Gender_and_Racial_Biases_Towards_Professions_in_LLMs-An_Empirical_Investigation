The biting November wind whipped Amelia Cavendish's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks like shards of ice.  Rain, a relentless, pewter-grey curtain, obscured the already gloomy cityscape of Port Veridian.  The city, nestled in a valley choked by towering, perpetually overcast mountains, felt perpetually damp, a suffocating shroud draped over the sprawling concrete sprawl.  Amelia, a staff writer for the *Veridian Chronicle*, huddled deeper into her threadbare coat, her breath clouding in the frigid air.  The flickering neon sign of the 'Rusty Mug' coffee shop cast a sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked pavement, the only warmth in this monochrome landscape.  Tonight, she was on a story that felt as cold and unyielding as the weather itself.  The source, a whispered rumour among the city's shadowy underbelly, was leading her deeper into the heart of Port Veridian's labyrinthine tunnels and back alleys.  The whispers spoke of something vast, something sinister, hidden beneath the veneer of the seemingly ordinary.  Amelia pressed her notebook tighter against her chest, the promise of a scoop hanging heavy in the air, thick with anticipation and the chilling dread of the unknown.
