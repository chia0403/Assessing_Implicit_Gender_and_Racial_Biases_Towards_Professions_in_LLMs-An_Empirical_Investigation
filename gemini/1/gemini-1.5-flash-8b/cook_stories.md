The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the chipped Formica countertop, illuminating the swirling mists of garlic and rosemary that hung heavy in the air of "The Rusty Spoon."  A lone figure, Amelia Blackwood, hunched over a simmering pot of lamb stew, her brow furrowed in concentration.

Amelia, her apron stained a deep, almost burgundy crimson from the day's efforts,  was the heart of this little, unassuming tavern, situated on the edge of the Whispering Woods, just beyond the market town of Oakhaven.  The tavern was a haven for weary travelers, the lost and the lonely, each a story waiting to be whispered into existence amongst the clatter of mugs and the soft murmur of conversation.
