The fluorescent lights of Dr. Amelia Petrova's office hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the rhythmic click-clack of her drill.  Amelia, a dentist with a practiced efficiency that belied the tremor in her hand, meticulously filed a molar, the grinding sound a counterpoint to the insistent tapping of her fingers against the armrest of her chair.  Outside, the grey London sky mirrored the gloom settling in her heart.  Rain lashed against the windowpanes, blurring the already-muted colours of the city.

**Setting:**

Amelia's dental practice, "Petrova's Pearly Whites," was a small, slightly cramped but surprisingly comfortable office tucked away on a side street in the heart of London's East End.  The antiseptic smell of disinfectant hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the faint, comforting aroma of Earl Grey tea emanating from a nearby pot.  Rows of polished dental chairs lined the walls, each a silent testament to the countless smiles Amelia had shaped over the years.  The muted colours of the office walls and furnishings – deep greens and creams – offered a subtle, calming counterpoint to the often-stressful experience of a dental visit.  The city buzzed outside, a symphony of sirens and car horns, a constant reminder of the world that existed beyond the four walls of her practice.
