The fluorescent lights of the accounting firm, "Numbers & Nuggets," hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Peabody's meticulously ordered life.  Amelia, a certified public accountant with a penchant for spreadsheets and precision, stared at the latest quarterly report.  Rows of figures, meticulously recorded, swam before her eyes.  The numbers, usually so comforting in their predictability, felt unsettlingly volatile this time.  Hidden amongst the tidy columns, a pattern emerged, a whisper of something amiss.  The air in the cramped office, usually thick with the scent of stale coffee and recycled paper, felt heavier, charged with a subtle, unnerving energy.

The setting was a small, nondescript office building nestled on a quiet side street of the bustling city of Oakhaven.  Windows, frosted with grime and perpetually shadowed by overcast skies, offered a glimpse into the muted palette of the surrounding urban sprawl.  The office itself was a classic example of efficient but uninspired design: beige walls, worn laminate desks, and the persistent aroma of cheap coffee.  A constant drone of keyboard clicks and the low murmur of hushed conversations punctuated the otherwise quiet atmosphere, a rhythmic undercurrent beneath the tension Amelia felt growing within her.  Outside, the city breathed, oblivious to the potential storm brewing within the small office.
