The biting wind, a relentless sculptor of its own, whipped across the craggy peaks of the Silvan Mountains.  Dust, fine and gritty, stung Elara Stonehand's eyes as she peered up at the face of the mountain.  It was a face carved not by nature, but by generations of stone-cutters like her.  The mountain, they called it "The Whispering Colossus,"  a formidable presence that held secrets within its ancient stone.  Elara, whose real name was Elara Greystone,  had been carving at its granite heart since she was a girl, her hands, calloused and strong, a testament to her lifelong dedication.  The air, thin and crisp, held the faint scent of pine and the distant, mournful cry of a raven.

The year was 1472, and the village of Stonehaven, nestled in the valley below, clung to the mountain like ivy.  Wooden houses, weathered and painted in muted hues of ochre and grey, lined the winding streets, their roofs sloping steeply to shed the relentless winter snows.  Every structure, every tool, every piece of furniture in the village bore the mark of stone, a silent testament to the mountain's relentless influence. Elara's workshop, a small, dark cavern carved into the mountainside itself, was her sanctuary, her forge, and her prison.  The echoing clang of her hammer against stone was a symphony only she could truly hear.   Within this silent world of stone, Elara pursued her artistry, chasing a vision sculpted not in granite, but in the very essence of the mountain itself.
