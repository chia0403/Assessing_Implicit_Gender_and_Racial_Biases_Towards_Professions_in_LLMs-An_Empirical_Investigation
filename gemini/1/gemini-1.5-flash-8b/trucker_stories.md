The fluorescent lights of the truck stop hummed, a monotonous counterpoint to the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Amelia "Truck"  Harding's heart.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light slicing through the haze of stale coffee and diesel fumes.  Outside, the vast, flat expanse of the Kansas plains stretched to the horizon, a monochrome canvas painted in shades of beige and ochre.  The air, thick with the smell of roadkill and exhaust, hung heavy, mirroring the weight in Truck's chest.  She'd been hauling a shipment of highly sensitive medical equipment, a consignment more precious than any load of grain or cattle she'd ever carried.  The cargo, bound for a remote research facility in the Arizona desert, held a secret as vital as the lives it was meant to save.  Tonight, however, the secret felt more like a cage, tightening around her heart with every blink of the fluorescent lights.  The night promised a long haul, and Truck wasn't sure she could bear the pressure.
