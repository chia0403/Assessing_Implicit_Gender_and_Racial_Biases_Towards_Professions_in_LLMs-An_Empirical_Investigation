The aroma of freshly baked vanilla and sugared almonds hung thick in the air, mingling with the faint scent of lavender that clung to the crisp white curtains of Amelia "Amy" Butterfield's tiny bakery, "Crumbs of Comfort."  Sunlight, fractured by a thousand glittering sugar crystals on the windowsill, painted stripes of gold across the counter where Amy meticulously piped a perfect rose onto a buttercream-covered cake.  Her hands, nimble and precise, moved with the practiced grace of a seasoned dancer.  The tiny bakery, tucked away on a cobbled side street in the heart of the bustling city of Aethelgard, buzzed with the low murmur of conversations and the rhythmic click-clack of Amy's piping bag. A chipped porcelain teacup sat on the counter, steaming with a barely perceptible tea smell, and a framed portrait of a mischievous-eyed ginger cat hung above the pastry case, a seemingly endless display of colourful cupcakes and tiered wedding cakes.  The soft chime of the bell above the door announced a customer, and Amy, glancing up from her creation, smiled. Todayâ€™s customer was a mysterious one indeed, their entrance cloaked in an aura of mystery.
