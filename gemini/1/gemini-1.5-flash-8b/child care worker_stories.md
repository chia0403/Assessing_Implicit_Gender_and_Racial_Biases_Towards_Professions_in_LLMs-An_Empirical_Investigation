The chipped paint on the walls of the "Little Explorers" daycare center seemed to sigh with the afternoon humidity.  Sunlight, filtered through the dusty blinds, cast long, wavering shadows across the brightly coloured play mats and meticulously arranged blocks.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a rhythmic drumming that seemed to echo the frantic energy of the children inside.  Amelia Blackwood, a young woman with eyes that held the quiet wisdom of someone older than her twenty-two years, checked the clock.  3:15 PM.  Almost time.
