The sterile, fluorescent hum of the operating room was a constant, almost soothing, backdrop to Dr. Eleanor Vanceâ€™s world.  Surgical steel gleamed under the harsh lights, reflecting in the sweat beading on her brow.  The rhythmic *click-clack* of the instruments, the rhythmic *thump-thump* of the patient's heart monitor, were the only sounds that mattered.  This, this was where she felt most alive.

The setting:  St. Jude's Hospital, a sprawling, ivy-covered institution in the heart of a rapidly gentrifying district of Chicago.  Its imposing presence, a testament to decades of medical innovation, stood in stark contrast to the edgy urban sprawl that clawed at its borders.  The air in the operating theatre, usually crisp with the scent of antiseptic, carried a faint metallic tang, a lingering trace of the surgery just concluded.  This was her life. This was where she had chosen to dedicate herself, a surgeon in a city that never truly slept, where the pulse of life, and death, beat with a relentless rhythm.
