The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow on Amelia Seraphina Hayes's rain-slicked apron.  The air hung thick with the smell of stale coffee, burnt sugar, and desperation.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless rhythm that mirrored the frantic beat of Amelia's heart. Tonight, the Rusty Mug was quieter than a graveyard, a stark contrast to the usual boisterous clientele.  Amelia, barely scraping by and with the weight of her grandmother's failing health pressing down on her shoulders, felt a knot of anxiety tighten in her stomach. Tonight, the quiet felt ominous.


The Rusty Mug was a dive bar nestled in the forgotten corner of Oakhaven, a town that clung to its past like a stubborn old woman.  Cobblestone streets, choked with ivy and the ghosts of forgotten carriages, wound their way through the town, leading to a central square dominated by a towering, cracked clock tower. The air was thick with the scent of pine needles and damp earth, a humid perfume that carried with it the whisper of a thousand stories, some lost to time, others, perhaps, just waiting to unfold.  Inside, the bar itself was a testament to its fading glory.  The polished wood of the bar counter was scarred, the booths stained with spilled drinks and forgotten tears.  Dusty portraits of long-dead Oakhaven townsfolk gazed down from the walls, their eyes seeming to follow Amelia as she moved through the empty space.
