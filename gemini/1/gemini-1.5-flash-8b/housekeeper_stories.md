Massive, oak-paneled doors, each heavier than a grown man, guarded passageways that seemed to stretch endlessly into the gloom.  A pervasive scent of aged mahogany and something indefinably floral clung to the air, a ghostly echo of countless parties and whispered secrets held within the decaying walls.  The house, once a symbol of grandeur and wealth, now felt like a mausoleum, its grandeur slowly succumbing to the relentless march of time.
