The flickering gaslight cast long, skeletal shadows across the butcher shop, highlighting the glint of steel on Bartholomew "Barty" Grimshaw's cleaver.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom, illuminating the glistening crimson pools that stained the worn wooden floor.  The air, thick with the scent of blood and aged meat, hung heavy and still, punctuated only by the rhythmic thud of Bartyâ€™s knife against bone and the occasional, guttural groan from the scavenging rats beneath the counter.  The shop, nestled in the shadowed alleyways of 1888 London, was a cold, unforgiving place, a world of whispers and shadows, where the only true light came from the brutal efficiency of Barty's trade.
