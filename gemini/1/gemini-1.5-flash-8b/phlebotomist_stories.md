The fluorescent hum of the Nightingale Clinic buzzed like a trapped bee, a constant, irritating soundtrack to Elara Vance’s workday.  Sunlight, weak and filtered through the grimy city windows, cast long shadows across the sterile white walls, highlighting the dust motes dancing in the air.  Elara, a phlebotomist with a constellation of tiny, almost invisible scars scattered across her arms – a testament to countless venipunctures –  adjusted the antiseptic wipes on the tray.  The metallic tang of disinfectant clung to the air, a familiar, almost comforting smell.  Today, the waiting room, normally a cacophony of coughs and sighs, was eerily quiet.  Only the rhythmic click-clack of her steel-toed shoes on the linoleum broke the silence.  A single, flickering candle, nestled precariously on a nearby counter, cast dancing shadows that seemed to mock the sterile, clinical environment. The smell of lavender, artificially sweet, hung heavy in the air;  a sharp contrast to the metallic tang.
