The fluorescent lights of the "Ironclad Fitness" gym hummed, a relentless drone that barely registered above the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Amelia "Hammer" Hamilton's own heartbeat.  Sweat, thick and salty, clung to her sculpted arms as she expertly demonstrated a kettlebell swing, her voice a powerful contralto cutting through the air, punctuated by the sharp crack of the bell against steel.  This was her world, a concrete jungle of mirrors and motivating music, a stage for her own brand of iron-willed, results-driven fitness.  The smell of ozone and cheap protein shakes filled the air, a familiar comfort in the otherwise sterile space.  Amelia, with her fiery red hair pulled back in a tight braid, stood at the heart of it all, a beacon of determined energy. The sleek chrome weights gleamed around her, almost mocking the meager efforts of the few remaining clients still clinging to their resistance bands.  It was a Tuesday night, and the vast majority of the gym's clientele were already home, lost to their various post-work routines or perhaps simply seeking respite from the relentless pace of the city. Tonight, only a small contingent remained â€“ a quiet, dedicated group who had bought into her mantra: "No pain, no gain."  Tonight, she wanted to prove it was true.
