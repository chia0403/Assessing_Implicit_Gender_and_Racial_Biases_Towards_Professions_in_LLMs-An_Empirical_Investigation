The chipped paint of the "Emerald Nightingale" sign, barely clinging to the crumbling brick facade, reflected the neon glow of the alleyway.  Rain slicked the cobblestones, mirroring the sheen of sweat on Amelia Nightingaleâ€™s brow.  Amelia, a name whispered with a mix of adoration and pity in the smoky dens and backroom clubs of the city, adjusted the worn leather strap of her guitar case.  Her crimson dress, once vibrant, now clung to her like a second skin, damp and clinging to the remnants of a thousand spilled drinks and whispered confessions. Tonight, the Emerald Nightingale, a dive bar barely holding onto its last vestiges of charm, was her stage.  This particular alley, a labyrinth of shadows and forgotten dreams, was her backstage.
