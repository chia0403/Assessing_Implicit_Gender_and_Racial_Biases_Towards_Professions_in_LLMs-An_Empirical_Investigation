The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Blackwood's hands, the faint scent of chamomile clinging to the air like a spectral whisper.  Sunlight, fractured by the stained-glass window of her office, painted a kaleidoscope of color across the cluttered desk, illuminating dust motes dancing in the beam.  Amelia, a clinical psychologist with a practiced, almost weary, grace, traced the rim of the mug with a fingertip.  Outside, the city, a restless beast of concrete and steel, rumbled with a symphony of traffic and hurried footsteps.  Her office, nestled in the quiet heart of a historic neighborhood just a stone's throw from the heart of the city's frenetic energy, was a sanctuary of sorts, a carefully constructed haven from the relentless clamor of human experience. This particular morning, however, felt unusually charged.  The air hummed with a low, almost imperceptible anxiety, a feeling she recognized all too well, the pre-storm stillness before the emotional tempest broke.  Across the worn leather desk lay a manila envelope, sealed with a wax stamp bearing the image of a single, unblinking eye.  Amelia's name, embossed in elegant script on the top, held both a sense of anticipation and a creeping unease.  The unknown, as always, lurked within.  She took a slow sip of tea, a tiny, almost imperceptible tremor running through her, a subtle reflection of the unknown waiting just beyond the edge of the envelop.
