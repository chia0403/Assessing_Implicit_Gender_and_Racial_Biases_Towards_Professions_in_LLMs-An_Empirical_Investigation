The chipped paint of the chalkboard, a faded imitation of a once-vibrant teal, reflected the harsh fluorescent light of Ms. Amelia Hawthorne's classroom.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of sunlight slicing through the grimy window, illuminating a pile of forgotten textbooks and a half-eaten bag of stale pretzels near the recycling bin.  Amelia, a high school English teacher with eyes the color of stormy seas and hair the shade of burnt umber, sighed, the sound barely audible above the muted chatter of her students.  It was a Tuesday, the day of the dreaded poetry unit, and already the air in room 207 felt thick with unspoken teenage anxieties and the faint aroma of desperation.  

The school, Northwood High, was a monument to forgotten grandeur.  The faded murals depicting mythological figures in the hallways whispered of a time when the halls echoed with the laughter of students who cared more for their academics, but now the echoes were mostly the hushed whispers of students worried about their grades and their futures.  The looming presence of the old oak trees, their branches stretching across the campus like skeletal arms, cast a perpetual twilight over the courtyard, a feeling that somehow mirrored the disquiet in the students' hearts.
