The chipped porcelain sink, stained a sickly yellow from years of lukewarm water and forgotten soaps, gurgled softly as Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, a barber with eyes the colour of faded plums and hands that still held the delicate precision of a craftsman, washed his final shaving brush.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight piercing the gloom of his tiny shop, "The Clipper's Cut," nestled on a cobbled street in the heart of the decaying, yet somehow vibrant, port city of Alderhaven.  Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes, a relentless percussion that echoed the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the old grandfather clock in the corner, its pendulum a metronome marking the passage of time, oblivious to the drama that frequently unfolded within the confines of the shop.  Barty, a man of routine, carefully hung the brush, its bristles still damp, on the rack beside a collection of faded, leather-bound journals filled with poetic musings and half-written stories, secrets he guarded from the world outside.
