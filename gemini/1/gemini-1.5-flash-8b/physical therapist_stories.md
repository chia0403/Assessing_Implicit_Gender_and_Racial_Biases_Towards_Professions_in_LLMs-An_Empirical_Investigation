The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's trench coat around her legs as she hurried down the narrow cobblestone streets of Edinburgh.  Grey skies, perpetually draped over the city like a damp shroud, mirrored the gloom settling in Amelia's chest.  The rhythmic thump-thump-thump of her boots on the uneven stones was the only sound accompanying her solitary walk.  She was late, as she frequently was, for her appointment with Angus MacDougall, a renowned but notoriously demanding client.  He'd injured his prized left knee during a particularly enthusiastic round of Highland games.  Angus, with his fierce independence and sculpted physique, represented a challenge for Amelia beyond the usual physiotherapy needs.  It was a challenge she, despite her best efforts, seemed perpetually on the brink of failing.

The setting was the historic Old Town of Edinburgh, Scotland.  Jagged stone buildings, their faces weathered by centuries of wind and rain, clawed at the sky.  Narrow alleys, barely wide enough for a single person, snaked between them, shrouded in a perpetual twilight.  The faint aroma of freshly baked bread and peat smoke drifted in from hidden closes, a comforting counterpoint to the overall melancholy of the day.  The air hummed with the quiet energy of a city steeped in history, a palpable presence that both intimidated and inspired Amelia.  She was, after all, a physical therapist navigating the complexities of a place as steeped in tradition as she was in her own struggles.
