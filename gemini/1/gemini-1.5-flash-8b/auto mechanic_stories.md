The greasy haze hung thick in the air of "Rusty Wrench," a tiny auto repair shop tucked between a struggling bakery and a perpetually-overflowing laundromat.  Sunlight, weak and filtered through grime-coated windows, cast long, distorted shadows across the cluttered space.  Tools, some gleaming, others dull with age and use, littered workbenches beside stacks of manuals and half-finished projects.  This was the domain of Bartholomew "Barty"  Fitzwilliam, a man whose hands, calloused and strong, spoke volumes about a lifetime spent coaxing life back into sputtering engines and rusted chassis.  Today, however, the air held a particular tension.  A beat-up, maroon Ford Falcon, its hood propped open like a wounded beast, dominated one corner of the shop.  Inside, a single, flickering light bulb cast a mournful glow on the engine's intricate network of wires and hoses.  Barty, hunched over the engine, felt a knot of anxiety tighten in his stomach.  He'd been working on this car for three days, and the problem was proving stubbornly elusive.
