Okay, here's a story opening with a setting and a main character:

**Opening & Setting:**

The clatter of silverware against ceramic, the low hum of conversation, the sizzling promise of steaks hitting a hot grill – it was the familiar symphony of “The Golden Steer,” and it was driving Amelia Rose Hayes slowly, steadily insane. Not insane in a throw-napkins-at-the-patrons-and-yell-about-the-lobster-bibs kind of way, but more of a quiet, internal, simmering frustration that threatened to bubble over like a forgotten pot of cream sauce.

The Golden Steer was a landmark in the small, tourist-trap town of Port Blossom, Maine. Situated right on the harbor, its nautical theme was less charming antique and more 'dusty-lobster-pots-and-faded-fishing-nets.' The red and white striped awning flapped listlessly in the sea breeze, offering a shade that did little to alleviate the sweltering summer heat that permeated the restaurant, clinging to everything like the faint smell of fried clams. Amelia knew every chipped plate, every wobbly table leg, every saccharine portrait of sailboats that adorned the walls. She’d been serving there, begrudgingly, for five long summers, a prison sentence dressed in a crisp, but ill-fitting, Golden Steer uniform. Tonight, the place was packed. Tourists fresh off the ferry, red-faced and hungry, were vying for tables.
