## Story Opening:

The humid Charleston air hung thick and heavy, clinging to Eliza Mae Dubois like a second skin as she wrestled with the overflowing flower box on the porch of 12 Tradd Street. She hated petunias. They were fussy, prone to blight, and, frankly, completely predictable. Just like the clientele she typically catered to in the historic district.

She heaved a final, disgruntled sigh, wiping a bead of sweat from her brow with the back of her hand, smearing a streak of dirt across her forehead in the process. This house, though, 12 Tradd Street, was different. It whispered stories of generations past, of laughter and loss, of secrets tucked away in the wainscoting and buried beneath the centuries-old oak tree in the garden. It deserved more than a pot of predictable petunias. It deserved something… alive.

Eliza straightened, pushing a stray strand of her auburn hair behind her ear. It was an early Thursday morning, the kind where the city still slumbered beneath a blanket of heat, and the scent of salt and pluff mud hung heavy in the air. She had a showing in an hour, and she desperately hoped the potential buyers would see beyond the peeling paint and the slightly askew shutters. She hoped they’d hear the house's secrets too.

## Setting:

The story is set in Charleston, South Carolina, primarily in the historic district. The scene takes place on the porch of a grand, yet slightly dilapidated, antebellum house located at 12 Tradd Street. The house boasts a classic Charleston architectural style, with a wide, columned porch, second-story piazzas, and intricate ironwork. Wisteria vines climb the facade, partially obscuring the peeling paint. Inside, the house features high ceilings, original hardwood floors, and ornate plasterwork, all bearing the marks of age and neglect.
