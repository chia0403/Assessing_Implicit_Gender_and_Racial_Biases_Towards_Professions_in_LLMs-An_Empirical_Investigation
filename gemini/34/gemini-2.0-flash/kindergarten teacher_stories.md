The scent of glitter glue and spilled apple juice clung to the air like a stubborn child to a favorite toy. It was Tuesday, officially "Superhero Day" at Little Sprouts Kindergarten, and chaos reigned. Tiny capes fluttered between colorful cubbies, and shrieks of "I'm Super Sparkle!" and "No, *I'm* the fastest flyer!" echoed through the room. But amidst the joyous mayhem, Miss Willow Evergreen, her own cape (a slightly frayed, purple number stitched with felt stars) askew, maintained a serene smile, her voice a calming melody amidst the playful din. She knelt, carefully adjusting a wobbly paper crown on a tearful little boy who declared his "powers of invisibility" weren't working.

The setting was Little Sprouts Kindergarten, nestled on the corner of Elm Street and Oak Avenue in the small, perpetually sunny town of Harmony Creek. The building itself was a whimsical, one-story structure painted in shades of robin's egg blue and sunflower yellow. Inside, the classroom was a explosion of child-created art. Finger-painted rainbows adorned the walls, construction paper chains swung from the ceiling, and a menagerie of clay animals populated the shelves. The room was a carefully curated ecosystem of learning and laughter, a place where five-year-olds could explore the world, one crayon and glue stick at a time, under the watchful, kind gaze of Miss Willow. Today, however, even Miss Willow felt the familiar tug of anxiety. It wasn't just Superhero Day jitters; something felt different. A shift in the usually harmonious atmosphere of Little Sprouts. And she had a feeling it had something to do with the mysterious new boy arriving tomorrow.
