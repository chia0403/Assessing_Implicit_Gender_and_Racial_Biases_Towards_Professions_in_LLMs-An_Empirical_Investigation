## Story Opening:

The chipped, yellow paint of the playground fence mocked Miss Eleanor Abigail Finch. Each spring, the school district promised fresh paint, a vibrant blue that would match the sky and reflect in the children's eyes. Each spring, budget cuts happened, and Eleanor found herself once again staring at the peeling, sun-bleached barrier that whispered tales of forgotten promises. Today, though, the fence wasn't her biggest worry. It was the silence. A heavy, unsettling silence that hung in the air where normally the joyous cacophony of ten-year-olds would be reaching a fever pitch.

It was almost lunchtime. The air, usually thick with the smell of peanut butter and jelly and playground dust, was still and expectant. Even the crows, normally squawking arguments over discarded lunch scraps, were silent sentinels perched atop the sagging basketball hoops. Eleanor gripped the clipboard in her hand a little tighter, the edges digging into her palm. Something was wrong. Terribly, terribly wrong.

## Setting:

Eleanor teaches fifth grade at **Oakwood Elementary School**, a small, somewhat dilapidated school nestled in the heart of **Hickory Creek, Iowa**. The town is a sleepy, mostly agricultural community where everyone knows everyone, and generations of families have walked the same halls of Oakwood. The school itself is a one-story building with long, echoing hallways, linoleum floors that haven't been polished in years, and classrooms filled with the remnants of decades of learning. The playground, bordered by the aforementioned yellow fence, features a rusty jungle gym, two swing sets with frayed chains, a cracked basketball court, and a sprawling oak tree that serves as a natural meeting place and a silent observer of all the childhood dramas that unfold beneath its branches. Outside the playground, cornfields stretch as far as the eye can see, a constant reminder of the town's dependence on the land and its deeply rooted traditions.
