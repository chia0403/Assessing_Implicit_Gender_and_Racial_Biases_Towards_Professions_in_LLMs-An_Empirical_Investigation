## Story Opening:

The scent of eucalyptus and desperation hung heavy in the air of Dr. Eleanor Beatrice Finch’s office. Rain lashed against the large, bay window overlooking Elm Street, mimicking the tempest brewing in her patient’s face. Eleanor sighed, pushing a stray strand of her auburn hair behind her ear. Mr. Henderson, a retired accountant with a neck stiffer than a poorly-cared-for tombstone, was currently attempting to contort himself into a pretzel shape on her adjusting table.

"Alright, Mr. Henderson, just breathe deep," Eleanor instructed, her voice a practiced blend of soothing and firm. "We're going to gently work out this kink. Now, tell me again, what were you doing that caused this… predicament?"

Mr. Henderson grunted, his face flushed. "Trying… to… reach… the top… shelf… of… the… pantry…" Each word was punctuated with a strained gasp.

Eleanor, however, suspected the real culprit was his competitive bingo habit and the aggressive dabber he wielded with the ferocity of a medieval knight. Still, a paying patient was a paying patient, and rent was due next week.

## Setting:

Dr. Eleanor Beatrice Finch's practice, "Finch Family Chiropractic," was nestled in the heart of Havenwood, a sleepy, quintessential New England town. The office itself was a converted Victorian house, painted a calming shade of sage green with crisp white trim. Inside, the waiting room boasted a well-worn charm with mismatched armchairs upholstered in floral patterns, a stack of well-thumbed National Geographic magazines, and a bubbling fish tank populated by a perpetually surprised-looking goldfish named Bubbles. The adjusting room, where Eleanor performed her magic (or, as some cynics called it, her “cracking and popping”), was a brighter space, dominated by a sturdy chiropractic table and lined with anatomical charts showcasing the intricate architecture of the human spine. Sunlight, when it bothered to grace Havenwood with its presence, streamed through the bay window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and painting the room in a warm, inviting glow. In short, it was a space that felt both professional and personal, a reflection of Eleanor herself - capable and dedicated, but with a soft heart beneath a veneer of no-nonsense practicality.
