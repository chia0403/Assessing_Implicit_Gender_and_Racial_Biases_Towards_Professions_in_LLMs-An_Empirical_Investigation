The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, carrying with it a fine, gritty snow that stung Elias Thorne’s cheeks. He didn’t register it, not really. He was too busy staring, mesmerized, at the Chicago Board Options Exchange, its imposing art deco facade shimmering under the sodium glow of the streetlights. It was 5:45 AM, far too early for most of the city’s inhabitants, but for Elias, the B.O.E. was already pulsing with life, a slumbering beast stirring in its concrete cage, ready to devour fortunes and spew out dreams in equal measure.

Elias Thorne, all six-foot-two of him, pulled his threadbare cashmere scarf tighter around his neck, the worn edges frayed from years of nervous fidgeting. His breath plumed in white clouds as he mentally ran through his morning prep: scan overnight news, review key performance indicators, triple-check the risk assessments. It was a well-worn routine, a ritual designed to soothe the gnawing anxiety that had been his constant companion since he'd left behind the farm in Iowa and stepped into the roaring, ruthless world of high finance. He adjusted the strap of his worn leather briefcase, its contents holding the future, or at least, the promise of it. Another day, another chance to prove himself, to claw his way up from the bottom of Thorne Capital, to finally feel worthy of the name he bore. The weight of expectation, and the cold, settled deep in his bones. He just hoped he could weather the storm brewing on the horizon.
