The biting wind, smelling of pine and coming straight off the snow-capped peaks of the Cascade Mountains, snaked its way through the gaps in the old barn door. Bartholomew "Bart" Davies cursed under his breath, pulling his worn Carhartt jacket tighter around him. He could feel the chill right down to his bones, and he hadn't even started his morning fire yet.

The setting was the small, unincorporated town of Stillwater Creek, nestled deep in the heart of Washington State. It was a place where cell service was a luxury, not a right, and where the rhythm of life was dictated by the changing seasons and the needs of the land. Most of the residents were loggers, farmers, or, like Bart, skilled tradesmen who eked out a living restoring old homes and building new ones from the raw beauty that surrounded them.

Bart's workshop, a converted barn on the outskirts of town, was a chaotic symphony of sawdust, the scent of freshly cut cedar, and the metallic tang of tools. Benches were cluttered with half-finished projects: a rocking horse destined for a local family, a set of intricate dovetail drawers for a discerning collector in Seattle, and the gnawing, persistent project of his own: a meticulously detailed replica of his grandfather's sailing ship, The Wanderer. The walls were adorned with faded blueprints, photographs of his family, and a hand-painted sign that read: "Bartholomew Davies - Carpenter. Making beauty from wood, one piece at a time."

He pushed open the heavy door to his wood shed, the hinges groaning in protest, and gathered an armful of kindling and logs. As he turned back towards the barn, a glint of something caught his eye in the early morning light, a glint that didn't belong amidst the familiar clutter of his yard. It was buried under a pile of discarded planks, and whatever it was, it was definitely out of place in sleepy, secluded Stillwater Creek. A feeling of unease settled in his stomach, a feeling as cold and sharp as the wind whistling through the mountains.
