Okay, here’s a story opening and setting for you:

**Setting:**

The air in the office of "Literary Lanterns," a small, independent publishing house nestled in the heart of Portland, Oregon, hung thick with the scent of old paper, stale coffee, and quiet desperation. Rain, a constant companion in the city, drummed a relentless rhythm against the windowpanes. Stacks of manuscripts threatened to topple from every available surface, creating precarious towers of unread potential and rejected dreams. The lighting, a blend of fluorescent hum and the dim glow of a perpetually overcast sky, did little to alleviate the gloom. It was late, pushing past 9 PM, and the only sound besides the rain was the rhythmic tap-tap-tapping of keys.

**Story Opening:**

Eleanor Jane Ainsworth, a woman perpetually shadowed by the dark circles under her eyes and fueled by lukewarm tea and the faint hope of discovering the next great literary voice, stared at the manuscript before her. The title, scrawled in messy black ink on the first page, read, "The Whispering Walls of Willow Creek Sanitarium." Eleanor sighed. It was the fifth manuscript she’d sifted through that day, and each one seemed more derivative and, frankly, less likely to sell than the last.

She took a long sip of her tea, the bitter taste doing little to invigorate her. She’d been at Literary Lanterns for almost ten years, starting as an intern fresh out of Reed College, and working her way up to Senior Editor. Ten years of reading, rejecting, and occasionally, miraculously, unearthing a gem. She’d discovered Amelia Blackwood, the debut novelist who’d taken the literary world by storm two years ago. That success had bought her, and the publishing house, some time, some breathing room. But time, like manuscripts, never stopped piling up.

Eleanor adjusted her glasses, pushed a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear, and forced herself to read the first line. "The air in Willow Creek was thick with secrets, as palpable as the antiseptic clinging to the walls."

Another sanitarium story. Just what she needed. Still, she owed it to the author, to herself, to at least give it a fair shot. She scrolled down, resigned to another long night of literary triage. And for a fleeting moment, she thought she heard a faint scratching coming from within the stack of manuscripts beside her, a sound that might have just been the rain, or the whispering walls of her own weary mind.
