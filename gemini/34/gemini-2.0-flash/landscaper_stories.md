The late afternoon sun, a bruised peach color, bled across the manicured lawn of the estate. For Elias Thorne, however, the beauty was a constant, almost invisible backdrop to the sweat stinging his eyes and the ache in his lower back. He was knee-deep in a bed of wilting impatiens, their papery blossoms drooping like disappointed mouths. Elias hated impatiens. Fussy, needy things, just like… well, never mind. 

He straightened, wiping his forehead with the back of his dirt-stained glove. Elias Thorne ran "Thorne & Roots Landscaping," a small, fiercely independent operation servicing the wealthier enclaves of the Connecticut Gold Coast. He wasn’t exactly living the dream, but it paid the bills, mostly, and allowed him to work outside, away from fluorescent lights and the stifling politeness of office life.

The estate itself, owned by one Mrs. Eleanor Vandergelt, was a sprawling Georgian behemoth overlooking Long Island Sound. Impeccably maintained, it boasted sculpted hedges, rose gardens that looked plucked from the pages of a magazine, and a croquet lawn so perfect it felt sacrilegious to walk on it. Everything about Vandergelt Manor screamed wealth, tradition, and a complete disconnect from the reality Elias knew, the reality of a chipped-paint bungalow in Bridgeport and a mountain of student loan debt.
