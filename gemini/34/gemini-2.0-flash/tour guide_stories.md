The salty spray kissed Eleanor Rose Briars' face, a familiar sting that she barely registered anymore. She gripped the railing of the "Puffin Plunger," a name she still found ridiculously endearing after five years of shouting it at tourists. The boat, a bright red and decidedly un-plunger-like vessel, chugged through the choppy waters of the North Atlantic, leaving a frothy white wake in its wake.

The setting was the remote island of Mykines, the westernmost of the Faroe Islands, a smattering of volcanic rock clinging defiantly to the turbulent ocean between Scotland and Iceland. Above them, sheer cliffs, layered like geological pancakes, rose hundreds of feet into a sky the colour of bruised plums. On these cliffs, tens of thousands of puffins, guillemots, and gannets nested, a cacophony of squawks, cries, and flapping wings that formed the soundtrack to Eleanor's life.

Eleanor, a woman of thirty with wind-burned cheeks and eyes as blue and stormy as the sea itself, adjusted the microphone clipped to her collar. She loved this place, loved the raw, untamed beauty of it, and loved sharing it with the wide-eyed, often seasick, visitors who braved the journey. Today's group was a mix: a gaggle of birdwatchers from England, a honeymooning couple from Japan, and a lone, silent man who looked like he'd rather be anywhere else. Eleanor took a deep breath of the bracing air and prepared to launch into her usual spiel, weaving tales of Viking settlers, ancient puffin hunts, and the surprisingly complex social lives of gannets. Mykines might be small, but it had stories enough to fill the Atlantic.
