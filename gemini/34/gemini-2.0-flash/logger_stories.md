Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a logger named:

**Main Character's Full Name:** Silas Blackwood

**Story Opening and Setting:**

The biting wind howled through the skeletal branches of the Douglas firs, a mournful song that mirrored the ache in Silas Blackwood's joints. He spat a stream of tobacco juice into the snow, watching it sizzle and darken against the pristine white. The early morning sun, a weak and watery thing, barely penetrated the dense canopy of the Olympic National Forest. The air, sharp and clean, smelled of pine needles, damp earth, and the faint metallic tang of freshly cut timber.

Silas shivered, even beneath layers of wool and flannel. He was knee-deep in a snowdrift, the frosted ground crunching under his worn logger boots as he adjusted the choker cable around the base of a massive spruce. Its trunk, wider than his pickup truck, rose like a cathedral column into the gray sky. This giant, like so many others in this section of the Blackwood Logging claim, was marked for the saw.

He glanced at the faint spray paint circle on the trunk, a silent testament to the surveyor's decision. Another one gone. Every felled tree was a victory, another step towards providing for his family. But every one also felt like a silent, unavoidable loss. The forest was in his blood, had been for generations of Blackwoods. Logging wasn't just a job, it was a legacy.

But legacies could be heavy things, especially when the whispers started… whispers of things unseen moving in the deep woods, things that didn’t take kindly to men carving their mark on the mountainside. Silas had dismissed them as old wives' tales, the stuff of firelight ghost stories told to scare the greenhorns. He was a man of steel and saws, not shadows and superstition.

He just wished the hair on the back of his neck would stop prickling like he was being watched.
