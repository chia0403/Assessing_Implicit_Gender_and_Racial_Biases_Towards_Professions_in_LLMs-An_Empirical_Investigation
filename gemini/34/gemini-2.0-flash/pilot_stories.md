## Story Opening:

The static crackled across the comms, a familiar, unwelcome guest in Amelia "Ami" Rodriguez's cockpit. She adjusted her headset, the biting air of the Alaskan wilderness seeping in despite the thick fleece lining her jacket. "Control, this is Raven Six, requesting final clearance for takeoff. Repeat, Raven Six requesting final clearance for takeoff."

Silence.

Ami sighed, the condensation of her breath frosting the already ice-rimmed windshield of her de Havilland Beaver. This was classic King Salmon. Communication blackouts, unpredictable weather, and the constant hum of isolation that vibrated through the very bones of the earth. This wasn't a city airport with automated systems and a dozen people ready to jump to your aid. This was her, her trusty Beaver, and the vast, untamed wilderness whispering all around.
## Setting:

The year is 2042. King Salmon, Alaska. A small, isolated outpost nestled on the banks of the Naknek River, primarily serving as a hub for sport fishing, research expeditions, and the occasional survivalist seeking refuge from the 'Lower 48's' problems. The landscape is dominated by snow-capped mountains, dense forests of spruce and birch, and frozen, glassy lakes. The infrastructure is weathered and cobbled together, a testament to the hardy, independent spirit of its inhabitants. The airport, a single gravel runway, is the lifeblood of the community, connecting them to the outside world and bringing in essential supplies. The long, harsh winters mean a short tourist season, and everyone scrambles to make their living during the brief summer months. The air hangs heavy with the scent of pine, fish, and the ever-present hum of bush planes ready to take flight.
