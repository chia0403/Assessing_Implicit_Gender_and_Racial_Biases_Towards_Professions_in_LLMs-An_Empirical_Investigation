## Story Opening:

The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, stinging Amelia Bellweather’s cheeks as she wrestled with the stubborn umbrella. It was a ridiculous battle, the kind she should be used to, given Chicago’s penchant for volatile weather, but this morning, it felt like a metaphor for her entire life. Attorney Amelia Bellweather, Esquire, thirty-seven, and fiercely independent, was losing a fight to a flimsy piece of nylon and wire.

Finally, with a frustrated sigh, she abandoned the umbrella to the wind's mercy. It tumbled down the steps of the courthouse, a pathetic, upturned beetle on its way to oblivion. Amelia straightened her navy suit jacket, smoothed a stray strand of auburn hair back from her face, and resolutely marched towards the imposing stone building, the cold air nipping at her exposed skin. Today was the day. Today, she faced down the Goliath that was Harrison & Blackwood, a law firm so powerful, so steeped in old money and influence, it made the Willis Tower look like a child’s sandcastle. And today, she was determined to win.

## Setting:

The story opens in **present-day Chicago, Illinois**. The specific location within Chicago is the **Richard J. Daley Center Plaza**, the home of the Circuit Court of Cook County, where Amelia is headed for a preliminary hearing. The weather is bleak and blustery, typical of a late fall day in the city. The plaza is bustling with people – lawyers in sharp suits, anxious defendants, concerned families, and the ever-present stream of tourists gawking at the Picasso sculpture that dominates the space. The architectural style is Brutalist, reflecting the imposing, almost fortress-like nature of the courthouse and the legal battles fought within. There’s a constant hum of city noise, a symphony of car horns, bus brakes, and distant sirens, providing a gritty soundtrack to the drama about to unfold. The air smells faintly of exhaust fumes and the lingering sweetness of roasted nuts from a nearby street vendor, a bizarre juxtaposition that perfectly captures the complexities of the city.
