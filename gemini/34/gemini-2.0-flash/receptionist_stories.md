Okay, here's a story opening and setting with the receptionist main character you requested:

**Story Opening:**

The insistent ringing of the phone sliced through the early morning quiet of the lobby. Eleanor "Ellie" Ainsworth sighed, pushing back from the crossword puzzle that had been her only company for the past forty-five minutes. She glanced at the wall clock: 7:58 AM. Two minutes early. Of course.

"Good morning, Ainsworth & Thorne, how may I direct your call?" she chirped, pasting on the professional smile she reserved for the outside world. It was too early to unleash her natural sarcasm, even if the caller was probably just trying to sell her something she didn't need.

A gruff voice barked back, "Is Thorne in? Tell him it's Benny 'The Hammer' Hammerstein. It's urgent."

Ellie's smile faltered. Benny "The Hammer" Hammerstein? She wasn't supposed to judge clients, but that name sent a chill down her spine. She frantically scrolled through Thorne's appointments on her computer, hoping to find some indication that this...person...was expected. Nothing. "One moment, Mr. Hammerstein," she said, her voice a little less cheerful than before. "Let me see if Mr. Thorne is available."

**Setting:**

The lobby of Ainsworth & Thorne, Attorneys at Law, was designed to project an image of established success and respectable gravitas. The walls were a muted beige, adorned with framed prints of classical landscapes that Ellie suspected Mr. Ainsworth had picked up at a discount art fair. A thick, plush carpet in a navy blue muted every footstep. Sunlight, filtered through sheer cream-colored curtains, illuminated a mahogany reception desk that was far too large for the small space. Behind Ellie, a discreetly lit display case showcased various awards and commendations the firm had received over the years, most of which predated her arrival. Overall, the space was clean, polished, and profoundly boring â€“ a perfect reflection of the type of clientele Ainsworth & Thorne typically served: mostly divorce cases, real estate disputes, and the occasional will reading.
