Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a groundskeeper:

**Setting:**

The story opens at Blackwood Estate, a sprawling and dilapidated manor house nestled deep within the misty, rolling hills of the Scottish Highlands. Once a symbol of aristocratic power, Blackwood now stands as a monument to faded glory, its grey stone walls stained with centuries of rain and neglect. The grounds, though still vast, are a wild tapestry of overgrown gardens, gnarled ancient trees, and winding pathways choked with weeds. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth, decaying leaves, and the faint, persistent whisper of the wind whistling through the crumbling stonework. The estate is miles from the nearest village, accessible only by a narrow, winding road that feels more like a forgotten sheep track.

**Story Opening:**

Alasdair MacIntyre, a man whose face bore the map of a life spent wrestling with the Scottish weather, squinted against the perpetually grey sky. The morning mist clung to the heather like a stubborn ghost, blurring the already indistinct outline of Blackwood Estate in the distance. He leaned heavily on the handle of his worn spade, the metal cold against his calloused hands. Another dawn, another battle against the relentless advance of nature reclaiming what was once meticulously tamed.

He sighed, a puff of white against the frigid air. The rhododendrons, once prized blooms, were now a tangled thicket threatening to engulf the path leading to the old rose garden. A rose garden that hadn't seen a rose in… well, Alasdair couldn’t rightly remember. His grandfather, old Hamish, had been the groundskeeper before him, and Hamish had lamented the garden's decline even then.

A low, mournful howl echoed from the depths of the estate. One of the sheep, probably lost again. Alasdair straightened, his aching back protesting with a sharp twinge. Time to earn his keep, meager though it was. He started walking, the crunch of gravel beneath his boots the only sound breaking the eerie silence, his thoughts as tangled and overgrown as the grounds he was tasked with maintaining. He knew there was more than just neglect hiding within Blackwood's fading grandeur, and he had a feeling today, whatever was hiding, was about to make itself known.
