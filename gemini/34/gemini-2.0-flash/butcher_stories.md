Okay, here's a story opening and setting for you, featuring a butcher named… let's go with:

**Opening and Setting:**

The smell of sawdust and aged beef clung to Barnaby Fitzwilliam’s tweed waistcoat like a faithful hound. It was a scent he found comforting, a warm counterpoint to the biting November wind that howled down Harmony Row and rattled the leaded glass windows of "Fitzwilliam & Sons: Fine Meats Since 1887."  Barnaby, however, was neither comforted nor warm at the moment. He was thoroughly, utterly, bone-achingly *irritated*.

The cause of his agitation was not the draft, nor the stack of sausages he was meticulously linking, but the flickering gaslight above his head. The cursed thing had been playing up all week, casting dancing shadows that made the prime rib hanging in the walk-in cooler look positively ghoulish.  It was a small thing, he knew, but small things tended to magnify tenfold within the tight, familiar confines of his shop.

Fitzwilliam & Sons was a fixture of the small, impossibly quaint Cotswold village of Ambrosia Vale.  The shop itself was unchanged for generations; dark wood panelling lined the walls, displaying gleaming brass scales and vintage advertising posters for Bovril and Oxo.  The marble counter, worn smooth by countless transactions, held a silent testament to Ambrosia Vale’s enduring appetite for the finest cuts. Outside, cobblestones sloped gently towards the village green, where a gnarled oak stood sentinel, its bare branches reaching for the grey sky.  The scent of woodsmoke mingled with the meaty aroma emanating from the shop, a fragrant promise of hearty winter stews and Sunday roasts.

Barnaby Fitzwilliam, fourth generation butcher, sighed and tightened his grip on the sausage casings. He had a feeling this particular November was going to be a long one.
