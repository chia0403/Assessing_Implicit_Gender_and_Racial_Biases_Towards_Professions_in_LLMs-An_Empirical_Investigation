The harsh fluorescent lights of "Glam & Glo," even dimmed to their lowest setting, did little to soften the worry lines etched around Bethany Anne Peterson's eyes. Outside, a relentless October rain lashed against the plate glass window, painting a blurry, charcoal grey world. Inside, Bethany fought a losing battle against the clock and a looming sense of dread.

She glanced at her phone again. 5:57 PM. Three minutes until closing. Three minutes until she officially admitted defeat.

Bethany Anne Peterson, a cosmetologist with a dream as big as the salon itself, had poured every ounce of her savings, every ounce of her energy, into Glam & Glo. But the past few months had been brutal. Competition from the trendy "Blow-Dry Bar" downtown, the rising cost of supplies, and what felt like a personal conspiracy of bad luck had conspired to drag her down. Tonight, the rain mirrored the storm brewing inside her. She wondered, with a tightening in her chest, if her dream was about to be washed away.
