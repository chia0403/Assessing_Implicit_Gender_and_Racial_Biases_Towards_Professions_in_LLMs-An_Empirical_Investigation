## The Story Opening:

The bell above the door of "Cure & Comfort Pharmacy" jingled, a familiar, almost melodic sound that usually brought Amelia Beatrice Cartwright a sliver of peace. Tonight, however, it felt like a discordant intrusion. Amelia didn’t even look up from the small mountain of patient profiles she was meticulously reviewing. The fluorescent lights hummed above her, casting a sterile glow on the weary lines etched around her eyes. Outside, a relentless November rain was lashing against the storefront window, mimicking the relentless pressure building inside her.

"We're closed," she called out, her voice slightly hoarse from a long day of fielding cough syrup requests, deciphering doctor's handwriting that looked suspiciously like chicken scratch, and counseling increasingly anxious patients about the upcoming flu season.

A hesitant cough answered her. "Excuse me, Miss Cartwright? I know it's late, but I was hoping..."

Amelia sighed, pushing her glasses further up her nose. Just one more interruption before she could finally lock up and go home to her lukewarm lasagna and a re-run of Antiques Roadshow. "Alright, alright," she relented, finally glancing up. Her eyes widened in surprise. It wasn't a desperate mother with a feverish child, or a forgetful elderly gentleman needing a refill. It was a man she'd never seen before, his face obscured by a sodden, pulled-down hat, his trench coat dripping rainwater onto the faded linoleum of her beloved pharmacy. And something about the way he held himself... something felt distinctly *wrong*.

## The Setting:

**Cure & Comfort Pharmacy** is located in the heart of Havenwood, a small, quintessential New England town nestled amidst rolling hills and whispering pines. It's the kind of town where everyone knows everyone, where the local bakery still makes donuts from scratch, and where the most exciting event of the year is the annual apple festival. The pharmacy itself is a haven of comfort and familiarity.

The interior is a mix of old-fashioned charm and modern necessities. Polished wooden shelves are stacked high with brightly colored boxes of medicine, alongside hand-painted signs advertising local honey and handcrafted soaps. The lingering scent of lavender and peppermint hangs in the air, a carefully curated aroma designed to soothe anxieties and evoke a sense of well-being.

Behind the counter, Amelia’s workspace is a testament to her dedication and meticulous nature. Neatly organized files, prescription bottles labeled with painstaking precision, and a small, well-worn copy of the Physician's Desk Reference paint a picture of a woman who takes her profession seriously. A small, framed photograph of Amelia with her late grandmother, a former pharmacist herself, sits on the corner of the counter, a silent reminder of the legacy she carries on.

Outside, the rain continues to fall, blurring the lights of the neighboring shops and casting long, distorted shadows. The town, usually so peaceful and idyllic, feels eerily isolated tonight, as if Havenwood itself is holding its breath, waiting for something…or someone…to disturb its fragile tranquility.
