Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a story featuring a drafting worker:

**Setting:**

The year is 1958. The place is Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The air hangs thick and heavy, not just with summer humidity, but also the ever-present scent of coal smoke and steel mills. Blocky, brick buildings line the streets, most showing the grime of decades spent witnessing the city's industrial heartbeat.  The story primarily takes place within the drafting office of "Ingram & Sterling, Ironworks Design."  The office is a long, rectangular room, lit by buzzing fluorescent lights and large windows overlooking the Monongahela River.  Rows of drafting tables, each a battleground of blueprints, pencils, erasers, and meticulously organized tools, dominate the space.  A large, wall-mounted blueprint depicts a half-finished design for a bridge support. The clatter of typewriters, the rhythmic scratching of pencils on vellum, and the occasional gruff command from a senior engineer create a constant, low-level hum of activity.

**Opening:**

Beatrice Eleanor "Bea" Kowalski carefully sharpened her lead, the fine point reflecting the harsh fluorescent light.  She hated this part, the meticulous prep work before the real work began.  It reminded her too much of Miss Abernathy's calligraphy class back at Saint Joseph's – meticulous, precise, and utterly stifling.  She preferred the freedom of the lines themselves, the way a simple stroke of her pencil could translate into tons of steel, soaring across the river, connecting neighborhoods.  Today, though, the freedom felt distant.  Mr. Henderson, a man whose personality could be charitably described as "granite-esque," had just dropped a stack of revised blueprints on her desk.  He'd grunted something about "critical tolerances" and "deadline looming," before lumbering back to his corner office.

Bea sighed, the sound barely audible above the clatter of the office.  Another late night, another mountain of revisions.  At least the view of the Monongahela would be beautiful as the sun set, painting the steel mills in hues of orange and crimson.  She flipped open the top blueprint, a detailed cross-section of a stress-bearing beam, and suppressed another sigh.  Something already felt…wrong. Not technically wrong, at least not that her sleep-deprived brain could decipher yet. But wrong, in the way that a dissonant chord can grate on the ear. Time to dive in, she figured, and find the gremlin lurking within the blueprints before Mr. Henderson did. If she was lucky, she could get it fixed before it became an issue. If she was unlucky, well, she could hear the lecture he'd give from here.
