The biting wind off Lake Michigan whipped against the brick facade of the Lincoln Park Dental Clinic, making the "Open" sign swing precariously on its chain. Inside, under the hum of the sterilization unit, Amelia Grace Peterson meticulously arranged a tray of instruments. Her gloved hands, nimble and precise, double-checked the placement of the scaler, the polisher, the suction tip. Outside, the sky was a bruised purple, promising more snow before the afternoon was through.

Amelia, a dental hygienist with fifteen years under her belt, found a strange solace in the predictability of her routine. The rhythmic scrape of metal against enamel, the whir of the polisher, even the nervous chatter of her patients – it was a constant in a life that often felt anything but. This Tuesday morning, however, held a different kind of tension. Instead of the usual pre-holiday checkups, the schedule held a single name in bold letters: "Mr. Silas Blackwood - Deep Cleaning & Consultation - 2 Hours."

Mr. Blackwood. The name hung in the air, heavy and intriguing. Dr. Miller, her boss, had mentioned him briefly, a low murmur about a "complicated case" and a "man who prefers things…discreet." Amelia didn't usually handle these types of patients, the ones requiring extra discretion and, undoubtedly, extra patience. Her stomach churned a little, a familiar mix of apprehension and professional curiosity. It was 8:55 AM. Five minutes until Mr. Silas Blackwood arrived, and Amelia Grace Peterson was about to face a Tuesday unlike any she’d had before.
