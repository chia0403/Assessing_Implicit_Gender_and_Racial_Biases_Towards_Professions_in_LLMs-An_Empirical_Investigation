The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, stinging Elias Thorne's face as he tightened the last bolt on the aerial array. He hunched further into his worn, tweed overcoat, the collar scratching against the stubble he'd been too preoccupied to shave. Dungeness Lighthouse stood sentinel behind him, its rhythmic flash a familiar, almost comforting presence in the bleakness of his current predicament.

The year was 1947. Post-war Britain was a landscape of rationing and rebuilding, and Elias, at 32, was rebuilding himself, one crackling valve and temperamental wire at a time. He'd escaped the grey uniformity of London for the stark beauty of Kent, trading the constant hum of urban life for the roar of the sea and the piercing cry of gulls. He was now the sole radio technician for the Dungeness Radio Station, a job that was both his refuge and his obsession.

The station itself was a squat, concrete bunker dug into the shingle bank, a relic of the war now repurposed for merchant shipping and emergency broadcasts. Inside, the air smelled of ozone and dust, a comforting, almost nostalgic scent for Elias. The room was crammed with valves, dials, and the labyrinthine tangle of wires that he understood better than he understood most people. Tonight, however, the static was more than just background noise. Tonight, the static felt different, almost... malevolent. And Elias Thorne, a man who usually found solace in the hum of electricity, was suddenly gripped by a chilling premonition.
