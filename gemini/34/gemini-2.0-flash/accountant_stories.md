The rhythmic tap-tap-tapping of Amelia Beatrice Plumtreeâ€™s fingernails against the faux-wood desk was the only sound brave enough to break the oppressive silence of the Archive Room. Dust motes, disturbed by her barely-there movements, danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing through the grimy, barred window. The air itself felt thick and stale, clinging to the back of her throat like unspoken regrets.

Amelia hated the Archive Room. It was a subterranean dungeon of faded paperwork and forgotten dreams, relegated to the basement of Plumtree & Hawthorne, Certified Public Accountants, a firm that had been founded by her great-grandfather and some guy no one ever talked about, respectively. It smelled of mildew and defeat.

And yet, here she was, chained to a particularly stubborn ledger from 1987, trying to decipher the cryptic scribbles of a deceased partner who apparently believed shorthand was a legitimate form of accounting.

She pushed her wire-rimmed glasses further up her nose, squinting at the faded ink. The fluorescent light overhead flickered, casting dancing shadows that made the already incomprehensible entries even more illegible. Amelia sighed, a sound that was swallowed whole by the suffocating atmosphere of the room. She was twenty-eight years old, held a Master's degree in Accountancy, and yet, here she was, a glorified archivist, battling the ghosts of balance sheets past. She longed for the bright lights of the office upstairs, for the clatter of keyboards and the murmur of client phone calls. Anything, anything, was better than this.
