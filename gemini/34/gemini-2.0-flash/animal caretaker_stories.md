## Story Opening:

The biting wind clawed at Elara Willowbrook’s cheeks, painting them a rosy, winter-stung hue. She tugged her thick wool scarf higher, the faint smell of lanolin mingling with the sharp tang of pine and damp earth. A plaintive bleat echoed from within the dilapidated barn, a sound that always managed to pierce the layers of her stoicism. Sighing, Elara shifted the heavy bucket of feed in her gloved hands, its metal cold against her thigh, and trudged the last few steps towards the weathered wooden doors. Today, it wasn’t just the cold. Today, it was the gnawing worry that threatened to unravel the fragile threads of peace she'd woven around herself at Havenwood Animal Sanctuary.

## Setting:

Havenwood Animal Sanctuary, nestled in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains in Oregon, wasn't much to look at. The main farmhouse, a rambling two-story structure with peeling paint and a perpetually listing porch, had seen better days. A collection of barns, sheds, and fenced enclosures dotted the uneven terrain, each bearing the marks of age and hardship. Fences sagged, roofs leaked, and the constant battle against the relentless elements was a losing one. 

However, beyond the disrepair, Havenwood pulsed with a quiet, resilient beauty. Ancient Douglas fir trees towered over the property, their branches draped with emerald moss. A creek, fed by melting snow, tumbled merrily through the lower pasture, providing a constant source of fresh water. The air, though often damp and cold, was clean and invigorating. It was a place of refuge, a sanctuary not only for the animals Elara dedicated her life to caring for, but also, in a way, for her.
