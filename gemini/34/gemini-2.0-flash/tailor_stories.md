## Story Opening:

The afternoon light, thick with the scent of dust motes and well-worn wool, slanted through the grimy window of "Finch & Needle, Fine Attire." Ebenezer Silas Finch, his silver spectacles perched precariously on his nose, pricked his finger for what felt like the hundredth time that day. A tiny bead of blood welled up, staining the pristine white linen he was meticulously stitching into a bishop's sleeve. He hissed under his breath, sucking on the offended digit. Bishops! Always demanding the fluffiest lace and the most extravagant cuts, completely oblivious to the hours – the *days* – required to fulfill their sartorial whims.

Ebenezer sighed, pushing the ornate sleeve aside. He knew he shouldn't complain. These ecclesiastical commissions kept the roof over his head and the meager fire burning in the hearth upstairs. But sometimes, just sometimes, he longed for a simpler life, a life where he could craft practical, durable clothing for ordinary folk, instead of pandering to the gilded excesses of the Church.

He peered out the window, past the hanging bolts of tweed and velvet that obscured the view. Across the cobbled street, Mrs. Hawthorne, the baker, was chasing a stray dog away from her overflowing bins. A gruff chimney sweep, his face a mask of soot, bargained loudly with a street vendor selling wilting turnips. A world away from the fragrant incense and whispered prayers of the Cathedral, and a world, he secretly admitted, he missed.

## Setting:

The year is 1888. Ebenezer's tailor shop, "Finch & Needle, Fine Attire," is located on a narrow, bustling street in the heart of Old Haven, a city known for its imposing gothic architecture and deeply entrenched traditions. The street, ironically named "Angel's Lane," is a far cry from heavenly, a cacophony of hawkers, horses, and the general grime of Victorian-era urban life. The shop itself is small and cluttered, a testament to Ebenezer's decades of meticulous hoarding of fabrics, buttons, and patterns. The walls are lined with shelves stacked high with bolts of every imaginable material, from coarse wool to shimmering silk. A worn, leather-topped workbench dominates the center of the room, littered with threads, needles, and half-finished garments. The air is thick with the comforting aroma of beeswax, lanolin, and the faint, lingering scent of pipe tobacco (a habit Ebenezer tries to indulge in only after hours). While not luxurious, the shop is Ebenezer's sanctuary, a place where he can lose himself in the rhythm of the needle and thread, and for a short while, forget the troubles of the world outside.
