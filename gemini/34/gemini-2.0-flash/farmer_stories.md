## Story Opening:

The wind, a restless spirit sculpted by the endless wheat fields, whipped at Ezekiel Silas Finch's face as he surveyed his land. The sun, a harsh, judging eye in the cloudless sky, beat down upon his weathered skin, baking the sweat into a salty crust. He squinted, his gaze sweeping over the shimmering expanse of golden wheat, almost ready for harvest. Yet, a knot of unease tightened in his chest, a feeling as familiar and unwelcome as the persistent aches in his old bones. Something wasn't right. It wasn't the color of the grain, not quite. It wasn't the feel of the air, though the lack of birdsong was unsettling. It was a subtle discord, a whispering dissonance that only a man who had lived and breathed this land for sixty years could perceive.

## Setting:

Ezekiel Finch's farm, known locally as "Finch's Fields," was a sprawling patchwork of wheat, corn, and soy, nestled in the heart of Dustbowl County, Oklahoma. Generations of Finches had coaxed life from this unforgiving soil, battling droughts, dust storms, and the relentless march of time. The farmhouse, a two-story Victorian relic painted a faded, peeling white, stood proudly on a slight rise, overlooking the vast expanse of land. A weathered barn, older than Ezekiel himself, leaned precariously to one side, a testament to the enduring but fragile nature of their livelihood. The horizon stretched endlessly in every direction, broken only by the occasional wind turbine, a silent, modern sentinel watching over the ancient rhythms of the land. Dustbowl County was a place of hard work, quiet resilience, and an unspoken connection to the earth, a connection that Ezekiel Silas Finch felt deeper than anyone he knew.
