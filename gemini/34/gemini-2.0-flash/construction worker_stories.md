The biting wind whipped across the skeletal frame of the new skyscraper, stinging Johnathan "Jack" Riley's face as he tightened the bolt on a steel beam. Rain, more like icy needles, slanted down from the bruised-purple sky, making the already treacherous scaffolding slick and dangerous. He wiped the moisture from his brow with a gloved hand, leaving a smear of grime across his forehead. His breath plumed white in the frigid air.

The setting was Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, late October. The city, usually vibrant with the gold and russet hues of autumn, was draped in a perpetual grey shroud. Cranes, like prehistoric birds, clawed at the sky, competing with the gothic spires of old churches for dominance. The air thrummed with the low, constant hum of construction â€“ the rhythmic clang of hammers, the guttural roar of machinery, and the shouted commands of foremen battling against the wind and the elements. The Liberty Tower, Jack's current project, was a behemoth of glass and steel slowly rising from the city's historic downtown, a symbol of Pittsburgh's renewed ambition, and a constant reminder of the precarious heights to which Jack dedicated his life. He loved the city, with its gritty charm and resilient spirit, but today, even its tough heart felt a little cold.
