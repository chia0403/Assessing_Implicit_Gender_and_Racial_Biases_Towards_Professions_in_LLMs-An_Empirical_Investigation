Okay, here's a story opening and setting, including a main character named:

**Story Opening:**

The turbulence hit without warning, throwing Amelia Beatrice "Bea" Hawthorne against the beverage cart like a rag doll. Scalding coffee sloshed over her crisp, navy uniform, painting a Jackson Pollock of despair across her chest. Through the roar of the engines and the terrified screams of passengers, Bea could hear the sickening crack of plastic as the overhead bins surrendered to the chaos. She scrambled for purchase, her sensible heels slipping on a rogue puddle of orange juice, praying to every deity she could remember from her grandmotherâ€™s eclectic collection of spiritual texts. This wasn't the gentle hop from LAX to Las Vegas she'd signed up for. This felt like the beginning of the end.

**Setting:**

The year is 2042. The story primarily unfolds aboard a hypersonic passenger jet, the "Sky Serpent," belonging to the 'Global Glide' airline company. The Sky Serpent, designed for long-haul, high-speed flights, boasts sleek, futuristic interiors. Think minimalist design meets luxury comfort, with mood-adaptive lighting and interactive holographic entertainment systems built into each seat. This particular flight, Global Glide Flight 777, departed from London Heathrow bound for Tokyo International Airport. The turbulent weather system they've unexpectedly flown into is a rogue 'atmospheric disturbance' over the Siberian Taiga, a region increasingly prone to unpredictable weather patterns due to climate change.
