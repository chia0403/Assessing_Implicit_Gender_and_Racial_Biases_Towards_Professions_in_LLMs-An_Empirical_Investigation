**Opening:**

The ledger lay open before Mildred Abigail Penhaligon, its pages filled with neat columns of figures. A gentle sigh escaped her lips, barely audible above the rhythmic ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner. It wasn't the numbers that troubled her; Mildred found a certain solace in their order, their predictability. It was the nagging feeling, a dull ache in her soul, that this was all there was. Another Tuesday, another set of accounts for Mr. Fitzwilliam's bakery, another descent into the familiar, slightly dusty, comforting embrace of decimal points and double entries.

**Setting:**

Mildred worked in a small, book-lined office above Fitzwilliam's Famous Buns, a popular bakery in the quaint village of Meadowbrook. The office, accessible by a steep, creaking staircase at the back of the bakery, was a sanctuary of sorts. Sunlight, filtered through lace-curtained windows, cast a soft glow on the mahogany desk, littered with quills, inkwells, and meticulously organized stacks of receipts. The air, a constant blend of warm yeast, cinnamon, and vanilla, was oddly comforting, despite its potential to distract. Books, mostly ledgers and accounting manuals, lined the walls, creating a cocoon of knowledge and order. A small, faded Persian rug covered most of the worn wooden floorboards, and a portrait of a stern-looking, bespectacled man (presumably Mr. Fitzwilliam's father) hung above the desk, silently judging Mildred's every transaction.
