## Story Opening:

The stench hit Marco Antonio Rossi like a physical blow, a humid, gag-inducing cocktail of mildew, stale cooking oil, and something indefinably…off. He wrinkled his nose, the scent clinging to the inside of his nostrils despite his efforts. He was a plumber, after all. He’d smelled things that would curdle milk. But this... this was special.

Marco adjusted his tool belt, the weight of the pipe wrench a familiar comfort against his hip. He ran a hand through his perpetually damp, dark hair, pushing it off his forehead. "Mrs. Periwinkle?" he called out, his voice echoing in the cavernous, dimly lit hallway. "Marco Rossi here, from Rossi & Sons Plumbing. You called about the…situation?"

He braced himself for the sight that undoubtedly awaited him. He'd learned long ago that people tended to understate the severity of their plumbing problems. "A little slow draining" usually translated to "a geyser of foul water erupting from the depths of hell itself."

## Setting:

Marco stood in the hallway of the Grand Belleview Apartments, a once-proud edifice that had long since surrendered to the relentless march of time and neglect. Built in the early 1920s, the building was a hulking mass of faded grandeur, its ornate plasterwork crumbling around the edges like dried frosting. The air hung heavy with the weight of countless forgotten stories.

The lobby, though technically cleaned daily by a disinterested maintenance worker named Stan, still bore the marks of generations of tenants: scuff marks on the marble floor, a layer of dust clinging to the faux-gilt moldings, and a general air of weary resignation. The flickering chandelier cast long, dancing shadows, making the already unsettling atmosphere even more sinister. Marco had always felt a prickle of unease whenever he worked in the Belleview, as if the building itself was watching him, judging him. He hoped, for his sake, that Mrs. Periwinkle's "situation" wasn't located anywhere near the sub-basement. That was a place he actively avoided.
