## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The story opens on a blustery October evening in the coastal town of Port Blossom, Maine. The air, thick with the scent of salt and decaying seaweed, whips through the narrow, winding streets lined with brightly painted Victorian houses. Lanterns sway precariously on iron hooks, casting elongated, dancing shadows that seem to play tricks on the eye. The rhythmic crash of waves against the jagged cliffs provides a constant, melancholic soundtrack. Inside a cozy, though slightly cluttered, office above "The Salty Siren" bookstore, a fire crackles merrily in the hearth, offering a stark contrast to the tempest raging outside.

**Opening:**

Dr. Eleanor Vance, Clinical Psychologist, sighed, her breath misting against the cold pane of the antique window. She watched the wind buffet the skeletal branches of the old oak tree outside, its leaves swirling like lost souls in the gathering gloom. Port Blossom, usually so charming with its quaint shops and friendly faces, felt oppressive tonight, its charm suffocating under the weight of the unrelenting storm. Eleanor rubbed the bridge of her nose, the scent of lavender and chamomile – her go-to calming blend – doing little to soothe the tension that had been building within her all week.

The late session with Mr. Harding had been particularly draining. His obsessive rituals, bordering on self-harm, were becoming increasingly entrenched, and Eleanor felt a familiar wave of helplessness wash over her. She glanced at the antique clock on her desk. 8:47 PM. Time to pack up and brave the weather. But as she reached for her coat, a frantic knocking echoed from the hallway outside, a sound that instantly shattered the fragile peace she’d been trying so desperately to cultivate. Whoever was outside was not just visiting, they were desperate. And in Port Blossom, desperate rarely meant good.
