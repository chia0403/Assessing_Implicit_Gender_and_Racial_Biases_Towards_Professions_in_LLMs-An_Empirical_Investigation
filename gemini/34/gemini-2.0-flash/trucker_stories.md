The biting wind howled like a banshee across the desolate plains of Wyoming, clawing at the cab of the 'Iron Duchess', a Peterbilt 379 that had seen better decades. Inside, surrounded by the familiar scent of diesel, stale coffee, and cheap pine air freshener, Elara May O'Connell gripped the steering wheel, her knuckles white. The snow, a relentless, swirling curtain of white, had reduced visibility to almost zero. She hated Wyoming in January. Hated it with a passion that burned hotter than the exhaust fumes belching from her chrome stacks.

Elara, a woman carved from granite and grit, her face etched with the miles she'd swallowed and the stories she'd carried, squinted, trying to discern the faint glow of the interstate signs through the blizzard. Her CB crackled with static-laced warnings of black ice and overturned rigs further up the highway. The temperature gauge on the dashboard was dipping towards zero, and the Duchess was protesting the strain, her engine groaning with each gust of wind that threatened to push her off the road.

This particular stretch of I-80, known to truckers as "The Snowbird Alley," was a notorious graveyard of ambition and frozen dreams. Elara had been hauling timber from Oregon to Chicago for the past two days, pushing herself to make her deadline. Now, buried under a mountain of snow and surrounded by a landscape that looked like the surface of the moon, she wondered if she'd finally pushed herself too far.

The setting was a lonely, snow-choked stretch of Interstate 80 in Wyoming, January 1998. The air was frigid, the wind relentless, and the landscape a blinding white void. The 'Iron Duchess', Elara's faithful but aging truck, provided a precarious sanctuary against the elements, but the threat of black ice, zero visibility, and the unforgiving Wyoming winter loomed large, a constant reminder of the dangers that lay just beyond the windshield.
