Okay, here's a story opening and setting, including the full name of the main character, who is a salesperson:

**Story Opening:**

The fluorescent lights of the office hummed a monotonous tune that echoed the thrumming anxiety in Amelia Grace Harding's chest. Three missed sales targets in a row. Three strikes. According to the quarterly performance review, she was officially on probation at Stellar Solutions, and the air around her smelled vaguely of desperation and stale coffee. Today was make-or-break. She had a meeting scheduled with Mr. Henderson, the notoriously difficult CFO of Apex Industries, a potential client worth millions. A client that could single-handedly pull her from the precipice of unemployment. Taking a shaky breath, Amelia adjusted her perfectly tailored navy blazer, smoothed down her blonde bob, and plastered on a smile that felt as artificial as the plastic plants lining the window ledge. "Showtime," she whispered, grabbing her well-worn briefcase and heading towards the elevator bank.

**Setting:**

The story opens in the bustling, modern office of Stellar Solutions, a leading software development firm specializing in cloud-based enterprise solutions. The office occupies the 27th floor of a glass and steel skyscraper in downtown Chicago, offering panoramic views of Lake Michigan, usually obscured by the omnipresent city smog. The decor is contemporary and minimalist, a blend of chrome, glass, and exposed brick, designed to project an image of innovation and success. However, beneath the polished surface, a sense of cutthroat competition and relentless pressure pervades the air, especially palpable around the rows of open-plan cubicles where Amelia and her fellow salespeople operate. The breakroom is a constant hub of activity, fueled by caffeine and nervous energy. The executive offices, located behind frosted glass doors, are rumored to be lavishly decorated, a stark contrast to the cramped quarters of the rank-and-file employees.
