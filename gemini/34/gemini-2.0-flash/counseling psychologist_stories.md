The rain was a relentless percussionist on the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, mimicking the frantic rhythm in Dr. Eleanor Vance's chest. She took a slow, deliberate sip of lukewarm chamomile tea, the floral scent doing little to calm the tremor in her hands. Outside, the late afternoon light had already surrendered to the encroaching dusk, casting long, skeletal shadows across her small office.

This wasn't how Fridays usually ended. Usually, it was paperwork, a mental rehash of the week's successes and near-misses, and then the blessed drive home to her small, book-lined apartment overlooking the Willamette River. But today, the last client of the day, a nervous, twitching young man named Thomas, had left a lingering unease that clung to the air like the damp, earthy smell of the Oregon rain forest outside. He'd been talking about feeling watched, about whispers in the static of the radio, about the world tilting off its axis. Paranoia, sure, textbook paranoia, but something about the desperate, childlike terror in his eyes had unsettled Eleanor in a way she couldn't quite articulate.

The Willow Creek Counseling Center, nestled in a converted Victorian house in the heart of Portland's Hawthorne District, was usually a haven of calm. Its walls were painted a soothing sage green, and the mismatched furniture, painstakingly sourced from local antique shops, was intended to create a sense of warmth and familiarity. But tonight, the house felt old and creaky, its comforting quirks morphed into unsettling whispers. The gentle hum of the fluorescent lights seemed to amplify the silence, a silence that felt thick with unspoken anxieties, echoing the anxieties she usually spent her days helping others unpack. And tonight, those anxieties felt far too close to her own skin.
