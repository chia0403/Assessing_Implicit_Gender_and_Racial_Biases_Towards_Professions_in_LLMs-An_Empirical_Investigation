## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights hummed a discordant tune, a familiar lullaby to Elias Blackwood. He pushed his mop across the slick, linoleum floor of the East Wing, the scent of industrial cleaner battling a losing war against the lingering aroma of day-old coffee and suppressed ambition. Outside, the Chicago winter gnawed at the glass walls of the Sterling & Croft Law Firm, sending flurries of snow swirling past the darkened windows. Elias paused, straightening his back, his reflection a ghostly figure superimposed over the glittering cityscape. He knew those lights, those floors, better than he knew the contents of his own fridge. After ten years of nightly vigils, he was more a part of this building's skeletal structure than any of the sharp-suited lawyers who strode through its doors each day.

## Setting:

**The Sterling & Croft Law Firm, Chicago, Illinois. Late December, approximately 11:00 PM.**

The firm occupies the top fifteen floors of a sleek, modern skyscraper in the heart of the city’s financial district. The building is a monument to glass and steel, reflecting the ambition and power housed within. Sterling & Croft, a powerhouse specializing in corporate law, boasts opulent offices, state-of-the-art technology, and a revolving door of high-profile clients. During the day, the air crackles with the energy of deals being made and fortunes being won. At night, however, a silence descends, broken only by the hum of the ventilation system and the occasional distant siren. The stark, minimalist decor – all polished surfaces and expensive artwork – amplifies the feeling of emptiness. The East Wing, where Elias is currently working, houses the offices of the junior partners and associates. It’s a place of frantic deadlines, all-nighters, and the barely contained pressure of climbing the corporate ladder.
