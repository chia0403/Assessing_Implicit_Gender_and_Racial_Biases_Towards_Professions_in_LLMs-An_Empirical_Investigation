## Story Opening & Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The rain hammered against the panoramic windows of Evelyn Reed's penthouse office, a relentless, drumming rhythm that mirrored the frantic beat of her own heart. Below, the neon-slicked streets of Neo-Kyoto bled into an indistinguishable blur of light and shadow. She hadn't slept in thirty-six hours, fueled only by synth-coffee and the burning need to salvage what remained of her reputation. The projected renders shimmering on the holotable before her were a masterpiece, she knew it. The "Zenith Tower" - a cascading, bio-luminescent structure that seemed to bloom towards the sky like a metal and organic flower - was the culmination of her life's work. But the headlines this morning had painted a different picture: "ZENITH TOWER: DESIGN FLAW THREATENS CITYSCAPE," screamed the bold, crimson lettering. Now, the CEO of OmniCorp, a man with a smile as polished as his cybernetic enhancements, was due to arrive in five minutes. Evelyn had one chance to convince him that the structural anomalies highlighted in the report were negligible, mere teething issues easily rectified. Otherwise, both her career and her dream would crumble faster than the building's projected facade.
