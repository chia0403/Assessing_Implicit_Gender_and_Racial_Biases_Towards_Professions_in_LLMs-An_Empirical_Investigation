## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The Citadel of Whispering Winds, nestled high amongst the treacherous peaks of the Azure Mountains, was a fortress built on secrets and snow. For centuries, it had guarded the Eastern Gate, the only known passage through the jagged mountain range. The wind, a constant companion, carved icy patterns onto the stonework and howled through the narrow passages, carrying with it whispers of forgotten gods and ancient battles. Inside, the air was thick with the smell of pine-scented oil lamps, damp stone, and the faint, metallic tang of training swords. Banners bearing the sigil of the Azure Falcon hung limply from the vaulted ceilings, their once vibrant colors faded by time and the relentless mountain air. The common area, a large, drafty hall, was currently bathed in the dim glow of early morning, the only sound the rhythmic clinking of metal as breakfast preparations began.

**Opening:**

Sergeant Elias Thorne, son of a butcher and a seamstress, descendant of a long line of Eastern Gate guards, woke with a start. Not from a nightmare, not from the cold that seeped into the thickest blankets, but from the unnerving silence. The Citadel of Whispering Winds was never truly silent. Even when the guards were asleep, the wind – a restless, mournful spirit – always moaned through the ramparts, a constant reminder of the unforgiving landscape surrounding them. But this morning, there was nothing. An unsettling vacuum had settled over the fortress, thick and suffocating. Elias sat bolt upright in his cot, his hand instinctively reaching for the worn hilt of his sword, his heart hammering against his ribs like a trapped bird. He knew, with a certainty that chilled him to the bone, that something was profoundly, terribly wrong.
