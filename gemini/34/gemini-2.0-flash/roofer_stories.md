The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of pine and impending rain as Jasper "Jazz" Bartholomew hauled another bundle of cedar shingles onto the steeply pitched roof. He wasn’t a fan of pine, truth be told, reminding him too much of cheap air fresheners and awkward camping trips. But the majestic, hundred-foot giants surrounding the ramshackle cottage were part of the charm, a charm that had convinced Mrs. Delacroix she needed a full roof replacement, even if the current one was only… well, *mostly* functional.

The cottage itself was nestled deep in the heart of Redwood Creek, a perpetually damp and verdant corner of northern California. Towering redwoods clawed at the sky, their needles forming a dense canopy that filtered the sunlight into dappled patterns across the moss-covered ground. The air was cool and crisp, often laced with the salty tang of the Pacific Ocean, just a few miles west. Mrs. Delacroix, a woman rumored to be well into her eighties and just as stubborn, had lived in this haven for almost sixty years, fiercely resisting any attempts to modernize or “improve” her humble abode.

Jasper adjusted his safety harness, the rough canvas digging into his shoulders. This particular job was a pain in the ass, not just because of the precarious angle of the roof, but also because of the sheer isolation. No cell service, no radio reception, just the whispering wind through the redwoods and the rhythmic thunk of his hammer. Still, the pay was good, Mrs. Delacroix baked a mean apple pie, and the quiet was… well, it was something. Something Jasper Bartholomew hadn't realized he needed until he found himself perched high above Redwood Creek, a roofer by trade and a reluctant hermit by circumstance.
