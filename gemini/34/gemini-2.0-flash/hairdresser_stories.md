## Story Opening:

The salt-laced air whipped through Amelia Rose Bellweather's open salon door, carrying with it the scent of seaweed and the distant cries of gulls. Amelia, her hands still slick with conditioning serum, shivered despite herself. Autumn in Port Blossom was always a gamble; one minute you were basking in Indian summer sunshine, the next you were battling a North Atlantic gale. 

She glanced at the brass-rimmed clock above her workstation. Three o'clock. Mrs. Higgins was late. Again. Amelia sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. She hated waiting. The quiet magnified the click-clack-click of the grandfather clock in the corner, each tick echoing the growing anxieties in her chest. Today wasn't just any appointment. Today was the day Amelia was supposed to show Mrs. Higgins photos of "The Curl Whisperer," her own custom-designed perm rods, the key, she hoped, to unlocking her future.

## Setting:

"Shear Bliss," Amelia's salon, occupied the ground floor of a weathered, two-story building on Mariner's Row, the main thoroughfare of Port Blossom, Maine. Once a thriving whaling town, Port Blossom now relied on tourism and a dwindling fishing industry. The salon itself was a haven of bright, if somewhat mismatched, charm. Walls painted a cheerful robin's egg blue were adorned with vintage hair-styling posters and framed black-and-white photographs of Port Blossom in its heyday. Three antique barber chairs, salvaged from a dusty attic, sat gleaming under the warm glow of track lighting. Beyond the styling stations, a smaller room housed the shampoo bowls and a small, cluttered lab where Amelia experimented with natural ingredients and concocted her own hair treatments. The floorboards creaked pleasantly with every step, and the air always smelled faintly of lavender, rosemary, and the faint, lingering aroma of hairspray. Outside, the view from the large front window offered a picturesque glimpse of the harbor, bobbing with fishing boats and sailboats, a constant reminder of the sea's unpredictable beauty and the steadfast spirit of the town.
