Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a surgeon named Dr. Eleanor Vance:

**Setting:** The pre-dawn chill seeped through the grimy windows of the St. Jude's Hospital staff lounge. The room was a study in fluorescent-lit despair; stained coffee rings marked the worn Formica tables, and a barely-functioning vending machine hummed a mournful tune. In the corner, a flickering television screen displayed the muted chaos of an early morning news broadcast.

**Opening:**

Dr. Eleanor Vance, a surgical resident, swallowed the dregs of her lukewarm coffee, the bitterness doing little to cut through the persistent exhaustion clinging to her like a second skin. Her eyes, usually sharp and focused, felt gritty and heavy as she stared at the flickering screen. A banner scrolled across the bottom: "Accident on I-95 - Multiple Injuries Reported." Her stomach tightened. It was always the same rhythm: the siren's wail in the distance, the frantic calls from the ER, the sudden, intense pressure. She knew, with a certainty that bordered on dread, that her already long night was about to get a whole lot longer. She ran a weary hand through her dark hair, pulled back in a tight, practical bun, and rose to her feet. Time to scrub in.
