The stale scent of lemon polish and despair clung to the air in the Grand Ballroom of Ashton Manor. Dust motes, disturbed by the faintest of drafts, danced in the weak November sunlight that managed to penetrate the towering, gothic-arched windows. This room, meant to be a stage for glittering galas and roaring laughter, felt more like a mausoleum, haunted by the ghosts of extravagance and a legacy long since crumbled.

Here, amidst the remnants of a bygone era, labored Clara Mae Butterfield. Her slight frame, clad in a faded, flower-print dress and a sturdy apron, seemed almost swallowed by the sheer scale of the room. She was perched precariously on a wobbly ladder, trying to reach the cobwebs clinging to the impossibly high chandelier. Each upward stretch strained her aching back, and each descent brought a groan from the aged ladder that echoed in the cavernous space. Clara Mae sighed, tucking a stray wisp of graying hair behind her ear. Ashton Manor. A relic of a life she could only dream of, and now, just another job, another layer of dust to battle.
