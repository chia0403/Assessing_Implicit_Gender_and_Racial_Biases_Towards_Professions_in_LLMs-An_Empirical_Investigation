The aroma of roasting sweet potatoes and garlic hung heavy in the air, a fragrant consolation prize for the disaster that was Dr. Eleanor Victoria Hawthorne's day. Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of her apartment, blurring the already dazzling cityscape of Chicago into a hazy impressionistic painting. Eleanor sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear with the back of a flour-dusted hand. It was Tuesday night, usually a quiet, reflective evening dedicated to meal prepping and catching up on the latest dietary journals. Instead, she was battling a burnt offering of sweet potato fries and the lingering sting of a particularly brutal performance review.

Eleanorâ€™s apartment, perched on the 37th floor of a sleek glass tower in River North, was her sanctuary. Gone were the sterile white walls and overly-bright fluorescent lights of Hawthorne Wellness Clinic, replaced by warm greys, textured wood, and the soft glow of strategically placed lamps. Her kitchen, usually a gleaming testament to healthy living and organized spice racks, was currently a battleground of charred vegetables and simmering resentment. She was a dietician, damn it! A *damn good* dietician, according to most of her patients. But apparently, not good enough for a promotion.
