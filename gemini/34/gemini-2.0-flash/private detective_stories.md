## The Story Opening:

The rain was doing its best to wash away the sins of the city, but in my experience, Seattle's rain only seemed to highlight them. It hammered against the grimy window of my office, blurring the neon glow of the "Emerald City Eats" diner across the street into a hazy, alluring promise of greasy comfort. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee, cheap pipe tobacco, and the lingering ghost of desperation. I took another drag from my cigarette, the cherry glowing like a defiant ember in the gloom, and stared at the photograph on my desk. A young woman, radiant smile, eyes that held the boundless optimism only youth can possess. Optimism that was now, undoubtedly, extinguished.

The buzzer on my door snarled, dragging me back from the abyss of what-ifs that always threatened to swallow me whole. I stubbed out the cigarette, the gesture sharper than necessary, and straightened the lapels of my rumpled tweed jacket. “Come in,” I barked, my voice rough around the edges. Tonight, it sounded even rougher than usual. Another ghost had come knocking.

## Setting:

The office of **Cassius “Cash” Blackwood,** Private Investigator, was located in a less-than-desirable section of Pioneer Square, in the heart of Seattle. It was on the third floor of a pre-war brick building, accessed by a narrow, creaking staircase that perpetually smelled faintly of mildew and forgotten hopes. The office itself was small, comprising a main room crammed with a battered desk, two mismatched chairs, and overflowing filing cabinets that hadn't seen organization in decades. A single, grime-coated window overlooked the street, offering a depressing view of the "Emerald City Eats" diner and the perpetually damp pavement. The walls were painted a sickly shade of green that Cash had never bothered to repaint, and were adorned with a few framed newspaper clippings from old cases – the fleeting moments of glory in a career mostly defined by grim realities. A half-empty bottle of bourbon usually resided in the bottom drawer of the desk, and a worn fedora hung on a coat rack near the door, a silent testament to Cash's adherence to the classic P.I. archetype. The overall atmosphere was one of comfortable disrepair, a reflection of Cash himself: tough, worn, and harboring a secret he couldn't quite bury.
