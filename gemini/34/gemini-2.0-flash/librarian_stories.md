## The Story Opening & Setting:

**Story Opening:**

Agatha Bellweather meticulously straightened the spine of a well-worn copy of "Wuthering Heights," a silent prayer escaping her lips that she’d finally be able to shelve the blasted thing today. It had been languishing on the "Needs Attention" cart for a week, a constant, accusatory weight on her conscience. The faded green cover, embossed with the faded gold lettering, felt warm in her palm, as if holding the faint echo of hundreds of hands that had turned its pages before. She smoothed a stray wisp of gray hair from her brow, a sigh escaping her lips. It was just after opening, the air in the Grand Reading Room still thick with the hushed anticipation that always preceded the morning's influx of bookworms.

Then the screaming started.

**Setting:**

The year is 1928. The setting is the meticulously-maintained and gloriously antiquated “Grand Reading Room” of the Blackwood Library in the small, windswept coastal town of Oakhaven, Massachusetts. The library, a Victorian Gothic masterpiece built in 1897, is a fortress of knowledge, its towering stained-glass windows depicting scenes from classic literature. Sunlight streams through them in the mornings, casting vibrant colours across the polished oak floors and the endless rows of bookshelves that stretch towards the vaulted ceiling. The air hangs heavy with the scent of aged paper, leather-bound spines, and a faint, almost comforting, mustiness. Each of the towering shelves is crammed with every genre imaginable from the classics to contemporary novels and texts. Scattered throughout are antique reading tables, each equipped with a small brass lamp and a comfortable chair. The atmosphere is one of quiet reverence, a sanctuary for the seekers of knowledge and the lovers of stories. Outside, the constant roar of the Atlantic Ocean provides a rhythmic counterpoint to the rustling of pages within.
