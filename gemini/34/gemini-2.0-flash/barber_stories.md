The clock above the cash register, a gaudy thing shaped like a straight razor with flashing neon numbers, ticked relentlessly, each second a tiny hammer blow against Arthur Leopold Peabody's patience. He was leaning against his well-worn barber's chair, a relic upholstered in cracked and faded burgundy leather, staring out the rain-streaked window of his shop, "Peabody's Precise Cuts," at the dreary Tuesday unfolding on Elm Street in Havenwood, Ohio.

Havenwood, population 3,412, was a town that had seen better days. The days when the steel mill hummed a constant, prosperous tune and the air hung thick with the metallic tang of industry. Now, the mill was a rusting skeleton on the edge of town, and the air, when not saturated with rain like today, smelled faintly of decay and disappointment.

Peabody's Precise Cuts was tucked between a laundromat perpetually churning with sad, faded clothing and a dusty antique store whose window displays hadn't changed since 1978. Inside, the shop was a haven of old-fashioned charm, or perhaps, Arthur thought glumly, old-fashioned neglect. The walls were adorned with yellowing photographs of Havenwood's high school football teams from decades past, alongside framed certificates of barbershop excellence, predating Arthur's ownership. The scent of bay rum and stale coffee hung heavy in the air, a comforting but also somewhat melancholic aroma.
