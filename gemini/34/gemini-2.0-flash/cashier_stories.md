The harsh fluorescent lights of the "Mega-Mart" buzzed with an almost audible hum, a constant, irritating drone that mirrored the low-grade thrum of boredom in Abigail Louise Peterson's chest. It was a Tuesday, that particularly slow kind of Tuesday where tumbleweeds of dust motes seemed to roll lazily between the checkout lanes. Outside, the July heat was a shimmering, relentless beast, but inside, Mega-Mart was a refrigerated purgatory, the air thick with the artificial scent of pine and industrial cleaner.

Abigail, or Abby as she preferred to be called, leaned against the worn countertop of Lane 5, idly sorting the neatly stacked coupons. She was a woman built of quiet resilience, with eyes the color of faded denim and a practical, no-nonsense haircut that framed a face etched with the subtle wear of twenty-seven years spent mostly in the sleepy town of Harmony Creek, Ohio. Her name tag, clipped precariously to her Mega-Mart polo, read simply: "Abby P. - Your Friendly Cashier!" Though "Friendly" felt like a bit of a stretch after dealing with Mrs. Higgins and her expired coupons just thirty minutes ago.

The endless parade of wilted lettuce, screaming toddlers, and existential dread that was the average Mega-Mart customer was about to begin again. Abby sighed, pushing a stray strand of brown hair behind her ear. Another long shift stretched before her, another opportunity to contemplate the existential meaninglessness of ringing up toilet paper and cat food. She straightened, forcing a smile as she saw a young couple approaching her lane, their cart overflowing with camping gear. Maybe, just maybe, they would have a good story to tell.
