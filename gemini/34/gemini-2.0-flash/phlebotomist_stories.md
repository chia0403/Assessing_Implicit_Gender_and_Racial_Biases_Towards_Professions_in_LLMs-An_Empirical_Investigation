Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a phlebotomist named Amelia Grace Harding:

**Setting:**

The fluorescent lights of the Blood and Diagnostic Center in rural Willow Creek, Montana, hummed with a weary predictability. It was a Tuesday morning, the air thick with the quiet desperation of people waiting for answers, good or bad. The waiting room was a study in muted colors: faded floral wallpaper, beige plastic chairs, and a worn-out rug that probably hadn't seen a vacuum cleaner in a week. Outside, the wind whispered through the cottonwood trees lining the dirt road, promising a blustery afternoon. The scent of antiseptic mingled with the faintest hint of pine from the nearby mountains.

**Story Opening:**

Amelia Grace Harding sighed, the sound lost in the rhythmic *thwack* of the automatic door as a woman clutching a tattered tissue entered the waiting room. Amelia had seen that look a thousand times â€“ a mixture of fear and fragile hope. It was the face of someone bracing for impact. She glanced at the clock: 7:03 AM. The day had barely begun, and already, the weight of other people's anxieties felt heavy on her shoulders. "Another day, another vein," she muttered to herself, adjusting the elastic band that held back her unruly auburn hair. Reaching for a fresh stack of requisition forms, Amelia mentally prepared herself to be a comforting presence, a steady hand, in a place where uncertainty reigned supreme.
