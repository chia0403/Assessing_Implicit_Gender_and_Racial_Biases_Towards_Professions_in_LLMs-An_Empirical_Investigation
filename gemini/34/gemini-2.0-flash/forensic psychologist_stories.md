Okay, here's a story opening and setting, featuring a forensic psychologist:

**Opening:**

The air in the interview room was thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. Dr. Eleanor Vance, her tailored grey suit a stark contrast to the room's drab, institutional palette, steepled her fingers beneath her chin, her gaze fixed on the young man across the steel table. His eyes, bloodshot and unfocused, darted around the room as if searching for an escape that wasn't there. The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the silence that stretched between them, punctuated only by the boy's shallow, ragged breaths. Eleanor took a slow, deliberate breath of her own, a grounding exercise she'd perfected over years of interviewing everyone from petty thieves to cold-blooded killers. This one, though...this one felt different. His name was Mark, and he was 17, and accused of a brutal crime that had gripped the city in fear.

"Mark," Eleanor began, her voice soft, almost gentle. "Can you tell me again, in your own words, what happened that night?"

He flinched at the question, burying his face in his hands. His shoulders shook.

"I...I don't know," he mumbled, his voice barely audible. "I just...I don't know."

Eleanor knew the line well. It was the well-worn phrase that many suspects used when they were in the midst of covering something up, but as she looked at Mark, she wasnâ€™t so sure that he was being dishonest with her.

**Setting:**

The story is set in **Baltimore, Maryland**, specifically within the **Maryland Correctional Adjustment Center (MCAC)**, a high-security detention center nicknamed "Supermax." The MCAC houses some of Maryland's most dangerous and difficult inmates, and the environment is austere and heavily controlled.

More specifically, much of the opening action takes place in one of the center's **interview rooms**: a small, windowless space furnished with a steel table, two chairs bolted to the floor, and a one-way mirror. The walls are painted a drab, off-white color, and the lighting is harsh and unforgiving. The atmosphere is deliberately sterile, designed to create a sense of discomfort and encourage inmates to cooperate.

Outside the MCAC, the story will also explore the **neighborhoods of Baltimore**, offering a glimpse into both the affluent areas where victims may live and the economically disadvantaged communities from which many suspects originate. The city itself becomes a character, its history and social divisions playing a significant role in the cases Eleanor investigates.
