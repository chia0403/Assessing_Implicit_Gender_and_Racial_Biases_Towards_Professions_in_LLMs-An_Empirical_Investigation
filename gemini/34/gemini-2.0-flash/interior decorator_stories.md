The salt spray kissed Amelia Grace Kensington's face as she wrestled the oversized blueprint from the windâ€™s insistent grip. It threatened to cartwheel right off the edge of the decaying pier, joining the swirling gulls vying for discarded fish scraps below. Amelia, a vision of determined elegance in her practical but stylish linen trousers and chunky-knit sweater, finally managed to pin the document against her chest with one hand while the other secured her wide-brimmed straw hat.

The setting was Port Blossom, Maine. A town clinging precariously to the edge of the Atlantic, once a thriving hub of shipbuilding and fishing, now a pastel-painted postcard of fading glory. Quaint antique shops lined the main street, battling for attention against weathered clapboard houses adorned with overflowing window boxes. The air hummed with a quiet, almost melancholic, charm.

Amelia had been drawn to Port Blossom by the grandly dilapidated "Seafarer's Rest," the subject of her latest and most ambitious project. The sprawling Victorian mansion, perched precariously on a cliff overlooking the ocean, was once the pride of the town, a beacon of wealth and prosperity. Now, it was a ghostly skeleton of its former self, its windows staring blankly out to sea, its paint peeling like sunburnt skin. Its new owner, a reclusive tech billionaire with more money than sense, had entrusted Amelia with the daunting task of resurrecting the Seafarer's Rest, transforming it into a "modern sanctuary steeped in history." It was a challenge that both terrified and thrilled her. Today, however, standing on the rotting pier, the immensity of the task felt less like a dream and more like a nightmare brewing in the salty air.
