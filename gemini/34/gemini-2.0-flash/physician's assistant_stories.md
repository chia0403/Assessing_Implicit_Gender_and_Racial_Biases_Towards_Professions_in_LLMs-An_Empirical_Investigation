Okay, here’s a story opening and setting, introducing our main character:

**Setting:** The small, perpetually bustling emergency room of St. Jude’s Hospital in Harmony Creek, Montana. Harmony Creek itself was a postcard-perfect mountain town, all charming boutiques and breathtaking vistas – but the ER saw the underbelly, the skiing accidents, the hunting mishaps, the heart attacks brought on by too much elk stew, and the occasional bar fight fueled by local craft beer. The air was a constant hum of beeping monitors, strained voices, and the metallic tang of antiseptic, overlaid with the ever-present undercurrent of low-level panic. It was a Friday night in mid-October, which meant the usual influx of weekend warriors mixing with the year-round residents.

**Story Opening:**

The rhythmic squeak of rubber soles against the linoleum floor was almost as familiar to Dr. Eleanor Vance as the beating of her own heart. Tonight, however, that sound was accompanied by a relentless high-pitched whine emanating from trauma bay two, where EMTs were currently battling to stabilize a teenage boy who'd decided to demonstrate his mountain biking skills on a particularly treacherous black diamond trail. Eleanor, a knot forming in her stomach, glanced at the whiteboard crammed with patient names and complaints – a colorful chaos of ailments ranging from "ankle sprain" to "chest pain (possible MI)." Her pager buzzed insistently.

"Vance to triage, stat," the terse voice of Nurse Ratched, a woman whose demeanor made Attila the Hun look like a particularly cuddly teddy bear, crackled over the speaker system. Eleanor sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. Another one. The night was just getting started.
