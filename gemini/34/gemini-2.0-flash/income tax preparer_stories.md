The fluorescent lights of "Tax Time Tonight!" buzzed a dissonant melody that was just loud enough to grate on Amelia Bellwether's nerves. It was late, pushing 10:00 PM on a Thursday, and the air inside the cramped office hung thick with the mingled scents of stale coffee, desperation, and shredded paper. Outside, the late January wind howled through the strip mall parking lot in Waukegan, Illinois, rattling the flimsy windows and threatening to peel away the half-hearted Christmas decorations that still clung to the storefront.

Amelia, whose full name was Amelia Penelope Bellwether, rubbed her tired eyes and leaned back in her creaky swivel chair. A veritable mountain of paperwork threatened to engulf her desk â€“ receipts, W-2s, 1099s, the whole shebang. She was surrounded by the detritus of other people's financial lives: crumpled Post-it notes covered in hastily scribbled numbers, half-eaten muffins abandoned beside tax forms, and the lingering, almost palpable anxiety that seemed to permeate the entire building.

She was supposed to have clocked out an hour ago, but Mr. Henderson, the perpetually stressed owner of "Tax Time Tonight!", had pleaded with her to stay, promising extra pay and the first slice of the pepperoni pizza he was ordering. Amelia, ever the dutiful employee (and needing the extra money to finally fix the leaky faucet in her kitchen), had reluctantly agreed. Now, staring at a particularly baffling pile of deductions claimed by Mrs. Agnes Periwinkle, the local cat lady, Amelia wondered if pepperoni pizza and a slightly higher paycheck were truly worth it. The buzzing of the lights seemed to answer with a resounding, mocking, "No."
