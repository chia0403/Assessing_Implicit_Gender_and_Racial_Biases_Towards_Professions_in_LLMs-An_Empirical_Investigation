The clatter of pans and the fragrant steam of simmering garlic clung to the air in the cramped galley kitchen of "The Salty Siren," a boisterous tavern nestled on the edge of Saltwind Bay. Eliza June Thistlewick, her auburn hair escaping its messy bun, hummed a jaunty sea shanty as she expertly flipped a slab of cod in a well-seasoned cast iron pan. Outside, the late afternoon sun dipped towards the horizon, painting the restless waves of the bay in hues of fiery orange and bruised purple.  The salty tang of the sea mingled with the smells of Elizaâ€™s cooking, a tantalising mix that promised comfort and adventure in equal measure. The Siren, with its weathered wooden planks and mismatched collection of nautical knick-knacks, was her haven, her kingdom, and her culinary canvas.  Tonight, however, promised to be anything but ordinary. A storm was brewing, both outside and within the tavern walls.
