The biting November wind whipped around Esmeralda "Esme" Cartwright, tugging at the edges of her crimson beret and sending a shiver down her spine despite the thick wool coat she wore.  Gaslights flickered, casting long, dancing shadows across the cobbled alleyway that ran behind the Grand Majestic Theatre in Halifax, Nova Scotia.  The smell of salt air from the nearby harbour mingled with the less romantic aroma of overflowing bins and damp brick. Esme, ignoring both, focused on the single, flickering bulb above the stage door, a beacon in the gathering gloom.  Tonight was the dress rehearsal for her daring, and some might say foolhardy, interpretation of Shakespeare's Macbeth, set not in medieval Scotland, but in a 1920s speakeasy.  And if the whispers sheâ€™d overheard from the cast were anything to go by, the production was about as stable as a stack of champagne coupes in an earthquake.
