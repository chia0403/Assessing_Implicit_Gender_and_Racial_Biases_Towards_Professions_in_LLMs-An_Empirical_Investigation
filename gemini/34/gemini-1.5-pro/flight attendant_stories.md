The stale recirculated air hung heavy in the cabin, thick with the scent of airplane coffee and something vaguely floral that Amelia “Amy” Reyes couldn’t quite place.  Fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous B-flat over the hushed murmurs of passengers settling into their seats for the red-eye from Los Angeles to Boston.  Outside, the LAX tarmac shimmered under the harsh sodium glow of security lamps, a latticework of yellow lines crisscrossing the black asphalt.  Amy, her navy blue uniform crisp despite the late hour, smoothed a stray hair behind her ear and forced a smile as she demonstrated the proper use of an oxygen mask for the hundredth time that week. It was October 26th, 2023, and while most people were anticipating Halloween festivities, Amy was anticipating five hours of cramped quarters and lukewarm meals at 30,000 feet.  This particular flight, however, was different. A prickle of unease ran down her spine, a sensation she usually attributed to turbulence, but the plane hadn’t even left the gate yet.  Something felt… off.
