The rain hammered against the leaded windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's office, mimicking the relentless drumming in his own chest.  His mahogany desk, usually a beacon of order in his meticulously curated space, was currently adrift in a flotsam of files, half-empty teacups, and a forgotten, lukewarm plate of lemon poppyseed cake. The comforting scent of old books and pipe tobacco, usually pervasive, was overpowered by the metallic tang of ozone that preceded a storm. Outside, the gas lamps of Victorian-era Ashworth, Massachusetts flickered and sputtered, casting long, dancing shadows across the cobbled streets. Elias, his brow furrowed beneath a shock of unruly brown hair, stared out at the tempest, the anxieties of his patients – a philandering businessman, a grieving widow, a teenager struggling with crippling social anxiety – swirling in his mind like the turbulent waters of the nearby Merrimack River.  He knew, with a creeping dread, that tonight's storm was more than just meteorological. Something was brewing in Ashworth, something dark and unsettling, and he had the distinct, uncomfortable feeling he was about to be caught in the eye of it.
