Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Elias Thorneâ€™s Malibu beach house, mirroring the tempest brewing inside him.  The salt-laced wind howled a mournful tune, a soundtrack to the disaster that was his latest film, "Crimson Dawn."  Three weeks into editing, and the epic space opera looked less like a blockbuster and more like a cosmic train wreck. Elias, a man whose normally meticulous salt-and-pepper beard was now more pepper than salt thanks to the stress, rubbed his tired eyes and stared at the chaotic jumble of scenes on his oversized monitor. The Pacific roared outside, vast and indifferent, much like the studio executives who would be viewing his rough cut next week.  The house, usually a sanctuary of minimalist design and breathtaking ocean views, felt more like a gilded cage tonight.
