The flickering neon sign of the "Last Chance Diner" buzzed a mournful B-flat, a counterpoint to the howl of the wind whipping across the desolate Mojave Desert. Inside, amidst the aroma of stale coffee and frying onions, Elias Vance meticulously soldered a connection on a vintage Zenith Trans-Oceanic radio.  Elias, his brow furrowed in concentration,  had a name that suggested a bygone era of elegance, but his grease-stained overalls and calloused fingers spoke of a life spent wrestling with vacuum tubes and recalcitrant capacitors.  The diner, a lonely outpost on the long, empty stretch of Highway 395 between Barstow and Lone Pine, served as both his workshop and his home. It was 1957, and the rock 'n' roll revolution was sweeping the nation, but out here, the only music came from the crackling static of the shortwave bands Elias painstakingly coaxed to life, whispering stories of distant lands and forgotten frequencies.  Tonight, however, the static held a different quality, a rhythmic pulse beneath the white noise that felt less like atmospheric interference and more likeâ€¦a signal.
