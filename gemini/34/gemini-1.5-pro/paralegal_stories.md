She was chasing a precedent in a particularly thorny intellectual property case, a case that could make or break the firm’s reputation – and possibly her career. The insistent chime of her phone sliced through the quiet, displaying a name she hadn’t seen in years.  A name that sent a shiver down her spine, even as the heating in the old building struggled against the chill.
