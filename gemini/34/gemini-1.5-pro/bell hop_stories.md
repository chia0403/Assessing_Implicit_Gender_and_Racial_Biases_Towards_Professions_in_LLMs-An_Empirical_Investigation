The revolving brass doors of the Grand Majestic Hotel whispered a sigh every time they spun, admitting gusts of salty Pacific air into the opulent lobby.  Crystal chandeliers dripped with light, illuminating the deep crimson carpets and gleaming marble floors. A hushed murmur, punctuated by the clinking of ice in crystal glasses, hung in the air. This was Elias Thorneâ€™s domain. Dressed in a crisp navy uniform with gold braiding, Elias, his name tag pinned precisely over his heart, stood at his designated post by the grand staircase, his posture ramrod straight.  The year was 1928, and the Grand Majestic, perched on a cliff overlooking the churning grey-green ocean in the burgeoning city of Los Angeles, was the place to be.  Tonight, a particularly glamorous gala was in full swing, the air thrumming with an almost palpable electricity.  Elias, usually unflappable, felt a prickle of unease, a sensation as out of place amidst the polished veneer of the hotel as a smudge of soot on a snow-white tablecloth.
