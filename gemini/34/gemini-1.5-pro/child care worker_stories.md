The fluorescent lights of the "Little Wonders Daycare" hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the chaotic symphony of toddlers banging xylophones and shrieking with delight.  Rain lashed against the large bay windows, blurring the grey November afternoon into a watercolor wash.  Inside, amidst the vibrant chaos, Amelia “Amy” Rose Hawthorne crouched down, patiently coaxing two-year-old Leo to share his prized firetruck with a sniffling Lily. The daycare, nestled in the heart of the sleepy, seaside town of Seabrook, Oregon, usually buzzed with the energy of twenty-five children aged between two and five.  Today, however, the storm had kept many at home, leaving the normally bustling space feeling oddly spacious. The air, thick with the scent of playdough and apple juice, vibrated with a strange, almost anticipatory stillness.  Amy had a nagging feeling that something was about to happen, a prickle of unease that had nothing to do with the impending nap time.
