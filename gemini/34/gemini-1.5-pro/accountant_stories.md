The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Amelia Grace Hawthorne's small office, a relentless drumming that mirrored the anxiety churning in her stomach.  Her office, tucked away above O'Malley's Pub in the perpetually damp, cobbled backstreets of Galway, Ireland, usually offered a comforting sense of seclusion.  But today, the familiar scent of peat smoke and damp wool only amplified the oppressive weight of the ledger sitting open on her desk.  It was October, the tourist season a distant memory, and the sky outside reflected the grey, unsettled mood of the accounts within.  Amelia, a woman whose meticulous nature was usually reflected in her neatly pinned-up auburn hair and precisely arranged desk, found herself nervously chewing on the end of her pen, a smudge of ink staining her otherwise impeccable finger. This wasn't just any audit; this was the audit that could make or break O'Malley's, a pub that had been the heart of the community for generations, and a place Amelia herself held dear.
