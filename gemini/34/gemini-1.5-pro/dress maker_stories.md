The clatter of horse-drawn carriages on cobblestones and the distant cries of street vendors drifted up to the second-story window of Mademoiselle Elodie Dubois's atelier.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sunbeams that slanted through the panes, illuminating bolts of silk and velvet stacked against the walls.  The air, thick with the scent of lavender and newly pressed linen, hummed with the rhythmic whir of Elodie's treadle sewing machine.  Her atelier, nestled above a bustling bakery on Rue des Fleurs in the heart of 1888 Paris, was a haven of creativity and quiet industry, a world away from the bustling city below.  Elodie, her auburn hair pinned back in a practical chignon, frowned in concentration as she meticulously stitched pearl beads onto the bodice of a shimmering emerald green gown destined for the Opera Garnier.  This particular commission, for the celebrated soprano Madame Sylvie Moreau, was her most ambitious yet, and Elodie was determined it would be a masterpiece.
