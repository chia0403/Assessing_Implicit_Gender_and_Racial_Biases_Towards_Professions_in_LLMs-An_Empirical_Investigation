The biting November wind whipped around Detective Isabella "Izzy" Diaz, sending strands of her dark hair escaping from beneath her wool beanie.  Frozen raindrops clung to the wrought-iron fence surrounding Gramercy Park, shimmering like tiny, malevolent diamonds in the glow of the gas lamps.  A dense fog, the kind that swallowed sound and stole the breath from your lungs, had rolled in off the East River, shrouding the exclusive, private park in an eerie silence.  Izzy stamped her feet, trying to ward off the creeping chill that seeped through her thick police coat. It was 3:17 am, and the only other living creature in sight was a lone, mangy cat picking its way through an overflowing bin across the street.  The opulent brownstones lining the square, usually bastions of old money and quiet privilege, now seemed to loom over her, their darkened windows like vacant eyes staring into the fog.  This wasn't her usual beat in the bustling heart of the 19th precinct.  But tonight, Gramercy Park held a secret, and Izzy Diaz was the only one who could unlock it.
