The rusty tang of dawn hung heavy in the air, clinging to the damp shingles beneath Elias Thorne's worn boots.  He adjusted his harness, the leather creaking a familiar protest song against the encroaching chill of a late October morning. Below him, the town of Harmony Creek, Pennsylvania, was still draped in pre-dawn slumber, its tidy Victorian houses and winding streets obscured by a swirling mist that rose from the valley floor.  From his perch atop the three-story Gable house, the highest point in town, Elias could see the faint outline of the Allegheny Mountains in the distance, their peaks kissed by the first tentative rays of sunlight. The air was still, save for the distant rumble of a logging truck making its way down from the mountain slopes, a sound as ingrained in the rhythm of Harmony Creek as the church bells that would soon chime. This was Eliasâ€™s domain, the precarious slopes and jagged peaks of the town's rooftops, a place where he found a strange sense of peace amidst the constant threat of gravity's pull.
