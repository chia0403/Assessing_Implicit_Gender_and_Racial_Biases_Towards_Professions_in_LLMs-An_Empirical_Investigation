The bell above the door of Magnolia Apothecary chimed, a thin, reedy sound swallowed by the thick, humid air of a Charleston July.  Eliza Jane Holloway, her auburn hair plastered to her forehead by the oppressive heat, sighed and pushed a stray curl behind her ear.  The scent of sweet tea and honeysuckle, usually so comforting, hung heavy in the air, promising an afternoon thunderstorm.  The apothecary, a narrow, two-story building wedged between a milliner's shop and a dusty bookstore on King Street, was dim and cool, a welcome respite from the sweltering Charleston day.  Sunlight filtering through the large, grime-streaked windows illuminated rows of glass jars filled with dried herbs, powders, and mysterious tinctures. The worn wooden floorboards creaked under Eliza Janeâ€™s sensible leather shoes as she moved from behind the heavy oak counter, a small pestle clutched in her hand. The quiet afternoon promised a chance to finally finish grinding the chamomile for Mrs. Peabody's sleeping draught, but the jingling bell had shattered that hope, along with the illusion of peace.
