The biting Antarctic wind whipped at Dr. Evelyn Reed's parka, stinging her exposed cheeks despite the layers of protective gear.  The perpetual twilight of early spring cast long, ethereal shadows across the jagged peaks of the Queen Maud Mountains, making the research outpost, nestled in a sheltered valley, seem even more isolated than usual.  Evelyn, her breath clouding the frigid air, adjusted the bulky thermal gloves encasing her hands and surveyed the desolate landscape.  Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, a pinprick of civilization in a vast expanse of ice and snow, was her home for the next six months.  She'd come here, thousands of miles from her lab at Caltech, to study the strange anomalies detected in the neutrino readings from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory buried deep beneath the ice. Anomalies that defied all known physics and hinted at something extraordinary, something that had the potential to rewrite our understanding of the universe.  But first, she needed a cup of coffee strong enough to melt glaciers.
