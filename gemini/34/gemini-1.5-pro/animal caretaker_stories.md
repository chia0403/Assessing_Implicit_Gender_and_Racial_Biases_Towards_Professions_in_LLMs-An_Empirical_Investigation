The biting wind whipped at Elara Thistlewick's thick wool sweater as she trudged across the snow-dusted grounds of the Whisperwind Wildlife Sanctuary.  The late December air, crisp and clean, carried the scent of pine needles and the faint, musky aroma of the Sanctuary's resident wolves.  Nestled deep within the Adirondack Mountains of upstate New York, Whisperwind was a haven for injured and orphaned wildlife, a sprawling expanse of forested hillsides, icy streams, and carefully constructed enclosures designed to mimic the animals' natural habitats.  Elara, head caretaker and de facto mother to every creature within its borders, had barely taken a full breath since sunrise.  The first heavy snowfall of the season had brought with it a host of new challenges, from ensuring the heated dens were functioning properly to clearing pathways for the less agile residents like Bartholomew, the one-legged badger, and Mrs. Higgins, the elderly porcupine with a penchant for escaping her enclosure and waddling towards the main lodge in search of dropped apple cores.
