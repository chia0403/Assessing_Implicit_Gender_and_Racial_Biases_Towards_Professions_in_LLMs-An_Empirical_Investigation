The biting November wind whipped off Lake Superior, carrying the scent of pine and iron ore dust and stinging Amelia Hayes’ cheeks as she hurried across the parking lot of St. Theresa’s Clinic.  The sky, a bruised purple-grey, promised snow before nightfall in the small, isolated town of Ironwood, Michigan.  Amelia, her breath puffing out in white clouds, clutched her thermos of coffee tighter, its warmth a small comfort against the encroaching cold.  The clinic, a squat, brick building with frosted windows, seemed to hunker down against the elements, its single, flickering fluorescent light in the waiting room a beacon against the darkening afternoon. Inside, Amelia knew, waited a mix of the usual – sniffles, aches, and the occasional more serious case that reminded her just how far removed Ironwood was from any real medical support.  She pushed open the heavy door, the jingle of the bell above it swallowed by the howl of the wind, and stepped into the relative warmth, the scent of antiseptic and stale coffee greeting her like an old, familiar friend.
