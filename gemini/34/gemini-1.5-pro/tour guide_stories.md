The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of plumeria and exhaust fumes, a peculiar Bangkok blend Isabella "Izzy" Rodriguez had come to both love and loathe.  Golden spires glittered under the fierce midday sun, reflecting blindingly off the Chao Phraya River as it snaked its way through the sprawling metropolis. Izzy adjusted the microphone clipped to her brightly patterned silk blouse, a concession to both the sweltering heat and the need to project her voice over the cacophony of tuk-tuk horns and chattering tourists.  Around her, twenty-two pairs of eyes, shielded by various styles of sunglasses and sun hats, blinked expectantly. They stood clustered at the foot of Wat Arun, the Temple of Dawn, its porcelain-encrusted towers shimmering like an elaborate mirage against the vibrant blue sky.  This was Izzy's fourth tour group of the week, and while the jet lag was a constant companion, her passion for sharing the vibrant tapestry of Thai culture remained undimmed.  Today, however, a strange undercurrent of anticipation buzzed beneath the usual tourist chatter, a feeling that this tour, this day, might be different.
