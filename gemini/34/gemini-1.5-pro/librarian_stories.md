The frosted breath of November clung to the air in Hollow Creek, a town nestled so deep in the Appalachian Mountains that sunlight seemed a rare and precious commodity.  Inside the Hearth & Home Public Library, a haven of warmth and whispered stories, Elara Juniper Finch meticulously straightened a stack of biographies.  The scent of aging paper and beeswax polish hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma that had permeated Elara's life for as long as she could remember. Beyond the tall, arched windows, skeletal trees clawed at a sky the color of gunmetal, hinting at the impending winter.  The only sound, aside from the gentle tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner, was the rhythmic tap-tap-tapping of Elara's fingers against the worn spines, a nervous habit she'd yet to break.  Tonight, the library was hosting its annual Ghost Stories Night, an event Elara both cherished and dreaded. Cherished for the sense of community it fostered, dreaded for the unsettling stories that lingered long after the last patron had departed.
