The scent of sawdust and pine hung heavy in the air, clinging to Elias Thorne's chambray shirt like a second skin.  Sunlight, filtered through the dusty windows of his workshop, illuminated motes of dancing dust, each one a tiny, glittering world.  Elias, his calloused hands stained the color of walnut heartwood, squinted at the pencil marks he'd meticulously etched onto a plank of reclaimed oak.  His workshop, nestled in the heart of the sleepy Appalachian town of Whisper Creek, Virginia, was a symphony of organized chaos. Tools hung neatly on pegboards, their polished steel gleaming, while shavings and offcuts piled in fragrant drifts beneath the workbench. Outside, the rustle of leaves in the ancient oaks that lined the creek provided a constant, soothing murmur.  The year was 1948, and the world beyond Whisper Creek was bustling with post-war recovery, but here, time seemed to move at its own, unhurried pace.  Elias, however, was about to have his quiet routine shattered.
