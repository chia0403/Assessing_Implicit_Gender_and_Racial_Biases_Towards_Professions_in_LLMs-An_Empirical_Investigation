The biting wind whipped around Elias Thorne, stinging his cheeks and making his eyes water. He pulled his thick wool cloak tighter around himself, the rough fabric scratching against his chainmail.  Above him, the obsidian walls of Raven’s Beak Fortress clawed at the bruised, pre-dawn sky.  Built on the precipice of a sheer cliff overlooking the churning grey expanse of the Whisperwind Sea, the fortress seemed to defy gravity itself, a testament to the stubborn ingenuity of dwarven engineering. Elias, however, found little comfort in this marvel.  He’d been stationed here for five years, and the breathtaking view had long since lost its novelty, replaced by a gnawing sense of isolation and a deep, bone-chilling cold that seemed to seep into his very soul.  His post this morning was the West Gate, a massive iron-bound portal carved directly into the cliff face, a single, flickering lantern casting long, dancing shadows across the stone.  It was the most vulnerable point in the fortress, and the thought made Elias shift uneasily, the metal of his gauntlets creaking in the silence.
