The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorne, plastering his charcoal grey overcoat against his lean frame.  He tugged his cashmere scarf higher, the rough wool scratching against his jaw, and squinted up at the skeletal frame of the Blackwood Manor.  Perched precariously on a windswept bluff overlooking the churning slate-grey waters of the North Sea, the manor was a gothic monstrosity of crumbling stone and boarded-up windows.  Ivy, thick as a man's arm, clawed its way up the walls, swallowing whole sections in its emerald embrace.  A lone, skeletal tree, stripped bare by the relentless coastal winds, twisted skyward like a gnarled, accusing finger from the overgrown lawn. Elias, a renowned architect specializing in historical restoration, had seen derelict buildings before, but something about Blackwood Manor, beyond its obvious state of disrepair, unsettled him.  A deep, bone-chilling unease radiated from the place, as if the very stones themselves whispered secrets of long-forgotten tragedies. He pulled his leather-bound notebook from his satchel, the crisp, white pages a stark contrast to the decaying grandeur surrounding him, and began to sketch. The task at hand was monumental: to bring this crumbling behemoth back to life.  But Elias Thorne, despite the prickle of apprehension crawling up his spine, relished a challenge.
