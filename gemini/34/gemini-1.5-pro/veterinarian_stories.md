Elias, his face etched with weariness, hunched over a shivering Labrador retriever, his stethoscope pressed against the animal’s thick fur. The nearest town, Lusk, was a two-hour drive through treacherous conditions, and tonight, Elias was the only thing standing between life and death for the animals in his care.
