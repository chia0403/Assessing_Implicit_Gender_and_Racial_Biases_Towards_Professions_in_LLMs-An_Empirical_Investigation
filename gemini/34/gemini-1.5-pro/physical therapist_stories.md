The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne as he locked up his clinic, Thorne Physical Therapy & Rehabilitation, the frosted glass of the door rattling in its frame.  The small town of Havenwood, nestled deep in the Catskill Mountains of New York, was already cloaked in an early dusk, the sky a bruised purple bleeding into the deep green of the pines.  Snow dusted the eaves of the Victorian buildings lining Main Street, and the air smelled of woodsmoke and impending winter.  Elias pulled his scarf tighter, the wool scratching against his beard, and shoved his hands deep into his pockets.  He had one more house call to make before he could retreat to the warmth of his own fireside, and the thought of the treacherous mountain roads ahead made him sigh. This particular patient, perched high on Blackwood Ridge, was known for her reclusive nature and the unsettling stories that swirled around her like the winter wind itself.
