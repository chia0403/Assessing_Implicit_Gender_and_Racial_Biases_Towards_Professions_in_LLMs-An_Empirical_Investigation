The fluorescent lights of Mr. Elias Thorne's classroom buzzed with the same relentless energy as the late-October wind rattling the windowpanes.  Outside, the skeletal branches of elm trees clawed at a sky the colour of bruised plums, hinting at the imminent arrival of winter in the small, isolated town of Hollow Creek, Vermont.  Geography posters, curling at the edges, depicted sun-drenched deserts and tropical rainforests, a stark contrast to the bleak New England landscape pressing in on the small, brick school building.  Inside, Elias, a man whose youthful enthusiasm had long since been eroded by years of budget cuts and apathetic students, stared at the clock, its second hand ticking with agonizing slowness towards the end of the school day.  He longed for the quiet solitude of his cabin in the woods, the only place he truly felt at peace.  Little did he know, the quiet he craved was about to be shattered.
