Moonlight, fractured by grimy windows, illuminated a scene of chilling domesticity: overturned chairs, a shattered teacup, and a child's drawing, still pinned to a wall streaked with what looked suspiciously like blood. Elias, his breath fogging in the frigid air, pulled on latex gloves, the snap a sharp sound in the otherwise oppressive silence. This dilapidated building on the outskirts of Port Blossom, Oregon, a town usually known for its picturesque harbor and thriving fishing industry, had become the unlikely stage for something far more sinister.
