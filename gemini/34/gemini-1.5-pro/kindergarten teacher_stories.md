The insistent chirping of a robin, perched precariously on the windowsill, yanked Amelia Hayes from her slumber.  Pale dawn light filtered through the floral curtains of her apartment, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air.  5:15 AM.

Rainbow Ridge was nestled in the heart of Harmony Creek, a small town tucked away in the rolling hills of Vermont.  The kindergarten classroom, situated at the back of the school, overlooked a sprawling apple orchard, a picturesque view often overshadowed by the chaotic beauty within its four walls.
