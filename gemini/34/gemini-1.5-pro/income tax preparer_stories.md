The flickering neon sign of "A-Plus Tax Prep" cast a sickly green glow on the rain-slicked streets of downtown Grimsborough. Inside, Amelia Prudence Higgins, CPA, shivered despite the humming space heater at her feet. February in Grimsborough was less a month and more a protracted act of atmospheric aggression.  The only things thriving in this damp, dreary season were mold and her business. Tax season, as she liked to call it, was her Super Bowl. Her office, a converted storage closet in a dilapidated strip mall sandwiched between a laundromat and a bail bonds office, wasn't glamorous, but it was hers.  Tonight, however, the usual buzz of calculators and the rhythmic tap-tap-tapping of her keyboard were absent. Amelia sat alone, hunched over a steaming mug of instant coffee, a single, manila envelope resting on her otherwise cluttered desk.  The return address was handwritten in shaky script, and the postmark was… unusual. It wasn't from Grimsborough, or anywhere else in Ohio for that matter.  It was from a place called Absalom, Kentucky – a town Amelia had never heard of.
