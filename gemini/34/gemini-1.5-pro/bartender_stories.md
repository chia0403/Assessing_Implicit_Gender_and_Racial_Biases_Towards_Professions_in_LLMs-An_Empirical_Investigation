Rain lashed against the stained-glass window depicting Saint Jude, patron saint of lost causes, a fitting emblem for The Rusty Mug.  Smoke hung thick in the air, a blend of cheap cigars and desperation.  Behind the mahogany bar, scarred with years of spilled drinks and whispered secrets, Elias Thorne polished a glass, his movements precise and economical. The flickering gaslight above cast long shadows across his face, highlighting the sharp angles of his cheekbones and the weariness in his deep-set brown eyes. It was a Tuesday night in Port Blossom, Oregon, a town clinging precariously to the edge of the continent and its own dwindling fortunes, and the only other occupant of the bar was a snoring fisherman slumped over his unfinished pint. Outside, the foghorn moaned a mournful lament, swallowed by the wind and the relentless drumming of the rain.  Elias sighed, the sound barely audible above the storm's fury. Another slow night in a town built on forgotten dreams.
