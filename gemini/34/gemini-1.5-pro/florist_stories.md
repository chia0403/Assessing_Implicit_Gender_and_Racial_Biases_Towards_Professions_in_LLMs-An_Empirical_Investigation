The bell above the door of "Petal & Plume" tinkled, a cheerful counterpoint to the drumming rain outside.  Rain, Amelia Wren Hawthorne reflected, was generally good for business. People sent flowers for all sorts of somber occasions, and grey skies seemed to amplify the need for a splash of colour.  Petal & Plume, nestled between a dry cleaners and a perpetually empty storefront on Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village, was a riot of colour.  Buckets overflowing with hydrangeas in shades from blush pink to deep violet lined the walls, their fragrance mingling with the heady scent of lilies and the earthy aroma of damp moss.  Amelia, her auburn braid draped over her shoulder like a silken rope, snipped the thorns from a stem of long-stemmed red roses, the rhythmic *snip-snip-snip* a familiar soundtrack to her life.  Outside, the November wind howled, rattling the windowpanes, but inside, amidst the warmth and perfume of her floral sanctuary, Amelia felt a sense of peace.  Little did she know that peace was about to be thoroughly uprooted.
