The biting wind whipped snow against the leaded glass windows of The Gilded Spoon, obscuring the twinkling fairy lights strung along the eaves.  Inside, the air hung thick with the mingled aromas of simmering beef bourguignon, caramelizing onions, and the faint, lingering scent of woodsmoke from the fireplace.  This was Eleanor Ainsworth's sanctuary, her domain, a haven carved out of a forgotten corner of the Cotswolds. Eleanor, her auburn hair pulled back in a practical knot, meticulously plated a seared scallop, a tiny masterpiece perched atop a bed of saffron risotto.  The restaurant was empty save for a lone figure hunched over a steaming mug at the bar, the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner amplifying the stillness.  Tonight, however, the quiet held an unusual edge, a palpable tension that Eleanor couldn't quite place, a feeling like the calm before a storm rolls in over the hills.
