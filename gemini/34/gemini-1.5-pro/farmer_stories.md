Dust devils danced across the cracked earth, swirling fallen leaves and brittle stalks of last season's corn in a mournful waltz.  Athelney, once a vibrant tapestry of greens and golds, now lay under a shroud of ochre, the victim of a relentless summer drought. Elias, his calloused hands shoved deep into the pockets of his worn canvas jacket, surveyed the desolate landscape, the worry lines etched deep into his tanned face.  The sky, a vast expanse of unbroken blue, offered no promise of rain. Crows perched on the skeletal remains of an old oak, their cawing a harsh counterpoint to the desolate whisper of the wind. This, the heart of his livelihood, was slowly turning to dust.  And Elias, a farmer for all his forty-two years, felt a chilling premonition that this drought was more than just a bad season; it was the beginning of something far worse.
