The relentless wail of the siren sliced through the humid Florida night, a counterpoint to the rhythmic thrum of the rain hammering against the windshield.  Amelia "Mia" Rodriguez, Paramedic, gripped the steering wheel of Rescue 12, her knuckles white against the worn leather.  The flashing lights painted the palm trees lining Biscayne Boulevard in alternating strokes of red and white, transforming the familiar Miami streetscape into a surreal, strobe-lit tunnel. Dispatch had called it a multi-vehicle collision, just south of the Rickenbacker Causeway, with possible entrapment. Mia glanced at her partner, Carlos "Los" Hernandez, who was already prepping their trauma kits, his face grim in the flickering light. The air hung heavy with the pre-storm tension, and Mia could taste the salty tang of the ocean spray carried on the wind. This wasnâ€™t just another Friday night in Miami; this was about to get messy.
