The insistent California sun, already high and hot even at 8:00 am, beat down on the dusty hood of Dr. Eleanor Vance's vintage VW Beetle.  Heat radiated off the turquoise paint, making the air shimmer above it like a mirage. Eleanor, her auburn hair pulled back in a messy bun, tapped her fingers impatiently on the steering wheel.
