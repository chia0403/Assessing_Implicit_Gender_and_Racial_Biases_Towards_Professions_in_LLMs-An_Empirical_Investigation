The bell above the door of "Nailed It," a tiny salon squeezed between a laundromat and a perpetually closed-down travel agency, chimed its cheerful, if slightly tinny, song. Rain lashed against the window, blurring the neon glow of the "Open" sign.  Eloise "Ellie" Beauregard, her name tag slightly askew on her powder blue uniform, sighed and glanced up from the intricate floral design she was painstakingly painting onto Mrs. Henderson’s pinky nail.  The new client, dripping and shivering in the doorway, was a tall man with a shock of white hair escaping from beneath a fedora, clutching a battered leather briefcase. He looked like he’d stepped straight out of a black and white film noir.  The air in the salon, usually thick with the scent of acetone and lavender lotion, suddenly felt charged with something else – anticipation, perhaps, or maybe just the electricity from the storm raging outside.  Ellie forced a smile. “Just a moment, sir,” she called out, her voice a little higher than usual.  Mrs. Henderson peered over her reading glasses. “My, doesn’t he look like trouble?” she whispered conspiratorially.  Ellie chuckled nervously, hoping she wasn't about to find out what kind.  The rain continued to fall, each drop a staccato beat against the window, mirroring the sudden, inexplicable thump-thump-thumping of Ellie’s own heart.
