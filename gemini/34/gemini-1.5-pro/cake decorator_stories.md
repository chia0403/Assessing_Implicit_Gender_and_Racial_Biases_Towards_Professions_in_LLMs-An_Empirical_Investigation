The scent of caramelizing sugar hung heavy in the air, a sweet, almost cloying perfume that clung to everything in the Buttercup Bakery.

The harbor, usually a kaleidoscope of sailboats, was deserted, the boats huddled together against the impending winter storms.  Millie felt a familiar pang of melancholy as she watched the grey waves crash against the pier.  Winter in Port Blossom was beautiful, yes, but it also meant a slowdown in business, and this year, Millie couldn't afford a slowdown.
