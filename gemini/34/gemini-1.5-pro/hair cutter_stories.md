The rusty bell above the door of "Shear Perfection" jingled a mournful tune as Elias Thorne swept up clipped ends of auburn hair. Outside, the November wind howled down Main Street of Hollow Creek, whipping the fallen leaves into frenzied spirals.  Hollow Creek, a town nestled deep in the Appalachian Mountains, was a place of quiet beauty, its charm laced with an undercurrent of forgotten stories and lingering secrets.  Elias, with his steady hand and gentle touch, was privy to many of them, whispered between snips and the hum of his clippers.  The fading light of late afternoon cast long shadows across the worn wooden floor of his shop, illuminating the various vintage barber chairs and the faint scent of bay rum that permeated the air. This afternoon, however, an unusual stillness hung heavy, a quiet far deeper than the usual lull between customers.  The only sound, besides Elias's rhythmic sweeping, was the distant, rhythmic thump of something against the windowpane... something that sounded suspiciously like a raven's beak.
