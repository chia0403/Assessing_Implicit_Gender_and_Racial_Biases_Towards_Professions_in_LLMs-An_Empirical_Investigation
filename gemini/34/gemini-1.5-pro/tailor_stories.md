The rhythmic *thwack-thwack* of Elias Thorne's hammer against his worn leather last echoed through the small tailor shop, a sound as familiar to the inhabitants of Hollow Creek as the chime of the church bell. The shop, nestled between Mrs. Higgins' perpetually fragrant bakery and Old Man Hemlock's dusty bookstore, was a comforting chaos. Bolts of vibrant silk and sturdy tweed tumbled from overflowing shelves, half-finished garments draped over mismatched chairs, and a thousand pins shimmered like captured starlight in the afternoon sun that streamed through the grime-streaked window. Elias, a man of middling height with a perpetually furrowed brow and hands that moved with a surprising grace despite their calloused nature, hummed a mournful sea shanty as he meticulously stitched the sleeve of a velvet waistcoat, the scent of woodsmoke and lavender hanging heavy in the air. Hollow Creek, a secluded village tucked away in the folds of the whispering Blue Ridge Mountains, was a place where time seemed to slow down, where secrets were whispered on the wind, and where Elias Thorne, the tailor, was privy to more than just the measurements of his clientele.
