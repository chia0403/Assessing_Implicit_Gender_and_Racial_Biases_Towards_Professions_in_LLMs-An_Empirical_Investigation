The biting wind whipped across the Alaskan tundra, snatching at the loose edges of Bethany "Bet" Kalinski's parka.  Dawn hadn't yet broken, but the sky held that bruised purple hue that promised a sunrise soon, one that would likely glint off the ice clinging to the massive treads of her D11 dozer.  Around Bet, the skeletal frames of unfinished buildings clawed at the pre-dawn gloom, their steel bones stark against the snow-covered landscape.  This was the North Slope, a place where the earth grudged every inch of progress, and where Bet, along with the rest of the crew at the Prudhoe Bay oil field, wrestled a living from the frozen ground.  The air, thick with the smell of diesel and the faint tang of the distant ocean, vibrated with the low hum of idling machinery, a lullaby in this harsh, unforgiving land. Today, Bet had a particularly challenging task: carving a new access road through a particularly treacherous section of permafrost, a task that required not just skill, but a healthy dose of respect for the unpredictable nature of the Arctic.
