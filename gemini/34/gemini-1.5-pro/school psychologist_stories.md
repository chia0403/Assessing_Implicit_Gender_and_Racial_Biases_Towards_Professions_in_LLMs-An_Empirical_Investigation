The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Eleanor Vance, plastering a stray strand of auburn hair across her chapped lips. She tucked it behind her ear, her gloved hand momentarily stinging from the cold.  Greystone Preparatory Academy loomed before her, a gothic monstrosity of stone and ivy that seemed to absorb the weak sunlight. Gargoyles perched on the parapets, their frozen expressions mirroring the tension knotting in Eleanor's stomach.  This wasn't her usual Wednesday morning. Eleanor typically spent her Wednesdays at the district office, buried in paperwork and student evaluations.  But this morning, a frantic call from Headmaster Thorne had summoned her to Greystone, a prestigious boarding school nestled in the secluded woods of the Hudson Valley. A student, he'd said, a promising scholarship athlete, had vanished. And with the whispers of an unsettling local legend swirling around the disappearance, Thorne wanted Eleanor on-site, not just for the missing boy, but for the potential fallout on the already fragile student body.  The wrought iron gates creaked open as if in reluctant welcome, and Eleanor stepped onto the grounds, the gravel crunching beneath her boots. The air hung heavy with a strange mixture of pine needles and something else… something indefinable… unsettling.
