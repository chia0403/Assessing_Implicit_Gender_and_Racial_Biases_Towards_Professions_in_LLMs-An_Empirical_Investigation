The biting November wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the towering pines, whistling a mournful tune that echoed across the vast, snow-dusted expanse of the Bitterroot Mountains.  Sunrise was still a hesitant promise on the eastern horizon, painting the snow-covered peaks a pale, ethereal lavender.  The air, crisp and clean, carried the sharp scent of pine resin and the faint, metallic tang of approaching winter.  This was the domain of Jedediah "Jed" Blackwood, a man as weathered and resilient as the ancient trees he felled.  His breath plumed out in frosty puffs as he trudged through the knee-deep snow towards the groaning behemoth of his logging truck, a battered Ford F-750 nicknamed "The Widowmaker" for its temperamental engine and the precarious mountain roads it traversed daily.  The Widowmaker, like Jed himself, was a fixture in these woods, a testament to hard work and stubborn perseverance in a land that demanded both.  Today, however, a different kind of chill settled in Jed's bones, a premonition of something unsettling lurking beneath the pristine beauty of the winter landscape.
