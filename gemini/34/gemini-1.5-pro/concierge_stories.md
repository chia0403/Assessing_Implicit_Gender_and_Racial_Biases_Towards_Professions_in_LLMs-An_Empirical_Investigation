The lobby of the Grand Blackwood Hotel hummed with a low, luxurious thrum.  Sunlight, fractured by the enormous stained-glass peacock above the entrance, splashed across the polished marble floor in a kaleidoscope of jewel tones.  Eleanor Vance, her name tag pinned precisely to the lapel of her impeccably tailored navy suit, surveyed the scene with an eagle eye.  A wilting orchid in a towering arrangement near the elevators?  Noted.  A slightly smudged fingerprint on the gleaming brass handrail?  Already dispatched a discreet message to housekeeping.  Outside, the December wind howled down Chicago's Magnificent Mile, but within the Grand Blackwood, an oasis of warmth and hushed opulence, Eleanor maintained an unwavering calm, the gatekeeper to a world of curated perfection.  This was her domain, and within its hallowed halls, nothing escaped her notice.
