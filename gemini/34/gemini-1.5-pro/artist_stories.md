The salt spray kissed Amelia Reyes's face as she perched precariously on the jagged rocks overlooking the churning turquoise waters of the Devil's Throat.  Wind whipped her dark braids around her head, momentarily obscuring the view of the deserted cove nestled beneath the towering cliffs of Isla Mujeres, Mexico.  Her easel, a battered relic of countless painting expeditions, stood firmly planted in a crevice, defying the gusts that threatened to send her canvases, and her, tumbling into the sea.  The air hung thick with the scent of brine and blooming jasmine, a heady mix that always fueled Amelia's creativity.  This tiny, almost forgotten corner of the island, accessible only by boat or a treacherous climb down the cliff face, was her sanctuary, her studio, her escape from the bustling art scene of Cancun just a ferry ride away.  Today, however, Amelia felt a strange unease, a prickling sensation on the back of her neck that had nothing to do with the wind.  The cove, normally alive with the cries of gulls and the gentle lapping of waves, was eerily silent.
