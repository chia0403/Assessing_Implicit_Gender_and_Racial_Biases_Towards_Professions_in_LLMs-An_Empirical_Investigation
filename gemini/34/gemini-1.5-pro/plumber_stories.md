The biting November wind whistled a mournful tune through the skeletal branches of the elm trees lining Sycamore Street, rattling the ancient panes of Mrs. Periwinkle's Victorian.  Frost kissed the browning lawn, and the faint scent of woodsmoke hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the sulfurous stench wafting from the blocked drain outside number 13.  This was Reginald Quentin Fitzwilliam's domain â€“ the kingdom of clogged pipes, leaky faucets, and temperamental boilers. Reggie, as he preferred, stood hunched over the offending drain, his weathered hands gripping a rusty pipe wrench. His breath plumed white in the frigid air, mirroring the ghostly steam escaping from the cracked pavement. He squinted, his brow furrowed in concentration, a single drop of icy water clinging precariously to the tip of his nose. Number 13 had a history, a plumbing history darker than the sludge currently backing up into Mrs. Higgins' claw-footed bathtub, and Reggie knew this was going to be a long afternoon.
