The biting wind whipped off the Chesapeake Bay, stinging Captain Elias Thorne's cheeks and rustling the dry leaves clinging to the oak trees lining Annapolis's historic Dock Street.  Elias, his breath clouding in the frigid November air, adjusted the brim of his helmet, the number 7 gleaming dully in the pre-dawn light.  The cobblestone street, usually bustling with tourists and sailors, was eerily deserted at 4:00 AM.  Only the rhythmic clang of the halyards against the masts of the moored sailboats and the distant groan of a foghorn broke the silence.  A flickering orange glow reflected in the icy water, growing brighter with each gust of wind.  Elias’s gut clenched.  This wasn't the peaceful predawn calm he’d come to expect after twenty years with the Annapolis Fire Department. This was the quiet before a storm, and judging by the growing inferno reflecting in the harbor, it was about to be a big one.
