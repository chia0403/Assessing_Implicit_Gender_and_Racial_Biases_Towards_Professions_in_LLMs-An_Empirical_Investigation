The biting wind whipped off the Tyrrhenian Sea, carrying the scent of salt and brine into the workshop of Elias Thorne. The small, stone-built structure clung to the cliff face overlooking the churning turquoise waters, its single window offering a breathtaking, yet precarious view.  Inside, dust motes danced in the slivers of sunlight filtering through the cracks in the wooden shutters.  Elias, his thick, calloused fingers gripping a chisel, squinted at the rough block of Carrara marble before him. The setting sun cast long shadows across the floor, turning the white dust into swirling pools of grey. The rhythmic clang of hammer against steel echoed out across the desolate coastline, a lonely counterpoint to the ceaseless roar of the waves. The village of Portovenere, a cluster of pastel-coloured houses clinging to the hillside a mile down the coast, seemed a world away. Here, Elias existed in his own solitary realm, a world of stone and silence, broken only by the wind and the whispers of his own creation.
