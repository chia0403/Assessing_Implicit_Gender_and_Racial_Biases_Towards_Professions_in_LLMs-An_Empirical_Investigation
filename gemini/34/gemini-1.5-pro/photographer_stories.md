The salt spray kissed Amelia Reyes’s face, a familiar sting she barely registered anymore.  The rusty tang of the air mingled with the sweet, decaying scent of kelp piled high on the black sand beach.  Dún Aonghasa, a prehistoric stone fort perched precariously on the edge of Inishmore’s cliffs, loomed above her, a stark silhouette against the bruised purple of the pre-dawn sky.  Amelia, wrapped in a thick Aran sweater against the biting Atlantic wind, adjusted the tripod legs of her large-format camera, its bellows whispering like a held breath.  She was here for the light. That fleeting, ethereal moment when the sun crested the horizon, painting the ancient stones and the turbulent ocean in hues unseen anywhere else in the world. This was her pilgrimage, her yearly chase for the perfect shot.  And this year, she felt it in her bones, this year she would capture it.
