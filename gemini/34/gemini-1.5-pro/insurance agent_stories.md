The chipped paint on the "Harold J. Finch, Insurance Agent - Protecting Your Future Today" sign rattled gently in the humid Florida air.  Harold himself, Harold Joseph Finch, Jr.,  sat behind his desk, the weak whir of a dusty fan doing little to combat the oppressive July heat. His office, tucked between a laundromat and a perpetually closed bait shop on A1A in sleepy Ormond-by-the-Sea, usually enjoyed the soothing rhythm of the nearby Atlantic. But today, the only sound louder than the fan was the persistent buzz of a horsefly trapped between the window screen and the glass, a soundtrack perfectly mirroring the anxious thrum in Harold’s chest. He'd been expecting a call all morning, a call that could make or break his small business, a call that held the fate of more than just his livelihood. The salt air hung heavy with anticipation, thick and clinging like the humid haze that shrouded the deserted beach across the road.  A bead of sweat trickled down Harold's temple, leaving a clean streak through the layer of sunscreen he’d applied liberally that morning.  He glanced at the aged clock on the wall, its hands inching towards noon.  The call was late.
