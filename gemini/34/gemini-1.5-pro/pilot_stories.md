The biting wind whipped across the tarmac, stinging Amelia "Amy" Reyes's cheeks as she prepped her Cessna 172 Skyhawk for the early morning flight.  The air at the small, frost-kissed airstrip nestled in the heart of the Colorado Rockies was crisp and thin, the kind that vibrated with the promise of adventure. The altimeter read 7,200 feet, and the sun, just beginning to peek over the jagged peaks, painted the eastern sky in hues of apricot and rose.  Amy, bundled in her worn leather flight jacket and fleece-lined beanie, ran a gloved hand over the Skyhawk's fuselage, a familiar ritual she performed before every flight. This wasn't just a plane; it was her freedom, her escape, her connection to a world unseen from the ground. Today's mission: deliver a package of urgently needed medical supplies to a remote mining outpost high in the San Juan Mountains, a place only accessible by air.
