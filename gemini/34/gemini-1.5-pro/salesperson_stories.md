The stale, recycled air of the O'Hare International Airport terminal hung heavy around Amelia "Amy" Reyes as she wrestled her rolling suitcase around a gaggle of chattering tourists.

She took a deep breath, the faint scent of jet fuel and disinfectant doing little to calm her nerves.  Milwaukee, and Mr. Peterson, awaited.
