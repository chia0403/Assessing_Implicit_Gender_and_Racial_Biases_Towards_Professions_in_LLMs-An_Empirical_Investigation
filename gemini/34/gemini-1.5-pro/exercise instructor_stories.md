A tangle of dark curls escaped her high ponytail, plastered to her temple.  "Come on, beautiful people!" she yelled, her voice amplified by a portable speaker strapped to her waist. "Five more burpees!  Pretend you're dodging a rogue wave!  Use that imagination!"  Her infectious enthusiasm seemed to momentarily energize even the most exhausted participant, a middle-aged man in a faded Rolling Stones t-shirt, who groaned but nonetheless persevered.  The rhythmic slap of sneakers on the pavement, the crashing waves just a few feet away, and Jules's relentless encouragement created a unique symphony of morning energy.  But beneath the veneer of cheerful motivation, Jules harbored a secret, a shadow that threatened to disrupt the carefully curated balance of her sun-kissed life.
