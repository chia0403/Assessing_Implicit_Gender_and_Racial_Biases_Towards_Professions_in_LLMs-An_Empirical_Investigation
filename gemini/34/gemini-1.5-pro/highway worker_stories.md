The wind howled a mournful tune through the steel girders of the unfinished overpass, rattling the safety cones and whipping Amelia “Milly” Rodriguez’s thick, black braid across her face.  Dawn was a bruised purple smear in the eastern sky above the San Gabriel Mountains, barely illuminating the skeletal framework of concrete and steel that loomed over Highway 14.  Milly, bundled in a fluorescent orange parka and steel-toed boots, stamped her feet against the biting January cold.  Below her, the highway snaked through the foothills like a ribbon of black ice, sparsely populated with the headlights of early commuters making their way into Los Angeles.  The air tasted of diesel and damp earth, a familiar cocktail to Milly after five years with Caltrans.  Today, however, the usual hum of anticipation for the day's work was replaced by a knot of unease that tightened with every gust of wind. Something felt…off.
