The rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's chiropractic clinic, mirroring the tension knotted in his shoulders.  "Thorne Chiropractic & Wellness" the frosted glass proclaimed in elegant script, a stark contrast to the grim November sky pressing down on the small town of Oakhaven, Oregon.  Inside, the waiting room was empty save for a wilting ficus and the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock inherited from Elias's grandmother.  He rubbed his hands together, the faint scent of antiseptic clinging to his skin.  Oakhaven, nestled deep in the Willamette Valley, was typically a place of quiet, predictable routines. But tonight, something felt distinctly off.  A cold dread, heavier than the downpour outside, settled in Elias’s stomach. He’d treated Mrs. Henderson’s stiff neck earlier, rescheduled Mr. Davies’s appointment due to a fishing trip, and locked up promptly at 6:00 pm, just like every other Tuesday.  So why, as he reached for his coat, did he have the unsettling feeling he wasn't alone?
