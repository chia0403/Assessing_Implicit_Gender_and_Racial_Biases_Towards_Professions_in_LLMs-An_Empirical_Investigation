The flickering neon sign of "The Binary Bean" cast a lurid green glow across Amelia “Mia” Sharma’s tired face.

Tonight, however, the usual hum of the city felt different, charged with a nervous energy that mirrored her own.  Mia pushed a stray strand of dark hair out of her eyes, the glow of the screen reflecting in her worried gaze.

It contained only a single line of code, a seemingly random string of characters, but Mia knew, with a chilling certainty, that it was anything but random.  It was a key, and she had a sinking feeling it unlocked something dangerous.
