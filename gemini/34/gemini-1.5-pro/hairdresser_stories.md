The flickering neon sign of "Shear Brilliance" cast a lavender glow over the perpetually damp pavement of Grimshaw Lane. Rain, a Grimshaw staple, hammered against the salon's large bay window, blurring the reflection of Amelia Rose Hawthorne meticulously arranging a display of volumizing mousses. Inside, the air hummed with the low thrum of hairdryers and the rhythmic snip of Amelia's shears, a soundtrack she'd known since she was a child, growing up above the very salon she now owned. The scent of perms and hairspray mingled with the sweet aroma of the chamomile tea Amelia perpetually sipped, a small comfort against the chill that permeated even the warmest corners of this small, seaside town.  The bell above the door chimed, announcing a customer, and Amelia plastered on her warmest smile, ready to transform another Grimshaw resident with her particular brand of hairdressing magic.
