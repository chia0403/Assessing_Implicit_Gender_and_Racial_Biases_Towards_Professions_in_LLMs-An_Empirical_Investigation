The pungent scent of acetone hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume that Genevieve "Gigi" Dubois barely registered anymore.  Her salon, "Gigi's Glamarama," nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed-down Italian restaurant in the faded glory of downtown Astoria, Oregon, was a riot of colour.  Flamingo pink walls clashed cheerfully with zebra-striped chairs, while a disco ball suspended from the water-damaged ceiling scattered fractured rainbows across the worn linoleum floor. Outside, a grey November drizzle plastered rain-slicked leaves against the window, obscuring the view of the sullen Columbia River beyond.  This Tuesday morning was slow, the kind of slow that allowed Gigi to meticulously arrange her collection of glitter polishes in a spectrum from holographic emerald to iridescent periwinkle.  She hummed softly along to the eighties power ballads blasting from the tiny radio perched on a shelf crammed with curling irons, blissfully unaware that a storm of a different kind was about to blow through her door.
