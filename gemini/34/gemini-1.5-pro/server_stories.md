The stale, buttery scent of movie theatre popcorn clung to Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez like a second skin.  It permeated her hair, her clothes, even, she suspected, her pores.  Not that she minded.

The premiere of "Galaxy's End: Retribution," the most hyped space opera in decades, was about to begin, and the lobby of the Majestic thrummed with a restless energy that echoed the rumbling bass emanating from behind the double doors of Theatre One.  Amy, balancing a precarious tower of extra-large sodas on a plastic tray, navigated the throng of eager moviegoers with practiced ease, her eyes scanning the crowd for any spilled drinks or discarded popcorn buckets that threatened the delicate ecosystem of controlled chaos.
