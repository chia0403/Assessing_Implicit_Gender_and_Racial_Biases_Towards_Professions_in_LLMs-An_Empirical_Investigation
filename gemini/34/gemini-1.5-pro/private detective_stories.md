Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of Amelia "Amy" Dubois's office, a staccato rhythm accompanying the mournful wail of a distant foghorn. The air inside, thick with the smell of stale coffee and cheap cigarettes, offered little comfort from the San Francisco chill.  Her office, sandwiched between a pawn shop and a perpetually closed fortune teller's parlor on a forgotten stretch of Mission Street, wasn't much to look at.  Peeling paint clung to the walls like a second skin, and the single bare bulb hanging precariously from the ceiling cast long, distorted shadows that danced with the flickering neon sign outside. Amy, her chin propped on a hand, stared out the rain-streaked window at the blurred cityscape, a half-eaten tuna sandwich and a lukewarm cup of coffee her only companions.  The clock above the door ticked with agonizing slowness, each tick a tiny hammer blow against the silence.  It was the kind of November night that seeped into your bones and stayed there, a damp, unwelcome guest.
