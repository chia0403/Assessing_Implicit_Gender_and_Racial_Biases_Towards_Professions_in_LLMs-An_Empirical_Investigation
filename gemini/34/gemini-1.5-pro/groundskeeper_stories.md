The biting November wind whipped at Elias Thorne's threadbare coat as he surveyed his domain.  Wysteria Hall loomed behind him, a gothic monstrosity of grey stone and leaded glass, its many windows reflecting the bruised twilight sky.  Dead leaves skittered across the manicured lawns, chasing each other like giggling ghosts.  Elias, head groundskeeper for the past fifteen years, knew every inch of the ten-acre estate â€“ from the gnarled roots of the ancient oak by the west gate to the delicate, frost-kissed petals of the late-blooming chrysanthemums bordering the reflecting pool.  This evening, however, a peculiar stillness hung in the air, a silence deeper than the usual hush before nightfall. It prickled the hairs on the back of his neck and settled like a stone in the pit of his stomach. Something wasn't right.
