The biting November wind whipped around Eleanor Vance, plastering stray strands of auburn hair across her lipstick-smudged mouth. She tugged her cashmere scarf tighter, its peony pink a stark contrast to the greystone facade of the Hawthorne House, looming before her like a gothic behemoth.  Built in 1888, the house sat on a windswept bluff overlooking the churning Atlantic just outside the quaint, tourist-trap town of Port Blossom, Maine.  Eleanor, a Boston-based interior decorator known for her bold use of colour and her uncanny ability to blend modern sensibilities with classic architecture, had been summoned to breathe life back into the Hawthorne House's dusty, forgotten rooms.  Rumour had it the house had stood empty for decades, shrouded in local whispers of eccentric previous owners and unexplained occurrences. But Eleanor, armed with paint swatches, fabric samples, and an unwavering belief in the transformative power of good design, wasn't easily deterred by ghostly tales.  This house, she decided, staring up at its darkened windows, was about to become her masterpiece.
