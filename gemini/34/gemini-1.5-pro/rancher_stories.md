The wind, sharp and smelling of impending snow, whipped across the Montana plains, biting at the exposed skin of Jedediah "Jed" Callahan.  He squinted against the grey sky, his weathered face a roadmap of sun and worry lines.  The Bar-C Ranch, nestled in the shadow of the jagged peaks of the Crazy Mountains, sprawled out before him, a patchwork of browns and greens stitched together by miles of  fences that groaned under the wind's relentless assault.  November had arrived like a fist, bringing with it the promise of a brutal winter, and Jed knew in his gut this one would test him and his ranch like never before. The cattle were restless, lowing nervously in the holding pens, sensing the shift in the air.  The normally boisterous ravens that circled the ranch house were silent, huddled together on the gnarled branches of a lone cottonwood, their black feathers ruffled against the cold.  This was Jed's kingdom, his legacy, passed down through generations of Callahans, and he felt the weight of it heavy on his shoulders as he surveyed his land, bracing for the coming storm.
