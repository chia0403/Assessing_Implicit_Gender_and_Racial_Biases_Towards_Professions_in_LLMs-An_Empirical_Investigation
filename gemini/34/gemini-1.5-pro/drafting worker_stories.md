The fluorescent lights of Henderson & Sons Architectural Design hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic scratch of graphite on vellum. Elias Thorne, his name neatly printed in the bottom right corner of the blueprint spread across his drafting table, squinted at the intricate network of lines. Dust motes danced in the cone of light from his adjustable lamp, illuminating the precise details of a proposed extension to the Blackwood Manor. Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the redbrick buildings of downtown Philadelphia, hinting at the approaching chill of a November evening.  The air in the drafting room, thick with the scent of pencil shavings and stale coffee, hung heavy and still, broken only by the occasional sigh or the rustle of tracing paper.  Elias, a young man with perpetually tired eyes and ink-stained fingertips, pushed a stray lock of dark hair from his forehead and leaned closer to the drawing, his focus absolute. He had poured weeks into this design, meticulously crafting every arch and cornice, every window and doorway.  Blackwood Manor was his chance, his opportunity to finally prove himself beyond the mundane drafting work he'd been assigned since joining the firm.
