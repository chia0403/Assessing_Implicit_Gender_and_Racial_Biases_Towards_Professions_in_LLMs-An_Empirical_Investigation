The fluorescent lights of Northwood High hummed a monotonous B-flat, a soundtrack that Amelia Reyes, the school's guidance counselor, had grown accustomed to over her fifteen years at the institution.  Her office, tucked away in a quiet corner near the library, was a comforting chaos of student artwork, motivational posters featuring kittens clinging precariously to branches, and overflowing bookshelves.  October in the Catskill Mountains meant the leaves outside were transforming into a vibrant tapestry of reds, oranges, and yellows, a stark contrast to the muted beige walls of Northwood.  This particular Monday, however, the usual autumnal peace was shattered by the insistent ringing of Amelia's phone, followed by the frantic voice of Principal Thompson. A student had been found unconscious in the woods bordering the school grounds, and Amelia's expertise was urgently needed.
