The rusty diner sign, shaped like a coffee pot perpetually pouring, buzzed against the pre-dawn chill.  Patches of ice clung stubbornly to the asphalt of the Flying J truck stop, reflecting the neon glow in fractured, shimmering shards.  Inside, the air hung thick with the aroma of burnt coffee and frying bacon, a greasy blanket draped over the low hum of conversation and the clatter of cutlery.  This was Amelia "Amy" Rose Carter's domain, or at least, one of many she frequented in her nomadic existence.  Her eighteen-wheeler, a behemoth christened "The Wanderer" and adorned with a faded American flag decal, sat idling in the furthest corner of the lot, its twin exhaust pipes puffing out plumes of white into the inky blackness. Amy, bundled in a thick flannel shirt and a worn denim jacket, nursed a lukewarm mug of coffee, staring out at the desolate expanse of Nevada highway stretching before her.  Dawn hadn't yet broken over the mountains that clawed at the horizon, leaving the world painted in shades of grey and deep, unforgiving blue.  Another long haul stretched ahead, promising miles of empty road, crackling CB radio chatter, and the lonely comfort of the open road.
