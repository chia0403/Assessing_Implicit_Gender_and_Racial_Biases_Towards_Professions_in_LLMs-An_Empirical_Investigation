The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful song around Captain Evelyn "Evie" Reed's battered Cessna 185, rattling the single propeller like a loose tooth.  Below, the Chugach Mountains clawed at the bruised twilight sky, their snow-laden peaks etched in stark relief against the fading light.  Evie squinted through the frosted cockpit window, the landscape a breathtaking, yet unforgiving, panorama of jagged peaks and frozen valleys.  The air was thick with the scent of pine and impending snow, a familiar fragrance that held both comfort and a hint of danger.  She checked her instruments one last time, the familiar glow of the dials a reassuring presence in the encroaching darkness.  Tonight's flight was personal, a dangerous shortcut across the treacherous terrain, fuelled by a desperate need and a prayer whispered to the unforgiving wilderness.
