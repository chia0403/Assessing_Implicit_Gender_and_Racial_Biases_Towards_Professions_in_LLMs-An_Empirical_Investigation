The midday sun beat down on the dusty, terracotta-tiled roofs of San Miguel de Allende, baking the already sweltering air.  Dr. Eleanor Vance, DDS, wiped a bead of sweat from her brow, the scent of hibiscus and roasting chiles doing little to alleviate the oppressive heat.  Her small, charming dental practice, "Sonrisas de Allende" – Smiles of Allende – was tucked away on a quiet cobblestone street, its whitewashed walls barely visible behind a riot of bougainvillea.  The rhythmic clang of the blacksmith’s hammer from a nearby plaza competed with the chirping of cicadas and the distant, lilting strains of mariachi music.  Inside, the air conditioning hummed a welcome counterpoint to the outside world, a cool sanctuary offering respite from the relentless Mexican sun.  Eleanor, however, felt anything but serene.  A particularly challenging extraction awaited her, and not just any extraction – this one involved Señor Dominguez, the notoriously stubborn owner of the town’s most popular cantina.
