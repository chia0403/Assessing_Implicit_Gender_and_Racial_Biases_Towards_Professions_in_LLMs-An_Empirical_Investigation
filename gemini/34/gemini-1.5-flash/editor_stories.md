The chipped mug warmed Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s hands, the lukewarm tea doing little to chase away the November chill that clung to the bones of her Victorian office. Rain lashed against the tall, arched windows of Blackwood & Sons Publishing, blurring the gaslight-streaked streets of London into a hazy watercolour.  Amelia, a woman whose sharp wit was only surpassed by her even sharper eye for a misplaced comma, stared out at the storm, a frown etching itself onto her already weary face.  The manuscript lay abandoned on her desk, a thick tome titled *The Serpent's Kiss*, its gilded lettering mocking her lack of progress.  It wasn't the writing that troubled her – it was the author, a reclusive poet named Silas Blackwood, whose cryptic notes and even more cryptic behaviour threatened to unravel the already fragile deadline.  The scent of old paper and damp wool hung heavy in the air, a fitting atmosphere for the literary tempest brewing within the walls of Blackwood & Sons.
