The chipped porcelain mug warmed Dr. Eleanor Vanceâ€™s hands, the lukewarm chamomile tea doing little to soothe the icy knot in her stomach.  Rain lashed against the tall, gothic windows of her office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  Her practice, nestled on the third floor of a converted Victorian building in the heart of rain-slicked Savannah, Georgia, usually offered a haven of calm.  Tonight, however, the antique oak desk felt less like a sanctuary and more like a judge's gavel, poised to condemn her to a night of restless, self-flagellating thoughts.  The scent of jasmine, usually a comforting presence from the overflowing window boxes, was lost in the overwhelming aroma of damp earth and impending storm.  Outside, Spanish moss draped from ancient live oaks like mournful widows, swaying in the wind.  Inside, Eleanor Vance, a counseling psychologist known for her calm demeanor and insightful empathy, was anything but composed.
