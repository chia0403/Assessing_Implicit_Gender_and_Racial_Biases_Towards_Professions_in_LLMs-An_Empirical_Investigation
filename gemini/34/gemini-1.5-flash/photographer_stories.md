The salt spray kissed Elias Thorne's face, stinging his eyes as he wrestled with his tripod on the wind-whipped cliffs of Dún Chaoin.  Below, the Atlantic Ocean roared, a restless beast churning emerald and sapphire against the jagged coastline of County Kerry, Ireland.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and wild gorse, whipped Elias's dark hair across his forehead, but he barely registered it.  His focus was entirely on the dramatic light – a bruised purple sky bleeding into a fiery orange horizon, promising a spectacular sunset, the kind that photographers dreamt of capturing but rarely did.  His battered Nikon, usually a reassuring weight in his hands, felt almost insignificant against the raw power of nature unfolding before him.  This was it, the culmination of a year spent chasing the elusive 'Green Flash', a fleeting optical phenomenon said to appear only at the precise moment the sun dipped below the horizon.  Elias Thorne, landscape photographer extraordinaire, was determined to be the one to capture it.
