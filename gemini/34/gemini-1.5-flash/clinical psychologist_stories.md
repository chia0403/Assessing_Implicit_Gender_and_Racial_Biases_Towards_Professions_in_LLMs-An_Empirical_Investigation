The chipped porcelain mug warmed Dr. Eleanor Vance’s hands, a small comfort against the biting November wind whistling through the gaps in the old Victorian windows of her office.  Rain lashed against the panes, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  Her consulting room, tucked away on the third floor of a rambling building overlooking the perpetually grey expanse of the North Sea, smelled faintly of dust, old books, and the lingering scent of sandalwood incense – a futile attempt to mask the underlying dampness that seemed to seep from the very foundations.  Eleanor, a clinical psychologist specializing in trauma and grief, stared out at the churning water, her reflection a pale ghost in the murky glass.  The storm outside was nothing compared to the one raging within the walls of her next appointment – the storm that was Elias Thorne.
