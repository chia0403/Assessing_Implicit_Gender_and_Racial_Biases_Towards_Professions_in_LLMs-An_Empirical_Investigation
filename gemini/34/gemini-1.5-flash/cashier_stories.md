The fluorescent lights of "Quick Stop Mart" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Elara Vance's evening.  Elara, all sharp angles and tired eyes beneath a messy bun, leaned against the chipped Formica counter, the plastic smell of the air freshener battling the lingering scent of stale coffee and something vaguelyâ€¦fishy. Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the already indistinct neon signs of the surrounding strip mall into shimmering, indistinct streaks.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful ballad, rattling the already loose window frames, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *beep* of the scanner as Elara tallied another customer's surprisingly hefty grocery bill.  It was Tuesday.  Another Tuesday in the purgatory of the Quick Stop Mart, and Elara was already counting down the minutes until her shift ended.
