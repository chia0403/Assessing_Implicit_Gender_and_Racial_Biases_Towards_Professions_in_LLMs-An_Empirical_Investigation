The chipped paint of the "Welcome to Oakhaven Elementary" sign flaked onto Dr. Eleanor Vance's sensible brown shoes as a gust of wind, smelling faintly of woodsmoke and damp earth, whipped past her.  October in Oakhaven, Vermont, always felt like a prelude to something â€“ something unsettling, something hidden beneath the vibrant tapestry of autumn leaves.  Eleanor, a school psychologist with a penchant for sensible shoes and an even stronger penchant for unraveling the knotted anxieties of children, adjusted her scarf against the biting chill.  The school, a rambling brick structure that looked perpetually on the verge of settling further into the hillside, loomed before her, a silent, brick sentinel guarding its secrets within.  This wasn't just any Tuesday morning; a particularly disturbing incident had occurred the previous day, an incident that had left a ripple of unease washing over the normally placid community, leaving Eleanor with a knot of her own in her stomach, a knot far tighter than any she'd encountered in her years of practice.
