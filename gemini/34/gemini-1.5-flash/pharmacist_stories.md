Dust motes, illuminated by the single, sputtering gas lamp above, danced in the air like mischievous sprites in the cramped, cluttered back room of Thorne's Pharmacy.  The scent of dried herbs, clinging stubbornly to the aged wooden shelves, mingled with the sharp, medicinal aroma of crushed valerian root and the faintly sweet perfume of chamomile – a comforting, familiar symphony that had been the soundtrack to Elias’s life for as long as he could remember.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune against the leaded-glass windows of the shop, a stark contrast to the quiet, almost reverent stillness within.  This was where Elias, a pharmacist of impeccable reputation (and, some whispered, questionable methods), spent his nights, surrounded by the potent secrets held within his carefully curated collection of remedies, poisons, and forgotten lore.
