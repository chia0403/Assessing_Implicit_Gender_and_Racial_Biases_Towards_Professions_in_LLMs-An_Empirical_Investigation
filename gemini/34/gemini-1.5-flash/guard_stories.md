The biting wind whipped at Sergeant Valerius Thorneâ€™s cloak, a ragged thing of once-fine wool, now more patched than whole.  He pulled the collar higher, the rough fabric scratching against his chapped cheek.  The flickering torchlight of the Obsidian Gate cast long, dancing shadows across the cobblestones, highlighting the grim, grey stone that formed the city walls of Porthaven.  Rain, sleeting now, plastered his dark hair to his forehead, and the damp chill seeped into his very bones.  Beyond the gate, the endless, storm-tossed expanse of the Whisperwind Sea churned under a bruised, twilight sky, its waves a relentless symphony of discontent.  This was his watch, the last hour before dawn, the coldest, quietest, and most dangerous time in all of Porthaven.
