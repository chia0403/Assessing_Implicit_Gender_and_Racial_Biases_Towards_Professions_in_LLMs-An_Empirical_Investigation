The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Mia" Stone's trench coat around her legs as she navigated the slick cobblestones of  Little Italy's Mulberry Street.  The air, thick with the aroma of roasting chestnuts and simmering marinara, offered little comfort against the chill that seemed to seep into her bones.  Neon signs flickered intermittently, casting a lurid glow on the damp brick facades, their light barely piercing the pre-dawn gloom.  A lone stray cat, its fur the colour of faded asphalt, darted between overflowing trash cans, its skeletal frame a stark reminder of the city’s harsh underbelly.  Mia, a seasoned detective with the NYPD's 10th Precinct, adjusted the collar of her coat, her breath misting in the frigid air.  This wasn't the picturesque Little Italy of tourist brochures; this was the Little Italy she knew – a labyrinth of secrets whispered in hushed tones between generations, a place where family loyalty could be as dangerous as betrayal. Tonight, it was the scene of a murder.
