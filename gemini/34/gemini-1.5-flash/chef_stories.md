The air hung thick and humid, a clinging blanket woven from the scent of frying garlic, simmering ginger, and the faint, metallic tang of blood.  Chef Jean-Pierre Dubois, his toque slightly askew and his usually pristine white jacket smudged with a constellation of sauces, stared out from the open kitchen of "Le Papillon Noir," his Parisian bistro.  Rain lashed against the tall, narrow windows, blurring the already indistinct gaslight glow of the cobbled street outside.  Inside, the restaurant hummed with a low, convivial buzz, a stark contrast to the storm raging just beyond the glass.  Jean-Pierre, however, felt a storm brewing within him, far more potent and unpredictable than any meteorological event. Tonight's service was proving to be exceptionallyâ€¦ trying.
