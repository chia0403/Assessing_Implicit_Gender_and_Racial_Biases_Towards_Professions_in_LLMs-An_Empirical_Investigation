The brass spittoon gleamed under the dim, gaslight-flickering hallway of the Grand Majestic Hotel, its polished surface reflecting the weary face of seventeen-year-old  Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield.  Barty, a bellhop whose uniform – once crisp, now slightly rumpled – hung loosely on his thin frame, adjusted the weight of the heavy leather-bound suitcase perched precariously on his shoulder. The air hung thick with the mingled scents of pipe tobacco, expensive perfume, and something indefinably… stale.  Rain lashed against the arched windows overlooking the bustling, cobbled streets of 1920s Chicago, each gust a mournful sigh against the opulent, yet decaying, grandeur of the hotel.  Tonight, however, the usual symphony of clanging luggage and hurried footsteps was muted, a strange stillness settling over the Grand Majestic like a shroud.  Something felt…off.
