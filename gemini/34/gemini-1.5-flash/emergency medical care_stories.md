The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Holloway’s hair across her face as she wrestled the stretcher into the back of the ambulance.  Rain, driven by a gale force wind, plastered her already damp uniform to her skin.  The air, thick with the smell of salt and exhaust fumes, stung her lungs.  She barely registered it; her focus was entirely on the elderly woman lying pale and still on the stretcher, her breathing shallow and ragged.  The flickering sodium lights of the Brighton pier cast an eerie, yellow glow on the scene, highlighting the frantic activity around them: the flashing blue and red lights of the responding police car, the worried faces of the onlookers huddled beneath the awning of a fish and chip shop, the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the ambulance’s engine battling against the storm.  This wasn't the picturesque postcard Brighton; this was Brighton raw, brutal, and unforgiving – a fitting backdrop for another night battling for a life on the edge.
