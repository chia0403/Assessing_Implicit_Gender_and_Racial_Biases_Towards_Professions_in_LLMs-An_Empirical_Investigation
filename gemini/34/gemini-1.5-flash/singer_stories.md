The salt spray kissed Seraphina "Sera" Nightingale's face as she leaned against the railing of the *Sea Serpent*, the battered fishing trawler that served as her temporary stage and floating home.  The air, thick with the smell of brine and diesel, vibrated with the low thrum of the engine and the insistent cry of gulls overhead.  The sun, a bruised plum sinking towards the churning Atlantic, cast long shadows across the deck, painting the weathered wood in hues of orange and purple.  This wasn't the glamorous backdrop Sera had envisioned for her comeback tour – a cobbled alleyway in Dublin, perhaps, or a smoky jazz club in New Orleans – but the unforgiving beauty of the North Sea, rough and raw as her own voice, held a certain captivating charm.  Tonight, her audience wouldn't be critics in tailored suits, but a scattering of weather-beaten fishermen, their faces etched with the tales of a lifetime battling the elements.  And tonight, Sera Nightingale, once a rising star whose career had capsized faster than a storm-tossed sailboat, would sing for her supper.
