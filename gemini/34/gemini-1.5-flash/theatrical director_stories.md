The biting November wind whipped Amelia Katherine Blackwoodâ€™s auburn hair across her face as she wrestled with a recalcitrant stage door.  Rust groaned in protest with every heave, a soundtrack to the swirling chaos of discarded costumes, half-eaten sandwiches, and the lingering scent of stale beer that permeated the backstage area of the dilapidated Grand Majestic Theatre.  Rain, a relentless percussionist, hammered against the corrugated iron roof above, mimicking the frantic rhythm of her own heartbeat.  Inside, the cavernous space was a tomb of velvet curtains and dusty grandeur, a ghostly testament to a bygone era of glittering premieres and celebrated actors. Amelia, however, saw not ghosts, but potential.  Potential for a revival so stunning, so breathtaking, that it would resurrect not just the play, but the entire crumbling theatre itself.  Tonight, she was staging a dress rehearsal for "The Serpent's Kiss," a forgotten melodrama ripe for rediscovery, and the air crackled with a tension far more potent than any stage lightning.
