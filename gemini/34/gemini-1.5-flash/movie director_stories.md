The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Mia" Davenport's hair across her face as she surveyed the desolate, windswept landscape.  Grey, churning clouds hung low over the skeletal remains of a long-abandoned whaling station on the remote island of Grimsey, Iceland.  The air smelled of brine and something ancient, something faintly metallic that clung to the back of her throat.  This wasn't exactly the picturesque Tuscan villa she'd envisioned for her new film, "The Leviathan's Lament," a gothic horror steeped in maritime folklore.  But then again, Mia Davenport rarely did things the easy way.  The decaying wooden structures, their timbers gnawed by time and sea spray, offered a stark, brutal beauty that perfectly captured the film's unsettling mood.  She adjusted the thick wool scarf around her neck, a shiver running down her spine that had nothing to do with the cold.  This island, this location, feltâ€¦alive.  And not in a good way.
