The salt spray stung Amelia "Mia" Holloway's face, a familiar kiss from the unforgiving Atlantic.  She stood perched on the jagged rocks of Penzance Head, the wind whipping her auburn hair across her oilslicked canvas. Below, the churning grey sea swallowed the setting sun, leaving behind a bruised, violet sky that bled into the bruised, violet hues already laid down on her palette.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and seaweed, carried the distant mournful cry of gulls, a counterpoint to the rhythmic crash of waves against the granite cliffs.  Mia, her fingers stiff with cold, squeezed more titanium white onto her brush, the act a small rebellion against the overwhelming power of the storm brewing both within and without.  Her easel, stubbornly planted in a crevice between two rocks, threatened to be toppled by the rising wind, a fitting metaphor for the turmoil gripping her heart.  This painting, "Storm's Embrace," was proving to be as tempestuous as the subject itself.
