The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Amy” Hernandez’s hair across her face as she hurried down the cobblestone street, the scent of woodsmoke and roasting chestnuts doing little to warm her chilled bones.  Rain, a relentless drizzle that had been falling since dawn, plastered her dark coat to her back.  Across the street, the gas lamps of Oakhaven’s Old Town flickered against the gloom, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to writhe and twist in the perpetual twilight.  Amy, a registered nurse at St. Jude's Hospital, pulled her scarf tighter, the worn wool offering scant comfort against the penetrating damp.  Tonight, however, the weather was the least of her worries.  A frantic phone call, choked with fear and barely audible over the static, had summoned her to a shadowed alleyway, a place whispered about in hushed tones even amongst the seasoned emergency responders of Oakhaven.  A place where hope, Amy suspected, rarely visited.
