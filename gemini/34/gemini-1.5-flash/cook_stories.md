The air hung thick and sweet, a cloying blend of roasting spices and simmering tamarind.  A lone gecko, fat and iridescent, clung to the terracotta wall of the kitchen, its tiny eyes blinking in the flickering lamplight.  Outside, the night in Goa throbbed with the insistent rhythm of tabla drums and the distant, mournful cry of a fishing boat’s horn.  Inside, amidst the chaotic beauty of pots bubbling over charcoal braziers and cleavers glinting under the low ceiling,  Chef Anya Sharma, her brow slick with sweat, meticulously arranged a vibrant platter of Goan fish curry, its scarlet sauce gleaming like molten rubies.  The scent, a heady mix of coconut milk, mustard seeds, and fiery chilies, promised a feast fit for a maharaja, a feast that, tonight, would decide Anya’s fate.
