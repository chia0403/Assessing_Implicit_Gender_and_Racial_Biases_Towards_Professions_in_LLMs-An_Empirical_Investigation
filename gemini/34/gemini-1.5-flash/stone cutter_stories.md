The wind, a rasping chisel against the granite cliffs, whipped Elias Thorne's grey hair across his weathered face.  He stood perched precariously on a ledge overlooking the churning, grey-green waters of the North Sea, the spray misting his thick wool coat. Below, the fishing village of Port Blossom huddled like a cluster of barnacles clinging to the rock face, its tiny houses dwarfed by the imposing cliffs that cradled it. Elias, a stone cutter by trade and a solitary man by nature, felt more at home amidst the raw power of the ocean and the unyielding strength of the granite than he ever did amidst the gossiping chatter of the village.  The air, thick with the scent of salt and the sharp tang of seaweed, was a familiar comfort, a constant companion in his lonely, but fiercely independent life.  His calloused hands, gnarled and strong as the stone he shaped, rested on the handle of his trusty hammer, its head worn smooth from years of tireless work.  Today, however, his hammer remained idle, his gaze fixed on a particular section of cliff face, a challenge carved by centuries of wind and tide, awaiting his skilled touch.
