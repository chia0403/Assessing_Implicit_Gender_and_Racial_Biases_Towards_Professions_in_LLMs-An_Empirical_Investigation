The greasy scent of motor oil clung to Elias Thorne like a second skin, a familiar perfume that spoke of long hours spent wrestling with recalcitrant engines and the stubborn defiance of metal.  Elias, a man whose calloused hands betrayed a life lived amongst wrenches and spark plugs, squinted at the sunset bleeding across the corrugated iron roof of Thorne's Auto Repair.  The setting sun cast long shadows across the cluttered yard, painting the rusting hulks of abandoned cars in hues of orange and purple. Dust motes danced in the fading light, illuminated by the single bare bulb hanging precariously over his workbench, a testament to the shop’s age and Elias’s somewhat haphazard approach to maintenance, both personal and professional.  Thorne's, nestled on the outskirts of the forgotten town of Havenwood, wasn't exactly thriving, but it was home.  And tonight, home smelled strongly of burnt coffee and the faint, metallic tang of impending trouble.
