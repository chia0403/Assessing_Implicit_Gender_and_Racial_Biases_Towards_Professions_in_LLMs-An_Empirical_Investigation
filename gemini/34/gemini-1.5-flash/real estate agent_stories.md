The salt spray kissed Amelia Hernandez’s face as she wrestled the stubborn lock on the weathered gate.  October wind howled a mournful tune through the cypress trees lining the driveway, their skeletal branches clawing at the bruised, twilight sky.  Amelia, a real estate agent whose portfolio boasted more oceanfront mansions than modest bungalows, found herself strangely unsettled by the isolation of this property.  Hidden away on a windswept peninsula jutting out into the churning Atlantic, the house itself – a sprawling Victorian behemoth, painted a sickly shade of grey – seemed to slump under the weight of its own decaying grandeur, a forgotten queen brooding over her crumbling kingdom.  The listing called it “charmingly rustic,” but Amelia suspected “haunted and possibly condemned” was a more accurate description.  This was not the kind of property that usually landed on her desk; this was… different.
