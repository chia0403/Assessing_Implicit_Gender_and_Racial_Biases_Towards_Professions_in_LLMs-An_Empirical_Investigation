The fluorescent lights of Sterling & Croft hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the frantic tap-tap-tapping of Penelope Anne Featherstonehaugh's perfectly manicured fingernails against the polished mahogany of her desk.  Penelope, or Penny as she reluctantly allowed a select few to call her, surveyed her kingdom: a pristine reception area smelling faintly of lemon polish and simmering resentment.  Outside, the relentless London drizzle mirrored the grey mood settling over the city, and the only sounds louder than the hum of the lights were the occasional disgruntled cough from a waiting client and the rhythmic whir of the ancient water cooler â€“ a machine that sounded suspiciously like a dying whale.  The opulent, yet somehow sterile, Sterling & Croft law firm felt less like a sanctuary of justice and more like a gilded cage, especially on a Tuesday.
