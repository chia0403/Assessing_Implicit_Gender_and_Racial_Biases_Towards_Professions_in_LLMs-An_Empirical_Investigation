The scent of Bay Rum and sawdust hung thick and sweet in the air, a familiar perfume to Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, proprietor of Butterfield's Barbershop.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single, dusty window overlooking Elm Street, danced in the afternoon sunbeams that slanted through the grime.  Barty, his hands stained a permanent auburn from years of wielding clippers and shears, hummed a forgotten blues tune as he meticulously swept the faded, checkered floor. Outside, the relentless summer heat of Charleston, South Carolina, shimmered off the cobblestones, baking the already humid air.  The rhythmic *thwack-thwack* of his broom was the only sound besides the distant, lazy drone of cicadas, a sound as much a part of the Charleston rhythm as the slow sway of the palmetto trees.  This was his sanctuary, this tiny barbershop, a place where secrets were whispered and lives were quietly shaped, one careful snip at a time.
