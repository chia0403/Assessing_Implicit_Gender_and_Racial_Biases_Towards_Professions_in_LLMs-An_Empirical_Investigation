The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume only Amelia Hernandez truly understood.  It was the aroma of a long day at "Shear Perfection," her tiny, sun-drenched salon nestled on the cobbled side street of Calle de los Susurros – Whisper Street – in Seville, Spain.  The street, usually bustling with the midday chatter of vendors and hurried footsteps, was hushed now, the late afternoon sun casting long shadows that stretched across the terracotta tiles. Amelia, her fingers stained a faint orange from the henna she’d used earlier, leaned back in her worn leather barber's chair, the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of her shears replaced by the gentle clinking of a tiny, almost forgotten music box on the counter.  A single stray curl of raven hair, escaping the elegant chignon of her own meticulously styled updo, tumbled onto her cheek.  The silence, however, was deceptive.  The whispers of Seville, usually carried on the breeze, seemed to echo within the walls of her salon, promising a story yet to unfold.
