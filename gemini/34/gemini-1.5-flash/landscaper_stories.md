The dawn bled rose and apricot across the dew-kissed lawns of Willow Creek Estates, painting the manicured hedges in hues of soft fire.  A lone figure, silhouetted against the brightening sky, pushed a wheezing lawnmower across a stretch of emerald-green perfection.  This was Elias Thorne's domain, his canvas, his daily meditation.  Elias, a man whose hands were as rough as bark and as delicate as a budding flower, depending on the task, surveyed his kingdom with a critical eye.  The air, still cool with the lingering night, carried the scent of freshly cut grass and the promise of another long, sun-drenched day transforming the carefully sculpted landscapes of Willow Creek.  His worn leather work boots crunched softly on the gravel path, a counterpoint to the rhythmic drone of the mower, a sound as familiar to him as his own heartbeat.
