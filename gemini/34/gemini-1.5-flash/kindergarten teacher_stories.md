The chipped paint of Ms. Eleanor Vance’s classroom smelled faintly of glitter, glue, and impending naptime.

Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the ancient window frames and promising a blustery afternoon.  Inside, however, a different kind of storm was brewing – a pre-naptime meltdown, specifically, courtesy of little Timmy Fitzwilliam and his inexplicable aversion to sharing his prized purple dinosaur.
