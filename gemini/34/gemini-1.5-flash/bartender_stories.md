The chipped Formica countertop felt cold beneath Elias Thorne's calloused fingertips as he polished a glass, the rhythmic swirl mirroring the chaotic calm of a Friday night at The Rusty Mug.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the neon glow of the liquor store across the street into a hazy, orange smear.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of stale beer, cheap whiskey, and the faint, almost imperceptible perfume of desperation – a familiar aroma to Elias, a seasoned veteran of late nights and broken hearts.  The Rusty Mug, tucked away on a forgotten corner of Bleecker Street, was less a bar and more a confessional, a haven for the city's lost souls seeking solace in the bottom of a glass.  Tonight, the usual clientele was augmented by a fresh batch of damp and dishevelled newcomers, their faces etched with the city’s relentless chill.
