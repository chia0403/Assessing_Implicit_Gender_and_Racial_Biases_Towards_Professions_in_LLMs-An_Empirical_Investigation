The scent of rosemary and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Aurelia “Relly” Davenport.  Relly, owner and sole stylist of "Shear Perfection," adjusted the vintage emerald brooch pinned to her crisp white smock, its cool surface a counterpoint to the simmering chaos of her tiny, sun-drenched salon nestled on the cobbled side street of St. Ives, Cornwall. Rain lashed against the mismatched windowpanes, a relentless drumming that echoed the frantic rhythm of her own heartbeat.  Outside, the Atlantic roared its displeasure, a fitting soundtrack to the brewing storm – both meteorological and personal – that threatened to engulf her.  The old, creaking floorboards groaned underfoot as she moved, each squeak a testament to the years of laughter, tears, and countless transformations that had taken place within these four walls.  Tonight, however, felt different.  Heavier.  A secret, thick and suffocating, hung in the air alongside the rosemary and sugar, promising trouble as surely as the approaching squall promised a deluge.
