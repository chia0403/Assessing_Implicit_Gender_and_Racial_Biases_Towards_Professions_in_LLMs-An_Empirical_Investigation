The wind, a rasping, gravelly voice, whispered secrets across the parched earth of the Broken Tooth Ranch.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of ochre and brown, danced a frantic jig across the cracked soil, mirroring the turmoil in Elias Thorne’s gut.

This wasn't just a dry spell; this was a drought, a bone-dry, soul-crushing drought that threatened to swallow the ranch whole, leaving behind only the ghosts of cattle and the bitter taste of failure. The air hung heavy with the scent of dust and despair, broken only by the occasional, mournful caw of a lone crow circling overhead.  The Broken Tooth, once a testament to his family’s legacy, felt more like a tomb each passing day.
