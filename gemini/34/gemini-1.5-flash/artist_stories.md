The salt spray kissed Elias Thorne's face, carrying the sharp tang of brine and the faint, sweeter scent of kelp drying on the rocks below.  He stood perched precariously on the wind-whipped cliffs overlooking the churning grey expanse of the Atlantic, his easel braced against the unforgiving wind with a groan of protesting wood.  The canvas, a pristine expanse of white, mocked his creative paralysis.  The dramatic, tempestuous beauty of the scene before him – the jagged teeth of the cliffs, the frothing waves that crashed against the shore with a roar that echoed in his bones – was overwhelming, a chaotic symphony he felt incapable of translating onto the flat, unforgiving surface of his oils.  Elias, a landscape artist known for his breathtakingly precise depictions of tranquil countryside scenes, felt utterly, hopelessly lost in the wild, untamed heart of the Cornish coast.
