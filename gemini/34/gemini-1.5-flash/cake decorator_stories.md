The scent of vanilla bean and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a comforting perfume that clung to Amelia Grace Hawthorne like a second skin.  Amelia, or "Amy" to her closest friends (a dwindling number these days, thanks to the relentless demands of her burgeoning cake empire), surveyed her kingdom:  "Sweet Surrender," a quaint, almost ridiculously charming bakery nestled on a cobbled side street in the historic district of Charleston, South Carolina.  Sunlight streamed through the tall, arched windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air above rows of perfectly frosted cupcakes and towering tiered cakes, each a miniature architectural marvel of buttercream and fondant.  Outside, Spanish moss draped languidly from ancient oak trees, a gentle sea breeze whispering secrets through the palmetto fronds.  But inside, Amy felt anything but serene.  The deadline for the Drayton family's wedding cake loomed – a monstrosity of ivory lace and edible orchids – and the pressure was starting to crack her usually unflappable composure, like a poorly constructed gingerbread house collapsing under the weight of its own sugary ambition.
