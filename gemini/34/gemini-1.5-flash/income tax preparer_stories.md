The fluorescent lights of Amelia Hernandezâ€™s tiny tax preparation office hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the frantic tapping of her fingers on the keyboard.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grimy window, illuminating the chaotic landscape of her desk: stacks of 1040 forms teetering precariously, a half-eaten bag of stale tortilla chips, a chipped mug depicting a cartoonishly cheerful leprechaun, and a single, wilting peace lily struggling for survival in a cracked terracotta pot.  Outside, the relentless rhythm of rush hour traffic throbbed against the walls of her cramped storefront in the less-than-glamorous part of Bakersfield, California.  The air hung heavy with the scent of cheap coffee and the lingering aroma of last week's client's questionable tuna sandwich.  This was Amelia's kingdom, her annual battleground against the IRS, and this year, the stakes felt higher than ever.
