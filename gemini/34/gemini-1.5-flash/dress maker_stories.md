The scent of lavender and aged linen hung heavy in the air, a comforting perfume that clung to the velvet curtains and the worn wooden floors of  "Stitches in Time,"  a dressmaking atelier tucked away on a cobbled side street in Prague.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sunbeams that slanted through the tall, arched windows, illuminating the intricate embroidery on a half-finished gown draped over a tailor's dummy.  This was the domain of  Seraphina  "Sera"  Kovářová, a woman whose nimble fingers could coax silk into whispering curves and whose creative spirit wove magic into every stitch.  The air thrummed with the quiet hum of her sewing machine, a rhythmic counterpoint to the cacophony of the city just beyond her window.  Today, however, the usual peaceful rhythm was disrupted.  A frantic knock echoed through the shop, shattering the serene atmosphere and promising a disruption as dramatic as the ruby-red silk spilling from a half-opened box on her worktable.
