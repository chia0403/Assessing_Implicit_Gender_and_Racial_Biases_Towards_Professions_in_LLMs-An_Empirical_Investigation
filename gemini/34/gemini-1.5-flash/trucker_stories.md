The diesel engine coughed, a low, guttural rumble that vibrated through Jedediah “Jed” Stone’s worn leather boots.  He gripped the steering wheel of his eighteen-wheeler, “Betsy,” a chrome-plated behemoth that had seen more miles than most people had seen sunsets.  The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of pine and damp earth, the kind of smell that clung to the mountain roads winding through the Cascade Range. Rain, a persistent drizzle that blurred the already fading light, plastered the windshield, obscuring the already treacherous curves ahead. Jed squinted, the wipers battling a losing war against the downpour.  He was halfway up the treacherous Devil’s Pass, a notorious stretch of highway notorious for its hairpin turns and unpredictable weather, and already feeling the familiar gnawing anxiety that always accompanied this leg of his route. Tonight, however, the usual trepidation was amplified by a strange, unsettling feeling, a premonition as cold and sharp as the mountain wind whipping around Betsy’s cab.
