The brass nameplate on the mahogany desk gleamed under the soft glow of the lobby's crystal chandelier:  *Aurelia "Rel" Marigold, Concierge*.  Rel adjusted the crisp, ivory silk scarf at her throat, the weight of it a comforting counterpoint to the nervous flutter in her stomach. Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of the opulent Bellagio Tower, blurring the already hazy neon glow of the Las Vegas Strip into a shimmering, almost ethereal canvas.  Inside, the air hummed with a low thrum of controlled chaos – the hushed whispers of high-rollers, the click-clack of perfectly polished shoes on marble floors, and the almost imperceptible scent of expensive perfume mingling with the faint, metallic tang of ozone from the storm.  Tonight, however, felt different.  Even the usually placid hum of the Bellagio fountain, visible through the rain-streaked glass, seemed to pulse with an unspoken urgency.  Rel’s carefully constructed composure threatened to unravel as she glanced at the encrypted message flickering on her secure terminal:  *Request:  Midnight.  Rooftop.  Codeword: Nightingale.*
