The biting wind whipped Dr. Evelyn Reed’s auburn hair across her face as she wrestled the heavy oak door of the Alder Creek Animal Clinic open.  The air, thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, carried a hint of something else – something acrid and unsettling, like burnt fur.  Alder Creek, a remote village nestled deep within the Oregon Cascades, was beautiful, a postcard-perfect scene of snow-dusted pines and a rushing river carving its way through a valley blanketed in winter’s stillness.  But tonight, the stillness felt oppressive, a stark contrast to the frantic thumping of her own heart.  The single, flickering lamp outside cast long, dancing shadows, making the already isolated clinic seem even more vulnerable.  Inside, the only sound was the rhythmic ticking of the grandfather clock in the reception area, each tick a measured beat against the rising unease in Evelyn’s stomach.  This wasn't a typical Tuesday night in Alder Creek.
