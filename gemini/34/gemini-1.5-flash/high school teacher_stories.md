The chipped paint of the "Welcome to Northwood High" sign flaked onto the already littered asphalt like a premature snowfall.  October’s wind, a bitter bite even at midday, whipped Amelia Katherine Hayes’s auburn hair across her face.  Amelia, or Miss Hayes as her students knew her, shivered, pulling her worn tweed jacket tighter.  The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the sprawling, somewhat neglected campus, highlighting the rusting swing sets and the graffiti-scarred brick walls of the gymnasium.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp leaves and the faint, lingering aroma of stale gym socks, a familiar fragrance to anyone who'd spent even a single day at Northwood High.  Inside, the fluorescent lights of the English department hummed a monotonous tune, a stark contrast to the riotous energy that usually filled the halls – energy that was now mostly dissipated, leaving behind only a quiet, expectant hum.  This was the calm before the storm; parent-teacher night.
