The fluorescent hum of the overhead lights throbbed in time with the dull ache in Elias Thorne's lower back.  Elias, a man whose life was measured not in years but in the meticulously polished gleam of linoleum floors and the faint, lingering scent of lemon-scented cleaner, sighed.  It was 2:17 AM, the graveyard shift at the sprawling, gothic monstrosity that was Blackwood Manor – a place whispered to be haunted, a claim Elias had always dismissed with a weary shrug and a swipe of his mop.  Tonight, however, the usual chill of the old building felt…different.  A deeper, more unsettling cold seemed to seep from the very stones, clinging to him like the dampness clinging to the ancient tapestries hanging in the deserted East Wing. The only sound, besides the rhythmic squeak of his mop bucket on the marble, was the mournful creak of the manor itself, settling into its centuries-old slumber – or perhaps, something else entirely.
