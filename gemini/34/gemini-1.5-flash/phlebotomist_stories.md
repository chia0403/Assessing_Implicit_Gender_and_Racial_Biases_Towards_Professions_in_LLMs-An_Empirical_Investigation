The fluorescent lights of the Meadowbrook Medical Clinic hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* of Amelia Grace Hawthorneâ€™s own pulse.  Amelia, a phlebotomist with hands as steady as a seasoned surgeon's and eyes that could spot a hidden vein at fifty paces,  felt the familiar knot of pre-appointment anxiety tighten in her stomach.  It wasn't the needles, not really.  Amelia had drawn blood from toddlers throwing tantrums, elderly patients trembling with fear, and even a rather aggressive chihuahua (the chihuahua, surprisingly, had been the easiest).  No, it was the silent weight of expectation that hung in the air of the sterile waiting room, the unspoken plea in every patient's gaze:  *Don't hurt me.*  Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the manicured lawns of the clinic's grounds, a stark contrast to the antiseptic chill that permeated the air within.  Today, however, the usual calm was shattered by the frantic arrival of a man, his face pale and etched with a terror that even Amelia's years of experience couldn't quite decipher.
