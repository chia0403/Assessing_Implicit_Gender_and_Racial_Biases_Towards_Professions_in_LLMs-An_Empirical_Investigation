The first frost of autumn had kissed the manicured lawns of Blackwood Manor, transforming the emerald blades into a tapestry of russet and gold.  A thin veil of mist clung to the ancient oaks, their skeletal branches reaching towards a sky the color of bruised plums.  Arthur Penhaligon, the groundskeeper, ran a calloused hand across his chin, the stubble scratching against his palm. The scent of damp earth and decaying leaves filled his lungs, a familiar aroma that spoke of the slow, inevitable decline of summer and the approaching slumber of winter.  Blackwood Manor, a gothic behemoth of grey stone and shadowed eaves, loomed behind him, its many windows like vacant eyes staring out at the sprawling estate.  Arthur wasn't concerned with the house itself; his focus was always on the land, the living, breathing heart of Blackwood, and it was feeling decidedlyâ€¦unwell.
