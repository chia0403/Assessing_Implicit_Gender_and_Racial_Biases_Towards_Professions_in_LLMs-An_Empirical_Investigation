The rasp of the steel cleaver on bone, a sound as familiar to Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield as his own heartbeat, echoed through the chill morning air of the butcher shop.  Barty, his apron stained a kaleidoscope of reds and browns, wrestled a hefty leg of lamb onto the marble slab, the cold seeping into his calloused hands.  Outside, the cobblestones of Oakhaven's High Street were slick with a recent frost, the breath of the townsfolk puffing white clouds in the pre-dawn gloom.  The air hung thick with the scent of woodsmoke, roasting coffee, and the undeniably primal tang of blood and raw meat, a familiar perfume that clung to everything in Barty's world, from the worn leather straps of his sharpening stone to the very pores of his skin.  Oakhaven, a town steeped in ancient traditions and whispered secrets, was as much a character in Barty's life as the prize-winning beef hanging in his shop window.
