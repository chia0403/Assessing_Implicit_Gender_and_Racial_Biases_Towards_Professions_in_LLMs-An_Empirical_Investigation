The wind howled a mournful tune around Elias Thorne, whipping his already-tangled brown hair across his face as he clung to the guttering of the old Victorian.  Below, the cobbled streets of Ashworth, a town clinging precariously to the cliff edge, were lashed by a relentless rain that turned the already-gloomy November day into a watercolour painting of greys and bruised purples.  Each gust threatened to tear him from his precarious perch, but Elias, a seasoned roofer with hands as rough as bark and eyes the colour of a stormy sea, held firm.  The scent of damp slate and decaying wood filled his nostrils, mingling with the sharp tang of the salt spray that drifted in from the churning North Sea. This wasn't just another job; this was a fight against the elements, a dance with death on a slate-grey stage, a hundred feet above the unforgiving rocks below.
