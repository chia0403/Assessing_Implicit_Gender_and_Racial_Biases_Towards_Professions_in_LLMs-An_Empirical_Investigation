The biting Antarctic wind howled a mournful song around Dr. Evelyn Reedâ€™s research station, a lonely outpost clinging precariously to the edge of the ice shelf.  It was a sound Evelyn had grown accustomed to over the past three years, a constant, icy counterpoint to the rhythmic hum of the generators that kept her laboratory alive.  The year was 2077, and the air, even inside the heated confines of the station, held a persistent chill that seeped into the bones and settled in the soul.  Outside, the unending white expanse stretched to the horizon, broken only by the jagged, unforgiving peaks of the Transantarctic Mountains, their snow-covered slopes shimmering faintly under the perpetual twilight of the austral winter.  Evelyn, bundled in layers of thermal gear, stared out at the desolate landscape, a single, unwavering beam of her headlamp cutting through the swirling snow. Tonight, she was expecting something extraordinary.  Something that could rewrite the textbooks. Something that might just save the world.
