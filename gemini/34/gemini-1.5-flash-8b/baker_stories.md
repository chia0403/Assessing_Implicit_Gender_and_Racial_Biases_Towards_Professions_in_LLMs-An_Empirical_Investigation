The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the cobblestones of Rue de la Fleur, painting the narrow street in a warm, yet ominous glow.  Rain, thick and relentless, hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the bakery, “Le Pain de L’Aube” – The Bread of Dawn – creating a constant, rhythmic percussion.  Inside, bathed in the comforting yellow light of the oven,  Elodie Dubois, the baker, meticulously kneaded a mound of dough, her movements precise and rhythmic.  Flour dusted her apron and the air, thick with the fragrant aroma of yeast and freshly ground rye.  The smell, usually a welcome balm, today held a particular poignancy.  It was the eve of the annual Harvest Festival, and a palpable tension hung in the air, thick as the fog that clung to the Seine.
