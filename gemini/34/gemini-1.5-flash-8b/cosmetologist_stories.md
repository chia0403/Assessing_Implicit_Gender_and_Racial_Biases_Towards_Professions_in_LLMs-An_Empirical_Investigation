The humid air hung heavy in the salon, thick with the scent of jasmine and something faintly metallic, probably the blood-orange dye Emilia, the salon's resident colorist, had just finished applying.  The rhythmic hum of the hair dryers and the low thrum of the conversation across the room created a soothing, if slightly suffocating, soundtrack to Emilia "Ember"  Catalina's day.  She was hunched over the back of a client's chair, her fingers expertly maneuvering a tiny, almost invisible brush, shaping the sculpted layers of a crimson-red bob.  Outside, the bustling city of New Corinth echoed with the relentless roar of traffic, a stark contrast to the tranquil oasis of scent and sculpted hair within the salon walls.

Emilia, a woman of striking olive skin and vibrant, midnight-black hair, draped across her shoulders in a long braid, focused intently on her work.  Her brow was furrowed, a testament to the intricacy of the cut, and her brow was often framed by a pair of thick-rimmed glasses perched on her nose.  The salon, "Threads of Time," a small, family-owned establishment nestled in the heart of a historic district, boasted a bohemian-chic aesthetic.  Copper-toned walls, adorned with vibrant tapestries and antique mirrors, reflected the warm light filtering through the large windows.  The air was perpetually charged with the energy of creativity, a symphony of whispered secrets and the cheerful chatter of happy clients. This particular afternoon, though, the focus was sharply on Emilia, whose precision was renowned throughout the city.
