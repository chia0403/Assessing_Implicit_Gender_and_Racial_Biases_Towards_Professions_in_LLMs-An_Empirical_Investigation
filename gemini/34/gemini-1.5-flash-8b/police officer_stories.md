The biting wind whipped rain-slicked strands of Amelia "Amy"  Harding's dark hair across her face, stinging her cheeks.  The flickering neon sign of the "Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow on the already dismal alleyway.  She squinted, the metallic tang of exhaust and something vaguely chemical clinging to the air.  This was the heart of the Southside's underbelly, a labyrinth of forgotten streets and whispered secrets.  A concrete jungle where shadows stretched long and distorted, claiming every inch of darkness.  Amy, Detective Harding of the Chicago Police Department, wasn't exactly thrilled to be here.  Her trench coat, usually a symbol of professional composure, felt damp and heavy against her. The city, normally a sprawling tapestry of lights and activity, felt suffocating in this isolated pocket of misery.  The rhythmic clang of a distant firetruck, a stark contrast to the oppressive silence of the alley, seemed to mock her patience.
