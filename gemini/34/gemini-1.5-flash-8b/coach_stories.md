The biting wind whipped Amelia "Sparrow" Finch's auburn hair across her face, stinging her cheeks with icy needles.  She hunched deeper into her worn leather jacket, clutching the worn leather-bound notebook containing the meticulous training schedule for the Crimson Cliffs Falcons.  The bleachers, usually echoing with the roar of the crowd, were eerily silent beneath the skeletal branches of the ancient oak trees that lined the stadium perimeter.  A thin layer of frost clung to the cracked asphalt, mirroring the brittle frost forming on the edges of Sparrow's determination.  It was the first practice of the season, the pre-season trials, and the pressure, like a tightly wound spring, thrummed beneath her resolve.  

Crimson Cliffs, nestled in the jagged peaks of the Frostfall Mountains, was a town as unforgiving as its terrain.  Winter clung to the valley floor like a suffocating shroud, and the icy winds seemed to carry the whispers of past failures, the echoes of lost seasons.  The small, isolated community, a patchwork of weathered houses clinging to the valley slopes, harbored a deep-seated reverence for the sport of glacial hockey, a game born from the harsh winters and relentless mountains. Each season, the Falcons' fate rested on the shoulders of a new generation of players, on their ability to conquer the formidable icy expanse that served as their playing field.  Sparrow, in her sixth season as coach, knew the weight of that expectation better than any other.
