The chipped porcelain sink, stained a murky beige from decades of lukewarm water and forgotten shaving creams, reflected the flickering gaslight above Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's head.  Dust motes danced in the single beam of light, illuminating a tangle of unruly curls clinging to the back of a chair.  Barty, a man whose own hair, despite his profession, had long since succumbed to a quiet, receding battle with the temples, hunched over his shears, the rhythmic snip-snip a counterpoint to the almost imperceptible crackle of the gas.  He was a barber in the heart of Old Willow Creek, a town steeped in the quiet murmur of the surrounding forest and the ghosts of forgotten industries.  The air hung thick with the smell of woodsmoke, brewing coffee, and something vaguely metallic, a scent that only Old Willow Creek seemed to understand.

The year was 1887.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Barty's shop, a relentless percussion that echoed the steady beat of his own weary heart.  The aroma of rain-soaked earth and pine needles filled the tiny space, mingling with the lingering scent of pipe tobacco and the faint sweetness of the local confectioner's shop across the street.  Barty's small shop, tucked between a blacksmith's forge and a general store, was more a haven than a business.  A quiet haven, filled with the hushed conversations of clients, the scrape of leather shoes on wooden floors, and the comforting, predictable rhythm of life. The shop's wooden walls held the secrets of countless tales, whispered into the ears of those who sought refuge and quiet counsel.
