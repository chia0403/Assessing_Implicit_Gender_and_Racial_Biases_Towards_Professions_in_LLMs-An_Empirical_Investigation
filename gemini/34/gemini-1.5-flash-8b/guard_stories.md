Sergeant Kael Thorne, weathered and gaunt, stared out at the endless ochre expanse from his post atop the crumbling watchtower.  The rusted iron railing felt cold against his calloused fingers, a stark contrast to the fiery heat that had plagued the region just weeks prior.  His leather jerkin, thick with patches and reinforced with hardened bronze, offered little protection from the frigid blast.  The watchtower, a skeletal relic of a bygone era, stood sentinel over the lonely road, its broken stones whispering tales of forgotten battles and vanished civilizations.  Below, the cracked earth trembled with the rhythmic groan of the wind, a sound that echoed the emptiness in Kael's heart.  He had been stationed here, on the furthest edge of the kingdom, for three years now, a solitary outpost against a tide of encroaching chaos. This was the only place the King would keep him, the only place he would let him be.
