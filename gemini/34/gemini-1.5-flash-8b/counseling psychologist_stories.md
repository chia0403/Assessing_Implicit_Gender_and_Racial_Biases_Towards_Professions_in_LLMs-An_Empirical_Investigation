The flickering fluorescent lights of the waiting room hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the hushed whispers and the rhythmic tapping of fingernails on Formica.  Rain hammered against the grimy windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  Eleanor Vance, a counseling psychologist with ten years of experience navigating the tangled paths of human distress, stared at the meticulously organized stack of patient files.  Each one a life, a story, a constellation of joys and sorrows meticulously cataloged within its pages.  Today, however, the stories felt less like individual constellations and more like a single, overwhelming nebula.  The city outside her window, normally a symphony of honking taxis and hurried footsteps, had been reduced to a muted roar, a backdrop to the impending storm within her own mind.

The waiting room was a study in muted tones.  Off-white walls, worn floral carpet, and sterile plastic chairs formed a sterile landscape.  A single potted fern, wilting under the relentless fluorescent glare, was the only hint of life.  The air, thick with the scent of antiseptic and stale coffee, hung heavy, mirroring the oppressive atmosphere in Eleanor's own soul.  A faint, almost imperceptible aroma of lavender clung to the room, a reminder of the essential oils diffuser she kept on her desk, a futile attempt to temper the volatile energies swirling around her.  The chipped ceramic mug on her desk, filled with lukewarm chamomile tea, sat untouched.  Her mind, like the tea, was cold and stirring without purpose.
