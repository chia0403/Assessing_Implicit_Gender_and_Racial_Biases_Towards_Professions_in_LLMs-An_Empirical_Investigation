The fluorescent hum of the lab, a constant low thrumming, was the only sound Amelia Kensington heard above the rhythmic *thwap, thwap, thwap* of her own heart.  Each drop of blood, meticulously collected, felt like a tiny, silent confession.  Amelia, a phlebotomist at the bustling Metropolitan Medical Center, knew the stories whispered in those crimson streams.  Stories of heartache and triumph, of quiet desperation and fervent hope.  Her sterile gloves, a comforting barrier, offered a strange sense of detachment, a shield against the raw emotions that flooded the small, windowless room.  Today, the stories seemed particularly potent.  The air in the pre-analysis waiting room hung thick with anxiety, the nervous fidgeting of patients amplifying the low hum of the lab machinery.  A stark white room, sterile and clinical,  reflected the sterile routine of the job.  Rows of empty examination tables lined the walls, each one a potential vessel for the next unfolding drama.  Amelia, her hair pulled back in a tight bun, focused on the rhythmic pulse of the vein, her face impassive, her movements precise.  She was a silent witness to the human condition.
