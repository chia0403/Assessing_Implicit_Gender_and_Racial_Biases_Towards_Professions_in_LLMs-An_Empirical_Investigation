Tonight, however, the smiles felt strained, like stretched rubber bands about to snap.  Each murmured complaint, each impatient sigh, chipped away at her already frayed nerves.  Outside, the city roared â€“ a relentless, indifferent beast.  Inside, the Golden Spoon was a microcosm of it all, a symphony of simmering frustrations played out on checkered tablecloths.
