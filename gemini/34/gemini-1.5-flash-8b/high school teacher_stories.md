The flickering fluorescent lights of Ms. Eleanor Vance's history classroom hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *tap-tap-tap* of fingers on textbooks.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grimy window, illuminating the faded posters of historical figures.  Chalk dust, a ghostly white, coated the worn wooden surface of her desk, a testament to countless lectures delivered and countless battles fought over the interpretation of the French Revolution.  Eleanor, a woman with eyes the colour of faded sepia photographs and a perpetually tired smile, adjusted her glasses, tracing the faint outline of the American Revolution timeline with a worn, charcoal pencil.  It was a Tuesday, and the usual Tuesday routine was unfolding, predictable and, frankly, tedious.  But today, something felt different.  Not in the classroom itself, not in the low murmur of teenage anxieties, but in the quiet hum of anticipation that seemed to permeate the very air.
