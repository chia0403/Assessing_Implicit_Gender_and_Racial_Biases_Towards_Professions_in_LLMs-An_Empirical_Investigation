The fluorescent hum of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office buzzed a monotonous symphony, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *tap-tap-tap* of her drill.  Sunlight, fractured and distorted by the warped glass of the office's single window, painted shifting patterns on the sterile white walls.  Dust motes danced in the air, illuminated by the harsh glare of the overhead lights.  Eleanor, her brow furrowed in concentration, adjusted the angle of the drill bit, her sharp gaze fixed on the patient's molars.  The patient, a nervous young woman named Amelia, bit her lip, her breath catching in her throat with each grinding sound.

This was a typical Tuesday morning in the small, suburban dental practice Eleanor had inherited from her grandmother, a woman known more for her exacting precision than her bedside manner.  The practice, tucked away on the corner of Oakhaven Avenue and Willow Creek Lane, had seen countless generations of local families pass through its doors.  The chipped enamel on the antique receptionist desk, the worn vinyl upholstery of the waiting room chairs, and the faded posters of healthy smiles told tales of years gone by, each whisper of the past a subtle tremor in the current moment.
