The biting Chicago wind whipped Amelia “Amy”  Everett’s auburn hair across her face as she wrestled the worn leather briefcase against her chest.  October in the Windy City was a cruel mistress, a constant reminder that even the most meticulously curated autumnal displays couldn’t mask the relentless chill.  Rain, already beginning to fall in sheets, plastered the brick facades of the historic Lincoln Park neighborhood to a glistening, almost sinister, gray.  Amy, a seasoned real estate agent with a decade of experience navigating the often-turbulent waters of Chicago’s competitive housing market,  felt a familiar knot of apprehension tighten in her stomach.  Today was the day she’d show the grand Victorian on Sheridan Road, the house whispered about for months, a house rumored to hold more than just architectural charm.  The rumors had been swirling through the broker network, feeding on each other like a hungry pack of wolves, and Amy was ready to unravel the truth, or at least a more complete story, in the face of whatever mysteries the house held.


Setting:


A historic, meticulously maintained Victorian home, nestled on a quiet, tree-lined street in the prestigious Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago.  The house, with its dark woodwork, high ceilings, and ornate detailing, seemed to hold its breath in the chilly autumn air, whispering tales of past generations.  Amy could practically feel the layers of history pressing down on her.  Around the house, the neighborhood boasted a mix of contemporary and historic residences, reflecting the city's vibrant tapestry of eras and tastes.  The nearby Lincoln Park Zoo echoed a tranquil counterpoint to the bustling city surrounding it.
