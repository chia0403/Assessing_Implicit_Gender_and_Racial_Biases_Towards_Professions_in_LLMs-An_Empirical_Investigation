The flickering neon sign of the "Grand Azure" cast a sickly green glow across the rain-slicked cobblestones of the Vieux Quartier.  Rain hammered against the ornate, iron-grilled windows of the hotel, a relentless percussion that seemed to echo the frantic rhythm of Amelia "Amara" Dubois's heart.  Amara, concierge of the Grand Azure, a grand dame of a hotel steeped in Parisian history, stared out at the deluge.  Tonight, the usual bustle of the city was muted, swallowed by the downpour.  Tonight, the city held its breath.  Tonight, a guest with a very specific request had arrived.  

The Grand Azure, built on the foundations of a medieval abbey, exuded an air of antiquated elegance, even in the relentless Parisian drizzle.  Ornate chandeliers, heavy with crystal pendants, cast shimmering patterns on the polished mahogany floors.  The scent of aged parchment and pipe tobacco mingled with the crisp, clean aroma of freshly brewed coffee, a comforting contrast to the harsh elements outside.  The lobby, despite the quietude, hummed with the faint, almost imperceptible, sounds of whispered conversations and the gentle clinking of silverware.  Upstairs, in rooms overlooking the Seine, secrets, both old and new, were brewing, just as unspoken as the persistent rain.
