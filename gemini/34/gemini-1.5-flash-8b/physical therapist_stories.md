Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, a relentless drumming that mirrored the frantic rhythm in Amelia Carmichael's chest.  The small, brightly painted building, nestled in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, felt claustrophobic, a stark contrast to the vast, open landscapes that spilled out from its windows.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the gloom, illuminating a scattering of medical equipment –  wobbly weights, brightly coloured resistance bands, the worn leather of a battered exercise ball.  Amelia, her name a whisper in the downpour, hunched over a patient chart, the faded ink blurring against the slick paper.  Today, as every day for the past three months, the rain felt heavier, the air thicker with a sense of impending doom that she couldn’t quite place.  Outside, the distant howl of a coyote, usually a comforting sound in this quiet valley, sounded unnervingly sharp, a lonely cry echoing the emptiness she felt inside.
