The biting wind whipped Amelia "Milly" Blackwood's hair across her face, stinging her cheeks like shards of ice.  Below, the jagged peaks of the Cordillera Blanca, dusted with perpetual snow, scraped the bruised violet sky.  She gripped the controls of the battered, but loyal, Cessna 182, the rhythmic thump of the engine a familiar lullaby against the howling blizzard.  Altitude: 14,500 feet.  Visibility: zero.  Milly pressed her lips together, focusing on the faintest whisper of radio static, the only connection to the outside world.  Tonight, the world was a sea of white, and the only path was the one carved into the mountain itself, a path she had flown many times but never in these conditions. This was not just a flight; it was a lifeline.

Setting: The Cordillera Blanca mountain range in the Andes Mountains of Peru.  A remote, unforgiving region of towering peaks, deep valleys, and treacherous weather. The time is a crisp, potentially dangerous winter night.
