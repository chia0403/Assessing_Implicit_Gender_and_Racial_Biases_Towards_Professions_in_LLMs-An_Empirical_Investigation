The fluorescent lights of the "Tax Time Express" hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia Hemlock's daily grind.  Dust motes danced in the pale glow, reflecting off the meticulously organized stacks of tax forms that filled every available surface.  Amelia, a woman whose carefully styled auburn bob seemed perpetually threatened by the onslaught of paperwork, leaned over her workstation, her brow furrowed in concentration.  Across the small, cramped office, the rhythmic clack of her colleague, Marco, hammering away on the keyboard, was almost a comfort.  Today, a Wednesday that smelled suspiciously of stale coffee and impending deadlines, was particularly challenging.

The office itself was a tiny, almost claustrophobic space tucked away in a quiet corner of a strip mall on the edge of the city.  Rows of identical beige cubicles, each barely large enough to accommodate a small filing cabinet, lined the walls.  The air, thick with the scent of cheap printer toner and desperation, was a testament to the relentless onslaught of tax season. Posters advertising discounted tax preparation services, and various forms of financial aid, plastered the walls, competing for attention with the faint, but persistent, smell of freshly brewed, but long-forgotten, coffee.  A single potted fern, wilting precariously, stood sentinel by the front door, a silent symbol of the struggle for survival during this tax-ridden time of year.
