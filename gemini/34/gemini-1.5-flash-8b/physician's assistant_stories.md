The fluorescent lights of the emergency room hummed a monotonous tune, a stark counterpoint to the frantic whispers and the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the cardiac monitor.  Dr. Eleanor Vance, Physician's Assistant, leaned against the cool metal of the examination table, her brow furrowed in concentration.  The air hung thick with the smell of antiseptic and fear.  Outside, the city roared, a symphony of sirens and distant traffic, a stark contrast to the hushed tension within the room.  Eleanor,  a woman whose usually sharp features were softened by the late-night weariness, felt the familiar knot tightening in her stomach.  This was another one of those nights.


Setting: A bustling, inner-city emergency room on a Friday night.  The air was thick with the scent of disinfectant and desperation.  Rows of medical equipment lined the walls, casting long shadows that danced with the flickering fluorescent lights. The rhythmic beep of machines and the muffled sounds of urgent conversations filled the air.   A constant flow of patients, some visibly injured, others just frightened, moved through the room.  Outside, the city pulsed with life, oblivious to the drama unfolding within the sterile walls of the hospital.
