The biting November wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's sweat-soaked hair across her face as she surveyed the deserted park.  Grey clouds hung low, mirroring the mood of the few stragglers still lingering on the frosty benches.  Amelia, a vibrant 29-year-old with a cascade of auburn curls and eyes that sparkled with both passion and pragmatism, adjusted the strap of her worn-but-loved Lululemon backpack.  It held her water bottle, a well-loved copy of "The Power of Now," and a half-eaten energy bar.  The park, normally bustling with the rhythm of morning joggers and families pushing strollers, was a ghost town this early Tuesday.  Even the squirrels seemed to have vanished.


The setting:  A sprawling, leaf-strewn park in the heart of a mid-sized, somewhat overcast Northeastern American city.  The air crackled with the electric anticipation of a coming storm, though the sky held back the deluge with a grudging tension. Buildings of varying architectural styles, from towering modern skyscrapers to quaint Victorian row houses, formed a backdrop, their windows reflecting the subdued light. The park, with its winding paths, sprawling lawns, and ancient oak trees, provided a stark contrast to the hustle and bustle of the city's core.
