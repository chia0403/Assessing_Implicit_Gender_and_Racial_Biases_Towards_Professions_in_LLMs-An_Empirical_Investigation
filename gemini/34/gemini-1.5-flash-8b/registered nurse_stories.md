The fluorescent hum of the emergency room was a constant, low thrum beneath the cacophony.  Dr. Eleanor Vance, RN, adjusted her Scrubs, the familiar polyester a comforting weight against the dampness clinging to her skin.  The air hung thick with the metallic tang of blood and the sterile, antiseptic smell of disinfectant, a familiar yet always unsettling perfume of the hospital.  Outside, the city roared, a relentless symphony of sirens and traffic, a sound she’d become intimately acquainted with over the twelve years she’d dedicated to the ER at St. Jude’s.  Tonight, though, the roar seemed amplified, amplified by the sense of dread tightening in her chest.  It wasn't just the usual flurry of broken bones and twisted limbs, the heart-stopping arrivals with labored breaths.  Tonight, something felt...wrong.  The numbers were mounting, a disturbing trend of patients presenting with similar symptoms, symptoms no one quite understood.  The initial assumption of a mass-exposure incident was being ruled out, but the growing list of victims, the baffling lack of a clear culprit, left a gnawing unease, a sense of the unknown lurking just beyond the sterile walls.  The fluorescent lights seemed to intensify the shadows dancing in the corners, painting macabre patterns on the tired faces of the anxious staff.
