The relentless Arizona sun beat down on Elias Ramirez, shimmering off the cracked asphalt like a thousand tiny, cruel eyes.  Dust devils, the colour of burnt cinnamon, danced across the endless expanse of I-10, swirling around the dilapidated roadside maintenance shed.  Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of diesel fumes and old grease, a scent Elias, a highway maintenance worker for the Arizona Department of Transportation, knew intimately.  His name, etched into the worn leather of his work gloves, was a quiet testament to the miles and the moments spent wrestling with the scorching desert.  He was Elias Ramirez, and today, another section of the highway was his responsibility.  The cracked pavement, a fractured landscape mirroring the inner turmoil in his soul, stretched before him, an endless, shimmering panorama.  His work boots crunched on the gravel, a dull percussion against the desolate silence.
