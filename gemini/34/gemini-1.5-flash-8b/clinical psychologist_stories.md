Dr. Eleanor Vance, a clinical psychologist with a practiced air of calm despite the throbbing headache hammering behind her eyes, adjusted the strap of her worn leather satchel.  The rhythmic *click-click* of the clock on the wall seemed to mock the quiet desperation in the room.

Veridian was a city built on the precipice of progress, a gleaming metropolis nestled in a valley choked by towering, ever-expanding corporations.  The gleaming skyscrapers, reflecting the relentless sun, cast long shadows over the winding streets, where the air hung thick with the scent of ozone and cheap synthetic coffee.  Dr. Vance's office, nestled in a quiet side street, felt a world away from the relentless pulse of the city.  Despite the city’s promise, the cracks in the facade – the anxieties, the loneliness, the overwhelming sense of disconnect – were all she saw.  She saw them in the faces of the people who sat waiting, and she saw them in herself, a weight settling in her chest. Today’s appointment was particularly concerning.  A young man, barely twenty, named Liam Riley, had arrived hours early, eyes wide with an unsettling intensity.
