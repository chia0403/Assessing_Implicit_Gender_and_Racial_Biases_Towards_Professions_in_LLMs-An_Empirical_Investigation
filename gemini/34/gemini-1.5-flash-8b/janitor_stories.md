The fluorescent hum of the library, a constant, low thrumming, was the only sound that broke the silence of the deserted stacks.  Dust motes, illuminated by the harsh glare of the overhead lights, danced in the air, mimicking the frantic whirls of Elias Thorne, the nighttime janitor.  Elias Thorne, a man whose life was a quiet symphony of mopping and scrubbing, of emptying overflowing wastebaskets and restocking library shelves, now found himself lost in a labyrinth of whispered secrets and forgotten stories.


The library itself, a sprawling behemoth of aged oak and towering bookshelves, breathed with a silent, ancient history.  Sunlight, filtered through stained glass windows depicting scenes of mythical creatures, painted the polished floors in shifting patterns of gold and amber.  During the day, it was a haven of quiet contemplation, a sanctuary for students poring over texts and professors lost in their research.  But at night, it was Elias's personal kingdom, a realm of shadowed corners and forgotten whispers.
