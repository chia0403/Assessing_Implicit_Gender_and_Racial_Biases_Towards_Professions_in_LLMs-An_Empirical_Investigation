The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual, murky beige, hummed with the faint, metallic thrum of the city.  Sunlight, fractured and distorted by the grime-coated windowpanes, painted uneven stripes across the tiny salon, “Nails & Nonsense,” a name Amelia Dubois felt both ridiculous and strangely apt.  Amelia, a manicurist with a soul as vibrant as the fuchsia she favored for spring pedicures, adjusted the tiny, star-shaped file in her manicured hand.  The rhythmic clicking echoed in the sterile space, a counterpoint to the muted jazz wafting from a cracked boombox in the corner.  Across the room, a lone customer, Mrs. Periwinkle, sat hunched over her chipped nail polish, muttering about the price of avocados.  Amelia sighed, the faint scent of lemon and disinfectant swirling around her.  Another Tuesday.  Another day to coax beauty from broken things.
