The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine and overripe mangoes.  Sunlight, filtered through the dense foliage of the mango trees lining the alley, painted the cobblestones in shifting patterns of light and shadow.  Dr. Isabella "Izzy" Rodriguez, a registered dietitian with a PhD in nutritional science, squinted, adjusting her straw hat.  The narrow, winding alley, barely wide enough for a bicycle, was a far cry from the sterile white walls and gleaming stainless steel of her university lab. Yet, here, in the heart of the bustling, chaotic market district of San Juan, lay the key to understanding the evolving dietary needs of the city's diverse population.  Izzy, armed with her meticulously organized notebook and a thermos filled with hibiscus tea, was on the hunt for the perfect blend of indigenous ingredients to create a sustainable, affordable, and nutritious meal for the city's growing street vendor community.
