The chill of the pre-dawn air, thick with the scent of pine needles and damp earth, snaked through the corridors of the Whispering Woods Sanctuary.  Elara Vance, Animal Caretaker extraordinaire, adjusted the frayed collar of her worn, navy-blue jacket, the faint glow of the moon illuminating the dew-kissed leaves clinging to the ancient oaks surrounding the grounds.  The sanctuary, nestled deep within the heart of the Black Forest, was a haven for creatures both majestic and minuscule, a place where the whispers of the forest mingled with the soft snores of a slumbering badger and the chirping of unseen crickets. Elara loved this place, the way the moss clung to the stone walls, the way the faintest sounds spoke of the life teeming around her.  Tonight, however, the silence was unnerving, a hush deeper than the usual, pre-dawn calm.  A single, flickering light pulsed from the back of the Sanctuaryâ€™s most prized exhibit, a complex series of underground caves housing a colony of endangered Whispering Owls.  Something was amiss.
