The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Blackwood's hands, the steam curling in the frigid air of the attic room.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom, illuminating a scattering of ancient books, their spines brittle and faded, whispering tales of forgotten lives.  Amelia, a writer of Gothic romances, whose pen name, "Lady Ashworth," charmed readers with her tales of shadowy castles and clandestine lovers, found herself unexpectedly trapped. Not in a romance, mind you, but in the very reality she so painstakingly crafted.  The attic, normally a sanctuary of inspiration, was tonight a suffocating cage.  Outside, the rhythmic drumming of rain against the old Victorian's eaves sounded like a relentless heartbeat, a stark counterpoint to the silence that pressed in upon her.  The scent of decaying wood and old paper hung heavy in the air, a scent that evoked both the magic and the mystery she so passionately pursued.  Her latest manuscript, "The Crimson Courtesan," lay open on the rickety wooden table beside her, its words seeming to mock her from the page.  Amelia knew, with a chilling certainty, that this wasn't just a writer's block. This was something else entirely.  The house itself feltâ€¦ watchful.
