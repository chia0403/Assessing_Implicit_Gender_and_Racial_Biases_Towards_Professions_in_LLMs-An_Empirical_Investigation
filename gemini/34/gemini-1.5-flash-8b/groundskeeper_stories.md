The chipped paint on the wrought-iron gate, a dull, rusted ochre, seemed to mock Bartholomew "Barty" Finch as he wrestled with it.  The latch, a stubborn sliver of metal, resisted his efforts, each tug a futile dance against the encroaching twilight.  Outside, the grand estate of Blackwood Manor stretched, a silent, brooding presence under a sky bruised with the slate-grey hues of a late autumn evening.  Dust motes, disturbed by the swirling wind, danced in the single shaft of light filtering through the gaps in the overgrown ivy that clawed at the stone walls. Barty, his weathered hands calloused and stained a deep brown, swore under his breath.  Another stubborn gate.  Another task added to the endless list that weighed down his shoulders, a list that seemed to grow longer with every passing day.  He adjusted his worn gardening hat, its brim pulled low over his eyes, and sighed.  He knew the manor would be expecting him.
