The chipped paint of the "Shear Genius" sign sagged precariously above the doorway, mirroring the wilting fern by the counter.  Rain hammered against the corrugated metal roof, a relentless percussion against the muted hum of the old, sputtering refrigerator.  Inside, Amelia "Amy"  Carter, a woman sculpted from years of late-night trims and whispered secrets, meticulously snipped a strand of auburn hair.  The salon, a small, cramped space crammed with overflowing shelves of hair products and the faint scent of lavender and old cigarettes, was her sanctuary, her world.  Rain lashed against the windows, painting streaks of grey across the dusty city landscape.  Today, the city seemed to be holding its breath, the kind of stillness that promised a storm brewing, mirroring the unease simmering beneath Amy's skin.  Sheâ€™d had a feeling of something momentous about to shift, a quiet anticipation that felt as heavy as the lead weights she used to keep her shears balanced.
