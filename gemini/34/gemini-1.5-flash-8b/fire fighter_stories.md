The biting wind, a skeletal hand clawing at the tattered awning of the fire station, whipped Amelia "Storm"  Fitzwilliam's hair across her face.  The air, thick with the metallic tang of smoke, tasted like regret.  Another fire, another building reduced to ash, another story etched onto the city’s already-grizzled face.  The flickering neon sign of the "Golden Hour Diner," usually a beacon of comforting warmth, cast a sickly yellow glow on the scene, contrasting sharply with the ominous crimson smear against the sky.  This one smelled different, though.  A sickly sweet, almost cloying aroma hung in the air, a perfume of impending disaster that sent a shiver down Storm's spine.

The fire station, a squat, brick building nestled in the heart of the grimy, industrialized section of the city known as the Foundry District, was a monument to resilience.  Rusty fire trucks, their bodies scarred from countless battles, lined the cobbled alleyways.  The worn leather seats of the cramped break room bore the weight of countless late nights, the lingering scent of sweat, burnt coffee, and the faint, persistent echo of sirens.  The air buzzed with the low hum of conversations and the distant crackle of the city's heart – a city which was slowly, relentlessly, succumbing to decay.  Storm’s boots crunched on the gravel as she made her way towards the dispatch.  The city held its breath. The silent anticipation before the storm.
