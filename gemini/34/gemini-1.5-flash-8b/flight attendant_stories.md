The humid air hung heavy in the galley, thick with the cloying scent of jasmine tea and fear.  Amelia "Amy" Cartwright, her uniform a crisp, sky-blue against the stainless steel, felt the familiar tightening in her chest.  Flight 742, a trans-Pacific jaunt from Seoul to San Francisco, was nearing its descent, but the tension in the cabin wasn't easing.  Not for her, not for the passengers.  Amy, in her three years as a flight attendant, had seen her fair share of turbulence, both the physical and emotional kind, but thisâ€¦this felt different.  Precipitous.

The setting was the cramped, fluorescent-lit galley of a Boeing 787, minutes from touchdown. Outside, the California coastline, a shimmering ribbon of silver and turquoise, was visible through the panoramic windows.  Inside, the air buzzed with the low hum of the engines and the hushed whispers of anxious passengers, their eyes fixed on the rapidly diminishing clouds below.  A palpable sense of unease hung in the air, heavier than the recycled cabin air.  A knot of dread settled in Amy's stomach, mirroring the rising anxiety she felt for the passengers she was responsible for.
