The scaffolding, a precarious lattice against the brilliant morning sun, seemed to writhe with an unspoken tension, a danger barely concealed beneath the veneer of progress.  She squinted, her gaze tracing the frayed ropes and rusted welds.  Something felt off, and not just the usual unsettling hum of a construction site pushing against its limits.
