The biting wind whipped across the desolate expanse of the Badlands, stinging Amelia "Millie" Cartwright's cheeks.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of ochre and grey, danced across the cracked earth, swirling around the hulking behemoth of a bulldozer, affectionately nicknamed "The Ironclad" by Millie.  The year was 2042.  A creeping desertification had claimed vast swathes of the American West, leaving behind a landscape both beautiful and brutal, scarred by the relentless advance of sand and sun.  Millie, her hands calloused and stained the colour of dried blood, wrestled the controls of The Ironclad.  The sun, a cruel eye in the pale sky, beat down relentlessly, highlighting the intricate network of cracks spiderwebbing across the parched ground.  This wasn't the fertile farmland of her childhood, not the lush green valleys she remembered from her youth. This was the frontier, a battleground of survival waged against the relentless forces of nature.  The air, thick with the metallic tang of burnt earth and the metallic tang of burnt diesel, seemed to compress around her, mirroring the suffocating pressure in her own chest.  Her mission: to clear a path through the shifting dunes for the long-awaited, and desperately needed, water pipeline.  Every tremor from the heavy machinery seemed to vibrate through her bones.  The future of this remote, forgotten valley, the future of the scattered settlements clinging to existence, rested on her weary shoulders, on the massive steel arms of The Ironclad, and on the relentless, unforgiving power of the relentless desert.
