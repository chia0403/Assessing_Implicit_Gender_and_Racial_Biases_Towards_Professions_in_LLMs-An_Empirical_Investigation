The flickering neon sign of the "Rusty Spoon" cast a sickly yellow glow over Amelia Blackwood's face, highlighting the faint freckles scattered across her nose.  The air inside was thick with the smells of stale beer, fried onions, and desperation.  Amelia, a slender woman with eyes the color of stormy seas, adjusted the worn leather strap of her guitar case. Tonight, the "Rusty Spoon" was her stage, its chipped Formica tables her audience.  A single spotlight, harsh and unforgiving, illuminated the microphone stand.  The music from the jukebox, a relentless parade of 80s power ballads, thrummed against the low hum of conversation and the clinking of glasses.  Tonight, Amelia hoped to make a connection, to find a chord with the lonely souls gathered within these rust-stained walls.  She was Amelia Blackwood, and this was her lonely symphony.
