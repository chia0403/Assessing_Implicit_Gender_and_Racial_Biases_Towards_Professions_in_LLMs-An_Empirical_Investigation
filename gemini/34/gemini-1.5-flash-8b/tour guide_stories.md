The biting wind whipped Amelia "Ash" Ashworth's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks like a thousand tiny ice needles.  Below, the cobbled streets of Prague snaked between towering medieval buildings, each a miniature fortress clinging to the hill.  A thick fog, clinging to the damp stonework, obscured the city in a pearly, ethereal haze.  Ash,  her breath misting in the frigid air, adjusted the strap of her worn leather satchel.  It contained not only her meticulously prepared tour guide notes, but also the crumpled, handwritten itinerary she’d received from her ailing grandmother, a woman whose knowledge of Prague’s hidden histories was legendary.  This was the final leg of her pilgrimage – a journey to unearth the whispered secrets of her family's past, a journey that had led her to the very heart of this ancient city. The cobblestone path beneath her feet, worn smooth by centuries of footsteps, vibrated with a silent energy that seemed to hum with unspoken stories. Her current tour group, a gaggle of tourists chattering in different languages, was blissfully unaware of the weight of history pressing down on the cobblestones. Their chatter faded into the background as the faint melody of a street musician drifted on the wind. Ash caught a glimpse of a shadowed figure huddled beneath the archway of a nearby church, and a sudden thrill of anticipation, mingled with a touch of unease, prickled at her skin.  This was more than just a tour; this was a quest.
