The flickering fluorescent lights of the Blackwood Public Library hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rustling of pages and the occasional cough echoing through the cavernous space.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun piercing the grime-coated windowpanes, illuminating a precise arrangement of Dewey Decimal System cards â€“ a testament to order in a world that often felt chaotic.  Elara Blackwood, a librarian with eyes the colour of faded parchment and a perpetually tired smile, adjusted the worn leather strap of her satchel.  Her name, a stark echo of the town's name, was often whispered in hushed tones by the patrons who frequented the library's hallowed halls.  She was, to them, a keeper of secrets, a silent guardian of forgotten tales.
