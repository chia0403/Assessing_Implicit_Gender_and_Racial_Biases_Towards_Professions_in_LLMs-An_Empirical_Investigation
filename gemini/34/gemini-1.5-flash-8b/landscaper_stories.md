The biting November wind whipped across the manicured lawns of Blackwood Manor, tugging at Elias Thorne's tweed jacket and rattling the loose gravel in the wheelbarrow.  The scent of pine needles, already tinged with the crisp, metallic tang of frost, hung heavy in the air.  Blackwood Manor, perched atop a hill overlooking the sprawling valley, was a fortress of imposing grey stone, its windows like cold, vacant eyes staring out at the encroaching winter.  Elias, a landscaper with hands calloused from years of shaping earth and tending to the finest blooms, pushed the wheelbarrow further down the long driveway, the rhythmic clinking of the metal against the gravel a lonely counterpoint to the relentless wind.  He'd been hired to assess the damage from the recent storm, a task made all the more daunting by the grandeur of the estate and the rumours swirling about its reclusive owner.
