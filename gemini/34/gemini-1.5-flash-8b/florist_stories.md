The chipped porcelain sink, stained a faded rose by years of spilled water and crushed petals, reflected the flickering gaslight above Amelia Rose Hawthorneâ€™s head.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light slicing through the gloom of her tiny shop, "Blooms of the Borough."  Outside, the wind howled a mournful symphony against the grimy brick walls of the alley, a stark contrast to the delicate, fragrant world Amelia cultivated within.  The air, thick with the heady scent of lilies and jasmine, hummed with a quiet energy, a life force Amelia felt deeply connected to.  She was a creature of the blooms, her fingers, usually stained with vibrant pigments and delicate greens, now tracing the delicate lines of a wilting orchid.  The orchid, a gift from a client, Sir Reginald Featherstone, was a rare specimen, its petals shimmering with an almost ethereal luminescence.  But tonight, even the most precious bloom seemed to sigh with the same melancholy as the wind.  A single, crimson drop of dew, somehow, clung to one of the petals.  It pulsed with an inner light, a flicker of something almost otherworldly.
