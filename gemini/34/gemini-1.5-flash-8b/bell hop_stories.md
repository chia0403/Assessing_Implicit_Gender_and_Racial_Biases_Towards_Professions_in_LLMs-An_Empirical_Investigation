The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the cobblestones of the Grand Magnolia Hotel, illuminating the meticulously polished brass of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's bellhop uniform.  Dust motes, like tiny, ethereal butterflies, swirled in the humid air, carried on the sighing gusts that seemed to whisper secrets through the ornate archways of the hotel's entrance.  Rain hammered against the imposing copper roof, a relentless percussion that punctuated the hushed anticipation of the night.  Barty, a lanky young man with eyes that held the soft, melancholic gleam of a summer sky, adjusted his crisp white gloves.  Tonight was the annual Rose Ball, and the Grand Magnolia buzzed with a feverish energy that echoed in the very bones of the building.  Each guest, each arrival, carried a sliver of the grand, glittering illusion that was the city's social season.  But Barty,  while keen to observe the spectacle, felt a deep sense of quiet detachment, more interested in the stories whispered by the worn, leather-bound books tucked away in his room than the extravagant gowns and diamond necklaces that graced the hotel's corridors.
