The flickering fluorescent lights of the abandoned radio telescope hummed, casting long, dancing shadows across Elias Thorne's workbench.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single overhead bulb, swirled in the air like tiny, spectral dancers.  Elias, a radio technician with calloused hands and eyes that held the quiet intensity of a seasoned astronomer, meticulously adjusted a complex array of wires and components.  The telescope, affectionately known as "The Eye" by the dwindling crew of the Observatory at Cold Creek, sat silent and unblinking, its massive dish reflecting the pale, dying light of the setting sun.  The vast expanse of the desolate, windswept plains of the Montana Badlands stretched out before him, a tapestry of ochre and grey, punctuated by jagged rock formations that seemed to whisper ancient secrets to the wind.  Elias, forty-two years old, felt the familiar ache in his back, the constant reminder of countless hours spent beneath this unforgiving sky.
