The chipped porcelain doll, eyes like faded violets, stared blankly at the swirling grey clouds outside the window.  A single, stubborn ray of sunlight pierced the gloom, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air.  This was Amelia Blackwood's sanctuary, her studio, tucked away on the cobbled alley behind the Grand Cathedral of Whispers in the ancient city of Aethelgard.  Stone buildings, weathered and stained with the colours of forgotten ages, pressed in around her, their shadowed facades whispering tales of generations past.  Amelia, a young artist with eyes the colour of stormy seas and a spirit as restless as the wind, was hunched over her easel, charcoal dust clinging to her cheekbones.  Around her, canvases lay like scattered maps of dreams, each depicting a different vision of Aethelgard.
