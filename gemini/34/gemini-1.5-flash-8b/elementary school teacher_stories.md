The fluorescent lights of Ms. Eleanor Vance's third-grade classroom hummed, a constant, irritating drone that seemed to vibrate through the very desks.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sunbeams slanting through the grimy, window-pane-streaked windows, illuminating the swirling patterns of crayon dust on the worn linoleum floor.  This wasn't the pristine, picture-perfect classroom of Eleanor's idealized teaching fantasies; this was Mrs. Gable's third-grade, a room perpetually teetering on the edge of chaos.  Empty juice boxes and crumpled paper airplanes lay scattered amongst piles of colorful construction paper, the faint scent of glue and something vaguely sweet clinging to the air.  At the front of the room, Eleanor, a woman with a perpetually tired smile and eyes that held the faintest glimmer of hope, wrestled with a particularly unruly pile of misspelled words taped to the whiteboard.  Today's lesson was on synonyms, a concept that seemed to evade her students with the same tenacity as the mischievous spirit of the room.
