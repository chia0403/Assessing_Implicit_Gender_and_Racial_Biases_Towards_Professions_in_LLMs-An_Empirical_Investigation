Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the dilapidated warehouse, a relentless drumming that mirrored the frantic rhythm in Amelia “Ash” Ashworth’s chest.  The air, thick with the smell of mildew and something vaguely metallic, hung heavy in the musty space.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light slicing through the gloom, illuminating the scattered debris – broken crates, discarded tools, and a single, faded photograph lying half-buried in the grime.  This was the abandoned 'Ironclad' workshop, the supposed location of the missing antique automaton, a priceless commission from the eccentric Baroness von Stein.

Ash, a private investigator with eyes the color of storm clouds and a sharp, almost brittle demeanor, knelt beside the photograph.  It depicted a young woman, her face obscured by shadow, clutching a delicate, intricate automaton shaped like a raven.  The date was etched into the faded border: 1887.  Ash traced the outline of the raven’s wing, her fingers catching on a loose gear.  This was no simple lost trinket. This was a challenge, and a potential treasure.
