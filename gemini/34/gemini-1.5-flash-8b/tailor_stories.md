The biting London fog, a thick, grey shroud clinging to the cobbled streets, seemed to seep into the very marrow of Bartholomew "Barty" Finch, tailor.  He hunched deeper into the threadbare armchair in his tiny, dimly lit shop, The Needle's Eye, situated on a forgotten alley off Fleet Street.  A single flickering gas lamp cast long, dancing shadows across the meticulously arranged bolts of fabric â€“ silks the colour of sunset, velvets the depth of midnight, woolens the warm hues of a crackling hearth.  Barty, a man weathered by years of thread and measure, sighed, the sound lost in the mournful whisper of the wind.  His fingers, nimble and calloused, traced the intricate pattern of a faded, embroidered handkerchief, the faded floral design a stark contrast to the city's relentless grey.  Tonight, the city held its breath, awaiting the arrival of the next significant event that would weave its way into the fabric of London.  Barty knew he was not immune, no matter how secluded his shop might seem.
