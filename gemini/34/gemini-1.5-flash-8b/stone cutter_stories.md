The rasping shriek of the chisel biting into stone echoed across the valley, a mournful counterpoint to the bleating of goats and the distant chime of a church bell.  Dust, the colour of aged parchment, swirled around Elara Stonehand, clinging to the ragged edges of her worn leather apron.  The sun, a pale disc behind the jagged peaks of the Grey Mountains, cast long, skeletal shadows across the quarry floor.  Elara, a woman whose face, carved as deeply as the stone she worked, bore the marks of a lifetime spent toiling in the unforgiving embrace of the earth, felt the familiar ache in her arms, the dull throb in her temples.  This was her world, the heart of the Whispering Cliffs quarry, a place where the echoes of centuries past seemed to whisper in the very stones themselves.  She was a stone cutter, a sculptor of silent monuments, and today, the monument she was fashioning was meant to bear a legend, a tale as old as the mountains themselves.
