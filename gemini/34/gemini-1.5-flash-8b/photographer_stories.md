The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood’s camera bag across her shoulders, stinging her cheeks with icy rain.  The old Victorian house, perched precariously on the edge of Blackwood Cliff, seemed to lean into the storm, its darkened windows like vacant eyes staring out at the churning grey sea.  Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless percussion that echoed the frantic rhythm in Amelia’s chest.  She was late.  Very, very late.  Her subject, the elusive, reclusive artist known only as Silas Blackwood, had a reputation for punctuality as rigid as his art was unconventional.  And Amelia, a photographer with a reputation for impeccable timing and even more impeccable nerve, was about to find out if her reputation would hold up against the unforgiving elements and the unpredictable nature of the Blackwood family legacy.

The setting: Blackwood Cliff, a windswept promontory jutting out into the churning grey expanse of the North Atlantic.  The air hung thick with the scent of salt and pine, a constant reminder of the untamed beauty and brutal power of the sea.  The area itself was steeped in local legend, whispers of buried treasure, spectral figures, and the melancholic tales of the Blackwood family, a lineage both celebrated and cursed for their artistic brilliance and peculiar habits. The old Victorian house, with its decaying facade and overgrown garden, was a concrete testament to a family whose fortunes had ebbed and flowed with the tides of time.
