The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's hair across her face, stinging her cheeks like a thousand tiny needles.  She hunched deeper into the worn leather jacket, the grey London drizzle mirroring the grey landscape of the abandoned factory sprawling before her.  Steel girders, skeletal and rust-eaten, clawed at a bruised, overcast sky.  This was it.  The site for Amelia Blackwood, Architect, the long-awaited, controversial redevelopment project â€“  "The Raven's Wing."  

Amelia, at 32, possessed an almost unnerving dedication to her craft, a belief that buildings held the echoes of stories, both whispered and shouted.  And this factory, this monument to industrial might now reduced to a crumbling husk, held a story she felt compelled to unearth.  The project had already been embroiled in controversy.  The local community, steeped in centuries of history, were vehemently opposed to the sleek, modernist design, arguing that it would erase the character of their neighborhood, a district as old as the city itself.  Amelia, though, saw potential, a chance to create something new while still respecting the past.  This was not just another building; it was a conversation, a dialogue with the very bones of the city itself.
