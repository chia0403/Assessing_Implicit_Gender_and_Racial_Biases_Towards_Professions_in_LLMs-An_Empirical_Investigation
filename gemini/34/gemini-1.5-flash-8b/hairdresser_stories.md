The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual, muted grey from decades of spilled bleach and the inevitable tears of disappointed clients, reflected the harsh fluorescent light of "Scissors & Smiles."  Amelia  "Amy"  Fitzwilliam, her fingers stained a vibrant crimson from the latest batch of red streaks, glanced at her reflection.  Her own hair, a cascade of midnight curls, was a stark contrast to the kaleidoscope of colours currently adorning the heads of her clientele.  The rhythmic clatter of shears against hair, punctuated by the occasional sigh and frustrated mutter, filled the small, almost claustrophobic salon.  Today, the air hummed with a particular tension, an unspoken premonition hanging heavy in the stale scent of hairspray and fear.

The setting was a small, struggling salon in the heart of a bustling, yet decaying, section of the city.  Once a vibrant hub of activity, the neighbourhood had fallen into a slow decline, its once-gleaming storefronts now showing the wear of neglect.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Scissors & Smiles, mimicking the storms brewing within Amy's own heart.  The constant rumble of traffic, a distant echo of a life she desperately longed for, served only to amplify the quiet desperation that settled in the corners of the room.
