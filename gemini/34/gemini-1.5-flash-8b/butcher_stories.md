The scent of blood, aged oak, and something faintly floral hung heavy in the air of the "Bloody Butcher," a shop nestled deep within the shadowed alleys of Old Blackwood.  Rain lashed against the grimy storefront, a constant drumbeat that echoed the relentless rhythm of Bartholomew "Barty" Grimshaw's work.  Barty, a butcher of considerable renown (or infamy, depending on whose tongue you listened to), stood hunched over a gleaming steel table, his broad, calloused hands expertly carving a plump, ruby-red ox roast.  The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the butcher shop, highlighting the intricate network of veins and sinews laid bare on the meat.  Outside, the wind howled through the skeletal branches of ancient trees, stirring the cobwebs that clung to the stained-glass windows, their fragmented images of saints and gargoyles offering little comfort in the encroaching gloom.  Barty, however, felt an almost tangible connection to the meat before him, a kinship forged in years of working with the beasts, a bond that transcended the simple act of butchering.  Tonight, the smell of the ox seemed to whisper tales of distant plains and the arduous journey it had taken to reach this very table.
