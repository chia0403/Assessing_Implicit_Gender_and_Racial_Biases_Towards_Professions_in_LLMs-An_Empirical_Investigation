The biting wind, a relentless rasp against the weathered clapboards of the workshop, whipped sawdust into swirling eddies that danced like phantom sprites around Elias Thorne, Carpenter.  Sunrise, a pale blush across the eastern sky, struggled to pierce the grey shroud clinging to the Appalachian foothills.  Elias, his calloused hands stained a rich, dark brown from days spent coaxing life from knotty pine, hunched over a workbench groaning under the weight of half-finished furniture.  A symphony of creaks and groans, a muted counterpoint to the wind’s lament, echoed through the small, ramshackle building.  This was his sanctuary, his forge, his kingdom – the only space in the world that truly belonged to Elias Thorne.

The workshop, nestled into the side of a craggy mountain, was more cave than cottage.  Rough-hewn timbers, darkened by centuries of exposure to the elements, formed its skeletal frame.  Sunlight struggled to penetrate the thick, grime-coated windows, casting long, skeletal shadows across the strewn tools and half-finished projects.  The air, thick with the scent of pine and aged wood, was punctuated by the faint, earthy aroma of damp earth and the pungent tang of something Elias couldn't quite place.  An ancient, gnarled oak, its roots weaving a tapestry of dark tendrils around the workshop's foundation, seemed to watch over him with silent, knowing eyes.  A tiny stream, trickling down the mountainside, wound its way past the workshop’s crumbling foundation, the constant, rhythmic whisper of running water a comforting lullaby in the otherwise desolate landscape.
