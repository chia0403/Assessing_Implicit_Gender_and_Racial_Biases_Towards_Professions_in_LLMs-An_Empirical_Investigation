Outside her door, whispers of rare dragon scales and ancient Egyptian curses mingled with the clatter of unseen creatures and the sharp scent of pickled gnomes. But within her domain, every shilling, every sickle, every knut was meticulously recorded, balanced, and categorized. It was a thankless, yet vital, job. And Agatha, with her spectacles perched precariously on her nose and her eternally ink-stained fingers, was the glue that held the precarious financial state of Grimble & Sons together.
