Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a flight attendant:

**Setting:**

The galley of a Boeing 777-300ER, somewhere over the vast, icy expanse of the North Atlantic. Outside, the night is a thick, impenetrable black, punctuated only by the distant shimmer of stars, indifferent to the human dramas playing out thousands of feet below. The air inside is artificially warm, a constant 72 degrees Fahrenheit, and recycled. The hum of the engines, a deep, thrumming vibration, is so pervasive that it's become white noise, a part of the very fabric of existence for the crew. The scent of reheated chicken korma mingles uneasily with the antiseptic tang of disinfectant wipes and the subtle, floral perfume that the cabin crew are required to wear.

**Opening:**

"Turbulence ahead," crackled the disembodied voice of Captain Ramirez over the intercom. "Flight attendants, please secure the cabin."

Eleanor "Ellie" Marie Dubois sighed, running a hand through her perfectly coiffed blonde bob. Another rough patch. It wasn't the turbulence that bothered her â€“ she'd weathered worse in her seven years with Global Airways. It was the sudden, sharp intake of breath from Passenger 27B, a middle-aged man with perpetually worried eyes, which made her stomach clench. He'd been staring blankly at the in-flight movie, his grip tightening on the armrest. He was one of *those* passengers, the ones whose anxiety seeped into the air like a silent, invisible fog.

Ellie plastered on her most reassuring smile. "Everything's alright, sir," she said, her voice a practiced blend of authority and genuine concern. "Just a little bump in the road."

But even as the words left her lips, Ellie felt a prickle of unease. The way the captain's voice had sounded, a thread of tension woven beneath the calm professionalism... this felt different. And Ellie Dubois, despite the years of training and forced composure, had learned to trust her gut. Something was about to happen on Flight GA342 to Amsterdam, and it wasn't just going to be bumpy air.
