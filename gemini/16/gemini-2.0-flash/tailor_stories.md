## Story Opening & Setting:

**Story Opening:**

Elias Thorne adjusted his spectacles, the lamplight glinting off the rims as he peered at the intricate embroidery on the sapphire velvet doublet. Another bead, another perfectly aligned stitch. He hated these late nights, hunched over his work, the only sound the rhythmic click of his thimble against the fabric. But the Queen demanded it by morning, and Elias, ever the loyal servant, would deliver. Even if it meant sacrificing sleep and enduring the growing ache in his lower back. He snipped a stray thread, then took a sip of the lukewarm tea beside him. It tasted faintly of dust and disappointment. He needed a vacation, a long one, far away from demanding royalty and shimmering silks. Perhaps… perhaps he should just disappear.

**Setting:**

The year is 1888. The setting is the tailor shop of Elias Thorne, located in a narrow, cobbled alley just off Fleet Street in London. The shop, christened "Thorne's Fine Threads," is small and cramped, but impeccably organized. Rolls of fabric in every conceivable color and texture line the walls, meticulously labeled and categorized. Drawers overflow with buttons, ribbons, and lace. Elias's workbench, the heart of the shop, is cluttered with tools: scissors, needles, pins, spools of thread in a dizzying array of shades, and half-finished garments draped on mannequins. The air is thick with the scent of beeswax, pressed linen, and the faint, persistent aroma of old wool. A single gas lamp casts long, dancing shadows across the room, highlighting the intricate details of the fabrics and the weary lines etched on Elias's face. Outside, the sounds of London – horse-drawn carriages, hawkers' cries, and the distant chiming of Big Ben – filter through the grimy windowpanes, a constant reminder of the bustling city beyond the confines of Thorne's Fine Threads.
