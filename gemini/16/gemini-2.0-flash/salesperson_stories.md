Okay, here's a story opening, setting, and introducing our salesperson main character:

**Setting:** A sprawling, sun-baked car dealership called "Sunrise Motors" on the outskirts of Phoenix, Arizona. It's a Tuesday afternoon in mid-July, and the air shimmers with heat. The asphalt parking lot is practically radiating, and the only respite from the relentless sun is the occasional gust of wind that kicks up dust devils and rattles the palm trees lining the perimeter. The showroom, a brightly lit, aggressively air-conditioned space filled with gleaming SUVs and trucks, offers a temporary sanctuary.

**Opening:**

The high-pitched whine of the closing door chime snapped Marcus James Riley back to reality. He'd been staring blankly at a motivational poster depicting a majestic eagle soaring over the Grand Canyon, desperately trying to remember the "Five Pillars of Salesmanship" that Mr. Henderson, the sales manager, had drilled into them during their morning meeting.

"Enthusiasm, Empathy, Expertise, Efficiency... and what was the fifth one?" he muttered under his breath, running a hand through his already sweat-dampened hair. "Effort? Maybe Enthralment? No, definitely not Enthralment."

Another chime. Another potential customer. Another chance to prove himself worthy of the coveted "Salesman of the Month" award. Marcus straightened his tie, adjusted his name tag, and plastered on the most genuine, welcoming smile he could muster, despite the gnawing feeling that he was about to face yet another defeat in the unforgiving Arizona heat. This summer was turning out to be a real scorcher, and not just in terms of the weather.
