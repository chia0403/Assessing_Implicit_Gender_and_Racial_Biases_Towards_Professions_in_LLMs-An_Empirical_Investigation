## Story Opening:

The metallic tang of salt spray kissed the lens of Eleanor Rose Thorne's Hasselblad, a familiar sensation she welcomed like a loverâ€™s breath. Above her, the gulls screeched a discordant chorus, mirroring the frantic flutter in her chest. Not from fear, no. Eleanor hadn't felt fear in years, not since she'd stared into the face of a dying tiger in the jungles of Cambodia. This was something else entirely. This was anticipation, a primal hum that vibrated in her bones, amplified by the sheer, brutal beauty of the scene before her.

The sun, a molten coin sinking towards the horizon, painted the churning Atlantic in hues of blood orange and bruised purple. Towering waves, capped with frothy white manes, crashed against the jagged, black rocks that lined the shore of Puffin's Rest Island, their thunderous roar a constant, deafening symphony. The air hung thick with the promise of an approaching storm, and Eleanor knew, with a certainty that felt ancient and ingrained, that tonight, something extraordinary was going to happen. Something she needed to capture.

She adjusted the aperture, her gloved fingers numb despite the fleece lining. Puffin's Rest wasn't known for its hospitality, especially not in November. But the stories... the whispers... they had drawn her here, across the choppy waters and into the teeth of the approaching squall. The locals spoke of lights dancing on the waves, of whispers carried on the wind, of a presence both benevolent and terrifying. Eleanor didn't believe in ghosts, not really. But she believed in the power of place, in the secrets held within the bones of the earth. And tonight, she intended to unlock them.

## Setting:

**Puffin's Rest Island, off the coast of Northern Ireland, November.** A remote, windswept island with a small, dwindling population. The landscape is dominated by jagged cliffs, black basalt rocks, and sparse, hardy vegetation clinging to life in the salty air. The island's only settlement, a village called Oakhaven, consists of a handful of weathered stone cottages, a crumbling church, and a single, perpetually understaffed pub. The atmosphere is perpetually gloomy and isolated, steeped in local folklore and whispered tales of the island's past. The sea is a constant presence, both a source of livelihood and a constant threat. The weather is volatile and unpredictable, often changing from calm to tempestuous in a matter of hours.
