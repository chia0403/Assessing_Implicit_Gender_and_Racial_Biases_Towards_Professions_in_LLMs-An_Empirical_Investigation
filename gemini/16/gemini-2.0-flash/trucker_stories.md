Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a story about a trucker:

**Setting:** The sprawling, desolate I-40 highway cutting through the Arizona desert, just west of Winslow, Arizona. It's late August, and the sun is a hammer beating down on the asphalt. The air shimmers with heat, making distant mesas look like mirages. The only signs of life are the occasional gas station, truck stop, and the vultures circling patiently overhead.

**Story Opening:**

The king cab of the Peterbilt, affectionately nicknamed "The Wandering Star," vibrated like a hummingbird's heart. For the thousandth time that day, Jedediah "Jed" Bartholomew swiped at the sweat trickling down his temples with the back of his calloused hand. The air conditioning, bless its wheezing, sputtering heart, was doing its best, but in this godforsaken oven, even a polar bear would be begging for mercy. Jed squinted at the endless ribbon of highway unwinding before him. Another hundred miles of shimmering heat, another hundred miles of loneliness echoing in the cavernous space between the seats.

He thumped a hand against the dash, knocking a miniature hula dancer loose from its sticky pad. It wobbled precariously, a silent testament to the monotonous rhythm of the road. "Almost there, girl," Jed mumbled, his voice gravelly from disuse and countless cups of diner coffee. "Just gotta get this load of avocados to Albuquerque. Then, maybe, just maybe, I can find a decent steak and a cold beer that doesn't taste like desert dust."

He flicked on the CB radio, hoping for a break in the oppressive silence, but all he got was static and the faint, crackling ghost of a conversation he couldn't quite decipher. Sighing, Jed reached for his thermos. Coffee. Lukewarm and bitter, but at least it was something. As he tilted the thermos back, a glint of sun caught on the small, silver chain around his neck. It held a tarnished dog tag, a silent reminder of a life lived before the open road, a life he'd been trying to outrun for far too long. The desert stretched on, indifferent to his burdens, swallowing him whole, mile after lonely mile.
