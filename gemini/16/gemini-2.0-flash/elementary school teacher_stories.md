## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The last rays of a late-September sun were painting the classroom in long, amber stripes. A faint smell of crayons, glue, and vaguely nostalgic institutional cleaner hung in the air. Miss Finch’s classroom, a boxy, beige space in the heart of Meadowbrook Elementary School, looked remarkably untouched by the chaos of the day. Twenty-two small desks stood in neat rows, each bearing the faint imprint of a school year’s worth of elbows and anxieties.
