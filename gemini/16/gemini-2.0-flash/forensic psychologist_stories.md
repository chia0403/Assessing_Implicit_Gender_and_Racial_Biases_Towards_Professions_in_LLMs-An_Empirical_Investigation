## Story Opening & Setting:

**Opening:**

The pungent aroma of decay, masked only slightly by the cloying sweetness of industrial air freshener, clung to Dr. Evelyn Reed's throat. It was a familiar, unwelcome guest. She pulled her scarf higher, a futile attempt to filter the reek, and tightened her grip on her briefcase. Inside, nestled amongst the usual assortment of crime scene photographs and personality assessments, was a half-eaten granola bar, a desperate attempt to fuel herself through what promised to be a long, gruesome day. "Morning, Dr. Reed," a gruff voice rumbled from the shadows. Detective Miller, a man carved from granite and cynicism, greeted her with a nod that barely registered. "Ready to play connect-the-dots with a mind that was clearly broken long before it wasâ€¦" he trailed off, gesturing towards the yellow tape that cordoned off the macabre tableau.

**Setting:**

The story unfolds in the decaying industrial heartland of **Gary, Indiana**. Specifically, this scene takes place inside an abandoned steel mill, or what remains of it. Rust-eaten girders claw at the grey sky through shattered windows. The vast, echoing space is littered with debris: broken machinery, discarded barrels, and shards of glass that sparkle ominously in the dim light filtering through the gaps in the corroded roof. The cold, metallic smell of decay permeates the air, a constant reminder of the city's shattered dreams and the desperate lives that cling to its edges. This particular section of the mill has become a grim stage for a particularly brutal murder, adding another layer of darkness to an already bleak landscape. The air hangs heavy with a palpable sense of despair and forgotten ambition.
