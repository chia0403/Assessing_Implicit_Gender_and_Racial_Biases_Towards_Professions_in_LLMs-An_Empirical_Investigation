Okay, here’s a story opening and setting with a carpenter named...

**Story Opening:**

The scent of cedar and sawdust hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the biting November wind that rattled the windows of Ezekiel Thomas Blackwood's workshop. He blew a stray curl of wood shavings from his salt-and-pepper beard and squinted at the half-finished rocking horse nestled in the vice. Its smooth, curved neck, lovingly shaped over days of careful carving, seemed to gaze back at him with a silent plea for completion. Ezekiel, however, wasn’t feeling particularly cooperative. A knot, not unlike the gnarled one in the oak he’d been wrestling with earlier, had formed in his chest. It tightened every time his gaze drifted to the calendar tacked to the wall, where the 17th of November, bold and unforgiving, stared back at him. Today was the day he’d promised himself he’d start. Today, he was supposed to begin building the ark.

**Setting:**

Ezekiel Thomas Blackwood’s workshop was a chaotic, yet meticulously organized, space. Located in the converted barn behind his small, weather-beaten farmhouse just outside the sleepy, unincorporated town of Havenwood, Montana, it was the heart of his existence. The air perpetually smelled of wood, oil, and beeswax. Walls were lined with tools: gleaming saws, chisels worn smooth with use, hand planes polished to a mirror sheen. Shelves groaned under the weight of lumber – cedar planks stacked alongside walnut boards, lengths of oak leaning against maple – each piece carefully selected for a specific project. Sunlight streamed through the grime-streaked windows, illuminating swirling dust motes and casting long shadows across the workbench, a vast and sturdy expanse scarred with decades of use. A wood-burning stove, nestled in the corner, crackled with warmth, providing a welcome respite from the harsh Montana winters. Outside, the landscape was a tapestry of rolling hills, dotted with patches of snow-dusted pine forests and the occasional glimpse of the winding, icy-blue ribbon of the Havenwood River. It was a place of quiet beauty, a place that whispered of solitude and hard work, a place where Ezekiel felt both utterly at peace and inexplicably restless.
