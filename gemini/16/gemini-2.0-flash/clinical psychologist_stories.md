**Opening:**

The scent of old paper and lavender hung heavy in the air, a cloying comfort that Dr. Evelyn Reed had grown immune to over the years. Outside, the November rain hammered against the tall, narrow windows of her office, a relentless drumbeat echoing the anxieties she often absorbed from her patients. Evelyn sighed, adjusting the perfectly placed throw blanket on the worn velvet chaise lounge. Today was Mrs. Hawthorne's day, a woman whose grief over the loss of her husband had become a permanent fixture in the room, clinging to the air like the persistent floral perfume she always wore. Evelyn checked the antique clock on her desk, its tick a steady counterpoint to the storm raging outside. Three minutes until Mrs. Hawthorne arrived. Just enough time to take another sip of lukewarm Earl Grey and fortify herself for another hour navigating the labyrinth of loss and longing.

**Setting:**

Dr. Evelyn Reed's private practice, "The Reed Clinic for Cognitive and Emotional Wellbeing," was housed in a converted Victorian townhouse on a quiet, tree-lined street in the historic district of Providence, Rhode Island. The building itself was a testament to the city's rich, and sometimes melancholic, past. Inside, Evelyn had attempted to create a soothing and inviting atmosphere, a stark contrast to the cold, sterile environments often associated with medical practices. The waiting room featured plush armchairs upholstered in muted greens and blues, a mahogany table displaying an assortment of current magazines and calming nature books, and soft, instrumental music playing quietly in the background. Her office, however, felt more personal, reflecting her own character and interests. The walls were lined with bookshelves overflowing with psychology textbooks, novels, and poetry collections. Certificates and diplomas hung alongside framed art prints of Impressionist landscapes. A large, comfortable desk faced the chaise lounge, separated by a Persian rug worn smooth with age. The overall effect was one of quiet elegance and understated professionalism, a sanctuary designed to foster trust and encourage vulnerability.
