The damp chill of the theatre clung to Barnaby Quince like a shroud. Outside, Edinburgh buzzed with the frenetic energy of the Fringe Festival, a chaos of flyers, street performers, and desperate actors thrusting their résumés into anyone who looked remotely employable. But inside the faded grandeur of the Assembly Rooms, specifically in the shadowy depths of the King Ballroom, a quiet desperation reigned.

Barnaby Augustine Quince, Artistic Director of the beleaguered "Thespis & Thyme Theatre Company," sat hunched over a table littered with crumpled scripts and half-eaten shortbread. The Ballroom, usually resplendent with chandeliers and polished dance floors, was currently a wasteland of unfinished set pieces: a lopsided Grecian column, a half-painted backdrop depicting a vaguely Mediterranean seascape, and a collection of mismatched chairs that screamed "charity shop chic."

He rubbed his tired eyes. Opening night of "Hamlet: A Highland Rhapsody" was less than 48 hours away, and the only thing less prepared than his cast was his budget. The faint scent of stale beer and ambition hung in the air, a poignant reminder of all the plays that had breathed their last gasps in this very space, swallowed whole by the unforgiving vortex of the Fringe. This year, Barnaby feared, Thespis & Thyme might just be next.
