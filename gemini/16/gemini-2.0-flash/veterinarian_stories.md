## Story Opening & Setting

**Opening:**

Dr. Eleanor Rose Ainsworth traced the rim of her lukewarm coffee with a worn, gloved finger, the steam doing little to alleviate the persistent chill that clung to her bones. Outside, the November wind howled a mournful dirge, rattling the corrugated iron roof of her surgery like a disgruntled ghost. Another emergency call. Another night battling the elements, and the gnawing feeling that she was losing her touch. She hadn’t slept a full night in weeks, not since the rumors started swirling around the village of Hollow Creek, whispers of sicknesses, of unnatural deaths amongst the livestock… Whispers she’d tried to dismiss as rural superstition, but which now, fueled by the urgency in Mrs. Gable's voice just moments ago, sounded chillingly real.

**Setting:**

The story is set in **Hollow Creek, Vermont**, a small, isolated village nestled deep within the Green Mountains. The landscape is dominated by dense forests, rolling hills, and rocky pastures. The village itself is sparsely populated, consisting of a handful of weathered farmhouses, a general store, a post office, and a church, all clustered around a central square. A palpable sense of history and isolation hangs in the air, reinforced by the often-harsh weather and the close-knit, fiercely independent community. Eleanor's veterinary clinic, "Ainsworth Animal Care," is a modest, single-story building on the outskirts of the village, its painted white exterior faded and peeling. It's functional but worn, reflecting Eleanor's dedication to her work and the limited resources available in Hollow Creek. The clinic is surrounded by a small, fenced-in yard where animals can recover and roam freely.
