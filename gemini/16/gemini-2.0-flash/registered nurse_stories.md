The humid Georgia air, thick as sweet tea and just as cloying, clung to Registered Nurse Evelyn Grace Thornton like a second skin. The scent of honeysuckle and something vaguely medicinal – a lingering whisper of Betadine perhaps, from the morning’s shift – drifted through the open windows of her ramshackle, two-story Victorian. Paint peeled like sunburn from the clapboard siding, revealing patches of faded sage green beneath the chipped white. The sprawling porch, littered with wilting ferns and forgotten gardening tools, sagged noticeably on the west side.

Evelyn, still in her navy blue scrubs, sank heavily onto the swing, the rusted chains groaning a mournful tune. It was twilight in the small town of Havenwood, and fireflies were just beginning their lazy dance in the overgrown azalea bushes that lined her property. She kicked off her sensible, well-worn Danskos, the cool wood of the porch a welcome contrast to her aching feet.

This was her sanctuary, her haven in Havenwood. A place where the beeping monitors and hurried whispers of St. Jude’s Hospital faded, replaced by the chirping of crickets and the rustling of leaves in the ancient oak tree that dominated her front yard. But tonight, even the comforting rhythm of the swing couldn't chase away the lingering unease that had settled in her bones since the moment she'd clocked in that morning. Tonight, Havenwood felt less like a sanctuary and more like a waiting room.
