Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a physical therapist named Amelia Rose Hawthorne:

**Setting:** The story opens on a crisp autumn morning in the small, charming town of Havenwood, nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. The air is thick with the scent of woodsmoke and damp leaves, and the vibrant colors of the turning foliage paint the landscape in hues of fiery orange, deep crimson, and golden yellow. Havenwood is the kind of place where everyone knows everyone, and life moves at a slower, more deliberate pace. It's a town steeped in tradition and quiet beauty, but also one with its fair share of secrets and whispered stories. A quaint, two-story brick building, the Hawthorne Physical Therapy Clinic, stands proudly on Main Street, its window boxes overflowing with hardy mums.

**Opening:**

The bell above the door to Hawthorne Physical Therapy Clinic jingled merrily, a sound Amelia Rose Hawthorne knew better than her own heartbeat. She glanced up from the meticulous notes she was making on Mrs. Gable’s knee replacement progress, a small smile tugging at the corner of her lips. The cheerful chime was a comforting rhythm in her often hectic days. Outside, the autumn light was fading, casting long shadows across Main Street.

"Right on time, Mr. Henderson," Amelia said, rising to greet her next patient. The warmth of the office seemed to envelop the older man as he shuffled in, leaning heavily on his cane.

“Wouldn’t miss it, Amelia. These old bones are counting on you,” he replied, his voice raspy but friendly.

As Amelia began to guide him through his exercises, her practiced hands gently adjusting his posture, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was different today. The air felt heavier, the shadows deeper. It wasn't just the onset of a particularly long evening; it was a subtle shift in the fabric of Havenwood itself, a feeling she couldn't quite place, but one that made the hairs on the back of her neck stand on end. A feeling she knew all too well meant trouble was brewing in her quiet little town. Trouble that she, unfortunately, usually ended up being involved in.
