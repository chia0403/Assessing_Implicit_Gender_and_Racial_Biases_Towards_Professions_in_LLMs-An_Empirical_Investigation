Okay, here's a story opening, including the setting and the main character's full name:

**Story Opening & Setting:**

The biting wind, smelling of salt and something indefinably wilder – maybe seaweed rot, maybe untamed freedom – rattled the windowpanes of "The Anchor's Remedy," Bartholomew "Bart" Finch's pharmacy. It was a typical November evening in Port Blossom, a small, stubborn town clinging to the craggy coast of Maine like a barnacle to a hull. Dusk had fallen hours ago, painting the harbor in shades of bruised purple and gunmetal gray. A few fishing boats bobbed restlessly against the docks, their skeletal masts scratching at the fading light.

Bart Finch, the pharmacist of Port Blossom, shivered, pulling his worn, cable-knit cardigan tighter. The ancient heating system in his building, a temperamental beast fueled by oil and spite, seemed determined to keep the temperature just a few degrees below comfortable. He glanced at the clock above the prescription counter: 8:17 PM. Almost closing time. He’d hoped to be home already, brewing himself a pot of Earl Grey and settling in with a good book. But the bell above the door *jingle-jingled*, a sound that always held a strange mix of anticipation and mild dread.
