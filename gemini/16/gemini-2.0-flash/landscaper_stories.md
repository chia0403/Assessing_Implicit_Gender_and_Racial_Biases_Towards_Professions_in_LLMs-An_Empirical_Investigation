## Story Opening:

The smell of freshly cut St. Augustine grass clung to the air, a familiar perfume that both soothed and grated on the nerves of Alistair Finch. He squinted against the Florida sun, wiping sweat from his brow with the back of his gloved hand. Today was Tuesday, which meant meticulously manicuring the sprawling lawns of the Pelican Pointe Country Club, a task he usually found meditative but today felt like a punishment. Mrs. Abernathy, infamous for her microscopic inspection of every blade of grass and rogue dandelion, was due for her weekly drive-by in a few minutes. He could already feel the knots tightening in his stomach. This time, he swore, he wouldnâ€™t let her find a single imperfection. This time, the "Finest Finch Landscaping" reputation would remain unblemished. This time, he just might survive until the weekend.
## Setting:

**Pelican Pointe Country Club, Sarasota, Florida, Present Day:** The sprawling country club is an oasis of manicured green in the otherwise sun-baked landscape of Sarasota. Towering palm trees cast dappled shadows across immaculately kept fairways. Gleaming white golf carts hum along winding paths, carrying tanned and well-heeled members. The air is thick with the scent of saltwater from the nearby bay, mingling with the sharp tang of fertilizer and the sweet aroma of flowering bougainvillea. Sprinklers hiss rhythmically, a constant reminder of the effort required to maintain this picture-perfect facade. The clubhouse, a grand, plantation-style building with white pillars and a wraparound veranda, overlooks the entire scene, a silent testament to wealth and privilege.
