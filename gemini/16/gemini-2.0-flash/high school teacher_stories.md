## Story Opening:

The scent of stale coffee and industrial-strength cleaner clung to the air of the staff room like a persistent ghost. Missed deadlines and the phantom echoes of teenage angst seemed to permeate the very walls. It was a battlefield of forgotten lunchboxes, half-drunk energy drinks, and the simmering resentment of underpaid idealism. Eleanor Abigail Hawthorne surveyed the scene with a weary sigh, clutching a chipped mug depicting a particularly sarcastic-looking Garfield.

Just another Tuesday.

She ran a hand through her already messy bun, dislodging a stray strand of auburn hair. The last bell had only rung twenty minutes ago, but the building felt strangely deserted. She’d deliberately lingered, needing a few moments of quiet contemplation before facing the reality of grading thirty-two essays on the socio-political commentary of *The Hunger Games*.

A faint popping sound pulled her attention to the ancient vending machine in the corner. A pack of peanut M&Ms, bless its sugary heart, had miraculously dislodged itself. Eleanor chuckled, the sound dry and brittle. Even the vending machine was trying to offer her a lifeline. Perhaps today wouldn't be a complete disaster after all. Except… where were her keys?

Panic flickered, a familiar unwelcome guest. She patted her pockets, rummaged through her overflowing tote bag, and checked the cluttered surface of the nearest table. They were nowhere to be found. Again.

Eleanor closed her eyes, picturing the possibilities. Locked out of her car, a long walk home in the impending twilight, and a hungry cat waiting impatiently for her to dish out his nightly Fancy Feast.

Just another Tuesday.

## Setting:

The story unfolds primarily at **Northwood High School**, a sprawling brick building on the outskirts of the quiet, almost unnervingly quaint, town of Oakhaven, Connecticut. Northwood serves a diverse student body, from the children of wealthy suburban families to those struggling to make ends meet. The school itself is a blend of the old and the new, with recently renovated science labs juxtaposed against creaky wooden floors and classrooms that haven't seen a fresh coat of paint in decades.

Specifically, the opening scene takes place in the **staff room**, a cramped and perpetually messy space located between the history and English departments. The room is furnished with mismatched chairs, a couple of worn-out sofas, a communal microwave that smells faintly of popcorn and despair, and the aforementioned ancient vending machine that seems to dispense more disappointment than snacks. A whiteboard covered in illegible scribbles and passive-aggressive reminders hangs precariously on one wall, a testament to the chaotic lives of the teachers who frequent the space. The windows, perpetually grimy, offer a view of the grey, overcast sky that seems to be a permanent fixture in Oakhaven during the autumn months.
