## Story Opening:

The first crack snaked across the alabaster like a spider's silk, barely visible at first. Elias Thorne, a man whose hands were more familiar with granite than caresses, felt a cold sweat prickle his brow. He squinted, holding his breath, willing it to be a trick of the fading afternoon light. But no, there it was, shimmering like a ghostly vein beneath the milky surface. This was no ordinary imperfection. This was a flaw that threatened to unravel weeks, nay, months, of painstaking labor. He closed his eyes, the rhythmic clang of the chisel echoing in his memory, a mockery of the impending failure. This alabaster was destined to be the cornerstone of Lady Beatrice’s fountain, a commission that could solidify his reputation, elevate him from mere stonemason to artist. And now… it might all crumble.

## Setting:

Elias Thorne’s workshop perched on the edge of the Greycliff Quarry, a raw wound in the earth's flesh carved out over generations. The air here was thick with the scent of damp stone and the ever-present dust that coated everything in a fine, ghostly shroud. The workshop itself was a single-roomed affair, built from rough-hewn timbers and patched with scavenged slate. Sunlight, filtered through the dust-laden air, streamed through a single, grimy window, illuminating the tools of Elias’s trade: chisels of varying sizes and sharpness, a heavy-duty mallet worn smooth by years of use, and a collection of rasps and files for the finer details. Scraps of stone littered the floor, a testament to the countless projects completed and discarded. Beyond the workshop window, the quarry sprawled, a labyrinth of jagged edges and precarious ledges, humming with the distant activity of miners and the rhythmic thud of hammers echoing off the cliff faces. Further still, in the far distance, lay the sprawling city of Aethelgard, its spires and towers glinting in the setting sun, a constant reminder of the beauty Elias strived to create from the unforgiving embrace of the Greycliff.
