The air hung thick with the scent of hay, damp earth, and something indefinably… otter-y. Abigail Willowbrook, her hands already stained with the rusty red of beet juice she used to supplement the tortoise’s diet, inhaled deeply. This was home. This was sanctuary. This was the chaotic, beautiful life she’d carved out for herself at the Whispering Pines Wildlife Rehabilitation Center nestled deep in the Oregon Coast Range.

The center itself was a sprawling affair, more ramshackle than refined. A main house, once a grand Victorian farmhouse, served as the administrative hub and housed Abigail’s small apartment on the top floor. Surrounding it were a collection of purpose-built enclosures: a hawk mew with staggered perches, a network of interconnected beaver ponds, and a series of spacious runs shaded by ancient pines for the recovering deer. Beyond that, the forest pressed close, a verdant tapestry woven with secrets and the rustling whispers of unseen creatures.

Abigail, her auburn braid pulled back from her face, surveyed her domain with a critical eye. The morning light filtered through the pines, dappling the enclosures in shifting patterns. A robin chirped a cheery greeting from the branch of a nearby cedar, its melody a comforting constant in the symphony of the wild that always hummed around her. The day had begun, and with it, the endless, rewarding, and often heartbreaking task of nursing the wounded, the orphaned, and the lost back to health. And Abigail Willowbrook wouldn't have it any other way.
