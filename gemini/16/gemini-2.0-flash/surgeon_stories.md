The acrid smell of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, a familiar, almost comforting, aroma that barely registered with Dr. Eleanor Vance as she scrubbed. Five minutes. She’d been timing herself since residency, and her hands, now rough and reddened from years of aggressive washing, were almost raw. Five minutes was the magic number, the ritualistic cleansing that separated the outside world from the sterile bubble of the operating theatre. Tonight, though, even the rigorous routine couldn't quite wash away the unease clinging to her like a second skin.

The hospital, St. Augustine’s Memorial in Providence, Rhode Island, stood sentinel against the stormy backdrop of Narragansett Bay. November winds howled through the city, rattling the windows and whistling through the ancient brickwork of the building. Inside, the modern surgical wing was a stark contrast to the hospital's gothic exterior. Bright, clinical, and fiercely efficient, it hummed with the low thrum of life support machines and the hushed voices of the surgical team. The air was rigidly temperature-controlled, a deliberate dampening of the natural world to create an environment conducive to healing, and survival. Eleanor knew, though, that sometimes, even the most advanced technology couldn't hold back the tide. Especially tonight.
