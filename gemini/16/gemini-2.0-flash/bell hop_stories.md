## Story Opening:

The lobby hummed, a low, expensive drone of hushed conversations, clicking heels, and the occasional tinkling of a champagne flute. Across the polished marble floor, Arthur Bartholomew Finch polished the already gleaming brass handle of the revolving door, his movements practiced and efficient. He knew every nook and cranny of the Grand Majestic Hotel like the back of his perpetually chapped hands, and this small ritual was his quiet moment before the evening rush. He breathed in the scent of lilies and imported leather, a fragrance that always managed to feel both opulent and, somehow, a little lonely. He hated the feeling. Tonight, more than usual, a certain restlessness gnawed at him, a yearning for something more than the endless parade of suitcases and entitled smiles. He just didn’t know what that “more” was, and that was the crux of his particular brand of misery.

## Setting:

The Grand Majestic Hotel is a monument to gilded age grandeur located in the heart of Manhattan, just a stone's throw from Central Park. Its opulent facade, adorned with intricate carvings and a dramatic, floodlit portico, screams old money and understated elegance. Inside, soaring ceilings are draped with crystal chandeliers, casting a warm glow upon richly patterned carpets and antique furniture. The air is always carefully climate-controlled, maintaining a perfect temperature year-round. Each of the hotel's three restaurants boasts a Michelin star, and its rooftop bar offers breathtaking panoramic views of the city. The clientele consists primarily of wealthy tourists, international dignitaries, and celebrities seeking anonymity (though rarely finding it). The staff, meticulously trained and impeccably uniformed, are expected to be both invisible and instantly available, a delicate balancing act that Arthur Bartholomew Finch had mastered years ago, or so he liked to think. Despite the glamour, Arthur always felt a subtle undercurrent of tension, a feeling that something significant was always about to happen, or perhaps already had, just out of sight.
