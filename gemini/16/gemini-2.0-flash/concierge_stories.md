## Opening:

The scent of lilies, subtly laced with the metallic tang of desperation, clung to the air of the Grand Palais Hotel lobby. Arthur Penhaligon smoothed a nonexistent wrinkle from the lapel of his impeccably tailored, midnight blue suit. He’d been working the late shift for nearly eight years, and the cocktail of anxieties and aspirations that swirled around this gilded cage had become as familiar to him as his own reflection in the polished marble floor. Tonight, however, the usual hum of wealthy unease felt amplified, sharpened by a discordant note he couldn't quite place. It felt…wrong. And Arthur Penhaligon, Head Concierge of the Grand Palais, trusted his gut. Tonight, something was brewing beneath the champagne-soaked surface of Paris's elite.

## Setting:

The Grand Palais Hotel, Paris. A Belle Époque masterpiece situated on the Avenue Montaigne, a stone's throw from the Champs-Élysées. Its ornate facade, bathed in the soft glow of strategically placed spotlights, whispered tales of opulence and whispered secrets. Inside, the lobby was a symphony of marble, crystal, and gold. A massive floral arrangement, refreshed daily, dominated the center, while hushed conversations rippled through the room like the melody of a forgotten waltz. Sunlight streamed through stained-glass windows during the day, painting the room in vibrant hues, but at night, the ambiance shifted, becoming more intimate, more clandestine. Plush velvet seating areas invited discreet meetings and whispered deals. The air was perpetually perfumed with the hotel's signature fragrance – a blend of sandalwood, bergamot, and a hint of something utterly unidentifiable, said to be the personal preference of the hotel's enigmatic owner. The Grand Palais wasn't just a hotel; it was a destination, a symbol of status, and a stage for the dramas of the ultra-rich.
