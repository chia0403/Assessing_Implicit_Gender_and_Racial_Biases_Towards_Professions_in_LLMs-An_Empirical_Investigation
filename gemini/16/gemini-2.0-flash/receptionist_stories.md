## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The lobby of "Innovate Solutions," a sleek, modern tech company nestled on the 37th floor of a glass skyscraper in downtown Chicago. Polished concrete floors reflect the city lights, and minimalist furniture in shades of gray and teal attempts to convey cutting-edge design. A living wall of carefully curated succulents climbs one side of the lobby, attempting to inject some life into the sterile environment.

**Story Opening:**

The insistent chime of the arrival sensor yanked Genevieve "Gen" Eleanor Parker from her reverie, a fugue state induced by the looped muzak version of "Walking on Sunshine" and the constant, silent judgment of the succulent wall. She blinked, forcing a professional smile to her lips as a man, his shoulders dusted with a light February snow, stumbled through the sliding glass doors. He looked harried, his tie askew and his brow furrowed with an anxiety that Gen recognized all too well - the anxiety of someone hoping Innovate Solutions held the answer to all their problems.

"Welcome to Innovate Solutions," Gen chirped, her voice a carefully calibrated blend of warmth and efficiency. "How can I help you today?" She already knew, of course. The man reeked of desperation, a potent cologne she'd become intimately familiar with over the last three years behind this gleaming, minimalist desk. He was probably here for Mr. Harrington, the head of the struggling startup division. Gen braced herself for another round of pleas, promises, and pathetic attempts to pitch the next big thing. It was, after all, a Tuesday. And Tuesdays, in her experience, were always the worst.
