## Story Opening:

The hum of the ultrasonic scaler vibrated through Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth's gloved hand, a familiar tremor that usually soothed her. Today, however, it was a discordant buzz against the rising anxiety twisting in her stomach. Mrs. Henderson, usually a chatty and cheerful patient, was unnervingly quiet, her eyes wide and fixed on the swirling plaster cherub adorning the corner of the ceiling. Eleanor had tried making small talk, complimenting Mrs. Henderson's daughter's recent engagement, even commenting on the unusually lovely weather, but each attempt had been met with a strained, monosyllabic response. Something was definitely wrong.

“Just a little further, Mrs. Henderson," Eleanor said, forcing a bright smile. “Almost done with that pesky tartar.”

Mrs. Henderson flinched as the scaler touched another tooth. A small, almost imperceptible tremor ran through her frame. "Doctor," she finally croaked, her voice raspy and low, "Have you... have you been seeing anything unusual lately?"

Eleanor paused, the scaler hovering just above Mrs. Henderson's lower incisors. Unusual? This entire appointment was unusual. But she couldn't exactly voice that. "Unusual how, Mrs. Henderson?" she asked, her voice carefully neutral.

Mrs. Henderson swallowed hard, her eyes darting nervously around the room. "I... I don't know how to explain it. Just... things. Out of the corner of my eye. Shadowy figures. Whispers in the night..."

Eleanor frowned. This was definitely beyond the scope of a routine cleaning. She was a dentist, not a therapist... or, she thought with a sudden, chilling realization, maybe something else entirely was required in this town.

## Setting:

The setting is the quiet, coastal town of Port Blossom, Maine. Eleanor's dental practice, "Ainsworth Family Dentistry," is a charming Victorian house converted into a modern office, located on Main Street, nestled between a quaint bookstore and a bustling lobster shack. Inside, the waiting room is decorated with soothing blues and greens, nautical-themed artwork, and a comfortable, overstuffed armchair. Sunlight streams through the large windows, illuminating the gleaming white surfaces of the treatment rooms. Despite the cheerful decor and the typically relaxing atmosphere, the air often feels heavy with the salt-tinged air and a subtle, unspoken unease, a residue of the town's long and often turbulent history. The ocean, ever-present, is a constant reminder of both beauty and mystery, a mirror reflecting not only the sky but also the hidden depths of Port Blossom's secrets.
