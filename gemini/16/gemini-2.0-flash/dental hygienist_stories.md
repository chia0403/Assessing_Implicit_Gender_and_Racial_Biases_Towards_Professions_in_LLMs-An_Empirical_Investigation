The harsh fluorescent lights of Gentle Smiles Dental Clinic buzzed a monotonous hum, doing little to alleviate the pre-dawn gloom seeping in through the rain-streaked window. Inside, the air reeked of minty mouthwash and the faintly unsettling aroma of freshly polished enamel. It was a smell Beatrice Eleanor Cavendish had grown so accustomed to that she barely registered it anymore, much like the soul-crushing feeling of clocking in before the sun had even considered rising.

Beatrice, her auburn hair pulled back in a neat, if slightly weary, bun, meticulously wiped down the dental chair. She was a perfectionist, even at 6:30 AM. Each speck of potential bacteria had to be annihilated before the first patient of the day arrived, an anxious little boy named Timothy, who had a notoriously bad sweet tooth and a penchant for hiding candy in his bedroom.

Gentle Smiles was located in Harmony Creek, a seemingly idyllic suburb nestled on the edge of the Cascade Mountains in Washington State. The kind of place where everyone knew their neighbors, organized potlucks, and diligently flossed (or at least, *claimed* to). Harmony Creek was, in Beatriceâ€™s opinion, almost too perfect, a shimmering veneer hiding a multitude of secrets, both dental and otherwise. And Beatrice, armed with her scraper and her perpetually pleasant demeanor, was often privy to more of those secrets than she cared to be.
