## Story Opening & Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The scent of stale coffee and disinfectant hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Ms. Eleanor Beatrice Harding. She surveyed her domain - the Guidance Counselor's Office, a room perpetually teetering between chaotic and comforting. A half-eaten granola bar lay precariously on a stack of college brochures, threatening to rain crumbs upon the glossy faces of future Ivy Leaguers. Today, however, the usual quiet hum of paperwork and hushed anxieties was replaced by an unnerving silence. Even the perpetually humming fluorescent lights seemed to dim in anticipation. Eleanor hadn't heard the rumors, hadn't seen the frantic whispers swirling through the hallways. She was justâ€¦ waiting. Waiting for the inevitable storm that always followed a school lock-down drill.

**Setting:**

The story is set in **Northwood High School**, a sprawling, brick-built institution nestled on the outskirts of Willow Creek, a quiet, almost idyllic town in upstate New York. Northwood served a diverse student population, ranging from the children of wealthy doctors and lawyers to those from struggling working-class families. The school itself reflected this dichotomy: a state-of-the-art gymnasium and science labs contrasted starkly with crumbling lockers and perpetually leaking water fountains. Eleanor's office, though small and somewhat cramped, was her sanctuary. It was filled with motivational posters plastered slightly askew, a well-worn armchair that had witnessed countless teenage anxieties, and a desk overflowing with applications, student files, and the occasional stress ball shaped like an avocado. The room was a kaleidoscope of color and clutter, a testament to the many lives she touched within its walls.
