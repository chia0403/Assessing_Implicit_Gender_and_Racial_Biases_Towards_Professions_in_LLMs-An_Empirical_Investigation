The biting November wind, sharp enough to carve granite, whipped at Thomas Jefferson Riley's exposed ears, turning them the color of overripe plums. He’d been perched on the precarious peak of the Widow Hawthorne's Victorian mansion for nearly three hours, and the cold was beginning to seep past his thickest wool socks and into his very bones. The slate tiles, slick with a fine sheen of frost, were a treacherous ballet under his well-worn work boots.

The mansion itself stood on the highest point of Havenwood, Massachusetts, overlooking a tapestry of frosted fields and dormant orchards. Built in the late 1800s, it was a gothic monstrosity of turrets, gables, and stained-glass windows, all yearning skyward. Legends whispered of fortunes lost and loves gone sour within its walls, and Thomas, a practical man who usually dismissed such stories, couldn't help but feel a prickle of unease as he surveyed the sprawling, shadowy structure. The air hung thick with the smell of damp earth, decaying leaves, and something else… something subtly metallic, like old blood. He shivered, pulled his worn Carhartt jacket tighter, and reminded himself he was just here to fix a few loose tiles, not to solve any century-old mysteries. Still, the way the wind howled through the eaves sounded suspiciously like a whispered warning.
