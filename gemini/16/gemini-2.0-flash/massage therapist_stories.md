## Story Opening:

The first hint was the low thrum in her fingers, a subtle vibration that resonated with the tension knotted tight in Mrs. Hemlock's trapezius muscles.  Normally, Amelia Josephine Bell would dismiss it as the hum of the massage table motor, but there was no motor. This table was old, sturdy, and powered solely by Amelia's own two hands. The second hint was the faint scent of ozone, not quite electric, but undeniably *charged*, that mingled with the calming lavender oil she used. Amelia took a slow, deliberate breath, trying to center herself.  She had a full afternoon ahead, a waiting list that stretched a week deep, and no time for imagination.  But as she deepened her pressure, working a stubborn knot beneath Mrs. Hemlock's shoulder blade, the thrum escalated, and the lavender oil began to shimmer, reflecting not the soft spa lighting, but something brighter, wilder, and utterly impossible.

## Setting:

Amelia's Haven, a small, independent massage therapy studio tucked away in a converted Victorian house on Willow Creek Lane in the sleepy town of Havenwood, Connecticut.  The exterior boasted peeling paint the color of faded rose petals and a porch swing that creaked a melancholy tune with every gust of wind.  Inside, however, was a sanctuary of tranquility. Soft, natural light filtered through sheer linen curtains. The walls were painted a soothing seafoam green, adorned with framed prints of botanical illustrations.  A trickling fountain gurgled quietly in the corner, its gentle sound competing with the muted strains of instrumental music.  Three massage rooms radiated from a central waiting area, each meticulously decorated to evoke a sense of calm and well-being. The air was always thick with the comforting aromas of essential oils and beeswax candles, masking the underlying scent of dust and history that clung to the old house.  Amelia took pride in creating a space where her clients could truly escape and find respite from the everyday stresses of life, even if it was just for an hour. Little did she know, the escape they were about to experience might be a bit *too* effective.
