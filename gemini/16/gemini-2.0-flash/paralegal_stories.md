Eleanor felt a fierce protectiveness towards her, a desire to help that burned brighter than the caffeine jitters coursing through her veins. She meticulously scanned each page, searching for anything, *anything,* that could help them fight the eviction. This wasn't just a job for Eleanor; it was a crusade.
