The clatter of keyboards was a symphony of drudgery to Eleanor Beatrice Albright, a symphony she’d been conducting for precisely seven years, four months, and eleven days. The setting was the outer office of Peterson, Finch & Bartholomew, a law firm nestled on the twenty-seventh floor of the Bradbury Building in downtown Los Angeles. Light, diffused through stained-glass panels featuring scenes of biblical justice, cast an almost ecclesiastical glow on the faded grandeur of the mahogany desks and overflowing in-trays.

Eleanor sat at her station, a beige island in a sea of legal briefs and overflowing coffee mugs. Her fingers, usually nimble on the keyboard, tapped a restless rhythm on her desktop. It was almost lunchtime, and the aroma of stale coffee and printer toner hung heavy in the air, a noxious blend that promised headaches and unfulfilled dreams. Outside the large, grimy window, the smog hung like a permanent shroud, a dull reflection of the emotional fog that had settled over Eleanor’s own life. She longed for something more, something beyond the endless dictation, the relentless answering of phones, and the constant, quiet despair that permeated the air of Peterson, Finch & Bartholomew.
