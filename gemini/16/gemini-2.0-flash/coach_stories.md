**Setting:** A small, windswept town called Port Blossom, nestled on the rugged coast of Maine. The year is 1987, and the air smells perpetually of salt and pine. The town's primary landmark is the imposing, Victorian-era Port Blossom High School, its brick facade weathered by decades of harsh Atlantic storms. Inside, the gymnasium is a cavernous space, smelling of sweat, old wood, and the faint ghost of disinfectant. The basketball court, scarred with years of fierce competition, reflects the harsh fluorescent lights that hum overhead. Outside, the bleachers are mostly empty, save for the occasional seagull perched on the highest row, its sharp cry echoing across the playing field.

**Story Opening:**

The squeak of sneakers echoed in the otherwise silent gymnasium. Cordelia Anne "Cori" Bellweather, the head coach of the Port Blossom High School Seagulls girls' basketball team, dribbled a basketball with practiced ease, the rhythmic thump a counterpoint to the restless drumming of her fingers on the worn leather. Sweat trickled down her temples, pasting strands of her auburn hair to her forehead. She hadn't turned on the heat, preferring the bracing chill; it helped her think. Today, she needed to think clearly.

Tomorrow was the first day of tryouts.

And this year, more than ever, the pressure was immense. Last year's humiliating season, a dismal 3-17 record, had cast a long, dark shadow over her reputation. The whispers were getting louder, the glares from the town council more pointed. Another losing season, and Cori knew, she wouldn't just be losing games. She'd be losing her job.

She stopped dribbling, the ball held firmly in her hands. Gazing at the worn Seagulls logo painted at center court, a wave of doubt washed over her. Could she turn things around? Could she find the talent, the drive, the *something* that would breathe life back into this team, this town, this burning, gnawing feeling of failure inside her? She bounced the ball again, the sound sharp and resolute, a silent answer to her own questioning heart. She had to. For herself, for the girls, and for the hope – however fragile – that still flickered in Port Blossom.
