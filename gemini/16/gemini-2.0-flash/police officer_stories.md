Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a police officer named as requested:

**Setting:** The biting March wind whipped off Lake Michigan, stinging Detective Inspector Alistair Finley’s cheeks as he surveyed the scene. Chicago’s Navy Pier, usually a vibrant hive of tourists and street performers, lay eerily deserted. The normally cheerful carousel stood silent, a skeletal metal beast under the gloom of a perpetually overcast sky. Yellow police tape snaked around the entrance to the Chicago Shakespeare Theater, its bright color a jarring contrast to the somber mood hanging in the air. The rhythmic clang of a distant buoy bell was the only sound besides the hushed murmurs of the few officers present.

**Opening:** The smell hit Alistair before he even ducked under the yellow tape: stale popcorn, disinfectant, and something else... something metallic and sharp that clung to the back of his throat. He knew that smell. He’d smelled it too many times in his fifteen years on the force. Death. And not a peaceful, quiet death. This was…messy. He pulled his worn leather gloves tighter, the familiar texture a small comfort against the creeping dread that always accompanied a scene like this. Alistair took a deep breath, adjusted his tie, and stepped into the foyer of the theater. His job was to find out who had brought this particular brand of death to the heart of Chicago. His job was to make sure they wouldn't again.
