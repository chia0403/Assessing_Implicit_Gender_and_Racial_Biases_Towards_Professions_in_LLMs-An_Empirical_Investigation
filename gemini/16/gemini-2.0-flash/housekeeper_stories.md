## Opening:

The scent of burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a cloying counterpoint to the crisp, starched scent of cleaning solutions that Emmeline Abigail Finch had been painstakingly spraying all morning. Emmeline wrinkled her nose, peering into the depths of the imposing Aga cooker in the sprawling farmhouse kitchen. It seemed Mrs. Hemlock, notorious for her attempts at experimental baking, had struck again. This time, it appeared to be a candied ginger abomination that had been left to fester overnight.

Emmeline sighed, running a gloved hand through her already escaping bun. This was not in her cleaning schedule, a schedule she adhered to with the rigidity of a military commander. But then again, nothing at Hemlock Grange ever went according to plan.

## Setting:

Hemlock Grange, a sprawling, asymmetrical farmhouse nestled deep in the Cotswolds, was a monument to generations of questionable taste and inherited wealth. Built from honey-colored stone and adorned with rambling wisteria and a disconcerting number of gargoyles, the house seemed to simultaneously blend into and clash with the surrounding idyllic landscape. Inside, the decor was a chaotic jumble of antique furniture, garish modern art (presumably purchased on a whim), and enough dusty taxidermied animals to populate a small museum.

The Hemlock family, equally chaotic, consisted of the eccentric matriarch, Mrs. Beatrice Hemlock, a woman who alternated between writing avant-garde poetry and neglecting her duties as a landowner, and her two equally odd children: the brooding, artistic Julian, and the flighty, social media obsessed Chloe. Emmeline, meticulous and practical, was a constant source of bemusement and occasional irritation to them, a steady anchor in their sea of whimsy. She, in turn, found their eccentricities both endlessly fascinating and profoundly exhausting. Hemlock Grange was, in a word, a peculiar place. And Emmeline Abigail Finch, housekeeper extraordinaire, was the unlikely guardian of its sanity.
