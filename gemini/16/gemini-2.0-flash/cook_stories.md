The clatter of pans was a chaotic symphony, a familiar comfort to Abigail Rose Thatcher. Steam billowed around her face, momentarily blurring the already faded floral wallpaper of the tiny kitchen. It was six in the morning in Port Blossom, Maine, and the air, thick with the briny tang of the Atlantic, was slowly creeping through the cracks in the ill-fitting windowpane.

Abigail, a woman whose body had long since settled into the comfortable roundness of a well-fed apple pie, didnâ€™t mind the early hour. In fact, she relished it. The bakery, "Thatcher's Sweet Surrender," was her sanctuary, her legacy, and the only place she truly felt in control. 

Outside, the sleepy town was just beginning to stir. Fishermen would soon be heading out, their gruff voices carrying on the wind. Mrs. Higgins, from across the street, would be watering her prize-winning petunias, and the old church bell would chime, a reminder that another day was dawning. But inside, amidst the flour dust and the warming ovens, Abigail Rose Thatcher was already conjuring up the sweetness that would bring a little joy to Port Blossom.
