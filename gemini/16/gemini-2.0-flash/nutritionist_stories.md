**Setting:**

The air in "The Good Gut Bistro," a bustling lunch spot nestled in the heart of Portland, Oregon's quirky Hawthorne District, was thick with the comforting aroma of roasted vegetables, fermented ginger, and the quiet hum of conversation. Sunlight streamed through the large, reclaimed-wood framed windows, illuminating chalkboards boasting organic, locally-sourced ingredients. Mismatched vintage chairs surrounded tables crafted from repurposed bowling alley lanes, giving the place a relaxed, eco-chic vibe that perfectly embodied the Portland spirit. Outside, the rain, a constant companion this time of year, drizzled softly, creating a cozy contrast to the lively energy inside.

**Story Opening:**

Eleanor Rose Albright, RDN, LD, stood precariously balanced on a wobbly step stool, wrestling with a string of fairy lights that refused to cooperate. A strand of auburn hair, escaping from her messy bun, tickled her nose, making her sneeze. "Blast these stubborn littleâ€¦." she muttered under her breath, then sighed, pushing the hair back with a flour-dusted hand. Eleanor, in her late twenties, was the kind of woman who exuded warmth and competence, even when she was battling faulty wiring. She wore her passion for healthy eating like a badge of honor, a passion that had driven her to open "The Good Gut Bistro" just six months ago.

The lunch rush was about to begin, and she needed to finish decorating the window display, a carefully curated tableau of vibrant fruits and vegetables meant to entice the health-conscious (and the plain curious) inside. It was meant to scream "Good for you!" but right now, with the tangled lights and her mounting frustration, it was screaming "Electrician needed!"
