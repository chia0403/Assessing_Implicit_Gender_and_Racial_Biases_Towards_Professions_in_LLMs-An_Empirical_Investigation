The air in "Glamour & Grace" always smelled of success, a heady cocktail of bergamot from the expensive hand soap, the sweet ammonia of perm solution, and a faint, lingering cloud of glitter hairspray. For Grace Abigail Sterling, it was the scent of home, even more so than her small apartment above the bakery three blocks over. It was a Friday, late in the afternoon, and the salon was buzzing like a well-maintained beehive. Manicured fingers tapped impatiently on glossy magazines, snippets of conversations about vacation plans and dinner reservations filled the air, and the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of scissors created a percussive soundtrack to the impending weekend. Grace, her own platinum blonde hair pulled back in a sleek ponytail and her impeccably applied makeup hinting at the artist underneath the businesswoman, carefully painted a shimmering, emerald green onto Mrs. Van Derlyn's already flawless nails. Outside, a late October wind rattled the oversized plate-glass window, scattering fallen maple leaves across the cobblestone street of Willow Creek, a picturesque, postcard-perfect town nestled in the foothills of the Appalachians. The bell above the door jingled, announcing a new arrival, and Grace, ever the professional, offered a dazzling smile without even looking up. "Just a moment, dear," she said, her voice smooth and practiced. "I'll be right with you." Little did Grace know, that chime was more than just another appointment arriving. It was the herald of chaos.
