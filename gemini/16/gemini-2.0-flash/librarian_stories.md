The fluorescent lights of the Brattleboro Public Library hummed a monotonous counterpoint to the gentle rustling of pages and the hushed whispers that permeated the air. Eleanor Abigail Harding, Head Librarian and curator of forgotten ephemera, adjusted her spectacles and sighed, a wisp of air that disturbed the fine layer of dust clinging to the top of the ancient oak card catalog. The library, a venerable Victorian structure with soaring ceilings and an almost palpable sense of history, was her domain, her sanctuary, and, if she were honest, her greatest comfort. Outside, Brattleboro, Vermont was slowly succumbing to the crisp bite of autumn, the vibrant hues of the turning leaves painting the landscape in shades of fiery orange and burnt sienna. But inside the library, the colors were muted, the air thick with the scent of aged paper and beeswax polish, a world preserved, insulated from the vagaries of the seasons and the dramas of the outside world. It was, Eleanor thought, a perfect place for a quiet life. A thought she was about to drastically reconsider.
