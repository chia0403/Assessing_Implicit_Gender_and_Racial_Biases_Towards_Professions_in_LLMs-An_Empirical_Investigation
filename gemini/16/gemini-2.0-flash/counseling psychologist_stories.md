Okay, here's a story opening and setting:

**Setting:** A cozy, slightly cluttered office in a converted Victorian house in the heart of Beacon Hill, Boston. The walls are painted a calming sage green, lined with bookshelves overflowing with texts on psychology, philosophy, and even a few well-worn novels. Sunlight streams through the large bay window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and casting warm shadows on the plush, patterned rug. A faint scent of lavender and old paper hangs in the air, a comforting aroma designed to put clients at ease.

**Opening:**

The insistent chirping of the kettle finally cut through the cacophony in Dr. Eleanor Beatrice Ainsworth's mind. She pushed back from her desk, the worn leather creaking beneath her, and stretched, feeling the knots in her shoulders protest with a dull ache. It was almost six, and her last client of the day had just left, leaving behind a heavy atmosphere thick with unspoken grief and the lingering scent of cheap cigarettes.

Eleanor sighed, running a hand through her perpetually untidy auburn hair. She needed the tea. Badly. Another grueling session, another soul pouring its darkness into her carefully constructed sanctuary. Sometimes, she felt like a human sponge, absorbing all the pain until she was wrung dry.

As she waited for the water to boil, she glanced at the photograph on her desk: a faded image of her and her younger sister, Lily, laughing on a windswept beach. Lily, who understood her better than anyone. Lily, who had been gone for far too long.

The kettle shrieked, jarring her back to the present. Eleanor forced a smile. Time to make some tea, and thenâ€¦ maybe a strong glass of red wine. And try, just for a little while, to forget that the weight of the world rested, at least partially, on her shoulders. But even as she reached for the teapot, a nagging feeling, a prickle of unease, settled in the pit of her stomach. Something felt different tonight. The silence in the old house was too profound, the shadows in the corners too deep. And a sense of foreboding whispered a warning: this wasn't just another ordinary evening.
