## Story Opening:

The scent of lavender and deep heat wafted through the air, a familiar comfort to Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Blake. Outside, the relentless Seattle rain drummed against the large picture window of her clinic, blurring the vibrant green of the ferns lining the walk. Inside, however, the atmosphere was one of quiet competence and controlled relaxation.

Ellie ran a hand through her short, dark hair, the faint lines around her eyes deepening as she focused on the X-ray mounted on the illuminated view box. A sharp, almost imperceptible crack in the C5 vertebra stared back at her. Definitely not textbook. 

She sighed, a puff of air that momentarily fogged the glass of her reading glasses. This case was tricky, even for her. And just her luck, it belonged to the city's most notoriously difficult client, a woman whose high-powered lifestyle and equally high-strung personality were already radiating from the waiting room.

Ellie straightened, squared her shoulders, and took another deep breath. Time to face the music. After all, relieving suffering was what she did best.
## Setting:

**Dr. Eleanor Blake's Chiropractic Clinic, "Spine Align," in the Fremont neighborhood of Seattle, Washington.**

*   **Exterior:** A renovated, two-story Victorian house painted a calming shade of sage green. Lush, native plants soften the edges of the walkway, a welcome sight even in the perpetually damp climate. A discreet, hand-painted sign reading "Spine Align - Chiropractic & Wellness" hangs beside the front door.

*   **Interior:** Warm and inviting, with hardwood floors, exposed brick accents, and comfortable, modern furniture. The waiting room is a haven of tranquility, with soft lighting, calming artwork depicting Pacific Northwest landscapes, and a small library of health and wellness books. The treatment rooms are clean and functional, equipped with state-of-the-art chiropractic tables and diagnostic equipment, but also maintain a sense of warmth and comfort with soft blankets and soothing music.
