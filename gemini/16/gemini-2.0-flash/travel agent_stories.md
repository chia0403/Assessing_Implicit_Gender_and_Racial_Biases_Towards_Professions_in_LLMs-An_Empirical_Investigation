## Story Opening:

The aroma of stale coffee mingled with the faintest hint of coconut sunscreen, a scent Penelope "Penny" Ainsworth found both comforting and mildly depressing. Comforting because it was the smell of her sanctuary, the place where dreams were packaged and sold, and depressing because, frankly, Penny hadn’t seen an actual beach in almost two years. The fluorescent lights of "Ainsworth Adventures," nestled between a bustling bakery and a perpetually-under-construction nail salon on Maple Street, hummed their monotonous tune, a soundtrack to her own stagnant existence.

Mrs. Higgins, perched on the edge of the faux-leather client chair, cleared her throat, her voice a low rumble. "So, Ms. Ainsworth, as I was saying…"

Penny forced a smile, the crinkles around her eyes deepening despite her best efforts to smooth them out with a fingertip. "Yes, Mrs. Higgins. The all-inclusive package to the Bavarian Alps. We were discussing the yodeling lessons. Optional, of course, but highly recommended for an authentic experience."

Mrs. Higgins’s eyes narrowed, reflecting the harsh overhead lighting. “Authentic? Dear me, I just want somewhere with guaranteed sunshine and unlimited shrimp cocktails. And perhaps a handsome young ski instructor."

Penny sighed internally. Another day, another escape fantasy projected onto her. She plastered on her most professional smile and reached for the glossy brochure depicting a snow-capped mountain range bathed in golden light. "Well, Mrs. Higgins, let's see if we can find you exactly what you're looking for..."

## Setting:

**Ainsworth Adventures, a travel agency located at 12 Maple Street in the small, unassuming town of Oakhaven, Connecticut.**

The agency itself is a small, slightly cramped space. A single large window displays posters of exotic destinations, their colors faded from the sun. Inside, the walls are painted a calming, though slightly outdated, shade of teal. Three desks, each cluttered with brochures, maps, and travel magazines, are arranged haphazardly. Penny’s desk, closest to the window, is distinguishable by the small succulent plant stubbornly surviving in a chipped teacup and the overflowing in-tray threatening to avalanche onto the floor. A world map hangs above the desks, covered in brightly colored pushpins indicating destinations booked by Penny and her two (equally disillusioned) colleagues, Mildred and Bob. The overall atmosphere is one of well-intentioned enthusiasm struggling against the relentless tide of paperwork and the persistent ache of unrealized travel dreams.
