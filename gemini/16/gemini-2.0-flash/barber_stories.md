The scent of bay rum and burnt coffee hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume that Ebenezer "Eb" Silas had breathed in for the better part of sixty years. Sunlight, fractured by the grime-streaked window of "Eb's Shearing Station," painted dusty stripes across the checkerboard linoleum floor. Outside, the sleepy town of Dust Devil, Arizona, simmered in the midday heat. A tumbleweed, more stubborn than most of Ebenezer's customers, stubbornly clung to the hitching post outside the saloon across the street.

Eb, his gnarled hands trembling slightly, sharpened his straight razor against a well-worn leather strop. The rhythmic *schtick-schtick-schtick* was a comforting sound in the otherwise silent shop. The bell above the door hadn’t jingled since old Mrs. Henderson came in for a “trim” last Tuesday (mostly just Eb snipping off a stray eyebrow hair). Dust Devil wasn't exactly booming these days. The mine had dried up, the cattle were scrawny, and most of the younger generation had packed their bags for Phoenix, leaving Eb and his dwindling clientele to stew in the slow cooker of the desert. He sighed, a sound like air leaking from a punctured tire. At 78 years old, Ebenezer Silas had seen a lot of sunsets rise and fall over Dust Devil, and he had a sinking feeling this one might be his last in business.
