The late afternoon sun bled crimson through the towering glass facade of the Millennium Tower in downtown Chicago. The air inside the trading floor hummed with a frantic energy, a palpable tension that vibrated off the banks of monitors displaying cascading numbers and cryptic financial jargon.

A single, devastating tweet from an anonymous source had triggered a panic sell-off, and Alexander James Thornton was staring down the barrel of a career-ending loss. He just needed to figure out who, or what, was behind it all. And fast.
