## Story Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

The static crackled, a familiar lullaby to Leo Maxwell's ears. He chewed on the end of his pen, squinting at the schematic diagram splayed across his cluttered workbench. This particular hum, a high-pitched whine that threatened to shatter glass, had been plaguing the signal of WBRK, the oldest radio station in Briarwood, for the past three weeks. Leo had tried everything: re-soldering connections, swapping out tubes older than himself, even applying a generous dose of WD-40 where logic dictated it shouldn’t go. Nothing worked. The whine persisted, a ghostly echo in the otherwise clear broadcast, driving him and the station manager, Mrs. Higgins, slowly mad. Today, however, felt different. The whine was… sharper. More defined. Almost… deliberate. Leo felt a prickle of unease crawl up his spine. This wasn’t a simple equipment malfunction anymore. This was something else.

**Setting:**

The story is set in the dusty, slightly dilapidated attic of WBRK, a radio station nestled in the small, sleepy town of Briarwood, Massachusetts in the year 1978. The attic, accessible only by a narrow, creaking staircase, is Leo Maxwell's domain. It's a chaotic haven filled with the detritus of decades of broadcasting history: stacks of outdated vinyl records, tangled wires spilling from boxes overflowing with spare parts, antique microphones gathering dust, and the pungent aroma of burnt solder and vacuum tubes. Sunlight filters weakly through a single grimy window, illuminating the motes dancing in the air and highlighting the aged, peeling paint. The air is thick with the hum of machinery, a constant low thrum that vibrates through the floorboards and up into Leo’s bones. Below, the station’s broadcast is a constant, muffled presence, a reminder of the audience relying on Leo to keep their news, music, and local gossip flowing. Despite the disarray, the attic holds a certain charm, a testament to the ingenuity and resourcefulness of the men and women who kept WBRK on the air for so many years. It's a place where technology and history intertwine, a fitting stage for the strange events that are about to unfold.
