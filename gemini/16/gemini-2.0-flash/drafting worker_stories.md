Okay, here's a story opening and setting centered around a drafting worker:

**Setting:**

The year is 1957. The place is the sprawling, dimly lit drafting room of the "Everett & Sons Ironworks" in the grimy, industrial heart of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Rows upon rows of identical drafting tables stretch across the room, each illuminated by a gooseneck lamp that cast a small circle of focused light, isolating each draftsman in their own little island of concentration. The air is thick with the smell of India ink, tracing paper, and the ever-present, vaguely metallic tang of the nearby steel mills. A low hum pervades the room - the collective sound of T-squares sliding, pencils scratching, and the occasional muffled cough. Outside, the clatter of streetcars and the roar of the furnaces provide a constant backdrop to the meticulous work being done within. The walls are adorned with blueprints yellowed with age, charts detailing various iron and steel specifications, and a large, motivational poster featuring a robust, smiling steelworker wielding a sledgehammer.

**Story Opening:**

"Damn it all to hell," sputtered Arthur Reginald Pendelton III, his voice barely a whisper above the general hum of the drafting room. He stared down at the blueprint before him, his brow furrowed in concentration that verged on pain.  A tiny, almost imperceptible error in the angle of a support beam had somehow managed to elude him for the better part of the morning. Now, as the lunch bell threatened to shatter the tenuous calm, it glared back at him like a taunt. Arthur, a man whose meticulously parted hair and perpetually stained vest suggested a life lived in the service of precision, felt a flush creep up his neck. He reached for his eraser, a small, battered piece of rubber that had witnessed countless similar acts of self-inflicted torment. Today, however, it felt inadequate. Arthur knew that Mr. Abernathy, the Chief Draftsman, would have his hide if this blueprint went out with such a glaring mistake. And Arthur Reginald Pendelton III, despite his grand name, was not a man built for confrontation.
