**Story Opening:**

The biting Icelandic wind clawed at Amelia Ingrid Bjornstad’s face, whipping strands of her salt-and-pepper hair across her vision. She didn't bother brushing them away. The discomfort was… invigorating. Just like the raw, unforgiving landscape that stretched before her, a tapestry of black sand beaches and jagged, snow-capped peaks. This was it. The heart of her film. The heart of her story.

She exhaled, a plume of white vapor momentarily obscuring the view, and gripped the worn leather case containing her grandfather’s old Leitz Leica M3. This camera, more than any script, was her talisman. It had captured the ghost stories of her childhood summers in Norway, the gritty realism of her early documentaries, and the ethereal beauty of her last, award-winning feature. Now, it would capture this – the desolate beauty of Iceland, the backdrop for her most ambitious project yet: a modern retelling of the Norse saga of Freya and Odin.

Amelia closed her eyes for a beat, allowing the wind to buffet her, feeling the icy spray of the waves crashing against the black volcanic rocks. The sounds, the smells, the sheer visceral intensity of the place filled her lungs, cleared her head. This was what she needed. After years of battling studio executives and compromising her artistic vision, she was finally back in control. This was her canvas. And she was ready to paint.

**Setting:**

The story opens in the desolate Vik i Myrdal region of southern Iceland. The specific location is a black sand beach overlooked by the towering Reynisfjall mountain and the Reynisdrangar sea stacks, jagged basalt columns rising dramatically from the churning ocean. It's late autumn, just before the onset of full winter. The days are short and the light is often diffused and ethereal, creating a haunting and dramatic atmosphere. The constant wind and the sound of the waves contribute to a sense of isolation and vulnerability. Small wooden farmhouses, painted in traditional Icelandic colours, dot the sparse landscape, hinting at the resilience of life in this harsh environment.
