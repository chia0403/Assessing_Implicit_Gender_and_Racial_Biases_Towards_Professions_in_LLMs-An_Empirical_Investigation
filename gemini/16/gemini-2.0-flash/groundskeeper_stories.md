## Story Opening:

The morning mist clung to the dew-laden grass like a lovesick ghost. Its damp fingers curled around the stone cherubs perched on the western edge of the rose garden, obscuring their cherubic faces in a pearly haze. Inside the glass-domed conservatory, the air was thick and humid, a stark contrast to the crisp autumn chill seeping into the grounds outside. Inside, amongst the orchids and the carnivorous pitcher plants, **Barnaby Finch**, Head Groundskeeper, was already hard at work.

He hummed a tuneless melody as he meticulously pruned a stubborn tendril creeping from a sprawling bougainvillea. His large, calloused hands, usually rough from raking leaves and shoveling snow, moved with surprising delicacy. He knew each plant intimately, understood its particular needs, its quirks, its silent pleas. He considered them his silent companions, a stark contrast to the often-haughty clientele he catered to.

A distant, high-pitched shriek echoed from the main house, barely audible above the hiss of the automatic watering system. Barnaby straightened, a flicker of annoyance crossing his usually placid face. Another crisis, no doubt. The shrill cry of a demanding debutante or the temper tantrum of a pampered poodle, judging by the pitch. He sighed, wiped the sweat from his brow with the back of his hand, and resigned himself to another interruption. He only hoped it wouldnâ€™t involve rescuing a Siamese cat from the reflecting pool, a task he'd performed, with increasing irritation, three times in the last month alone.

## Setting:

The story is set on the sprawling estate of **Ashton Manor**, a Gothic revival mansion situated on a windswept bluff overlooking the dramatic coastline of Maine. The manor has been in the Ashton family for generations and is now run as a luxury retreat, catering to the wealthy and often eccentric clientele. The grounds are extensive and meticulously maintained, encompassing formal gardens, sprawling lawns, a dense forest, and even a private beach accessible by a winding cliffside path. The conservatory, a Victorian-era glass structure, is Barnaby's domain, a place of refuge and quiet contemplation amidst the often chaotic atmosphere of the estate. The overall atmosphere is one of faded grandeur and underlying secrets, a juxtaposition of opulent beauty and the creeping decay that comes with age and neglect.
