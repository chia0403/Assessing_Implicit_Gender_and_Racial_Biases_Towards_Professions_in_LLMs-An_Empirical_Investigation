The stale smell of cigarette smoke and cheap whiskey clung to the threadbare armchair like a persistent ghost. Rain hammered against the grimy window of the office, mirroring the relentless beat of doubt in Jasper Malloryâ€™s chest. He ran a hand through his already disheveled hair, the movement doing little to alleviate the knot tightening behind his eyes. The chipped, ceramic ashtray on his desk overflowed, a testament to the long, sleepless nights that had become his unwelcome companion.

The setting was late November in Chicago. Jasper Mallory, a private detective with a penchant for trouble and a nose for things others missed, ran Mallory Investigations out of a cramped, second-floor walk-up above a fading Polish bakery on Division Street. The walls, painted a sickly green, were adorned with framed (but faded) certificates, a calendar permanently stuck on June 1987, and a dog-eared map of the city, crisscrossed with red pen markings like battle lines in a silent war. The furniture, a motley collection salvaged from flea markets and deceased estates, spoke of a business struggling to stay afloat, much like the detective himself. Chicago was a city of secrets, whispering in the alleys and gleaming from the polished skyscrapers, and Jasper Mallory was determined to listen. But tonight, the only thing whispering was the wind, carrying with it the promise of a bitter winter and the distinct possibility of a closed sign on Mallory Investigations before Christmas.
