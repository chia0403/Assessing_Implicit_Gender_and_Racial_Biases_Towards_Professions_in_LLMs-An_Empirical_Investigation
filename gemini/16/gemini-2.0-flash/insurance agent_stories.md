The beige stucco of Unit 32, Lakeside Condominiums, was a particularly offensive shade of beige. It clashed horribly with the robin’s egg blue door, and frankly, irritated everything about Archibald Finch. Not that he’d ever voice his complaints to Mrs. Higgins, the resident busybody and Unit 32’s owner. He needed her signature on the updated flood insurance paperwork, and a man didn’t bite the hand that held the pen, even if that hand happened to be attached to a woman with questionable taste in home décor.

It was a humid July afternoon in the sleepy town of Harmony Creek, Ohio. Harmony Creek, ironically, was anything but harmonious when you considered the annual pie-baking contest that usually devolved into passive-aggressive sabotage and whispered accusations of stolen rhubarb recipes. Archibald loved Harmony Creek, though. It was predictable, comfortable, and full of people desperately in need of his services as an insurance agent with Harmony Mutual Insurance.

Archibald Finch smoothed the lapels of his slightly-too-tight navy blazer, adjusted his tie (striped, of course, a classic choice in his opinion), and took a deep breath. He hated door-to-door. He preferred the sanctuary of his office, a haven of laminated pamphlets, ergonomic chairs, and the comforting hum of the fax machine. But Mrs. Higgins was elderly and stubbornly refused to operate a computer. So, here he was, facing the offending beige stucco, prepared to brave the storm of floral wallpaper and cat hair that awaited him inside. This was the life of Archibald Finch, insurance agent extraordinaire, and sometimes, door-to-door martyr.
