The pre-dawn air hung thick and heavy, a damp blanket clinging to the world as the first tendrils of orange began to claw their way over the jagged peaks of the Cascade Mountains. Fog, the color of bruised plums, swirled around the highway, obscuring the painted lines and swallowing the pine trees whole. This was Highway 20, Washington State, at its most treacherous.

The only sign of life besides the persistent hum of the pre-dawn breeze was the flickering amber beacon atop a weathered pickup truck parked on the shoulder. Inside, Evelyn Beatrice Hawthorne sipped lukewarm coffee from a thermos, the stale taste doing little to cut through the lingering exhaustion. Evelyn, or “Ev” as everyone on her crew called her, was a highway worker, and Highway 20 was her domain. She knew every bend, every pothole, every treacherous patch of black ice like the back of her calloused hand.

This morning, they were patching a particularly nasty section of asphalt just east of Concrete, where a winter of relentless freeze-thaw cycles had turned the road into a lunar landscape. Ev ran a gloved hand over the worn fabric of her fluorescent safety vest, the reflective stripes dull with grime and countless washes. The radio crackled to life, a garbled voice cutting through the pre-dawn quiet. It was Tony, the foreman, checking in. "Ev, you out there already? Fog's a killer this morning. Be careful out there, alright?"

"Copy that, Tony," Ev replied, her voice raspy. "Just waiting on the sun to burn this stuff off. And, you know, the rest of the crew." She glanced at the rearview mirror, at the shadows dancing in the fog. This was going to be a long day.
