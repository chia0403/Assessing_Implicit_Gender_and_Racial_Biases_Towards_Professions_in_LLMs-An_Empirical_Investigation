## Story Opening:

The biting wind whipped off Lake Superior, stinging Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Vance's exposed cheeks as she wrestled with the recalcitrant latch on her Jeep's gate. The late October sun, a weak and watery disc behind a scrim of grey clouds, offered little comfort. Ellie finally managed to pry the gate open, the rusted metal screaming in protest like a tortured animal. Sighing, she pulled out the worn leather satchel overflowing with medical supplies, its contents rattling like a restless spirit. Another call, another crisis, another hour swallowed by the vast, unforgiving landscape of Isle Royale. Tonight, it was a possible case of pneumonia at Tobin Harbor, a good forty-minute drive on roads that were barely more than rutted tracks. Ellie knew the ferry wasn't running this late, meaning a cold, choppy trip in her unreliable motorboat.

## Setting:

The story opens on **Isle Royale National Park, Michigan, in late October.** Isle Royale is a remote island in Lake Superior, accessible only by boat or seaplane. It's known for its rugged wilderness, including forests, lakes, swamps, and rocky shorelines. The human population is sparse, consisting mainly of park rangers and a handful of year-round residents scattered across the island in small, isolated communities like Tobin Harbor and Rock Harbor. The autumn season brings a stark beauty to the island, with vibrant foliage battling against the encroaching threat of winter. The weather is unpredictable, often harsh, and the isolation can be both a sanctuary and a source of profound loneliness.
