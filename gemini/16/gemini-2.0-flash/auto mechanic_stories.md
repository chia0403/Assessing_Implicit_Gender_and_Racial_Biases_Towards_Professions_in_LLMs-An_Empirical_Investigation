The oppressive Georgia heat was already shimmering off the asphalt of the lot at Benny's Auto Repair by 7:00 AM, promising another scorcher. Sweat prickled the back of Rosalind "Rosie" Bellweather's neck as she wrestled open the bay door, the rusty hinges groaning in protest. The smell of oil, gasoline, and slightly singed brake pads – a symphony familiar and comforting – washed over her. Rosie, a woman built like a toolbox and just as sturdy, wiped her forehead with the back of a grease-stained hand and surveyed her domain.

Benny’s wasn’t pretty. It was a single, cinderblock building nestled between a dilapidated laundromat and a perpetually vacant used car lot, the kind of place where stray cats felt comfortable enough to nap on abandoned tires. Inside, the concrete floor was a patchwork of oil stains and embedded grime. Tools hung haphazardly from a pegboard, a testament to Benny’s organized chaos (before he retired and left it to her, of course). A calendar featuring a vintage pin-up girl, her engine practically exposed, hung crookedly above Rosie’s cluttered desk.

But Benny's was home. It was where she’d learned to wield a wrench, to diagnose a sputtering engine with just an ear, and to argue with stubborn lug nuts until they surrendered. And now, it was hers to run, to nurture, and to keep alive in a town increasingly obsessed with sleek, computerized imports that Rosie didn't quite trust. This morning, a beat-up Ford pickup was already waiting, its driver likely already complaining about "that damn rattle." Rosie sighed, a small smile tugging at the corner of her lips. Another day, another challenge, another chance to prove that Rosalind Bellweather, auto mechanic extraordinaire, could fix just about anything.
