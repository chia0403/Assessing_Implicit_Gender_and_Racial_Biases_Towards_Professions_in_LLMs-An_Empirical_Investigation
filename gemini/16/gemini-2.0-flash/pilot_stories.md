## Opening:

The shrill whine of the turboprops, usually a comforting lullaby, felt like a jagged edge scraping against Amelia Quinn's skull this morning. She hadn't slept. The coffee, bitter and strong enough to strip paint, did little to dispel the bone-deep weariness that had settled over her like a shroud. She ran a calloused thumb along the worn leather grip of the control stick, the familiar texture offering a small, fleeting solace. Below, the tapestry of the Amazon sprawled, a vast and emerald wilderness that swallowed secrets whole. Secrets like the one she carried in her heart, the one that fueled her reason for being here.

## Setting:

The scene is set in the cockpit of a vintage de Havilland DHC-2 Beaver, a single-engine, high-wing, propeller-driven short takeoff and landing (STOL) aircraft. The interior is cramped and functional, smelling of oil, dust, and that indefinable, musty scent of age and hard work. Gauges are scattered across the dashboard, many showing their wear, but each painstakingly maintained by Amelia. A well-worn map of the Amazon basin is spread across the co-pilot's seat, its edges frayed and marked with grease pencil notes. Sunlight streams through the windshield, illuminating the swirling dust motes dancing in the air, a stark reminder of the unforgiving conditions of the jungle. Outside, the endless expanse of the Amazon rainforest stretches in all directions, a dense, seemingly impenetrable sea of green punctuated by the silver ribbons of meandering rivers. Small, isolated indigenous communities, barely visible from above, dot the landscape like tiny, forgotten jewels.
