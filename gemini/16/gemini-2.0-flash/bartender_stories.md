The stale, amber-tinged air of The Serpent's Coil hung thick and heavy, a suffocating blanket woven from spilled beer, regret, and the lingering ghost of a thousand forgotten songs. Rain hammered against the warped plywood that served as one of the bar’s walls, a relentless percussion that seemed to mock the lethargic rhythm of the ceiling fan struggling overhead. A lone neon sign above the back bar, its 'S' flickering erratically, cast elongated, dancing shadows on the dusty bottles of cheap whiskey and rum.

Behind that bar, wiping down a seemingly spotless surface with a perpetually damp rag, stood **Rosalind "Rosie" Bellweather**. Her dark hair, pulled back in a severe bun, was starting to loosen around her temples, escaping in wisps that mirrored the restless energy she usually managed to keep tightly contained. Her perpetually tired eyes, the color of aged pewter, scanned the almost empty room. Only a handful of regulars occupied their usual spots - old Man Hemlock nursing a lukewarm beer at the end, a pair of grizzled dockworkers arguing over a game of checkers in a dimly lit corner, and the perpetually lonely Mrs. Henderson staring wistfully into a glass of watery gin and tonic at a table near the back.

The Serpent's Coil wasn't much to look at. It wasn’t even on the map, technically. Nestled between a decaying bait shop and a rusted-out crab shack on the fringes of Port Azure, a forgotten fishing town clinging precariously to the rugged coastline of Oregon, it was a place where secrets festered and memories drowned. A place where Rosie Bellweather had unwittingly found herself both trapped and, strangely, at home.
