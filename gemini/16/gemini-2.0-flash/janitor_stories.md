The flickering fluorescent lights of the Institute of Extraterrestrial Linguistics hummed a lonely tune as Ezekiel "Zeke" Pritchard dragged his mop bucket down the hallway. It was 3:17 AM, and the silence of the building pressed in on him, thick and heavy as the stale coffee aroma lingering from yesterday’s symposium on "Comparative Galactic Dialects." The Institute itself was a sprawling, brutalist structure of reinforced concrete and tinted glass, nestled incongruously on the edge of a sprawling cornfield just outside of Ames, Iowa. Inside, however, it held wonders and anxieties in equal measure: dusty, leather-bound tomes detailing the history of attempted human-alien communication, holographic projections of swirling nebula, and unsettling recordings of sounds that defied earthly explanation. Zeke, of course, mostly saw the discarded coffee cups, the crumbs of forgotten danishes, and the scuff marks left by nervous academics pacing the corridors, chasing the elusive whisper of an alien tongue. Tonight, however, the silence felt different, more pregnant, like a held breath waiting for something…or someone… to exhale.
