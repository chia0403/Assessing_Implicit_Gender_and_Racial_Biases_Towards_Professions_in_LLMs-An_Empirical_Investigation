**Opening:**

The rhythmic whir of the overhead projector was the only sound competing with the frantic drumming of Clara Beatrice Mallory’s fingers against her meticulously organized planner. Three minutes. Three minutes until she had to present her innovative sensory integration therapy techniques to the regional pediatric conference. Three minutes until she either convinced her peers that her approach was a legitimate breakthrough, or cemented her reputation as the resident “glitter-glue-and-good-vibes” therapist. Clara took a deep breath, the sterile air of the conference room doing little to calm the butterflies that had taken residence in her stomach. She’d poured everything into this presentation, years of research, countless hours with her young patients, and an embarrassing amount of late nights fueled by lukewarm coffee and sheer determination. Now, it was time to either sink or swim.

**Setting:**

The conference room, christened the “Synergy Suite” with a predictably optimistic flourish, was located in the sprawling Phoenix Convention Center. A maze of beige carpets, generic artwork depicting smiling families, and the constant hum of HVAC systems, the center epitomized corporate sterility. The room itself was a testament to functional, if uninspired, design. Rows of padded chairs faced a large projection screen, the cool blue light reflecting off the polished linoleum floor. At the front, a solitary podium stood sentinel, its surface littered with hastily discarded conference pamphlets and half-empty water bottles. Beyond the floor-to-ceiling windows, the relentless Arizona sun beat down on the cityscape, a stark contrast to the artificially cooled environment within. This year's conference theme, emblazoned on every banner and name tag, was "Bridging Gaps: Innovation in Pediatric Therapy." Clara just hoped her presentation lived up to the hype.
