## Story Opening:

The rhythmic *thwack* of Cleaver’s butcher knife was the only sound louder than the buzzing fluorescent lights of "The Cleaver & Carnivore" on a Tuesday afternoon. Bartholomew "Bart" Cleaver, a man built like a granite monument and with hands that could crush a grapefruit, surveyed the prime rib with a practiced eye. He could practically smell the history embedded in its deep marbling, a testament to generations of careful breeding and the crisp mountain air it had breathed in its final months. He knew its story before he even touched it, a quiet conversation conducted through the cold, red flesh.

Bart tightened his grip on the bone saw. Today, though, the usual quiet satisfaction he found in his work was muted. He was distracted. The phone hadn't rung with Mrs. Henderson's usual weekly order, and a nagging feeling, like a persistent shard of bone stuck between his teeth, refused to leave him alone.

## Setting:

"The Cleaver & Carnivore" was more than just a butcher shop; it was a legacy carved into the heart of Havenwood, a small, picturesque town nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. The building itself was a testament to longevity: thick stone walls, weathered wooden beams, and a floor perpetually dusted with sawdust. A vintage, hand-painted sign hung above the entrance, depicting a jovial pig in a top hat, a relic from Bart’s grandfather's time.

Inside, the air was thick with the scent of blood, brine, and freshly cut meat. Rows of gleaming stainless steel refrigerators lined the walls, showcasing a curated selection of locally sourced meats: plump sausages, vibrant red steaks, and glistening slabs of pork belly. Behind the counter, a chalkboard displayed the daily specials in Bart's surprisingly elegant script, a stark contrast to his rough exterior.

Havenwood had changed little over the years. It was a place where everyone knew everyone, where front doors were rarely locked, and where the Cleaver family had been providing the finest cuts of meat for generations. But lately, a subtle shift had been occurring, a unease that felt as palpable as the cold chill emanating from the freezers. And Bart, with his inherent connection to the town’s pulse, felt it more keenly than most.
