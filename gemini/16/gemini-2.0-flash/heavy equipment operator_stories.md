The August sun beat down on the cab of the Komatsu PC360LC-11 excavator, turning the interior into a shimmering greenhouse. Sweat trickled down Earl Leroy Patterson's thick neck, plastering his faded blue bandana to his skin. Outside, the air hung thick with the smell of diesel and churned-up earth. He wiped his brow with the back of his calloused hand, the familiar grit of dirt grounding him.

Earl was perched on the edge of a vast scar in the Montana landscape, a wound inflicted by the proposed Black Bear Ridge Ranch development. He was supposed to be a part of building a haven for the wealthy, a gated community nestled amongst the foothills of the Beartooth Mountains. But the landscape, once pristine and teeming with wildlife, now looked like a battlefield. He squinted, the glare off the exposed clay almost blinding.

The setting was brutal. It was the last holdout of the summer heat, the kind that cracked leather and bleached dreams. The surrounding hills, once covered in emerald pine, were now dotted with orange markers, flags denoting property lines and future swimming pools. Dust devils danced across the parched land, miniature cyclones of discontent in a world that was changing too fast for Earl's liking. Heâ€™d been working this land, or land just like it, since he was a boy, helping his pa clear brush for cattle. Now, he was clearing it for millionaires. And every scoop of earth he took felt like a piece of his own soul being hauled away.
