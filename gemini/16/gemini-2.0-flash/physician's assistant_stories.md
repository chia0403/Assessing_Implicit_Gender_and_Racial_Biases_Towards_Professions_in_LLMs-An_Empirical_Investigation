## The Setting:

The crisp autumn air, thick with the scent of damp earth and woodsmoke, snaked its way through the open doorway of the West Branch Clinic. Outside, the quaint town of Havenwood, nestled deep in the heart of the Adirondack Mountains, was preparing for its annual Harvest Festival. String lights, draped precariously across the weathered facades of the antique shops and general stores that lined Main Street, promised a night of cider, bonfires, and the raucous laughter of families. But inside the clinic, the atmosphere was far less celebratory. The fluorescent lights hummed, casting a sterile glow over the linoleum floors and worn examination tables.

The clinic itself was a modest affair, housed in a converted Victorian house with peeling paint and a leaky roof that Dr. Elara Harding, the town's only physician, swore she'd fix “next year.” It was a place where generations had come for comfort, for stitches, and for the gruff wisdom that Dr. Harding dispensed alongside her prescriptions. Today, however, the gruff wisdom felt a little thinner, frayed around the edges with worry.

## The Opening:

A nervous tremor ran through **Esmeralda Maria Rodriguez's** fingers as she carefully examined the x-ray. The image, a stark grayscale representation of a gnarled hand riddled with inflammation, seemed to mock her. "Well, that's not good," she muttered under her breath, pushing her unruly dark hair behind her ear. Esmeralda, Dr. Harding's dedicated Physician's Assistant, had seen her fair share of arthritis cases in her two years at the West Branch Clinic, but this one was particularly aggressive. The patient, Mrs. Willowbrook, was a pillar of the Havenwood community, known for her award-winning apple pies and her tireless volunteer work at the local soup kitchen. The thought of her hands, so instrumental in the town's well-being, crippled by pain, churned in Esmeralda's gut.

She glanced up at the clock, the second hand ticking with maddening urgency. Dr. Harding was late. Again. Usually, Esmeralda would have brushed it off. Elara was notoriously tardy, her days often spilling into unpredictable hours filled with house calls and emergency runs. But this morning, Elara had been scheduled to review Mrs. Willowbrook's case with Esmeralda before the patient arrived, and the unease that had been simmering beneath the surface of Esmeralda's professional composure finally began to boil over. Something wasn’t right. Elara hadn't answered her calls, and her usually vibrant presence was conspicuously absent from the bustling preparations for the Harvest Festival. As Esmeralda stared at the x-ray, a cold dread began to creep into her heart. Where was Elara? And who would care for Havenwood if she was gone?
