The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Mug" cast a sickly green glow across Amelia "Amy" Chen's rain-slicked trench coat.  November in Seattle was living up to its reputation, a relentless drizzle clinging to everything like a second skin.  Amy hunched deeper into her collar, the chill seeping through her layers of wool and thermal underwear.  Across the narrow street, the towering glass and steel edifices of the tech giants loomed, their brightly lit windows showcasing a world she was both intimately familiar with and increasingly alienated from. Amy, a freelance graphic designer, usually thrived in the vibrant pulse of the city, but tonight, the energy felt more oppressive than inspiring.  Her messenger bag, heavy with a rejected logo pitch for a cryptocurrency startup, dug into her shoulder, mirroring the weight in her chest. The Rusty Mug, a haven of chipped mugs, burnt coffee, and surprisingly decent wifi, was her last refuge before admitting defeat and heading back to her tiny studio apartment, which doubled as her office, dining room, and, on particularly rough nights, her crying room.
