The whir of the stand mixer was a comforting lullaby to Eliza June Thistlewick.  Her small bakery, "Sugar & Bloom," nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed antique shop on the cobblestone streets of Oakhaven, was filled with the heady scent of vanilla and almond.  Rain lashed against the large front windows, blurring the view of the usually bustling town square, turning it into an impressionistic painting of greys and muted yellows from the streetlights.  Eliza, dusted with a fine layer of powdered sugar, hummed along to the radio as she meticulously piped buttercream roses onto a three-tiered masterpiece destined for a fiftieth wedding anniversary.  Oakhaven, usually vibrant with tourists drawn to its quaint charm and annual Apple Blossom Festival, felt hushed and intimate in the downpour, and Eliza found a certain peace in it.  The only other sound besides the mixer and the rain was the gentle chime of the bell above the door, signaling an unexpected visitor.
