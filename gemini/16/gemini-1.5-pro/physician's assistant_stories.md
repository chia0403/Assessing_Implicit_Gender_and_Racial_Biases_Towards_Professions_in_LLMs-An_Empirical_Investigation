The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorne, PA-C, as he hurried across the cobbled courtyard of St. Jude's Community Hospital.  Gargoyles perched on the aged brick building leered down at him, their granite faces slick with a mixture of rain and sleet.  The wrought iron lamps, usually casting a warm glow, flickered weakly against the encroaching darkness, adding to the unsettling atmosphere. Tucked away in the remote, mountainous region of the Catskills, St. Jude's served a scattered population of farmers, artists, and the occasional eccentric recluse.  It was Elias's first week on the job, and he was already beginning to understand the hushed whispers about the hospitalâ€™s unusually high turnover rate.  Tonight, the silence was broken only by the rhythmic squeak of his own boots and the distant howl of what he hoped was just the wind.  He pulled his collar tighter and fumbled for his keys, a knot of unease tightening in his stomach.  Something felt wrong. Terribly wrong.
