Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Amelia Grace Hawthorne's office, blurring the already fading twilight view of the Chicago skyline. Fifty stories below, the city lights glimmered like scattered jewels on black velvet.  Amelia, CEO of Hawthorne Industries, a leading robotics firm, tapped a manicured nail against the cool glass, the rhythm mirroring the insistent thrum of anxiety in her chest.  The prototype demonstration for the RX-8, their groundbreaking medical android, was scheduled for tomorrow, and a nagging premonition clung to her like the damp chill permeating the air.  Her usually immaculate office, a testament to minimalist design with its sleek white furniture and polished chrome accents, felt suffocating tonight.  The silence, broken only by the relentless rain and the hum of the advanced climate control system, amplified the weight of the potential consequences riding on the next 24 hours.  Success meant revolutionizing healthcare; failure, a devastating blow to the company her grandfather had built from the ground up.
