The salt spray kissed Amelia Reyes's face, clinging to the fine hairs that escaped her braid. The tang of the ocean mingled with the metallic scent of rust from the crumbling pier beneath her boots.  Grey, pre-dawn light seeped through the gaps in the heavy clouds, casting a ghostly pallor over the deserted beach of Port Blossom, Oregon.  Amelia shifted the weight of her camera bag, a well-worn canvas satchel slung across her shoulder, its contents clinking softly â€“ a collection of lenses she treated with more reverence than most people reserved for religious icons. She'd arrived hours before the sleepy coastal town would even consider stirring, driven by a rumor, a whisper of bioluminescent plankton washing ashore. It was a phenomenon she'd chased for years, a fleeting, ethereal beauty she yearned to capture in a single, perfect frame.  The wind whipped around her, carrying the mournful cry of a distant gull.  This was her hunt, her pilgrimage. The ocean was her canvas, and the light, her paint.
