Rain lashed against the attic window of Eleanor Vanceâ€™s Edinburgh flat, mimicking the relentless drumming in her head.  Loose papers, covered in her spidery red pen marks, fluttered across the worn wooden desk like disturbed leaves. Outside, the wind howled down the narrow closes of the Old Town, a mournful soundtrack to the November night. Eleanor, wrapped in a threadbare cashmere cardigan, hunched over the latest manuscript from Alistair Finch, a self-proclaimed 'visionary' whose prose was as opaque as the peat bogs he romanticized. The flickering gas lamp cast long, distorted shadows across the room, making the stacks of manuscripts lining the walls appear like silent, judging spectators.  The air hung thick with the scent of old books, printer's ink, and the faintest hint of woodsmoke drifting down from the chimney.  At 3 am, with a deadline looming and Finch's incomprehensible ramblings swirling before her eyes, Eleanor Vance, editor extraordinaire, was seriously considering a career change. Perhaps sheep farming. Anything but this.
