The biting wind whipped at Elias Finch's threadbare coat as he surveyed his domain. Not a kingdom, certainly, but to Elias, the sprawling gardens of Athelney House held a majesty all their own.  Athelney House, a gothic monstrosity of weathered stone and ivy, loomed behind him, its many windows like dark eyes staring out at the encroaching November gloom. Frost crunched beneath his worn leather boots, and the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks clawed at the grey sky. Here, in the heart of rural Oxfordshire, nestled between rolling hills and whispering woods, Elias ruled over his kingdom of roses and rhododendrons, of box hedges and manicured lawns, a silent, watchful monarch of the green.  This morning, however, the usual serenity was pierced by a discordant note â€“ a splash of crimson against the frost-silvered grass near the old sundial. Not the vibrant crimson of autumn leaves, but something far more unsettling.
