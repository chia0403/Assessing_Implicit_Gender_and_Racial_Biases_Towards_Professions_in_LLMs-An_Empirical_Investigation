The flickering neon sign of the Starlight Diner cast a lurid, greasy glow across the rain-slicked asphalt of Route 66.  Inside, the air hung thick with the aroma of frying onions, stale coffee, and desperation.  Eleanor Vance, her nametag pinned slightly askew on her faded turquoise uniform, wiped down the sticky Formica countertop for the tenth time in as many minutes.  It was 3:17 am, the witching hour in a town that felt perpetually bewitched, and the only other occupants of the diner were a snoring trucker slumped over a plate of congealed gravy and a colony of fruit flies buzzing around a discarded slice of apple pie.  Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, rattling the dusty windows of the Starlight, a sound that mirrored the gnawing anxiety in Eleanor's stomach.  Something was different tonight. Something feltâ€¦wrong.
