The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face as he wrestled his easel against the fierce Cornish wind.  It buffeted his worn oilskins and threatened to rip the canvas from its moorings, sending it swirling out over the churning Atlantic like some demented seabird. Below him, the cliffs of Porthleven plunged dramatically into the frothing turquoise water, a dizzying drop that made his stomach clench even after years of painting this treacherous, breathtaking vista.  Grey clouds, heavy with the promise of rain, scudded low across the sky, casting an ethereal, almost melancholic light on the little harbour town nestled in the cove.  The air, thick with the smell of brine and seaweed, resonated with the cries of gulls and the rhythmic crash of the waves against the ancient stone pier.  Elias, his ginger hair plastered to his forehead, anchored his easel with a heavy rock and squeezed a dollop of cobalt blue onto his palette, the vibrant colour a stark contrast to the muted tones of the approaching storm.  This was his sanctuary, his obsession, his lifeblood: capturing the raw, untamed beauty of this wild corner of the world.
