The insistent chime of the antique brass bell above the door announced another potential client, slicing through the otherwise peaceful hum of Amelia Hayesâ€™s travel agency. Dust motes danced in the afternoon sunbeams that slanted through the large display window showcasing a breathtaking panorama of the Amalfi Coast.  Amelia Hayes Travel, nestled between a bustling bakery and a perpetually empty storefront on Sycamore Street in the heart of quaint Port Blossom, Maine, was a sanctuary of wanderlust.  Maps dotted with colourful pins, framed vintage travel posters, and a faint scent of sandalwood incense transported anyone who entered to far-off lands, even if only in their imagination. This afternoon, however, Amelia's imagination was firmly rooted in the reality of balancing her dwindling bank account and the rising cost of heating oil, a less glamorous aspect of running a small business in a seaside town during the shoulder season.
