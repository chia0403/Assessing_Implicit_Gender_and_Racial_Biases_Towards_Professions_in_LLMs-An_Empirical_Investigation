Rain lashed against the arched windows of Mrs. Eleanor Vance's office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside sixteen-year-old Maya Rodriguez.  The cramped space, tucked away in a forgotten corner of Northwood High, usually felt cluttered but comforting, with its overflowing bookshelves and mismatched armchairs. Today, however, the worn floral rug and the framed inspirational posters felt oppressive, each a silent witness to Maya's burgeoning panic. Eleanor Vance, a woman whose salt-and-pepper bun was as tightly wound as her schedule, observed the girl with a practiced, patient eye. Outside, the late October wind howled, rattling the already loose pane in the window, a mournful soundtrack to the college application deadline looming just weeks away. Northwood, nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, was a town where autumn arrived in a blaze of glory, but for Maya, this year's vibrant foliage only amplified the sense of impending doom.
