The siren's wail sliced through the humid Charleston night, reflecting off the antebellum mansions lining Meeting Street and bouncing back with a distorted echo. Rain lashed against the windshield of Medic 1 as Amelia “Amy” Grace Calhoun wrestled the ambulance through the slick cobblestone streets.  Spanish moss, heavy with rainwater, swayed like mournful ghosts in the flickering streetlight glow.  Inside the rig, the radio crackled to life, dispatch relaying the fragmented details: possible gunshot wound, victim unresponsive, location: the Battery, near the White Point Garden. Amy gripped the steering wheel tighter, her knuckles white, a familiar knot of tension tightening in her stomach. This wasn't just another call; the Battery was a tourist hotspot, a place of serene beauty now tainted by violence. The humid air inside the ambulance felt thick with anticipation, the smell of antiseptic and the faint metallic tang of old blood clinging to the vinyl seats.  Every second felt stretched, every red light an eternity.
