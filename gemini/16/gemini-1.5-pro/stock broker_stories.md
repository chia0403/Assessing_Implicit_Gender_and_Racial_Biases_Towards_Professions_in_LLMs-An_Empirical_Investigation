Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Elias Thorne's thirty-second-floor office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside him.  The city lights of Chicago glittered like a spilled jewel box below, but Elias saw only the flashing red numbers on his Bloomberg terminal.  They screamed of losses, a digital chorus of failure that threatened to drown out the rhythmic tick of the antique grandfather clock in the corner.  It was a gift from his grandfather, a reminder of simpler times, before the cutthroat world of high-frequency trading and the crushing weight of million-dollar decisions.  The clock, a stoic sentinel of mahogany and brass, chimed seven times, a mournful clang in the sterile modernity of Thorne & Sterling Investments.  Elias rubbed his tired eyes, the faint scent of sandalwood aftershave a ghostly reminder of the last time he'd slept properly.  This, he thought grimly, was not how he envisioned his Tuesday evening.
