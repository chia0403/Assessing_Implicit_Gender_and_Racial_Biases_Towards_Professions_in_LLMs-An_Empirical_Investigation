The rain hammered against the bay window of Dr. Elias Thorne's office, a relentless rhythm that mirrored the anxiety churning in his gut.  His mahogany desk, usually a beacon of order in his otherwise cluttered life, was strewn with files â€“ the messy remnants of a particularly challenging session.  The scent of old books and the faintest hint of pipe tobacco, usually comforting, tonight felt heavy, oppressive. Outside, the neon glow of the "Emerald City Diner" across the street bled through the downpour, casting long, distorted shadows on the rain-slicked pavement of Bleecker Street. Greenwich Village, usually a vibrant tapestry of life and art, felt subdued, hunched against the November chill.  Elias rubbed his tired eyes, the city lights blurring into streaks of color. He had a feeling this night, like so many others recently, was far from over.
