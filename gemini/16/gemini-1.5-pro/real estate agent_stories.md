The crisp October air, scented with woodsmoke and decaying leaves, nipped at Amelia Grace Hawthorne's cheeks as she stood on the porch of Blackwood Manor.  Built in 1889, the Victorian behemoth sprawled across a neglected acre just outside the quaint, touristy town of Oakhaven, Vermont.  Amelia shivered, pulling her tailored camel-hair coat tighter around her.  The wrought-iron gate, rusted and groaning, seemed to sigh in the wind, a sound that mirrored the weary sigh Amelia felt building in her own chest. This listing, with its peeling paint, overgrown gardens, and whispered rumors of hauntings, was proving to be more of a headache than the lucrative quick sale she'd envisioned.  The late afternoon sun, already low in the sky, cast long, skeletal shadows across the overgrown lawn, painting the scene in shades of melancholy. Amelia adjusted her briefcase, the leather creaking in the stillness. This was her last chance to salvage something from this gothic albatross.  If she couldn't find a buyer soon, Blackwood Manor would slip from her grasp, taking a sizable chunk of her commission – and potentially her reputation – with it.
