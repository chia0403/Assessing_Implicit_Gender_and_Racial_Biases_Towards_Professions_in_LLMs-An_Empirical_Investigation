The flickering fluorescent lights of the Grand Majestic Hotel lobby buzzed in a dissonant hum with the whirring of the ancient, brass-caged elevator.  Dust motes danced in the anemic yellow light, illuminating the slightly frayed edges of the worn, burgundy carpet. Amelia “Amy” Grace Hawthorne, perched on her high-backed stool behind the imposing mahogany reception desk, tapped a perfectly manicured, cherry-red nail against the smooth surface.  The lobby was deserted, save for Mr. Henderson, the perpetually drowsy night porter, who snored softly in a velvet armchair tucked away in a shadowy corner.  Outside, the biting November wind howled through the canyons of Manhattan, rattling the grand oak doors and whispering promises of snow.  It was 3:17 AM, the quietest hour in the oldest, and arguably most haunted, hotel in New York City. And Amy, usually unflappable, felt a prickle of unease crawl up her spine.
