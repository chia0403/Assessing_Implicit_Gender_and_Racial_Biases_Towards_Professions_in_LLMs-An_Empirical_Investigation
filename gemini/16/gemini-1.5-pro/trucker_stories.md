The Nevada sun, a brutal, shimmering hammer, beat down on the cab of the eighteen-wheeler. Beatrice "Bea" Rodriguez squinted, her hand instinctively rising to shield her eyes.  Dust devils danced across the scorched earth, mimicking the heat rising in waves from the asphalt of Highway 50, aptly nicknamed "The Loneliest Road in America."  Her Kenworth W900, christened "La Reina," rumbled beneath her, a loyal steed carrying her cargo of pre-fab housing units towards Ely.  Bea, with her salt-and-pepper braid peeking out from under her worn trucker cap and a faint scent of coffee and diesel clinging to her denim jacket, felt a familiar pang of solitude, a sensation as vast and open as the landscape surrounding her.  Mile marker 153 ticked by, swallowed by the shimmering heat haze.  This stretch of highway, where the mountains met the desert in a jagged embrace, had always been her least favourite. But today, the air felt different, charged with a strange, almost electric anticipation.  Bea couldn't shake the feeling that this trip wouldn't be like the others.
