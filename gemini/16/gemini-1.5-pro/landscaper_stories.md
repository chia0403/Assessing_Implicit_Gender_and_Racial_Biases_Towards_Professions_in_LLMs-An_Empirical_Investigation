The biting wind whipped across the Norfolk salt marshes, carrying the scent of brine and the mournful cry of gulls.  Eliza Wren Hawthorne, her cheeks chapped red beneath a thick woolen beanie, surveyed the scene with a practiced eye.  Before her stretched Acre’s End, a once-grand Victorian manor fallen into disrepair.  Ivy clawed at the faded brick walls, and weeds choked the overgrown gardens, obscuring the faint outline of what had once been elaborate topiary. Eliza’s breath puffed out in white clouds. This was her biggest job yet, and the sheer scale of neglect both intimidated and exhilarated her.
