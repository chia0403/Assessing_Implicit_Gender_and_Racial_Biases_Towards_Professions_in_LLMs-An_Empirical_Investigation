The biting November wind whipped strands of Amelia Iris Thorne's auburn hair across her face, momentarily obscuring her view of the churning grey sea.  She shivered, pulling her threadbare coat tighter around her and hunching deeper into the alcove of the crumbling stone lighthouse.  Salt spray kissed her skin, a familiar tang that was as much a part of her as the charcoal smudged beneath her fingernails.  Port Blossom, a once-thriving fishing village now clinging precariously to the cliffs of the Cornish coast, was her sanctuary, her muse, her prison.  The lighthouse, abandoned and slated for demolition, was her studio.  Here, amidst the peeling paint and rusted metal, Amelia wrestled with her demons and poured her soul onto canvases, capturing the raw beauty of a dying town and the relentless power of the sea that both sustained and threatened it. The air was thick with the scent of brine and the ghostly cries of gulls, a soundtrack to the melancholic masterpiece she was about to begin.
