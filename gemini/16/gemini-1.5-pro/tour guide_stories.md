The humid air hung thick and heavy, tasting of salt and plumeria.  A symphony of cicadas thrummed from the dense emerald canopy overhead, punctuated by the distant shrieks of unseen monkeys.  Eliza Vivienne Holloway adjusted the brim of her wide-brimmed Panama hat, shielding her eyes from the relentless Costa Rican sun. Her crisp linen shirt, already clinging damply to her back, was tucked neatly into khaki cargo pants, and a pair of well-worn hiking boots completed the ensemble – the uniform of a seasoned tour guide.  She stood at the edge of a weathered wooden platform overlooking the yawning chasm of the Arenal Hanging Bridges, a network of precarious walkways strung between the towering rainforest giants.  Below, the emerald canopy stretched across the valley, concealing the roiling, sulfuric breath of the Arenal Volcano, a slumbering giant only visible today as a distant hazy cone.  Eliza tapped her microphone, a nervous habit she’d yet to break, despite having led hundreds of tours through the rainforest.  “Alright everyone, welcome to the gateway to the cloud forest…” she began, her voice amplified slightly across the hushed gathering of tourists, their faces a mixture of excitement and apprehension.  This was the first stop on their week-long adventure, and for some, the first time they’d ever stepped foot in a real jungle. Little did they know, this particular tour was about to be unlike any Eliza, or they, had ever experienced.
