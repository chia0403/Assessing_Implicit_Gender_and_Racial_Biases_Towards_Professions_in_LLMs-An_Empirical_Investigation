The bell above the door of "Petal & Plume" tinkled merrily, a counterpoint to the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of Eliza Jane Worthingtonâ€™s shears.  Outside, the cobbled streets of Little Puddleton shimmered under a rare June heatwave, the air thick with the scent of honeysuckle from the overflowing baskets hanging outside the tea shop opposite.  Inside, however, the air was cool and fragrant, a symphony of rose, freesia, and the earthy, comforting aroma of damp moss. Eliza Jane, a woman whose vibrant auburn hair was always haphazardly twisted into a loose bun, was engrossed in coaxing a stubborn sprig of ivy into submission for a particularly elaborate funeral wreath.  Sunlight, fractured by the stained-glass window depicting a riot of sunflowers, splashed across the worn wooden floorboards, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the air like tiny, iridescent fairies.  Little Puddleton might have been a sleepy village where nothing much ever happened, but inside Petal & Plume, Eliza Jane's world was a constant bloom of creativity and quiet contemplation. That was, until the hearse pulled up outside, and a woman dressed entirely in black, her face veiled, stepped out, carrying a single, blood-red rose.
