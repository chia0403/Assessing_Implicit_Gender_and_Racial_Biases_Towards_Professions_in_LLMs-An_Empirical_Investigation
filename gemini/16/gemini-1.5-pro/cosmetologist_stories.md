The flickering neon sign of "Shear Radiance Salon" cast a lavender glow across the rain-slicked streets of Zenith, Pennsylvania.  Inside, amidst the hum of hair dryers and the scent of coconut-infused shampoo,  Elara Juniper Hastings meticulously blended a shade of "Midnight Amethyst" hair dye. Rain hammered against the large front window, blurring the view of the nearly deserted Main Street. It was a slow Tuesday evening, the kind where Elara had more time to practice her elaborate braiding techniques on a mannequin head named Beatrice, rather than on the heads of Zenith's moreâ€¦conservative clientele. Tonight, however, the quiet was about to be shattered. A sudden, sharp rapping at the door, followed by a frantic jiggling of the handle, made Elara jump, nearly spilling the vibrant purple dye onto Beatrice's perfectly coiffed (and synthetic) blonde locks.
