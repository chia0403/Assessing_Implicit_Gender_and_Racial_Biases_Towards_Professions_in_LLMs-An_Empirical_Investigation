The biting November wind whipped around Eleanor Vance, plastering stray strands of her auburn hair across her chapped lips.  She tugged her threadbare scarf tighter around her neck, the damp wool offering little solace against the chill that seemed to emanate not just from the air, but from the crumbling brick walls of the Grand Majestic Theatre itself.  Built in 1908, the Majestic had once been the jewel of downtown Harmony Springs, Ohio, a beacon of art and culture in an otherwise unremarkable Midwestern town.  Now, chipped paint peeled from the ornate façade like sunburnt skin, and the once-grand marquee hung askew, its flickering bulbs proclaiming the upcoming production of “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” with a distinct lack of enthusiasm.  Eleanor, however, burned with a different kind of fire.  This production, her directorial debut at the Majestic, was her chance.  Her chance to revive not just Shakespeare’s magic, but the magic of the theatre itself, a magic she desperately believed still lingered within these dusty, forgotten walls.
