The insistent Vermont wind howled a mournful ballad around the eaves of Dr. Elias Thorne's clapboard dental practice, rattling the antique "Thorne Family Dentistry" sign that hung precariously above the porch.  Snow, fine and relentless, swirled in miniature cyclones across the frost-covered windowpanes, obscuring the view of the frozen Connecticut River just beyond. Inside, the waiting room was a study in comforting beige and worn-out magazines, warmed by the low hum of a space heater struggling against the encroaching chill. Elias, his breath clouding in the frigid air leaking from beneath the ancient door, stamped his feet on the threadbare rug, a vague unease settling in his stomach. It wasn't just the weather, though January in Bellows Falls was notoriously brutal.  Something felt...off. The usual quiet Tuesday morning torpor that settled over the town seemed heavier, more oppressive, and the silence, broken only by the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner, was thick with a tension Elias couldn't quite name.
