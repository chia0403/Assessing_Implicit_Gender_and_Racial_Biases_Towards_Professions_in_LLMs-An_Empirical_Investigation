The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, stinging Amelia "Amy" Thorne's cheeks as she wrestled the heavy antenna into place atop the rickety lighthouse. Flakes of rust, dislodged by her efforts, rained down on her thick wool coat.  The sky, a bruised purple-grey, mirrored the turbulent waters below.  Out here on Seal Rock, a lonely islet ten miles off the Northumberland coast, the only sounds were the mournful cry of gulls and the rhythmic crash of waves against the jagged rocks. The lighthouse, her temporary home and sole companion, was a crumbling testament to a bygone era, its white paint peeling like sunburnt skin.  Amy, bundled against the chill, tightened the last bolt on the antenna, her breath clouding the air.  This repair, a vital link to the mainland for the automated weather station housed within the lighthouse, was supposed to be a simple in-and-out job.  But Seal Rock, notorious for its unpredictable weather, seemed determined to make it anything but.
