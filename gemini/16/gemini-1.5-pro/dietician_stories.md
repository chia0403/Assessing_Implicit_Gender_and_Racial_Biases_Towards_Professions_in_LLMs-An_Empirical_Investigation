The insistent Florida sun, even at 7:00 am, beat down on the turquoise awning of "Nourish," Amelia Reyes' small dietetics practice.  Palm trees swayed lazily in the humid air, their fronds casting dappled shadows on the pastel-painted buildings lining Ocean Drive in Vero Beach.  Inside, the cool air conditioning hummed a gentle counterpoint to the rhythmic crash of waves just a block away. Amelia Reyes, a registered dietician with a penchant for vibrant tropical fruits and a deep-seated dislike for fad diets, adjusted the hand-painted pineapple that sat atop her desk.  It was a slow Tuesday morning, the kind where the only sound was the whir of the blender she used to whip up her famous green smoothies for clients, and the gentle clinking of wind chimes hanging by the open window. Little did she know, this calm was about to be shattered by a client unlike any she'd ever encountered.
