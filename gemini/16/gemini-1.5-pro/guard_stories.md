The biting wind whipped across the Obsidian Cliffs, stinging Elias Thorne's cheeks even through his thick fur-lined hood.  Ice crunched beneath his worn leather boots as he patrolled the edge of the precipice, the only sound besides the mournful cry of the windhawks circling high above.

Elias tightened his grip on the haft of his halberd, the cold metal a familiar comfort in this desolate place. For five years he'd been a Warden of the Cliffs, stationed at Outpost Theta, a lonely granite tower perched precariously close to the edge, its sole purpose to watch for the return of the Shadowkin from their exile in the fog-shrouded lands below.  Five years of wind, ice, and the gnawing fear that tonight, the fog might finally conceal something far worse than the howling wind.
