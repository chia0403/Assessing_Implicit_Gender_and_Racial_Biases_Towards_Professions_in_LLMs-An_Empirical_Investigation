The scent of old paper and beeswax hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma Eleanor Vance had come to associate with sanctuary. Outside, the November wind howled a mournful tune around the eaves of the Briarwood Public Library, rattling the diamond-paned windows. Rain lashed against the glass, blurring the already fading light of the late afternoon. Inside, however, a warm, golden glow emanated from the brass reading lamps scattered amongst the towering oak bookshelves. Eleanor, perched precariously on a rolling ladder, adjusted the spine of a particularly weighty volume on Victorian poetry.  Briarwood, nestled deep in the Vermont mountains, was a town steeped in history and hushed secrets, and its library, with its creaking floors and hidden alcoves, held more than just books within its walls. It held stories whispered on the wind, memories tucked away in dusty corners, and a mystery that Eleanor was about to unwittingly stumble upon.
