The rhythmic snip-snip-snip of shears echoed through the small, cluttered shop, punctuated by the occasional thump of a well-worn iron. Dust motes danced in the afternoon sunbeams that slanted through the grimy windowpanes of "A Stitch in Time," illuminating bolts of cloth in every shade imaginable.  Emerald greens, sapphire blues, ruby reds, and even a shimmering cloth of woven gold thread were stacked haphazardly against the walls, vying for space amongst overflowing baskets of buttons, spools of thread, and half-finished garments.  Elias Thorne, a man whose nimble fingers seemed to possess a magic all their own, meticulously pinned a length of midnight blue velvet to a mannequin.

He hummed a tuneless melody, his brow furrowed in concentration as he envisioned the elegant frock coat that would soon take shape beneath his skilled hands.  Little did he know, this coat, destined for the town's enigmatic new mayor, would unravel a secret that threatened to tear the very fabric of Hollow Creek apart.
