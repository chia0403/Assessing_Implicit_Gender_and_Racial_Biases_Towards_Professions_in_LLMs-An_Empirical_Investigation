The clatter of a horse-drawn carriage rattled the windowpanes of  "Mademoiselle Elodie Beaumont, Dressmaker," a small but exquisitely appointed shop tucked between a bustling bakery and a perpetually dusty bookstore on Rue Victor Hugo in the heart of Belle Ã‰poque Paris.  Rain, the colour of charcoal sketches, lashed against the glass, blurring the already fading light of a late November afternoon. Inside, Elodie Beaumont, her auburn hair pinned back in a severe chignon that did little to tame the unruly curls escaping around her temples, knelt amidst a swirl of emerald green silk.  The air hung thick with the scent of lavender and the faint, metallic tang of needles, a familiar perfume that always calmed her.  A half-finished ball gown, destined for the Duchess de Valois's winter solstice gala, lay draped across a dress form, a shimmering promise of elegance yet to be fully realized.  Elodie sighed, a delicate puff of air that stirred the loose threads clinging to her ink-stained fingertips.  The Duchess was notoriously demanding, and this particular shade of green, a colour Elodie had painstakingly mixed herself, had been rejected twice already.  A third rejection, Elodie knew, could spell disaster for her fledgling business.
