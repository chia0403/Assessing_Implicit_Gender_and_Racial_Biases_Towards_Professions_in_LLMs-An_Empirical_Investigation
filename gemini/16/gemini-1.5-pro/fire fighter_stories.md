The biting wind howled through the skeletal remains of the abandoned textile mill, whipping Amelia “Millie” Reyes’s dark hair across her face.  Flakes of snow, the first of the season, danced in the swirling vortex of ash and smoke billowing from the gaping windows.  Crimson flames licked greedily at the decaying wood, illuminating the dilapidated brick facade with a macabre glow.  The mill, a hulking behemoth that had once been the lifeblood of Ashworth, Pennsylvania, now stood as a testament to the town's slow decline, and tonight, it was going up in a blaze of tragic glory.  Millie, her turnout gear already radiating heat, tightened the strap of her helmet, the acrid smell of burning wool and timber stinging her nostrils.  The roar of the inferno mingled with the frantic shouts of her fellow firefighters, creating a chaotic symphony against the backdrop of the desolate, snow-dusted landscape. This wasn’t just a fire; it was the funeral pyre of Ashworth’s last hope.
