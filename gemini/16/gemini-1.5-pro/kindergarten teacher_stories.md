The insistent chirping of a rogue cricket, somehow trapped within the brightly painted walls of Mrs. Eleanor Vance’s kindergarten classroom, was the soundtrack to the pre-dawn quiet.  Sunlight, still pale and hesitant, filtered through the large window overlooking the playground, casting long shadows from the miniature plastic kitchen and the towering block castle in the corner.  Rainbow Daycare, nestled in the heart of sleepy Willow Creek, Oregon, was usually a hive of gleeful chaos, a whirlwind of finger paint, sticky fingers, and enthusiastically sung nursery rhymes. But at this hour, it belonged only to Eleanor and the cricket, whose chirping echoed in the stillness, a tiny counterpoint to the rushing murmur of Willow Creek itself, just audible beyond the playground fence.  Eleanor, her dark hair pulled back in a messy bun, knelt amidst a scattering of construction paper and glitter glue, preparing for the day’s art project: handprint turkeys, a Thanksgiving tradition she cherished.  A faint scent of pine needles and cinnamon, remnants of yesterday’s festive sensory bin, hung in the air, mingling with the crisp autumn air drifting in through the slightly ajar window.
