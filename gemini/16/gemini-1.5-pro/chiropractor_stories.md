The rusty weathervane atop the old Victorian, once a proud rooster, now resembled a mangled pigeon, mirroring the state of Dr. Elias Thorne's mood.  Rain lashed against the stained-glass windows of his practice, Thorne Chiropractic, located on the eerily quiet end of Oakhaven’s Main Street.  The small town, nestled deep within the Redwood National Park in Northern California, was typically shrouded in mist, but tonight, the downpour felt less like a natural phenomenon and more like a pathetic fallacy reflecting Elias’s inner turmoil. His last patient had cancelled, blaming the weather, leaving Elias alone with the ticking grandfather clock in the waiting room and the persistent drip, drip, drip from a leak he’d been meaning to fix for months.  The scent of eucalyptus and damp wood hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma usually, but tonight it only amplified the oppressive silence.
