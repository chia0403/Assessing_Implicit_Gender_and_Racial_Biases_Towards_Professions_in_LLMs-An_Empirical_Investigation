The wind whipped down the slopes of Mount Cinder, rattling the loose shale that clung precariously to its volcanic flanks.  Grey dust, the pulverised bones of the mountain, swirled around Elias Thorne, stinging his eyes and coating his calloused hands with a gritty film. Elias, his full name Elias Blackwood Thorne, a man carved from the same stubborn rock he worked, squinted at the setting sun, a bruised plum in the ashen sky.  His workshop, nestled in a shallow cave halfway up the mountain, offered little comfort. It was a space dominated by the scent of dust and sweat, the floor littered with chips of obsidian, basalt, and the occasional glint of precious volcanic glass.  Carved into the back wall, a niche held a single flickering candle, casting long, dancing shadows that mimicked the swaying pines on the lower slopes.  Tonight, however, the usual quiet hum of anticipation that Elias felt before beginning a new carving was absent.  A knot of unease tightened in his gut, a premonition as hard and cold as the obsidian blade in his hand.
