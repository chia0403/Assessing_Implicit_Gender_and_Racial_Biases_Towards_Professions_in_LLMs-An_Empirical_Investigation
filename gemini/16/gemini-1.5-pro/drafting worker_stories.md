The flickering fluorescent lights of the D&M Drafting office buzzed in Amelia Reyes's ears, a constant, irritating hum that mirrored the low thrum of anxiety in her chest. Outside, the Chicago wind howled, rattling the single-pane window beside her desk and spitting icy rain against the glass.  January in the city was always brutal, but this year felt particularly sharp, mirroring the biting precariousness of her situation. Amelia traced the outline of the high-rise condominium complex on her blueprint, the lines blurring slightly as she squinted.  Each meticulous measurement, each perfectly rendered detail, represented not just a building, but a lifeline. This project, the "Lakeshore Grande," was D&M's biggest commission in years, and Amelia, despite her junior status, had been entrusted with a significant portion of the drafting work.  If it went well, it could mean a promotion, a raise, maybe even enough to finally move out of her cramped studio apartment and into a place with actual sunlight. If it didn't… well, she didn’t even want to think about that.
