The biting November wind whipped off the East River, stinging Amelia “Amy” Reyes’s cheeks as she surveyed the desolate pier.  Abandoned warehouses, their brick faces scarred with graffiti and streaked with grime, loomed against the bruised twilight sky.  Broken glass crunched under her worn leather boots, a counterpoint to the mournful cry of a distant foghorn.  This forgotten corner of Brooklyn, a place most New Yorkers avoided after dark, was precisely what Amy needed. It echoed the gritty, unforgiving world of "Fade Out," the noir thriller she was about to bring to life, a story as bleak and beautiful as the dying light reflecting on the oily water below.  This wasn’t just a location scout; it was a pilgrimage to the heart of her film’s soul.
