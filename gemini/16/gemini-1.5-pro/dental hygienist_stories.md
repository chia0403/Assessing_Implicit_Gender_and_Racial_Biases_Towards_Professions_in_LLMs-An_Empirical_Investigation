The fluorescent lights of Aspen Dental hummed a monotonous tune above Amelia Rose Hawthorne, reflecting in the stark white of her pristine lab coat.  It was a Tuesday morning in late October in Harmony Creek, Pennsylvania, a town so idyllically named it felt almost ironic considering the persistent drizzle and perpetual overcast sky. Outside, the wind whipped fallen leaves into frenzied spirals against the large picture window that showcased the perpetually empty parking lot of Harmony Creek’s only strip mall. Amelia adjusted her mask, the faint scent of mint antiseptic filling her nostrils, a smell she’d long grown accustomed to, but which still held a faint clinical edge. Mrs. Higgins, her 8:00 a.m. appointment, was late, which wasn't unusual.  Amelia glanced at the clock, its red digital numbers glowing malevolently.  8:07.  She sighed, a puff of air escaping the edges of her mask, fogging her protective eyewear. This was the calm before the storm.  Tuesdays were notoriously busy, and Mrs. Higgins’ tardiness meant the entire schedule would be thrown off, a domino effect of dental anxieties and plaque build-up.
