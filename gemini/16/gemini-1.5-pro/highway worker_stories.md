The sun, a malevolent eye in the bruised-purple pre-dawn sky, beat down on Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez's orange vest.  Heat shimmered off the asphalt of Interstate 80, blurring the Nevada desert landscape into an undulating, ochre wave. Amy, perched precariously on the back of a pothole patching truck, squinted at the shimmering mirage. Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of sand and grit, danced across the barren plains, spiraling towards the distant, sawtooth peaks of the Humboldt Range.  The air, thick with the smell of creosote and diesel fumes, crackled with the static of the truck's radio, tuned to a country station out of Winnemucca. This stretch of I-80, a lonely ribbon of black bisecting the vast emptiness between Lovelock and Battle Mountain, was Amy's domain. For five years, she'd been patching, sealing, and generally battling the constant decay of this unforgiving stretch of highway, a silent sentinel against the encroaching desert. Today, however, felt different.  A low hum, almost imperceptible beneath the drone of the engine, vibrated through the metal of the truck, a discordant note in the usual symphony of the desert.
