The relentless Michigan wind howled a mournful tune through the skeletal branches of the elm trees lining Maple Street, whipping Detective Isabella "Izzy" Diaz's dark hair across her face.  The biting November air, sharp enough to slice through her standard-issue wool coat, carried the metallic tang of lake-effect snow and something else, something faintly acrid, like burnt toast.  Izzy squinted at the two-story Victorian looming before her, its gingerbread trim obscured by shadows. Number 27 Maple Street. The porch light swung precariously in the wind, casting erratic streaks of yellow across the peeling paint and the overgrown ivy that clawed at the clapboard. This was her third call-out to this address in as many months, each for increasingly strange disturbances. Tonight, it was a silent alarm, triggered at precisely 3:17 AM.  The dispatch call had simply stated: "Possible break-in.  No response from occupants."  But something about the stillness of the house, the unnatural quiet that swallowed the windâ€™s howl, prickled the hairs on the back of Izzy's neck.
