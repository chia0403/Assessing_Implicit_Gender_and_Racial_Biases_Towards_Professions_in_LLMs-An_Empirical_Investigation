The flickering neon sign of "Rosie's Rods and Rides" cast a greasy, rainbow sheen across the slick asphalt of the small-town garage.  Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless drumming that echoed the anxiety churning in Elina "Ellie" Rodriguez's stomach.  Water dripped through a crack in the ceiling, landing with a plip-plop in a rusty bucket perched precariously on a stack of worn tires.  The air hung thick with the scent of motor oil, burnt rubber, and the faint, metallic tang of impending trouble.  Huddled in the dim light of a single bare bulb hanging over a disemboweled '67 Mustang, Ellie tightened her wrench on a stubborn bolt, her knuckles white against the grime.  Dust motes danced in the beams of her headlamp, illuminating the worried furrow in her brow.  Tonight wasn't about fixing a classic car; tonight was about fixing a much bigger problem, one that threatened to tear her whole world apart.
