The air in "Body By Beatrice" hung thick with the aroma of sweat and lemon-scented disinfectant. Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the mirrored walls.  Rain lashed against the large windows overlooking downtown Chicago, blurring the cityscape into a hazy, impressionistic painting.  Beatrice “Bea” Rodriguez, clad in vibrant turquoise leggings and a matching sports bra, adjusted her headset microphone, a determined glint in her eye.  It was 6:00 AM on a Tuesday, and while most of the city still slumbered, Bea's dedicated tribe of early-bird fitness fanatics were already filing in, ready to sweat, stretch, and sculpt their way to a better version of themselves.  The rhythmic thump of a bass-heavy playlist pulsed through the studio, a siren call to action in the otherwise quiet morning.
