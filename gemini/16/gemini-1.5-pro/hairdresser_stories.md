The iridescent glow of the "Curl Up & Dye" sign buzzed erratically, casting a flickering neon rainbow across the rain-slicked asphalt of Harmony Street.  Inside, Amelia Grace Hawthorne, her name embroidered in elegant script on her crisp white smock, sighed, watching the downpour through the salon’s large front window.  Harmony Street, usually bustling with the chatter of locals and the rhythmic clang of the tram, was deserted. The only sound besides the drumming rain was the gentle whir of the ancient hairdryer perched precariously on a chipped porcelain sink.  Amelia ran a hand through her own vibrant turquoise bob, a stark contrast to the muted grey of the day, and wondered if she’d even have a single client. It was a Tuesday, usually her busiest day, but this relentless November rain seemed determined to wash away even the most dedicated perm appointment.  The bell above the door chimed, a surprisingly cheerful sound in the gloom, and Amelia plastered a welcoming smile on her face, hoping it wouldn’t appear too forced.
