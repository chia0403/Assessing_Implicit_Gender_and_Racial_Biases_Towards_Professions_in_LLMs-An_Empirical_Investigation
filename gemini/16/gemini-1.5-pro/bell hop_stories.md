Crystal chandeliers dripped with light, illuminating the swirling patterns of the marble floor and the vibrant tapestry depicting a hunt scene, complete with hounds and hilariously inaccurate depictions of foxes. The air thrummed with the low murmur of conversations, the clinking of ice in cocktail glasses, and the faint scent of lilies from the monstrous arrangements flanking the reception desk.  Nineteen-year-old Fitzwilliam "Fitz" Archibald Peabody the Third, resplendent in his burgundy uniform with gold braiding, straightened his pillbox hat and plastered a welcoming smile on his face.
