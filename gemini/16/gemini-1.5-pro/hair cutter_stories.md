The air hung thick with the scent of talcum powder and bay rum, a comforting aroma that hadn't changed in the thirty years Elias had been cutting hair in this very spot.  Today, however, a strange tension buzzed beneath the usual calm.  A black Cadillac, polished to a mirror sheen and utterly out of place in Oakhaven, was parked directly outside, its engine softly purring like a contented panther.
