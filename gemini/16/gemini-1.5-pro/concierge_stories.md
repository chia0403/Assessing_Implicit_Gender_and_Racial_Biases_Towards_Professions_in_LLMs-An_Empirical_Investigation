The opulent lobby of the Grand Majestic Hotel hummed with a low, constant thrum, a symphony of hushed conversations, the clinking of fine china from the Palm Court, and the rhythmic swoosh of the revolving doors admitting a steady stream of impeccably dressed guests.  Crystal chandeliers, each a miniature galaxy of sparkling light, cast a warm glow over the polished marble floors.  Behind the imposing, mahogany concierge desk, Elias Thorne, his name tag gleaming gold against his crisp navy suit, surveyed the scene with an unflappable calm.  Outside, the biting November wind howled through the canyons of Manhattan, but within the Grand Majestic, it was a perpetual spring of perfectly controlled temperature and exquisitely arranged floral displays. Elias, a veteran of the hospitality industry for fifteen years, knew the rhythms of the hotel as intimately as a conductor knows a symphony.  Tonight, however, a discordant note was about to be struck.
