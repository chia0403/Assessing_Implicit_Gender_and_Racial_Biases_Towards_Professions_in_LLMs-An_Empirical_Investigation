Beatrice, her auburn hair neatly pinned beneath a smart navy hat, sat ramrod straight, her fingers flying across the keys as she transcribed a letter for Mr. Henderson, the perpetually flustered president of Henderson’s Haberdashery.  Outside, the city bustled with the energy of a burgeoning post-war America, but within the confines of her small office, Beatrice’s world was one of precise order and quiet efficiency.  Little did she know, this Tuesday would be anything but ordinary.
