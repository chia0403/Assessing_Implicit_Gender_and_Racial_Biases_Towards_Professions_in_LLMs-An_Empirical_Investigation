The neon glow of "Pillars Apothecary" spilled onto the rain-slicked streets of Hollow Creek, a town nestled so deep in the Appalachian Mountains that GPS often forgot it existed. Inside, amongst the comforting scent of chamomile and the slightly less comforting aroma of antiseptic, Dr. Elias Thorne, PharmD, meticulously counted out metformin tablets, the rhythmic click a familiar counterpoint to the mournful wail of a distant train.  It was a Tuesday night, the kind where even the stray dogs had found shelter from the downpour, and Elias expected the only company for the rest of his shift to be the blinking red eye of the security camera in the corner. Hollow Creek rarely needed anything after sundown, except perhaps a balm for the loneliness that seemed to seep from the mountains themselves.  Tonight, however, proved to be an exception.  The bell above the door chimed, announcing a visitor, and Elias looked up, expecting to see a frantic parent needing childrenâ€™s Tylenol. Instead, a woman stood dripping on the welcome mat, her face obscured by the shadow of a wide-brimmed hat, a battered suitcase clutched in her gloved hand.
