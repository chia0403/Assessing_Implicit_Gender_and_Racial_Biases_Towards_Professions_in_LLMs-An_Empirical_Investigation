The biting wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's auburn braid across her cheek as she trudged across the frozen mud of the Yorkshire Wildlife Sanctuary.  Dawn was barely a smudge of grey on the eastern horizon, painting the skeletal branches of the oak trees a chilling silver.  The sanctuary, nestled in a sheltered valley between two towering moors, was normally a haven of rustling leaves and birdsong.  This morning, however, it was gripped by a stark, almost eerie silence, broken only by the crunch of Amy's boots and the distant, mournful howl of a lone wolf housed in the newly built enclosure at the far end of the property.  The air, sharp and clean, carried the scent of pine needles and something else, something faintly metallic, that prickled the hairs on the back of Amy's neck and made her quicken her pace.
