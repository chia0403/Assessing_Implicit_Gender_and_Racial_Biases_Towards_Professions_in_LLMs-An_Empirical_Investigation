The muted clang of the trolley as it trundled past shook the frosted windowpanes of Elias Finch's office, sending a cascade of miniature avalanches down the accumulated snow. Elias, whose full name was Elias Peregrine Finch, meticulously adjusted his spectacles, then returned to the task at hand – reconciling the ledger for the Grimshaw Brothers' Haberdashery.

The year was 1923, a time of flapper dresses, jazz music, and, in Elias’s world, an unending stream of receipts for silk stockings and bowlers hats.  He preferred the quiet rhythm of numbers to the roar of the changing times, finding solace in the precise balance of debits and credits, a world far removed from the uncertain rustle of whispers that seemed to permeate every corner of Hollow Creek.
