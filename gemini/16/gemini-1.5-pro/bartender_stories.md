The flickering neon sign of "The Gilded Lily" cast a lurid, lavender glow across the rain-slicked cobblestones of Bleaker Street.  Inside, the air hung thick with the mingled scents of stale beer, cheap perfume, and desperation.  Rain hammered against the grimy windows, a relentless soundtrack to the quiet misery unfolding within.  Behind the scarred mahogany bar, Elias Thorne, his face etched with weariness that belied his twenty-eight years, polished a glass with a practiced, circular motion.  His dark hair, usually neatly combed, was disheveled, a few strands clinging to his forehead.  He wore a faded white shirt, the sleeves rolled up to reveal forearms corded with muscle, and a black waistcoat that had seen better days.  The Lily wasn't much, but it was his, inherited from his grandfather, a man Elias barely remembered but whose presence still seemed to linger in the chipped porcelain mugs and the faint aroma of pipe tobacco that clung to the worn leather booths. Tonight, however, even the familiar comfort of the Lily felt oppressive, a premonition of something bad brewing on the horizon.
