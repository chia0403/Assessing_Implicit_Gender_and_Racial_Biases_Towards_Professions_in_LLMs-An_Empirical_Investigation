The pre-dawn chill bit through Finnigan "Finn" O'Malley's work jacket like an icy nail.  He stamped his steel-toed boots on the frost-covered pavement, the sharp clang echoing in the stillness of the half-built skyscraper's skeleton.  Fifty stories above the still-sleeping city of Chicago, the wind howled through the exposed girders, a lonely symphony of steel and cold.  Finn squinted up at the web of metal against the slowly lightening eastern sky.  Another day, another floor closer to topping out.  He pulled a thermos of coffee from his lunch pail, the metallic scent mingling with the sharp tang of welding fumes still lingering from yesterday's work.  The Willis Tower loomed across the street, its black silhouette a silent giant watching over Finn and the nascent titan rising beside it. This new behemoth, christened "The Zenith," was Finn's current obsession, a concrete and glass testament to human ambition that he was helping to forge, beam by painstaking beam.
