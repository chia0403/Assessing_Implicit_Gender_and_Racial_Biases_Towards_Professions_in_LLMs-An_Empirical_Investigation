The aroma of burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the usual sweet perfume that emanated from Beatrice "Bea" Flournoy's bakery.  Bea, her flour-dusted apron clinging to her like a second skin, stood frozen before the open oven, her hazel eyes wide with dismay. The batch of lavender and honey macarons, destined for Mayor Thompson's garden party, were now charcoal crisps.  Outside, the cobbled streets of Wicklow Harbor shimmered under a relentless July sun, the salty tang of the Irish Sea drifting in through the open bakery door.  Seagulls cried overhead, their raucous calls mocking Bea's silent despair.  The Buttercup Bakery, usually a haven of warmth and deliciousness, felt suddenly stifling, the air thick with the scent of failure.
