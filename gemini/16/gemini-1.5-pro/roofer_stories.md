The tar hissed and bubbled under the August sun, releasing a pungent, almost sweet aroma that clung to Elijah Vance like a second skin.  He knelt on the scorching shingles of Mrs. Henderson's Victorian, the slate-grey expanse stretching out before him like a miniature, heat-baked ocean.  Far below, the sleepy town of Oakhaven, Missouri drowsed in the summer haze, its church spire a needle pointing accusingly at the cloudless sky.  Elijah wiped a bead of sweat from his brow with the back of his calloused hand, leaving a streak of black against his already sun-darkened skin.  A rusted weather vane, shaped like a rooster, creaked in the light breeze, its mournful cry the only sound besides the sizzle of the tar and the distant drone of a lawnmower.  This was Elijah's world â€“ a precarious landscape of sloping roofs and dizzying heights, where the only constants were the burning sun and the ever-present risk of a long, hard fall.  Today, however, something felt different.  A shiver, unrelated to the heat, traced its way down his spine, leaving a prickle of unease in its wake.
