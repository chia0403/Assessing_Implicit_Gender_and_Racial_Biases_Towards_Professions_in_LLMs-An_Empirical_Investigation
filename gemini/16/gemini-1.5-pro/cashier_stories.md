The fluorescent lights of the Quick Stop hummed a monotonous B-flat, a soundtrack that Eliza Jane Cartwright had grown accustomed to over her five years manning register three.  Outside, the Nevada sun beat down on the cracked asphalt of the parking lot, baking the air to a shimmering haze. Dust devils danced across the deserted landscape, occasionally swirling past the grimy windows, offering a fleeting glimpse of the desolate beauty of the Mojave Desert.  Inside, the air conditioning struggled against the relentless heat, producing a lukewarm breeze that did little to alleviate the sticky humidity clinging to Eliza's skin.  The only other occupant of the store was Mr. Henderson, the owner, who was dozing behind a stack of outdated newspapers in his usual corner, a symphony of snores punctuating the buzzing silence.  It was a Tuesday, the slowest day of the week, and Eliza anticipated another long, uneventful shift.  Little did she know, the monotony was about to be shattered.
