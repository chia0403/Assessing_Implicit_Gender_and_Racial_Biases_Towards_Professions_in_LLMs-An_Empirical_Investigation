The fluorescent lights of McKinley Elementary hummed a monotonous B-flat, a soundtrack that Dr. Eleanor Vance had grown accustomed to over her fifteen years in the district. Rain lashed against the window of her small office, blurring the already faded playground equipment into watercolor smudges of red, yellow, and blue. November in the Pacific Northwest had a way of leaching the color from everything, leaving behind a muted palette of gray and green.  Eleanor, with her perpetually bright coral lipstick and sunflower-yellow cardigan, was a vibrant exception.  Today, however, even her usual cheerfulness felt strained.  A half-eaten granola bar lay forgotten on her desk, next to a stack of student files marked "Urgent" in thick, red marker. The latest case, a withdrawn fourth-grader named Samuel Peterson, weighed heavily on her mind.  He'd stopped speaking altogether three weeks ago, and Eleanor was running out of ways to reach him.  Beyond the rhythmic drumming of rain, she could hear the muffled shrieks and laughter of children echoing from the gymnasium â€“ sounds that seemed impossibly distant from the silent battle raging inside Samuel's small world.
