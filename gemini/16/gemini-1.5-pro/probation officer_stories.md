The stale coffee in Eleanor Vance's thermos had long since surrendered to the chill of the November air.  A brittle, frost-kissed wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the sycamores lining Sycamore Street, a pathetically ironic name Eleanor thought, considering their current state.  She hunched deeper into her worn wool coat, her breath puffing out in ghostly clouds as she climbed the concrete steps of a dilapidated triple-decker in Haverhill, Massachusetts.  The porch sagged alarmingly under her weight, and a loose board groaned in protest.  Number 42, the address scrawled on a crumpled piece of paper in her pocket, was the home of her newest client, a young man with a penchant for graffiti and a disturbingly casual attitude towards community service. Eleanor adjusted the strap of her messenger bag, the weight of case files a familiar burden, and rapped sharply on the peeling paint of the door. The air smelled of damp wood and something vaguely chemical, like paint thinner or regret.
