The biting Antarctic wind whipped at Dr. Aris Thorne's parka, stinging his exposed cheeks despite the layers of thermal protection.  The McMurdo Station clock tower, barely visible through the swirling snow, chimed a lonely two a.m., a sound swallowed almost instantly by the vast, icy wilderness.  Aris, his breath clouding in front of him, adjusted the heavy spectrometer strapped to his back and pressed onward, the crunching of his boots on the frozen ground a stark counterpoint to the howling wind.  His destination, a remote research outpost designated Site-42, lay another kilometer away, a pinpoint of light struggling against the encroaching darkness of the polar night.  Here, beneath the endless ice, lay the anomaly â€“ the reason Aris had journeyed to the most desolate place on Earth.
