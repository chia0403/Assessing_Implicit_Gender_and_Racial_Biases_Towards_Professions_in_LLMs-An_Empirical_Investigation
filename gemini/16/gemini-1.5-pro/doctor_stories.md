The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, rattling the windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's surgery.  Grey, turbulent waves crashed against the stone harbour walls of Port Blossom, a small, isolated fishing village nestled on the rugged Yorkshire coast. Inside, a single coal fire struggled to combat the pervasive chill that clung to the damp stone walls.  The air smelled faintly of antiseptic and the slightly sweeter, more cloying scent of the dried herbs hanging from the rafters. Elias, his brow furrowed in concentration, adjusted the flickering gas lamp above his worn oak desk, its light illuminating a scattering of medical texts and a half-written letter. Beyond the window, the last sliver of a bruised sunset bled into the darkening sky, casting long, skeletal shadows of the fishing boats moored in the harbour.  A storm was brewing, both outside and, Elias suspected, within the confines of this small, seemingly peaceful village.
