The stale, recirculated air of the Denver International Airport hummed around Amelia Grace Holloway, clinging to her like the scent of cheap coffee and desperation.  Outside, the late April Colorado sun beat down on the tarmac, reflecting off the wings of grounded planes with a blinding intensity.  Amelia tugged at the collar of her crisp white blouse, already wilting in the oppressive heat.  Her Samsonite, packed to the brim with sample jars of "MiracleShine" all-purpose cleaner, sat patiently at her feet, a silent testament to her optimism. This was her fourth sales trip this month, and so far, she'd landed precisely zero new accounts. If she didn't close a deal with Mountain Mart this week, her boss, the perpetually exasperated Mr. Henderson, had all but promised to "re-evaluate her role" within the company. And Amelia knew exactly what “re-evaluate” meant: unemployment.  She took a deep, fortifying breath of airport air (coffee and desperation be damned), plastered on her best "I-close-million-dollar-deals-before-breakfast" smile, and strode towards the baggage claim, her heels clicking a determined rhythm on the polished floor.  Mountain Mart, and the fate of her career, awaited.
