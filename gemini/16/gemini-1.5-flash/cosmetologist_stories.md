The scent of vanilla and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Aurelia "Rella" Davenport.  Rella, owner and sole operator of "Rella's Reflections," swiped a stray strand of fiery red hair from her cheek, the movement as practiced and graceful as the flick of a wrist applying mascara.  Her salon, nestled on a cobblestone side street in the quaint, perpetually autumnal town of Oakhaven, Vermont, was a charming mismatch of antique furniture and modern minimalist design.  A chipped porcelain doll with one missing eye sat perched on a shelf above a gleaming chrome hair-washing station, a silent observer to the dramas that unfolded daily within those four walls.  The rhythmic *snip, snip* of her shears punctuated the quiet hum of the antique clock ticking away in the corner, the only sounds besides the gentle crackle of the fireplace, battling the October chill that seeped in through the aged windowpanes.  Tonight, however, the usual peaceful atmosphere felt charged, pregnant with an unspoken tension Rella couldn't quite place.  A new client awaited, and something about their appointment feltâ€¦different.
