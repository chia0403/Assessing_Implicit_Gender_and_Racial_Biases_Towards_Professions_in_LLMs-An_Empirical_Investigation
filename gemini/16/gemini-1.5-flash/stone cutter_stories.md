The wind, a sculptor itself, whipped grit across the desolate plains of Alora, stinging Elias Thorne's weathered face.  Elias, a man whose hands were as rough and textured as the granite he shaped, squinted at the setting sun, its fiery hues mirroring the molten orange of the molten rock cooling in his makeshift kiln.  The kiln, a crude structure of mud bricks and scavenged iron, sat precariously close to the crumbling remains of a forgotten temple, its once-proud columns now little more than jagged, wind-worn stumps against the bruised purple sky.  The air hummed with the lonely cry of a desert hawk, a sound Elias had grown accustomed to over his forty years carving a life out of this unforgiving landscape.  His workshop, a scattering of tools and half-finished carvings nestled amongst the temple ruins, was as much a part of the desolate beauty as the wind-sculpted rock formations that dotted the horizon.
