The chipped paint of the “Welcome to Ms. Eleanor Vance’s Third Grade!” sign flaked onto the worn linoleum floor, mirroring the slow, steady disintegration of Eleanor Vance’s patience.  It was the last day before summer break, a day traditionally celebrated with chaotic glee by her twenty-five third graders, but this year felt different.  A thick, oppressive humidity hung in the air, clinging to the overstuffed classroom like a damp shroud.  The usual cacophony of children’s voices was muted, replaced by a low hum of restless energy that vibrated through the aging floorboards of Oakwood Elementary, a building that had seen better decades – and certainly, cooler days.  Sunlight, weak and watery after a week of relentless rain, slunk through the dusty windowpanes, illuminating swirling motes of dust dancing in the oppressive stillness.  Even the usually boisterous parakeet, Kevin, perched silently in his cage, his bright green feathers seeming dull and listless under the heavy summer air.  Ms. Vance sighed, the sound almost swallowed by the expectant hush of the room.  This wasn't just the end of the school year; it felt like the end of something else entirely.
