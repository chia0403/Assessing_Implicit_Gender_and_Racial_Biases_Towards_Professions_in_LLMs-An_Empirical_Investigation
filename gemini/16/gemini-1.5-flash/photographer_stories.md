The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face, a fine mist clinging to his beard and the damp canvas of his camera bag.  The wind, a relentless sculptor, whipped the grey Atlantic into a frenzy, churning the water into frothy whitecaps that clawed at the jagged rocks of the Aran Islands.  Inisheer, the smallest and westernmost of the three, was a stark, unforgiving beauty – a landscape carved by centuries of wind and wave, populated by stone walls that looked like the ribs of some ancient beast, and the scattered, tenacious homes of a dwindling population.  Elias, a photographer renowned for his moody seascapes and haunting portraits of forgotten places, shivered less from the cold and more from a deeper, unsettling unease that had settled over him since arriving on the island three days ago.  He adjusted the strap of his battered Leica, the cold metal a stark contrast to the warmth of his gloved hand, and squinted out at the churning sea, searching for the elusive light that would capture the island’s raw, untamed spirit.
