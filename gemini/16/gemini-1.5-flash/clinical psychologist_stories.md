The chipped paint of Dr. Eleanor Vance’s office chair flaked onto the worn Persian rug, a silent testament to the countless hours spent grappling with the anxieties and traumas of others.  Rain lashed against the tall, gothic windows of her practice, situated on the third floor of a crumbling Victorian building in the heart of Salem, Massachusetts.  The wind howled a mournful dirge through the gaps in the aged frames, a sound that, to Eleanor, felt strangely familiar, almost…sympathetic.  The scent of damp earth and decaying leaves mingled with the faint, persistent aroma of old books and brewing coffee, a comforting blend against the otherwise unsettling atmosphere.  Tonight, however, the usual comforting gloom felt heavier, pregnant with an unspoken dread that clung to the air like the persistent smell of woodsmoke after a long-burning fire.  Eleanor adjusted the antique brass lamp on her desk, its light barely piercing the encroaching darkness, and waited.  Her next patient was late.  Significantly late.
