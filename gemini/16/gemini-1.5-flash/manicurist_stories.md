The scent of acetone and lavender hung heavy in the air, a perfume as familiar to Seraphina "Sera" Moreau as her own skin.  Rain lashed against the oversized window of "Lacquer & Lore," her tiny nail salon nestled on a cobbled side street in the ancient, perpetually damp city of Prague.  Outside, the Charles Bridge groaned under the weight of the storm, its gothic spires barely visible through the driving sheets of rain.  Inside, however, Seraâ€™s world was a haven of controlled chaos.  Tiny glass bottles of vibrant polish lined shelves like miniature soldiers, while the gentle hum of a nail drill competed with the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of her nimble fingers against a client's perfectly oval nail.  Tonight, however, the usual soothing rhythm was punctuated by a nervous tremor in her hand, a tremor that had nothing to do with the electric file.  Something was wrong, profoundly wrong, and the lavender couldn't mask it.
