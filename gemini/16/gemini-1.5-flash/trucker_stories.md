The diesel engine coughed, a phlegmy groan that vibrated through the worn leather of Ezekiel "Zeke" Stone's seat.  Rain lashed against the windshield of his rig, a relentless drumming that mirrored the frantic beat of his own heart.  He gripped the steering wheel, its worn chrome cold beneath his calloused fingers, the wipers fighting a losing battle against the deluge.  Outside, the Texas panhandle stretched before him, a flat, unforgiving expanse swallowed by the deepening twilight.  The only visible landmarks were the skeletal silhouettes of wind-twisted mesquite trees, clawing at the bruised purple sky.  Zeke’s rig, a battered but beloved Kenworth he’d nicknamed "Betsy," was the only thing between him and the churning maelstrom of the storm.  The CB radio crackled with static, a lonely soundtrack to the desolate landscape.  His delivery was hours overdue, the cargo – a volatile shipment of experimental chemicals – growing more dangerous with every passing minute.  The storm, however, was the least of his worries.
