The chipped paint of the windowsill dug into Dr. Eleanor Vance's elbow as she stared out at the relentless grey November sky.  Rain, a fine, persistent drizzle, plastered the already sodden leaves of the ancient oak to its trunk, mimicking the way anxiety seemed to cling to the children she saw each day at Northwood High.

Cracked flagstones formed uneven pathways between the overgrown flowerbeds, each crack a miniature chasm mirroring the fissures that Dr. Vance spent her days trying to mend in the lives of her students.
