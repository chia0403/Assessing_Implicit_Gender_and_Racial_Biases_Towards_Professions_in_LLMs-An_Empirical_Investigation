The brass nameplate gleamed under the single, strategically placed spotlight:  *Aurelia “Reli”  Montclair, Concierge*.  Reli adjusted the silk scarf at her throat, the deep crimson a stark contrast to the cool, grey marble of the lobby in the opulent Blackwood Towers. Rain lashed against the vast panoramic windows, blurring the city lights into a shimmering, indistinct watercolour. Inside, however, the air hung thick with the scent of expensive potpourri and the low hum of quiet opulence. The only sound louder than the drumming rain was the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner, each chime a tiny hammer blow against the luxurious silence.  Tonight, however, the silence felt pregnant with expectation. Reli knew, with a certainty that settled deep in her bones, that this quiet night was about to explode.
