The scent of sandalwood and lavender hung heavy in the air, a comforting counterpoint to the relentless drumming of rain against the corrugated iron roof of Serenity Now Massage Therapy.  Inside, the flickering candlelight cast long, dancing shadows across the polished wooden floors, highlighting the dust motes swirling in the single beam of sunlight that pierced the gloom.  Amelia “Mia” Katherine Holloway, a woman whose hands possessed the magic of both soothing balm and insightful pressure, kneaded the tension from her own shoulders.  The storm outside mirrored the turmoil brewing within her, a far cry from the tranquil sanctuary she offered her clients.  Tonight, however,  Serenity Now felt anything but serene.
