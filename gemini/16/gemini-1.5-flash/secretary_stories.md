The chipped ceramic mug warmed Amelia Beatrice Hathawayâ€™s hands, a small comfort against the November chill that seeped through the drafty windows of Blackwood & Sons.  Rain lashed against the leaded panes, blurring the already indistinct cityscape of Victorian London.  Gaslight flickered, casting long, dancing shadows across the mahogany desk where Amelia sat, her fingers flying across the typewriter keys with practiced ease. The room, a cramped, cluttered annex tucked away in a shadowy corner of the sprawling law firm, smelled faintly of old paper, damp wool, and the ever-present aroma of burnt coffee from the perpetually sputtering office percolator.  Outside, the fog hung thick and heavy, a swirling, grey blanket muffling the sounds of the bustling city.  Inside, the silence was broken only by the rhythmic clatter of the typewriter and Amelia's own quiet sighs, the weight of unspoken anxieties clinging to her like the damp air.
