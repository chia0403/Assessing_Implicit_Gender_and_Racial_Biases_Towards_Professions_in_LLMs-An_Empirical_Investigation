The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face, a familiar kiss from the unforgiving Atlantic.  He gripped his worn wooden easel tighter, the wind threatening to topple it and send his half-finished canvas tumbling onto the jagged rocks below.  Below him, the churning grey sea met the bruised purple of the sky, a dramatic backdrop heâ€™d been struggling to capture for three days.  The wind howled a mournful dirge, a counterpoint to the frantic chirping of gulls overhead, as Elias squinted, attempting to reconcile the chaotic beauty before him with the sterile precision of his oils. He was perched precariously on a windswept cliff overlooking the tempestuous coastline of Cornwall, England, a place both inspiring and infuriating in equal measure.  The crumbling remains of a medieval watchtower, skeletal and stark against the churning sky, provided the only shelter from the relentless elements, and Elias, bundled in layers of wool, shivered despite himself.  He was determined, however, to finish this piece, to somehow translate the raw, untamed power of the storm onto his canvas before it broke him, both spiritually and physically.
