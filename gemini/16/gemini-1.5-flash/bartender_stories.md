The chipped Formica countertop felt cool against Elias Thorne's cheek as he rested his head, the dull throb behind his eyes a counterpoint to the rhythmic clinking of ice in glasses from the other side of the bar.  The air in "The Rusty Mug" hung thick with the scent of stale beer, spilled whiskey, and desperation – a familiar perfume to Elias, a scent he’d come to associate with the quiet hours between midnight and dawn. Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the dive bar, mirroring the storm brewing inside him.  Outside, the neon sign flickered intermittently, casting a sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked alleyway, where shadows stretched and writhed like restless spirits. The only other occupant of the bar, besides Elias, was a lone figure hunched in a booth, nursing a glass of something dark and probably potent. The clock on the wall ticked with infuriating slowness, each second an agonizing reminder of the night’s events, and the weight of a secret Elias couldn’t shake.
