The salt spray stung Aurelia Blackwoodâ€™s face, a familiar kiss from the unforgiving Atlantic.  She braced herself against the relentless wind, her easel shuddering on the craggy cliff edge overlooking the churning grey sea.  The sky, a bruised purple and angry orange, mirrored the tempest brewing within her.  Her palette, a chaotic mix of greys, blues, and angry crimson, reflected the turbulent scene before her, yet felt a poor substitute for the turmoil in her heart.  The wind howled a mournful song, a symphony of destruction that matched the wreckage of her recent life, a life she was desperately trying to capture, not on canvas, but in the raw, unforgiving beauty of the Cornish coast.  This remote, windswept corner of Porthcurno, a place of stark beauty and hidden coves, was her sanctuary, her refuge, and the only place where she felt she could begin to paint her way back to herself.
