The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of decaying mangoes and diesel fumes.  Cicadas buzzed a relentless, high-pitched symphony from the overgrown foliage that clawed at the crumbling walls of the abandoned hacienda.  Dust motes, illuminated by the harsh glare of the setting sun, danced in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom of the interior.  Isabelle “Izzy” Moreau, renowned director of gritty, neo-noir thrillers, wiped sweat from her brow, the dampness clinging to her already-sticky linen shirt.  The hacienda, once a symbol of opulent colonial wealth, now served as the dilapidated backdrop for her latest project, *The Serpent's Kiss*, a film she desperately hoped would resurrect her flagging career after the critical panning of her last, over-budget, and frankly, bizarre, sci-fi epic, *Galactic Garden Gnomes*.
