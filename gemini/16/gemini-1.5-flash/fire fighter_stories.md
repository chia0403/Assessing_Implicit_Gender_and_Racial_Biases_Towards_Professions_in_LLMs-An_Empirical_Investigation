Around her, the cacophony of crackling flames, the hiss of water against burning wood, and the grunts of her fellow firefighters battling the blaze formed a brutal symphony of destruction.  The isolated cabin, barely visible through the swirling smoke, stood on a lonely hillside overlooking the vast, whispering expanse of Blackwood Forest, its silence a chilling counterpoint to the chaos Evie and her crew were fighting to contain.
