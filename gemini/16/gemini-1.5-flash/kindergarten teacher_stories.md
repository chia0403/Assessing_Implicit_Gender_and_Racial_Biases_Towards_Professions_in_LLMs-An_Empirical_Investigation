The chipped paint of the "Welcome to Ms. Eleanor Vance's Classroom" sign flaked onto the worn welcome mat like a gentle, continuous snowfall.  Inside, Room 2B hummed with a pre-lunch chaos only a kindergarten classroom could produce.  Crayon shavings littered the brightly colored carpet, a miniature Jackson Pollock masterpiece in progress.  Tiny hands, sticky with glue and glitter, wrestled with construction paper dinosaurs, while the air thrummed with a cacophony of squeals, giggles, and the insistent, slightly off-key rendition of "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" emanating from the music corner.  Eleanor Vance, twenty-eight and already sporting a faint purple crayon smudge on her cheek, surveyed her kingdom with a mixture of exhaustion and affection.  The smell of peanut butter and impending naptime hung heavy in the air.
