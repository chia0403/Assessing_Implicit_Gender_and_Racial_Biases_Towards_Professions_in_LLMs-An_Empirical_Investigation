The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of Xylos, stinging Sergeant Valerius Thorne's cheeks raw.  His breath plumed out in frosty white clouds, momentarily obscuring the already dim light filtering through the perpetual twilight.  He hunched deeper into his thick, furs-lined cloak, the rough wool scratching against his worn leather jerkin.  Xylos was a land of perpetual dusk, a vast expanse of scrub and jagged, purple-tinged mountains, perpetually under the shadow of the Crimson Eclipse, a celestial phenomenon that had cursed the land for centuries.  Valerius, a man etched with the harsh lines of a life spent guarding the crumbling remnants of the old Empire, stood watch at the desolate outpost of Fort Solara, its weathered stones a testament to a forgotten glory. The only sound besides the wind was the occasional screech of a carrion bird circling high above.  The silence, however, was far more menacing than any sound.  It was a silence pregnant with an unseen threat, a silence Valerius knew all too well.
