The chipped porcelain of the apothecary jar felt cool beneath Elara Vance's fingertips.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single, flickering gas lamp above the counter of "Vance & Son Apothecary," danced in the still, night air.  Outside, the relentless November wind howled a mournful tune around the gothic eaves of the building, rattling the ancient windowpanes in their frames.  The scent of dried herbs, clinging stubbornly to the aged wooden shelves, mingled with the sharp, almost metallic tang of pennyroyal and the cloying sweetness of dried rose petals – a familiar perfume that had been a constant in Elara's life since she was a child, helping her father weigh and measure in this very shop. Tonight, however, the usual comforting aroma was tinged with something else… something unsettling, something akin to the metallic tang of blood.
