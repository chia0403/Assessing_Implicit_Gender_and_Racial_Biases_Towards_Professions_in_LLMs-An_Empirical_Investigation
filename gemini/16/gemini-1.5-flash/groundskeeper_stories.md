The biting November wind whipped across the manicured lawns of Blackwood Manor, tearing at Elias Thorne’s already threadbare coat.  Elias, a man whose life was measured in the rustling of fallen leaves and the steady drone of the lawnmower, hunched deeper into his worn wool, the collar scratching against his chapped neck. Blackwood Manor itself, a gothic behemoth of grey stone and ominous shadows, loomed above him like a disapproving gargoyle.  Its many windows, like vacant eyes, stared out across the sprawling grounds, reflecting the bruised purple of the twilight sky.  Tonight, however, the usual chill of the estate was amplified by something else, a prickling unease that settled deep in Elias’s bones, a feeling far colder than the relentless November wind.
