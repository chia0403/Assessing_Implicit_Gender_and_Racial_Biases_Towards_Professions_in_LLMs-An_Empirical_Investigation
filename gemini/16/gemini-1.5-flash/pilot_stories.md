The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful song around Captain Evelyn "Evie" Reed's battered Cessna 185, rattling the already fragile windows like skeletal fingers.  Below, the Chugach Mountains hunched like slumbering giants, their snow-capped peaks shrouded in a swirling veil of mist that clung to the jagged peaks and plunged into the deep, icy valleys.  The air, thin and frigid at this altitude, tasted of pine and impending snow.  Evie, her breath misting in the minuscule cockpit, wrestled with the controls, the plane bucking slightly against the unpredictable currents.  This wasn't just a flight; it was a fight against the unforgiving wilderness, a battle waged one icy gust at a time.  Her destination: a remote research station nestled precariously on the edge of a glacier, a place where even the most seasoned pilot hesitated to venture.  But Evie Reed wasn't one to shy away from a challenge.  The radio crackled to life, a static-laced voice breaking through the howling wind.  It was time.
