The biting wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vance’s auburn braid across her face as she wrestled the recalcitrant gate open.  Salt spray stung her cheeks, the taste sharp and metallic against the lingering scent of pine and damp earth.

The air vibrated with the mournful cry of gulls, a sound both desolate and strangely comforting in the wild, untamed beauty of the landscape.  Her Land Rover, a mud-caked veteran of countless rural callouts, groaned under the weight of its supplies – everything from a stethoscope and suture kit to a rather battered bag of carrots, intended, she hoped, to bribe a particularly stubborn Highland cow.  This was Skye, her home, her sanctuary, and today, the scene of another unpredictable veterinary emergency.
