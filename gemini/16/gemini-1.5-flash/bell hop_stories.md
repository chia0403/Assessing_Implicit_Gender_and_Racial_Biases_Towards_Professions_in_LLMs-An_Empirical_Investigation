The brass spittoon gleamed under the flickering gaslight, reflecting the grime-streaked grandeur of the Grand Majestic Hotel's lobby.  A faint scent of lavender and stale cigars hung in the air, a perfume as familiar to twenty-year-old Jasper "Jazz" Ellington as the rhythmic clang of the elevator doors.  Jazz, his starched white uniform crisp despite the humid Charleston night, polished a already-gleaming tray with practiced ease.  The ornate, gilded clock above the reception desk chimed eleven, a sound that usually signaled a lull in the evening's frantic energy, but tonight, a palpable tension hummed in the air, thick as the fog rolling in from the Cooper River.  The usual boisterous chatter of wealthy socialites and shady businessmen was replaced by a hushed, nervous whispering, punctuated by the occasional sharp intake of breath.  Something was amiss at the Grand Majestic, and Jazz, the keenest observer in the hotel, knew it.
