The biting November wind whipped across the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks lining the perimeter of Blackwood High’s football field, carrying with it the scent of damp earth and the faint, lingering aroma of burnt popcorn from Friday night’s game.  A solitary figure, hunched against the chill, paced the sidelines.  This wasn't the roar of the crowd he was used to; instead, only the mournful sigh of the wind answered his restless footsteps.  His name was Elias Thorne, and even though the season was officially over, the weight of defeat still pressed down on him like the heavy, sodden turf beneath his worn cleats.  He wasn't just any coach; he was the head football coach of Blackwood High, a position he'd held for the past fifteen years, a tenure marked by more triumphs than setbacks, until this disastrous season.  The field, usually a vibrant stage for his team's glory, now felt like a graveyard of broken dreams.
