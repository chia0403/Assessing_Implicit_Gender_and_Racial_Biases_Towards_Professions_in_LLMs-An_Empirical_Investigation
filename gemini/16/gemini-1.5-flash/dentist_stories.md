The humid Louisiana air hung heavy, thick with the scent of honeysuckle and simmering bayou.  Cicadas buzzed a relentless, hypnotic drone, a soundtrack to the oppressive stillness that clung to the sleepy town of Bay St. Louis.  Dr. Evelyn Evangeline Moreau, DDS, sat on the porch swing of her Victorian-era dental practice, the chipped paint of "Moreau Dental" barely clinging to the weathered wood.  A half-empty glass of sweet tea sat forgotten on the small table beside her, the ice melting sluggishly into a pool of amber liquid, mirroring the slow, deliberate drip, drip, drip of water from a leaky gutter above. The only sounds louder than the cicadas were the rhythmic creaks of the swing and the distant, mournful wail of a passing train â€“ a sound as familiar to her as the ache in her own aching back.  Tonight, however, the usual placid rhythm of her life was about to be violently disrupted.
