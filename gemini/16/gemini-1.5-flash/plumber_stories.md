The greasy wrench slipped in Finley "Finn" O'Malley's calloused hand, the metallic tang of pipe cleaner clinging to his fingers like a second skin.  Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the dilapidated Victorian house, a relentless drumming that mirrored the frantic beat of his own heart.  He was perched precariously on a crumbling section of attic floor, the only light source a single, flickering bulb dangling precariously above him, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to writhe with the ancient house itself.  The air hung thick with the scent of damp wood, dust motes, and something else… something faintly metallic and sickeningly sweet, a smell that had Finn’s gut churning more than the climb up the rickety stairs.  This wasn't just a clogged drain; this was Blackwood Manor, infamous throughout Oakhaven for its eccentric inhabitants, its unsettling history, and its notoriously stubborn plumbing.
