The recycled air hung thick and stale, a humid blanket clinging to Seraphina "Sera" Moreau as she navigated the dimly lit aisle of the nearly empty Boeing 747.  It was 3:17 AM, somewhere over the vast, inky expanse of the Pacific Ocean, the only illumination coming from the faint glow of the emergency exit signs and the rhythmic pulse of the engines, a low thrumming that vibrated through the floor and up into her bones.  Outside, the stars blazed, a breathtaking spectacle completely invisible to the handful of slumbering passengers tucked away in their cramped cocoons.  The scent of jet fuel and stale coffee lingered, a familiar perfume of her nocturnal existence, a stark contrast to the glamorous image plastered on the airline's promotional brochures.  Tonight, however, the glamour was absent, replaced by the quiet exhaustion that settled deep in Sera's weary bones after a grueling 14-hour flight from Hong Kong.
