The biting November wind whipped Amelia Katherine "Amy" Holloway's trench coat around her legs as she huddled deeper into the shadowed alcove. Rain, a relentless, icy drizzle, plastered her already damp hair to her scalp.  Across the cobbled street, the gargoyle-studded facade of Blackwood Manor loomed, a gothic behemoth silhouetted against the bruised purple of the twilight sky.  Its many windows, like vacant eyes, stared out at the deserted street, reflecting the flickering gas lamps in fragmented, unsettling glimmers.  Amy, a reporter for the *Edinburgh Chronicle*, shivered, not entirely from the cold.  The story she was chasing – the disappearance of Lord Blackwood's youngest daughter, Lady Eleanor – felt as chilling as the Edinburgh night itself.  The silence, broken only by the rhythmic slap of rain and the distant mournful wail of a siren, was thick with an unspoken dread, a palpable sense of something…wrong.
