The sterile scent of ozone hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Seraphina “Sera” Moreau.  It clung to her scrubs, to the polished chrome of the instruments neatly arranged on her tray, even to the worn leather of her comfortable, yet surprisingly stylish, clogs.  The rhythmic whir of the suction machine provided a constant, almost soothing, hum in the background, a counterpoint to the nervous chatter emanating from the waiting room of  "Bright Smiles Dentistry," a small, but impeccably clean, practice nestled on a quiet side street in the charming, if slightly dilapidated, coastal town of Seabrook, Maine.  Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the weathered clapboard houses, painting the scene in hues of ochre and rose, a stark contrast to the clinical brightness of Sera's operatory.  The salt spray from the nearby ocean carried a faint, briny tang, a smell that always reminded Sera of home, even amidst the predictable anxieties of another workday nearing its close.
