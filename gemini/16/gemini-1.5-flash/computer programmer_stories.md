The flickering neon sign of the "Lucky Dragon" noodle shop cast a lurid, orange glow across Elara Vance's rain-slicked shoulders.  Water streamed from the brim of her worn fedora, mirroring the cascading lines of code that still swam behind her eyelids.  Elara, a programmer whose caffeine intake rivaled that of a small espresso stand, hunched deeper into her threadbare coat, the chill wind a stark contrast to the feverish heat of the debugging session that had just concluded – a session that had stretched late into the rainy Tuesday night, fueled by instant ramen and the desperate hope of meeting a looming deadline.  The air hung thick with the scent of soy sauce and exhaust fumes, the city’s symphony of sirens and distant shouting a low hum beneath the rhythmic clatter of chopsticks from within the noodle shop. This wasn't exactly Silicon Valley; this was Chinatown, Seattle, and Elara Vance was far from home, both geographically and emotionally.
