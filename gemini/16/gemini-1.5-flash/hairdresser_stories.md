The scent of burnt sugar and rosemary hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume only Aurelia "Rel" Marigold could conjure.  Rel, with her riotously auburn hair piled high in a precarious tower that defied gravity, surveyed the chaos of her salon, "Shear Madness."  It wasn't the pristine, minimalist haven of a high-end salon; instead, it was a vibrant explosion of colour and texture, nestled incongruously between a dusty antique shop and a bakery that specialized in gloriously messy croissants.  Faded velvet armchairs, overflowing with brightly coloured yarn and stray hair clips, surrounded a mismatched collection of vintage styling stations.  The walls, painted a shocking turquoise, were adorned with mismatched mirrors, each reflecting a different, slightly warped version of the already eccentric space.  Outside, the relentless drizzle of a Seattle autumn hammered against the mismatched windowpanes.  Inside, however, a different kind of storm was brewing. Rel's most demanding client, Mrs. Gable, was late, and her usually immaculate perm was due to be restyled in precisely fifteen minutes.
