The biting November wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vance’s trench coat around her legs as she ascended the creaking steps of Blackwood Manor.  Rain, a relentless curtain of grey, plastered her dark hair to her scalp, clinging to the collar of her already damp coat.  Blackwood, a gothic monstrosity perched precariously on a windswept cliff overlooking the churning North Sea, was less a house and more a brooding testament to decaying grandeur.  Gargoyles, their stony faces eroded by centuries of salt spray and storms, leered down from the eaves, seeming to watch her every move.  Inside, the air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and something else…something metallic and faintly sickening, a scent that clung to the very bones of the place and tightened the knot already forming in Eleanor's stomach.  This was her third such case this year, each more disturbing than the last.  But Blackwood Manor held a particular… malevolence. A silence deeper than the storm raged within its walls, a silence Eleanor Vance, forensic psychologist and expert in the darkest corners of the human mind, knew she had to unravel.
