Instead, one of the supporting pillars, a delicate spun-sugar creation disguised as a twisted vine, had snapped, leaving the entire top tier precariously tilting, threatening to send a miniature bride and groom tumbling into a buttercream-frosted graveyard below.  The clock on the wall ticked with malevolent glee, each second a hammer blow to Amelia's already frayed nerves.  Outside, the relentless August sun beat down on the quaint cobblestone street of  Littleport, its heat mirrored by the inferno raging in Amelia's stomach.
