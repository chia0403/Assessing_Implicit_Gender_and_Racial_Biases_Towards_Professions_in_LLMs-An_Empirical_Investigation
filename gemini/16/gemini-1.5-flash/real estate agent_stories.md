The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum colour, bled across the manicured lawns of Willow Creek Estates.  A chill wind, carrying the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth, whipped Amelia “Mia” Kensington’s perfectly styled auburn bob across her face.

It wasn't the kind of quiet that whispered of peaceful suburban life; this was a silence pregnant with unspoken secrets, clinging to the perfectly-placed hydrangeas and the gleaming, almost too-perfect facades of the million-dollar homes lining the street.  Tonight, however, the charm of Willow Creek felt less like a picturesque postcard and more like a stage set waiting for a particularly unsettling play to begin.
