The salt spray stung Dr. Eleanor Vance's face as she wrestled the stubborn fishing net onto the small, battered boat.  The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum sinking towards the churning grey Atlantic, cast long shadows across the jagged rocks of the Maine coast.  Seabirds cried overhead, their mournful calls echoing the lonely rhythm of the waves crashing against the cliffs.  Her chiropractic clinic, "Vance Wellness," was miles away, a distant memory tucked neatly away in the quaint village of Port Blossom, a place currently overshadowed by the raw, untamed beauty and relentless chill of the outer islands.  Eleanor, normally clad in crisp, professional scrubs, was bundled in layers of wool and waterproof gear, her usually immaculate ponytail escaping its confines, whipped by the relentless wind.  The air smelled of brine, seaweed, and a faint, underlying scent of woodsmoke â€“ a comforting contrast to the pungent aroma of liniment that usually clung to her clothing.  This, she thought, bracing herself against another gust, was far from a typical Wednesday.
