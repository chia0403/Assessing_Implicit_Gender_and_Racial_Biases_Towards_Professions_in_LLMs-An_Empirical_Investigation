The salt spray stung Dr. Eleanor Vanceâ€™s face as she wrestled the stubborn fishing net from the barnacle-encrusted railing of the *Sea Serpent*.  The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum sinking below the jagged horizon of the Maine coast, cast long, skeletal shadows across the weathered wood.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and drying seaweed, carried the mournful cry of gulls overhead.  Eleanor, her sensible physiotherapy sneakers already soaked through,  grunted with exertion, her usually meticulously-styled auburn braid coming loose around her shoulders.  This wasn't exactly how she'd envisioned spending her Friday evening after a long week treating patients with chronic back pain, but then again,  "helping old Captain Silas untangle his fishing gear" wasn't exactly on her job description either.  But a promise made to a friend, especially one with a lifetime's worth of sea stories and a jar of surprisingly good homemade chowder, was a promise kept.
