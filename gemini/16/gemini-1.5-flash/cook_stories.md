The salt-laced wind whipped Amelia “Mel” Hawthorne’s apron around her legs as she wrestled a recalcitrant lobster onto the chopping board.  The air, thick with the smells of brine, seaweed, and woodsmoke, clung to everything – the rough-hewn wooden planks of the wharf, the brightly painted fishing boats bobbing gently in the harbour, and Mel herself.  She stood on the splintered edge of the quay in the tiny, windswept fishing village of Port Blossom, Maine, a place where the relentless rhythm of the tides dictated life as much as the beating of her own heart.  The sun, a pale disc sinking towards the Atlantic, cast long shadows across the cobbled streets, painting the already picturesque scene in hues of orange and purple. This was her domain, not just the bustling kitchen of "The Salty Siren" seafood restaurant, but the very essence of Port Blossom itself.
