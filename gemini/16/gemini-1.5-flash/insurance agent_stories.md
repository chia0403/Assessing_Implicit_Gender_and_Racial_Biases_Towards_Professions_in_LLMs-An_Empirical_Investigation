The chipped porcelain teacup trembled in Amelia Josephine Cartwright's hand, mirroring the tremor in her own stomach. Rain lashed against the warped windowpanes of her office, a rhythmic counterpoint to the frantic drumming of her fingers on the mahogany desk.  Amelia, or "Amy" as most clients (and only the clients who dared) called her, surveyed the scene with a practiced eye. Her office, nestled above a dusty antique shop on the cobbled, rain-slicked streets of  Port Blossom, Oregon, was a testament to both her professional success and her penchant for collecting things best left forgotten.  Dust motes danced in the weak afternoon light filtering through the grimy window, illuminating a chaotic tableau of overflowing file cabinets, half-finished models of ships in bottles, and a taxidermied squirrel inexplicably wearing a tiny top hat. The air hung heavy with the scent of damp wool and old paper, a perfume uniquely Port Blossom.  Today, however, the usual comforting scent of the eccentric was overshadowed by the pungent aroma of fear â€“ a fear that clung to the crumpled telegram clutched in Amy's other hand, a fear that spoke of a storm far more devastating than the one raging outside.
