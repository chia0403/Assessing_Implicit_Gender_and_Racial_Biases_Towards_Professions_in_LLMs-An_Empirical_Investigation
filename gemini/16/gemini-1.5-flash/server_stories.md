The chipped Formica tabletop felt sticky under Amelia Hernandez’s fingertips, a familiar texture in the otherwise sterile, harshly lit environment of "The Golden Spoon Diner."  Fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune above, their glare reflecting off the stainless steel counter where a lone, wilted carnation struggled in a cracked vase.  Rain lashed against the panoramic windows, blurring the already indistinct cityscape into a grey, watery smear.  Amelia, her nametag slightly askew, wiped down the table with a practiced hand, the rag barely making a dent in the sticky residue left behind by a particularly messy family of four. The air hung thick with the cloying sweetness of burnt coffee and the faint, lingering scent of frying bacon – a perfume she'd come to associate not with comfort, but with the relentless grind of another Tuesday night at The Golden Spoon.
