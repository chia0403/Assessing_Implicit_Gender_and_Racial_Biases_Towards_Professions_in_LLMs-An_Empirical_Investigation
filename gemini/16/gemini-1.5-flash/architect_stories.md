The biting November wind whipped Amelia Blackwood’s auburn hair across her face as she stood perched precariously on the scaffolding, the skeletal frame of the unfinished Blackwood Tower clawing at the bruised twilight sky.  Below, the city of Aethelburg sprawled like a carelessly tossed tapestry, its myriad lights twinkling like fallen stars against the inky canvas.  The air, thick with the smell of damp concrete and the distant tang of woodsmoke from the ancient timber-framed houses nestled in the valley below, carried the mournful wail of a distant siren – a counterpoint to the rhythmic clang of Amelia’s own hammer against steel.  This wasn't just any building; it was her legacy, her magnum opus, a testament to her late father’s ambitious designs, a breathtaking testament to modern architecture thrust into the heart of a city steeped in history.  And tonight, under the unforgiving gaze of the almost-full moon, it felt less like a triumph and more like a looming, unfinished sentence.
