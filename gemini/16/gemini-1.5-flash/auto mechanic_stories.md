The grease-stained overalls of Elias Thorne felt like a second skin, the scent of engine oil and burnt coffee a familiar perfume.  Elias, a man whose knuckles were perpetually black and whose hands moved with the practiced grace of a concert pianist across a complex engine, hunched over a battered Ford Mustang, its hood propped open like a gaping maw.  The setting sun cast long shadows across the cluttered workshop, "Thorne's Torque," its faded sign barely visible behind a haphazard stack of tires and discarded mufflers.  The air hung thick with the metallic tang of rust and the hum of a distant highway, a constant soundtrack to Elias's life spent wrestling with the internal combustion engine's temperamental soul. Tonight, however, the Mustang's defiance felt especially personal.  It wasn't just a balky carburetor; it was a challenge.  A challenge Elias Thorne, master mechanic and reluctant philosopher, intended to conquer before the last sliver of daylight vanished.
