The chipped Formica countertop, stained a dull beige from countless spilled coffees and lukewarm teas, felt like a physical manifestation of Amelia Kensington's anxieties.  Amelia Kensington, 32, travel agent extraordinaire (or so she told her overly-enthusiastic mother), stared at the itinerary spread across the worn, floral-patterned tablecloth.  Across from her, the chipped mug, a gift from her first ever overseas trip to Amsterdam, sat stubbornly empty.

The setting was Amelia's cramped, but oddly comforting, agency office.  Sunlight, filtered through dusty blinds, cast long shadows across the haphazard collection of travel brochures, maps, and half-eaten sandwiches.  A faint aroma of burnt sugar, a testament to her questionable attempts at baking, hung in the air.  The office was situated on a bustling side street in a small, overlooked town nestled in the English countryside.  Willow trees, their leaves a symphony of emerald and gold, swayed gently outside the window, their whispers a constant reminder of the seasons changing and the deadlines looming. Ameliaâ€™s small agency, "Wanderlust Whispers," thrived on recommendations and word of mouth; often outperforming the big travel agencies.  But lately, the whispers were less of excitement, more of worry.  Her latest client, a demanding businesswoman named Beatrice, had a specific, and arguably, impossible, itinerary in mind.
