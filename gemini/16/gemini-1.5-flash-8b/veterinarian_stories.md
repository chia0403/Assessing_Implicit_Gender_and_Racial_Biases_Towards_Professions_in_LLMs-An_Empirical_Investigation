The biting wind, a relentless symphony of icy whispers, clawed at Dr. Elara Nightingale's face as she stepped out of the battered, snow-caked veterinary clinic.  The small town of Whisperwind, nestled in the valley, clung precariously to the mountainside, its quaint houses swallowed by the encroaching winter.  Deep drifts had piled up against the clinic's weathered facade, almost obscuring the faded "Dr. Nightingale's Veterinary Clinic" sign.  For Elara, this wasn't just a practice; it was a lifeline for the valley's creatures, a sanctuary in the heart of the unforgiving wilderness.  This particular evening, however, felt different.  An unnerving stillness hung heavy in the air, punctuated only by the rhythmic crunch of her boots on the frozen ground.  A low, guttural growl, carried on the icy wind, emanated from the dense pine forest bordering the town.  The growl wasn't the familiar sound of a wild animal, but somethingâ€¦ disturbed. Something unnatural.  Elara tightened her grip on her worn leather satchel, a familiar knot of apprehension tightening in her stomach.  Tonight, the valley's secrets were stirring, and she, the quiet guardian of Whisperwind's fauna, was about to face them.
