The chipped porcelain sink, a faded robin's egg blue, reflected the fluorescent hum of the salon.  Sunlight, weak and filtered through the grime-coated windows, cast long, distorted shadows across the polished floors.  This was Amelia "Amy" Blackwood's sanctuary, her domain within the labyrinthine beauty emporium known as "Crimson Crescents."  Amy, a manicurist of remarkable precision and quiet intensity, meticulously filed a client's nail, the rhythmic scraping a counterpoint to the soft chatter and the clatter of manicuring tools.  A single, blood-red tulip, wilting slightly in a chipped ceramic vase, sat on the chipped Formica counter next to her.  The scent of artificial roses and stale coffee hung heavy in the air, a constant reminder of the quiet desperation that lurked just beneath the veneer of glamour.  It was a Tuesday afternoon, the kind of Tuesday that felt like an eternity stretched taut between Monday's grind and the promise of the weekend.
