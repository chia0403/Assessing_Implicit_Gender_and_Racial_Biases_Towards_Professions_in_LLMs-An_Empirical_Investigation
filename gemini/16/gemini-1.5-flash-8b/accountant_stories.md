The fluorescent lights of the accounting firm, "Numbers and Nuggets," hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia  Ashworth's meticulous work.  The air, thick with the scent of stale coffee and recycled paper, clung to her like a second skin.  Amelia, a meticulous accountant with a penchant for spreadsheets and precise calculations, stared at the line of figures stretching across her computer screen.  She was reviewing the quarterly financial statements for the prestigious Blackwood Estate Winery, a task that felt, as always, like a meticulous climb up a mountain of numbers.  Outside, the grey London sky mirrored the gloom settling over her.  Rain hammered against the windowpanes, mirroring the relentless pressure building inside her.  It had been a particularly brutal quarter, plagued by unexpected vineyard blight and a sudden downturn in the market.  Amelia felt the familiar weight of responsibility pressing down on her, a heavy cloak of expectation woven from numbers and deadlines. The clock on the wall ticked with a maddening regularity.  Another half-hour and she'd have to confront the looming meeting with Mr. Blackwood himself, a notoriously demanding man with a reputation for sharp words and even sharper business acumen.
