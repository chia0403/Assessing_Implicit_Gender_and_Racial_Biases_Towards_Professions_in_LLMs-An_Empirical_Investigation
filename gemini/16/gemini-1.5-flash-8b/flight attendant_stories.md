The fluorescent lights of the cockpit hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Amelia "Amy"  Delacroix's heart.  Outside, the sprawling metropolis of Neo-Kyoto, a city built on the shimmering banks of a reclaimed river, shrunk beneath the wings of the Star Wanderer 747.  Amy, her tailored uniform a crisp, forest-green against the muted metal of the cockpit, checked the final pre-flight checklist, her fingers tracing the familiar symbols with practiced ease.  She hadn't seen the sunrise yet, a fact she always seemed to miss now, these days. The city lights painted the clouds in shifting hues of orange and violet, as if the sky itself was a canvas for a constantly evolving art exhibit.  The Star Wanderer, a vessel both of breathtaking beauty and unsettling precision, was poised for departure.  This particular flight, however, felt different.  A knot of unease tightened in her stomach, a feeling as familiar as the scent of recycled air in the cabin.
