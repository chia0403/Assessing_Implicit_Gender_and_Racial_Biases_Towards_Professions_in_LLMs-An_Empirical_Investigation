The flickering fluorescent lights of the Zenith City Library cast long, skeletal shadows across the shelves, highlighting the dust motes dancing in the air.  Rain hammered against the corrugated steel roof, a relentless percussion that drowned out the quiet hum of the building's antiquated HVAC system.

The year was 2077, and Zenith City, a sprawling metropolis built on the ruins of a forgotten world, was a place where the echoes of history whispered louder than the cacophony of the present.  The library, a relic of a time when information was freely shared and knowledge was valued, stood as a solitary beacon of calm amid the urban chaos.
