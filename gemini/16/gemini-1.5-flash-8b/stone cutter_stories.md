The biting wind, a relentless claw, whipped across the jagged peaks of the Silvan Mountains, stinging Elara Stonehand's cheeks.  She hunched deeper into her worn leather jacket, the coarse wool offering little respite against the glacial air.  Sunlight, a fleeting visitor, struggled to pierce the swirling grey clouds, casting long, skeletal shadows across the valley.  Below, the village of Oakhaven, nestled amongst the ancient, moss-covered stones, looked like a collection of sleeping gnomes.  This was Elara's domain, the heart of the quarry, a place where stone whispered secrets in the wind and the echoes of hammers hammered into the very fabric of the mountains.

Elara, her name a testament to the trade, was a stone cutter of renown, though her reputation was whispered more than shouted.  She possessed a gift for seeing the spirit within the rough-hewn rock, the stories it held within its cold, dense heart.  Her nimble fingers, hardened from years of shaping and carving, could coax a perfect form from the most stubborn of stone. Today, however, the mountain held its breath, a palpable tension in the air, as if waiting for something – or someone – to break the spell. The wind carried a peculiar sound – a low, rhythmic scraping, growing steadily louder as it approached the heart of the quarry.
