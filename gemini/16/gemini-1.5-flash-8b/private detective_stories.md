The flickering neon sign of the "Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow on Amelia "Ace" Cartwright's rain-slicked trench coat.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, a familiar perfume in the back alleys of Port Blackwood.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless percussion that echoed the frantic rhythm in Ace's chest.  Port Blackwood, a sprawling metropolis built on the forgotten dreams of forgotten fortunes, was a city sculpted from shadows and whispered secrets.  Today, one of those secrets was threatening to drown her.

Ace, a private investigator with eyes as sharp as shards of obsidian and a mouth that could shut down a courtroom, leaned against the greasy counter of the Rusty Mug.  The chipped porcelain mug in her hand held lukewarm coffee, a pale imitation of the fierce elixir she craved. Across from her, a man named Silas Blackwood, his face etched with worry lines that mirrored the wrinkles of the city itself, nervously tapped his fingers on the worn wooden table.


Setting: Port Blackwood, a sprawling metropolis nestled on the jagged coast of a forgotten archipelago.  The city is a paradoxical blend of opulent mansions perched precariously on cliff edges overlooking the churning sea and dilapidated alleyways choked with discarded dreams.  Rain-slicked cobblestone streets wind through towering warehouses and decaying skyscrapers, the entire city reflecting a melancholic history of forgotten fortunes and buried secrets.  The air, thick with maritime salt and industrial grime, hummed with the constant thrum of unseen machinery.  This was a place where fortunes were made and lost in the blink of an eye, and Ace Cartwright was the one who unearthed the truth, however grim.
