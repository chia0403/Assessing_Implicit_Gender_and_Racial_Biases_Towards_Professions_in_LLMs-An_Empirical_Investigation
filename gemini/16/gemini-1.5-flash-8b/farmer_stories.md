The biting wind, a relentless prairie wolf, howled across the cracked earth of the Ozarks.  Dust devils danced across the parched fields, swirling like specters around the weathered farmhouse.  Barn swallows, their once vibrant blue-grey plumage now tinged with a dullness mirroring the landscape, huddled on the eaves, waiting for the storm they knew was coming.  This was not the bountiful spring Elias Thorne, of Thorneâ€™s Acres, remembered.  This was drought.  This was despair.

Elias Thorne, a man whose weathered hands had coaxed life from the stubborn Ozark soil for forty years, stared out the window, his gaze fixed on the receding horizon.  The sky, a bruised purple and bruised grey, reflected the turmoil within him.  His crops, once a vibrant tapestry of green, were now withered husks, a mockery of his painstaking efforts.  The once-fertile ground beneath his feet was a gasping, cracked mouth, begging for water that wouldn't come.  He ran a calloused finger across the cracked, parched earth of his hands, tracing the lines etched by years of toil.  A single, stubborn blade of wheat, defiant in its withered state, was the only sign of life in his entire field.
