The chipped Formica countertop gleamed under the fluorescent hum of the probation office, reflecting Sergeant Amelia “Amy” Blackwood’s weary face.

Her job, a delicate dance between hope and disappointment, felt more like a slow march towards the inevitable.  Her frustration was a tangible thing, almost a tangible presence in the room.  She felt it knotting in her stomach, tightening her jaw, and constricting her breathing. This time, she knew, things were different. This time, the stakes felt higher.
