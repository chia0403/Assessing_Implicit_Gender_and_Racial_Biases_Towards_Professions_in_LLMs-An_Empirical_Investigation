The fluorescent lights of the emergency room hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to the chaotic symphony of beeping machines and anguished cries.  Rain lashed against the windows of St. Jude's Hospital, mirroring the storm brewing inside Amelia  Katherine  Fairchild, a registered nurse with seven years under her belt.  Tonight, the storm was particularly violent.  The air, thick with the scent of antiseptic and fear, felt almost palpable. Amelia, a woman whose normally composed demeanor was now frayed at the edges, stared down at the chart of a young man, his chest rising and falling with shallow, ragged breaths.  He was the latest addition to the ever-growing roster of victims of the city's relentless winter.  Fractured ribs, internal bleeding, hypothermia â€“ all too familiar tales tonight.  Outside, the wind howled, a mournful dirge matching the desperate rhythm of the heart monitor beeping against the rhythmic thumping in Amelia's own ears.  Each patient a challenge, each story a wound that seemed to ripple outwards, affecting not only the patient but the healers as well.
