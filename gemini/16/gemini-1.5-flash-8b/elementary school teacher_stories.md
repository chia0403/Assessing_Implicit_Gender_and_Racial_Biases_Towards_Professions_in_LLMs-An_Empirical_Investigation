Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Miss Amelia Peabody's classroom, a relentless drumming that echoed the frantic rhythm of her thoughts.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and mildew, hung heavy in the small, sun-dappled room at Oakhaven Elementary.

Outside, the autumn leaves, once vibrant hues of crimson and gold, lay flattened and sodden on the overgrown playground, a stark contrast to the cheerful murals adorning the classroom walls â€“ murals that now seemed to mock her with their vibrant, hopeful colours. It was a Monday, the day before the annual "Fall Festival of Fun."  Amelia, a third-grade teacher with a perpetually tired smile and a heart overflowing with the desire to bring joy, felt utterly defeated.
