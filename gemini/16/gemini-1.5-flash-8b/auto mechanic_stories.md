The greasy smell of burnt oil clung to the air, a familiar blanket that draped over the flickering fluorescent lights of "Torque & Tune," a small garage nestled between a used bookstore and a bakery with a perpetually-long queue.  Rain hammered against the corrugated metal roof, mimicking the frantic rhythm of Jasper "Jax" Blackwood's wrench as it danced across the engine block.  Jax, a wiry man with calloused hands and eyes that held the wisdom of countless dismantled engines, cursed under his breath.  The 1978 Ford Bronco, affectionately nicknamed "Bronco Betty" by its owner, a flamboyant artist named Willow, was giving him fits.  The engine sputtered and coughed, its demise echoing the frustration simmering within Jax.

The setting was the quiet industrial heart of Oakhaven, a city perpetually caught between the grit of its past and the promise of its future.  Old brick buildings, their facades weathered by time, lined the streets alongside towering, modern skyscrapers.  This juxtaposition was perfectly mirrored in Torque & Tune; a small, almost forgotten gem within a vast metropolis.  Jax, with his patched leather jacket and perpetually rumpled clothes, was a relic himself, a man steeped in the mechanics of a bygone era yet clinging to the hopes of a future where even the oldest machines could find a second life.  The air hummed with the unspoken stories of the vehicles that had passed through these very walls, their mechanical dramas etched into the very fabric of the garage.
