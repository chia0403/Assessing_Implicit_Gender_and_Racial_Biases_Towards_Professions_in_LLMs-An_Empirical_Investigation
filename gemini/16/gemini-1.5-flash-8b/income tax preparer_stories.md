The fluorescent lights of the "Tax Relief Express" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Butterfield's relentless march through spreadsheets and tax codes.  Paper, crisp and white, piled precariously on her desk like a miniature avalanche.  Empty coffee cups, testament to the long hours, were scattered amongst the mountainous stacks.  The aroma of stale coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint scent of antiseptic from the hand sanitizer bottles strategically placed around the cramped office.

Amelia, a woman of twenty-eight years with tired eyes and a perpetually frazzled bun, was a tax preparer in the heart of bustling Chicago.  Her small office, tucked away on the third floor of a nondescript brick building on a side street near the River, was a microcosm of the city itself.  The relentless energy of Chicago, a city of ambition and opportunity, echoed in the frantic pace of the preparation season.  Outside, the city thrummed with life – the cacophony of honking taxis, chattering pedestrians, and the distant rumble of trains – a stark contrast to the quiet, focused desperation inside Amelia's tiny office.
