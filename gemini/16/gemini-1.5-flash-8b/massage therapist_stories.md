The flickering neon sign of "Serenity Spa" cast a sickly yellow glow across the rain-slicked street, barely illuminating the chipped paint of the building.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of lavender and something subtly metallic, a scent that clung to the air like a forgotten promise.  This was the domain of  Anya Petrova, a massage therapist who, more than most, understood the language of aching muscles and unspoken anxieties.  Her small, dimly lit treatment room, tucked away on the back of the spa, was her sanctuary, a place where the world outside faded into a muted hum.  Tonight, however, the hum was amplified, resonating with a particular tension that made Anyaâ€™s usually placid nature thrum with an unfamiliar energy.  A low thrum of something else, too, vibrated from the unseen world beyond, a rhythmic pulse that echoed in the hollow spaces of the building, seemingly part of the city itself. The city was a symphony of sounds that night, a symphony Anya was determined to ignore as she set about her work.
