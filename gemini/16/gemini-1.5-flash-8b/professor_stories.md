Professor Alistair Finch-Hartley, a man whose tweed jacket seemed perpetually dusted with the fine grey ash of forgotten lectures, stared out the rain-streaked window of his study.  The drizzle, a relentless curtain against the already dim afternoon light, mirrored the perpetual gloom that clung to the sprawling, ivy-covered manor house.  It had been a particularly unproductive week, filled with the same monotonous rhythm of grading papers, brewing weak tea, and wrestling with the cryptic notes of his late mentor, Professor Aris Thorne.  Thorne, a renowned archaeo-astronomer, had disappeared without a trace ten years prior, leaving behind a baffling collection of astronomical charts and enigmatic glyphs, which had become Alistairâ€™s obsession.

A forbidding silence pressed down upon the estate, broken only by the rhythmic drumming of rain on the slate roof and the occasional rustle of the ancient oaks that clawed at the sky.  Inside, the large library, filled with towering bookshelves packed with forgotten knowledge, felt suffocatingly still.  A palpable sense of mystery hung in the air, as thick as the fog that often rolled in from the valley below.  Each creak of the old house, each rustle of the wind-whipped leaves, seemed to whisper of secrets hidden deep within its shadowy corners.
