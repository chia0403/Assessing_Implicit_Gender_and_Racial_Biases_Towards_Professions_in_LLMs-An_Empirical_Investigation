The chipped Formica counter, stained a perpetual beige from spilled coffee and countless greys, reflected the fluorescent hum of the salon.  Sunlight, fractured and weak, slanted through the grimy window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air.  This was "The Gilded Shear," a place where time seemed to stretch and shrink at its own whim, a haven of quiet desperation for the residents of the forgotten corners of Willow Creek.  Behind the counter, Amelia Rose Blackwood, with her perpetually tangled auburn braid and eyes the colour of polished mahogany, meticulously snipped at a strand of unruly blonde.  The client, a woman named Mrs. Periwinkle, with a floral print dress that seemed to absorb the surrounding gloom,  sighed softly.  Amelia, lost in the rhythm of the scissors, didn't hear it.  Another Tuesday, another mundane haircut.  But today, a tremor of unease, as subtle as a shifting shadow, curled around Amelia's heart.  A tremor that whispered of secrets buried deep in the whispers of the wind whistling through the empty alleyways outside, and secrets that might, just might, be revealed with the next snip of her shears.
