Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the rehabilitation centre, mimicking the relentless beat of Amelia "Amy" Carter's heart.  The air, thick with the scent of antiseptic and damp earth, hung heavy in the small, windowless physiotherapy room.  Sunlight, fractured and muted by the downpour, barely pierced the gloom.  This was the fourth Tuesday in a row Amy had been stuck in this room, trying to coax movement from a patient whose spirit seemed as withered as the autumn leaves spiraling down outside.  The room itself felt cold, not just from the encroaching chill, but from the palpable sense of despair that clung to the chipped paint and faded posters illustrating proper posture.


Amelia Carter, Occupational Therapist at the Blackwood Rehabilitation Centre, stared down at the patient, a sixty-year-old woman named Elsie, whose skeletal fingers trembled as she attempted to grip a lightweight exercise ball. The rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the rain against the roof was the only sound that broke the silence, a metronome keeping time with the slow, arduous process of recovery.
