The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow over Amelia Petrova, illuminating the dust motes dancing in the stale air.

Amelia, a small tornado of a woman with perpetually tired eyes and a perpetually stained apron, was caught in the maelstrom.  Orders were flying, complaints were escalating, and the smell of burnt coffee hung heavy in the air, almost tangible.  Her fingers, already sore from endless trips to the back room, were beginning to tremble. Tonight, something felt profoundly wrong.
