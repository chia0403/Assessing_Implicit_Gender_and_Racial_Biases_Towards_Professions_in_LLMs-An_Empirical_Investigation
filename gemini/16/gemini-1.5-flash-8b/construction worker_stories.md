The biting wind whipped Amelia "Anya" Petrova's hard hat around her head, nearly snatching the thermos of lukewarm coffee from her grasp.  The skeletal frame of the skyscraper, a jagged, steel-grey monument against the bruised purple sky, loomed before her.  Dust motes danced in the meagre light, illuminating the intricate network of scaffolding and metal beams that snaked like a monstrous spiderweb across the construction site.  This was her world, a world of concrete and steel, of dawn-to-dusk graft, of the acrid smell of welding fumes and the constant, rhythmic clang of machinery.  The city, a sprawling metropolis of glass and chrome, buzzed and hummed below, an indifferent backdrop to her daily struggle.  It was October, and the air hung thick with the promise of winter.  Below, the sounds of the city were a distant chorus; above, the wind howled a lonely tune.  Anya stared out at the vista, a flicker of weariness in her usually steely blue eyes.  She was nearly halfway up the 87th floor, the very tip of the spire barely visible, a tiny golden cross at the apex.
