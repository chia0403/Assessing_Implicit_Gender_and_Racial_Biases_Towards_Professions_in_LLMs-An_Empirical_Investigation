The fluorescent lights of the "Smile Station" hummed, a relentless counterpoint to the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Amelia  "Amy"  Abernathy's instruments against enamel.  The scent of antiseptic, strangely mingled with the faint, cloying sweetness of bubble gum, hung heavy in the air.  It was a Tuesday, 2:15 PM, and Amy, her reflection a blurry ghost in the polished chrome of the examination chair, meticulously polished a patient's molars.  Outside, the city thrummed with a symphony of honking cars and hurried footsteps.  Inside, the dental office, a small, somewhat cramped space in a bustling section of the city, felt like a haven of quiet efficiency, a temporary escape from the urban cacophony.  Her patient, a nervous teenager named Leo, fidgeted in his chair, occasionally shooting nervous glances at Amy from under the shadow of his oversized headphones.  The low hum of the dental equipment provided a cover for the sounds of  Leo's  muttering, a quiet, nervous undercurrent to Amy's focused movements.
