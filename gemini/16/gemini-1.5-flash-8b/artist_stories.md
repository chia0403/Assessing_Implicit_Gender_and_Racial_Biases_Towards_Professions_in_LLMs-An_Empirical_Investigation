The biting November wind, a relentless sculptor, carved icy patterns across the frosted panes of Amelia Blackwood's studio.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of linseed oil and burnt sugar.  Amelia Blackwood, a young woman with eyes the colour of storm clouds and hair the texture of spun moonlight, hunched over a canvas, a palette knife clutched in her hand like a weapon.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight piercing the gloom, illuminating the swirling vortex of blues and greys that comprised her latest creation â€“ a landscape of fractured memory, perhaps, or a fractured reality.  The studio, nestled within the crumbling stone walls of Blackwood Manor, was a testament to both her passion and her solitude.  High vaulted ceilings, once echoing with the laughter of generations, now echoed only with the rhythmic scrape of her brush and the crackle of the dying fire in the hearth.  Each chipped brick, each weathered beam, seemed to whisper tales of forgotten glories and whispered secrets, stories that Amelia, the chronicler of the manor's past, was desperate to capture on her canvas.  The wind howled outside, a mournful symphony mirroring the turmoil within her.
