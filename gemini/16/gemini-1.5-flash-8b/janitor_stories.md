The flickering fluorescent lights of the Grand Zenith Library hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the silent rustle of pages and the occasional cough.  Dust motes danced in the pale rays, illuminating the intricate carvings on the mahogany library tables, a stark contrast to the grime clinging to the worn, linoleum floor.  This was the domain of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, senior janitor, and tonight, the library was his.  Usually, the echoing quiet was comforting. Tonight, it was unnerving.

The setting was the Grand Zenith Library, a sprawling monument to knowledge, renowned for its towering, book-lined shelves reaching lost horizons, its ornate, ancient architecture, and, most notoriously, its peculiar tendency to house unsettling whispers and forgotten stories. Built in the early 19th century, it had witnessed countless generations of readers, scholars, and librarians.  But something, Barty felt, was different tonight.  The air seemed heavier, the silence more profound, the stillness somehow more menacing. A thin layer of frost clung to the windows, mirroring the chill that had settled deep in Barty's bones.
