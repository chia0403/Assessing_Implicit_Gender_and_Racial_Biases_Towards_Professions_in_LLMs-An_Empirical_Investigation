The aroma of lavender and sugared almonds hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint scent of burnt sugar that stubbornly clung to Amelia Butterfield’s apron.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom of her tiny bakery, “Sweet Surrender,” nestled between a secondhand bookstore and a bustling flower shop on the cobbled side street.  Rain hammered against the chipped terracotta roof, a relentless percussion that echoed the frantic rhythm of Amelia's heart.  She was late.  Hugely late.  And not just late for the afternoon rush;  she was late for a deadline that could shatter her dream.

Amelia, a wisp of a woman with eyes the color of warm caramel and hands perpetually stained a delicate shade of buttercream pink, meticulously piped a delicate rose onto a three-tiered cake.  Each petal, a tiny masterpiece of spun sugar, seemed to hold her breath, a tiny reflection of her own.  This cake, commissioned by the esteemed Lady Beatrice Blackwood, was no ordinary order.  It was the centerpiece for the Blackwood family's annual gala, a prestigious event that dictated social standing and was meticulously planned for months.  And Amelia, despite her best efforts to achieve a calm demeanor, felt a knot of anxiety tightening in her stomach.
