Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the Nightingale Clinic, a relentless drumming that echoed the frantic pulse thrumming in Dr. Elara Vance's ears.  The clinic, perched precariously on the edge of the windswept coastal town of Abernathy, was a testament to pragmatism rather than aesthetics.

The flickering fluorescent lights cast long, dancing shadows across the sterile waiting room, highlighting the worried faces of the handful of patients huddled within.  One, a young woman clutching a small child, trembled visibly, her face pale and etched with fear. The familiar scent of ozone, a prelude to the inevitable rush of trauma, mingled with the damp earth and salt.
