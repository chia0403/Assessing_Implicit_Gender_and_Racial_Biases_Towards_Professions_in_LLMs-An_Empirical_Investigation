The biting wind, a relentless wolf howlin' across the skeletal branches of the ancient pines, whipped at Silas Blackwood's weathered face.  He squinted, his gaze tracing the snaking emerald ribbon of the Elk River, a ribbon that held the promise of both life and death in these unforgiving, snow-dusted peaks of the Appalachian wilderness.  The year was 1898.  Silas, a logger with hands like knotted oak and eyes the color of a stormy sea, stood on the precipice of a new logging season, a season that smelled of pine tar, damp earth, and the ever-present threat of the untamed forest.  His lean frame, framed by a worn leather jacket and stained denim trousers, was braced against the icy blast, yet a sense of foreboding, deeper than the biting wind, settled over him.  He'd been haunted by the same grim premonition for weeks â€“ a feeling of impending doom that clung to the air like the mist hanging low over the valley.  The forest, which Silas had worked within and thrived upon, felt different, more agitated than usual. And that worried him.  He knew the forest. This time, the forest felt different, and that was terrifying.
