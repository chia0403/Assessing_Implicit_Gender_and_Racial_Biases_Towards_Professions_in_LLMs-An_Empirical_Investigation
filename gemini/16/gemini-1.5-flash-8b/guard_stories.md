The biting wind howled a mournful dirge against the grey stone walls of the Citadel of Eldoria, whipping icy shards of snow across the cobbled courtyard.  Seraphina Blackwood, her breath clouding the frigid air, tightened the grip on her worn leather gauntlet.  The flickering torchlight cast long, dancing shadows that seemed to mock the encroaching darkness.  It was the hour of the Watch, the quiet, perilous hour between dusk and dawn, when the shadows whispered and the unseen dangers lurked.  Seraphina, a Guard of the Citadel, stood sentinel at the northern gate, her breath catching in her throat with each gust of wind.  The citadel, a massive fortress carved from the heart of a jagged mountain, seemed to absorb the chill of the night, making her feel even more isolated.  Around her, the walls, stark and imposing, reflected the oppressive silence of the desolate landscape, broken only by the rhythmic creaking of the wind-battered gate.  A chill deeper than the cold seeped into her bones â€“ a chill of duty, of responsibility, of the unspoken horrors that lurked beyond the walls.  The gate, heavy and ancient, was her sole link to the world outside, a world shrouded in mist and the silent promise of something unknown.
