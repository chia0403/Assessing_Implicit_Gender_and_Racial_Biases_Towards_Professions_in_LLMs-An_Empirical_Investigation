The chipped paint of the workshop door, a faded teal, scraped against Elias Thornewood's calloused fingers as he pushed it open.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom, illuminating splinters of wood scattered like fallen stars across the floor.  Elias Thornewood, carpenter by trade, craftsman by soul, inhaled the familiar scent of sawdust and linseed oil, a comforting aroma that clung to the air like a second skin.  This was his sanctuary, his kingdom carved from the very heart of the old Victorian house that stood sentinel on the edge of Blackwood Hollow.  Rain hammered against the aged shingles, a rhythmic counterpoint to the quiet hum of his thoughts.  He'd been working on the intricate joinery of a custom-built bookcase for a week, a project commissioned by the enigmatic Mrs. Ainsworth, a woman whispered about in hushed tones in the Blackwood Hollow coffee shop.  Each piece of the oak, each perfectly-aligned groove, each delicate dovetail, seemed to resonate with the quiet drama of the place.  Blackwood Hollow, a village steeped in secrets and shadowed by ancient oaks, clung to its mysteries as tightly as the old house to the earth.  Elias felt the pull of its stories, both the known and the unknown, as strong as the gravity holding the wood together in his hands.
