The fluorescent lights of the executive boardroom hummed, a monotonous counterpoint to the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Amelia Blackwoodâ€™s fingers on the polished mahogany table.  Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of the penthouse suite, blurring the cityscape into a hazy grey watercolor.  London, a city of contrasts, was mirroring the internal turmoil within her.  Amelia Blackwood, Head of Global Operations for ZenithCorp, was staring at the meticulously crafted presentation, a masterpiece of graphs and charts that nonetheless felt like a dam about to burst.  The projected losses for Q3 were staggering, an avalanche threatening to bury the entire company under a mountain of red ink.

The setting: Amelia Blackwood's lavish, yet sterile, penthouse office suite in a towering skyscraper overlooking the perpetually rain-soaked cityscape of London.  The air crackled with unspoken anxieties and the hushed, professional whispers of her assembled board members, all acutely aware of the company's perilous position.  Beyond the enormous windows, the storm raged, a mirroring reflection of the brewing storm within ZenithCorp.
