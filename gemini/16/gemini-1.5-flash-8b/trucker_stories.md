The biting wind whipped across the desolate expanse of the Nebraska plains, stinging Amelia "Ace"  Harding's cheeks and rattling the windows of her rig, the "Iron Horse."  Dust devils danced across the cracked earth, swirling into miniature tornadoes that momentarily obscured the already fading light.  Ace, her calloused hands gripping the worn steering wheel, felt a familiar tremor of loneliness, a constant companion on these endless stretches of highway.  The air, thick with the smell of diesel and parched earth, felt heavier than usual.  Today, the interstate held the promise of more than just miles; it held the possibility of a confrontation, a confrontation she’d been dreading since she received the cryptic message.

The setting:  Late afternoon, a desolate stretch of Interstate 80, somewhere in central Nebraska, just before the town of Valentine.  The landscape was a stark canvas of brown and gray, with the occasional scraggly patch of grass clinging to survival. The horizon was a muted blend of fading orange and purple, casting long, skeletal shadows across the parched land.  The rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the truck’s engine was the only sound, punctuated occasionally by the distant howl of a coyote or the metallic screech of a hawk circling high above.  The "Iron Horse," a rumbling behemoth of steel and chrome, was more than just a vehicle; it was Ace's sanctuary, her home on the road. Inside, the cab smelled faintly of coffee and worn leather.  A flickering fluorescent light cast uneven shadows on the cracked dashboard, highlighting the myriad of faded maps and crumpled receipts scattered across it.  Ace's weathered face, framed by dark hair pulled back in a tight braid, reflected the vastness of the open road, a silent witness to the silent journey ahead.
