Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of the Blackwood Institute, blurring the already muted cityscape of Greyhaven.  Dr.  Eleanor Vance, a forensic psychologist with a reputation as sharp as her intellect, stared out at the deluge.  The rhythmic drumming against glass mirrored the frantic rhythm in her own head.  The case of the “Whisperer” – a serial killer who left only fragmented, disturbingly poetic messages at the scenes of his crimes – had consumed her for weeks.  Each clue, each chillingly precise detail, was a whisper in the wind, a voice lost in the roar of the storm.  The institute, perched atop a craggy hill overlooking the sprawling concrete jungle, felt isolated, even more so in this tempestuous evening.


The Blackwood Institute, a sprawling, neo-Gothic structure nestled between the towering skyscrapers and the endless expanse of Greyhaven’s industrial zone, was a haven for the city's most troubled minds.  Its muted grey stone walls seemed to absorb the city’s relentless energy, while its intricate, almost labyrinthine corridors concealed the secrets of countless troubled individuals.  Within these hushed halls, where shadows danced with the muted fluorescent lights, Dr. Vance navigated the maze of psychological assessments, forensic reports, and hushed conversations. The musty scent of old leather and aged paper, a familiar comfort, mingled with the metallic tang of fear that clung to the very air. Each room, filled with rows of cluttered desks and silent observation cells, whispered tales of shattered lives and broken promises.  The city itself, with its cacophony of sirens and the hushed desperation that clung to the air of Greyhaven's underbelly, seemed to bleed into the Institute's walls.
