The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Hawthorne's hands, a meagre comfort against the biting November wind that whistled through the gaps in the boarded-up windows of "The Ledger."  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight piercing the gloom of the tiny accounting office.  Amelia, a woman of thirty-two with eyes the colour of faded ink and hair the shade of a stormy sea, meticulously balanced a ledger.  The worn leather bound book, its pages filled with indecipherable scribbles and faded ink, represented the lifeblood of "The Wandering Star" – a struggling antique shop nestled amongst the towering brick buildings of the industrial district.  Her job, bookkeeper and confidante to Mrs. Eleanor Vance, the shop’s eccentric owner, was more than just balancing figures; it was a chronicle of the shop’s heart, its treasures, and the whispered stories of the past.  Today, the relentless tapping of the typewriter in the adjoining room was punctuated by the clatter of falling objects, a familiar symphony that usually preceded Mrs. Vance's pronouncements on the current state of her shop's inventory.
