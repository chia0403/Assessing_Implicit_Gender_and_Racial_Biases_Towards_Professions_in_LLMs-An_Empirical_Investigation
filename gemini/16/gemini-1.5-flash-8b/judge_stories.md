The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the cobblestones of Fleet Street, London, 1888.  Rain, a relentless, icy curtain, hammered against the arched windows of the Old Bailey courthouse, echoing the tempest brewing within its walls.  Inside,  Judge Bartholomew "Barty"  Fitzwilliam, his face etched with the weariness of a thousand trials, tapped a weary finger against the polished mahogany of his desk.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale ink and fear, a perfume familiar to him.  His silk robe, usually a comforting weight, felt like lead tonight.  Outside, the city, a symphony of grinding carriages and desperate whispers, was lost to the echoing thud of the relentless rain and the rhythmic click of the courtroom's grand clock.
