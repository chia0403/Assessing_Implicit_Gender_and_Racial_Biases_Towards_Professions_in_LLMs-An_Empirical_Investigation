The fluorescent lights of the Stellaris Institute hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic whir of the particle accelerator humming in the bowels of the facility.  Dr. Aris Thorne, a research scientist specializing in astroparticle physics, hunched over a sprawling holographic projection of a galaxy cluster.  His brow was furrowed, his fingers tracing the shimmering nebulae with a practiced, almost frantic, precision.  The year was 2242.  The Stellaris Institute, nestled deep within the vast, mountain-locked research complex of the New Colorado Plateau, was the world's foremost center for studying the enigmatic nature of dark matter.  Aris, gaunt and perpetually sleep-deprived,  had devoted his life to unraveling its mysteries, spending countless hours immersed in this cavernous research environment, the only constant companions the faint glow of the displays and the measured, almost solemn, clicks of his specialized equipment.  He felt a sudden, cold shiver, not from the air conditioning, but from a knot of unease tightening in his gut.
