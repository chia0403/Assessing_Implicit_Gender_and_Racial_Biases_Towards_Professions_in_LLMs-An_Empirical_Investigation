The biting wind whipped Amelia Grayson's hair across her face as she adjusted the straps of her worn-but-reliable fleece jacket.  The snow, a relentless, swirling white curtain, obscured the already-dim Appalachian mountain vista.  Below, the small, isolated town of Oakhaven nestled in the valley, a cluster of darkened houses clinging to the hillside like weary sheep.  Amelia, Physical Therapist, shivered, not just from the cold but from a profound unease that settled deep in her bones.  This was her third winter in Oakhaven, and each one seemed colder, not just in temperature but in spirit.  The silence of the mountains, usually a comforting balm, pressed down on her now like a suffocating blanket.  A thick fog, a ghostly shroud, hung low, obscuring the familiar silhouettes of the distant peaks.  Today, the fog felt particularly heavy, almost sentient, and it clung to her like a second skin.
