The pre-dawn chill clung to the asphalt like a damp shroud.  Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez, her name barely a whisper against the biting wind, squinted at the fractured concrete stretching before her.  I-95, a ribbon of grey under the bruised, purple sky, snaked its way through the desolate landscape of the New Jersey Meadowlands.  The air, thick with the scent of diesel fumes and damp earth, carried the faint, metallic tang of something akin to blood, a reminder of the dangers inherent in this early-morning vigil.  Amy, a highway maintenance worker for the New Jersey Department of Transportation, was already halfway into her shift, the familiar rhythm of her routine – inspecting, patching, and re-allocating – settling over her like a comforting blanket.  But today, something felt off.  Not broken, not wrong, just…different.  The silence, usually punctuated by the distant rumble of trucks, was unnervingly quiet.  And the flickering, almost hypnotic light of the sodium vapor lamps cast long, distorted shadows that danced and writhed around her like unseen figures. This section of the highway had been plagued by accidents lately, a relentless string of near-misses and shattered dreams.  Amy knew the area intimately, and it was not just the concrete that was damaged tonight.  It was the land itself, the silence, and the chilling feeling that something was amiss.
