Rain lashed against the arched windows of Amelia "Em" Davies's antique shop, a rhythmic drumming that echoed the frantic pace of her thoughts.  The shop, tucked away on a cobbled street in the heart of the perpetually overcast city of Aethelgard, was a kaleidoscope of colours and textures – a chaotic symphony of velvet, wrought iron, and chipped porcelain.  Em, a whirlwind of auburn curls and restless energy, paced between stacks of dusty furniture, each hurried stride punctuated by the clatter of falling trinkets.  A deadline loomed, a client demanding a transformation, and Em felt the familiar pressure tightening around her chest.  The commission, a sprawling estate on the outskirts of town, held the promise of both immense reward and potential disaster.  It was a sprawling, Gothic-style mansion, known locally as Blackwood Manor, and Em knew the rumours surrounding its dark past.   One thing was certain – the house itself held a story, and Em, the interior decorator, was about to become a part of it.
