The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine and impending rain.  Amelia Genevieve Cartwright, a nutritionist with a perpetually worried frown etched into her brow despite her meticulously sculpted eyebrows, surveyed the bustling market.  Vibrant colours clashed and jostled: scarlet peppers vying for attention with emerald greens, towering stacks of mangoes shimmering under the midday sun.  The air crackled with the cacophony of bartering voices, the rhythmic clatter of vendors' stalls, and the insistent chirping of unseen birds.  Amelia, though an expert in the nutritional value of every fruit and vegetable before her, felt a knot of unease tighten in her stomach.  She was in the bustling markets of Marrakech, Morocco, on a mission, not a vacation.

The setting:  The vibrant, chaotic Djemaa el-Fna square, at its peak midday bustle in the heart of Marrakech.  The aroma, sounds, and sights, while seemingly overwhelming, were crucial to Amelia's work.  It was here, amid the sensory overload, that she hoped to uncover the secrets behind a growing epidemic of nutrient deficiencies in the surrounding villages.
