The fluorescent lights of the drafting room hummed, a constant, low drone that vibrated through Amelia Blackwood's tired bones.  Dust motes danced in the pale oblongs of light, mimicking the erratic flight of the blueprints scattered across her drafting table.  Lines of meticulously drawn houses, factories, and fantastical structures –  all visions of tomorrow, all destined to be realized or forgotten based on the judgment of others.  Amelia, a drafting worker for the sprawling, grey-stoned firm of Abernathy & Sons, stared at the latest design – a sprawling, bio-dome hotel, its complex diagrams almost mocking her fatigue.  It was Wednesday.  Another day, another stack of demanding projects, and another looming deadline.  The air in the drafting room smelled faintly of stale coffee and something akin to burnt ambition.

The setting was the cramped, windowless drafting room of Abernathy & Sons, nestled within the bustling, yet somehow still melancholic, city of Ashwood. The air was thick with the scent of old paper and the faint metallic tang of the instruments Amelia so diligently used.  Rows of identical drafting tables, each a small island of chaos, lined the room.  The subdued light and the relentless clatter of the mechanical pencils against paper added to the pervading sense of quiet desperation.  Across the room, old Mr. Grimshaw, the head draftsman, hunched over his own complex renderings, a weathered hand tracing the lines of a skyscraper model with the precision of a surgeon.  Amelia's frustration was a tangible entity in the small, echoing space.
