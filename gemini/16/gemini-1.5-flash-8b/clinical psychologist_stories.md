Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, mirroring the tempest brewing within her.  The muted grey light of a late autumn afternoon painted the room in shades of melancholy, a fitting backdrop for the anxieties swirling around her.  Empty coffee cups and scattered papers testified to a long day spent navigating the complexities of the human psyche.  Eleanor Vance, a clinical psychologist specializing in trauma recovery, sat hunched over a file labeled "Case:  Alistair Blackwood."  

The office itself was on the top floor of a decaying, but imposing, Victorian building in the heart of the city’s historic district.  Cobblestones crunched under the feet of passersby below, their hurried steps a stark contrast to the slow, deliberate rhythm of her thoughts.  Dust motes danced in the shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom, illuminating a worn, antique desk littered with the paraphernalia of her profession – a well-worn copy of Jung's "The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious," a half-empty bottle of chamomile tea, and a stack of medical journals.  The scent of old paper and damp earth clung to the air, mingling with the faint aroma of lavender from a small, neglected herb garden tucked into a corner of her balcony, barely visible from inside the office.  The city, a restless symphony of sirens and distant traffic, offered a constant reminder of the world beyond her small sanctuary.
