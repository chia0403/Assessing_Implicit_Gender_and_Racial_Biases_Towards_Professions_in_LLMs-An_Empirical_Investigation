The chipped porcelain sink of the Grand Astoria Hotel, a monument to faded grandeur, reflected the flickering gaslight above.  Rain hammered against the ornate awning, a relentless percussion that echoed the frantic rhythm of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's heart.  Barty, a bell hop with eyes the colour of stormy seas and a perpetually rumpled uniform, meticulously polished a tarnished brass tray.  Not for any inherent love of shine, but because the rhythmic scrape of the cloth against metal was the only sound that could mask the cacophony of anxiety swirling within him.  Tonight, a guest with a reputation as sharp as a razor blade had arrived, demanding a room overlooking the bay, and Barty felt utterly unprepared.  He'd only been a bell hop at the Grand Astoria for three months, and this was his first truly high-stakes assignment.

The Grand Astoria, a sprawling Victorian behemoth perched on the cliff overlooking the churning Atlantic, exuded an air of both opulent decadence and impending doom.  Faded velvet drapes concealed forgotten secrets in the opulent rooms above, while the wind howled through the creaky balconies, carrying whispers of past romances and hushed business deals.  The lobby, illuminated by a single, sputtering chandelier, smelled of aged mahogany and damp earth.  A faint, sickly sweet aroma of jasmine clung to the air, a stark contrast to the salt spray that kissed the windows, hinting at the tempest brewing outside.  The grand staircase, polished to a blinding sheen, seemed to swallow light like a hungry beast, its mahogany steps leading to unknown destinies and whispered promises.
