Silas, a man whose weathered hands spoke volumes of years spent wielding the tools of his trade, stood at the gleaming stainless steel counter, his gaze fixed on a glistening slab of beef.  The aroma, sharp and savory, mingled with the acrid tang of the brewing storm, creating a symphony of smells unique to the heart of the city.  It was a Tuesday night, the slowest part of the week for Silas, a truth he usually relished, but tonight, a peculiar sense of unease clung to the air, heavy as the falling rain.
