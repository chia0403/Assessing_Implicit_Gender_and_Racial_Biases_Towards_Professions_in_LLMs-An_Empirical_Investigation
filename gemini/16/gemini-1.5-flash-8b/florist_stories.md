The biting November wind whipped Amelia Nightingale's crimson scarf around her neck, tugging at the delicate floral arrangements she carried.  Grey clouds, thick and brooding, pressed against the leaden sky, mirroring the perpetually damp atmosphere of the cobbled alleyway.  A pungent aroma of damp earth and decaying leaves hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the sweet perfume of lilies and roses that usually filled her tiny shop, "Blooming Blossoms." Today, however, the shop felt shuttered, the interior shrouded in a melancholy quiet, a stark testament to the approaching winter.  Amelia, her breath fogging in the frigid air, clutched the delicate, almost fragile, bouquet of winter jasmine and snowdrops.  These were for Mrs. Eleanor Vance, a regular customer who had insisted, despite the bleakness, on a splash of springtime in her living room.


Amelia's shop, Blooming Blossoms, was nestled in a quiet, almost forgotten corner of the ancient town of Oakhaven, a labyrinth of twisting, narrow streets and crumbling brick buildings.  The shop itself was a quaint little box, painted a cheerful, almost jarring, shade of sunshine yellow.  Small, hand-crafted windows let in just enough light to illuminate the colourful display of plants and flowers carefully arranged within.   A constant, gentle hum of bees, drawn to the blooming roses in the small courtyard outside, was often the only sound besides the rustle of Amelia's apron as she worked. The faint glow of street lamps cast long, dancing shadows over the cobblestones, highlighting the delicate beauty of the flowers with a melancholic elegance.
