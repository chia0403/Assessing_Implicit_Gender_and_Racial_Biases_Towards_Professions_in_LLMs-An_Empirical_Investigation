The humid air hung heavy in the apothecary, thick with the scent of lavender, rosemary, and something faintly metallic, a lingering scent Amelia, nee Amelia Carmichael, found increasingly unsettling.  Sunlight, fractured by the stained-glass window depicting St. Sebastian, painted shifting patterns across the polished mahogany counters.  Dust motes danced in the beams, illuminated by the faint glow of the gas lamps outside, casting long, skeletal shadows that stretched across the shelves filled with rows of glass jars, each containing a different concoction – remedies, elixirs, potions – the very essence of a bygone era.  Amelia, PHARMACIST CARMICHAEL, adjusted the spectacles perched precariously on her nose, her brow furrowed in concentration.  The faint, rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner punctuated the silence, a counterpoint to the whisperings of the wind that seemed to moan through the ancient stones of the building.  It was a Tuesday, late afternoon, in the quiet town of Oakhaven, nestled in the foothills of the Whispering Mountains.  The annual Midsummer Faire was just a week away, and the air buzzed with anticipation, but inside the apothecary, a sense of unease had settled, as thick as the morning mist.
