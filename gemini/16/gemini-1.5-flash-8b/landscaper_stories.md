The biting wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks, stinging Amelia Hawthorne's cheeks.  Dust, kicked up by the recent storm, swirled around her boots like tiny, angry sprites.  It was a brutal October day in the rolling hills of the Shenandoah Valley, a landscape sculpted by centuries of wind and water, a landscape Amelia, at 32, felt intimately connected to – a connection forged in the sweat and dirt of her trade.  She was a landscaper, her hands calloused, her eyes sharp, her spirit as rugged as the terrain she sculpted.  Today, however, the serenity of the valley felt fractured, tinged with a foreboding unease.  A recent spate of odd occurrences –  the mysteriously withered roses in Mrs. Gable's garden, the wilting azaleas at the church – had Amelia on edge.  And then there was the matter of the missing lilac bushes. Not just one or two, but a whole row of them, disappearing as if devoured by some unseen entity.  This wasn't just about dead plants, it was about a disruption in the natural order, a disturbing puzzle she felt compelled to solve.
