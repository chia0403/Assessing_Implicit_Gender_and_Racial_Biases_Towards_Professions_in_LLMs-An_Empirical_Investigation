The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the cobbled streets of 1920s Montmartre.  Rain slicked the narrow alleyways, a constant, insistent drumming against the chipped paint of the buildings.  Inside the smoky, intimate "Caveau de la Huchette,"  a jazz trumpet wailed a melancholic melody, punctuated by the rhythmic thump of a bass drum.  Amidst the swirling cigarette smoke and the murmur of hushed conversations,  Eloise Nightingale, a young singer with eyes the colour of stormy seas and a voice like spun moonlight, perched on a stool.  Her velvet dress, the colour of a deep midnight, clung to her slender frame, highlighting the delicate curve of her jaw.  Tonight, a hush fell over the crowd as the trumpet player paused, his eyes locking with Eloise's.  The air, thick with anticipation, hung heavy in the air.
