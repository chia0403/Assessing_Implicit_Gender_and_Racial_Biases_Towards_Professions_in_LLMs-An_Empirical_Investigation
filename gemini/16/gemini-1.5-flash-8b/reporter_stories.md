The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks as she hunched deeper into the dilapidated doorway of the "Rusty Mug."  Rain, slick and relentless, hammered against the corrugated iron roof, mirroring the relentless drumming of the questions in her head.  Inside, the flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows on the faces of the regulars, their hushed whispers a counterpoint to the storm raging outside.

Amelia, a stringer for the *Echo Gazette*, was on the hunt for a story, a story buried beneath the layers of grime and despair that clung to this forgotten corner of Oakhaven.  The town, nestled between the towering peaks of the Whisper Mountains and the churning, grey expanse of the Withering Marsh, had a reputation for whispers, for secrets tucked away like forgotten treasures.  But tonight, the whispers were tinged with fear, a chilling undercurrent that suggested something far more sinister than a simple tale of woe.  The recent disappearances of young women, their absence as sudden and silent as the settling of the mist, had sent ripples of panic through the town's already fragile tranquility.

Oakhaven wasn't known for its elegance.  Its cobblestone streets, once bustling with life, were now mostly deserted, lined with boarded-up shops and houses that stood as silent sentinels to the town's faded glory.  The Whisper Mountains, cloaked in perpetual twilight, loomed over the town like watchful guardians, their peaks shrouded in a mystery as deep and ancient as the forest that clung to their foothills.  Amelia knew, deep in her bones, that this story wouldn't be easy to unearth.  Tonight, however, she felt the familiar pull of a good story, a siren song promising the truth, even if it meant facing the dark heart of Oakhaven.
