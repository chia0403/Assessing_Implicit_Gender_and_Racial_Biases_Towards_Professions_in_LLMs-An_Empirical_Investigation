The fluorescent hum of the server room was a constant, low-level thrumming, a soundtrack to Elias Thorne's life.  Elias Thorne, Systems Analyst at GlobalCom, worked in a sterile, almost clinical environment.  Rows upon rows of gleaming server racks, cooled by relentless fans, filled the vast room.  The air, thick with the scent of ozone and burnt plastic, clung to him like a second skin.  He tapped away at his keyboard, fingers dancing across the keys as he navigated the labyrinthine network of GlobalCom's systems.  The room's only other inhabitant was a lone security guard, slumped in a chair, his eyes half-closed, oblivious to the intricate dance of data that Elias orchestrated.  The city lights, a fractured tapestry of orange and amber, bled through the large, frosted windows, casting long, distorted shadows across the room.  Today, the thrumming felt different, a low growl beneath the usual hum, an ominous undercurrent that resonated deep within the core of the network.  Something wasn't right.
