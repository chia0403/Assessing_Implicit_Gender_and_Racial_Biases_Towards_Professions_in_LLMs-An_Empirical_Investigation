The rain hammered against the arched glass of the Grand Orl√©ans Hotel, a symphony of muted percussion that seemed to echo the anxieties swirling within Amelia Dubois.  The year was 1928.  Paris, a city draped in the opulent glamour of the Jazz Age, pulsed with a feverish energy that Amelia, the hotel's concierge, felt only as a distant hum.  Her office, tucked away on the ground floor, was a haven of controlled chaos.  A brass-bound ledger, filled with meticulously penned guest requests and reservations, lay open on the mahogany desk beside a half-eaten croissant and a chipped porcelain teacup.  Sunlight, filtered through the rain-streaked windows, painted the room in a soft, golden hue, highlighting the intricate carvings of the antique furniture and the dust motes dancing in the air.  Amelia, dressed in a tailored navy suit and a crisp white blouse, stared out at the churning Parisian street, a faint frown etching itself onto her brow.  A persistent drizzle, the Parisian equivalent of a bad omen, had been falling for three days.
