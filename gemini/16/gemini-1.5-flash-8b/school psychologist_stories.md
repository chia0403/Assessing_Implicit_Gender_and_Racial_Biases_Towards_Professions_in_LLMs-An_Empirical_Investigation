The fluorescent lights of the high school hummed, a low, insistent drone that resonated with the restless energy of the students filing into the hallways.  Rain hammered against the corrugated metal roof, a relentless rhythm that mirrored the pounding thoughts in Amelia Josephine Davies' head.  Amelia, a school psychologist with five years under her belt and a perpetually tired smile, stood at the threshold of Mr. Henderson's classroom, the scent of stale coffee and despair clinging to the air.  It was a Tuesday, a day like any other, except this Tuesday felt heavier, more charged than the rest.  The whispers about the impending school-wide assembly had escalated into a low-level anxiety that hung over the entire campus. The assembly, scheduled for the last period of the day, was supposed to be a pep rally to celebrate the upcoming football season, but the palpable tension suggested something more sinister was brewing beneath the surface.


The setting was a sprawling, public high school nestled in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains.  A patchwork of aging buildings, some with peeling paint and faded murals, housed a diverse student body grappling with issues of poverty, social isolation, and familial struggles.  The school itself felt like a concrete vessel, carrying the anxieties and hopes of its inhabitants, a microcosm of the town and its surrounding landscape. The campus was bordered by a dense forest that held an almost palpable sense of mystery, its trees towering like silent sentinels over the school's anxieties.  The lingering smell of pine and damp earth was a constant reminder of the wildness that lay just beyond the school's walls.
