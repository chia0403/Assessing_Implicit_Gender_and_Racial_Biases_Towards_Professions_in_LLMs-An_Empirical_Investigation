The fluorescent lights of the Riverbend Medical Center hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* of Amelia Grace Hawthorne's own heartbeat.  It wasn't the usual pre-shift jitters; Amelia, a phlebotomist with seven years of experience under her belt, usually approached her days with a practiced calm.  But today, a different kind of unease clung to the air, thick and cloying like the scent of antiseptic that perpetually lingered in the sterile hallways.  It was a Tuesday, a typically busy day at Riverbend, but the usual cheerful chaos felt muted, replaced by a hushed, almost fearful expectancy. The waiting room, usually a cacophony of coughs, whispered conversations, and the rustling of magazines, was eerily quiet, the patients seated in stiff rows like penitents awaiting judgment.  The only sound, besides the relentless hum of the lights, was the low, rhythmic tick-tock of the ancient grandfather clock in the reception area, each second echoing the unspoken dread Amelia felt settling deep in her bones.
