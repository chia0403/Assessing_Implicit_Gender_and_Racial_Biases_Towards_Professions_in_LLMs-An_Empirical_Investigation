The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorneâ€™s auburn braid across her face as she wrestled a recalcitrant bale of hay.  Frozen clumps clung to the coarse strands, prickling her cheeks like tiny icicles.  Around her, the sprawling grounds of Blackwood Manor Animal Sanctuary groaned under the weight of the early winter storm.  Ancient oak trees, their skeletal branches clawing at the bruised sky, loomed over the rambling stone buildings, their shadows stretching long and skeletal across the snow-dusted paddocks.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and woodsmoke, carried the faint, almost mournful bleating of a lamb trapped somewhere in the labyrinthine network of barns and outbuildings.  Amelia, her breath puffing out in white clouds, straightened up, her worn leather gloves already damp from the exertion. This was Blackwood, her sanctuary, her life, and tonight, it felt particularly wild and unforgiving.
