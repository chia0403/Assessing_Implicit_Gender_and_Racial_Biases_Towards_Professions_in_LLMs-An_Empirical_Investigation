The fluorescent lights of "Quick Stop Mart" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Hernandez's Tuesday night.  Amelia, a wisp of a woman with eyes the color of faded denim and hair perpetually escaping its messy bun, stared blankly at the rotating display of discounted candy bars.  The air hung heavy with the cloying sweetness of artificial fruit and the faint, underlying stench of stale coffee and desperation. Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the already indistinct cityscape beyond.  Outside, the neon signs of the liquor store and the all-night diner fought a losing battle against the downpour, their garish glows barely piercing the gloom.  Inside, Amelia meticulously arranged a stack of lottery tickets, her movements as precise and weary as a seasoned clockwork mechanism.  Another slow night at Quick Stop Mart, another slow Tuesday creeping towards oblivion.
