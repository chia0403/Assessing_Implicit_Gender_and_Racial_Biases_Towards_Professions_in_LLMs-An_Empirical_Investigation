Fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune above, casting a sickly yellow glow on the peeling paint and the precarious stack of dirty mugs waiting for her attention – a testament to the Friday night rush that had just subsided, leaving behind a chaotic battlefield of spilled sugar packets and lingering cigarette smoke.  Elara sighed, the weight of another shift pressing down on her like the oppressive humidity.  Tonight, however, felt different.  There was a tension in the air, thicker even than the usual Friday night grime, a prickle of something unsettling that made the hairs on the back of her neck stand on end.
