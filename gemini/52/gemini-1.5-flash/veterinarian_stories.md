The biting wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vance's long, dark coat around her as she wrestled the heavy oak door of the Alder Creek Animal Clinic open.  Snow, already piled high against the weathered clapboard siding, crunched under her worn leather boots. Alder Creek itself, a tiny hamlet nestled deep within the Colorado Rockies, was a picture of hushed winter beauty: a scattering of snow-laden pines clinging to the steep mountain slopes, their branches bowed low under the weight of the fresh powder, and the frozen creek itself, a silver ribbon snaking its way through the heart of the town, barely visible beneath its icy shroud.  The air, sharp and clean, smelled of pine needles and the faint, metallic tang of the approaching storm.  Inside, the clinic was warm and surprisingly fragrant, a comforting blend of antiseptic and something vaguely animalistic â€“ a smell Eleanor had come to associate with the comforting chaos of her life.
