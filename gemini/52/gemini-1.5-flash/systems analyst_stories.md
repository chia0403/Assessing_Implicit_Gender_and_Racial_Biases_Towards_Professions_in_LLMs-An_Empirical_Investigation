The flickering neon sign of the "Lucky Dragon" noodle bar cast a lurid, orange glow across Elias Thorne's rain-slicked trench coat.  Elias, a systems analyst for the notoriously secretive firm, OmniCorp, hunched deeper into his collar, the chill wind whipping up the scent of exhaust fumes and cheap ramen.  He wasn't here for the noodles, though. The rhythmic clatter of chopsticks inside the cramped establishment was a far cry from the sterile hum of OmniCorp's server farms, yet somehow, tonight, it felt strangely comforting.  He was waiting, as heâ€™d been waiting for the past three hours, his gaze fixed on the alleyway opposite, where shadows danced and the occasional feral cat darted between overflowing bins.  The rain, a relentless downpour that mirrored the storm brewing inside him, continued to lash against the grimy windowpane.  This was not the kind of Friday night Elias Thorne had envisioned.
