The scent of bay rum and stale coffee hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, proprietor of Butterfield's Barbershop. Dust motes, illuminated by the single, dusty window overlooking Elm Street, danced in the afternoon sunbeams that slanted through the cracked glass.  Barty himself, a man whose thinning hair mirrored the dwindling fortunes of his business, sat perched on a worn leather stool, meticulously sharpening his straight razor.  The rhythmic *shhhk-shhhk* of the hone against the steel was the only sound louder than the faint tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner, its pendulum a metronome counting down the slow, quiet death of a small-town institution.  Outside, the sleepy rhythm of Summerhaven, Georgia, continued its languid pace â€“ a stark contrast to the nervous energy Barty felt churning within him.  He'd received a cryptic note that morning, a note that promised both trouble and perhaps, unexpectedly, a chance at revitalizing his fading life.
