The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Amy” Hernandez’s dark hair across her face as she wrestled the stretcher door shut.  Sirens wailed, a mournful counterpoint to the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the ambulance’s suspension struggling against the potholed streets of East Harlem. Rain, a relentless, icy drizzle, plastered her already damp uniform to her skin.  The city, a concrete labyrinth usually pulsating with a frenetic energy, was hushed under a cloak of pre-dawn gloom. Only the flickering sodium lights of the bodega on the corner and the occasional, distant howl of a dog broke the oppressive silence. Amy, a paramedic with five years of experience etched onto her weary face, leaned against the cool metal of the ambulance, the adrenaline slowly ebbing away, leaving behind the familiar gnawing exhaustion.  The air, thick with the smells of exhaust fumes and frying empanadas, did little to alleviate the lingering metallic tang of blood clinging to her gloves.  Tonight, like so many others, had been a brutal reminder of the city’s unforgiving underbelly.
