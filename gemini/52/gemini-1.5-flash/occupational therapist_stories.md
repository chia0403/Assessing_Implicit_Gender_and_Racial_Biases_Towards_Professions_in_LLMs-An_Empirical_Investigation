The biting November wind whipped Amelia Hernandez’s auburn hair across her face as she hurried down the cobbled lane, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clinging to the air.  Rain, a fine, persistent drizzle, plastered her coat to her back, but Amelia barely noticed.  She was already late, a fact that gnawed at her usually meticulous sense of order.  Her destination:  Grey Gables, a sprawling Victorian mansion perched precariously on the cliff edge overlooking the churning grey sea. It was home to her newest client, a reclusive artist known only as Mr. Silas Blackwood, and the challenge of his rehabilitation was already proving to be…interesting. The looming shadow of the house, gothic in its architecture and shrouded in an almost palpable sense of melancholy, did little to alleviate Amelia’s mounting anxiety.  She pulled her collar tighter, her breath misting in the cold air, and pushed open the heavy oak door, the sound echoing through the cavernous entrance hall like a mournful sigh.
