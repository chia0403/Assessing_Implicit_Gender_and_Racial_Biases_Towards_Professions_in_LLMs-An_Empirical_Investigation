The chipped Formica bar top felt cool beneath Elara Vance's fingertips as she polished a glass, the rhythmic swish a counterpoint to the low hum of conversation and clinking ice in the dimly lit "Rusty Mug." Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the dive bar, blurring the neon glow of the "Liquor Store" sign across the street into a hazy, psychedelic smear.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale beer, cheap whiskey, and Elara's own signature lavender-and-tobacco perfume – a subtle attempt at elegance in a decidedly un-elegant establishment.  Outside, the November wind howled a mournful tune, promising a long, cold winter. Inside, however, the Rusty Mug offered a different kind of warmth – the kind found in shared secrets and the bottom of a well-poured drink.  Tonight, Elara sensed, would be a particularly potent brew.
