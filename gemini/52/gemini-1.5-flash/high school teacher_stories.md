The chipped paint of Ms. Eleanor Vance's classroom desk mirrored the state of her own weary spirit.  Dust motes, illuminated by the weak October sun slanting through the grimy windowpanes of Northwood High, danced in the stagnant air.  The smell of stale coffee and impending deadlines hung heavy, a familiar perfume in the otherwise sterile environment. Outside, the relentless New England wind howled a mournful dirge, rattling the ancient window frames and promising a brutal winter.  Inside, Eleanor stared blankly at the stack of ungraded essays, each one a testament to the dwindling enthusiasm of her Advanced Placement English students, and a reflection of her own flagging passion for the subject she once loved so fiercely.  The worn copy of *Wuthering Heights* lay open on her desk, its pages dog-eared and underlined with notes she hadn't looked at in weeks.
