The scent of coconut and vanilla hung heavy in the air, a cloying sweetness that usually soothed Isabella “Izzy” Rodriguez, but tonight, it only amplified the tension knotting her stomach.  Izzy, a cosmetologist with fingers as nimble as a hummingbird’s wings and a heart overflowing with empathy (or at least, that’s what her clients told her), surveyed her salon, "Izzy's Glamour Garage,"  with a frown.  The usual cheerful chaos of hair dryers whirring, chattering clients, and the rhythmic snip-snip of scissors was absent, replaced by an unnerving silence punctuated only by the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner, its pendulum swinging like a metronome counting down to something dreadful.  Outside, the neon signs of Sunset Boulevard flickered intermittently, casting long, distorted shadows across the polished concrete floor, reflecting in the large mirrors that lined the walls like watchful eyes.  Tonight, even the usually vibrant colours of Izzy’s salon seemed muted, drained of their usual vibrancy, mirroring the unsettling stillness that had settled over her.
