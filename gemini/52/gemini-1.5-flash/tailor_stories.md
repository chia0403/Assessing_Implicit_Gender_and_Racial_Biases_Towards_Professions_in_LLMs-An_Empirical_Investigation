The scent of beeswax and lavender hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the November chill that seeped through the cracked windowpanes of Elias Thorne's tailoring shop.  Elias, a man whose hands were as deft with needle and thread as a surgeon's with a scalpel, meticulously pressed a crease into the sleeve of a midnight-blue velvet coat.  The shop itself, tucked away on a cobbled side street in the shadow of St. Jude's Cathedral in the bustling city of Prague, was a haven of quiet order amidst the chaotic symphony of the city.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight slicing through the gloom, illuminating the rich tapestry of fabrics draped across the walls â€“ silks shimmering like captured moonlight, velvets deep as a winter's night, and wools the colour of freshly fallen snow.  Outside, the clatter of horse-drawn carriages and the murmur of a thousand voices faded into a muted hum, swallowed by the thick stone walls that guarded Elias's sanctuary.
