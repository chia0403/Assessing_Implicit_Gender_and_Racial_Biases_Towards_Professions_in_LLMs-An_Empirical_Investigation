The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Hernandez’s hands, a meager comfort against the November chill that seeped through the drafty windows of the Legal Aid office.  Rain lashed against the grimy panes, mirroring the relentless storm brewing inside her.  The fluorescent lights hummed a discordant counterpoint to the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of her fingers against the worn wooden desk, a nervous tic she’d developed over the past few weeks.  Amelia, a paralegal with a sharp wit and even sharper instincts, was staring at a stack of files taller than her laptop, each one a testament to the crushing weight of injustice she bore witness to daily.  The air hung heavy with the scent of old paper, stale coffee, and the lingering desperation of those who sought refuge within these walls – a refuge Amelia, despite her exhaustion, was fiercely committed to protecting.  The city of Chicago, a concrete jungle teeming with both opportunity and despair, sprawled beyond the window, oblivious to the microcosm of struggle playing out within the cramped confines of Legal Aid’s west-side branch.
