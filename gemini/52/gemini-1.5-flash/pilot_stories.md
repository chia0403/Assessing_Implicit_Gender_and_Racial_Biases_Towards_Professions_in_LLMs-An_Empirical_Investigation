The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful song around Captain Evelyn "Evie" Reed's battered De Havilland Beaver, the icy breath rattling the single propellor like a skeleton's bones.  Below, the Chugach Mountains clawed at the bruised, twilight sky, their jagged peaks dusted with fresh snow that glittered like a million fractured diamonds.  Evie, bundled in layers of fleece and Gore-Tex, squinted through the swirling snow, her breath misting in the frigid cockpit air. The radio crackled with static, a counterpoint to the rhythmic thump of the engine, a sound as familiar and comforting to her as her own heartbeat.  This wasn't just another flight; it was a race against the encroaching darkness and a storm brewing with the ferocity of a vengeful god.  Her destination: a remote research station clinging precariously to the side of a glacier, its inhabitants stranded and in desperate need of supplies.
