The biting November wind whipped Amelia Katherine Hayes's auburn hair across her face as she wrestled the heavy canvas onto the easel.  Salt spray, thick as seafoam, clung to the weathered wood of the dilapidated fishing shack perched precariously on the cliffs overlooking the churning grey expanse of the Atlantic.  Amelia shivered, not entirely from the cold.  A restless energy, a familiar artistic tremor, vibrated through her as she surveyed the dramatic scene before her â€“ the furious ocean battling the stoic, wind-battered cliffs, a symphony of grey and white under a bruised, stormy sky.  This was it. The canvas, stark white and waiting, felt like a mirror reflecting the turmoil brewing within her own soul.  The tiny, isolated fishing village of Port Blossom, usually so quaint and peaceful, felt tonight like a silent, watchful accomplice to her inner chaos.
