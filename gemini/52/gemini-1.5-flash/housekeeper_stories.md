The chipped porcelain sink wept a steady drip, a mournful counterpoint to the rhythmic squeak of Amelia Grace Hawthorne's polishing cloth.  Dust motes, illuminated by the weak winter sun slanting through the grimy windowpane of the kitchen, danced in the air like tiny, mischievous spirits.  Amelia, her hands roughened by years of scrubbing and scouring, worked with a quiet efficiency born of habit, her movements as predictable and reliable as the tides.  The kitchen itself, however, was anything but predictable.  It was a sprawling, Victorian monstrosity, a testament to a bygone era of opulence now crumbling at the edges, much like the Blackwood Manor itself, the decaying gothic pile that Amelia had called home – or rather, her workplace – for the past fifteen years. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale lemon polish and something else, something subtly acrid, like decay masked by a desperate application of perfume.
