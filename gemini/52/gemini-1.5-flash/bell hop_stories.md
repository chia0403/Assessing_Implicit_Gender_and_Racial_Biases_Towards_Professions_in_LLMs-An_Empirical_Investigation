The brass spittoon gleamed under the dim, gaslit lobby of the Grand Majestic Hotel, reflecting the weary faces of the late-night arrivals.  A faint scent of stale cigar smoke and expensive perfume hung in the air, a perfume that couldn't quite mask the underlying aroma of damp velvet and age.  Outside, the Chicago wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the ornate windows and promising a blizzard before dawn.  Twenty-year-old  Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, his bellhop uniform crisp despite the relentless chill, stood patiently by the revolving door, his cap pulled low over his brow.  He adjusted the worn leather strap of his luggage cart, the polished brass gleaming dully under the weak light, a stark contrast to the glittering jewels he sometimes glimpsed on the wealthy guests who passed through his hands.  Tonight, however, the air crackled with an unusual tension; even the usually boisterous porter, Gus, had fallen silent, his eyes fixed on something beyond the lobbyâ€™s entrance.  Barty's gut clenched.  Something was coming, something he couldn't quite place, but it felt as cold and sharp as the wind tearing at the hotel's stone facade.
