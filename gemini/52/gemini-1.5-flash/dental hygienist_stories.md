The fluorescent lights of Serenity Dental hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic whir of the polishing drill in Dr. Anya Sharma’s capable hands.  Outside, the Seattle rain hammered against the panoramic windows, blurring the already hazy cityscape into an impressionistic painting of grey and muted greens.  But inside, amidst the sterile scent of antiseptic and the muted chatter of the waiting room,  Eleanor Vance, RDH, found a peculiar sort of peace.  Eleanor, with her perpetually rosy cheeks – a testament to years spent battling halitosis and plaque – meticulously examined the x-rays of her next patient, a nervous-looking teenager named Kevin Miller, whose orthodontic retainer appeared to be harbouring a small ecosystem of its own.  The aroma of impending coffee and the low thrum of anxious energy emanating from the waiting room were her constant companions, a predictable soundtrack to the carefully orchestrated chaos of a Tuesday morning at Serenity Dental.
