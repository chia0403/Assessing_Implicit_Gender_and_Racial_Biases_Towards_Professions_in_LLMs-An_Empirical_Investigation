The air hung thick and sweet with the scent of rosemary and burnt sugar, a peculiar perfume only Amelia Katherine Stone, proprietor of "Snips & Suds," could concoct.  Her tiny salon, nestled between a dusty antique shop and a perpetually-empty bakery on Bleecker Street, was a chaotic symphony of textures and sounds.  The walls, painted a vibrant turquoise that had chipped and faded in places over the years, were adorned with mismatched mirrors, framed by rusted curling irons and forgotten hairbrushes.  A vintage rotary phone, perpetually ringing with the insistent trill of unanswered calls, sat precariously on a stack of Vogue magazines dating back to the 1960s.  Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the cobblestone street, painting the scene in a warm, hazy glow.  Amelia, humming a jaunty tune somewhere between jazz and blues, expertly snipped at a client's unruly auburn curls, her shears flashing like silver fish in the afternoon light.
