The wind, a snarling terrier nipping at the heels of a bruised twilight sky, whipped Elias Thorne’s jacket around him like a frantic flag. Below, the city of Porthaven sprawled, a glittering tapestry woven with the threads of streetlights and the muted hum of distant traffic.  Elias, perched precariously on the gabled roof of a Victorian mansion – its ornate gingerbread trim now frosted with a fine layer of sleet – tightened his grip on the rusted chimney pot.  The air, thin and sharp, stung his lungs, a contrast to the dull ache in his shoulder, a souvenir from a less-than-graceful tumble earlier that week.  He adjusted his worn leather work gloves, the scent of damp asphalt and old tar clinging to them like a second skin. This wasn't just a job; it was a precarious dance with gravity, a battle against the elements, and a lonely vigil atop the sleeping city.
