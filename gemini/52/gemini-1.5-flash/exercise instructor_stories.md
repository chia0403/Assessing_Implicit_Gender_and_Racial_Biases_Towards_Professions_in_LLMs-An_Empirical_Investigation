The humid air hung thick and heavy, clinging to Amelia Hernandez like a second skin.  Sweat beaded on her forehead, reflecting the harsh fluorescent lights of the "Body Blitz" gym – a cavernous space smelling faintly of chlorine and desperation.  Amelia, with her chiseled biceps straining against the tight-fitting tank top and her fiery red hair pulled back in a practical ponytail, adjusted the microphone clipped to her sweat-dampened shirt.  Before her, a sea of expectant faces – some hopeful, some apprehensive, all slightly overweight – stared back at her, a silent testament to the promises she was about to make and the battles they were about to fight together. The thumping bassline of the pre-workout playlist vibrated through the floor, a rhythmic heartbeat to the impending onslaught of burpees and lunges.  Tonight was "Inferno Night," and Amelia, the undisputed queen of Body Blitz's high-intensity interval training classes, was ready to unleash her fiery brand of fitness.
