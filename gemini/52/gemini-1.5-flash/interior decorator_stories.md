The chipped paint on the banister of the Victorian townhouse felt gritty under Seraphina Evangeline Bellweather’s gloved fingers.  A fine layer of dust, undisturbed for decades it seemed, clung to everything – the faded Aubusson rug rolled haphazardly in the hallway, the ornate plasterwork groaning under the weight of years, even the air itself felt thick with the scent of decay and forgotten grandeur.  Seraphina inhaled deeply, a practiced professional assessing the scene.  This wasn't just a renovation; this was an archaeological dig for beautiful things buried under layers of neglect. Number 13, Grimstone Crescent, was her latest challenge, a sprawling testament to Victorian opulence slowly succumbing to the ravages of time and, she suspected, a series of exceptionally poor decorating choices. The air hung heavy with the aroma of damp wood and something faintly floral, a desperate attempt at masking the underlying mustiness, likely achieved via a potent air freshener that clashed horribly with the inherent character of the house.  This, Seraphina thought, was going to be fun.
