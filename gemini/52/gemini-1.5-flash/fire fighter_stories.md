The acrid bite of smoke stung Lieutenant Evelyn "Evie" Reed's nostrils, a familiar discomfort she’d grown accustomed to, though never truly comfortable with.  The pre-dawn gloom of a November morning clung to the narrow, cobbled streets of Port Blossom, a picturesque seaside town whose beauty was currently being brutally assaulted by a raging inferno.  Flames, a malevolent orange and yellow, licked greedily at the ancient timbers of the Captain's Whaler, a three-story inn with a reputation almost as storied as its creaking floorboards.  The air thrummed with the frantic crackle of fire, the shriek of sirens, and the guttural roar of the flames themselves – a symphony of destruction that Evie knew all too well.  The salty tang of the ocean air, usually a soothing balm, was overpowered by the choking scent of burning wood and melting plastic.  This wasn't just another fire; this was a fight for the heart of Port Blossom.
