The chipped paint of the stage door flaked like ancient memories under the relentless August sun.  Sweat beaded on the forehead of  Isabelle “Izzy” Moreau, the director of the struggling Théâtre du Soleil Noir, as she wrestled with a recalcitrant prop – a comically oversized papier-mâché rat the size of a small dog.  Dust motes, illuminated by the weak afternoon light filtering through the grimy windows of the dilapidated theatre, danced in the air, mirroring the chaotic swirl of anxieties churning within her.  The Théâtre du Soleil Noir, once a jewel of the Parisian bohemian scene, now clung precariously to existence, its glory days a faded photograph tucked away in a dusty album. Tonight was opening night of "La Souris et le Chat," a farcical melodrama Izzy had painstakingly resurrected from near oblivion, and the fate of her theatre, perhaps even her career, hung precariously in the balance. The air hung thick with the smells of stale paint, forgotten dreams, and the faint, lingering aroma of cheap Gauloises cigarettes.
