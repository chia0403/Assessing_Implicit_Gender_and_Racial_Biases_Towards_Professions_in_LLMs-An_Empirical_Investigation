The scent of aged leather and expensive perfume hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Elias Thorne, Concierge at the opulent Blackwood Hotel.  Rain lashed against the vast, arched windows overlooking Fifth Avenue, blurring the glittering city lights into a shimmering, hazy tapestry.  Inside, the Blackwood remained a sanctuary of hushed elegance, a haven from the tempest raging outside.  Elias, impeccably dressed in a charcoal grey suit that somehow managed to look both crisp and lived-in, adjusted the perfectly knotted silk tie at his throat.  The lobby, usually a vibrant hub of activity, was comparatively quiet this evening, the only sounds the gentle ticking of a grandfather clock and the rhythmic whisper of the rain.  His desk, a sleek mahogany behemoth, gleamed under the soft glow of the crystal chandelier above, awaiting the next request, the next challenge, the next opportunity to weave a little magic for the hotel's discerning guests.
