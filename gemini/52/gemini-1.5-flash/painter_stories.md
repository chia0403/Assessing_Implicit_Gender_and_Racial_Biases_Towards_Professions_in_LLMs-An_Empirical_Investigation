The salt spray stung Amelia Blackwood’s face, a familiar kiss from the unforgiving Atlantic.  She perched on the weathered grey rocks overlooking the churning grey sea, the wind whipping her auburn braid across her oilskin jacket.  The sky, a bruised purple and angry orange just before sunset, mirrored the turmoil in her heart.  Her easel, battered and faithful companion, stood beside her, its canvas a stark white square against the dramatic backdrop of the jagged cliffs of Cornwall's dramatic north coast.  The air hung thick with the scent of brine and seaweed, a constant reminder of the wild, untamed beauty that both captivated and challenged her.  This remote cove, known only to the local fishermen and a handful of hardy souls like herself, was Amelia’s sanctuary, her escape, and the source of her most powerful inspirations.
