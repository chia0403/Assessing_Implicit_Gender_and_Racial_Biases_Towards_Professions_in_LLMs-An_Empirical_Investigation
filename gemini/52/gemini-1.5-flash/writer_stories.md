The chipped mug warmed Amelia Blackwoodâ€™s hands, the lukewarm tea doing little to thaw the icy grip of the November wind that howled outside.  Rain lashed against the single-paned window of her writing shed, a miniature, weather-beaten structure perched precariously on the cliff edge overlooking the churning grey expanse of the North Sea.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of woodsmoke and old paper, a comforting counterpoint to the relentless barrage of the storm.  Amelia, a writer of gothic fiction whose success was as tempestuous as the sea outside, stared out at the churning waves, her brow furrowed in concentration, a half-written sentence clinging precariously to the edge of a page filled with spidery script.  The rhythmic crash of the waves against the rocks below provided a surprisingly soothing soundtrack to the turmoil brewing within her.  This was her sanctuary, her refuge, a place where the ghosts she conjured on paper were far less frightening than the ones she sometimes felt lurking within herself.
