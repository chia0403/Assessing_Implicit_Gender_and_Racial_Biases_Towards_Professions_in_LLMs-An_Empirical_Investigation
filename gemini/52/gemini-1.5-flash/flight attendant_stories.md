The recycled air hung thick and faintly metallic, a familiar scent to Seraphina "Sera" Moreau.  It clung to her crisp, navy-blue uniform, a second skin after ten years of navigating the pressurized cabins of Transatlantic Airways.  Outside, the pre-dawn sky over Heathrow Airport bled from bruised purple to hesitant rose, a stark contrast to the sterile glow emanating from the flickering screens of the crew lounge.  Empty coffee cups and discarded newspapers littered the small, circular tables; the remnants of a weary overnight flight from New York, a flight Sera had expertly navigated through turbulence both literal and interpersonal.  The low hum of the airport, a constant thrumming soundtrack to her life, was almost a comfort, a lullaby of predictable chaos.  Today, however, the predictability felt brittle, poised on the edge of somethingâ€¦ different.
