The scent of almond extract and vanilla hung heavy in the air, a sweet, cloying perfume that clung to everything in Clementine "Clem" Lancaster's tiny bakery. Dust motes, illuminated by the afternoon sun slanting through the grimy windowpanes, danced in the beams like tiny, sugared fairies.  Clem herself, perched precariously on a stool amidst a chaotic landscape of buttercream roses, fondant lilies, and half-finished gingerbread houses, hummed a jaunty tune, her brow furrowed in concentration as she meticulously piped a delicate spiderweb of white icing onto a three-tiered chocolate cake.  Outside, the relentless November rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of "Sugarplum Delights," a sound that was, to Clem, the comforting rhythm of a familiar lullaby.  The bakery, nestled on a cobbled side street in the perpetually damp town of Seabrook, was as much a part of her as the flour dusting her apron.
