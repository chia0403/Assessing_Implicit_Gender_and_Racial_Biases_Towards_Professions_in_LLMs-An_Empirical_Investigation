The biting November wind whipped Amelia Hawthorne’s hair across her face, stinging her cheeks a vibrant, angry red.  She pulled her worn woolen scarf tighter, the rough fabric scratching against her chapped skin, a familiar discomfort.  Above, the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks clawed at the bruised twilight sky, their silhouettes stark against the rapidly fading light.  Amelia shivered, not entirely from the cold.  She was standing at the edge of Blackwood Manor’s sprawling grounds, a place steeped in history, secrets, and an unnerving stillness that had settled over it like a shroud in the past few weeks. The manor itself, a gothic behemoth of grey stone and shadowed eaves, loomed before her, its countless windows like dark, unseeing eyes staring out into the gathering gloom.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, a perfume that, in other circumstances, Amelia would have found comforting. Tonight, however, it only amplified the unsettling feeling that something was profoundly wrong.
