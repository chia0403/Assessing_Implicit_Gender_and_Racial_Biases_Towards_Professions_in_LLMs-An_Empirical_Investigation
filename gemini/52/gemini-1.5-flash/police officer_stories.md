The salt spray stung Detective Inspector Amelia “Mia” Stone’s face as the November wind howled a mournful dirge across the craggy cliffs of Cornwall.  Rain, the kind that chilled you to the bone before it even touched your skin, lashed against the battered Land Rover Defender, blurring the already-dim light of the approaching dusk.  Below, the Atlantic churned, a restless beast gnawing at the base of the cliffs, its roar a constant, unsettling undercurrent to the mournful cries of the gulls overhead.

She gripped the steering wheel, knuckles white against the worn leather, her gaze fixed on the isolated cottage perched precariously on the cliff edge – a lone, defiant sentinel against the fury of the storm.  It was there, amongst the wind-whipped heather and the relentless roar of the sea, that the trouble had begun.
