The chipped paint of the "Welcome to Ms. Eleanor Vance's Third Grade!" sign flaked onto the already dusty windowsill, mirroring the slow decay creeping into Eleanor Vance's own spirit.  It was the last day of school before summer break, a day usually brimming with the chaotic energy of released children, but this year, a thick, suffocating silence hung over Room 3B at Oakhaven Elementary. The air, thick with the scent of stale crayons and forgotten lunches, felt heavy, laden with the unspoken anxieties that had clung to the children like burrs since the unexpected closing of the town's beloved ice cream parlor, "Scoops," three weeks prior.  Sunlight slanted weakly through the grimy panes, illuminating dust motes dancing in the otherwise still air, each one a tiny, poignant reminder of the fleeting joy that had been swept away.  Outside, the usually vibrant playground stood deserted, swings motionless, the laughter of children replaced by the mournful chirping of crickets, a sound far too melancholic for a June afternoon.
