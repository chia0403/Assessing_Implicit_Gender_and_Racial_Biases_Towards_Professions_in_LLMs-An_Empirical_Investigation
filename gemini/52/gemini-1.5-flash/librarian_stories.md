The scent of aged paper and leather, a fragrance both comforting and slightly melancholic, hung heavy in the air of the Grand Blackwood Library.  Dust motes, illuminated by the afternoon sun slanting through the arched gothic windows, danced in the stillness.  Eleanor Vance, a librarian whose life seemed as meticulously catalogued as the library's vast collection, adjusted the spectacles perched on her nose and meticulously straightened a spine slightly askew on the towering oak shelves.  The silence, usually a source of serene contentment, felt today like a suffocating blanket.  Outside, the relentless November rain lashed against the stained-glass windows, mirroring the storm brewing inside her.  It wasn't the weather, though; it was the letter.  A letter that had arrived that morning, sealed with black wax and bearing an address that sent a shiver down her spine, despite the warmth of the library surrounding her.
