The rasp of the steel cleaver against bone echoed through the cavernous chill of Bartholomew "Barty" Butchers' shop, a sound as familiar to Barty as his own heartbeat.  It was a sound that spoke of tradition, of honest work, and of the lingering scent of iron and sawdust that clung to every inch of the place like a second skin.  Barty's Butcher Shop, nestled on the cobbled side street of Grimsborough, was a relic of a bygone era, a dark and slightly chaotic space crammed with hanging carcasses, gleaming copper hooks, and the pungent aroma of curing meats.  Outside, a November wind howled, rattling the mismatched panes of the shop window and spitting icy rain against the grimy glass.  Inside, a single gas lamp cast a flickering, yellowish glow on the blood-stained apron Barty wore, highlighting the network of tiny cuts that mapped the years of his dedicated service.  Tonight, however, the usual rhythmic chop of his cleaver was punctuated by an unsettling silence, broken only by the rhythmic drip, drip, drip of something… unusual… from a newly delivered side of beef.
