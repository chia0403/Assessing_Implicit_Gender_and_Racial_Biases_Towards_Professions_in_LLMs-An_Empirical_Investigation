The biting wind whipped across the slate shingles, a symphony of rustling and rattling that only a roofer like Arthur Thomas Pemberton could truly appreciate. Not for its musical quality, of course, but for the way it hinted at loose tiles and the potential for a lucrative morning. He gripped the cold copper chimney flashing, its green patina slick beneath his thick, calloused gloves, and surveyed his domain: the sprawling, gothic-revival mansion perched atop Beacon Hill, overlooking a panoramic view of Boston Harbor.

The house, known locally as "Blackwood Manor," was a hulking mass of grey stone and imposing gables, a testament to a bygone era of wealth and eccentricity. Legend had it that a sea captain, Captain Silas Blackwood, had built it over a century ago, brick by agonizing brick, after returning from a decade at sea. Rumors swirled about hidden rooms, pirate treasure buried somewhere on the grounds, and the ghostly moans of a lovelorn widow still waiting for her husband's return. Arthur, a practical man, didn't put much stock in ghost stories, but he couldn't deny the house had a certainâ€¦ atmosphere. A heavy, almost oppressive feeling that settled in your bones and made you want to finish the job and get back down to solid ground.

Today, however, he wasn't just patching a leak. He was tasked with inspecting the entire roof, following reports of a worrying sag in the attic. Blackwood Manor was crumbling, slowly but surely, and Arthur Pemberton was the man tasked with holding it together, piece by agonizing piece.
