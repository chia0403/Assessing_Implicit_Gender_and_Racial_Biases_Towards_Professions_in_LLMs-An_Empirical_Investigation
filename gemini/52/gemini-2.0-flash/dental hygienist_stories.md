The insistent, high-pitched whine of the Cavitron scaler filled the otherwise sterile silence of examination room three. Clara Beatrice Finch, a dental hygienist with thirteen years of experience and a permanent crease between her eyebrows from concentrating, meticulously scraped away a particularly stubborn patch of calculus from the lower right molar of Mr. Henderson, her 9:00 a.m. patient. Sunlight, fractured by the intricate lacework of the window blinds, painted zebra stripes across his bib. Clara adjusted her mask, her breath fogging the plastic shield.

The setting was the "Pearly White Paradise" dental office, a cheerfully-named but somewhat cramped space located on the second floor of a brick building overlooking Main Street in the quaint, perpetually-fall-decorated town of Harmony Falls, Pennsylvania. Harmony Falls prided itself on its annual pumpkin festival, its covered bridge, and its uncanny ability to attract tourists seeking "old-fashioned charm." Pearly White Paradise, while immaculately clean, was stubbornly stuck in the 1990s aesthetically, complete with floral wallpaper and outdated motivational posters featuring smiling cartoon teeth. It was a far cry from the sleek, modern practices Clara saw advertised in the dental hygiene magazines she devoured in her precious few moments of downtime. And yet, Harmony Falls was home, and Pearly White Paradise was where sheâ€™d built her career, one meticulously-cleaned molar at a time.
