## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights of the Midwest Regional Home Expo hummed a monotonous tune, a tune that mirrored the gnawing anxiety in Ronald Bartholomew Finch's gut. He adjusted the knot of his tie, a gaudy paisley number he'd convinced himself was "eye-catching," and plastered on a smile wide enough to make his cheeks ache. The aroma of stale coffee and simmering desperation hung thick in the air, mingling with the faint scent of cheap laminate flooring and the low murmur of competing vendors vying for attention. Today, Ronald Bartholomew Finch, Top Salesman of the Month (last month, anyway) at Johnson & Sons Seamless Gutters, needed a win. He *needed* a lead. He needed something, anything, to justify the fifty bucks he’d spent on the oversized foam gutter mascot perched precariously on the corner of his booth.
## Setting:

The Midwest Regional Home Expo, held at the sprawling, industrial-chic Des Moines Convention Center. It's a Saturday afternoon in late October, and the air outside is crisp with the promise of autumn. Inside, however, it’s a manufactured simulacrum of the American Dream. Rows upon rows of booths, each vying for the attention of potential homeowners, stretch as far as the eye can see. The booths are a hodgepodge of styles and products: energy-efficient windows gleaming under harsh spotlights, faux granite countertops promising "luxury on a budget," and even a mobile sauna with a surprisingly long line. Ronald Bartholomew Finch's booth, representing Johnson & Sons Seamless Gutters, is relatively modest, consisting of a folding table draped with a company-branded tablecloth, brochures featuring beaming homeowners and pristine gutters, and, of course, the aforementioned oversized foam gutter mascot, affectionately (and ironically) nicknamed "The Gutter Bloke." The atmosphere is a mix of weary anticipation and aggressive salesmanship, punctuated by the occasional squeal of delight from a prize-winning raffle or the disgruntled sigh of a husband dragged along against his will. It's a battlefield for the attention of the middle class, a place where dreams are sold and disappointments are readily available.
