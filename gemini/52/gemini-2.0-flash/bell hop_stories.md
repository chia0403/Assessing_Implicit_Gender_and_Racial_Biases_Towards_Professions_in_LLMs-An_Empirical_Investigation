Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a bellhop protagonist:

**Setting:** The Grand Majestic Hotel, a sprawling art deco landmark in Miami Beach, Florida. It was built in the 1930s, a testament to extravagance, with towering palm trees lining the entrance, a lobby shimmering with polished marble and crystal chandeliers, and the constant, faint scent of saltwater and jasmine wafting in from the ocean. Even though it's seen better days, a faded elegance clings to everything, a whisper of old Hollywood glamour.

**Opening:**

The Miami sun, relentless and unforgiving, beat down on the Grand Majestic Hotel, turning the polished chrome accents into blinding flashes. Inside, cool air conditioning offered sweet relief, and in the midst of this sanctuary, Ferdinand Bartholomew "Ferdy" Finch, a bellhop for the past eight years, wiped a bead of sweat from his brow with a practiced swipe. He straightened his slightly too-tight uniform – a maroon jacket with gold epaulets that always felt like it was conspiring to strangle him – and plastered on his most welcoming smile. The revolving doors spun, announcing a new arrival, and Ferdy instinctively moved forward, his hand outstretched to assist. He knew every creak and groan of the building, every whispered rumor from the staff, and, more importantly, every guest's tell, the subtle signs that hinted at whether they were here for a honeymoon, a business deal gone wrong, or something far more complicated. This new arrival, a woman with eyes the color of the ocean and a suitcase that looked like it had seen better days, held a mystery that Ferdy, with a lifetime of studying faces, was already eager to unravel. "Welcome to the Grand Majestic," he announced, his voice a practiced blend of warmth and professionalism. "May I take your bag?"
