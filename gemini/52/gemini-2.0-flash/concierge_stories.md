**Story Opening & Setting:**

The scent of lilies and old money hung heavy in the air of the Grand Florentine Hotel.  Rain lashed against the ornate windows, blurring the already hazy London skyline into a watercolor of grays and golds.  Inside, however, the lobby shimmered with a subdued elegance, all polished marble and hushed conversations.  A string quartet, perched discreetly behind a towering arrangement of orchids, played a melancholic piece by Debussy.

Behind the mahogany concierge desk, **Alistair Humphrey Bartholomew Finch**, better known to the hotel's clientele as simply "Mr. Finch," adjusted the knot of his silk tie. His eyes, the color of faded denim, scanned the lobby with a practiced ease, cataloging arrivals, departures, and potential needs with the efficiency of a seasoned hawk. He’d seen it all in his twenty years at the Florentine - scandalous affairs, surprise engagements, whispered business deals, and the occasional misplaced tiara. Tonight, however, there was a different kind of tension in the air. A palpable hum that resonated beneath the surface of the hotel’s carefully cultivated tranquility. It wasn’t the usual anticipation of a gala or the hushed excitement of a celebrity sighting. This was something else. Something… brittle.  He straightened a stray card on the desk, a reservations request for the Earl of Ashworth, and a smile, practiced and polite, touched his lips.  He hoped, for the sake of the Florentine’s reputation, that whatever storm was brewing stayed firmly outside its gilded doors.  He had a feeling, though, that his hope was in vain.
