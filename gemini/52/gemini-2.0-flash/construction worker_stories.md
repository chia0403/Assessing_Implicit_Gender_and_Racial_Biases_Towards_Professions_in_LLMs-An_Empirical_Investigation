## Opening:

The jarring screech of metal against metal sliced through the morning fog, a sound as familiar to Arthur Pendelton as his own heartbeat. He winced, briefly closing his eyes behind the safety glasses that were perpetually perched on his nose, even before he clocked in. Someone on the crew was having a particularly rough go of getting the rebar cage aligned for the foundation pour. Arthur sighed, the condensation of his breath puffing out in a small, white cloud. Another day, another symphony of controlled chaos. He hoisted his thermos higher, the lukewarm coffee sloshing against the lid, and started walking towards the epicenter of the noise.

## Setting:

Arthur Pendelton was knee-deep in a crater of mud and steel, a construction site blooming slowly but surely on the outskirts of Oakhaven, a town that had once considered itself safely insulated from the relentless march of progress. The project was a new shopping mall, the harbinger of chain stores and parking lots that promised to swallow up the last vestiges of the old orchards and farmland. The ground itself felt like it was fighting back; a stubborn clay that clung to everything and held onto the water like a miser clutching gold.

The air was thick with the smell of diesel, damp earth, and the acrid tang of welding fumes. Towering cranes, like prehistoric birds, stretched their necks towards the overcast sky, dwarfing the skeletal framework of the mall that was slowly rising from the ground. Around Arthur, a hive of activity buzzed: the rhythmic pounding of jackhammers, the whine of power saws, the shouts of foremen barking orders, and the constant rumble of dump trucks hauling away the earth that was resisting its transformation into concrete and commerce.
