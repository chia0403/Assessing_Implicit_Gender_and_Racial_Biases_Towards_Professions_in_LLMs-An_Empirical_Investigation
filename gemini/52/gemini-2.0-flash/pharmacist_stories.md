Okay, here's a story opening and setting, featuring our pharmacist:

**Story Opening:**

The bell above the door jingled, a sound Beatrice Eleanor Ainsworth had come to both rely on and resent. It was 6:58 PM, two minutes before closing at Ainsworth's Apothecary, and Beatrice was already mentally counting down the seconds until she could lock up, microwave her leftover lentil soup, and finally start that historical romance novel that had been mocking her from the nightstand for weeks. She sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose. Every night was the same: a last-minute customer, usually with a minor ailment and a complicated prescription, delaying her escape into the fictional world of bodice-ripping dukes and windswept moors.

The figure silhouetted against the darkening street outside was tall and shrouded in a heavy coat, even for a late October evening in Havenwood. Beatrice braced herself for the inevitable conversation about generic brands and dosage instructions, pasting on the practiced smile she reserved for the truly difficult clientele. "Good evening," she called out, her voice a little too cheerful. "How can I help you?"

The figure stepped inside, the dim gaslight casting long, distorted shadows across the aisles of tinctures and remedies. It wasn't a customer looking for cough syrup. It was a man, and he wasn't smiling. He was carrying a package, wrapped in brown paper and tied with twine, that looked entirely too heavy. And the look in his eyes…that was not the look of someone suffering from a common cold.

**Setting:**

The story is set in Havenwood, a small, somewhat isolated town nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains in western Pennsylvania. It’s late October, just a few days before Halloween, and the air is crisp with the scent of woodsmoke and decaying leaves. Havenwood has a vaguely Victorian feel, with many of the buildings dating back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Ainsworth's Apothecary is located on Main Street, housed in a two-story brick building with large, arched windows that display an assortment of antique apothecary jars and hand-painted signs advertising remedies for everything from insomnia to indigestion. Inside, the apothecary is a maze of wooden shelves stocked with bottles, jars, and packets of herbs, tinctures, and medications. The air is thick with the scent of chamomile, lavender, and the faint, lingering odor of something distinctly medicinal - a comforting, if slightly overwhelming, aroma. A large, antique cash register sits on the counter, a relic from a bygone era when handwritten prescriptions were the norm. Behind the counter is a small compounding area, where Beatrice prepares custom medications according to her customers' specific needs. The overall atmosphere is one of old-world charm and quiet, almost forgotten remedies, a stark contrast to the modern world that exists just beyond Havenwood's borders.
