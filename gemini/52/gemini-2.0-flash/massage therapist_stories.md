The late afternoon sun, already sinking behind the jagged peaks of the Cascade Mountains, cast long, dancing shadows across the polished floor of "The Zen Zone" spa. The air hung thick with the scent of lavender and eucalyptus, a meticulously crafted aroma designed to coax even the most tightly wound city dweller into a state of blissful serenity. Inside, nestled amongst plump, moss-green cushions and trickling water fountains, sat Seraphina Willowbrook, massaging her temples with the pads of her thumbs.

Her own serenity, ironically, was proving elusive. Today had been a brutal parade of knotted shoulders and stressed-out jaws. She loved her work, truly, finding a deep satisfaction in easing pain and helping people reconnect with their bodies. But sometimes, the sheer volume of negativity she absorbed, the collective tension she kneaded out, left her feeling like a squeezed-out tube of toothpaste.

The Zen Zone, a haven of calm tucked away in the bustling tourist town of Leavenworth, Washington, was owned by a perpetually tanned woman named Ingrid, whose pronouncements about "positive vibrations" could be a little grating, even for Seraphina. However, the location was perfect. Tourists flocked to Leavenworth for its Bavarian theme, its festivals, and its proximity to some of the most breathtaking scenery in the Pacific Northwest. And, of course, to de-stress.

Seraphina sighed, the scent of the aromatherapy diffuser doing little to soothe the tightness in her chest. Her last client of the day, a frantic lawyer from Seattle, had left her feeling particularly drained. As she gathered her long, auburn hair into a messy bun, she heard the chime of the front door, signaling a new arrival. Oh, please no, she thought. Not another last-minute appointment. Ingrid knew she was supposed to leave at six.

But as she smoothed down her turquoise tunic and plastered on a professional smile, Seraphina Willowbrook couldn't help but wonder who, or what kind of tension, awaited her just beyond the softly illuminated reception area.
