The acrid smell of burnt plastic hung heavy in the air, a metallic tang clinging to the back of Abigail “Abby” Rosewood’s throat. She grimaced, wiping a bead of sweat from her brow with the back of her forearm, smearing a smudge of grease across her tan skin. The humid Savannah air, thick as cotton candy, clung to her overalls, making them feel like a second, unwelcome skin.

Abby crouched precariously in the crawl space beneath Mrs. Higgins’ porch, the low-slung structure pressing down on her like a suffocating blanket. Sawdust motes danced in the weak beam of her headlamp, illuminating the claustrophobic space filled with dusty insulation, cobwebs thick as fishing nets, and the unsettling quiet only broken by the occasional scuttling of some unseen critter.

The house itself was a classic example of Southern charm, a sprawling Victorian with gingerbread trim and a wraparound porch that whispered of lemonade on summer evenings. But beneath the charming facade, age was taking its toll. Wiring from the 1940s snaked through the floor joists like brittle veins, a chaotic jumble of cloth insulation and cracked copper, a fire hazard just waiting to happen. Mrs. Higgins, bless her heart, had been complaining about flickering lights and a suspicious buzzing sound in the kitchen. Abby suspected this wasn't just a quick fix. This was a full-blown electrical heart attack, and she, Abigail Rosewood, electrician extraordinaire, was the only one who could save it.
