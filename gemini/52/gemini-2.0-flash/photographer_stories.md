Okay, here's a story opening and setting:

**Opening:**

The biting wind, smelling of salt and fish scales, ripped through Astrid Holmquist's scarf, tugging at the ends like a playful, icy dog.  She squinted against the late afternoon sun, which, despite its fierceness, offered little warmth on this godforsaken spit of land.  Clutching her weathered Nikon F3 tighter, its brass gleaming dully beneath her gloved fingers, Astrid cursed her impetuous decision to drive all the way to this place.  The lighthouse keeper's cryptic message – "She comes back to sing in the stones, and she will weep if no one remembers" – had been enough to yank her out of her carefully curated urban life, promising a story that screamed to be captured on film. But now, standing ankle-deep in freezing, churned-up sand, with nothing but screaming gulls and the ceaseless roar of the North Sea for company, Astrid was beginning to suspect the old man was either a complete loon or deliberately leading her on a wild goose chase.

**Setting:**

The story opens on a narrow, windswept peninsula in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland, specifically on the beach just below the abandoned North Point Lighthouse.  The landscape is stark and unforgiving, dominated by grey, jagged rocks and dunes of coarse, windswept grass.  The sea is a restless, pewter grey, churning constantly against the shore.  The sky is vast and dramatic, constantly shifting with the weather; right now, it's a mix of brilliant, pale blue and threatening, slate-colored clouds.

The remnants of a small, forgotten fishing village huddle further inland, crumbling stone walls half-buried in the sand, whispering tales of lives lived and lost to the sea. The overall impression is one of isolation, stark beauty, and a profound sense of history clinging to the air. The time of year is late autumn, adding to the bleakness and the feeling of nature's dominance.
