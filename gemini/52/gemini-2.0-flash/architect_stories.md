Okay, here's a story opening with setting, including the full name of the main character, who is an architect:

**Story Opening:**

The salt-laced wind whipped around Eleonora Isabella Rossi, tugging at the silk scarf sheâ€™d hastily tied around her neck. The biting air did little to quell the fire in her belly, a familiar cocktail of excitement and dread. Before her, the island of Stromboli rose from the Tyrrhenian Sea, a jagged black pyramid shrouded in a perpetual haze of volcanic ash. It wasn't the most hospitable of landscapes, but Eleonora found herself drawn to it nonetheless. 

"Magnificent, isn't it?" A gruff voice rumbled beside her. Captain Esposito, a man whose face mirrored the craggy volcanic rock of his home, spat a stream of tobacco juice into the churning waves. "The old girl's got a temper, but she's been sleeping soundly for years. Long may it last."

Eleonora offered a tight smile, her gaze fixed on the desolate coastline. Sleeping soundly? More like holding her breath. That's the kind of risk she took to come to the island. The project she would undertake here was nothing short of impossible.

**Setting:**

The story opens on the deck of a small, weathered ferry approaching the volcanic island of Stromboli, part of the Aeolian Islands north of Sicily. The sea is a deep, unforgiving blue, choppy with whitecaps. The sky is overcast, hinting at rain. Stromboli itself is a dramatic, stark landscape dominated by its active volcano. Black sand beaches line the coast, dotted with small, whitewashed houses clinging precariously to the hillsides. The air is thick with the smell of sulfur and the ever-present grit of volcanic ash. It's a remote, unforgiving, yet undeniably beautiful place.
