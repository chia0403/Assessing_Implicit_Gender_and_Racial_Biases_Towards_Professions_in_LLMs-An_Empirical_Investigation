The air hung thick and heavy with dust, the relentless sun beating down on the parched earth of Aethelgard. Every breath Thomas Ashton took tasted of powdered limestone and grit, a familiar taste he'd known since he was barely taller than the smallest chisel in his father's workshop. He squinted, the fine lines etched around his eyes deepening in the bright glare. Today, the stone was particularly unforgiving, stubbornly resisting the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of his hammer against the steel of his point.

He was perched precariously on a makeshift scaffolding of rough-hewn planks, some twenty feet above the bustling marketplace of Aethelgard. Below him, the scene was a kaleidoscope of vibrant colours and chaotic energy. Merchants hawked their wares in booming voices, children chased pigeons through the crowded stalls laden with fruits and textiles, and the ever-present donkeys brayed their displeasure at the constant jostling. All of it a distant hum, muffled by the rhythmic clang of metal on stone.

Thomas, however, was lost in his work. He was shaping a gargoyle for the east wing of the High Chancellor's new palace, a commission that represented a significant step up in his career. The stone, a massive block of pale, almost ethereal limestone, had been quarried from the Whispering Cliffs beyond the city, renowned for its purity and the rumour that it held the faint echoes of forgotten gods. He felt a responsibility to the stone, to coax the beast hidden within to life, to capture the Chancellor's vision of a terrifying guardian. He paused, wiped the sweat from his brow with the back of his hand, and considered the stubborn angle of its jaw. It needed something moreâ€¦ something sinister. He would continue his work as the sun set and the market below grew quiet.
