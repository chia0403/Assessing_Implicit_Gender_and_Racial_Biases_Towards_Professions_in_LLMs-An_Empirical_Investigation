Okay, here's a story opening and setting, featuring a main character named as you requested:

**Story Opening:**

The scent of rain-soaked asphalt and over-brewed coffee hung heavy in the air, clinging to the worn leather of Evelyn Beatrice Montgomery’s briefcase. She hadn't slept a full night in what felt like weeks, the endless redrafting of the quarterly budget report a constant phantom limb, throbbing with anxiety. Outside, the city was just starting to shake off the last of the night’s downpour, the early morning light reflecting off the slick sidewalks and turning the towering glass and steel buildings into shimmering, ghostly apparitions.

Evelyn hated mornings. Especially mornings like this, that were a physical manifestation of the pressure cooker her life had become. She adjusted the strap of her designer handbag, a silent apology to her back for the weight it carried, both literal and metaphorical. Today was the day the board reviewed her department's performance. Today was the day her career – her entire carefully constructed life – could either soar, or plummet into the murky depths of corporate restructuring. She took a deep breath, tasted the bitterness of the coffee she hadn’t yet drunk, and stepped onto the crosswalk.

**Setting:**

The story is primarily set in **downtown Seattle, Washington, in the early 2020s.**

*   **Specific locations will include:** The towering office building housing "OmniCorp," a multinational technology conglomerate where Evelyn is a senior executive in the Finance department.

*   **Key visual elements:** Sleek, modern architecture, bustling streets filled with tech workers, the constant presence of rain (or the threat of it), and the contrast between the high-powered corporate world and the grittier elements of the city.

*   **Atmosphere:** A sense of relentless ambition, high-stakes competition, and underlying tension. The city itself, with its blend of natural beauty and technological advancement, mirrors Evelyn's internal conflict between her professional aspirations and a deeper, more fulfilling life.
