Okay, here's a story opening and setting, focusing on a school psychologist:

**Setting:**

The fluorescent lights hummed a discordant tune in the otherwise sterile hallway of Northwood High. Lockers, adorned with magnets, band stickers, and hastily scribbled phone numbers, lined the pale green walls. The scent of industrial cleaner hung heavy in the air, battling a losing war against the lingering aroma of yesterday's mystery meat. It was a Thursday afternoon, the lull between the frenzied chaos of lunch and the weary exodus of the final bell. Outside, a persistent autumn rain lashed against the large, grime-streaked windows, painting the world in shades of gray.

**Opening:**

Dr. Eleanor Abigail Vance pinched the bridge of her nose, the faint imprint of her glasses leaving a red mark on her skin. The migraine was back, a dull throb building behind her eyes that threatened to explode with every dropped textbook and boisterous shout echoing down the hall. She leaned back in her worn, faux-leather office chair, the springs groaning in protest. On her desk, a chaotic landscape of student files, half-empty coffee cups, and a rogue stress ball shaped like a brain stared back at her. A small, framed photograph of her scruffy terrier, Watson, offered the only point of genuine cheer. She took a deep breath, trying to center herself before her next appointment: fifteen-year-old Ethan Carter, referred for anger management after an unfortunate incident involving a cafeteria tray and the school bully. Eleanor sighed. Just another day navigating the emotional minefield that was Northwood High.
