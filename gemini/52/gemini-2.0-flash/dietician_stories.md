Okay, here's a story opening and setting, featuring a dietician:

**Setting:** A cramped, bustling farmers market in Asheville, North Carolina, on a Saturday morning in late September. The air is crisp with the scent of woodsmoke, ripe apples, and damp earth. The Blue Ridge Mountains loom majestically in the distance, their peaks shrouded in a soft, purple haze. Vendor tents are packed tightly together, overflowing with colorful produce, artisan cheeses, homemade breads, and handcrafted goods. A bluegrass band plays a lively tune from a small stage near the entrance, adding to the vibrant chaos.

**Opening:**

The familiar scent of heirloom tomatoes clung to the air, a comforting aroma that usually soothed Eliza Mae Thornton. Not today. Today, it felt like a direct assault on her already frayed nerves. Eliza, a registered dietitian with a passion bordering on obsession for sustainable eating, navigated the throngs of weekend shoppers with a forced smile plastered on her face. She clutched a tattered tote bag overflowing with kale and reluctantly sidestepped a woman juggling three jars of artisanal honey. Eliza loved the Asheville farmers market, usually. But today, she was on a mission, a mission born of desperation and a nagging guilt, and the cheerful atmosphere felt painfully out of sync with the internal turmoil churning within her.
