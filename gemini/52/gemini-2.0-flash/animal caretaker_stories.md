## Opening:

The humid air hung thick and heavy in the reptile house, a tangible curtain of damp heat pressing against Eliza Mae Blackwood's skin. She could feel the familiar sheen of perspiration forming on her forehead as she unlocked the enclosure of Bartholomew, a grumpy-faced Argentine black and white tegu who considered her, at best, a tolerated food dispenser and, at worst, an enormous, clumsy predator. 

Bartholomew, true to form, hissed a low, rattling sound as Eliza entered, his thick body tensing under the heat lamp. "Good morning to you too, Bartholomew," she murmured, her voice a soothing counterpoint to his reptilian displeasure. "Just bringing you your usual gourmet breakfast of minced chicken and despair."

## Setting:

Eliza works as a Senior Animal Caretaker at the **Cedar Creek Wildlife Sanctuary**, a sprawling haven tucked away in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. The sanctuary, a patchwork of fenced enclosures, winding trails, and rustic wooden buildings, is dedicated to the rehabilitation and release of injured and orphaned wildlife native to the region.

The reptile house, where Eliza spends a significant portion of her day, is a low-slung brick building humming with the mechanical whir of humidifiers and the rhythmic clicks of heat lamps. Inside, a diverse collection of snakes, lizards, turtles, and tortoises reside in meticulously crafted habitats, each replicating their natural environment as closely as possible. From the steamy, verdant enclosure of the emerald tree boa to the arid, rocky desert home of the gila monsters, the reptile house is a miniature, contained world, a stark contrast to the sprawling wilderness just beyond its walls. The air is always thick, smelling of damp earth, reptile waste, and the subtle chemical scent of cleaning solutions, a unique and somewhat unsettling aroma that Eliza has grown accustomed to over the years.
