The aroma of dust and aging paper clung to everything in "The Antiquarian's Emporium," a comforting blanket against the sharp bite of the November air outside. Rain hammered rhythmically against the leaded glass windows, blurring the already hazy London street beyond. Shelves, packed floor to ceiling with forgotten tomes and forgotten tales, lined the walls of the cramped, cluttered shop. Light, filtered through the grime on the glass, cast long, dancing shadows, making it difficult to discern whether that was a genuine first edition of Dickens or just a cleverly positioned pile of laundry.

Amelia Beatrice Plumtree, bookkeeper extraordinaire and wearer of perpetually smudged spectacles, hunched over a ledger thicker than her arm. The flickering gas lamp cast a warm glow on her face, highlighting the faint lines etched around her kind, hazel eyes. She meticulously scratched a number into the parchment with her quill, the silence punctuated only by the relentless drumming of rain and the occasional creak of the ancient building settling on its foundations. Amelia loved the Emporium, she truly did. But Mr. Bartholomew Thistlewick, its eccentric and hopelessly disorganized owner, made her job a Herculean task. He seemed to believe that the true value of a book was inversely proportional to its position in his accounting. And today, Amelia was battling with a particularly stubborn stack of receipts relating to a "rare and potentially cursed" papyrus scroll he'd acquired in Egypt. Her sigh was barely audible above the storm outside.
