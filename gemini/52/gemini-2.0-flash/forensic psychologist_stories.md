Okay, here's a story opening and setting:

**Setting:** The stark, fluorescent-lit interrogation room of the Cook County Sheriff's Department in Chicago, Illinois. The room is small, maybe ten by twelve feet, with a steel table bolted to the floor and two chairs on either side. One-way mirror dominates one wall, reflecting the sterile light back into the room. The air is thick with the stale scent of old coffee and nervous sweat. Outside, the sounds of the city—distant sirens, rumbling trucks, the low hum of activity—filter through the thick walls, a constant, unsettling thrum.

**Story Opening:**

Dr. Evelyn Reed adjusted her glasses, the cool metal a momentary respite from the prickle of anxiety that had been clinging to her like a second skin all morning. Across the steel table sat a man whose silence was as deafening as a gunshot. His name was Daniel Harding, accused of the brutal murder of his wife, Sarah, and he hadn’t uttered a single word since his arrest. Three days. Three days of stony silence, of refusing food, of staring blankly at the wall like a man hollowed out.

Evelyn had seen plenty of hollow men in her career. As a forensic psychologist specializing in violent crime, she’d interviewed the worst of the worst. She'd peered into the dark corners of the human psyche, searching for the triggers, the broken pathways that led to unimaginable acts. But Daniel Harding… there was something different about him. Something that made her skin crawl.

He wasn't defiant. He wasn't aggressive. He was…empty. Almost like a puppet whose strings had been cut. And that emptiness, Evelyn knew, could be far more dangerous than rage. She leaned forward, the faint click of her chair echoing in the oppressive silence. "Mr. Harding," she began, her voice calm and steady, a carefully constructed shield against the unease that threatened to consume her. "My name is Dr. Evelyn Reed. I'm a forensic psychologist, and I'm here to talk to you about Sarah."
