The salt spray stung Beatrice Eleanor Ainsworth's face as she wrestled with the balky lockbox, the wind whipping her perfectly coiffed blonde bob into a frenzy. She was used to this. Coastal properties, even the multi-million dollar ones like the dilapidated Victorian monstrosity looming before her, came with their own unique set of challenges. Not least of which was the inherent resentment the sea seemed to hold for anyone daring to profit from its edge.

The setting was Port Blossom, Maine. A town postcard-perfect in its quaintness, clinging to the rugged coastline like a barnacle to a whale. Weathered clapboard houses, their shutters painted in hues of nautical blue and sun-faded red, huddled together for warmth, facing the relentless Atlantic. The air, thick with the scent of brine and rotting seaweed, clung to everything. Lobster traps, piled high on the docks, cast skeletal shadows in the late afternoon sun. And everywhere, the mournful cry of seagulls echoed, a constant reminder of the wildness just beyond the harbor walls.

Beatrice, however, wasn't fazed. She had a listing to show, and a commission to earn. Even if that listing smelled faintly of decay and whispered tales of a sea captain whoâ€™d lost his mind and drowned his entire family within those very walls. Today was Tuesday. Today was selling day.
