The chipped ceramic of his coffee mug warmed Marcus Alistair Finley's calloused hands as he leaned back against the grimy brick wall of Finley & Son's Garage. It was 6:00 AM, and the late October air was crisp, carrying the scent of damp leaves and something vaguely metallic, a perfume that only true mechanics could appreciate. The garage, nestled in the sleepy, almost-forgotten corner of Harmony Creek, Ohio, was still shrouded in pre-dawn shadows. The single, flickering fluorescent light above the open bay door barely pierced the gloom, illuminating the oily concrete floor and the hulking silhouette of a '67 Mustang slowly being resurrected from automotive purgatory. A calendar pinned to the wall next to the toolbox displayed a vintage pin-up, a stark contrast to the practical, almost Spartan, environment. Marcus took a long, slow sip of his coffee, the bitter liquid a welcome jolt to his system. He needed to be sharp. Today, he had to figure out why Mrs. Henderson's prize-winning poodle wasn't the only thing barking in her vintage Cadillac.
