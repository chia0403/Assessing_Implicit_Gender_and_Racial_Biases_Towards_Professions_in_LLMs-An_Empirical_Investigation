## Story Opening & Setting:

**Opening:**

The rusty pipe surrendered with a groan, sending a shower of scaling rust and foul-smelling water down onto Beatrice "Bea" Montgomery's already soaked overalls. "Mother flippin'..." she muttered, more to the echoing pipes around her than to any divine power. The wrench slipped in her gloved hand, threatening to take her knuckles with it, and Bea tightened her grip, gritting her teeth. She’d been wrestling with this particular piece of ancient plumbing for the better part of two hours, and it felt like the very building itself was fighting her.

**Setting:**

Bea was wedged deep within the labyrinthine basement of the historical Blackwood Manor, a sprawling, Gothic monstrosity that dominated the highest hill overlooking the sleepy town of Havenwood, Maine. Cobwebs hung thick as drapes, catching the weak light filtering in through the grimy, barred windows. The air was thick with the musty scent of damp stone, decay, and something else…something vaguely floral, but unsettlingly sweet, like potpourri left too long in a mausoleum. The only sounds besides her own struggling were the occasional scuttling of unseen creatures and the distant, mournful creaks of the old house settling in on itself.
