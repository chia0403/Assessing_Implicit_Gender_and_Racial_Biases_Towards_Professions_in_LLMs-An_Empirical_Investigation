**Setting:**

The biting wind howled outside, rattling the windows of "Sugar & Spice," a small, family-run bakery nestled on a cobbled street in the historic district of Savannah, Georgia. The air inside, however, was a warm, comforting hug, thick with the scent of vanilla, cinnamon, and melting butter. Christmas lights twinkled merrily around the perimeter of the shop, casting a soft glow on the shelves lined with colorful cookies and intricately decorated cupcakes. A vintage cash register, a relic from the owner's grandmother, sat proudly on the counter, its brass gleam reflecting the festive spirit.

**Opening:**

Eleanor Beatrice Fitzgerald, her cheeks flushed from the warmth of the oven and a healthy dose of festive stress, meticulously smoothed the final layer of Swiss meringue buttercream onto the towering gingerbread castle cake. Her brow furrowed in concentration as she used a small offset spatula to create delicate battlements along the turrets. This wasn't just any cake; this was the centerpiece for the Savannah Historical Society's annual Christmas Gala, and Mrs. Abernathy, the society's notoriously exacting president, had specifically requested Eleanor's "signature architectural masterpiece." Eleanor only hoped this year's masterpiece wouldn't topple over before it reached the ballroom, like the Leaning Tower of Pisa incident two Christmases ago. The memory still made her palms sweat. She glanced at the clock above the oven. Only three hours until delivery. Time to summon all her artistry and a considerable amount of structural engineering knowledge, because this gingerbread castle was about to face a Georgia winter and a very critical audience.
