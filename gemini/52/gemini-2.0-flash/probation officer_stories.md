## Story Opening:

The chipped ceramic mug warmed Eleanor Maeve Caldwell's hands as she stared out the grimy window of the East Side Probation Office. Rain, that persistent Seattle drizzle, plastered itself against the glass, blurring the already depressing view of pawn shops and boarded-up storefronts. Eleanor took a long, lukewarm sip of her coffee, the bitter taste barely registering against the gnawing anxiety that had become her constant companion. Another Monday, another week of navigating the treacherous waters of broken promises and lives teetering on the edge.

A buzzing from her intercom jolted her. "Caldwell, you got a new intake. Johnson. Young punk. Trouble with a capital T, if you ask me." The voice of Bob, the office's resident cynic, crackled through the speaker, thick with resignation.

Eleanor sighed, placing the mug back on the desk with a dull clink. Trouble was her bread and butter, her raison d'être. But this week, even the thought of it felt heavier than usual. This week, she felt the weight of every failure, every relapse, every life she hadn’t managed to steer away from the precipice. This week, Eleanor Maeve Caldwell felt old, even though she was barely forty.

## Setting:

**The East Side Probation Office, Seattle, Washington:** The office is housed in a pre-war brick building, its exterior stained with years of grime and graffiti. Inside, the air is thick with the smell of stale coffee, cheap disinfectant, and the faint, lingering odor of desperation. The walls are a pale, institutional green, scarred with thumbtack holes and covered in motivational posters that have long lost their motivational power.

Eleanor's office, a small, cramped space, is typical of the building. A battered desk, overflowing with paperwork and case files, dominates the room. A chipped ceramic mug sits perpetually near a half-empty bottle of hand sanitizer. Behind her, a overflowing bookshelf holds a mismatched collection of legal guides, self-help books, and dog-eared paperbacks – a testament to Eleanor's constant, and often futile, search for answers. The single window, overlooking a bleak alleyway, offers a limited view of the outside world, a world Eleanor strives to help her clients navigate, one fraught decision at a time.
