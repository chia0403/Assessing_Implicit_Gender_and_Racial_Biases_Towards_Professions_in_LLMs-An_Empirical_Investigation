## Story Opening:

The incessant, mechanical whir of the dialysis machine was the only sound in the room, a monotonous counterpoint to the frantic rhythm of Dr. Eleanor Beatrice Thorne’s racing heart. Outside, the November wind howled against the windows of St. Jude's Hospital, rattling the panes like skeletal fingers demanding entry. But the storm brewing inside Dr. Thorne was far more ferocious. Sweat beaded on her forehead as she meticulously checked the levels on the machine, her hands, usually so steady, trembling ever so slightly. Her patient, a wiry old fisherman named Mr. Henderson, lay silent beneath the sterile white sheets, his face pale and drawn, the skin stretched taut over his sharp cheekbones. He’d been unresponsive for the last ten minutes, and Eleanor knew, with a sickening certainty, that time was running out. She just couldn't understand *why*.

## Setting:

The story opens in a small, windowless dialysis room located on the third floor of St. Jude's Hospital in Port Blossom, Maine. The room is stark and functional, dominated by the hulking dialysis machine and its tangle of tubes and wires. The walls are painted a sterile, institutional green, a color meant to soothe but that instead only amplifies the room's cold, clinical atmosphere. A single overhead fluorescent light casts a harsh, unflattering glow, highlighting the dust motes dancing in the air and the worn patches on the linoleum floor. A small metal cart stands beside the bed, laden with syringes, bandages, and other medical supplies. The air hangs heavy with the metallic tang of blood and the faint, antiseptic scent of disinfectant. A half-empty coffee cup sits precariously on the edge of the cart, a testament to Dr. Thorne's long and stressful shift.
