The humid Louisiana air, thick as molasses in August, clung to the exposed skin of Clementine Dubois as she unlocked the front door of “The Gilded Comb.” Sweat beaded on her brow, threatening to drip into her expertly applied eyeliner, a testament to her years of steady hand and unwavering faith in the power of a good cat-eye. 

The Gilded Comb, nestled on a quiet corner in the historic French Quarter of New Orleans, was a haven of lace curtains, faded floral wallpaper, and the faint, comforting scent of hairspray and freshly brewed chicory coffee. Sunlight streamed through the beveled glass windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and glinting off the antique mirrors lining the walls. These mirrors had seen generations of Creole belles, jazz singers, and debutantes come and go, their hair transformed under Clementine’s practiced hands.

Clementine sighed, pushing the door open and stepping inside. The bell above jingled a welcome that echoed in the stillness. Even before she flicked on the lights, she could picture it all: Madame Evangeline’s ancient armchair, draped with a shawl that smelled faintly of lavender; the chipped porcelain sink, always stocked with her favorite lavender-scented hand soap; and, of course, her sanctuary, the swivel chair in front of her station, waiting for its first client of the day. Today, that client was Mrs. Delacroix, and Clementine knew she’d be armed with gossip hotter than a pot of gumbo. Another day at The Gilded Comb was about to begin.
