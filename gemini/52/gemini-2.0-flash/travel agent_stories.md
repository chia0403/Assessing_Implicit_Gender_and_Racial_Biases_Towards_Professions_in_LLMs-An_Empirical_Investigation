## Opening:

The ringing phone sliced through the morning quiet like a serrated knife, dragging Amelia Bellweather back from the hazy edges of sleep. She groaned, burying her face in the pillow, a hopeless attempt to escape the shrill demand. It was 6:17 AM. Who on earth was calling a travel agency at this ungodly hour? Probably Mrs. Higginbottom, panicking about her chihuahua's dietary restrictions on the upcoming cruise.

Amelia reluctantly reached for the receiver on her nightstand, her hand fumbling in the dim light. "Bellweather Adventures," she mumbled, her voice thick with sleep.

"Amelia?" A voice crackled through the line, rough and urgent. "It's… it's Silas. I need your help."

Silas? Her heart skipped a beat. That name hadn't crossed her lips, or even her thoughts, in years. "Silas… what's wrong?" she managed to ask, suddenly wide awake.

## Setting:

Amelia Bellweather's life was contained within the charming, yet slightly faded, confines of Bellweather Adventures, a travel agency tucked away on a quiet side street in the historic district of Havenwood, Maine. Havenwood was the kind of town where everyone knew everyone, the air smelled perpetually of pine and saltwater, and the pace of life moved at a leisurely saunter.

Bellweather Adventures was a reflection of Amelia: cozy, a little quirky, and filled with the promise of adventure. The walls were painted a calming seafoam green and adorned with vintage travel posters showcasing exotic locales - a vibrant Moroccan souk, the majestic peaks of the Himalayas, the shimmering turquoise waters of the Maldives. A world globe, well-worn and spinning silently in the corner, hinted at the endless possibilities Amelia offered her clients.

Her desk, a sprawling antique oak piece inherited from her grandfather who founded the agency, was usually a carefully curated chaos of brochures, maps, and half-finished cups of tea. Today, however, it was surprisingly tidy, a testament to her recent, albeit unsuccessful, attempts at streamlining her business. Sunlight streamed through the large window overlooking Main Street, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and highlighting the cheerful potted ferns that thrived on the windowsill.

Despite the idyllic setting, Amelia felt a nagging sense of stagnation. Havenwood, while charming, felt small. Bellweather Adventures, though her family's legacy, felt like a cage. She longed for the adventures she booked for others, a longing that made her heart ache with a bittersweet longing for a life she hadn't yet lived.
