## Story Opening:

The insistent buzzing of the fluorescent lights above Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins' head was a fitting soundtrack to the burgeoning migraine threatening to split his skull in two. He’d sworn off microwaved burritos for lunch, but the siren song of convenience had proven too strong again. He sighed, rubbing his temples, and focused on the open laptop screen illuminating his face in the dim office. Yet another claim denial. This one was particularly galling: a perfectly legitimate tree-felling accident, denied on the grounds of "unforeseen arboreal malfeasance." What even *was* that?

Bart knew, of course. It was legalese for “we don’t want to pay.” He hated days like these, days where he felt more like an obstacle than a helper. The little old lady on the other end of the phone, Mrs. Gable, was depending on this payout to fix the hole in her roof. He’d seen the photos. The oak tree hadn’t just fallen; it had performed a full-on, theatrical swan dive onto her porch swing before crushing the eaves.

He glanced at the clock on his desk: 5:58 PM. Two minutes until sweet, blessed freedom. Two more minutes he could spend agonizing over his next move. Maybe he could argue the "arboreal malfeasance" point. Or, maybe he could just start looking for a new job. One that didn't involve translating corporate greed into palatable excuses.

## Setting:

The office of Higgins & Associates Insurance, located in the heart of Harmony Creek, Ohio, felt less like a place of comfort and security and more like a beige purgatory. The walls were painted a soul-crushing neutral tone, punctuated only by motivational posters featuring smiling stock photos of people achieving… well, Bart wasn’t quite sure what they were achieving. Mostly just smiling, apparently. The furniture was standard-issue: ergonomic chairs that somehow still managed to be uncomfortable, particleboard desks that wobbled precariously under the weight of paperwork, and potted plants that perpetually looked like they were contemplating their own demise.

Higgins & Associates occupied the second floor of a nondescript brick building overlooking Main Street. From his window, Bart could see the bustling activity of the town square: the vintage candy shop with its perpetually open door, the barber shop with its red and white pole spinning hypnotically, and the park where children played, oblivious to the anxieties of insurance adjusters. Harmony Creek was a town that prided itself on its peacefulness and predictability, a stark contrast to the chaotic world of risk and liability that Bart navigated every day. The only sound that frequently interrupted the sounds of the town was the squealing of the nearby hog farm, a constant reminder that even in Harmony Creek, life could stink.
