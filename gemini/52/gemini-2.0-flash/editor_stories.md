Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a story where the main character is an editor:

**Opening:**

The smell of stale coffee and printer toner hung heavy in the air, clinging to Amelia Thorne like a second skin. It was a smell she'd grown accustomed to, practically a perfume in the chaotic ecosystem that was the editorial floor of "Literary Lark," a small, but fiercely independent, publishing house tucked away in the heart of Boston's Beacon Hill.

**Setting:**

"Literary Lark" occupied the top two floors of a narrow, red-brick building that looked like it had been plucked straight from a Victorian novel. The offices were a charming, if slightly dilapidated, warren of rooms, each overflowing with manuscripts, proofs, and the general detritus of the creative process. Sunlight struggled to penetrate the grime-streaked windows, casting long, dusty shadows across overflowing bookshelves. Amelia's own office, a cramped space barely larger than a walk-in closet, was dominated by a towering stack of unsolicited manuscripts threatening to topple over at any moment. Pinned to a corkboard above her desk were inspirational quotes, snippets of beloved poems, and a single, faded photograph of her grandmother, a woman who had instilled in Amelia a lifelong love of words. The hum of the old-fashioned radiator and the rhythmic clatter of keyboards provided a constant, comforting soundtrack to her work.
