Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a tour guide:

**Setting:** The sprawling, sun-drenched ruins of Ephesus, Turkey. Mid-morning, late May. A haze of heat shimmered off the ancient marble streets, reflecting the intense Aegean sun. Tour groups dotted the landscape like brightly colored wildflowers, their guides waving flags and umbrellas to keep their flocks from straying. The air buzzed with a cacophony of languages, punctuated by the distant bleating of sheep grazing on the hillside.

**Story Opening:**

"And here, ladies and gentlemen," boomed a voice amplified by a small, battery-powered microphone, "we have the Library of Celsus! A magnificent testament to the Roman Empire's intellectual prowess, capable of housing over twelve thousand scrolls. Imagine..."

Professor Thaddeus Bartholomew Worthington, a tour guide with a surprisingly booming voice for his slight frame, paused for dramatic effect, a bead of sweat trickling down his forehead. He adjusted his spectacles, which were perpetually perched precariously on the bridge of his nose, and surveyed his group of twenty-something American students. Most of them were glued to their phones, taking selfies with the majestic facade as backdrop, barely registering his meticulously researched historical insights.

He sighed inwardly. Another day, another group seemingly more interested in Instagram filters than the intricacies of Roman architecture. Still, duty called. He plastered on his most enthusiastic smile and continued, "Imagine, if you will, the sheer dedication required to copy these scrolls by hand! Before the printing press, knowledge was a precious commodity, carefully guarded and meticulously preserved..."

He trailed off, noticing the glazed look in one student's eyes. This was going to be a long day. He braced himself, tightening his grip on the worn copy of his Ephesus guidebook, and wondered, not for the first time, if he should have stuck with academia. But no, academia had been stuffy, and predictable. At least here, amidst the ghosts of emperors and scholars, there was always the faint hope of discovery, of sparking a genuine interest in the past in at least *one* of his distracted charges. He just had to find the right angle. The story, the detail, the spark that would ignite their imagination...
