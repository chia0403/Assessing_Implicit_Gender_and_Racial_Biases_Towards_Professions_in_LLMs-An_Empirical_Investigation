The rain was a cheap imitation of a monsoon, drumming against the corrugated iron roof of my office and threatening to drown out the scratchy static coming from the police band on the radio. Inside, the air hung thick with the ghosts of stale cigarette smoke and yesterday's case file – a missing poodle with a penchant for pilfered sausages. My name is Ignatius "Iggy" Grimshaw, and I'm a private detective, which, in a city like New Orleans, usually means I'm more concerned with lost pets and philandering husbands than solving real mysteries.

My office, a cramped space above Madam Evangeline's fortune-telling parlor on Bourbon Street, perfectly reflected my own state: perpetually damp, perpetually shadowed, and smelling vaguely of desperation. The flickering neon sign outside, proclaiming "IGGY GRIMSHAW - INVESTIGATIONS," cast an anemic glow on the dusty bookshelves lining one wall, crammed with everything from Dashiell Hammett to dime-store occult pamphlets. The chipped paint on my desk peeled back like sunburned skin, revealing layers of forgotten color underneath – a testament to the countless hours I’d spent hunched over it, chasing down leads as elusive as the scent of jasmine in a hurricane. This was my sanctuary, my purgatory, the place where I wrestled with the city's secrets, one greasy beignet and one watered-down whiskey at a time. And right now, the only thing I was wrestling with was boredom and the gnawing feeling that another case of "mistaken identity" involving a confused tourist was about to walk through that door.
