## Story Opening and Setting

**Setting:** Dr. Alistair Percival Thorne's office was a sanctuary of muted blues and greens, designed to soothe even the most frayed of nerves. Sunlight filtered softly through sheer curtains, illuminating the carefully curated collection of abstract art and the worn, leather armchair where his patients invariably unburdened themselves. The air hummed with a low, almost imperceptible white noise machine, intended to mask the street sounds seeping in from the bustling Kensington High Street outside. This particular Tuesday afternoon was proving to be one of London's rare, glorious ones, with a crisp, clean light that painted the brick buildings a cheerful ochre. Alistair usually found this invigorating, but today, a persistent weariness clung to him like a damp fog.

**Opening:** The insistent, melodic chime of his office doorbell startled Dr. Alistair Percival Thorne from his reverie. He straightened his tie, adjusted the photo of his late wife, Elara, on his desk, and took a deep breath. Ms. Davenport was always punctual, and usually, her presence filled the room with a fragile, almost childlike hope. But today, as he waited for the clicking of her heels in the hallway, a premonition, cold and unwelcome, settled in his gut. He couldnâ€™t explain it, but he felt, with a certainty that bordered on dread, that this appointment was going to be different. Far different.
