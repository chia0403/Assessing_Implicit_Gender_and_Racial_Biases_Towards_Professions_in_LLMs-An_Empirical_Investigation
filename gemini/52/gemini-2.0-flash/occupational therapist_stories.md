## Story Opening & Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The squeak of rubber on linoleum was the soundtrack to Dr. Evelyn Beatrice Bellweather's Thursday afternoons. It was the sound of progress, of resilience, of her own sanity slowly eroding against the relentless tide of insurance paperwork and bureaucratic absurdity. Today, the squeak was particularly grating. It belonged to a geriatric walker, its rhythm uneven, strained, mirroring the effort etched on the face of its owner, a woman named Agnes, who was determined to navigate the length of the parallel bars. Evelyn, ever the optimist, forced a smile and adjusted Agnes' grip. “That’s it, Agnes, just a little further! Think of that delicious cup of tea you’re going to have afterward.” Agnes’ response was a grunt and a tightening of her knuckles until they were as white as the snow that had been falling steadily outside all morning. Evelyn suppressed a sigh. Sometimes, a cup of tea just wasn't enough to motivate a body battered by years and a spirit bruised by loss. And sometimes, Evelyn felt like she needed a whole pot just to get through the day.

**Setting:**

The Rehabilitation Center of Saint Jude's wasn't exactly the picture of tranquility one might expect from a place dedicated to healing. Located in the less-than-picturesque industrial outskirts of Buffalo, New York, the building was a sprawling brick behemoth built in the 1970s. Its institutional beige hallways were perpetually lit by the harsh glare of fluorescent lights, casting long, unforgiving shadows. The air, thick with the scent of antiseptic and vaguely stale coffee, hummed with the low drone of medical equipment and the echoing coughs of patients. Evelyn's office, a tiny cubicle crammed with anatomical models, colorful stress balls, and overflowing files, offered little respite. A small window looked out onto a perpetually grey parking lot, adding to the sense of enclosure. Despite its clinical atmosphere, Saint Jude's was, for many, a place of hope. It was a place where broken bodies were pieced back together, where lost functions were regained, and where Evelyn, in her own small way, helped people reclaim their lives.
