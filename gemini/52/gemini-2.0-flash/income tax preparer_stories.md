## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights of "Tax Solutions R Us" hummed a monotonous tune, a tune Beatrice Eleanor Plumtree had grown intimately familiar with over the last twelve years. It was the tune of desperation, of nervous calculations, and the faint, sweet melody of refunds. Beatrice, perched on her ergonomically-approved chair with the "World's Best Tax Preparer" mug warming her hands, surveyed her kingdom - a small, cramped cubicle filled with overflowing files, half-eaten granola bars, and enough tax codes to wallpaper a small country. Today, the hum felt particularly oppressive. April 14th. The day before the deadline. The day sanity fled, leaving behind a wasteland of frantic taxpayers and questionable deductions. Beatrice sighed, the sound lost in the cacophony of ringing phones and panicked muttering from her colleagues. "Just one more day," she whispered to the framed photo of her cat, Archibald, sitting regally on a velvet cushion. Archibald, at least, understood the value of a good nap and a well-documented receipt. He was, in Beatrice's humble opinion, a tax genius in disguise.

## Setting:

**Tax Solutions R Us, Suite 204, The Commerce Building, Downtown Belleville, Ohio.**

The Commerce Building was a drab, beige monolith, a testament to 1970s architectural blandness. It housed a motley crew of small businesses: a struggling insurance agency, a dusty law firm specializing in divorce settlements, a perpetually empty karate dojo, and, of course, Tax Solutions R Us. Suite 204 was located on the less desirable back side of the building, overlooking a concrete parking lot and a perpetually overflowing dumpster. The interior was just as inspiring: generic beige carpet, particleboard desks arranged in a honeycomb formation, and motivational posters featuring stock photos of smiling families who undoubtedly had someone else handle their taxes. The air was thick with the scent of cheap coffee and desperation, a cocktail that Beatrice had come to both loathe and rely on. It was, after all, the fuel that kept her going, the engine that powered her through the annual tax season inferno.
