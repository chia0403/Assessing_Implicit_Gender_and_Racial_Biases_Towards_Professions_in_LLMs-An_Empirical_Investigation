The salt spray kissed Antoine Dubois' face as he hauled the last crate of freshly caught cod onto the wobbly dock. The pre-dawn light, a bruised violet bleeding into a watery orange, painted the fishing boats in a transient, ethereal glow. He wiped a hand across his forehead, leaving a salty smear, and sighed, the sound lost in the cries of the gulls wheeling overhead. Another day, another dawn over Port de Rêves.

Port de Rêves, or "Port of Dreams" as the tourists so poetically called it, clung precariously to the rocky Breton coast. It was a town built on the bounty of the sea, a place where the wind howled secrets in the crags and the scent of brine permeated everything, from the weathered cobblestones to the threadbare carpets of Madame Moreau's cafe. The houses, a riot of faded blues and greens, huddled together for warmth, their roofs sloping sharply against the frequent gales.

Antoine himself was a fixture in Port de Rêves. At thirty-five, his face was etched with the lines of laughter and worry, his hands calloused and strong from years spent coaxing flavour from the humble ingredients the sea and the land offered. He was the heart of the kitchen at "L'Étoile de Mer" (The Sea Star), the only restaurant in town with aspirations beyond moules frites and a view that stretched all the way to the horizon. And despite the early hour and the back-aching work, he knew, deep down, that there was nowhere else he'd rather be.
