The late afternoon sun, already bleeding orange and crimson across the Chesapeake Bay, cast long, dancing shadows across the worn planks of Elias Thorne's workshop. Dust motes, disturbed by the rhythmic rasp of his plane, swam lazily in the golden light. He was a man built like the sturdy oaks he often worked with - broad-shouldered, hands calloused and strong, face weathered by years of sun and sea wind. Elias Thorne, master carpenter, was meticulously shaping a piece of cherry wood, his brow furrowed in concentration. The scent of sawdust and linseed oil hung heavy in the air, a familiar and comforting perfume that spoke of hours spent crafting beauty from raw material.

The workshop itself was a chaotic symphony of order. Tools hung neatly from pegboards, each one a gleaming extension of Elias's own hand. Half-finished projects sat patiently on workbenches - a rocking horse with a whimsical carved mane, the skeleton of a sleek sailboat, and a stack of precisely cut pieces destined to become a dining table fit for a captain's grand estate. Beyond the open double doors, the salty tang of the bay mingled with the sweet fragrance of honeysuckle climbing the weathered clapboard of the building. Elias's workshop was his sanctuary, a space where the rhythm of his craft could drown out the whispers of the past and the anxieties of the present.
