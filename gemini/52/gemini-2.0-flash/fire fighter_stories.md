## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The biting wind howled through the narrow streets of Port Blossom, Maine, a fishing town clinging precariously to the edge of the Atlantic. Salt-laced air stung exposed skin, and the scent of diesel from the returning fishing boats mingled with the ever-present aroma of woodsmoke from the century-old homes. It was early March, the time of year when the stubborn grip of winter finally started to loosen, but not before delivering one last, brutal blast.

**Story Opening:**

The shrill, relentless bleat of the fire alarm tore through the quiet of the Port Blossom Fire Station, scattering pigeons from the eaves. Lieutenant Daniel “Danny” O’Connell, mid-bite of a lukewarm ham and cheese sandwich, swore under his breath. He swallowed the half-chewed mouthful, the grainy bread sticking in his throat like sandpaper, and shoved himself up from the worn wooden table. Another kitchen fire? Elderly Mr. Higgins forgetting to turn off the stove again? He hoped so. He hoped it was anything but what his gut, hardened by years of battling flames and loss, was whispering to him: something bad. The kind of bad that clings to the soul long after the smoke clears.
