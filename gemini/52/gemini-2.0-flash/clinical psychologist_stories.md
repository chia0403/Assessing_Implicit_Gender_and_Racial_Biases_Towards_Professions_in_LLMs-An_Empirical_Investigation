## Opening:

The insistent trill of the antique telephone, a contraption Eleanor Vance still stubbornly used, sliced through the quiet hum of her consultation room. She sighed, pen hovering over the notes detailing Mrs. Hendersonâ€™s anxieties about her prize-winning begonias. Usually, Eleanor allowed her answering service to handle calls during sessions, but the number flashing across the caller ID screen was unmistakably that of her sister, Clara. An uneasy feeling, a cold tendril of dread, snaked up her spine. Clara rarely called unannounced, and never during Eleanor's work hours. Abandoning the half-finished notes, Eleanor plucked the receiver from its cradle. "Clara? Is everything alright?"

## Setting:

Dr. Eleanor Vance's office was located on the second floor of a lovingly restored Victorian house in the quiet, tree-lined neighborhood of Oakwood. It was a deliberate contrast to the sleek, sterile environments of most modern psychiatric practices. Eleanor believed that a calming, familiar setting was crucial to fostering trust and encouraging vulnerability. Sunlight streamed through the leaded glass windows, illuminating the room's muted color palette of sage green and cream. A plush Persian rug covered the polished hardwood floor, and bookshelves overflowing with well-worn copies of Freud, Jung, and more contemporary texts lined the walls. A comfortable, overstuffed armchair and a matching sofa, both upholstered in floral tapestry, faced Eleanor's mahogany desk. The scent of lavender and beeswax polish hung in the air, creating an atmosphere of quiet contemplation and genteel comfort. A single, vibrant orchid, meticulously cared for, sat on the windowsill, adding a touch of unexpected colour to the otherwise understated space. Outside, the gentle rustling of leaves and the distant chime of church bells provided a comforting backdrop to the inner turmoil often aired within its walls.
