Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a flight attendant:

**Story Opening:**

The turbulence hit harder than expected, snapping Isabelle “Izzy” Rousseau awake. Her head cracked against the overhead bin door, and a sharp, metallic tang filled her mouth – a tiny cut on her lip. Groaning, Izzy pushed herself upright, adrenaline kicking in. "Ladies and gentlemen," she announced, her voice professionally calm despite the pounding in her head, "Please remain seated with your seatbelts securely fastened. We're experiencing a bit of moderate turbulence. The captain has advised us to expect this for the next few minutes." She clipped her headset back in place, listening intently to the cockpit. The captain's voice was a low rumble, reassuring but edged with an urgency she hadn't heard before. Outside the tiny window near her jump seat, the only visible world was a churning, angry black, punctuated by the occasional flash of lightning. This wasn’t just moderate turbulence. This felt…wrong.

**Setting:**

The story takes place aboard a Boeing 777-300ER, registration number N789AL, affectionately nicknamed “The Eagle” by the crew. The flight, Albatross Airlines flight 208, departed from London Heathrow (LHR) at 14:00 GMT, bound for Los Angeles International Airport (LAX).

The interior of the aircraft is standard Albatross Airlines fare – deep teal fabric seats, accented with silver headrests and armrests. Small screens are embedded in the back of each seat, displaying the Albatross logo, a stylized white bird against a blue circle. The cabin lighting is currently dimmed for the overnight portion of the long-haul flight, casting long shadows and a slightly eerie glow.

The time is approximately 20:00 GMT, placing the flight somewhere over the vast expanse of the North Atlantic Ocean, roughly halfway between Ireland and Newfoundland. The exterior conditions are treacherous - a massive storm system, initially predicted to be avoided, has unexpectedly intensified, engulfing the plane in its turbulent embrace. The air outside is icy cold, and the plane is buffeted about as if it were a toy in a giant's hand.
