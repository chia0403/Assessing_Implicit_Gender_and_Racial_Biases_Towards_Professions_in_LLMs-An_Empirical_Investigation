## Story Opening:

The stale air in the motel room clung to Amelia Rose Davies like a shroud, a miasma of cheap cigarettes and unfulfilled dreams. She hated these places, the kind where the ice machine sounded like a dying walrus and the "continental breakfast" consisted of individually wrapped muffins of dubious origin. But the rent was cheap, and cheap was all Amelia could afford these days. Especially when chasing ghosts.

Amelia scrubbed her face with a rough motel towel, the scratchy cotton barely making a dent in the exhaustion etched around her eyes. Another dead end yesterday. Another interview with a grizzled old-timer who swore he'd seen the creature, only to contradict himself three sentences later with a rambling anecdote about alien abduction. She sighed, the sound lost in the hum of the ancient air conditioner. Was this it? Was she just destined to become another conspiracy theorist, chasing shadows in the fading light of a dying legend?

Maybe she should just pack it in, write a puff piece about the upcoming pumpkin spice latte season, and accept the soul-crushing boredom of suburban journalism. The thought was appealing, a warm bath of mediocrity. But then, the flicker of hope, the reason she was here in the first place, ignited once more in her chest. There was *something* to this story. She could feel it, a low hum of truth vibrating beneath the surface of the outlandish claims.

And Amelia Rose Davies, disgraced investigative reporter trying to claw her way back from the precipice, wasn't about to give up now.

## Setting:

The story opens in **Harmony Creek, West Virginia**, a small, isolated town nestled deep in the Appalachian Mountains. The town itself is struggling, the coal mines having long since dried up and the younger generation fleeing for opportunities elsewhere. The main street is lined with boarded-up storefronts, the only businesses thriving being the local diner, the bait and tackle shop, and, strangely enough, a thriving "crystal shop" run by a woman named Mystic Marla who claimed to be in contact with the Sasquatch itself. The surrounding landscape is dominated by dense forests, winding roads, and hidden hollows, perfect for something – or someone – to disappear into. The overall atmosphere is one of faded glory, a palpable sense of hardship, and a deep-seated suspicion of outsiders. The air hangs heavy with the scent of pine needles, damp earth, and a lingering, indefinable… *something*. Something wild.
