Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a story featuring a nutritionist:

**Story Opening:**

The aroma of burnt almonds hung heavy in the air, a bitter counterpoint to the chirping symphony of birdsong outside. Dr. Eleanor Vivian Albright, her brow furrowed like a plowed field, stared into the blackened bottom of her pan. This was not how sheâ€™d envisioned starting her Tuesday. Especially not a Tuesday where she was scheduled to deliver a keynote speech, entitled "The Art of Delicious Detoxing," to a room full of skeptical gastroenterologists.

She sighed, a sound that seemed to deflate the already precarious stack of cookbooks teetering on her countertop. Toast was out. Yogurt sounded bland. Maybe she should just grab a protein bar and resign herself to a day of politely nodding and hoping no one asked her about the latest fad diet promising immortality through kombucha enemas.

The doorbell chimed, a jarring interruption to her internal debate. Eleanor glanced at the clock. Too early for clients. Maybe it was Mrs. Henderson from next door, come to complain about the overgrown rosemary bush that threatened to engulf the sidewalk. Or worse, another zealous follower of her blog, showing up unannounced with a basket of gluten-free, sugar-free, taste-free "treats."

Hesitantly, she wiped her hands on her apron and padded towards the door, a feeling of unease settling in her stomach, a feeling that had nothing to do with the prospect of a burnt-almond-free breakfast.

**Setting:**

Eleanor Albright's kitchen is the heart of her brownstone apartment in Brooklyn Heights. It's a space that reflects her professional life: impeccably organized, but with a touch of lived-in charm. Stainless steel appliances gleam against the backdrop of exposed brick. Shelves overflowing with cookbooks, jars of spices, and artisanal grains line the walls. A large butcher block island dominates the center of the room, often covered with fresh produce and culinary experiments. Sunlight streams in through the large bay window, illuminating a small herb garden thriving on the sill. Despite the occasional burnt almond incident, it's a warm and inviting space, designed for both creating nutritious meals and sharing them with loved ones. The rest of her apartment is similarly styled, balancing modern functionality with the historic charm of the brownstone.
