The biting wind, smelling of pine needles and wet earth, whipped around Silas Blackwood's thick beard, tugging at the edges. He squinted against the low-hanging, bruised-purple clouds, a permanent crinkle etched around his deep-set eyes from years of battling the unpredictable moods of the Pacific Northwest. The Clatsop County forest, his office and his nemesis, stretched before him in a chaotic tapestry of towering Douglas firs, hemlocks, and stubborn undergrowth. This particular patch, affectionately nicknamed "The Devil's Elbow" by the crew, was notoriously unforgiving. The trees grew impossibly close together, their roots tangled in a spiderweb of rock and mud, making felling them a perilous game. Silas, however, felt strangely at peace here. The symphony of creaking branches and the rhythmic chug of his chainsaw were the only music he needed. It was a hard life, logging, but it was *his* life, carved from the same unforgiving landscape that tested him every day.
