The biting wind, a relentless sculptor of the high plains, whipped at Jedediah "Jed" Armstrong's weathered face as he surveyed his herd. Sunrise bled across the horizon, painting the snow-dusted peaks of the Absaroka Range a fiery pink. Steam billowed from the nostrils of the cattle, each breath a small rebellion against the frigid air. Jed’s breath, too, plumed white, mirroring their defiance.

He stood on the porch of the main house of the Armstrong Ranch, a sprawling spread carved into the unforgiving landscape of Montana, a testament to generations of grit and stubbornness. The house itself was a rambling affair, patched together over the years with logs and rough-hewn planks, a patchwork quilt of necessity and resilience. The low sun glinted off the snow-covered roofs of the outbuildings - the barn, the bunkhouse, the blacksmith shop – all silent witnesses to the daily grind of ranch life. The air, sharp and clean, carried the scent of pine and woodsmoke, a familiar comfort in this vast, often lonely, domain. Jedediah knew, with a certainty that ran deeper than his blood, that winter was here to stay for a while. And winter, on the Armstrong Ranch, was always a fight.
