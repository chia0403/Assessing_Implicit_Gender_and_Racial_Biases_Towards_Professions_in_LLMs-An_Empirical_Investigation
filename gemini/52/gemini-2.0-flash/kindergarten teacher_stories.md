The scent of Elmer's glue and orange slices hung heavy in the air, a fragrant battle fought and usually won in Room 12, otherwise known as the vibrant heart of Ms. Evangeline Beatrice Hawthorne's kindergarten kingdom. Sunlight, fractured by paper snowflakes haphazardly taped to the window, danced across the linoleum floor, spotting the scattered collection of mismatched chairs and tiny tables like confetti. It was almost ten o'clock, the frantic energy of drop-off a distant echo, replaced by the relative calm that descended after Story Time – a calm that, Evangeline knew from years of experience, was the deceptive eye of the storm.

Evangeline, perched precariously on a child-sized stool, meticulously reconstructed the leaning tower of building blocks, a frown etched onto her usually cheerful face. Her chestnut hair, pulled back into a practical, low ponytail, threatened to escape its confines. The tiny handprints smudged across the blocks were a testament to the morning's constructive (and sometimes destructive) efforts. Today was Friday, which meant the children were extra wiggly, their attention spans shorter than a crayon stub, and the promise of the weekend hung in the air like an untied balloon, ready to float away. And somewhere, lost in the chaos, was Timmy’s missing sock puppet, Mr. Snuggles, and until Mr. Snuggles was found, peace wouldn't reign in Room 12.
