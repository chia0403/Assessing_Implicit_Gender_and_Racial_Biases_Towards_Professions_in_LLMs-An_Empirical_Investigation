Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a story featuring a physical therapist named:

**Name:**  Eleanor Grace McKinley

**Opening:**

The smell of disinfectant hung thick in the air, clinging to Eleanor Grace McKinley's nostrils like a persistent cough. It was a smell she both loathed and found strangely comforting – a constant reminder of her purpose, of the tangible difference she made in the lives of others.  But today, even the familiar antiseptic couldn't mask the simmering tension that crackled in the small, brightly lit rehabilitation room.  Mr. Henderson, her most stubborn (and arguably, her most rewarding) patient, was digging in his heels. Again.

"I told you, Ellie, I'm done with the damn leg press," he huffed, his face flushed a mottled red. "It ain't doing a lick of good. Feels like I'm hauling the whole damn mountain range."

Eleanor sighed, smoothing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear.  "Mr. Henderson, we've been over this. You've made significant progress. Last week you could barely manage five pounds, now you're at fifteen. Your quads are getting stronger, your stability is improving…"

"Stronger?  I feel like I'm gonna snap in half like a dry twig!"  He crossed his arms over his chest, a defiant glint in his eyes.  Eleanor knew this battle well. It was part stubbornness, part fear, and a whole lot of frustration that he couldn’t just be back out fly-fishing, like he was before the accident.  She just needed to find the right angle, the right way to coax him back on board.  Because despite the bluster, she knew he wanted this just as much as she did.  He just didn't want to feel like he was failing.

**Setting:**

The story is primarily set in **"Sunrise Rehabilitation Center,"** a mid-sized outpatient physical therapy clinic located in the small, mountain town of **Aspen Creek, Colorado.**

*   **Exterior:** The clinic is a single-story building with large windows overlooking a stunning panorama of the snow-capped Rocky Mountains. The building is relatively modern, with tan brick and dark green trim, but attempts have been made to blend it with the rustic aesthetic of Aspen Creek.  There's a small parking lot out front, often filled with trucks and SUVs, reflecting the outdoorsy nature of the community.

*   **Interior:** The clinic is divided into several sections:

    *   **Reception Area:**  Warm and inviting, with comfortable seating, brochures about various therapies, and a fish tank bubbling quietly in the corner.  Local artwork depicting mountain landscapes adorns the walls.

    *   **Individual Treatment Rooms:** Small, private rooms with exam tables, various therapeutic tools (ultrasound machines, electrical stimulation devices, etc.), and motivational posters.

    *   **Main Rehabilitation Room:** This is where the action primarily takes place. It's a larger, open space filled with exercise equipment: treadmills, stationary bikes, weight machines, resistance bands, balance boards, and mats.  The large windows offer breathtaking views, but they also provide ample natural light that highlights every speck of dust and imperfection.

    *   **Staff Room:** A small, cramped space with a coffee maker, microwave, and bulletin board overflowing with patient photos, inspirational quotes, and reminders about continuing education requirements. It's the hub where Eleanor and her colleagues often gather to strategize, vent, and support each other.

Aspen Creek itself is a key element of the setting. It's a tight-knit community where everyone knows everyone, and the rugged mountain environment plays a significant role in the residents' lives. The local population is a mix of long-time residents, ski enthusiasts, and retirees seeking peace and quiet. The town's proximity to nature is both a source of healing and a potential cause of injuries, making the rehabilitation center a vital part of the community.
