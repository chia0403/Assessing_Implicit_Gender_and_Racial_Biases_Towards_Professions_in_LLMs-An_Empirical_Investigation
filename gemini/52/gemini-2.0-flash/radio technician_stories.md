**Opening:**

The insistent buzz, a high-pitched whine that resonated deep in Elias Thorne's bones, was not the comforting hum of well-tuned vacuum tubes he usually coaxed from vintage radios. This was something else entirely. Something...wrong. He squinted at the digital display of his spectrum analyzer, the green squiggles dancing erratically across the screen like panicked fireflies. It was a foreign signal, bleeding in from somewhere beyond the usual FM static and crackling AM broadcasts. A signal that felt… deliberate.

**Setting:**

Elias's workshop, "Thorne's Amplified Antiquities," was crammed into a converted garage behind his Victorian-era house in the small, almost forgotten, town of Havenwood, Vermont. Havenwood was a place where time seemed to move slower, where rotary phones still graced some kitchen walls, and where the only industry seemed to be catering to the trickle of tourists who came to admire the fall foliage. The shop itself was a chaotic symphony of discarded electronics and carefully curated treasures. Shelves groaned under the weight of antique radios - cathedral radios, console radios, even a rare Atwater Kent Model 20. Disemboweled radios lay on his workbench, exposing their intricate innards like anatomical diagrams. Tools of every conceivable size and purpose were scattered around – soldering irons, wire strippers, multimeters, and enough screwdrivers to assemble a small army. The air was thick with the nostalgic scent of warmed-up tubes, rosin core solder, and a faint undercurrent of dust that had settled undisturbed for decades. Sunlight struggled to penetrate the grime-coated windows, casting long, amber shadows across the room. Outside, the wind whispered through the tall pines, carrying the lonely cry of a distant train – a sound Elias had always found comforting, until now. Now, it felt like a warning.
