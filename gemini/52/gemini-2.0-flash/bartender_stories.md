Okay, here's a story opening and setting:

**Story Opening:**

The clatter of glasses against polished mahogany was the only sound that truly soothed Bartholomew "Bart" Fitzgerald, a sound as familiar and comforting as his own heartbeat. He leaned against the back bar of The Serpent's Coil, idly polishing a highball glass until it gleamed under the low, amber light. It was nearing 1 AM, the tail end of a Thursday night, and the usual cacophony of drunken laughter and boisterous conversation had simmered down to a low hum. Only a few regulars remained, nursing their last drinks and trading hushed stories, their faces illuminated by the flickering candles scattered across the tables. Bart watched them, a silent observer in their world, a weary smile playing on his lips. He knew their stories, their hopes, their regrets, as well as he knew the recipes for a perfect Old Fashioned or a potent Zombie. He was, after all, more than just a bartender; he was a confidant, a therapist, and sometimes, even a friend. Tonight, though, even the comfort of the familiar couldn't quite dispel the knot of unease that had been tightening in his chest all day. Something felt different. Something was coming.

**Setting:**

The Serpent's Coil was a dimly lit, intimate cocktail bar nestled in the heart of New Orleans' French Quarter. Its walls were painted a deep, velvety crimson, adorned with antique mirrors and quirky, unsettling artwork - mostly portraits of enigmatic figures with piercing eyes and unsettling smiles. The bar itself was a long, imposing stretch of dark mahogany, worn smooth by years of use, its surface etched with countless rings from forgotten drinks and whispered secrets. Above it hung a collection of antique, mismatched chandeliers, casting a warm, yet subdued light that danced across the room. In the back, a raised platform served as a makeshift stage, where a jazz band occasionally played, filling the space with melancholic tunes. The air was thick with the scent of aged whiskey, exotic spices, and a hint of something indefinably…old. It was a place steeped in history, a haven for those seeking refuge from the chaos of the outside world, and a magnet for the city's more eccentric characters. Outside, the sounds of the French Quarter – the distant wail of a saxophone, the clip-clop of horse-drawn carriages, the murmur of conversations – were muffled, creating a sense of isolation and intrigue.
