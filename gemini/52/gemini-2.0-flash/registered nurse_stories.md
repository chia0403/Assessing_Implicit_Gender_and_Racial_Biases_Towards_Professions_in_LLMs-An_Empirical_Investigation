## Story Opening:

The sterile hum of the IV pump was the only sound accompanying the rhythmic beeping of the heart monitor. Eleanor Margaret Hayes, RN, meticulously adjusted the flow rate, her brow furrowed with concentration. Outside, the early morning light was a pale, watery grey, barely piercing the grime that clung to the windows of the ICU. The city was just waking up, stretching and groaning like a reluctant giant, but inside Unit B, the war against sickness never slept. Eleanor sighed, a plume of warmth puffing against the cool air as she leaned closer to her patient, Mrs. Petrov, her breathing shallow and laboured. "Come on, sweetheart," she murmured, her voice a soft counterpoint to the mechanical symphony of the machines. "Just breathe for me."

## Setting:

The story takes place in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of **Saint Jude's Hospital** in downtown **Detroit, Michigan**. It is early **November**, a time of year where the chill seeps into everything, and the grey skies seem to mirror the anxieties that permeate the hospital walls. Saint Jude's is a large, older hospital, known for serving a diverse and often under-served population. The ICU itself is cramped and utilitarian, a stark contrast to the hopeful promises whispered in the hallways. The walls are painted a faded, institutional green, and the air is thick with the scent of antiseptic and fear. Despite its sterile environment, the ICU is a place of intense emotion, where life and death dance a daily tango, and where nurses like Eleanor bear witness to the human spirit's incredible resilience and heartbreaking fragility.
