The pre-dawn air hung thick and heavy, tasting of diesel fumes and damp earth. A lone cricket chirped its persistent song, a tiny counterpoint to the guttural rumble emanating from the Peterbilt 379 parked outside the diner. Rain had slicked the blacktop of Interstate 40 just west of Oklahoma City, painting the neon signs of the "Big T Truck Stop" in blurred, shimmering hues. Inside, the clatter of plates and the low murmur of conversations battled with the tinny twang of a country song spilling from a cracked speaker.

This was Delores "Dee" McKinley's usual haunt before another long haul. She sat hunched over a chipped Formica table, the red glow of the "Open 24 Hours" sign reflecting in her weary eyes. Delores, a woman built like a weathered oak, with hands calloused from years of gripping a steering wheel, drained the last of her lukewarm coffee. The caffeine did little to combat the bone-deep fatigue that came with crisscrossing the country, but it was a ritual, a small comfort before she climbed back into the metal and glass cage that was her livelihood. This time, it was a load of frozen shrimp headed for Denver. Another week, another thousand miles. Another song on the road.
