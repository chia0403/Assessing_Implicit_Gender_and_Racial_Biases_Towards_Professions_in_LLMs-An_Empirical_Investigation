## Story Opening:

The insistent hum of the fluorescent lights was the first thing that assaulted Arthur Penhaligon's senses each morning. He'd grown so accustomed to it over the past seven years that he barely registered it anymore, much like the beige monotony of his cubicle and the stale coffee perpetually brewing in the communal pot. But this morning, the hum felt particularly grating, a discordant symphony to the swirling anxiety churning in his gut. He pulled at the knot of his tie, a futile attempt to loosen the invisible band tightening around his chest. Today was presentation day. Today, his redesign for the Westlake Bridge, the project he'd poured his heart and soul into for the past six months, would be unveiled to the city council. And today, Arthur felt less like a confident structural draftsman and more like a man about to walk the plank.

## Setting:

The setting is the sprawling, labyrinthine offices of "Everett & Sons Civil Engineering," located on the 12th floor of a glass-and-steel skyscraper in downtown Milltown. The building itself is a monument to utilitarian modernism, all clean lines and impersonal efficiency. Arthur's cubicle, a small, partitioned space nestled amongst a sea of identical workstations, is crammed with technical drawings, architectural models in various stages of completion, and overflowing stacks of blueprints held together with rubber bands. Sunlight, filtered through the tinted windows, cast a pale, ethereal glow over the room, highlighting the dust motes dancing in the air. The air is thick with the scent of toner, stale coffee, and the faint, lingering aroma of desperation. Through the narrow opening of his cubicle, Arthur can glimpse a panorama of the city below â€“ a concrete jungle punctuated by the silvery ribbon of the Milltown River, and the very bridge he has dedicated his life to improving.
