## Story Opening:

The scent of eucalyptus and stale sweat hung heavy in the air of the clinic. Dr. Eleanor Rose Thorne kneaded the tight knot of muscle at the base of Mr. Henderson's neck, her own back protesting in silent sympathy. "Alright, Mr. Henderson," she said, her voice soothing despite the slight strain. "Just a little bit more pressure here, and then we'll see if we can get some of that tension to release."

Mr. Henderson, a retired mailman with a perpetually hunched posture, groaned in what could have been either pain or pleasure. "You're a miracle worker, Dr. Thorne. A miracle worker, I tell ya."

Eleanor chuckled, a dry, brittle sound. "I just put things back where they belong, Mr. Henderson. Gravity and bad habits do the rest of the damage."

She adjusted her grip, focusing on the subtle shifts beneath her fingertips. Despite her weariness - the clinic had been packed all day, each patient a testament to the city's increasingly sedentary lifestyle - Eleanor found a sliver of satisfaction in the work. The immediate, tangible relief she could provide was a small, constant comfort in a world that often felt overwhelmingly broken. But lately, the comfort had been fading, replaced by a gnawing sense of unease. Something felt off, a dissonance she couldn't quite pinpoint. It was like a misplaced vertebra, a subtle misalignment that threw the whole body into disarray.

## Setting:

The story is primarily set in "Thorne Chiropractic," a small, modestly furnished clinic located in the heart of the bustling, revitalizing neighborhood of *Northwood* in the fictional city of *Oakhaven*. The building itself is a converted brownstone, its original charm visible in the ornate cornices and the leaded glass windows, though the interior has been modernized with clean lines and muted colours.

* **The treatment room:** Where Eleanor spends most of her time, it features an adjustable chiropractic table, a wall-mounted skeletal model, and framed anatomical charts. A calming landscape print hangs above the table, a weak attempt to bring a touch of nature into the sterile environment. The air purifier hums quietly in the corner, battling the persistent scent of liniment and essential oils.

* **The reception area:** A small, brightly lit space dominated by a worn, comfortable armchair and a meticulously organized reception desk. Magazines are neatly stacked, and a small water cooler gurgles periodically. The walls are adorned with patient testimonials and before-and-after photos, showcasing Eleanor's success stories.

Beyond the clinic, the neighborhood of Northwood is experiencing a rapid gentrification, a stark contrast to its formerly blue-collar roots. Trendy cafes and artisanal bakeries are popping up alongside the older, more established businesses, creating a dynamic, sometimes uneasy, mix of old and new. The wider city of Oakhaven is a sprawling metropolis with a complex history, a vibrant cultural scene, and a simmering undercurrent of secrets.
