## Story Opening:

The asphalt shimmered under the relentless August sun, mimicking the heat haze shimmering off the hood of Dale Edgar Pritchard's beat-up Ford pickup. Dale squinted, the glare bouncing off his safety vest almost blinding him. He spat a stream of tobacco juice into the weedy verge, the sound swallowed by the drone of passing eighteen-wheelers. Another scorcher. He'd already emptied his water jug twice, and it wasn't even noon.

A bead of sweat trickled down his temple, tracing a path through the grime and dust already caked on his skin. He wiped it with the back of his hand, leaving a greasy smear. He loved the open road, he truly did. But days like this, when the air hung thick and heavy like wet wool, made him question his life choices. Made him question everything.

The radio crackled, a voice cutting through the low hum of boredom. "Maintenance Crew Unit 4, Maintenance Crew Unit 4, we got a report of debris on Highway 17, mile marker 32 westbound. Proceed with caution."

Dale sighed. Debris. That could mean anything from a stray tire to a shredded deer carcass. Either way, it meant more time baking in this inferno. He grabbed his hard hat from the passenger seat, pulling it low over his brow. "Alright," he muttered to himself, starting the engine. "Let's get this over with."

## Setting:

The story is set in the rural, sun-baked landscape of **Western Texas**, specifically along **Highway 17**, a long, desolate stretch of road cutting through dusty plains and occasional scrubland. The highway is relatively busy with trucks hauling goods across the state, but pockets of isolation are common, especially further away from the small towns that dot the landscape.

The season is **late August**, the peak of summer heat. The air is dry and still, broken only by the occasional gust of wind that whips up dust devils across the barren fields. The color palette is dominated by shades of brown and beige, with the occasional splash of green from hardy desert plants clinging to life.

Dale's **Ford pickup** is his office and lifeline. It's an older model, dented and scratched from years of hard use, but it's reliable enough. Inside, it smells of stale coffee, tobacco, and sweat. Tools are scattered across the back, alongside a well-worn first-aid kit and a box of granola bars.

The landscape is unforgiving, a constant reminder of the raw power of nature. It's a place where people learn to be self-sufficient, to rely on their own grit and determination to survive. And for Dale Edgar Pritchard, a man who knows the road like the back of his hand, it's home.
