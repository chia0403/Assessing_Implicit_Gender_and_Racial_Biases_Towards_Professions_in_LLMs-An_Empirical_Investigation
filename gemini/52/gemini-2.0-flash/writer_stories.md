The clatter of the antique Olivetti Lettera 32 was a familiar lullaby to Elara Jane Ashworth. She sat hunched in her threadbare armchair, the scent of old paper and Earl Grey tea clinging to the air around her like a comforting shroud. Outside, the relentless Cornish wind howled, lashing rain against the cracked panes of her cottage window.

The setting was 'The Writer's Retreat,' a crumbling stone cottage perched precariously on the edge of a windswept cliff overlooking the turbulent Atlantic. Elara had inherited the place from her eccentric Aunt Mabel, a woman who’d written pulp romances and filled the garden with unsettlingly lifelike gnomes. The cottage was damp, drafty, and decidedly haunted - by seagulls, at least - but it offered Elara the solitude she desperately craved.

Inside, the room was a chaotic symphony of creativity. Books teetered on precarious stacks, threatening to avalanche onto the floor at any moment. Maps of fantastical lands, sketched on parchment and stained with coffee, adorned the walls alongside faded photographs of Elara's aunt, usually posing with a beaming smile and an unusually large gnome. A half-eaten scone sat forgotten on a saucer, attracting the attention of a bold and particularly persistent housefly.

Elara rubbed her tired eyes and stared at the half-finished manuscript in the typewriter. A week. She’d been holed up here for a week, attempting to resurrect her writing career after a particularly nasty bout of writer's block, and all she had to show for it was a page and a half of meandering prose and a growing feeling that she was being judged by a colony of garden gnomes. Tonight, the deadline loomed. Tonight, she needed to deliver something, anything, to her perpetually disappointed editor.
