The biting wind whipped off the Labrador Sea, clawing at Dr. Anya Petrova’s exposed cheeks as she wrestled with the stubborn latch on the door of the research outpost. Snow, fine and crystalline, stung her eyes, momentarily blinding her to the already bleak landscape. This far north, at the edge of Ungava Bay, the sun was a fleeting memory this time of year, a dull orange smudge painting the horizon for maybe an hour before plunging back into the oppressive gloom.

Anya finally managed to pry the door open, the hinges groaning in protest like ancient, frozen bones. She ducked inside, the relative warmth of the small, prefabricated structure a balm against the brutal Arctic air. The hum of the generator, the lifeblood of the station, filled the tiny space, a reassuring constant in this desolate realm. Her breath plumed in front of her, dissipating slowly in the close air, which carried the faint scent of disinfectant and stale coffee.

This was Station Echo, a lonely outpost perched precariously on the rocky coastline of the Torngat Mountains. Anya had been here for six weeks already, a stint that felt more like six years. She was a marine biologist, specializing in the effects of climate change on deep-sea benthic ecosystems. And right now, those ecosystems – and the bizarre anomalies they were exhibiting – were the only things keeping her from completely losing her mind to the crushing solitude and the endless, gnawing cold.
