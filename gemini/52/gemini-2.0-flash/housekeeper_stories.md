The scent of lemon and lavender hung heavy in the air, a fragrant shield against the lingering ghosts of last night's debauchery. Agnes Petunia Featherstone, a woman built like a sturdy oak tree and armed with a disarming smile, sighed and surveyed the battlefield. Champagne flutes lay scattered like fallen soldiers, velvet cushions were askew, and a single, forlorn feather boa lay draped across a grand piano, looking thoroughly exhausted. This was the aftermath of a particularly raucous gala at Windhaven Manor, a sprawling estate perched precariously on the cliffs overlooking the wild Cornish sea.

Windhaven Manor belonged to the flamboyant and endlessly eccentric Sir Alistair Blackwood, a retired opera singer with a penchant for dramatic entrances and even more dramatic parties. Agnes had been his housekeeper for fifteen years, weathering every storm – both literal and metaphorical – that the Blackwood household could throw at her. She’d seen everything from stray peacocks roosting in the chandelier to lost emerald necklaces turning up in the biscuit tin.

Today, however, felt different. There was a faint, unsettling hum beneath the surface of the usual post-party chaos, a feeling that prickled the back of Agnes's neck. It wasn't just the mess; it was a sense of…absence. Sir Alistair hadn't come down for his usual morning coffee, and his bedroom door remained stubbornly closed. Agnes, armed with her duster and a growing sense of unease, decided it was time to investigate. The silence emanating from the upper floors was almost as unnerving as the cacophony from the night before. This morning, at Windhaven Manor, silence felt…suspicious.
