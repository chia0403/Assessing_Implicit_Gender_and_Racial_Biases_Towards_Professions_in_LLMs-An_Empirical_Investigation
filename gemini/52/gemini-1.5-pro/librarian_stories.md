The scent of aging paper and leather soothed Elias Thorne like a lullaby.  He inhaled deeply, the familiar aroma a comforting counterpoint to the incessant drumming of rain against the tall, arched windows of the Athelney Library.  Nestled in the heart of the ancient, sprawling university town of Oxbridge, the Athelney wasn't just a library; it was a sanctuary, a labyrinth of knowledge, and Elias's kingdom.  Outside, a November gale howled through the narrow, cobbled streets, bending the gas lamps and whipping fallen leaves into frantic dances. Inside, the air was still and hushed, punctuated only by the occasional soft creak of a chair or the rustle of turning pages.  Elias, perched on a rolling ladder in the dimly lit History alcove, adjusted his spectacles and resumed his meticulous cataloging of a newly acquired collection of 18th-century pamphlets on the burgeoning science of ballooning. The world outside, with its rush and clamor, felt a million miles away.
