The rusty scissors, affectionately nicknamed "Snippy" by Elias Thorne, whispered against the worn leather of his barber's strop.  The rhythmic rasp was a familiar morning song in the tiny barbershop, nestled between a perpetually dusty antique shop and Mrs. Higgins' perpetually bustling bakery, its sugary aroma a constant companion. Elias, a man whose neatly trimmed salt-and-pepper beard mirrored the precise lines he carved into his clients' hair, inhaled deeply, a mixture of yeasty sweetness and the metallic tang of his tools filling his lungs.  The sleepy town of Havenwood, nestled in the rolling hills of the Vermont countryside, was just beginning to stir, but inside Thorne's Tonsorial Parlour, the day had already begun.  Sunlight, filtered through the large front window, illuminated swirling motes of dust dancing in the air, highlighting the faded glory of the shopâ€™s mahogany chairs and the chipped porcelain sink.  This morning, however, the air held a different kind of anticipation, a subtle static hum Elias couldn't quite place.
