The biting November wind howled down Ashworth Avenue, whipping fallen leaves into frenzied spirals around Elias Thorne's ankles. He hunched deeper into his threadbare coat, the collar scratching against the stubble on his neck.

He shifted his toolbox – a battered metal behemoth he’d inherited from his grandfather – from one hand to the other. Inside, a rogue pipe was performing a mournful, watery solo, a sound that echoed the hollow ache in Elias’s own gut.  This was the third call-out of the day, each one a variation on the same theme: old houses, crumbling infrastructure, and the unending struggle against the creeping damp of a Manchester winter.
