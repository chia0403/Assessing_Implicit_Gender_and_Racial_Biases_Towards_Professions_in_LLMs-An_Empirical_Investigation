The biting wind whipped across the skeletal steel frame of the "Skyreach" tower, whistling a mournful tune through the gaps where glass panes would eventually glimmer. Fifty stories below, the Chicago River snaked through the city like a ribbon of pewter under a bruised, pre-dawn sky.  Patches of frost clung to the metal beams, crunching under the heavy work boots of Elias Vance, as he made his way along a narrow I-beam, his tool belt clinking rhythmically against his hip.  Elias, a man built like the girders he walked on – broad-shouldered, thick-handed, with a face weathered by sun and grit –  paused at the edge, peering down into the dizzying chasm.  Another day, another dizzying height.  He took a deep breath, the icy air burning in his lungs, and prepared to begin his work.  The city below was still mostly asleep, unaware of the men who danced with gravity hundreds of feet above, slowly piecing together its future skyline.
