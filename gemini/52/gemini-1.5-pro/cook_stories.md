The clatter of pots and pans was Amelia "Amy" Bouchard's morning symphony.  Dawn painted the sky a bruised plum colour above the rolling hills of County Clare, Ireland, and the kitchen of The Rusty Kettle pub was already thick with the aroma of frying bacon and brewing tea.  Amy, her fiery red hair escaping from beneath a stained bandana, hummed along to a mournful Gaelic ballad crackling from the battered radio perched on a shelf above the ancient Aga stove. The Rusty Kettle wasn't much to look at from the outside, its paint peeling and the sign swinging precariously in the ever-present Atlantic breeze. But inside, it was a haven of warmth and hearty food, a testament to Amy's culinary skill and unwavering dedication to keeping the spirit of her grandmother's legacy alive.  The pub, passed down through generations of Bouchard women, was more than just a business; it was a piece of her heart, a tangible link to a past she fiercely cherished. This morning, however, a different kind of tension hung in the air, a stillness that hinted at something beyond the usual quiet before the morning rush.
