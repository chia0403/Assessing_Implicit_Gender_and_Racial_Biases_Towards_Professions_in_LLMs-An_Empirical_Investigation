Rain lashed against the stained-glass peacock that adorned the front window of The Gilded Lily, turning the streetlights outside into hazy halos. Inside, the air was thick with the aroma of stale beer, cheap whiskey, and regret.  Behind the mahogany bar, polished to a high sheen despite years of neglect, stood Elias Vance, meticulously wiping down a shot glass. His dark hair, usually slicked back, was beginning to curl with the humidity, and the faint lines around his eyes deepened as he surveyed the handful of patrons scattered around the dimly lit space. The Gilded Lily, nestled in the heart of the once-glamorous, now-decaying port town of Aethel, had seen better days, much like Elias himself.  Tonight, like most nights, the silence was punctuated only by the clinking of ice and the mournful groan of a saxophone solo bleeding from the jukebox in the corner.  Something was different tonight, though. Elias could feel it, a prickle on the back of his neck, a subtle shift in the stagnant air. He couldn't put his finger on it, but he knew, with the unshakeable certainty of a seasoned bartender, that tonight was going to be a night to remember.
