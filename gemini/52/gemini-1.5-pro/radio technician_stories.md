The flickering neon sign of the "Starlight Diner" cast a sickly green glow across the rain-slicked asphalt of Highway 17. Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of stale coffee and frying onions.  Eleanor Vance, her callsign "Sparky" stitched onto the pocket of her worn denim jacket, hunched over a mess of wires and vacuum tubes sprawled across one of the diner's sticky Formica tables. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, rattling the windows and intermittently cutting out the crackling broadcast from the portable radio she was desperately trying to repair.  It was 2:17 AM in the desolate stretch of Nevada desert between Reno and Elko, and the only other occupant of the diner was a taciturn trucker nursing a bottomless cup of coffee and staring out at the storm.  The radio, Eleanorâ€™s only link to the outside world and the crucial weather updates she needed, was stubbornly refusing to cooperate.  A low rumble of thunder vibrated through the floor, and the lights in the diner flickered once, twice, then died, plunging Eleanor and the trucker into near darkness.
