The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of Wyoming, rattling the windows of Dr. Eleanor Vanceâ€™s veterinary clinic.  Snow, driven almost horizontal by the gale, plastered against the glass, obscuring the already fading light of the late December afternoon. Inside, the clinic was warm and smelled of disinfectant and vaguely of wet dog. Eleanor, her auburn hair pulled back in a messy bun, knelt beside a whimpering Labrador, gently palpating its swollen leg. The only other sound besides the dog's whimpers and the howling wind was the crackling of the aged wood stove in the corner, fighting a losing battle against the encroaching cold.  Dust Devils, the nearest town, was a thirty-mile drive across treacherous roads, and tonight, it felt further than ever.
