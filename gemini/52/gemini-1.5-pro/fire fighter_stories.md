The biting November wind whipped around Captain Elias "Eli" Thorne, stinging his cheeks and tearing at the loose edges of the yellow caution tape that cordoned off Mrs. Petrov's dilapidated Victorian.  Ice crusted the skeletal branches of the ancient elm that loomed over the property, casting long, skeletal shadows across the frost-covered lawn.  The air reeked of charred wood and damp earth, the lingering perfume of a fire that had raged just hours before, leaving the once-grand house a blackened husk.  Beacon Hill, typically a picture of Bostonian elegance with its gas lamps and brick sidewalks, now wore a grim and sooty veil.  Eli shifted his weight, the crunch of frozen leaves beneath his heavy boots the only sound besides the distant wail of a returning fire engine. Dawn was just beginning to paint the eastern sky a bruised purple, offering little warmth against the pre-winter chill. He knew this wouldn't be a quick clean-up. Not with the way the fire had burrowed into the old bones of the house.  And not with the nagging feeling in his gut that something about this fire wasn't right.
