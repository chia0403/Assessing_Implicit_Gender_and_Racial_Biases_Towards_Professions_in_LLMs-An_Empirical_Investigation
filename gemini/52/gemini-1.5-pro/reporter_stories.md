The biting wind whipped Amelia "Millie" Reyes's auburn hair across her face as she stared at the dilapidated lighthouse, its white paint peeling like sunburnt skin.  Perched precariously on the cliff edge, it overlooked the churning grey expanse of the North Atlantic, a sentinel against the encroaching gloom.  Salt spray kissed her cheeks, a constant reminder of the isolated nature of Monhegan Island, twelve miles off the coast of Maine.  October had clawed its way in, leaving the island skeletal and bare, the summer tourists long gone, replaced by a gnawing quiet that settled deep in the bones. Millie, a reporter for the Portland Gazette, hadn’t come to Monhegan for the stark beauty, though. She’d come for a story, a story whispered in hushed tones by the island’s remaining inhabitants, a story of a disappearance, a curse, and a light that never went out.
