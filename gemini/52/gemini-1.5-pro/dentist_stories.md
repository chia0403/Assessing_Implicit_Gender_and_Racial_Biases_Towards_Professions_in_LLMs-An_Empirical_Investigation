The biting November wind howled around the eaves of Dr. Elias Thorne's dental practice, rattling the frosted panes of the large bay window that showcased his meticulously arranged collection of antique tooth keys.  His practice, nestled in the heart of Port Blossom, Maine, a town clinging to the rocky coastline like a barnacle, had seen better days.  The once-vibrant fishing port, with its colorful houses perched precariously on the cliffs, now felt worn and weathered, mirroring the dwindling population. Elias, like the town, felt the bite of time and the chill of isolation creeping in. The rhythmic clang of the harbor bell, usually a comforting sound, tonight felt more like a mournful dirge.
