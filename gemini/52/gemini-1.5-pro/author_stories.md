The salt spray kissed Amelia Grace Hawthorne's face as she leaned against the weathered railing of her seaside cottage.

The wind howled a mournful ballad, a soundtrack to the writer's block that had plagued her for the past six months.  Amelia, a renowned author of gothic romances, was facing the daunting blank page of her next novel, a tale of a shipwrecked sailor and the mysterious woman who saved him.  The Cornish sea, usually her muse, now offered only a cold, unyielding silence.  The deadline loomed, a dark cloud on the horizon of her otherwise idyllic existence.
