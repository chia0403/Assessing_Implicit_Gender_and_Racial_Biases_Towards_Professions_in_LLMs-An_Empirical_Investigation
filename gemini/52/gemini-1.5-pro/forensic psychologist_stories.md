The biting wind whipped off the Puget Sound, carrying the scent of salt and damp earth through the open window of Dr. Elias Thorne’s office.

Tonight, however, the harbor was a churning mass of whitecaps, mirroring the turmoil brewing within him. A half-eaten sandwich sat forgotten on his desk beside a thick file stamped with the stark black letters: CASE #724 - THE WHISPER KILLER.
