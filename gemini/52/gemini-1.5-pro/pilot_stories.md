The biting Alaskan wind whipped at Amelia “Ace” Reyes’s flight jacket, the nylon snapping like a startled raven.  Glacier-carved peaks, dusted with fresh snow, clawed at the bruised twilight sky above the Denali National Park airstrip.  A single, flickering gas lamp cast a sickly yellow halo around the ramshackle office, its plywood siding groaning under the relentless gusts.  Ace, her breath misting in the frigid air, checked the tie-downs on her De Havilland Beaver one last time, the metal cold against her gloved fingers.  This was her last supply run to the remote McKinley Gold Mine before the real winter set in, and the thought of navigating the treacherous mountain passes in the approaching darkness gnawed at her.  The radio crackled to life, a gruff voice cutting through the static, "Ace, you copy? Blizzard's rolling in faster than expected.  You gotta haul tail if you're gonna make it back tonight."
