The scent of Elmer's glue and stale apple juice hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume Miss Amelia Juniper considered the essence of kindergarten.  Sunlight, fractured by the colorful paper butterflies taped to the windowpane, splashed across the linoleum floor of Room 3B, illuminating scattered building blocks and a rogue, glittery pom-pom that had escaped its designated art project. Outside, the October wind rustled the leaves of the ancient oak that stood sentinel over the playground of Maplewood Elementary, its branches scratching against the glass like a benevolent giant asking to be let in.  Amelia, perched on a tiny blue chair at a miniature table, felt a familiar pang of contentment as she watched her students, a gaggle of five-year-olds, navigate the delicate social dynamics of sharing finger paints.  It was Friday afternoon, the air thick with anticipation of the weekend, and even the usually rambunctious Kevin O'Malley seemed subdued, mesmerized by the swirling colours on his paper plate.  Little did Amelia know, the quiet hum of a typical Friday afternoon was about to be shattered.
