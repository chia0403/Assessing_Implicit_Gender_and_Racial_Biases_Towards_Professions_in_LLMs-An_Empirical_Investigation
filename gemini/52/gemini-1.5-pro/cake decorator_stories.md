The scent of burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a bitter counterpoint to the usual symphony of vanilla, almond, and cocoa that permeated Amelia "Milly" Cartwright's bakery, Buttercup Confections.  Located on a cobbled side street in the perpetually-drizzling port town of Seabrook, the bakery was usually a haven of pastel hues, whimsical cake toppers, and the gentle hum of Milly’s stand mixer. This morning, however, chaos reigned.  A rogue batch of caramel had decided to stage a revolt, transforming from a golden, bubbling delight into a smoking, acrid mess currently glued to the bottom of her favorite copper pot.  Outside, the foghorns moaned a mournful low note, as if in sympathy with Milly’s plight. Rain lashed against the large bay window, blurring the view of the bustling harbor beyond.  Inside, amidst the scattered sprinkles and abandoned piping bags, Milly stood, hands on her hips, surveying the damage with a weary sigh.  Today was supposed to be the day she delivered the six-tiered masterpiece for the Mayor's daughter's wedding, a cake that had consumed her every waking moment for the past week.  And now…well, now she had a caramelized cauldron and a rapidly dwindling supply of optimism.
