The biting wind whipped across the vast, ochre expanse of the West Texas desert, stinging Amelia "Milly" Rodriguez's exposed cheeks even through the thick knit of her beanie. Dawn was a bruised purple smear on the horizon, the only illumination coming from the harsh glare of the floodlights mounted on her Caterpillar D10T dozer.  The machine, a behemoth of steel and hydraulics, rumbled beneath her, a comforting vibration against the pre-dawn chill.  Around Milly, the skeletal frames of oil derricks clawed at the lightening sky, their silhouettes stark and lonely against the vastness.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of red dirt, danced across the barren landscape, a prelude to the scorching heat that would inevitably bake the earth later that day.  Today's job: clearing a path for the new pipeline, a scar of progress that would snake its way across this desolate, but lucrative, land.  The air tasted of diesel and dust, a familiar cocktail that Milly had come to associate with the rhythm of her life, a life carved out of grit, grease, and the sheer, raw power of the machines she commanded.
