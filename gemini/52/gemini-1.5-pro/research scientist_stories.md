The biting Antarctic wind whipped at Dr. Aris Thorne's parka, stinging any exposed skin despite the multiple layers he wore.  The sun, a pale ghost in the perpetual twilight of early spring, offered little warmth against the glacial chill that permeated everything.  Around him, the McMurdo research station hummed with a low, mechanical thrum, a stark contrast to the vast, silent emptiness of the Ross Ice Shelf that stretched out before him like a frozen, white ocean.  Aris adjusted his goggles, the icy air fogging the lenses momentarily. He was standing at the edge of a newly melted fissure in the ice, a gaping maw leading down into the dark, unknown depths.  This wasnâ€™t just any fissure. This one, discovered just two weeks prior by satellite imagery, emanated a strange energy signature, an anomaly that had drawn Aris and his team halfway across the world.  He checked the readings on his handheld scanner again. The signal, a pulsing rhythm unlike anything he'd encountered, was stronger than ever.  Something was down there.  Something big.
