The aroma of cardamom and burnt sugar clung to the air in Old Town, a sweet, smoky perfume that announced the day's baking at Eliza Thistlewick's Sweet Surrender Bakery.  Nestled between a dusty antique shop and a perpetually bustling florist, the bakery was a pocket of warmth in the cobbled, grey streets of Aethelburg.  Frost rimed the windowpanes, painting intricate ferns and spirals on the glass, partially obscuring the displays of gingerbread men with jaunty icing smiles and plump Eccles cakes glistening under a sugary glaze. Inside, Eliza, her flour-dusted apron tight around her waist, hummed a jaunty tune as she slid a tray of croissants, puffed golden and perfect, from the oven. The bell above the door jingled merrily, a sound Eliza usually welcomed, but today, a shiver of unease ran down her spine. The shadows in the corners of the shop seemed deeper, the cold from outside more insistent.  Something was different.
