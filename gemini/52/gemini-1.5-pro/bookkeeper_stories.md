The frosted glass of Amelia Holloway's office door declared, in elegant gold lettering, "A. Holloway, Bookkeeping & Accountancy."  It was a lie, of a sort. There was no "& Accountancy." Amelia was a bookkeeper, plain and simple, meticulously balancing the books for the small businesses of Port Blossom, Oregon. Her office, perched above the Salty Siren Fish Market, perpetually smelled faintly of brine and low tide. This Thursday morning in early November was no exception.  Rain lashed against the windows, mimicking the frantic tapping of Ameliaâ€™s fingers on her calculator. Outside, the gray expanse of the Pacific churned restlessly, mirroring the unease churning within her.  The numbers weren't adding up. Not for the Salty Siren, and not for Amelia's carefully constructed life.
