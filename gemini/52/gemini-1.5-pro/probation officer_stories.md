Her desk, a battlefield of overflowing file folders, probation violation reports, and half-eaten granola bars, reflected the chaotic nature of her job.  She was a probation officer, and her caseload was a microcosm of the city's underbelly, a collection of petty thieves, drug addicts, and individuals perpetually teetering on the edge of the law.
