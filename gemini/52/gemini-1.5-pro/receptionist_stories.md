The insistent chirping of the perpetually malfunctioning radiator in Dr. Alistair Finch's waiting room was the soundtrack to Clara Penelope Higgins's Tuesday.  Fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the worn floral carpet and the out-of-date magazines fanned across the low coffee table. Outside, a sleet storm lashed against the large window, obscuring the view of the normally bustling high street of Ashworth, a small, coastal town nestled in the shadow of the brooding, mist-shrouded Grimsby Cliffs. Clara, perched behind her polished oak desk, tapped a perfectly manicured nail against a chipped porcelain mug that read "World's Best Mum," a gift from her now teenage son, which felt increasingly ironic given their recent strained relationship.  The only other occupant of the waiting room was a fidgety elderly gentleman with a hacking cough, who kept glancing nervously at the antique grandfather clock in the corner, its pendulum swinging with hypnotic regularity. The air hung heavy with the scent of antiseptic and something vaguely metallic, a smell Clara had come to associate with the unsettling quiet that often preceded the arrival of Dr. Finch’s more… unusual patients.
