The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Eleanor Vance, plastering stray strands of her auburn hair across her chapped lips. She tugged her wool coat tighter, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth filling her nostrils.  Nestled deep in the Catskill Mountains, Hemlock Hollow High School was a squat, grey building that seemed to hunker down against the encroaching winter like a hibernating bear.  Its windows, frosted at the edges, offered only glimpses of the dimly lit classrooms within. Eleanor, clutching a thermos of lukewarm coffee, trudged across the nearly deserted parking lot towards the heavy oak doors, her breath puffing out in white clouds. It was 7:00 am, a full hour before the student body would arrive, but an early morning meeting with Principal Hayes concerning a particularly troubled student had already cast a shadow over her day.  The hollow silence of the school, usually a haven of quiet before the storm of teenage energy, felt oppressive this morning, a premonition of the difficult conversation that awaited her.
