The aroma of bay rum and talcum powder hung heavy in the air, mingling with the scent of brewing coffee from the diner next door.  Sunlight, filtered through the dusty, striped awning of "Finnegan's Fine Cuts," painted slanted stripes across the worn checkerboard floor.  The year was 1957, and in the small, sleepy town of Harmony Creek, Oregon, life moved at the pace of a lazily swirling barber pole.  Inside, Elias Finch Whitaker, a man whose hands moved with a surgeon's precision and whose tongue wagged with a salesman's charm, meticulously stropped his straight razor, the rhythmic rasp a familiar soundtrack to the morning's quiet.  A single fly buzzed lazily against the windowpane, the only other sound in the otherwise still barbershop.  Elias glanced at the clock â€“ 8:58 am. Two minutes until the first appointment, and Harmony Creek, like clockwork, would begin to trickle in, one head of hair at a time.
