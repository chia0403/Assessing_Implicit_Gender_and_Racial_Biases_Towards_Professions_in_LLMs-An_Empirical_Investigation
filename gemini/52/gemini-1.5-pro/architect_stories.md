Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Elias Thorne's apartment, mirroring the tempest brewing inside him.  Twenty-two stories above the relentless churn of Chicago traffic, the city lights blurred into a hazy, Impressionist painting.  His normally pristine minimalist living space, a testament to his architectural precision, was strewn with blueprints, crumpled napkins covered in frantic calculations, and empty coffee cups.  Elias, his usually impeccable brown hair disheveled, paced the polished concrete floor, the rhythmic tap of his worn Oxford shoes a counterpoint to the rhythmic drumming of the rain.  The Parker Meridien Hotel, his most ambitious project to date – a soaring glass and steel behemoth designed to redefine the city's skyline – was facing a critical structural issue, and the grand opening was just three weeks away.
