The neon "EAT" sign of the Desert Rose Diner buzzed erratically, casting a sickly yellow glow over the cracked asphalt of the parking lot.  Just outside Needles, California, where the Mojave Desert stretched out like a crumpled brown blanket, the air hung thick and hot, even at 3:00 am. Inside, a lone waitress wiped down the counter with a weary sigh, the only sound competing with the low hum of the refrigerator and the distant drone of eighteen-wheelers on Interstate 40.  This was Delilah “Dee” Jones’s regular stop on her bi-weekly run from Los Angeles to Albuquerque.  Tonight, however, something felt different.  The usual quiet anticipation of a hot cup of coffee and a slice of apple pie was replaced by a knot of unease in Dee’s stomach.  She pulled her rig, a gleaming Peterbilt 389 she affectionately called “The Wanderer,” into its usual spot near the back, cut the engine, and sat for a moment, listening to the silence of the desert.  It was a silence that usually comforted her, but tonight, it felt heavy, pregnant with an unspoken threat.
