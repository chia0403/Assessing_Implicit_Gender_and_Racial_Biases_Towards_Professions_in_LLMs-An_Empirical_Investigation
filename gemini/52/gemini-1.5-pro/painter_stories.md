The salt-laced wind whipped Amelia Rose Hawthorne's auburn braid across her face as she surveyed the scene before her.  Perched precariously on a folding stool at the edge of the cliff, her paint box balanced on the uneven ground, Amelia gripped her palette knife. Below her, the churning turquoise waters of the Aegean Sea crashed against the volcanic rock of Santorini, sending plumes of white spray high into the air. The whitewashed houses of Oia, clinging to the caldera's rim like a string of pearls, shimmered under the late afternoon sun.  This, this impossible landscape of vibrant blues and blinding whites, was what Amelia had traveled across the world to capture, to translate onto canvas with her own unique blend of impressionism and stark realism. This was the moment she had been waiting for.
