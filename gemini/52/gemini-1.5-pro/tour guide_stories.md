The salt spray kissed Amelia "Millie" Reyes's face as she leaned against the railing of the *Mermaid's Kiss*, a battered but beloved ferry chugging its way towards Inis Fáil.  The mythical island, shrouded in perpetual mist just off the coast of County Clare, Ireland, was Millie's bread and butter.  Its craggy cliffs, dotted with puffins and shrouded in whispers of fae folk, drew tourists like moths to a flickering flame.  This morning, the flame was particularly bright, the sky a preternatural shade of lavender, the air thick with the scent of brine and something else, something… otherworldly. Millie adjusted the strap of her worn leather satchel, a nervous flutter in her stomach.  This wasn't just any tour group.  This was the annual gathering of the Paranormal Investigators of Great Britain, and Millie, a tour guide specializing in local folklore, not ghost hunting, had a feeling this trip was going to be anything but ordinary.
