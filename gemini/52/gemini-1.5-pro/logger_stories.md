The biting wind howled through the skeletal branches of the Douglas firs, clawing at Jedediah "Jed" Blackwood's thick flannel shirt as he surveyed the pre-dawn gloom of the Cascade Mountains.  A thin veil of icy fog snaked through the valley below, obscuring the small logging town of Cedar Creek, Washington, where Jed lived with his wife and two young daughters.  The air, crisp and carrying the sharp tang of pine resin, stung his nostrils as he exhaled a plume of white breath.  His calloused hands, rough as bark, gripped the warm mug of coffee he'd brought from home, the only comfort against the encroaching chill of a November morning.  The chainsaw hanging from his wide leather belt, gleaming faintly in the weak light, was a familiar weight, a silent promise of the hard day's work ahead.  Today, Jed and his crew were felling Big Bertha, a behemoth of a tree that had stood sentinel over this valley for centuries.  It was a dangerous job, but Jed, with twenty years of experience under his belt, faced it with the stoic resolve of a man who understood the rhythm of the forest, both its beauty and its brutality.
