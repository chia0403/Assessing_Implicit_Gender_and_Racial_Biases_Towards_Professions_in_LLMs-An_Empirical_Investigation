The siren shrieked, a high-pitched wail slicing through the humid New Orleans night. Rain lashed against the windshield of Medic One, blurring the already hazy sodium glow of the streetlights.  Inside, Amelia "Amy" Dubois, her dark curls plastered to her forehead, adjusted her stethoscope, the rhythmic thump of the engine a counterpoint to the frantic beat of her own heart. They were headed to the French Quarter, dispatch reporting a possible stabbing near Jackson Square. Amy gripped the aluminum handrail, the metallic chill a stark contrast to the suffocating heat inside the rig. The air hung thick with the smells of antiseptic and old coffee, a familiar cocktail of anticipation and dread.  Outside, wrought iron balconies dripped with rain, and the scent of jasmine, usually a sweet perfume, hung heavy and cloying in the humid air.  Tonight, even the romance of the Vieux Carr√© seemed to hold its breath, waiting for the next tragedy to unfold.
