The rhythmic snip of Amelia "Millie" Hawthorne's shears punctuated the humid Charleston air, a familiar counterpoint to the chirping cicadas and distant church bells. Her salon, "The Copper Comb," nestled between a bustling bakery and a dusty antique shop on Tradd Street, was a pocket of cool, lavender-scented calm. Sunlight streamed through the large front window, illuminating swirling motes of dust and glinting off the brass fixtures Millie had painstakingly polished that morning. The walls, painted a soothing shade of seafoam green, were adorned with framed vintage Vogue covers and quirky, hand-painted signs proclaiming "Good Hair Days Ahead" and "Life is too short for boring hair."  It was a Tuesday morning in late July, and Millie, with her fiery red curls pinned back with a tortoiseshell comb, was already on her third client, a Southern belle with hair the color of spun moonlight who was recounting, in meticulous detail, her disastrous blind date the previous evening.  Outside, the city of Charleston simmered, but within The Copper Comb, a different kind of heat was about to ignite.
