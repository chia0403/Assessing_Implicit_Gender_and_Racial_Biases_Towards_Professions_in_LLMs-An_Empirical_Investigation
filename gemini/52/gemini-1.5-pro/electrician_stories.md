The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorne, snagging at the edges of his high-visibility jacket as he surveyed the dilapidated Victorian mansion.  Wrought iron gates, rusted to the colour of dried blood, hung precariously from their hinges.  Ivy, thick as a man's arm, clawed its way up the grey stone facade, obscuring stained-glass windows that hinted at a forgotten opulence.  Dry leaves skittered across the overgrown driveway, leading to a crumbling portico where a single, flickering gas lamp cast eerie shadows.  Elias, his breath clouding in the frigid air, checked the address on his crumpled work order one last time: Blackwood Manor, Hemlock Lane.  This was it. The place locals whispered about, the place where electricity went to die. Heâ€™d been specifically requested, a note on the order stating "Mr. Thorne only." He had a feeling this wasn't going to be a simple rewiring job.
