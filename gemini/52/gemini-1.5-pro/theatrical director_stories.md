The biting November wind whipped around Vivienne Antoinette Moreau, plastering stray strands of her auburn hair across her lipstick-stained cheek. She tugged her scarlet beret further down, its jaunty angle doing little to alleviate the chill that seeped into her very bones.  Around her, the dilapidated Grand Majestic Theatre loomed, a gothic behemoth hunched against the grey Glasgow sky.  Its chipped stone facade, once the epitome of elegance, now wore its decay like a tattered shawl.  Ivy, thick and relentless, clawed its way up the walls, obscuring stained-glass windows that depicted scenes from Shakespearean tragedies â€“ a fitting metaphor, Vivienne thought wryly, for the state of the theatre itself.  She had six weeks to transform this crumbling relic into a fitting venue for her avant-garde interpretation of *A Midsummer Night's Dream*, and the magnitude of the task threatened to swallow her whole.
