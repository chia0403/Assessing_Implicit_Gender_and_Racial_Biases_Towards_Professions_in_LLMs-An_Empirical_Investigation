The fluorescent lights of "Curl Up & Dye," a salon nestled between a laundromat and a suspiciously empty storefront in downtown Harmony, Indiana, hummed a monotonous tune. Rain lashed against the large plate-glass window, blurring the already fading neon "OPEN" sign.

The scent of hairspray mingled with the earthy aroma of the herbal tea Amelia constantly brewed to combat the chemical smells that permeated her workday. Outside, Harmony, a town typically as sleepy as a Sunday afternoon sermon, was bracing itself for the annual Founder's Day Festival, an event promising three days of parades, pie-eating contests, and enough small-town drama to fuel gossip for the next year. Amelia, however, had more pressing concerns than the impending influx of tourists and their questionable hairstyles. A mysterious package had arrived that morning, addressed simply to "The Beautician," containing nothing but a single, antique key and a faded photograph of a woman with hauntingly familiar eyes.
