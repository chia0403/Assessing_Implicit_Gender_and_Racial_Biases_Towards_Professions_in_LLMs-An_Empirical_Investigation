The salt spray kissed Amelia "Amy" Thorne's face as she perched precariously on the jagged rocks overlooking the churning Atlantic.  Her easel, battered and splattered with every colour imaginable, stood firm against the wind, anchored by a heavy rock she'd scavenged from the beach.  The small fishing village of Portwenn, Cornwall, nestled in the cove below, was a riot of slate-grey roofs and brightly painted doors, a stark contrast to the brooding grey sky above.  October had arrived, bringing with it the biting wind and the dramatic, ever-shifting light that Amy, a landscape artist perpetually chasing the perfect seascape, found both exhilarating and frustrating. This particular afternoon, the light was a bruised purple, the sea a restless, swirling mass of dark greens and blues, mirroring the turmoil within her own creative spirit.  A blank canvas stared back at her, its stark whiteness a challenge she wasn't yet ready to accept.
