The relentless London drizzle seemed to mirror the grey mood clinging to Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne.  Her flat, a converted Victorian attic in Notting Hill, usually vibrated with the electric hum of her iMac and the splash of colour from her latest project.  Tonight, however, the only illumination came from the flickering gas lamp on Portobello Road, casting long, skeletal shadows across her cluttered workspace.  Half-finished designs lay scattered across her drawing tablet, discarded colour palettes like fallen autumn leaves. Amy, clad in an oversized paint-splattered hoodie and thick woolly socks, stared out the rain-streaked window, the vibrant street market below a muted watercolour blur.  A rejection email from the prestigious design firm, Sterling & Finch, still glowed ominously on her screen, the words "not a good fit" burning themselves into her retinas.  This was the third rejection this month.  Something had to change.
