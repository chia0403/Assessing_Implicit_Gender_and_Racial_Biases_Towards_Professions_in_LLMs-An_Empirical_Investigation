The rain hammered against the arched windows of the Grand Majestic Hotel, each drop a tiny, insistent drumbeat against the otherwise hushed elegance of the lobby.  Crystal chandeliers glittered like frozen fireworks overhead, casting fractured rainbows across the polished marble floor.

Behind the imposing mahogany concierge desk, Elias Thorne adjusted his emerald green tie, a perfect complement to the hotel’s opulent decor.  Outside, the Chicago wind howled, a feral beast clawing at the city, but inside, within the gilded cage of the Grand Majestic, everything was calm, controlled, and utterly predictable.  Or so Elias thought.
