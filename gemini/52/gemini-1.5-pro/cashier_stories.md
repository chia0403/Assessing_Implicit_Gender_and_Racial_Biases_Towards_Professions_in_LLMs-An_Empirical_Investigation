The fluorescent lights of the Quick Stop hummed a monotonous B flat, a soundtrack to Amelia Reyesâ€™s Tuesday afternoon.  Outside, the late August sun beat down on the cracked asphalt of the parking lot, baking the fumes of gasoline and stale hot dogs into a shimmering haze.  Amelia, perched on her stool behind the chipped Formica counter, watched the heat rise in waves.  Inside, the air conditioning wheezed a pathetic imitation of cool air, struggling to combat the oppressive heat and the smell of week-old coffee that clung to the faded linoleum floor.  Quick Stop, ironically named, was anything but. Time seemed to slow to a crawl within its sticky, fluorescent-lit confines, punctuated only by the occasional chime of the door and the rhythmic beeping of the ancient cash register.  Amelia, with her nametag slightly askew on her faded blue polo shirt, sighed and idly rearranged the dusty rack of impulse-buy candy bars, wishing for something, anything, to disrupt the monotony.
