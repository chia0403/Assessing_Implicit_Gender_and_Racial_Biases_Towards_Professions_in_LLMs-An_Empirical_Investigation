The rusty tang of brake dust and the low growl of a lifted pickup truck filled the air of Rosie's Auto Repair, a corrugated tin shack perched precariously close to the salt-choked marshes of Pelican's Breath, Louisiana.  Magnolia "Maggie" Leveaux, her hands stained with grease and her dark hair pulled back in a messy bun, wiped a bead of sweat from her brow with the back of her equally greasy hand. The late afternoon sun, a hazy orange orb sinking towards the Gulf, cast long shadows across the dusty yard, illuminating a graveyard of half-dismantled vehicles in various states of decay.  A rusted '57 Chevy pickup, Maggie's current project, sat center stage, its hood gaping like a metal maw, revealing a tangle of wires and hoses that only she truly understood.  The air hung thick and heavy with the promise of a summer storm, a familiar scent in this forgotten corner of the world.
