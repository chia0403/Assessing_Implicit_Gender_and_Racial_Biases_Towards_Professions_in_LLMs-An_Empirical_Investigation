The salt spray kissed Amelia Reyes's face as she leaned precariously over the railing of the *Sea Serpent*, a rust-bucket trawler currently battling a choppy swell off the coast of Monterey, California.  The biting wind whipped at her thick, dark braid, pulling stray strands across her chapped lips. Below, the deck was a chaotic ballet of slicker-clad fishermen hauling in the day's catch â€“ a writhing, silver mass of sardines glinting under the unforgiving sodium lights. Amelia ignored the fishy tang and the shouts of the crew, her focus entirely consumed by the churning, inky blackness where the Pacific Ocean met the bruised pre-dawn sky.  Her Nikon D850, heavy and familiar in her grip, was her shield against the encroaching cold, her window into a world few others ever witnessed. This was the moment she craved, the volatile edge between darkness and light, where the raw beauty of the ocean revealed itself in fleeting glimpses.  She was hunting for the perfect shot, the one that would capture the elusive essence of the sea, the one that would finally make her name.
