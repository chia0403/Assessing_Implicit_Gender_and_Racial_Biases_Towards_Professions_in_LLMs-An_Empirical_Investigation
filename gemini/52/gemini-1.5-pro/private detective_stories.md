Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Alexander "Alex" Ramsey's office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside him.  The flickering neon sign of the pawn shop across the street cast a sickly green glow across his worn mahogany desk, illuminating a half-eaten tuna sandwich and a stack of unpaid bills.  Alex Ramsey, Private Investigator, wasn't exactly drowning in cases these days.  His office, nestled above a laundromat in the less-than-salubrious district of New Dawn City, usually smelled of stale cigarette smoke and desperation.  Tonight, however, the overriding scent was rain and impending trouble.  The knock on the door was hesitant, almost apologetic, the kind that usually preceded a client with a story too sordid for the cops and a wallet too thin for a reputable firm.  Alex sighed, pushing the sandwich away.  This was New Dawn City, and trouble, like the rain, never stayed away for long.
