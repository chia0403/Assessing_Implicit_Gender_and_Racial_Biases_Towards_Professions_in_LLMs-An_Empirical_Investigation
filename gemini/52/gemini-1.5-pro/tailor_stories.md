The rhythmic clack of the treadle sewing machine punctuated the otherwise silent pre-dawn hours in Elias Thorne's small tailor shop. Nestled between a bustling bakery and a perpetually gloomy pawnbroker on Grimshaw Lane, in the perpetually overcast city of Aethelburg, the shop was a haven of meticulous order.  Elias, his spectacles perched precariously on his nose, meticulously stitched the final pearl buttons onto a waistcoat of deep emerald velvet, the faint gaslight catching the shimmer of the thread. Outside, the cobbled streets were still slick with the night's rain, and a thick fog, the colour of diluted milk, clung to the gas lamps like spectral shrouds, blurring the already indistinct shapes of the buildings opposite.  Aethelburg, a city built on whispers and secrets, was slowly beginning to stir, unaware of the strange commission that awaited Elias Thorne that very morning.
