The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, carrying the scent of brine and something faintly metallic to Elias Thorne, who stood framed in the doorway of his shop, "Thorne's Prime Cuts."  The flickering gaslight above cast a warm glow against the encroaching dusk, illuminating the neat rows of sausages hanging in the window and the glistening sides of beef suspended from hooks within.
