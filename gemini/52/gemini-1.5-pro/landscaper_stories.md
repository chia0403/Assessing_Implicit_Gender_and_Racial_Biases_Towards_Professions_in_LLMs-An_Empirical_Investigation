The biting October wind whipped Amelia “Amy” Hawthorne’s auburn braid across her face as she surveyed the sprawling McGregor estate.  Crimson and gold leaves swirled around her worn work boots, a vibrant carpet spread across the manicured lawns that stretched down to the grey, churning waters of Lake Ontario.  Amy pulled her fleece tighter, the damp air seeping through the fabric despite its thickness.  Autumn in Oakhaven, Ontario was beautiful, but unforgiving. This year, winter threatened to arrive early, and Amy had a monumental task ahead of her: preparing the McGregor gardens, renowned for their delicate roses and exotic topiary, for the impending frost.  The estate, a Victorian mansion with gingerbread trim and imposing turrets, loomed over her, its many windows reflecting the stormy sky like watchful eyes.  For twenty years, Amy had tended these grounds, nurturing them through every season. But this year felt different.  A sense of unease, like the first icy fingers of winter, clung to the air.
