The fluorescent lights of Northwood High hummed a monotonous B-flat, a soundtrack to Eleanor Vance's Tuesday morning. Rain lashed against the window of her office, blurring the already muted colors of the late October landscape.  Crimson and gold leaves, once vibrant, now clung sodden to branches, mirroring the dampened spirits Eleanor often encountered within these walls. Her office, a small but meticulously organized space, offered a refuge from the chaotic energy of the high school hallways.  Framed inspirational posters – ironically, most featuring kittens hanging from tree branches with captions like "Hang in There!" – adorned the walls, interspersed with Eleanor's various degrees and certifications. A faint scent of lavender, emanating from a diffuser on her desk, attempted to combat the ever-present aroma of stale cafeteria pizza. Today, however, even the lavender seemed to be losing the battle.
