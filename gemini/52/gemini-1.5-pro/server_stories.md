The flickering neon sign of the Starlight Diner cast a greasy, rainbow sheen across the rain-slicked asphalt of Route 66. Inside, amongst the vinyl booths worn smooth by generations of truckers and dreamers,  Amelia "Amy" Reyes balanced a tray laden with coffee, a patty melt, and a slice of cherry pie â€“ the Starlight's "Blue Plate Special."  It was 2:17 AM, the witching hour in Harmony Creek, Arizona, a town barely bigger than the diner itself. Amy, with her perpetually tired eyes and a nametag pinned slightly askew, surveyed her domain: two elderly women gossiping over lukewarm tea, a lone trucker hunched over a crossword, and the persistent drip-drip-drip of a leaky faucet that mirrored the relentless drizzle outside.  Tonight, like most nights, the Starlight was a sanctuary from the storm, a beacon in the vast, empty darkness of the desert.  But tonight, something felt different.  A low hum vibrated beneath the rhythmic clatter of dishes, a subtle shift in the air that hinted at a change on the horizon.
