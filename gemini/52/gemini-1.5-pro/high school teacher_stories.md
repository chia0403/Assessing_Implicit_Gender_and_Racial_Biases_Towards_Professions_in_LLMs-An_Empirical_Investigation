The biting November wind whipped around Ms. Eleanor Vance as she hurried across the near-deserted parking lot of Northwood High.  Fluorescent lights buzzed from within the squat, brick building, casting long, rectangular pools of pale yellow onto the slick asphalt. The skeletal branches of the elm trees lining the perimeter rattled like dry bones, their leaves long since surrendered to the approaching winter.  Northwood, Pennsylvania, was a town that wore its weariness on its sleeve â€“ the faded paint of the storefronts downtown, the rusting swing set in the small park across from the school, even the perpetually overcast sky seemed to sigh under the weight of its own monotony.  For Eleanor, it was a town that clung to her like a damp wool coat, comfortable in its familiarity but stifling in its lack of prospect. Tonight, however, the familiar chill held a new edge, a prickling unease that had nothing to do with the dropping temperature.
