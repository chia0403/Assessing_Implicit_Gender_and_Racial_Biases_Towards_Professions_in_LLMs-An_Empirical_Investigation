Rain lashed against the windows of "Nourish," Amelia Grace Hawthorne's tiny dietetics practice, nestled between a bustling laundromat and a perpetually empty storefront promising "Authentic Mongolian BBQ" (which, Amelia suspected, had never seen a yurt, let alone a Mongolian chef). The damp October air seeped in through the ill-fitting door frame each time a client entered, carrying with it the scent of wet wool and decaying leaves.  Inside, the waiting area, furnished with two worn armchairs and a stack of outdated health magazines, was dimly lit by a flickering fluorescent light that buzzed with the persistence of a particularly annoying mosquito. Amelia, perched on her rolling stool behind a cluttered desk, tapped a pen against her teeth, her brow furrowed as she reviewed the latest dietary recall â€“ apparently, even kale chips could be tainted these days. The steady rhythm of the rain and the rhythmic tapping of her pen were the only sounds breaking the otherwise heavy silence of the late afternoon.  She had exactly one client scheduled for the rest of the day, and a nagging feeling that something was about to change.
