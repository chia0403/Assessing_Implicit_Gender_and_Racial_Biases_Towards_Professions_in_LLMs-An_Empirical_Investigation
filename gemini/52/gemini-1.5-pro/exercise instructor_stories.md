The relentless Miami sun beat down on Ocean Drive, turning the turquoise water into a shimmering mirage.  Palm trees swayed in the humid breeze, their fronds rustling like gossiping socialites.  Inside the air-conditioned sanctuary of "Sculpt & Shine,"  Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez surveyed her domain with a critical eye.  Sweat glistened on the polished wood floor, a testament to the high-energy Zumba class she'd just finished.  Amy, all sharp angles and vibrant energy despite the demanding workout, adjusted the massive speakers blasting upbeat Latin music, already prepping for the next wave of lycra-clad clients.  The scent of coconut oil and determination hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume in Amyâ€™s life.  This wasn't just a gym; it was her sanctuary, her creation, her escape from a past that still clung to her like the salty air.
