The insistent Vermont wind howled a mournful tune around the eaves of Dr. Abraham Finchâ€™s dental practice, rattling the frosted windowpanes. Inside, the air was thick with the sterile scent of disinfectant and the faint, metallic tang of fear.  Amelia Grace Hawthorne, a dental hygienist with a smile that could melt glaciers and a hand steady enough to thread a needle through a snowflake, adjusted the overhead lamp, its beam illuminating the anxious face in the reclining chair.  Snow piled against the window, blurring the view of the quaint, snow-covered town of Maple Creek, population 842, give or take a few ski bums and the occasional wandering moose.  It was the deepest December freeze in a decade, and Amelia had a feeling this particular Tuesday was about to get a whole lot colder.
