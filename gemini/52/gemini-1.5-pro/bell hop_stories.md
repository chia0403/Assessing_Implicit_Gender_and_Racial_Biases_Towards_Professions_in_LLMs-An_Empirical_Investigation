The revolving doors of the Grand Majestic Hotel whispered a sigh of cool air onto the sweltering New Orleans street as Elias Finch, bell hop extraordinaire, adjusted his cap.  It was July, thick with humidity that clung to the wrought-iron balconies and dripped from the magnolia trees lining the boulevard.  Built in the opulent style of the French Quarter, the Majestic boasted a lobby that could rival a cathedral, all polished marble floors, glittering chandeliers, and a sweeping staircase fit for a king.  Elias, however, occupied a less glamorous corner, tucked behind a towering potted palm near the concierge desk.  He was a wiry young man with quick hands and an even quicker wit, always ready with a smile and a well-placed "yes, ma'am" or "certainly, sir."  He knew every nook and cranny of the Majestic, from the hidden service corridors to the penthouse suites with their private rooftop gardens. Today, however, he had a feeling this familiarity wouldn't be enough. The air crackled with an unusual tension, a subtle unease that hung heavier than the Louisiana heat.
