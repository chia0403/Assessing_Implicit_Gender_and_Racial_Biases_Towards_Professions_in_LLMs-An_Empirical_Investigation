The biting wind whipped off the Puget Sound, carrying the scent of salt and pine through the open window of Amelia Grace Holloway's small, shingle-sided clinic. Rain lashed against the glass, mirroring the persistent ache in Amelia's shoulder, a souvenir from her days as a competitive rower.  "Sound Body Physical Therapy" proclaimed the hand-painted sign above the door, its cheerful blue letters a stark contrast to the grey November afternoon. Inside, the warm glow of salt lamps fought the gloom, illuminating the exercise equipment and anatomical charts that lined the walls. Amelia, her blonde hair pulled back in a practical braid, adjusted the height of the treatment table, preparing for her next patient, a fisherman with a perpetually frozen shoulder, a common ailment in this small Washington town of Port Blossom. The rhythmic clang of the halyard from the marina across the street punctuated the silence, a soundtrack to Amelia's life, a life she had carefully built, brick by brick, away from the glittering, demanding world of Seattle.  A life she thought she wanted, until the phone rang, shattering the quiet, and with it, her carefully constructed peace.
