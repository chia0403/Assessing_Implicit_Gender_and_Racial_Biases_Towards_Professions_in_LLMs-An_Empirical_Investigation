The bell above the door of "Petal & Stem" tinkled a melancholic two-note tune, the sound swallowed by the thick, humid air of a Charleston July.  Eliza Jane Beaumont, her fingers stained a delicate shade of lilac from arranging a morning delivery of irises, sighed and pushed a stray curl of auburn hair behind her ear.  The shop, a riot of color and scent, was a haven from the sweltering heat outside.  Sunlight streamed through the large front windows, illuminating the buckets overflowing with hydrangeas, roses, and lilies, their perfume mingling with the earthy aroma of damp moss and freshly cut stems.  Eliza Jane, despite the beauty that surrounded her, felt a prickle of unease. The air hung heavy, not just with humidity, but with a sense of anticipation, a feeling that something – something significant – was about to bloom.
