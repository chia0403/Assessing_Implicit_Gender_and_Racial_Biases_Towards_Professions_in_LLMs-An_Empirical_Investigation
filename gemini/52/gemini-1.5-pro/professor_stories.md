The biting November wind whipped around Professor Elias Thorne, tugging at the edges of his tweed coat as he hurried across the cobbled quadrangle of St. Jude's College, Oxford. Gargoyles leered down from the medieval stonework, their grotesque features softened by a dusting of snow.  A faint chime echoed from the clock tower, signaling the quarter hour.  The gas lamps, recently lit against the encroaching dusk, cast flickering pools of orange light across the frosted lawns, highlighting the skeletal branches of the ancient oak trees. Elias clutched a leather-bound volume of Milton's Paradise Lost tighter against his chest, the cold seeping through the worn leather and into his gloved fingers.  He was already late for his tutorial with the notoriously precocious Miss Cavendish, and the prospect filled him with a familiar blend of anticipation and dread.  Tonight's topic: the nature of evil.  The very air seemed to crackle with it.
