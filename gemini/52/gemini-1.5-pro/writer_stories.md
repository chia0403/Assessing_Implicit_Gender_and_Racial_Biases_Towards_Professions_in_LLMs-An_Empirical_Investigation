The salt-laced wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne's hair across her face, momentarily blinding her to the view she'd travelled thousands of miles to see.  Perched atop the craggy cliffs of Inishmore, the largest of the Aran Islands, she inhaled the raw, untamed beauty of the Atlantic crashing against the limestone shore below.  The air, thick with the cries of gulls and the distant bleating of sheep, held a loneliness that resonated deeply with her.  A half-finished manuscript, crumpled and dog-eared, lay forgotten in the pocket of her worn tweed coat.

But the whispers, for now, remained elusive, lost in the constant roar of the ocean.
