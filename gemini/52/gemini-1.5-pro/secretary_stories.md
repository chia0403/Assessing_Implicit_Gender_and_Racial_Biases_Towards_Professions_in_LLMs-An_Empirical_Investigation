Mahogany bookshelves lined the walls, overflowing with leather-bound volumes and gleaming brass trophies.  A Persian rug, intricate in its design, covered the polished wooden floor. This was the office of Mr. Silas Blackwood, CEO of Blackwood Industries, a sprawling conglomerate with its fingers in everything from shipping to silk stockings, and Amelia was his gatekeeper, his confidante, and, some might whisper, his keeper of secrets.  The year was 1948, and the city outside, buzzing with the post-war resurgence, was Los Angeles.
