The flickering neon sign of the Starlight Diner cast a greasy, purple glow across Detective Isabella "Izzy" Diaz's rain-slicked trench coat. November in Alder Creek, Pennsylvania, was less charming than the travel brochures suggested.  The wind howled down Main Street, rattling the skeletal branches of the ancient oak trees that lined the sidewalk, and spitting icy rain that threatened to turn to sleet. Alder Creek, nestled deep in the Appalachian Mountains, was a town steeped in coal-mining history, a place where the shadows seemed to linger longer than the daylight, and the secrets ran deeper than the mineshafts that honeycombed the earth beneath their feet.  Izzy, her breath clouding the frigid air, pushed open the diner door, the bell above it jingling a discordant welcome.  The smell of stale coffee and burnt bacon hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the crisp, pine-scented mountain air she was used to.  Tonight, however, even the greasy spoon diner felt like a sanctuary. Tonight, Alder Creek had a body.
