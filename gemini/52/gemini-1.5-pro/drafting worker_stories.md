The flickering fluorescent lights of Henderson & Sons Architectural Design hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the frantic scratching of pencils on vellum.  Dust motes danced in the pale rectangles cast by the drafting lamps, illuminating the stooped figure of Elias Thorne. His brow furrowed in concentration, Elias meticulously rendered the cross-section of a load-bearing wall, the fine point of his 2H pencil leaving a whisper-thin line on the drafting paper. Outside, the Chicago wind howled a mournful song, rattling the large windows overlooking the grey, choppy waters of Lake Michigan.  It was a late November afternoon in 1958, the kind that seeped into your bones with a damp, chilling embrace, and Elias, despite the layers he wore, could feel the cold creeping in.  The office, usually buzzing with the energy of a dozen draftsmen, was eerily quiet.  Everyone else had already gone home for the Thanksgiving holiday, leaving Elias alone with his drawings and the ghostly echoes of blueprints past.  He had a deadline looming, a particularly demanding client, and a nagging feeling that something was not quite right with the structural integrity of the west wing.
