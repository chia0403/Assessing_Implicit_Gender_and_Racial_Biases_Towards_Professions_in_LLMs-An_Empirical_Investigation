Her mahogany desk, a monument to her tireless ambition, was buried beneath a mountain of files, each one a potential minefield of errors.  The city, so vibrant and dynamic from a distance, felt cold and impersonal close up, a relentless machine that demanded efficiency and excellence, leaving little room for compassion or human connection.
