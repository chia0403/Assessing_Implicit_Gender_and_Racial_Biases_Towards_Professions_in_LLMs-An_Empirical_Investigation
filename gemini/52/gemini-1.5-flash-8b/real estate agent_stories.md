The biting wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Sterling's crimson scarf around her neck, a stark contrast to the beige stucco of the sprawling Californian estate looming before her.  Sunlight, fractured by the relentless gusts, cast long shadows across the manicured lawns, highlighting the stark emptiness that hung heavy in the air.  It was a Tuesday in late October, and the crisp air, usually a welcome change from the relentless summer heat, felt almost hostile. Amy, a seasoned real estate agent with a reputation for closing deals quicker than a speeding bullet, felt a chill deeper than the wind.

Rumored to be haunted by the echoes of a tragic love story from the 1920s, its history clung to the walls like cobwebs.  Each creak of the ancient oak trees, each mournful wail of the wind, amplified the whispers.  Amy, despite her hardened exterior and confident demeanor, found a peculiar unease settling in her gut.  This wasn't just about the hefty price tag; it was about the stories, the unspoken, the tangible sense of somethingâ€¦ lost.
