The biting wind whipped Amelia Nightingale's auburn hair across her face as she surveyed the sprawling aviary.  Dust motes danced in the weak afternoon sun, illuminating the intricate latticework of the enclosure.  Below, a flock of colourful macaws, their iridescent plumage shimmering, squawked and jostled for position on the branches. Amelia, her grey uniform almost swallowed by the gloom of the twilight aviary, adjusted the leather strap of her satchel, a familiar weight of responsibility settling on her shoulders.  This was the heart of the Blackwood Bird Sanctuary, a sanctuary where the whispers of ancient woodlands echoed through the high vaulted ceilings, and where creatures from every corner of the world were entrusted to her care.  Her name, a peculiar one, often whispered amongst the groundskeepers, resonated with a quiet strength, a testament to her determination and her love for these winged wonders.  Tonight, the air hung heavy with a different kind of anticipation. The rare Scarlet-Crested Tanagers, recently relocated to their new habitat, were exhibiting unusual behaviour.  Amelia knew instinctively something wasn't right.
