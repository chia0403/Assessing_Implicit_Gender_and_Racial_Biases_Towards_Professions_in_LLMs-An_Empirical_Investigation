The flickering fluorescent lights of the Sterling & Sterling accounting firm cast long, skeletal shadows across Amelia Peabody's meticulously organized desk.  Paperclips, neatly arranged in graduated sizes, glinted faintly.  A single, perfectly formed daisy, a gift from her aunt, sat nestled in a chipped ceramic pot.  It was a quiet Tuesday morning, the kind that stretched on, endless and predictable, just like the rhythm of Amelia's life.  Amelia, a secretary of almost ten years at the firm, was meticulously preparing for the day's barrage of emails, phone calls, and faxes.  The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and the faint, almost imperceptible, metallic tang of fear.  Sterling & Sterling had been losing substantial clients for the past quarter, a whisper of impending doom circulating through the hushed hallways.


Amelia's office, a small, windowless cubicle in the back of the building, felt both cramped and suffocating.  The walls were painted a sterile shade of beige, and the only splash of color came from the brightly colored sticky notes scattered across her computer monitor. Each note detailed a deadline, a conference call, or a crucial client meeting.  Rows of filing cabinets stretched into the distance, silent sentinels guarding the firm's financial secrets.  Outside, the city bustled with a life Amelia rarely shared.  Her world was contained within these four walls, meticulously ordered, and yet...uncertain.
