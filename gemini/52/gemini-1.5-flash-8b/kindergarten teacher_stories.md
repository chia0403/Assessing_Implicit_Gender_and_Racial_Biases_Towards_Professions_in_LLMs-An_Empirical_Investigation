The chipped paint of the "Happy Helpers" kindergarten classroom, a faded, cheerful yellow, seemed to vibrate with the energy of a hundred tiny tornadoes.  Sunlight, fractured by the stained-glass windows depicting friendly animals, slanted across Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's worn, but beloved, wooden desk.  Crayon shavings, a chaotic confetti of crimson, sapphire, and ochre, littered the surface, a testament to the artistic explosions of the morning.  Amy, a petite woman with a perpetually surprised expression, surveyed the scene with a practiced eye, her heart full of a quiet joy.  This was her happy place, this riot of boisterous two-year-olds to five-year-olds, these little hands clutching her heart as she held them so carefully in her classroom at Maplewood Elementary.  The day began, not with bells or whistles, but with the cacophony of "good mornings" and the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of little feet rushing to their designated activity centers. Today, a particularly vibrant mural depicting a giant sunflower was taking shape in the corner, and Amy, always fascinated by the small acts of creation, had a sneaking suspicion that this particular sunflower might hold a secret.
