The chipped porcelain sink of the Grand Zenith Hotel, a monument to Art Deco grandeur in the heart of a perpetually twilight Chicago, reflected Elias Thorne's meticulously arranged spectacles.  Rain lashed against the enormous, leaded-glass windows, mirroring the tempest brewing inside him.  Elias, Grand Zenith Concierge for the past seven years, considered the cryptic note clutched in his hand.  It was addressed to him, in elegant, italic script, simply bearing the name "The Curator."  No room number, no guest name, just the single, chilling word.  A new kind of mystery.  One that smelled of old books and forgotten secrets, of whispers carried on the chill winds that whistled through the ornate hotel corridors.  The Grand Zenith was a labyrinth of hidden alcoves, dimly lit hallways, and hushed conversations.  A place where shadows danced with ghosts, and the past held a relentless grip on the present.  Tonight, that past seemed ready to reveal itself, and Elias, armed with nothing but his finely honed intuition and a decades-old fascination with the city's underbelly, felt the tremors of the unknown beginning to shake his world.
