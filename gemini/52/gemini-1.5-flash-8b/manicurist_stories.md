The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual, dull rose, reflected Amelia Nightingale's face.  Her reflection, usually a vibrant tapestry of freckles and laughter lines, was strained, etched with the anxieties of a Tuesday.  Tiny, manicured fingernails, painted a delicate shade of lavender, tapped rhythmically against the counter, each tap echoing the frantic drumbeat in her chest.  The salon, "Graceful Nails," nestled on a quiet side street in the heart of Oakhaven, was usually a haven of soothing aromas and soft chatter.  Today, the air hung heavy with unspoken pressures, a tension thicker than the layers of nail polish Amelia painstakingly applied to her clients.  Sunlight, filtered through the dusty, floral-patterned curtains, cast long shadows across the rows of meticulously organized nail files and bottles of polish.  The aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingled with the sweet, almost cloying, scent of rosewater, a stark contrast to the impending storm brewing within the small, bustling salon.
