The rhythmic drumming of the rain seemed to mimic the insistent heartbeat echoing in her ears.  She wasn't sure what it was about this particular case, this particular client, that was unsettling her so profoundly.  The client, Kenji Tanaka, a renowned architect with a past shrouded in whispers of tragedy, had scheduled an appointment for tomorrow, a Friday. And the anxiety was starting today.
