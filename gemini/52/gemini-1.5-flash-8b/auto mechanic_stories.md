The greasy air hung heavy in the "Rusty Wrench," a tiny garage nestled between a used bookstore and a bakery that specialized in surprisingly delicious sourdough.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grime-coated windows.  This was the domain of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, auto mechanic extraordinaire – or, at least, that's what the regulars whispered amongst themselves.  Barty, a man whose hands, calloused and stained the color of burnt coffee, spoke less than most, but his wrench work spoke volumes.  He'd coaxed life back into sputtering engines and mended mangled metal with a practiced efficiency that bordered on the mystical.  Today, however, the air in the Rusty Wrench felt thick with a different sort of tension – a tension not of broken springs or seized pistons, but of something…personal.  A beat-up, midnight-blue Ford Mustang, its hood flung open like a wounded beast, sat centre-stage, the object of Barty's current silent struggle.
