The flickering neon sign of the Rusty Mug cast a sickly yellow glow on Amelia "Amy"  Fitzwilliam's face, highlighting the smudges of coffee that clung to her apron like stubborn freckles.  The air in the diner hung thick with the smells of stale grease, burnt sugar, and something vaguely floral, probably from the sickly sweet floral spray someone had inexplicably placed on the counter.  It was a Tuesday night, and the diner, usually buzzing with the low hum of conversation and clattering cutlery, was eerily quiet.  Only the rhythmic *click-clack* of Amy's heels against the linoleum punctuated the stillness.


The Rusty Mug, nestled in the heart of the forgotten industrial district, was a relic of a bygone era.  Rows of mismatched booths, each bearing the faint scars of countless spilled drinks and whispered secrets, lined the walls.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light filtering through a grimy window, illuminating chipped paint and the faded grandeur of faded posters featuring long-forgotten rock bands.  A faded mural of a roaring motorcycle, painted in vibrant blues and golds, dominated one wall, a stark contrast to the muted tones of the rest of the establishment.  A faint hum from the old refrigerator in the back, a ghostly reminder of the lost dreams and hopes that lingered within the diner's chipped walls, whispered through the silence.
