The sterile white of the exam room seemed to press in on Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez, a suffocating blanket despite the open window letting in a weak gust of autumn air.  Outside, the vibrant hues of the maple trees lining Elm Street had surrendered to a muted palette of burnt orange and russet, mirroring the weariness that clung to her.  Amy, a Physician's Assistant at the bustling Riverside General Hospital, ran a hand over her already-tired eyes.  Another long day, another flurry of diagnoses and prescriptions, another patient whose whispered anxieties echoed in the silence between the rhythmic ticking of the clock and the soft hum of the nearby machinery.  Today, it was a 78-year-old woman named Mrs. Henderson, complaining of persistent chest pains and general malaise.  Amy knew, with a sinking feeling that wouldn't dissipate, that the routine bloodwork and electrocardiogram weren't going to provide the answers. The setting sun cast long shadows across the room, making the sterile white walls seem even more stark, a stark contrast to the subtle, yet palpable, sense of dread that gnawed at her.  The quiet hum of the machines and the rhythmic breathing of Mrs. Henderson were both familiar and menacing. Something about this case, this patient, felt off.
