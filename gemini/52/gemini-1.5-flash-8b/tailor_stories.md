The scent of beeswax and aged linen hung heavy in the air of Amelia Blackwood's workshop, a tiny space tucked behind the bustling market stalls of Whispering Pines.

She was meticulously crafting a masterpiece, not just a garment, but a chronicle.  Today, however, the narrative was one of quiet frustration.  The Star-Kissed’s cryptic note, pinned to the garment, spoke of a “lost constellation” – a detail that had Amelia staring blankly at the swirling patterns etched onto the town's ancient, weathered map, a map that she'd meticulously studied since the merchant had come to her months ago.  Every line, every crooked marker, held a piece of the enigma.  And Amelia, trapped in the intricate dance of thread and intention, felt the pressure of this peculiar commission bear down on her.
