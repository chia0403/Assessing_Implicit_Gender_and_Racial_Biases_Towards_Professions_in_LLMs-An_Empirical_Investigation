The biting wind howled through the narrow alleyways of the Lower East Side, whipping Amelia "Pip"  Fitzwilliam's threadbare jacket around her.  Rain, the consistency of icy shards, hammered against the corrugated iron roof above, a relentless counterpoint to the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Pip's heart.  She squinted, her breath fogging in the frigid air, her gloved hands clutching the worn leather satchel that held the tools of her trade – a collection of wrenches, pipes, and the surprisingly essential, miniature Swiss army knife that always seemed to come in handy.  The flickering neon sign of the "Grimy Gus's Grub" cafe, across the way, offered little warmth; it was an eerie glow against the skeletal architecture of the buildings, each brick a testament to time and neglect. Pip, twenty-seven years old and practically a fixture in this forgotten corner of New York, was late.  Critically late.  Late for a plumbing job that could very well determine the next few months of her meagre existence.  The apartment, tucked away at the back of a ramshackle tenement, was rumored to house the city's most demanding tenant and the most complicated plumbing nightmares imaginable.  This particular job held the key to survival, to more than just keeping the pipes from bursting – it was a key to her future.
