The fluorescent lights of the Grand Zenith Library hummed, a monotonous drone that was Elias Thorne's only constant companion.  Dust motes danced in the sliver of afternoon sunlight piercing the grime-streaked window of the forgotten stacks.  Elias, a man whose uniform – a faded grey polo and practical work pants – seemed to absorb the library's quiet despair, pushed a battered cart laden with discarded newspapers and overflowing bins of discarded paper.  The scent of aged paper, mingled with the faint, lingering perfume of jasmine from a long-forgotten book, clung to the air.  He was, as usual, alone in the cavernous expanse of the library, a vast, echoing labyrinth of knowledge, now haunted only by the rustle of his cleaning cloth and the rhythmic clatter of his cart.

**Setting:** The Grand Zenith Library, a towering, historic structure in the heart of a once-thriving but now decaying city.  Vast, sun-drenched reading rooms now echo with the quiet whisper of forgotten dreams.  Dust motes dance in the fading light, illuminating intricate, centuries-old carvings on the library's ornate arches.  Hidden alcoves and labyrinthine stacks hold secrets untold, whispering tales of forgotten scholars and lost knowledge.  The library's grandeur conceals a subtle decay, mirroring the city's own slow decline.
