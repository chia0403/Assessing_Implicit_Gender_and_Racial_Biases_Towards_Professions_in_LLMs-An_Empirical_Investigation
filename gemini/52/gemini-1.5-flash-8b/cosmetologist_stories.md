The scent of lavender and ozone hung heavy in the air of "Aura," a salon tucked away on a cobbled side street in the heart of the bustling, yet strangely quiet, city of Veridia.  Sunlight, fractured by the ornate stained-glass window above the reception desk, painted shifting patterns across the polished floors.  Amelia Evelyn Blackwood, a cosmetologist with eyes the colour of polished amethyst and a smile that could melt glaciers, meticulously trimmed a particularly stubborn strand of auburn hair.  A symphony of gentle clippers and the soft hum of conversation, punctuated by the occasional melodic chime from a vintage grandfather clock in the corner, filled the space.  Veridia, known for its intricate artistry and meticulously maintained facades, also held a hidden underbelly of whispered secrets and forgotten desires.  Amelia, however, was content with the quiet rhythm of her work, a world apart from the city's murmurings. This afternoon, though, the silence feltâ€¦wrong.
