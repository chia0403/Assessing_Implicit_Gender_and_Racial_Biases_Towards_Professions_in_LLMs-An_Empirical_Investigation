The biting wind whipped Amelia Hawthorne's crimson scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks as she surveyed the frozen expanse of the hockey rink.  Frost, thick as powdered sugar, coated the boards, obscuring the lines of the game.  Beyond the ice, the sprawling, snow-dusted campus of Blackwood Academy – a prestigious prep school nestled deep within the Vermont mountains – stretched out, a silent, snow-covered monument to the unforgiving winter.  The air, crisp and clear, held a palpable tension, a shared anticipation humming between the bundled figures huddled around the concession stand and the hushed, expectant silence within the arena itself.  Amelia, Head Coach of the Blackwood Academy Blackhawks, felt a familiar knot of anxiety tighten in her stomach.  This wasn't just any game; this was the final of the Northeast Regional Championship, a game that could make or break the team's season.
