The flickering neon sign of the "Golden Reel" cast a sickly yellow glow across the rain-slicked streets of Neo-Kyoto.  Water pooled in the alleyways, reflecting the fractured glass of a shattered storefront, a fitting metaphor for the turmoil swirling within Elias Thorne, a renowned, if somewhat troubled, movie director.  Elias Thorne, a man whose films were lauded for their visceral imagery and unconventional narratives, found himself more than a little lost in this city of ancient temples and futuristic skyscrapers.  His latest project, a biopic of a forgotten samurai-ninja hybrid, was due to begin filming in a mere fortnight.  However, amidst the meticulous planning, the meticulously crafted pre-production documents, and the ceaseless buzzing of his assistant's phone, Elias felt an unsettling sense of dread. Not for the project itself, but for the emptiness within.  This city, though a haven for cinematic inspiration, felt strangely uninviting, almost a mirror reflecting his own fractured psyche.
