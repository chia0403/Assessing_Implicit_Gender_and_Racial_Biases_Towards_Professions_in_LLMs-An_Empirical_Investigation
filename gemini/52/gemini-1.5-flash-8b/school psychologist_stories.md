The fluorescent lights of Northwood High hummed, a relentless drone that mirrored the ceaseless anxieties swirling in Dr. Eleanor Vance's mind.  It was Tuesday, the day of the "Back to Basics" seminar, and the air in the school psychologist's office, usually a sanctuary of muted tones and calming artwork, felt thick with unspoken fears.  A half-eaten granola bar sat on her desk, a testament to the fragmented focus of the previous hours.  Outside, the autumn leaves crunched underfoot, a brittle sound mirroring the fragility she sensed in some of her students.

Eleanor Vance, a seasoned school psychologist with five years' experience, stared at the stack of student files.  Each file was a miniature biography, a record of triumphs and traumas, hopes and hurts.  Among them, a particular file, labelled "A.J. Hernandez," felt heavier than the others.  A.J. was a junior struggling with both academic pressure and a burgeoning sense of social isolation.  The school year was rapidly approaching its mid-point, and Eleanor felt a tightening in her chest, a premonition of the storms yet to come.  

The setting was the small, but well-worn, psychologist's office at Northwood High.  Northwood, nestled in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains, was a town grappling with rapid development, and the resulting pressures on its youth.  The school, a sprawling brick edifice, housed a diverse population struggling to find their place.  The crisp autumn air carried the scent of pine needles and distant woodsmoke from the nearby cabins and homesteads.  Eleanor's office window offered a limited view of the sprawling schoolyard, where students were already gathering for the day's activities.  The muted yellows and oranges of the falling leaves painted a backdrop to the psychological landscape of the school's halls.
