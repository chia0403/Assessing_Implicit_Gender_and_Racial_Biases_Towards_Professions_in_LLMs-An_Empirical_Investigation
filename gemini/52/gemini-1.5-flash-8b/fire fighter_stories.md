The biting wind whipped Amelia Hayes's crimson fire-resistant coat around her legs, stinging her cheeks like a thousand tiny needles.  Below, the skeletal remains of the old Victorian, "The Nightingale," groaned under the relentless assault of the storm.  Flames, a furious, orange heart in the inky twilight, still licked at the roofline, casting long, dancing shadows across the rain-slicked cobblestones.  Amelia, her name a whispered prayer against the howling wind, gripped the rusted iron railing of the fire escape.  Below, the splintered wood and the acrid scent of burning pine filled the air, a suffocating, familiar blend. This was her tenth fire in as many weeks.  Tenth, and the city seemed to shrink, its once vibrant heartbeat now a constant thrum of disaster.

The setting:  Emberton, a sprawling, grey metropolis built upon the ashes of countless forgotten fires.  Tall, soot-stained buildings, their once-proud facades now scarred and weathered, clawed at the bruised sky.  The city pulsed with a subterranean energy â€“ the faint, low rumble of the city's hidden machinery, the constant, rhythmic hiss of steam escaping from forgotten pipes.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roofs, a relentless percussion.  The flickering gaslights cast long, distorted shadows on the streets below, giving the scene a haunting, otherworldly quality.  Inside the old Victorian, which had always stood apart with its ornate gingerbread detailing,  a terrible tragedy was unfolding.
