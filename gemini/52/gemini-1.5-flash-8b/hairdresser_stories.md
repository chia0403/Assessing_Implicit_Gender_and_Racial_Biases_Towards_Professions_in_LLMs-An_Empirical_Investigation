The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual grey-green from years of lukewarm water and forgotten rinses, reflected the harsh fluorescent light of "Scissors & Smiles."  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun that pierced the grime-streaked window, illuminating a tangle of brightly coloured foils and discarded bobby pins.  Agnes Periwinkle, her name a whisper of forgotten poetry etched onto the faded salon sign, carefully snipped a stray strand of auburn hair.  The rhythmic *snip* resonated with the muted buzz of a nearby conversation, the clatter of a dropped comb, and the distant wail of a siren that seemed to echo the loneliness clinging to the corners of the room.  Agnes, her fingers nimble despite the tremor that ran through them, knew this was a familiar symphony. This was her world.
 
The salon, nestled on a forgotten side street of Willow Creek, was a testament to the enduring power of quiet dignity.  Cream-coloured walls, once vibrant, were now faded and scratched, mirroring the weary resilience of the small town around it.  A worn floral wallpaper clung precariously to the stairwell leading up to the tiny, cramped apartment Agnes lived above the salon, the only space left in the once bustling city.  Willow Creek, a town of dusty sidewalks and whispered secrets, had witnessed Agnes's years of quiet service, her scissors always poised to snip the threads of sorrow and celebrate the blossoms of joy.
