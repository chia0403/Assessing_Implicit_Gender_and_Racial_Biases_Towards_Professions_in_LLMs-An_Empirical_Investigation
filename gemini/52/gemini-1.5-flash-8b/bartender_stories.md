The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow on Amelia Petrova's face, highlighting the exhaustion etched into her tired eyes.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light slicing through the smoky haze of the dimly lit bar.  Empty beer glasses, chipped mugs, and the remnants of spilled cocktails littered the worn mahogany bar like fallen leaves in autumn.  The air, thick with the scent of stale cigarettes and cheap whiskey, hung heavy in the silence, punctuated only by the rhythmic clinking of Ameliaâ€™s ice-filled shaker.

The Rusty Mug wasn't exactly a thriving establishment.  Tucked away on a forgotten corner of the city, swallowed by the shadow of the towering skyscrapers that dominated the skyline, it was a relic from a bygone era.  Its clientele, a motley crew of down-on-their-luck souls, regulars who had frequented the bar for decades, and tourists who stumbled in hoping for an authentic slice of a forgotten world, were few and far between. Tonight, however, a lone figure sat hunched over a small table in the back corner, shrouded in the shadows, stirring a drink with nervous intensity.
