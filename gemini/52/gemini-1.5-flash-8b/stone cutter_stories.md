The biting wind whipped around Elara Blackwood, stinging her cheeks and raising icy tendrils in her braided hair.  Dust, kicked up by the relentless wind, swirled like a pale fog around the jagged peaks of the Silvan Mountains.  High above, the grey sky threatened a storm, a harbinger of the tumultuous weather that often plagued the craggy valleys of the Stonehaven region.  Elara, her calloused hands gripping the chipped handle of her pickaxe, hunched deeper into the shelter of the overhanging cliff face.  Sunlight, weak and filtered through the swirling mist, barely touched the rough-hewn stone quarry where she worked.

Elara Blackwood, a stone cutter for nearly twenty years, had seen more of the Silvan Mountains than most.  She knew the valleys like the lines etched in her own weathered hands, the veins of quartz that glimmered like buried starlight, the hidden cracks that whispered tales of ancient battles and forgotten gods.  This particular quarry, however, held a deeper, more unsettling energy.  For weeks, a low, guttural humming had resonated from beneath the stone, a sound that seemed to vibrate not just through the earth, but through her very bones.  The humming grew louder with every passing day, a rhythmic pulse that echoed Elara's own frantic heartbeat.
