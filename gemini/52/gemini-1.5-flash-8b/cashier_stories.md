The fluorescent hum of the "Corner Grocer" reverberated through Amelia Blackwood's ears, a constant, low thrum that seemed to seep into her very bones.  Every aisle, every shelf, seemed to groan under the weight of pre-packaged perfection.  Canned goods, gleaming plastic wrap, and rows of identical pasta boxes lined the walls, creating a sterile, almost oppressive environment. Amelia, twenty-two years old and sporting a slightly-too-tight, faded grey uniform, moved silently through the quiet afternoon, the only sound the rhythmic *clink* of coins in her overflowing till.  This was her third hour at the register, and the rhythmic monotony was starting to feel like a suffocating embrace.  The town of Oakhaven, nestled in the foothills of the Whispering Mountains, felt equally suffocating.  The air, thick with the scent of pine and something slightly acrid, hung heavy and still.  A single, skeletal oak tree stood sentinel outside the back door, its branches reaching out like skeletal fingers to the relentless grey sky.  Amelia knew this was a place of fleeting seasons and slower-than-snail-pace lives.  Sheâ€™d only been there for a month, and she already felt a growing sense of rootlessness.
