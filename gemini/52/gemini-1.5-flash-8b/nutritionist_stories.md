The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Grace Thornton's hands, a comforting weight against the biting November wind that howled like a hungry wolf outside her tiny, sun-drenched office.  Sunlight, fractured by the frosted windowpane, painted the dust motes dancing in the air with iridescent colours.  Amelia, a registered dietitian with a passion for holistic nutrition and a knack for crafting colourful, flavourful meals, meticulously stirred her chamomile tea.  Outside, the vibrant tapestry of autumn leaves had surrendered to the encroaching winter, leaving the world a monochrome canvas of grey and brown.  Her small, cluttered office, nestled in a quiet corner of the historic Oakhaven district, was a stark contrast – a kaleidoscope of colourful cookbooks, overflowing baskets of herbs, and vibrant posters of locally grown fruits and vegetables.  Amelia's desk, though organised with meticulous precision, held a collection of crumpled notes, scribbled recipes, and countless small containers filled with dried herbs, nuts, and seeds – remnants of her whirlwind day. Today, however, was quieter, allowing her to pause and consider a perplexing case.
