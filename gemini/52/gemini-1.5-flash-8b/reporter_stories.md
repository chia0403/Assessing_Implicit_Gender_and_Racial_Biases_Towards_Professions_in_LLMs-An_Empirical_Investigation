The flickering neon sign of the "Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow across Amelia  "Amy"  Fitzwilliam's rain-slicked face.  The air, thick with the smell of stale coffee and desperation, hung heavy in the alleyway.  The chipped paint of the building, a testament to years of neglect, mirrored the weariness etched onto Amy's features.  She was a reporter for the *Crimson Chronicle*, a struggling paper that clung to life by the threadbare edges of the city's heart. Tonight, however, even the Chronicle seemed a distant, hazy memory.  The city itself felt fractured, its arteries choked with rumours and rumors, and Amy, pressed against the grimy brick wall, felt like a lone, desperate blood cell in a clotted vein.

The setting was the underbelly of Oakhaven, a city notorious for its decaying grandeur and equally notorious underbelly.  Narrow alleyways choked with discarded debris snaked between towering, once-elegant buildings now scarred by time and neglect.  The air, often thick with the metallic tang of industrial runoff, smelled different tonight, more acrid, hinting at something hidden, something rotten. The city's pulse, normally a thrumming rhythm of commerce and hurried feet, was muted tonight, replaced by a low, unsettling hum.  Amy's heart mirrored the city's rhythmâ€”heavy, slow, and uncertain.
