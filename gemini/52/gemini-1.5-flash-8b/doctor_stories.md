The biting wind whipped across the exposed moorland, stinging Dr. Alistair Finch’s cheeks.  The low, guttural groan of the wind seemed to echo the churning unease in his stomach.  He clutched the worn leather-bound journal tighter, the faint scent of aged parchment mingling with the acrid tang of peat smoke.  Alistair, a general practitioner with a practice tucked away in the sleepy village of Oakhaven, was decidedly out of his element.  He wasn't here for a patient. He was here for answers.  

The setting was the desolate, windswept expanse of the Grampian Mountains, Scotland, a place where the harsh beauty of nature seemed to mirror the unyielding mysteries it held.  The grey mist clung to the crags and valleys like a shroud, obscuring the path ahead and muffling the sounds of the wild.  Alistair was trudging uphill, the steep incline testing his already weary limbs.  Towering crags, carved by millennia of icy wind and rain, rose dramatically from the boggy ground.  Small, skeletal trees clung desperately to the exposed earth, battling against the relentless elements.  He'd come to this forsaken part of the Highlands in search of a lost legend – a tale whispered among the local folk, a tale that spoke of a forgotten cure.  A cure for the encroaching sickness plaguing his village.
