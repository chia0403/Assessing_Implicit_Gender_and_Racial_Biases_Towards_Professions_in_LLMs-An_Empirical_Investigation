The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Numbers & Nuggets" accounting firm cast long, distorted shadows across Amelia Hawthorne's meticulously organized desk.  Paperclips, meticulously arranged by size, glinted like tiny, silver stars.  A half-eaten granola bar, its cardboard wrapper meticulously crumpled, sat beside a stack of invoices labelled "Q3 2024 - Client: Acme Industries."  Outside, the grey London sky threatened rain, mirroring the gloom that had settled over Amelia's mood.  She was drowning in spreadsheets, each row and column a silent testament to the relentless demands of her job as a senior accountant.  The comforting routine of balancing ledgers and reconciling accounts felt suffocating.  A nagging feeling of impending doom, a phantom headache, pressed against her temples.  It had been a week of late nights, and the familiar scent of burnt coffee mingled with the faint aroma of anxiety.  The pressure to hit the quarterly targets was mounting, and Amelia was starting to wonder if she could keep up the pace without cracking under the strain.  Her neatly-kept world, built on precision and order, felt increasingly precarious.
