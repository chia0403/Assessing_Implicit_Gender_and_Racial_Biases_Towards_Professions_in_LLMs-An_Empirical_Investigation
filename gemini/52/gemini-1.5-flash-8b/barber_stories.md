The chipped paint of the "Razor's Edge" barbershop clung to the peeling plaster like a stubborn, forgotten dream.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight slicing through the grime-coated window, illuminating the faded floral wallpaper.  This was Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's domain, a haven of quiet chaos where the scent of sandalwood and freshly cut hair mingled with the faint aroma of stale coffee and the rhythmic hum of a vintage electric razor.  Barty, a man whose salt-and-pepper beard rivaled the weathered wood of the barber's chair he sat in, was meticulously sharpening his straight razor, the glint catching the sunbeam like a tiny, dangerous star.  Outside, the cacophony of the city – honking taxis, chattering vendors, the distant wail of a siren – faded into a muted roar, barely a whisper in this sanctuary of quiet precision.  Barty sighed, a puff of air that momentarily disturbed the settled dust, and continued his task, his movements practiced, almost ritualistic.  Today, though, the usual rhythm felt off-kilter.  Something, he sensed, was about to change.
