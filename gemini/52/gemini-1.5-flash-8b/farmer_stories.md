The biting wind, a relentless harbinger of winter, whipped across the parched, ochre-coloured fields of the  Ashwood Valley.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of dried earth, danced across the cracked topsoil, obscuring the skeletal remains of last year's crops.  Elias Thorne, a weathered farmer with hands like knotted oak branches and eyes the colour of a stormy sea, hunched deeper into his worn sheepskin coat.

This, he thought, was not how it was meant to be.  This was not the bounty-laden Ashwood Valley he remembered.  This was a valley struggling for breath.
