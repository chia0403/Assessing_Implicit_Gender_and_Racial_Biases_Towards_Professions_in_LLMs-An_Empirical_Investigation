The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Blackwood's hands, the lukewarm coffee doing little to combat the gnawing chill that permeated the office.  Rain lashed against the oversized windows of "Northshire Insurance," a building that seemed to absorb sound as much as light.  Grey skies mirrored the leaden weight settling on Amelia's chest.  It was a Tuesday, the kind that swallowed bright promises whole, leaving behind only the lingering scent of disappointment and damp wool.  The stale air in the small, windowless office smelled faintly of old paper and fear.  Amelia, a diligent, if somewhat introverted, insurance agent, adjusted her glasses, the thin wire rims digging into her temples.  She was staring at a stack of claim forms, each one a miniature tragedy, a story of shattered hopes and broken things.  Today, more than usual, the tales whispered through the forms seemed to cling to her, refusing to be detached.  She was utterly alone in the office, the rest of the staff presumably attending to other, more exciting, clients. A single flickering fluorescent light hummed above her, a stark contrast to the looming shadows of the coming winter.
