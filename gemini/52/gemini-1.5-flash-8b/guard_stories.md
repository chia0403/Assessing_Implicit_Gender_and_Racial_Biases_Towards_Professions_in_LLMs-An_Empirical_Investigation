The biting wind, a constant companion to Seraphina Blackwood's existence, whipped at the crumbling stone walls of the Citadel of Aethelgard.  Dust, kicked up by unseen creatures in the shadowed reaches of the obsidian-streaked mountains, stung her eyes.  For the tenth time that dawn, she adjusted the battered leather straps of her armour, the cold metal a familiar comfort against her skin.  The Citadel, once a beacon of shimmering opulence, now resembled a weathered, skeletal hand clawing at the heavens.  The year was 1472 of the Broken Sun.  Seraphina, her face etched with the lines of hardship and shadowed by the deep weariness of unending patrols, surveyed the barren landscape.  The city, now a ghost town of whispering ruins, stretched out beneath the unforgiving grey sky, a silent testament to the war that had consumed everything.  Her duty, as one of the last remaining guards of the Citadel, was to maintain the fragile peace, a peace more often threatened by the whispers of the encroaching darkness than by open conflict.
