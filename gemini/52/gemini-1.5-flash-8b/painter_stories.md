The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's crimson shawl around her, stinging her cheeks like a thousand tiny needles.  Grey clouds, bruised and heavy, pressed against the leaden sky, mirroring the mood in her heart.  Below, the cobbled streets of Montmartre, usually a vibrant tapestry of colour and life, were shrouded in a melancholy silence.  This particular Tuesday felt as though the very soul of Paris was holding its breath.  Amelia, hunched against the chill, found solace only in the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of her own heart against her ribs, a counterpoint to the city's subdued pulse. She was a painter, a restless soul eternally chasing fleeting moments of inspiration, and this particular corner of the Place du Tertre felt, for the first time in weeks, completely devoid of it.  Her easel, a weathered mahogany stand, stood neglected beside her, its canvas blank, a stark mirror to the empty space within her.  The aroma of roasted chestnuts, usually a comforting prelude to the evening's artistic fervor, had lost its allure. This Tuesday, the city held its breath.
