The sterile white of the hospital hallway, a stark contrast to the bruised purple of the late afternoon sky outside, reflected Amelia Hawthorne's weary expression.  Rain hammered against the glass windows, mirroring the relentless rhythm of her pulse.  Amelia, a Registered Nurse with five years' experience at St. Jude's General, felt the familiar knot tightening in her stomach.  She was on her third patient transfer of the shift, and each one felt heavier than the last.  Tonight's assignment was particularly fraught.  Patient 347, Mr. Silas Blackwood, was deteriorating rapidly, his breaths shallow and ragged, his skin clammy despite the efforts of the nurses and technicians.  The ICU door, usually a beacon of hope, seemed tonight to be a closed tomb.  The hushed whispers of the other nurses, their concern palpable even through the protective masks, only compounded her anxiety.
