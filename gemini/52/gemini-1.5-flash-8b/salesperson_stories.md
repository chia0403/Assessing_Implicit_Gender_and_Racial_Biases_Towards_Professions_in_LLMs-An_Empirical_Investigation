The fluorescent lights of the "Everything You Need, Guaranteed!" mega-store hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia Hawthorne's day.  Dust motes danced in the harsh glare, reflecting off the polished surfaces of the countless, identical display cases showcasing the latest in ergonomic desk chairs.  Amelia, a third-year salesperson at the sprawling retail behemoth, felt the familiar pang of existential dread.  Another Saturday, another mountain of chairs, another sea of blank stares from potential customers.  The air, thick with the scent of synthetic leather and cheap cologne, felt suffocating.  The store, a vast labyrinth of aisles and interconnected departments, stretched into an endless expanse, an architectural testament to consumerism's insatiable appetite.  Amelia adjusted her perfectly pressed, beige uniform, a subtle splash of lavender peeking from beneath the collar.  This was her life:  a carefully constructed facade of polite smiles and manufactured enthusiasm, all in the service of selling uncomfortable chairs to people who probably didn't need them.
