The biting November wind whipped across the deserted docks, stinging Detective Isabella "Izzy" Diaz's cheeks.  Rain, a relentless curtain of grey, plastered the weathered wood of the pier to her jacket, leaving a film of icy condensation that mirrored the emptiness swirling around her.  The rusted skeletal remains of fishing boats, ghosts of a once-bustling harbor,  dotted the scene like discarded memories.  The air, thick with the smell of salt and decaying seaweed, hung heavy, mirroring the weight in Izzy's chest.  This was the forgotten corner of Port Blackwood, the place where whispered rumours took root and festered into chilling realities.  It was here, amidst the skeletal remains of the past, that she was supposed to find answers.

Port Blackwood, a sprawling port city choked by the industrial heritage of its past, now wrestled with a quiet desperation.  The great shipping lanes that once pulsed with life were now choked by bureaucratic red tape and falling fortunes.  The city, once a beacon of maritime ambition, now felt more like a forgotten relic, a faded postcard of a bygone era.  The docks, the very heart of Port Blackwood's identity, were now places where shadows danced and secrets hid in the forgotten corners.  Izzy knew that the truth, like the tide, ebbed and flowed in these places, leaving behind a trail of cryptic clues for those brave enough to follow.
