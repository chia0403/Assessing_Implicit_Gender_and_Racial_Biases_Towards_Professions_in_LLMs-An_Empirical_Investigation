The biting wind, a relentless razor against Amelia "Amy"  Everhart's cheeks, whipped across the desolate expanse of the Mojave Desert.  Dust devils danced across the cracked earth, mimicking the frantic jitters in her stomach.  Below, the shimmering heat haze swallowed the cracked asphalt ribbon of Highway 395, a forgotten artery in this sun-scorched wasteland.  Amy, her calloused hands gripping the worn leather controls of her single-engine Cessna 172, "The Wanderer," felt the familiar, rhythmic thrum of the Lycoming engine, a reassuring heartbeat against the oppressive silence of the empty sky.  

Her destination: the remote, almost mythical town of Harmony Gulch, nestled deep within the treacherous canyons.  A rumour, whispered through the pilot community, spoke of a distress call, a desperate plea from a lost soul trapped within those canyons.  Amy, a pilot with a thirst for the unknown, and a heart that always tilted towards the underdog, had no choice but to answer.  She knew the canyons, the merciless winds, the blistering heat, and the unforgiving landscape as well as any lost soul did.  This was home in a way few others could understand, a home built on the unforgiving beauty of a land that often took more than it gave.
