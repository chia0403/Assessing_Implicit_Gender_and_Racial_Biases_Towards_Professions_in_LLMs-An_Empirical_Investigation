The biting wind whipped across the exposed steel framework of the skyscraper, stinging Elias Thorne's cheeks.  He hunched deeper into his oversized safety jacket, the fluorescent lights of the construction site blurring into a hazy halo around him.  Dust, the colour of aged parchment, coated everything â€“ the scaffolding, the steel beams, even the air itself.  He was at the very peak of the building, a dizzying height above the bustling city of Veridian, a city that felt impossibly far below.  The concrete jungle, a tapestry woven from towering structures and winding streets, stretched out before him, a chaotic symphony of life humming in the valley.

Elias Thorne, thirty-two years old, was a journeyman concrete worker.  His calloused hands, scarred with the tales of countless poured slabs and hammered rebars, were now clenched tight around the rusted metal cable.  He was on his usual midnight shift, a time when the city surrendered to sleep, offering him the quiet solitude he needed.  This particular skyscraper, the Zenith Tower, was a monument to ambition, a testament to the relentless pursuit of progress.  Tonight, however, it felt like a monument to something else, something more unsettling.  A silent, lingering unease had settled in the air, a thick mist that clung to the towering structure and refused to dissipate.  A faint, almost imperceptible hum seemed to emanate from the core of the building, a sound that sent shivers down his spine, a sound that hinted at something... more.
