The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine and something faintly metallic, a smell Dr. Anya Petrova couldn't quite place.  She pushed open the heavy wooden door of the clinic, the ornate carvings whispering tales of bygone eras.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom of the waiting room, illuminating a faded Persian rug and a half-dozen figures draped in traditional Afghan clothing.  Anya, dressed in her crisp, tailored linen suit, felt a familiar flutter of apprehension.  This was the remote village of Kandahar, nestled in the foothills of the Himalayas, a world away from the sterile efficiency of her London clinic.  Her new assignment – a nutritional intervention program for children suffering from malnutrition –  was far more challenging than the meticulously crafted spreadsheets and patient consultations she'd become accustomed to.  The silent, judging gazes of the villagers felt like a tangible weight pressing down on her shoulders.  Anya glanced at the faded clock on the wall, a testament to the village's timekeeping traditions – numerals etched onto the face instead of hands – and sighed.  The day had barely begun, and already she felt utterly adrift.
