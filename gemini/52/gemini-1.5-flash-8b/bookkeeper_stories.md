The chipped Formica countertop gleamed under the fluorescent hum of the accounting office, a stark contrast to the dusty, leather-bound volumes that lined the shelves.  Rain hammered against the windowpanes of the second-floor office, mimicking the relentless tapping of Amelia Blackwood's fingers on the worn keyboard.  Amelia, a bookkeeper with a precise, almost mathematical mind, meticulously entered invoices, each number a tiny, silent whisper against the cacophony of the storm.  The year was 1938, and the scent of old paper and slightly stale coffee hung heavy in the air.  The office, nestled in the heart of a bustling, yet somewhat dilapidated, section of downtown Chicago, felt a world away from the glitz and glamour of the city's famous nightlife.  Amelia’s job at the "Reliable Records" was routine, yet each transaction, each carefully calculated entry, held the potential for a secret, or a hidden truth.  A missing ledger, misplaced receipts, a suspicious deposit – these were the silent puzzles that Amelia, day in and day out, wrestled with in the fading light of the office.
