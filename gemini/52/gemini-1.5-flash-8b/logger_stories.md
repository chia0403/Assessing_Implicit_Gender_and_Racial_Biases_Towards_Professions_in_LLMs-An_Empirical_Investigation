The biting wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the ancient redwoods, stinging Silas Blackwood's face.  He hunched deeper into his worn leather jacket, the scent of pine and damp earth a familiar balm against the icy air.  The jagged peaks of the Sierra Nevada, bruised purple in the fading light, loomed around him, a silent, watchful presence.  He was miles from the nearest ranger station, swallowed by the vast, unforgiving wilderness that was his domain. Silas Blackwood, seasoned logger and son of the forest, was alone, as always.

Setting:  The high country of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, late autumn.  The air is crisp and thin, carrying the scent of pine and damp earth.  A dense forest of towering redwood trees, thick with undergrowth and shrouded in mist, stretches as far as the eye can see.  Scattered throughout the forest are the remnants of old logging camps, silent witnesses to the relentless march of progress. A lone, icy stream rushes over rocks, carving a path through the wilderness.
