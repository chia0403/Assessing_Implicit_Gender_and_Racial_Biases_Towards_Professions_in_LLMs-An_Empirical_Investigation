The aroma of freshly baked sourdough, sharp and yeasty, clung to the air of the Rue des Bouchons, a narrow cobbled street in the heart of Paris.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun filtering through the grimy, multi-paned windows of the boulangerie, "Le Pain de Vie."  Inside,  Elodie Dubois, a baker with hands perpetually stained a rich, warm brown, meticulously shaped a baguette, her movements precise and practiced, a ballet of flour and dough.  The rhythmic clink of metal against metal, the hiss of steam from the warming ovens, and the low murmur of customers picking through the array of pastries formed a comforting symphony that was Elodie's world.  It was a world she loved, a world that held secrets deeper than the crust of a perfect croissant. Today, though, the symphony had a discordant note.  A peculiar chill had settled over the bakery, a feeling as unsettling as a sudden drop in temperature.
