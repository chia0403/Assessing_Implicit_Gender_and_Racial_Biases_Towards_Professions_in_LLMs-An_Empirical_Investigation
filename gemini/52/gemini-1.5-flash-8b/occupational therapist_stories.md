Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the dilapidated community centre, a rhythmic counterpoint to the rhythmic clicking of Amelia Kensington's pen.  The stale air, thick with the scent of damp earth and forgotten dreams, hung heavy in the small, cluttered office.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom, illuminating a scattering of colourful therapy aids – oversized blocks, brightly-patterned fabric strips, and a collection of oddly-shaped wooden toys – abandoned on a cluttered desk. Amelia, a seasoned occupational therapist with a mop of unruly brown hair escaping from a faded purple scarf, hunched over a stack of patient files.  The faded floral wallpaper, once vibrant, now bore the marks of countless years and countless tears.  Outside, the grey sky reflected the despondency mirroring the atmosphere inside the building.  This was the heart of the forgotten district, a place where the relentless cycle of poverty and hardship had etched deep furrows in the very souls of its residents.
