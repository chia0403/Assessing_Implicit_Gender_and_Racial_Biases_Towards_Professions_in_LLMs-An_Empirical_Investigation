The biting wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vance's coat around her legs, stinging her cheeks as she surveyed the desolate, snow-covered landscape.  The frozen river, a ribbon of glassy ice snaking through the valley, reflected the bruised purple twilight sky.  A lone, skeletal pine tree, its branches clawing at the darkening heavens, stood sentinel over the sprawling, deserted ranch.  Dust devils danced across the trampled snow, leaving wisps of fine ice in their wake.  This was the desolate heartland of the Wyoming outback, a place where the silence was a physical presence, punctuated only by the occasional mournful howl of a coyote.  It was a stark contrast to the vibrant, bustling animal clinics she’d grown up with in the bustling coastal towns of California.
