The fluorescent lights of Ms. Eleanor Vance's history classroom hummed, a constant, low thrum that vibrated through the chipped Formica of her desk.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun slanting through the grimy windowpanes, illuminating a half-eaten bag of stale pretzels and a stack of dog-eared textbooks.  September air, thick with the scent of damp earth and something vaguely chemical – possibly the cleaning supplies – hung heavy in the air.  Eleanor, a woman whose carefully curated cardigan hid a tremor in her hands, sighed, a sound like rustling autumn leaves.  She stared at the empty desks, each one a silent accusation of the day's lesson that had utterly failed to ignite any spark of interest.  This was her eleventh year teaching American Revolution at Northwood High.  Eleven years of meticulously researched lectures, passionate debates, and still…nothing.  Nothing but blank stares and the relentless, echoing silence of a classroom in which no one seemed to care about the past.
