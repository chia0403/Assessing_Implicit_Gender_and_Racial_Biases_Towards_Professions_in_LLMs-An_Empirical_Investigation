The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Sprocket" cast a sickly yellow glow on Amelia Cavendish's rain-slicked overalls.  Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of ozone and burnt popcorn â€“ a familiar, if not comforting, aroma.  Amelia, her name barely a whisper against the constant hum of the radio equipment, meticulously adjusted a dial, her calloused fingers dancing across the tangle of wires.  The old, repurposed radio shack, crammed with antiquated components and half-eaten sandwiches, was her sanctuary, her workshop, her world.  Outside, the relentless downpour pounded against the corrugated metal roof, a soundtrack to the rhythmic click-clack of her tools.  This was Port Blackwood, a coastal town clinging to the edge of the forgotten world, a place where the only things more rusted than the old fishing boats were the hopes and dreams of its inhabitants.  Amelia, radio technician extraordinaire, was its silent guardian, its unseen link to the outside.  Tonight, however, the link felt strangely frayed.
