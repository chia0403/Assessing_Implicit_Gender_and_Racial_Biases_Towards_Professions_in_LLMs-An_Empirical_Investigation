The faded paint of the building's facade told stories of a past prosperity, now just ghosts clinging to the decaying brick.  Inside, the reception area was a monument to the quiet struggles of the city’s forgotten corners – a stark contrast to the gleaming skyscrapers visible in the distance.  The flickering fluorescent lights cast a sickly yellow glow on the worn-out furniture and the labyrinth of overflowing file cabinets.  A faint hum, emanating from a struggling computer hidden beneath a pile of discarded papers, underscored the sense of quiet desperation.
