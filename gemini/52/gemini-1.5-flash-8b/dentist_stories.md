The fluorescent hum of Dr. Amelia Hayes's dental office, usually a comforting white noise, grated on her nerves.  Today, it felt like a relentless, mocking drone, echoing the hollow ache in her chest.  Rain hammered against the grimy, Georgian-era windows, mirroring the storm brewing inside her.  The waiting room, usually filled with the muffled chatter of anxious patients, was eerily quiet.  Only the rhythmic *click-click* of her high-heeled shoes on the polished linoleum punctuated the oppressive silence as she paced.  Outside, the city of Oakhaven, nestled between the towering, mist-shrouded peaks of the Blue Ridge Mountains, swathed itself in a grey blanket.  The vibrant tapestry of autumn colours, usually a spectacular spectacle, was muted, absorbed by the encroaching gloom.  Amelia, 32 and with a practiced, if slightly frayed, efficiency, was an expert at calming nerves.  But today, her own nerves were a tangled mess.
