The biting wind, a relentless whisper of icy despair, whipped across the manicured lawns of Blackwood Manor.  Snow, already a foot deep, swirled around Bartholomew "Barty" Finch as he wrestled with a stubborn, frozen rose bush.  The wrought iron gates, gleaming dully in the pale winter light, seemed to mock his efforts, their imposing silhouette reflecting the bleakness of the day.  Barty, a groundskeeper at Blackwood Manor for the past fifteen years, felt a familiar knot of frustration tighten in his chest.  This particular rose, a delicate shade of apricot named 'Hope's Embrace', refused to yield to his coaxing.  He'd tried everything:  wrapping it in burlap, applying a potent concoction of seaweed and honey, even coaxing it with whispered encouragement.  Nothing worked.  He sighed, the sound lost in the wind's mournful howl.  Blackwood Manor, a gothic masterpiece of crumbling grandeur, stood sentinel over the storm-tossed landscape, its many windows like vacant eyes staring into the heart of the tempest.  The air, thick with the scent of pine and impending frost, hung heavy with an unspoken mystery.
