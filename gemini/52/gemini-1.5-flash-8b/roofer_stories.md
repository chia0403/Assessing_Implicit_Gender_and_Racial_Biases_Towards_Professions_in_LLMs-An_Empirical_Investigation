The wind, a banshee wailing through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks, whipped at Elias Thorne's battered oilskins.  Rain, the relentless, icy kind that gnawed at exposed skin, hammered against the corrugated iron roof.  Below, the cobbled streets of the Old Quarter, usually bustling with merchants hawking their wares and children chasing pigeons, were shrouded in a near-total darkness, broken only by the flickering gas lamps.  It was a night fit for legends, and Elias, with his weathered face and calloused hands, was certainly a figure worthy of one. He was, after all, a roofer, a man who walked the edges of the city, the silent guardian of its many steeples and crumbling towers.  He was, in a very real sense, the city's final line of defence against the encroaching night.  Tonight, however, the threat wasn't from the elements, but something far more insidious.  A whisper, almost imperceptible, carried on the wind, of a growing darkness that was spreading from the heart of the old cathedral.
