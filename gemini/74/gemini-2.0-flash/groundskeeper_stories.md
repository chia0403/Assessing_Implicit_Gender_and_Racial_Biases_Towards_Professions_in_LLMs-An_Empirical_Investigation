The morning dew clung to the manicured lawns of Blackwood Estate like a thousand tiny, glittering jewels. A light mist hung in the air, softening the edges of the towering oaks and weeping willows that had stood sentinel over the property for centuries. The silence, punctuated only by the distant chirping of robins and the occasional rustle of leaves, was almost deafening. This was the time of day Elias Bartholomew Finch loved best; the estate, still slumbering, belonged solely to him.

Elias, his face etched with the map of a life spent outdoors, straightened from his task of edging the rose garden, the scent of damp earth and blooming hybrid teas filling his lungs. Blackwood Estate wasn't just a job for him; it was in his blood. His grandfather had been groundskeeper here, and his father before him. For three generations, the Finch family had tended to these grounds, nurtured its flora, and quietly, respectfully, witnessed its history unfold. But lately, Elias felt a shift, a disquiet that had nothing to do with the approaching autumn. It was something moreâ€¦ ominous.
