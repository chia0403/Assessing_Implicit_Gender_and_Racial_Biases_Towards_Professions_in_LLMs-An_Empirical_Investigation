The air hung thick and heavy, a cloying blanket of exhaust fumes and wilting honeysuckle.  Humid heat shimmered off the black asphalt, blurring the already hazy horizon.  Even the usually persistent cicadas seemed to be taking a midday siesta, their buzzing replaced by the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of oncoming eighteen-wheelers.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of grit and discarded candy wrappers, danced across the cracked median, testament to another sweltering July day on Interstate 95.

Ethan Riley Miller wiped the sweat from his brow with the back of his calloused hand, leaving a streak of grime across his forehead. He squinted at the faded orange cones he and his crew had painstakingly placed before starting their shift.  Each one represented a life, a buffer between the oblivious motorists hurtling by and the dangerous reality of their work.  Todayâ€™s task: patching a series of gaping potholes that had blossomed overnight, thanks to a particularly violent thunderstorm.  Ethan sighed, the sound lost in the roar of the passing traffic. Another day, another gamble against gravity, boredom, and the ever-present risk of becoming roadkill himself.
