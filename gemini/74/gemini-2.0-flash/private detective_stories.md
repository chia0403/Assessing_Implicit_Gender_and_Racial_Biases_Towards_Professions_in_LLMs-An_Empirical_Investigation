The insistent buzz of the office intercom ripped Leo Maxwell Sterling from a particularly vivid dream involving a dame in a canary yellow dress and a never-ending staircase. He groaned, pushing himself upright in his creaky swivel chair. The single, dusty beam of late afternoon sun slicing through the blinds painted stripes across the worn Persian rug he’d inherited from his grandfather, a rug that had likely seen more shady deals than a back alley poker game.

The air in Leo’s office, perched on the fourth floor of a crumbling brick building on Bleecker Street, hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and forgotten aspirations. Rain pattered against the grimy windowpane, mirroring the relentless drizzle that had been plaguing New York City for the better part of a week. Outside, the cacophony of the city – taxi horns, the rumbling subway, the distant wail of a siren – filtered through, a constant, restless soundtrack to his life. The room itself was a testament to a life lived on the margins of solvency. Overflowing ashtrays balanced precariously on stacks of dog-eared paperbacks, mostly Chandler and Hammett. A half-empty bottle of rye sat tucked away in the bottom drawer of his scarred oak desk, a loyal companion on those long, lonely nights when the city held its breath and the mysteries multiplied. It was a classic detective's office, a cliché even, but it was Leo's. And for better or worse, he was stuck with it.
