The bell above the door of "Shear Delight" jingled a cheerful, if somewhat rusty, melody, a stark contrast to the grimace etched onto Edgar Alistair Finch's face. The morning light, filtering through the dusty windowpane, illuminated the swirling dust motes dancing in the air, and unfortunately, also illuminated the cobwebs clinging to the corners of his meticulously arranged shelves. Edgar sighed, his breath fogging slightly in the chilly autumn air. October in Oakhaven was a beautiful thing, all vibrant reds and golds painting the hills surrounding the small town. But it was also a slow month for haircuts. Tourists were gone, tucked away in warmer climes, and the locals were battening down the hatches, their hair left to grow wild and unkempt until the festive season demanded a more presentable appearance.

Oakhaven itself was a relic, a charming anachronism nestled in the heart of the Appalachian Mountains. Its main street boasted a general store, a diner that smelled perpetually of bacon and despair, and Edgar's barber shop, "Shear Delight," a name Edgar's grandfather had chosen with a gusto he certainly didn't inherit. The buildings were all brick and wood, their paint chipped and faded, whispering stories of a boom town long past. Even the town square, usually bustling with activity during the summer months, felt eerily deserted, the fountain gurgling its lonely tune into the crisp air. Edgar, gazing out the window, couldn't help but feel a kindred spirit to the melancholic town, both of them aging, slightly forgotten, and clinging desperately to a past that refused to be forgotten.
