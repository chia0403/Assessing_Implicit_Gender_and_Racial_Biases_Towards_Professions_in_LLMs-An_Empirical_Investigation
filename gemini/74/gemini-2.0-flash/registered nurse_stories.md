## Story Opening:

The astringent scent of hand sanitizer did little to cut through the lingering aroma of stale coffee and suppressed panic that perpetually clung to the air in the Mercy General ER. Amelia Grace Davies, R.N., scrubbed her hands with more force than necessary, the harsh gel stinging the small cuts blooming on her knuckles. She glanced at the clock above the charge nurse's station. 2:17 AM. Another hour and forty-three minutes until the end of her shift. An eternity in ER time. A lifetime, potentially, for someone wheeled through those double doors.

She sighed, the sound lost in the rhythmic beeping of monitors and the muttered conversations of her colleagues. The relative quiet was deceptive, a deceptive calm before the storm that always seemed to hit in the wee hours. Amelia knew it. They all did.

A sudden shout pierced the semi-tranquility. "Code Blue! Room Three!"

Amelia’s breath hitched. Room Three. The elderly gentleman with the pneumonia and the DNR order. He was a fighter, though. Or, rather, he had been. She pulled on a fresh pair of gloves, her heart already pounding a frantic rhythm against her ribs, and raced toward the fray.

## Setting:

**Mercy General Hospital's Emergency Room, Portland, Oregon. Late October. 2:17 AM.**

The ER is a controlled chaos. The fluorescent lights hum, casting a sterile, almost clinical glow over the linoleum floors and pale green walls. A network of gurneys, occupied by patients in varying degrees of distress, are pushed and pulled through the crowded space. The air is thick with the sounds of beeping monitors, hushed conversations, urgent shouts, and the occasional sob.

A large, central nurse's station acts as the command center, staffed by a harried charge nurse juggling phone calls, patient assignments, and the constant demands of the medical staff. Around the perimeter are several smaller, partitioned rooms equipped with medical equipment – monitors, ventilators, crash carts.

The overall impression is one of organized urgency, a constant battle against time and the relentless onslaught of human suffering. The aroma is a potent cocktail of antiseptic, bodily fluids, and the faint, lingering scent of processed coffee – a testament to the long hours and relentless demands of the job. Outside, the rain that Portland is famous for drums against the windows, a constant reminder of the unforgiving world beyond the ER's protective (and perpetually stressful) embrace.
