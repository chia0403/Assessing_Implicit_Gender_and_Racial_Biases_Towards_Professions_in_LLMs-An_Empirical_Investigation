**Opening:**

The biting wind whipped around Eliza Jane Bellweather, stinging her cheeks and tugging at the edges of her scarf. November had arrived in Chicago with the subtlety of a freight train, and Eliza, perched on the edge of a frozen fountain in Grant Park, felt every gust of its displeasure. Her fingers, despite the thick gloves, were already numb as she flipped through her notepad, the pages filled with scribbled observations and hastily drawn sketches.

**Setting:**

The setting is a blustery, grey November morning in Chicago's Grant Park. The park, usually a vibrant green escape in the warmer months, is now a skeletal landscape of bare trees and dormant flowerbeds. The Buckingham Fountain, a majestic centerpiece, is drained and shrouded in protective coverings for the winter. In the distance, the towering skyscrapers of downtown Chicago loom, their glass facades reflecting the dull light of the overcast sky. The air smells of damp earth, exhaust fumes from Lake Shore Drive, and a faint, metallic tang from Lake Michigan, which stretches out endlessly to the east, its surface churned into choppy waves. Scattered around the park are a few hardy souls: joggers braving the cold, dog walkers bundled in layers of fleece, and the occasional tourist shivering while snapping pictures of the desolate scenery.
