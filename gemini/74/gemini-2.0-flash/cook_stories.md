The chipped enamel mug warmed Agatha Plumtree's hands as she stood on the rickety porch of her cottage, watching the dawn bleed across the Orkney Islands. A salty wind whipped her hair, the colour of faded ginger, around her face and carried the scent of peat smoke and the distant cries of gulls. The cottage, clinging precariously to the edge of a windswept cliff on the island of Rousay, was a testament to stubbornness, much like Agatha herself. Built from weathered stone and roofed with thick, layered turf, it had withstood centuries of North Atlantic gales.

Agatha Plumtree, at sixty-three years young, wasn't a native Orcadian. She’d arrived fifteen years ago, fleeing a life in London that had tasted increasingly bland, despite the spice racks filled with exotic aromas. Here, amongst the rugged beauty and the quiet solitude, she'd found a different kind of flavour – a richness that came from the earth, the sea, and the hard-won simplicity of island life. She'd turned the cottage into a haven, filled with the comforting smells of baking bread and simmering stews, a refuge from the unforgiving elements outside. Now, the first slivers of sunlight kissed the rolling green hills and cast long shadows from the ancient standing stones that dotted the landscape. It was the start of another day, another opportunity to coax magic from the humble ingredients that the islands offered. And today, Agatha knew, would be no ordinary day at all.
