## Story Opening:

The wrench slipped in Albert "Al" Bartholomew's sweaty palm, sending a sharp, echoing clang through the cavernous space beneath the Grand Majestic Theater. Al cursed under his breath, a string of inventive obscenities that would have made a seasoned sailor blush. Heâ€™d been wrestling with this corroded Victorian-era pipe for a solid two hours, and the blasted thing was winning. He wiped a smear of grime across his forehead, leaving a dark smudge that only emphasized the fatigue etched on his face. The smell of damp earth, mildew, and something indefinably *old* hung heavy in the air, a potent cocktail that clung to the back of his throat. He could almost taste the dust of forgotten performances and the lingering scent of long-gone actresses.

## Setting:

The subterranean labyrinth beneath the Grand Majestic Theater in the historic district of New Orleans. Brick walls, slick with moisture, snaked away into the gloom, illuminated only by the weak beam of Al's headlamp. Pipes, thick and gnarled with age, crisscrossed overhead like metallic vines, dripping with condensation that echoed eerily in the silence. Scattered along the damp floor were discarded props, remnants of theatrical productions long past: a broken porcelain doll, a tarnished silver candelabra, a single, dusty velvet slipper. The air was thick with the weight of history, a place where the whispers of the past seemed to cling to every surface, adding an unsettling ambiance to the already challenging plumbing job. This wasn't just any basement; it was a living, breathing relic of a bygone era, and Albert Bartholomew was its unwilling prisoner for the evening.
