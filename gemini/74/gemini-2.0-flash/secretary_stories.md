The clatter of Amelia Beatrice Worthington's keyboard was a small, persistent rebellion against the oppressive silence of the law firm. Outside, the rain hammered against the floor-to-ceiling windows of the 47th floor, blurring the already-distant lights of Chicago into smudged, melancholic streaks. It was past 9 PM, and Amelia was the only soul left in the Dewey, Cheatham & Howe legal labyrinth.

Her desk, a laminated expanse of faux mahogany, was littered with the detritus of the day: discarded memos riddled with Mr. Humphrey's indecipherable scribbles, a half-eaten protein bar, and a stack of legal briefs so thick they threatened to topple over. The air hung heavy with the faint scent of stale coffee and the phantom aroma of Mr. Humphrey's notorious pipe tobacco.

Amelia wasn't usually the last to leave. But tonight, she was battling the legal dragon â€“ specifically, transcribing Mr. Humphrey's dictation on the Henderson vs. Consolidated Conglomerates case. Each word felt like a small, dull pinprick, slowly draining her spirit. She was a secretary, yes, but she had dreams. Dreams that didn't involve deciphering the archaic jargon of corporate law. Dreams involving Parisian cafes, overflowing sketchbooks, and a future where the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of keys was replaced with the gentle scratch of charcoal on paper. For now, however, she was trapped, a captive audience to the storm outside and the endless legal wrangling within. And tonight, the storm inside her felt just as fierce.
