The tar was blistering, even at seven in the morning. A shimmering heat haze rose off the asphalt shingles, distorting the already blurry skyline of Providence, Rhode Island. Frank Anthony Petrocelli swore under his breath, wiping a bead of sweat that had the audacity to tickle his eyebrow before diving into the corner of his eye. He hated summer roofing. He hated the way the heat beat down, the way the tar stuck to his boots like stubborn gum, and the way the slightest misstep could turn a ten-foot drop into a hospital visit.

Today, Frank was perched atop the Victorian monstrosity at 12 Benefit Street. The house, all turrets and gables, belonged to a retired history professor named Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth, who, according to Frank’s boss, Mr. DiAngelo, was "a real pain in the ass but pays on time." Frank had already endured one lecture about the proper placement of copper flashing around a dormer, a lecture that involved more references to 18th-century building techniques than Frank cared to know.

Benefit Street, with its cobblestones and immaculately preserved houses, was beautiful, undeniably so. But right now, with the sun turning the tar into a sticky, molten mess, Frank just wanted to finish the job, get a cold beer, and escape the oppressive heat baking the old roofs of College Hill. He tightened his grip on his hammer, ready to nail down another shingle, and wished, not for the first time, that he'd chosen a different line of work. Maybe being a history professor wasn’t so bad after all. Except, no, he didn't have the patience for that either. He just wanted something… easier.
