## Story Opening:

The scent of sawdust and regret hung heavy in the air of the abandoned Bijou Theatre, a familiar perfume to Julian Alexander Davies. He traced a finger along the peeling velvet of a broken theatre seat, its crimson faded to a melancholic rose. Outside, the relentless Chicago rain drummed a mournful counterpoint to the silence within. Julian, once the city's darling theatrical director, now found himself a reluctant archaeologist of his own failed ambition. His breath fogged in the frigid air, each exhale a miniature ghost of grand pronouncements and star-struck hopes. He hadn't stepped foot in the Bijou in five years, not since *The Importance of Being Earnest* had been murdered, quite publicly, on this very stage. Now, the theatre had summoned him, not with applause or accolades, but with a cryptic phone call from a lawyer he barely remembered. He dreaded what secrets the Bijou was about to exhume.

## Setting:

**The Bijou Theatre:** A once-grand vaudeville and theatrical house, now decaying in a neglected corner of Chicago's Near North Side. Built in the roaring twenties, it boasts ornate plasterwork, faded murals depicting scenes from classic plays, and a cavernous proscenium arch that still seems to whisper promises of grandeur. The velvet seats are ripped and stained, the stage is covered in a thick layer of dust, and the air is thick with the scent of decay and forgotten dreams. The dressing rooms backstage are cluttered with remnants of past productions: tattered costumes, broken props, and the faint echo of laughter and heartbreak. Though neglected and crumbling, the Bijou still holds a ghostly charm, a reminder of a vibrant past and a potential, however faint, for resurrection. The location, sandwiched between a discount pawn shop and a perpetually closed dive bar, further isolates the theatre in a pocket of urban blight.
