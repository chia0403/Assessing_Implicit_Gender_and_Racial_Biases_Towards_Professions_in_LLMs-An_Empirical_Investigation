The fluorescent lights of the Zenith Paper & Packaging warehouse hummed a monotonous tune, a symphony of industrial blandness that Amelia Grace Hawthorne had grown intimately familiar with over the past five years. The air hung thick with the scent of cardboard dust and stale coffee, a perfume she’d begun to consider her signature. Outside, the January wind whipped through the industrial park, rattling the corrugated iron walls and threatening to tear the "Think Big, Sell Bigger!" motivational banner hanging precariously above the loading dock.

Amelia, however, was oblivious to the atmospheric gloom. She was too busy meticulously adjusting the angle of her laptop screen, ensuring the Zoom backdrop – a strategically blurred image of a lush, green forest – looked just unprofessional enough to appear authentic. Today was the day she landed the Peterson Plastics account. Or at least, that's what she kept repeating to herself, a mantra against the gnawing anxiety that threatened to swallow her whole. Failure wasn’t an option. Not this time. Not when her quota was higher than the stack of corrugated boxes destined for Boise. Today, Amelia Grace Hawthorne, Senior Account Executive at Zenith Paper & Packaging, was going to sell bigger than she ever had before.
