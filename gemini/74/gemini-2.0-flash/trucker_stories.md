The biting wind howled like a banshee escaped from hell, rattling the mud-caked windows of the 18-wheeler as it chewed its way through the icy expanse of the Montana wilderness. Dust devils of snow, more ice than fluff, danced across the desolate landscape, blurring the already faint line between the frost-covered asphalt and the frozen fields beyond. Inside the cab, swathed in the comforting scent of diesel and stale coffee, **Eleanor "Ellie" Maxine Riley** wrestled the steering wheel, her knuckles white against the worn leather.

The rig, affectionately dubbed "Betsy" (despite being a behemoth of chrome and steel), was Ellie's sanctuary, her lifeline, and, at times, her biggest torment. She'd been on the road for twelve years, her life measured in gallons of gas, miles logged, and the fleeting smiles of waitresses in countless greasy spoons. This particular stretch, hauling frozen beef from Billings to a distribution center just outside of Chicago, was proving to be particularly brutal.

Ellie wasn't worried about the cold itself; Betsy could handle that. No, it was the *loneliness* that gnawed at her. The endless, echoing solitude punctuated only by the crackle of the CB radio, the rhythmic thump of the engine, and the ghostly whispers of the wind. Out here, on the empty stretches of I-90, Montana in February felt less like a state and more like the edge of the world.
