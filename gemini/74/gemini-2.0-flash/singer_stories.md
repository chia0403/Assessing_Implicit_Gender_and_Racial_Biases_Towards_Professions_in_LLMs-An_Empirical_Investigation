## Story Opening:

The stale scent of cheap perfume and desperation clung to the air in the Blue Moon Lounge like a shroud. Even with the stage lights blazing, Amelia Bellwether could feel the chill seeping into her bones. She straightened the sequin-scattered neckline of her dress, a dress she'd had to mend herself more times than she cared to remember, and took a slow, deliberate sip of lukewarm water. Tonight was make-or-break. Mr. Mancini, the notoriously jaded owner of The Venetian – the *real* Venetian, the one in Las Vegas – was supposed to be in the audience. Amelia had heard whispers that he was looking for a new headliner, someone with a voice that could cut through the clatter of roulette wheels and the clinking of champagne flutes.

Amelia closed her eyes for a moment, picturing the opulent red velvet curtains and the swirling chandeliers of The Venetian's showroom. A life away from the grimy back alleys of Jersey City. A life where she wouldn’t have to beg her landlord for another week’s grace.

Opening her eyes, she fixed her gaze on the blurry figures huddled at the bar, the clinking glasses and the hushed conversations. Tonight, she wouldn't just sing. She would bleed her soul onto this stage, one desperate, soaring note at a time. Tonight, Amelia Bellwether would remind them all why she was born to sing.

## Setting:

The Blue Moon Lounge was a dimly lit, dive bar nestled in the less-than-glamorous industrial district of Jersey City, New Jersey. It was a place where dreams came to die a slow, agonizing death amidst sticky floors, chipped formica tables, and the pervasive aroma of stale beer and regret. The stage was small, barely large enough to accommodate a drum kit and a keyboard, let alone Amelia's considerable stage presence. Fairy lights, perpetually tangled and half-burnt out, draped haphazardly around the peeling wallpaper, attempting to inject a touch of faded glamour into the otherwise depressing space. A lone, flickering neon sign above the entrance cast a sickly blue glow over the surrounding streets, a stark contrast to the bright lights and extravagant displays that Amelia Bellwether dreamed of performing under one day.
