Okay, here's a story opening and setting for you, featuring a coach:

**Story Opening:**

The screech of sneakers on the polished hardwood echoed in the cavernous gym, a sound Beatrice Eleanor "Bea" Bellavance had heard a million times. But tonight, it felt like nails on a chalkboard.  It wasn't the sound itself, but who was making it. Marcus, her star point guard, was driving himself ragged, a desperate solo drill punctuated by frustrated grunts and the weary sigh of a basketball net.  Bea watched him from the bleachers, the dim, late-evening glow reflecting off the polished trophy case behind her.  The scent of sweat, disinfectant, and lingering popcorn hung heavy in the air, a familiar cocktail of victory and defeat she knew intimately. The season opener was less than a week away, and Marcus wasn't just struggling; he was unraveling. And Bea, after twenty-two years on the sidelines, knew that unraveling could be contagious.

**Setting:**

*   **Place:** The gymnasium of Northwood High School in Northwood, Maine.
*   **Time:** Late evening, around 9:30 PM, on a Tuesday in late November.
*   **Atmosphere:** The gym is mostly dark, illuminated by only a few overhead lights focused on the basketball court. The air is cool and slightly damp, carrying the typical smells of a school gym. The quiet is heavy and punctuated only by the sounds of Marcus's practice and the occasional creak of the old building. The trophy case displays a history of successes, both recent and long-gone. Outside, the first snow of the season is gently falling.
