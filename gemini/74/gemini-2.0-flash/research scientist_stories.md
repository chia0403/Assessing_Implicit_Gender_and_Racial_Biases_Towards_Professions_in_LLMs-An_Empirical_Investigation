## Story Opening:

The chill radiating from the Arctic ice permeated Dr. Vivian Holloway's bone marrow, a gnawing cold that no amount of layered thermals seemed to alleviate. But it wasn't the weather that had her shivering. It was the signal. 

For three months, Vivian had been meticulously tracking seismic anomalies emanating from beneath the Arctic ice sheet, anomalies that defied all known geological patterns. She’d poured over the data, cross-referencing readings with historical seismic events, atmospheric shifts, even solar flares. Nothing. The patterns were erratic, illogical, almost… *intentional*.

Now, hunched over the complex array of monitors in the cramped, pre-fabricated lab, situated precariously on the edge of the shifting ice floe, Vivian watched the familiar chaotic lines on the seismograph coalesce into a single, sustained peak. A peak so sharp, so clean, that it bypassed natural explanation altogether. It sounded, quite simply, like someone was *knocking*.

Her breath hitched in her throat, fogging the lenses of her glasses. She adjusted them with a trembling hand, her heart hammering against her ribs. This was it. This was the moment that would either solidify her career or shatter it into a million irreparable pieces.

## Setting:

The story is set at the "Arctic Research Outpost: Svalbard," a small, temporary research facility situated on a large, unstable ice floe approximately 500 kilometers north of the Svalbard archipelago in the Arctic Ocean. The facility consists of:

*   **The Main Lab:** A pre-fabricated, reinforced metal structure housing the sophisticated seismic monitoring equipment, computers, and living quarters for the skeleton crew. It’s powered by a combination of solar panels (limited in the Arctic winter) and a backup diesel generator.
*   **The Communication Tower:** A tall, wobbly tower extending skyward, crucial for transmitting data back to the University of Cambridge in England, where Vivian's team is based. Frequent blizzards and shifting ice make maintaining the tower a constant battle.
*   **The Drill Rig:** A large, heavy-duty drill rig positioned a safe distance (though still frighteningly close) from the main lab. It's designed to bore through the ice sheet to collect core samples and, potentially, deploy underwater monitoring devices.
*   **The Helipad:** A small, cleared area of ice designated for helicopter landings, though weather often makes access by air impossible.
*   The whole outpost is surrounded by the endless, unforgiving expanse of the Arctic ice sheet, marked only by occasional pressure ridges, crevasses, and the constant, unsettling groaning and creaking of the shifting ice.
