## Story Opening & Setting:

**Opening:**

The ringing of the landline sliced through the comfortable silence of Eleanor Penelope Ainsworth’s small, cluttered office like a blunt butter knife through cold butter. She sighed, pushing aside a stack of brochures showcasing the azure waters of the Maldives and reaching for the receiver. "Ainsworth's Away," she chirped, injecting a level of enthusiasm she certainly didn't feel.

"Ellie? It's Beatrice. Beatrice Weatherly."

Eleanor's stomach sank. Beatrice Weatherly was not a good sign. Beatrice was a walking, talking compendium of worst-case travel scenarios. Lost luggage? Beatrice. Food poisoning? Beatrice. Volcanic ash cloud grounding all flights? You guessed it. Beatrice.

"Beatrice," Eleanor replied, her voice a carefully neutral tone. "What can I do for you today?" She braced herself for the inevitable deluge of complaints, cancellations, and catastrophic travel woes.

"Oh, Ellie," Beatrice wailed, "This is simply dreadful. Absolutely dreadful!"

**Setting:**

Ainsworth's Away, tucked away on a quiet side street in the quaint seaside town of Seabrook, Maine, wasn't exactly a thriving hub of exotic adventure. The office itself was a testament to Eleanor's personal style: a delightful blend of organized chaos and nostalgic charm. Vintage travel posters adorned the walls, showcasing destinations from a bygone era – steamships cutting through sapphire seas, sun-kissed beaches populated by fashionable sunbathers in their Sunday best, and majestic mountain peaks that promised adventure.

Eleanor's desk was a sea of paperwork, interspersed with miniature globes, souvenir trinkets from her own (far too infrequent) travels, and a perpetually half-empty mug of lukewarm Earl Grey tea. Sunlight streamed through the large bay window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and highlighting the worn edges of the well-loved travel guides that lined the shelves. It was a cozy, comforting space, the sort of place where one could easily lose themselves in the promise of faraway lands, even if, like Eleanor, they rarely got to experience them themselves.
