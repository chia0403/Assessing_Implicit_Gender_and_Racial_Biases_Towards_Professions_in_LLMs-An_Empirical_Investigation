## Story Opening:

The air hung thick with the smell of burnt popcorn and nervous sweat. Inside Studio B at Culver Studios, the temperature was hovering somewhere between "sauna" and "inferno," and the only sound louder than the buzzing of the ancient fluorescent lights was the rhythmic, frustrated sigh of Alistair Rhys Fairbanks.

He ran a hand through his already dishevelled silver hair, the movement exposing the stark white roots that screamed of a life spent under pressure and studio lighting. Alistair, a man who had once commanded entire armies of extras and directed the soaring imaginations of Hollywood's elite, was currently locked in a battle of wills with a rogue disco ball.

It refused, stubbornly, to spin.

He’d tried everything. He’d pleaded with the gaffer, threatened the production assistant, and even, in a moment of uncharacteristic desperation, bribed the studio electrician with a vintage bottle of Scotch. Nothing worked. The goddamn disco ball remained as still and unreflective as a grumpy old man refusing to dance.

Alistair Rhys Fairbanks, once hailed as the “Maestro of Mayhem” and the “Lord of Lightness” for his distinct blend of action and whimsical comedy, was now, at sixty-two years old, feeling more like the “Master of Misery.” He was three weeks into shooting "Stardust Serenade," a musical sci-fi romance that everyone, including his own goddamn therapist, had warned him was a recipe for disaster.

And right now, staring at the lifeless, mirrored sphere hanging precariously above his leading lady, he was starting to believe they were right.

## Setting:

**Culver Studios, Culver City, California. Specifically, Studio B, a soundstage that had seen better days. The studio is cavernous, filled with the detritus of film production: scattered cables snaking across the floor, half-empty coffee cups perched precariously on equipment cases, and the lingering aroma of industrial cleaning supplies struggling to mask the aforementioned popcorn and sweat. The walls are painted a dull grey, punctuated by faded notices warning against fire hazards and union regulations. The set itself is a stylized, futuristic nightclub, complete with neon accents, geometric furniture, and a raised platform for musical performances. However, the overall effect is more "budget-friendly sci-fi convention" than "glamorous intergalactic discotheque."**
