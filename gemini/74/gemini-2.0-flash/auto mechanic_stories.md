## Story Opening:

The acrid smell of burnt rubber and disappointment clung to Leo Maxwell like motor oil to his skin. He wiped a greasy hand across his forehead, leaving a black streak that mirrored the lines etched deeper into his face these past few months. The damn engine still coughed and sputtered, a mechanical death rattle that mocked his expertise. Leo slammed the wrench down on the workbench, the clatter echoing in the cavernous bay of Maxwell's Garage. "Damn it all!" he roared, the frustration finally bubbling over. He’d been staring at this vintage Mustang's engine for three days straight, and the damn thing was proving as stubborn as his late father had been about quitting smoking. He knew, deep down, what the problem was, but he just couldn't bring himself to face it. It was like admitting defeat, a bitter pill for a man who prided himself on fixing anything with an engine.

## Setting:

Maxwell's Garage was a monument to the past, a greasy, oil-stained time capsule nestled on the outskirts of the sleepy town of Havenwood, Ohio. Sunlight struggled to penetrate the grime-covered windows, casting long, dusty rays across the concrete floor. Tools hung meticulously (though somewhat rustily) from the pegboard walls, each with its own designated spot, a testament to Leo's father's obsession with order. Posters of classic cars adorned the walls, faded and peeling at the edges, showcasing vehicles Leo had only ever dreamed of owning. The air hung heavy with the scent of oil, gasoline, and the faint, sweet aroma of Leo’s perpetually brewing coffee in the back office. The main bay held three lifts, one currently occupied by the infuriating Mustang, another hoisting a beat-up Ford pickup truck, and the third sitting empty, gathering dust. Outside, a gravel lot held a graveyard of forgotten vehicles, rusted hulks slowly succumbing to the elements, each with its own story, each a piece of Havenwood's history. The garage itself had been in the Maxwell family for three generations, and it was as much a part of Leo as his own name. It was his livelihood, his legacy, and right now, it felt like his curse.
