## Story Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

The flickering fluorescent lights of Maplewood Elementary buzzed like trapped bees, a relentless soundtrack to Dr. Amelia Rose Finch's Tuesday morning migraine. She pinched the bridge of her nose, willing the throbbing behind her eyes to subside. Ten minutes. Ten minutes until her first appointment: a seven-year-old named Leo with a penchant for biting and a mother who swore he was simply "misunderstood." Amelia sighed. Misunderstood, perhaps. But also sporting a set of incisors sharp enough to make a small rodent jealous.

**Setting:**

Maplewood Elementary School was a sprawling, single-story brick building, the kind that exuded a comforting (though slightly depressing) familiarity. Located in the quiet, tree-lined suburb of Oakhaven, nestled between a sprawling park and a bustling shopping center, it served a diverse population of students from varying socioeconomic backgrounds.

Amelia's office, tucked away in a quiet corner near the library, was a sanctuary of sorts. She'd tried to soften the institutional feel with a brightly colored rug, a few strategically placed plants (most of which were slowly succumbing to neglect), and a collection of children's artwork she'd accumulated over the years. A worn, comfortable armchair sat invitingly near a small table filled with crayons, coloring books, and a box of puppets. Despite her best efforts, however, the faint smell of disinfectant and the lingering echoes of children's laughter still permeated the space, a constant reminder of the challenges and rewards that came with being a school psychologist in a place where childhood anxieties were as common as playground scrapes.
