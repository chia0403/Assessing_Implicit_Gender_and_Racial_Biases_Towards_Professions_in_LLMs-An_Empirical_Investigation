The biting wind, laced with the scent of pine and the distant roar of the ocean, hammered against the workshop windows, mimicking the frantic rhythm of Theodore "Theo" Bartholomew’s hammer. He squinted, pushing a stray lock of graying hair from his brow. The light was fading fast, bleeding out from the late afternoon sky over the rugged coast of Maine.

Theo’s workshop, a ramshackle building perched precariously on the edge of a rocky cliff overlooking the churning Atlantic, was a testament to his life. Sawdust coated every surface, clinging to the aged timbers and the worn leather of his apron. The walls were plastered with half-finished sketches of boats, houses, and intricate wood carvings, a visual record of his past commissions and his simmering ambitions. The air, thick with the aroma of sawdust, linseed oil, and the faintest whiff of salt spray, was a comforting balm to his weary soul. Tools hung neatly on pegboards, a symphony of polished steel and well-worn handles, each one holding a story of its own.

Outside, the world was a canvas of grey and green, the relentless waves crashing against the jagged rocks below, a constant reminder of the power and indifference of nature. Inside, amidst the controlled chaos, Theodore Bartholomew, craftsman and dreamer, wrestled with a particularly stubborn piece of oak, trying to coax its stubborn grain into the graceful curve of a swan's neck.
