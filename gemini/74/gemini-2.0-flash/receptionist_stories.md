The fluorescent lights of the firm, "Bryant & Sterling, Attorneys at Law," buzzed with a relentless, low hum that perfectly mirrored Eleanor Beatrice Ainsworth's mounting boredom. It was 2:47 PM on a Tuesday, and the only excitement Eleanor had experienced so far was deciphering whether Mr. Peterson, the firm's senior partner, had actually smiled at her when she'd brought him his lukewarm Earl Grey this morning. Highly unlikely.

Eleanor sighed, adjusting the crisp white collar of her blouse. The reception area was meticulously designed to project an image of unwavering competence and sophisticated success. Gleaming mahogany desks, a strategically placed abstract sculpture that probably cost more than her car, and framed diplomas from prestigious law schools lined the walls. It was all incredibly impressive, and incredibly soul-crushing to be stuck in, day in and day out.

She looked out the large glass doors, observing the muted grey cityscape of downtown Chicago. Rain threatened, a dark smudge hanging low in the distance. It was the kind of day where you wanted to curl up with a good book and a steaming mug of cocoa, not direct confused clients to the correct conference room and politely deflect calls from persistent salespeople.
