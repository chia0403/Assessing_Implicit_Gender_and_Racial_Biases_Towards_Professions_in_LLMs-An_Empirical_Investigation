The harsh fluorescent lights of the Piggly Wiggly hummed a discordant symphony above Beatrice Eleanor Cartwright's head, a tune she’d grown intimately familiar with over the past five years. The bell above the automatic doors dinged a shrill greeting, momentarily breaking the monotony, but Beatrice didn't bother looking up. She knew the sound as well as she knew the price of a loaf of Wonder Bread (currently $2.89, up from $2.50 last month, thanks inflation).

Beatrice was the kind of cashier who knew your dog's name if you shopped regularly, and probably remembered your grocery list better than you did yourself. But today, even her usual sunny disposition felt dimmed by the relentless South Carolina heat simmering just beyond the automatic doors. It was mid-July in Magnolia Springs, a town steeped in the thick, sweet air of honeysuckle and generations of family secrets. The kind of town where everyone knew everyone else’s business, and the most exciting event of the week was Mrs. Henderson’s annual watermelon carving contest. And Beatrice, stuck behind register three, felt like she was slowly melting into the linoleum floor, another forgotten detail in the tapestry of small-town life.
