The diesel thrummed through Albert "Albie" Kowalski's bones, a vibration he'd come to crave like coffee in the morning. He shifted the D10's massive gears, the sound a familiar, satisfying groan that echoed across the desolate landscape. Dust devils danced in the shimmering heat, swirling orange motes against the bruised purple of the Arizona sky. Albie squinted, pushing the brim of his faded John Deere cap lower over his eyes. He was baking, sweating, and coated in a fine layer of ochre grit, but for the first time in weeks, he wasn't resenting the job.

He was in the middle of nowhere, true. *Really* the middle of nowhere. The job site, a future solar farm sprawling across a dried-up lakebed near Hope, Arizona, was a brutal canvas of cracked earth, scrub brush, and endless horizon. Cell service was spotty at best, and the nearest town, a collection of dusty storefronts and sun-bleached trailers, offered little in the way of entertainment besides lukewarm beer and even warmer gossip. But today, the isolation feltâ€¦ peaceful.

Albie was leveling the ground, preparing it for the miles of steel and silicon that would eventually convert sunlight into electricity. The work was monotonous, repetitive, a steady push and pull, a smoothing of the earth's wrinkles. But in each pass, in each meticulously graded section, Albie found a quiet satisfaction. He wasn't just pushing dirt; he was building something. And after everything that had happened back in Phoenix, building something felt like the closest thing to rebuilding himself.
