## Story Opening:

The rasp of steel against granite was a familiar lullaby to Theron Aurelius Stone, a sound that vibrated in his bones and echoed in the cramped, damp workshop he called home. He squinted, pushing a stray lock of grey-streaked brown hair from his brow, as another sliver of stone flaked away, revealing the smooth curve beneath. The chill October wind howled outside, rattling the makeshift wooden door, but Theron was lost in the world within the stone, a world he was painstakingly coaxing into existence. Today, it was the wing of an angel, destined for the tomb of a wealthy merchantâ€™s late wife. He ran a calloused thumb over the emerging feather, his lips pursed in concentration. A whisper of snow had begun to fall outside, coating the nearby gravestones like a shroud. He hoped he could finish the wing before dusk, the light was already fading fast.

## Setting:

Theron's workshop was carved directly into the side of a low, rocky hill on the outskirts of the village of Harrow's Glen. The village itself nestled in a valley carved by the rushing River Swift, known for its unpredictable floods and the stubborn independence of its inhabitants. The surrounding hills were a tapestry of slate-grey stone, dotted with hardy pines and windswept heather. The workshop was more cave than building, its entrance a rough-hewn archway protected by a rickety wooden door. Inside, the air was thick with the dust of pulverized stone, illuminated by the flickering light of a single tallow candle and the meager rays that filtered through a small, unglazed window overlooking the graveyard. Tools of all sizes, honed and worn smooth by years of use, lay scattered across a rough wooden workbench. Half-finished statues, discarded fragments, and stacks of granite blocks cluttered the space, each piece a testament to Theron's skill and the harsh beauty of the land. The graveyard, a somber vista of weathered headstones and creeping ivy, stretched out below the workshop, a constant reminder of the inevitability Theron's craft sought to soften.
