The clatter of tiny plastic forks scraping against even tinier paper plates was a symphony to Ms. Eleanor Beatrice Ainsworth, albeit a slightly grating one after three hours. She leaned back in her miniature, ladybug-adorned chair, the spring threatening to give out beneath her, and surveyed her domain. 

The setting: Mrs. Ainsworth's third-grade classroom, Room 12, at Meadow Creek Elementary. It was a haven of brightly colored construction paper, alphabet charts, and enough glitter to rival a fairy's wardrobe. Sunlight streamed through the large, picture-book-laden windows, illuminating the dust motes dancing in the air and the sticky fingerprints adorning the glass. On the back wall, a mural depicting the life cycle of a butterfly, meticulously painted by the class earlier in the semester, served as a testament to their (mostly) cooperative spirit. Currently, however, it served as a backdrop to a chaotic lunch scene: half-eaten peanut butter sandwiches, discarded apple cores, and the enthusiastic chatter of twenty-two eight-year-olds fueled by sugar and boundless energy.
