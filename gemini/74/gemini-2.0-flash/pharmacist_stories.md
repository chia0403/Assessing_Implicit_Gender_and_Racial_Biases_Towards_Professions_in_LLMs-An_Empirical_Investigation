## Story Opening:

The bell above the door jingled a discordant tune, barely audible above the hum of the refrigeration unit keeping the vaccines at precisely 36 degrees Fahrenheit. Amelia Grace Hawthorne, owner and sole pharmacist of Hawthorne’s Apothecary, didn't even look up. She was wrestling with a stubborn childproof cap on a bottle of amoxicillin, her brow furrowed in concentration. She knew, without seeing, it was probably Mrs. Higgins again, back for more cough syrup.

Finally, with a frustrated grunt, the cap relented. Amelia smoothed the crinkled label and set the bottle aside. “Just a moment,” she called out, her voice warm and practiced, even before she looked up to greet her customer. But it wasn’t Mrs. Higgins.

Standing in the doorway was a man Amelia had never seen before. He was tall, impossibly so, and wore a dark, well-worn leather jacket despite the early summer heat. His face was etched with lines that suggested more experience than his apparent age, and his eyes – a startling shade of glacial blue – scanned the aisles of the pharmacy with an intensity that made Amelia uneasy. He exuded a quiet, controlled energy that prickled the hairs on the back of her neck.

"Ms. Hawthorne?" he asked, his voice a low rumble.

## Setting:

Hawthorne’s Apothecary was a fixture in the small, sleepy town of Havenwood, nestled in the rolling hills of western Massachusetts. It was more than just a pharmacy; it was a community hub. The building itself was old, built in the late 1800s with ornate brickwork and large, inviting windows. Inside, polished hardwood floors creaked beneath the weight of history.

Aisles were packed with a chaotic, yet comforting, mix of necessities and nostalgia. Rows of brightly colored cough drops sat next to hand-crafted soaps. Locally-made honey lined up with antiseptic wipes. Jars of hard candies winked from the countertop, a treat Amelia offered every child who came in. Behind the long, oak counter, shelves were stacked high with boxes of medication, meticulously organized by Amelia according to their generic names and dosages.

The air always smelled of a peculiar blend: antiseptic, licorice, and the faint, comforting aroma of chamomile tea, which Amelia brewed every afternoon for herself and any customers who wanted a cup. The walls were adorned with framed photographs of Havenwood in its heyday, a time when the town thrived on its lumber industry. Now, Havenwood was mostly known for its antique shops and its quiet, unassuming charm – a place where everyone knew everyone, and nothing much ever happened. Or at least, it used to be.
