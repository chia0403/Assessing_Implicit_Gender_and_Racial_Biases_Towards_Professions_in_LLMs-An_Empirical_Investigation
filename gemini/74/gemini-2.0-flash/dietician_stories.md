Okay, here's a story opening with setting and our main character, a dietician:

**Story Opening:**

The aroma of burnt sugar clung to the air, a bitter betrayal of Amelia Claire Harrington's senses. She wrinkled her nose, pushing open the heavy oak door to "The Sweet Surrender" bakery. It was, as always, a sensory assault – a kaleidoscope of pastel icing, a cacophony of clattering pans and boisterous chatter, and a saccharine sweetness that practically glued her nostrils shut. Amelia knew, with a certainty that resonated deep in her weary bones, that the culprit behind the burnt sugar was Old Man Fitzwilliam, the bakery’s owner and her patient, attempting his famous caramel swirl cookies again. His recent attempts had been, to put it mildly, catastrophic.

**Setting:**

The story is set in Havenwood, a picturesque New England town nestled amongst rolling hills and vibrant autumn foliage. Havenwood is known for its quaint charm, antique shops, and, perhaps most famously, "The Sweet Surrender" bakery, a local institution famous for its decadent pastries and comforting treats. While seemingly idyllic, Havenwood also struggles with the same health issues as any other community, albeit hidden behind a facade of cozy contentment and afternoon tea. Amelia's office, "Harrington Nutrition," is located just across the town square from the bakery, a deliberate and often frustrating juxtaposition. Her office is a serene oasis of calm, filled with natural light, leafy plants, and evidence-based resources on nutrition and wellness, a stark contrast to the sugary temptations just a stone's throw away.
