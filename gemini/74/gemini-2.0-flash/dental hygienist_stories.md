## The Story Opening:

The chipped porcelain of the mermaid toothbrush holder caught the early morning light streaming through the bay window of her apartment. Genevieve Marie Dubois sighed, tracing a lazy finger over the mermaid’s peeling paint. 6:15 AM. Not nearly early enough to feel rested, but too early to justify hitting snooze again. Another day, another thirty sets of teeth. Some sparkling, some stained, some so riddled with decay they made her stomach churn. 

Genevieve hated the churn. She'd become a dental hygienist to *help* people, to prevent the gnashing agony she remembered from childhood, not to constantly confront the neglect and sugary self-destruction that seemed to plague half the city of Portland. Still, she pulled herself upright, the weight of her cotton scrubs a comforting presence even before she’d put them on. Today was a new day, and maybe, just maybe, she could convince Mrs. Abernathy to switch to an electric toothbrush. Baby steps, Genevieve reminded herself. Baby steps towards a healthier, happier mouth.

## The Setting:

**Genevieve's Apartment:** A small, one-bedroom apartment in the vibrant but slightly gritty neighborhood of Southeast Portland. Think exposed brick, mismatched furniture salvaged from vintage shops, and an abundance of houseplants struggling to survive on neglect and the occasional misting. The overall aesthetic is "eclectic bohemian," bordering on cluttered, reflecting Genevieve's own tendency towards creative pursuits and a general aversion to strict organization. Bookshelves overflow with everything from dental hygiene textbooks to dog-eared copies of classic novels. Art, mostly watercolors and charcoal sketches created by Genevieve herself, adorns the walls. The kitchen is tiny, but boasts a well-stocked coffee station, a testament to her caffeine dependency.

**Dr. Thompson's Family Dentistry (where Genevieve works):** A warm and inviting dental practice located just across the river in the Hawthorne district. Dr. Thompson, a kind but slightly scatterbrained dentist in his late 50s, has cultivated a comfortable, family-oriented atmosphere. The waiting room is painted in soothing pastel colors, equipped with comfortable armchairs, and littered with magazines featuring healthy living and travel destinations. The air is perpetually scented with the faint, antiseptic smell of disinfectant, mingled with the sweet aroma of cinnamon-flavored toothpaste. While not cutting-edge, Dr. Thompson's practice is well-equipped and focuses on providing quality, personalized care to its patients.
