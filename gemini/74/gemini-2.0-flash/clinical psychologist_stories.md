## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** A relentless, salt-laced wind whipped off the Puget Sound, rattling the windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office in the quaint seaside town of Port Townsend, Washington. The late afternoon sun, usually a golden gift to the Olympic Peninsula, struggled to pierce through the bruised-purple clouds gathering ominously over the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Eleanor's office, nestled on the second floor of a Victorian-era building painted a cheerful, if slightly faded, periwinkle blue, was typically a sanctuary of calm, filled with the scent of lavender and the low murmur of the nearby waves. Today, however, even the meticulously arranged collection of seashells on her windowsill seemed to tremble with a restless energy.

**Story Opening:**

Dr. Eleanor Vance stared at the flickering flame of the aromatherapy candle on her desk, the scent of sandalwood doing little to soothe the unsettling prickle at the back of her neck. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her. It wasn't just the weather, though the Pacific Northwest had a knack for amplifying one's inner anxieties. It was the voicemail.

She'd played it back for the fifth time in the last hour. The voice, raspy and low, had sent a chill down her spine that lingered long after the recording had ended.

"Dr. Vance," the voice had whispered, laced with a chilling familiarity, "You think you can help people, but you haven't even begun to understand the darkness that exists. You think you know fear? Just wait. It's coming for you, too."

Eleanor pushed back from her mahogany desk, the aged wood creaking in protest. A wave of nausea washed over her. Who was this? And how did they know about her... about her own buried fears? She had prided herself on her ability to compartmentalize, to separate her professional life from the ghosts of her past. But this felt different, more personal, more sinister. This felt like a deliberate intrusion, a carefully calculated threat.

She reached for the worn, leather-bound journal that lay on the corner of her desk. It was a habit, a ritual. A place to unpack the day's burdens, the silent stories she carried for others. Tonight, however, she suspected she'd be writing not about her patients, but about the shadow that had just fallen across her own door. The shadow that smelled of salt, fear, and something else entirely... something undeniably, disturbingly familiar.
