Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a probation officer as the main character:

**Setting:** The cramped, fluorescent-lit office of the "Western Metro Probation Services" in a struggling industrial suburb of Detroit, Michigan. The building is a squat, brick structure that clearly used to be something else – perhaps a bank or a small factory. The air inside smells faintly of old coffee, disinfectant, and the lingering anxiety of countless parolees.  Rows of battered desks are separated by flimsy particleboard dividers. Outside, the November wind howls off the Great Lakes, rattling the ill-fitting windows.

**Opening:**

The stack of files on Delilah Marie Rodriguez’s desk threatened to topple over with the next tremor caused by a passing truck. Delilah, however, was more concerned with the icy dread creeping up her spine than the precarious paperwork. She'd been staring at the same parolee report for the last fifteen minutes, its typewritten words blurring into a meaningless jumble.  *Christopher Bellisari. Armed robbery. History of substance abuse.* The usual cocktail of misfortune and bad choices. But something about the report felt…off. Not technically incorrect, just…wrong.

She pushed her glasses further up her nose and tapped a fingernail, chipped and ragged, against the cover sheet. Bellisari was supposed to check in this morning. It was now 3:17 PM. No call, no show.  Standard procedure was a verbal warning, then escalating measures. But with Bellisari, a gut feeling - one honed over seven years of navigating the tangled lives of Detroit’s released offenders - screamed at her to skip the niceties. She’d seen this quiet, simmering danger before, the kind that exploded without warning.

Delilah sighed, the sound lost in the drone of a malfunctioning fluorescent bulb above her head.  Time to make a house call.
