## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The year is 1888. The air in Whitechapel, London hangs thick with coal smoke, river stink, and the ever-present miasma of poverty. Gas lamps cast flickering, anemic pools of light on cobbled streets slick with rain. A cacophony of hawkers' cries, rattling carts, and the ragged coughs of the consumptive fills the narrow alleyways.

**Story Opening:**

"Another day, another carcass," grumbled Bartholomew "Barty" Higgins, his breath fogging in the pre-dawn chill. He wrestled the heavy hindquarter of beef onto the worn butcher block, the thud echoing in the otherwise silent Higgins & Sons Butchers, a fixture on Dorset Street for over seventy years. Barty’s hands, gnarled and reddened from years of cold water and the relentless cleaving of bone and sinew, moved with a practiced familiarity. He ran a steel along the edge of his favourite bone saw, the rasping sound a comforting counterpoint to the unsettling silence of the streets outside.

The air inside the shop was thick with the metallic tang of blood and the rich, savory aroma of smoked meats. String after string of sausages hung from the rafters, glistening under the weak gaslight. Rows of meticulously arranged cuts of mutton and pork lined the ice-filled display case, a testament to Barty’s dedication, even on mornings when the city felt particularly rotten.

He paused, wiping his brow with the back of a bloodstained apron. Outside, a dog howled, a long, mournful sound that made the hairs on Barty's neck prickle. He knew that sound. It was the sound of unrest, the sound of the streets whispering secrets best left unheard. And lately, the secrets of Whitechapel were getting louder, uglier, and a whole lot closer to home.
