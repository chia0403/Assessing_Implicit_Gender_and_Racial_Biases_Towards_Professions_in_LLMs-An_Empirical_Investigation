The biting wind whipped snowflakes against the clinic window, blurring the neon green paw print that hung crookedly above the entrance. Inside, the air was thick with the comforting aroma of disinfectant, wood shavings, and the slightly less comforting scent of wet dog. Dr. Eleanor Beatrice Ainsworth, DVM, scrubbed her hands raw at the stainless-steel sink, the harsh antibacterial soap doing little to thaw her frozen fingers.

The setting was Havenwood, Vermont, a town seemingly plucked from the pages of a Currier and Ives print, if Currier and Ives had a penchant for stray cats and stubborn cows. Havenwood Veterinary Clinic was the only animal medical facility for miles, a converted farmhouse that had seen better days. Eleanor had inherited it from her grandfather, a gruff, old-school veterinarian who believed in leeches and the healing power of raw honey. Sheâ€™d modernized it, of course, adding X-ray machines and computerized records, but the spirit of the place remained stubbornly, charmingly rustic. The waiting room was filled with faded floral cushions, dog-eared copies of "National Geographic," and a constant low hum of anxiety emanating from the various furry, feathered, and scaled patients (and their equally anxious owners).
