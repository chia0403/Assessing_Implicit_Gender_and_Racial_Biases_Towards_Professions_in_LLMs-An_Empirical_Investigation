The bite of the November wind chewed through the worn fabric of Leo Maxwell's Carhartt jacket as he surveyed the skeletal frame of the skyscraper reaching towards the slate-grey sky. Downtown Chicago, usually a vibrant tapestry of noise and light, felt muted, almost melancholic, on this pre-dawn morning. Streetlights cast long, anemic shadows, painting the wet asphalt with streaks of amber and gloom. He pulled his wool cap further down over his ears, his breath puffing out in a small white cloud. This was going to be another long, cold day. The steel groaned under the pressure of the wind, a mournful song that resonated with the dull ache in his knees. This site, the future home of "The Aurora Tower," promised luxury condos and panoramic views for the city's elite. Leo, however, saw only beams, rivets, and the relentless grind of manual labor that paid the bills and kept a roof over his head. He spat a stream of coffee-colored saliva onto the muddy ground and adjusted his hard hat. Time to climb.
