## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights hummed a dissonant symphony above Clara Beatrice Peterson’s head, a familiar tune that both comforted and grated on her nerves. She tightened the tourniquet around Mrs. Higgins’ arm, the wrinkled skin puckering under the pressure. “Alright, just a little pinch now, dear,” she said, her voice a practiced blend of soothing and professional. She carefully palpated for a vein, her fingertips ghosting over the topography of Mrs. Higgins’ forearm. Today was a difficult day; the hospital was packed, understaffed, and the air hung heavy with the unspoken anxieties of impending winter. It was the kind of day that made Clara question if she should have stuck with her pottery hobby and opened that little shop she’d always dreamed of. But then, Mrs. Higgins gave a small smile, a flash of gold tooth glinting in the light, and said, “You’ve always been so gentle, Clara. I trust you completely.” And in that moment, the hum of the lights faded, replaced by the quiet satisfaction of knowing she made a difference, one vein at a time.

## Setting:

**St. Jude’s Mercy Hospital, Providence, Rhode Island. November, 2023.** The hospital, a sprawling complex of red brick and steel, stood a few blocks from the Providence River. The interior was a maze of corridors, smelling faintly of antiseptic and stale coffee. Clara worked primarily on the fourth floor, in the outpatient phlebotomy lab. The lab itself was a small, brightly lit room, crammed with equipment: blood-drawing chairs, centrifuge machines humming in the corner, a stainless-steel counter covered in vials and needles, and a perpetually overflowing sharps container. Outside the lab, the hallway was a constant stream of patients, doctors, nurses, and visitors, all navigating the labyrinthine paths of St. Jude’s. The large windows offered a view of the grey, autumnal Rhode Island landscape, a stark contrast to the controlled environment within the hospital walls.
