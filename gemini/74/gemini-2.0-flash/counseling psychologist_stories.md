Okay, here's a story opening with a counseling psychologist as the main character, including a setting:

**Story Opening:**

The scent of burnt cinnamon and desperation hung heavy in the air of Dr. Anya Sharma's office. Not the literal smell of burnt cinnamon, thankfully. Though, Anya often joked with herself that maybe a diffuser emitting that particular aroma would be less offensive than the existential dread that frequently seeped from her clients' pores. Today, though, the smell was particularly pungent, a sharp, metallic tang mixing with the usual undertones of stale coffee and floral air freshener. It was Tuesday, and Tuesdays, Anya had learned, were prime days for emotional breakdowns.

Outside, the November wind howled a mournful tune around the old Victorian house that housed her practice, "The Willow Tree Counseling Center." The building itself was a comforting anomaly amidst the glass and steel skyscrapers that dominated downtown Seattle. Its peeling paint, overgrown ivy, and slightly crooked porch gave it a character that screamed "safe haven" to those who needed it most.

Anya took a slow sip from her lukewarm tea, the ceramic mug warming her numb fingers. She glanced at the clock – 2:57 PM. Three minutes until Mr. Henderson, her afternoon’s first patient, was due. Three minutes to brace herself for whatever crisis the Seattle skyline had thrown his way. She closed her eyes, focusing on the rhythm of her breath, reminding herself to listen, truly listen, with compassion and without judgment. It was all she could ever really offer, she thought, besides a quiet, safe space to unravel. And today, it felt like that space was needed more than ever.
