## Story Opening:

The humid Florida air clung to Dr. Amelia "Amy" Hayes like a wet blanket, even inside her crisp, air-conditioned clinic. The pale blue walls of "Hayes Chiropractic Wellness" were meant to soothe, adorned with stock photos of serene landscapes and affirmations about the body's innate healing power. But on this particular Tuesday morning, the only thing soothing Amy was the lukewarm coffee she nursed between patients.

She glanced at the clock, the bright digital numbers mocking her: 9:57 AM. Mr. Henderson was late, again. And Amy knew exactly why. It wasn't the traffic on US-1. It wasn't a sudden family emergency. It was the siren song of early bird specials at the Golden Corral. Mr. Henderson, a retired longshoreman with a spine as knotted as old rigging, valued all-you-can-eat shrimp more than the relief Amy could offer.

She sighed, a sound that rippled through the quiet office and made Brenda, her ever-cheerful receptionist, glance up from her crossword puzzle. "Everything alright, Dr. Hayes?" Brenda's voice was a sugary Southern drawl, a perfect counterpoint to Amy's sharp, New York City-bred pragmatism.

Amy forced a smile. "Just anticipating the arrival of a certain culinary enthusiast." She took another swig of the coffee, its bitterness a stark contrast to the sweetness she just heard. "Brenda, maybe call Mr. Henderson and remind him gently that his lower back is not going to magically align itself over a mountain of fried chicken."

## Setting:

**Hayes Chiropractic Wellness** is located in a small strip mall on the outskirts of Boynton Beach, Florida. The strip mall is a mix of small businesses: a nail salon radiating the pungent smell of acrylic, a dry cleaner with perpetually steam-fogged windows, and a struggling cell phone repair shop. The Florida sun beats down relentlessly on the asphalt parking lot, turning it into a shimmering mirage by midday.

The clinic itself is compact but meticulously organized. The reception area is bright and welcoming, decorated with nautical-themed art â€“ a nod to the area's coastal location and the prevalence of retirees who have migrated south. Two treatment rooms, each containing a chiropractic table and various therapeutic devices, are meticulously clean and sterile. An adjoining office, overflowing with textbooks and anatomical models, serves as Amy's sanctuary. The overall impression is one of professional competence and a sincere effort to create a calming environment, a little oasis of health and wellness in the heart of suburban sprawl.
