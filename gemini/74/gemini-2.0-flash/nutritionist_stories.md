Okay, here's a story opening with a setting and the full name of our main character, a nutritionist:

**Story Opening:**

The stale scent of disinfectant and lukewarm broccoli hung heavy in the air of the break room, a scent Dr. Amelia Stone had come to associate with quiet despair. Amelia, a nutritionist with a PhD and a heart overflowing with kale-infused optimism, stared at the half-eaten plate of beige mystery meat and soggy green beans that someone – presumably a member of the esteemed surgical team – had abandoned on the communal table.

She sighed, the sound a soft puff of resignation in the otherwise silent room. Outside, the pre-dawn sky was just beginning to bleed a weak, anemic pink into the steel-grey cityscape. At 4:30 AM, even the pigeons were still asleep, a fact Amelia found herself envying more and more with each passing week. This was her life now: early mornings at St. Jude's Hospital, battling against the tide of processed foods and entrenched dietary habits, one beige mystery meat offender at a time.

**Setting:**

The primary setting is **St. Jude's Hospital in downtown Chicago**. Specifically, we are introduced to the story in the **hospital's break room**. This is a small, functional space, clearly designed for practicality rather than comfort. It features:

*   Fluorescent lighting, harsh and unflattering.
*   A worn linoleum floor in a shade that might once have been cheerful yellow, but was now closer to a sickly beige.
*   A long, scarred wooden table surrounded by mismatched plastic chairs.
*   A vending machine humming ominously in the corner, stocked with sugary drinks and processed snacks.
*   A corkboard overflowing with notices: hospital memos, flyers for yoga classes, and outdated birthday cards.
*   An overall atmosphere of weary functionality and quiet desperation.

**Main Character:**

*   **Full Name:** Dr. Amelia Stone
*   **Profession:** Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN) with a PhD in Nutritional Science.
*   **Brief Character Sketch:** Amelia is passionate about nutrition and genuinely believes in the power of food to heal and improve lives. However, she is also starting to feel the weight of the constant uphill battle against ingrained bad habits and the often-unhealthy environment of the hospital system. She is optimistic, but also realistic, and perhaps a little disillusioned.
