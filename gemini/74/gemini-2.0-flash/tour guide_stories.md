## Opening:

The air hung thick with the scent of jasmine and diesel, a peculiar blend only found in the back alleys of Old Havana. Emilia “Emmy” Rodriguez, her name embroidered in faded gold script above the pocket of her guayabera, leaned against the crumbling turquoise wall, wiping sweat from her brow with the back of her hand. The midday sun was a brutal dictator here, and Emmy, despite years of acclimatization, still felt its oppressive weight.

She checked her watch, a vintage Soviet-era model she'd inherited from her grandfather. Five minutes past the meeting time. This was Cuba Libre Tours, not Cuba Mañana Tours, dammit. While a certain laid-back attitude was part of the charm, arriving late to a tour wasn't going to charm any potential customers. Emmy sighed, a sound lost in the clatter of a passing horse-drawn carriage and the blare of Celia Cruz from a nearby open window.

"Dios mío," she muttered to herself, pushing away from the wall and adjusting her straw hat. "Let them at least be interesting tourists this time. Not another group of wide-eyed, salsa-dancing enthusiasts who think Che Guevara invented mojitos."

## Setting:

Emmy's world revolves around the crumbling beauty and vibrant chaos of Old Havana, Cuba. Her tour route, a well-worn path etched into her memory, snakes through the narrow, cobblestone streets, past baroque facades with balconies overflowing with bougainvillea, and through bustling plazas filled with the rhythmic sounds of son and the hawking cries of vendors. The air hums with a unique energy: a mix of poverty and pride, decay and dazzling colour, hardship and hope.

The buildings are a living history book, each stained wall and chipped tile whispering tales of revolution, colonialism, and resilience. Cars from the 1950s, lovingly patched and polished, rumble through the streets, a tangible link to a bygone era. The sea is ever-present, its salty breeze carrying the scent of distant shores and the promise of something more. Old Havana is a place where the past and the present collide, a place where Emmy finds both her purpose and her constant frustration. It's a place she loves fiercely, even when it tests her patience to its limits.
