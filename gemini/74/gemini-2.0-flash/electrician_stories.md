The flickering fluorescent lights of the abandoned textile mill seemed to mock Leonard "Lenny" Jakubowski's efforts. Each pulse, each brief surge of light followed by an almost immediate dimming, felt like a taunt in the echoing silence of the place. He’d been hired by some vaguely-worded property development firm to assess the building’s electrical systems, or rather, the skeletal remains of them.

Lenny, clad in his worn denim overalls and sturdy work boots, sighed, the vapor misting briefly in the chill air. The air itself was thick with the ghosts of lint and industry, a musty perfume that clung to his nostrils and prickled his skin. The mill, a monstrous brick edifice that stretched for almost a city block, had been silent for decades, since "progress" had shipped its jobs overseas. Now, the only inhabitants were pigeons, rats, and the stubborn echoes of machinery that once roared day and night.

Dust motes danced in the weak beams of his headlamp, illuminating decaying machinery, rusted pipes, and piles of discarded fabric that lay like petrified shrouds on the stained concrete floor. The main breaker panel, a hulking metal beast riddled with rust, loomed before him like a gravestone. Its wires, like exposed veins, snaked out across the floor, a tangled web of potential danger. This wasn't going to be a simple fix; this was going to be a resurrection. And Lenny, with his calloused hands, his trusty multimeter, and a healthy dose of cautious optimism, was the man tasked with bringing it back to life, one flickering fluorescent bulb at a time. He just hoped the building wasn't too far gone to save.
