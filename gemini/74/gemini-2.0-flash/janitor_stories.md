The fluorescent lights of the Finch & Sterling Insurance building hummed a monotonous tune, a tune that Bartholomew “Bart” Higgins had been hearing for the past eighteen years. It was 2:17 AM, and the sprawling, glass-and-steel behemoth was, for the most part, dormant. Outside, the city breathed a low, restless sigh, a mix of distant sirens and the rumble of late-night buses. Inside, however, Bart waged his silent war against the daily grime.

Tonight's battleground: the executive suite on the 47th floor, usually off-limits except for the witching hours. A post-holiday bonus party had left its mark – stray confetti clung stubbornly to the plush carpet, half-eaten canapés congealed in crystal bowls, and the lingering scent of expensive perfume mixed with the acrid tang of spilled champagne. Bart, armed with his trusty mop, bucket, and a slightly cynical smirk hidden beneath his bushy mustache, surveyed the scene. He imagined the titans of industry who’d celebrated here just hours before, oblivious to the silent work that kept their opulent world spinning. He was the unseen hand, the meticulous surgeon removing the evidence of their revelry. And tonight, that evidence was proving to be particularly tenacious.
