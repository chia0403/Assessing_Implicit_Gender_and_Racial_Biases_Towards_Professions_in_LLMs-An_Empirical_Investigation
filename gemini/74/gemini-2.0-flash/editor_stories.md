The humid Georgia air, thick with the scent of honeysuckle and regret, clung to Eleanor Beatrice Hawthorne as she trudged up the porch steps of the old Victorian house. Eleanor, more commonly known as Ellie Hawthorne, was a woman accustomed to the crisp, sterile environment of a Manhattan publishing house. Here, in the sleepy, almost suffocating embrace of Magnolia, Georgia, the air itself felt pregnant with unspoken stories.

The paint on the porch swing was peeling in long, languid strips, like sunburnt skin. Vines of wisteria, choked with purple blooms, clawed at the lattice, threatening to swallow the house whole. "Hawthorne House," a faded sign proclaimed beside the door, the letters half-obliterated by creeping ivy.

Ellie, senior editor at Blackwood & Sterling, had been dispatched here against her will, a casualty of a bizarre clause in a newly acquired author's contract. The author, a reclusive Southern gothic novelist named Lucinda Bellweather, had stipulated that her manuscript, "Whispers in the Cypress," be edited *on location*, at the very house where the story unfolded. Lucinda, apparently, believed the house held the key to unlocking the final, elusive magic within her words.

Ellie, who believed the key to a good manuscript was a strong cup of coffee and a rigorous application of Strunk & White, stifled a sigh. This trip, she suspected, was going to be a nightmare. She raised her hand and knocked, the sound swallowed by the oppressive silence of the late afternoon. The only answer was the rhythmic creak of the porch swing, a lonely metronome marking the slow, deliberate beat of Southern time.
