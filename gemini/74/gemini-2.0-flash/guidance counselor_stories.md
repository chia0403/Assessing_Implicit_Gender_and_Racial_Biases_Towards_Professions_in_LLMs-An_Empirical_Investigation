**Setting:** The setting is a cramped, slightly outdated guidance counselor's office at Northwood High School in the small, perpetually overcast town of Port Blossom, Washington. The walls are painted a cheerful but ultimately oppressive shade of lemon yellow, and are adorned with motivational posters that have seen better days - their corners curling and their platitudes feeling more ironic than inspiring. A worn-out, floral-patterned armchair sits opposite a large, cluttered desk, overflowing with college brochures, scholarship applications, and half-eaten granola bars. The rhythmic hum of the fluorescent lights overhead is a constant, almost unbearable companion. Outside, the gray sky presses down on the town, promising rain that never quite arrives, just a damp, clinging mist.

**Opening:**

Eleanor Marie Reynolds sighed, the sound barely audible above the hum. Another Monday. Another parade of lost souls, existential crises, and the occasional student who genuinely wanted to know the difference between an Associate's degree and a Bachelor's. She glanced at the overflowing inbox on her computer screen, a digital Mount Everest of parental emails and student appointment requests. At 42, Eleanor had envisioned herself scaling the Himalayas, not navigating the treacherous terrain of teenage angst in a town where the most exciting thing that ever happened was the annual Salmon Festival. She rubbed her tired eyes, adjusted her sensible cardigan, and plastered on the professional, empathetic smile she'd perfected over the years. The door creaked open, and a sullen-faced teenager shuffled in, reeking faintly of Axe body spray and suppressed resentment. "Eleanor," he mumbled, barely making eye contact. "I, uh, need to talk about my future... or lack thereof."
