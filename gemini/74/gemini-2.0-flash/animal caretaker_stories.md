## Story Opening and Setting

**Story Opening:**

The biting wind whipped off the icy Atlantic, stinging Margaret Eleanor Davies' cheeks as she hurried along the boardwalk. Seagulls, emboldened by the early morning quiet, shrieked at her with greedy intent, hoping for a dropped fish or a discarded chip. Maggie ignored them, her focus narrowed to the task at hand. The old wooden planks, warped and worn by years of relentless sea air, groaned under her weight, echoing the ache in her joints. The smell of salt, seaweed, and the faint, pungent odor of fish permeated the air, a familiar comfort to her, like an old friend. She clutched her steaming mug of tea a little tighter, her breath puffing out in small, white clouds. Today was the day. Today, the new residents arrived. And she was already late.

**Setting:**

The story takes place in **Port Blossom**, a small, windswept coastal town in **Maine, USA**. It's late **November**, just before the official start of winter. The town's primary industry is tourism, particularly in the summer months, but now, the crowds have dwindled, leaving behind a quiet, almost desolate atmosphere. Many of the shops and restaurants are closed for the season, their windows boarded up against the harsh weather.

The specific location within Port Blossom central to the story is the **"Seabreeze Sanctuary,"** a non-profit marine animal rescue and rehabilitation center. It's located just off the main boardwalk, clinging precariously to the edge of the coastline. The sanctuary consists of a collection of weathered wooden buildings, interconnected by a network of ramps and walkways. Inside, there are various tanks, pools, and enclosures, each meticulously designed to mimic the natural habitats of the creatures in their care. The buildings are surrounded by a tall, chain-link fence to protect the animals from the elements and unwanted visitors. The overall feel of the sanctuary is one of quiet dedication and a deep respect for the ocean and its inhabitants. It's a place of healing, a haven against the relentless forces of nature, and Maggie Davies is its steadfast guardian.
