The chipped, florescent bulb above his desk hummed a weary tune, mimicking the low-grade anxiety thrumming in Frederick Bartholomew Higgins' chest. Outside, the November rain hammered against the grimy windows of the "Get Your Taxes Did Right" office, a relentless percussion that mirrored the relentless pressure of the upcoming tax season.

Frederick Bartholomew Higgins, a man whose life was as meticulously organized as a perfectly balanced spreadsheet, sat hunched over a stack of crumpled receipts, his brow furrowed in concentration. The air in the tiny office, nestled on the less-than-glamorous side of downtown Providence, Rhode Island, was thick with the scent of stale coffee, cheap paper, and a faint undercurrent of desperation â€“ the desperation of his clients, and, if he was being honest, a little bit of his own.

The office itself was a testament to practicality over aesthetics. A faded, mustard-yellow carpet fought a losing battle against the tracked-in grime. Walls, once painted a cheerful sky-blue, were now peeling in places, revealing patches of the dreary gray plaster beneath. A second-hand desk, scarred with years of spilled coffee and angry pen marks, dominated the cramped space. It was a setting that screamed "trustworthy, but budget-conscious," a perfect representation of the services Frederick offered. He wasn't glamorous, he wasn't flashy, but he could find you every deductible penny the law allowed. And in Providence, Rhode Island, that was a skill worth its weight in gold.
