## Story Opening & Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The weight of Mrs. Featherbottom’s ridiculous, sequin-encrusted poodle carrier almost brought Bartholomew “Bart” Higgins to his knees. He shifted the monstrosity, the plastic handle biting into his gloved hand, and plastered on his most charming, albeit strained, bellhop smile. “Right this way, madam,” he chirped, his voice echoing slightly in the vast, opulent lobby. He hoped, prayed, that the damn dog inside wasn’t going to start barking again. He'd already endured a near-death experience with a chihuahua named Napoleon earlier this morning, and his nerves were about as frayed as the silk tassels on the lobby’s enormous chandelier.

**Setting:**

The grand, newly renovated "Azure Grand Hotel" in Monte Carlo. Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, reflecting off the pristine marble floors and the glittering Swarovski crystal sculptures that adorned every available surface. The air hung thick with the scent of exotic orchids and expensive cologne, a symphony of wealth and indulgence. From the sweeping staircase, crafted from imported Italian marble, to the impeccably dressed clientele sipping champagne at the lobby bar, everything screamed extravagance. The Azure Grand catered to the world's elite: royalty, celebrities, and individuals whose fortunes could buy and sell small countries. It was a far cry from Bart's tiny, one-bedroom apartment above the local laundromat, a stark contrast he was reminded of every single day.
