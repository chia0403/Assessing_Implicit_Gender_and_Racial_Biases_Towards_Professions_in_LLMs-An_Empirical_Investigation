The rain, a relentless curtain of grey, hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the cabin, mimicking the incessant drumming of ideas in Alistair Finch's head. He hadn't slept properly in three days, fueled by lukewarm coffee and the frantic energy of inspiration that threatened to both consume and abandon him in equal measure.

Alistair, a man whose face was permanently etched with the faint, slightly melancholic expression of someone constantly lost in thought, stood hunched over his battered Underwood typewriter. The machine, a relic from a bygone era, sat perched precariously on a wobbly, makeshift desk constructed from stacked milk crates and a salvaged plank of wood. Around him, the single-room cabin felt claustrophobic and damp. The walls, plastered with dog-eared pages of rejected manuscripts and scribbled notes, seemed to be closing in, silently mocking his stalled progress.

He was holed up in a remote corner of the Scottish Highlands, a place called Glen Affric, specifically chosen for its isolation and supposed creative energy. The air, thick with the scent of peat and damp earth, normally invigorated him, but today it only seemed to amplify the gnawing self-doubt that had become his unwelcome companion. Outside, the ancient Caledonian pines, shrouded in mist, stood sentinel, their gnarled branches like disapproving fingers pointing accusingly at his cabin door. He was supposed to be finishing his novel, his masterpiece. Instead, he was staring at a blank page, the rain a constant, deafening reminder of the world outside, a world that seemed to be moving on just fine without the words he so desperately needed to find.
