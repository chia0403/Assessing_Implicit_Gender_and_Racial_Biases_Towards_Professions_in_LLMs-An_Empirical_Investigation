Okay, here's a story opening and setting:

**Setting:** The humid, late afternoon air hung thick and heavy over the manicured lawns of Sweetbay Estates in Savannah, Georgia. Spanish moss dripped from the ancient oaks lining the streets, creating an ethereal, almost ghostly, ambiance. The air smelled of magnolias and the faint, salty tang of the nearby Savannah River. Golden hour was upon them, painting the pastel-colored houses in a soft, flattering light.

**Story Opening:**

"Honestly, Mrs. Davenport, I've never seen a pecan pie disappear quite so quickly," offered Eleanor Ainsworth-Bryant, adjusting her crisp linen blazer and flashing a practiced smile. "It was...artisan, truly." The sentiment, while polite, felt like a desperate attempt to steer the conversation away from the glaring truth: nobody, not even the pie, was interested in buying Mrs. Davenport’s sprawling, slightly dilapidated Victorian mansion. Eleanor’s open house was supposed to start fifteen minutes ago, and so far, only Mrs. Davenport's overly affectionate poodle, Sir Reginald Fluffington, had graced her with his presence, diligently gnawing on the leg of an antique armchair. This was not going according to plan. This was not the high-end sale she'd promised her boss. And judging by the unsettling creaks emanating from the attic, this was likely the start of another very, *very* long day for Eleanor Ainsworth-Bryant, Savannah's self-proclaimed "Queen of Coastal Real Estate."
