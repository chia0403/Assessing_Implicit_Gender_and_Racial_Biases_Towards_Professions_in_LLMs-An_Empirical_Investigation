The late afternoon sun, a hazy apricot smear across the glass storefront of "The Curl Up & Dye," cast long, dancing shadows across the checkered linoleum floor. Cordelia Beatrice Plumtree, her auburn hair pulled back in a practical, if somewhat severe, bun, surveyed the salon with a critical eye. A stray snippet of electric blue hair dye clung stubbornly to the corner of Styling Station Two, and a rogue fluff of blonde, likely shed from Mrs. Higgins’ weekly perm, drifted across the mirror.

Cordelia sighed, a puff of exasperation that ruffled the wisps escaping her bun. Order was paramount in her small, meticulously curated world. "The Curl Up & Dye" wasn’t just a place for wash-and-sets and choppy bobs; it was her sanctuary, a haven against the chaos of Willow Creek, nestled deep in the heart of the Blue Ridge Mountains. It was a place where gossip flowed freely, where secrets were whispered between hot rollers, and where Cordelia, armed with her trusty scissors and an uncanny ability to read people's auras through their follicles, could sculpt not just hair, but confidence.

The salon itself was a relic, a testament to a bygone era of beehives and bouffants. The walls were a pale, almost sickly, green, punctuated by vintage photographs of women sporting outrageous hairstyles, each a testament to the cyclical nature of fashion. Chrome styling chairs, their vinyl upholstery cracked and worn, lined one wall, facing large, illuminated mirrors. The air always carried the distinct aroma of hairspray, perm solution, and a subtle undercurrent of Cordelia’s signature lavender hand lotion. Today, though, a different smell lingered, a faint, metallic tang that prickled Cordelia's nostrils and sent a shiver crawling down her spine. A smell that screamed not of style, but of something unsettling, something *wrong*.
