## Story Opening and Setting:

The rain hammered against the wide, colorful windows of the "Sunbeams" classroom at Maplewood Elementary, mirroring the frantic tapping in Mrs. Beatrice Clementine Butterfield’s chest. Normally, a blustery autumn day like this would be welcomed by her five-year-olds; a perfect excuse for indoor games, story time, and perhaps even a spontaneous construction project using the oversized building blocks. But today, the rhythmic drumming against the glass seemed to amplify the quiet tension that had settled over the room like a damp blanket.

Maplewood Elementary, nestled in the heart of Willow Creek, Vermont, was a haven of vibrant learning. Bright murals depicting local wildlife adorned the hallways, and the scent of crayon wax and freshly baked cookies often permeated the air, courtesy of the parent volunteers. The "Sunbeams" classroom, in particular, was Beatrice’s pride and joy. Filled with cozy reading nooks, a miniature kitchen overflowing with plastic food, and a jungle gym disguised as a friendly green tree, it was a place where imagination thrived. But today, even the usually boisterous laughter and squeals were replaced by hushed whispers and anxious glances towards the clock.

The news had spread like wildfire amongst the parents: little Timmy Henderson was missing. Last seen playing in his backyard late yesterday afternoon, he was gone. And while the police assured everyone they were doing everything they could, Beatrice knew, in the unspoken language of mothers and teachers, that time was running out.
