Okay, here's a story opening with setting and a main character:

**Opening:**

The tremor started in his right hand, a barely perceptible twitch at first. Then, a rhythmic pulse ran up his arm, a little electrical jolt mimicking the frantic ticker tape scrolling across the monitors in front of him. Richard Edward Abernathy, a man who normally commanded a room with the casual authority of a seasoned general, fought to keep his composure. He needed to be steady. He needed to be sharp. The market was a goddamn bloodbath today, and he was knee-deep in the carnage.

**Setting:**

The year is 2008. Richard's office, a corner suite on the 47th floor of the Blackwood Financial building in Lower Manhattan, offered a panoramic view of the Hudson River. Normally, the sight of the Statue of Liberty, a sentinel of hope and opportunity, calmed him. Today, it felt like it was flipping him off.

The office was a testament to understated wealth. Dark mahogany desk, impeccably organized. Leather armchairs that had likely cost more than a decent used car. A signed first edition of *Reminiscences of a Stock Operator* sat on a shelf, a constant reminder of both the potential riches and the devastating pitfalls of the game. The air crackled with the nervous energy of a battlefield. Phones rang incessantly. Shouts and frustrated groans echoed from the open-plan trading floor just outside his closed door. A half-empty glass of amber liquid sat sweating on his desk. It wasn't whiskey. Not yet, anyway. It was only 10:30 AM.
