Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring an occupational therapist:

**Story Opening:**

The rhythmic squeak of her worn Doc Martens against the linoleum was the only sound that pierced the suffocating silence. Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Ainsworth paused just outside Room 312, took a deep breath, and plastered on her most encouraging smile â€“ a smile she sometimes felt was more practiced than genuine. Today, the smile felt particularly fragile.

The air in the hallway clung to the smell of disinfectant and despair, a potent combination that Ellie had grown accustomed to, but never quite comfortable with, over her ten years as an occupational therapist. Inside that room waited Mrs. Petrov, and the knowledge that Ellie was the last line of defense between Mrs. Petrov and a bleak, institutional future weighed heavily. *Another day, another mountain to climb,* she thought, her hand hovering over the cold metal doorknob. With a final, silent pep talk, she pushed it open.

**Setting:**

The story is primarily set in the **Evergreen Rehabilitation Center**, a sprawling, somewhat dated, facility located on the outskirts of Portland, Oregon. Evergreen serves a diverse patient population, ranging from individuals recovering from strokes and traumatic brain injuries to those managing chronic conditions like arthritis and Parkinson's disease.

*   **The Atmosphere:** The center, despite the best efforts of its staff, has a sterile, impersonal feel. The walls are painted in muted, institutional shades of green and beige, and the corridors are often dimly lit, creating a somewhat gloomy atmosphere. While there are attempts to add cheerfulness with colorful artwork and potted plants, the overall ambiance is one of clinical detachment.

*   **Key Locations:** Specific locations within Evergreen include:
    *   **The Occupational Therapy Gym:** A large, brightly lit space filled with a variety of adaptive equipment, including parallel bars, therapy balls, and specialized tools designed to help patients regain lost skills.
    *   **Individual Patient Rooms:** These rooms are often cramped and sparsely furnished, reflecting the temporary nature of the patients' stay.
    *   **The Staff Lounge:** A small, cluttered room where the staff gathers to take breaks and share stories (and sometimes, anxieties).
    *   **The Outdoor Therapy Garden:** A small, enclosed garden designed to provide a calming and therapeutic environment for patients. (Although, the Oregon weather doesn't always cooperate)

The story may also occasionally venture beyond the walls of Evergreen, offering glimpses into Ellie's personal life and the vibrant city of Portland.
