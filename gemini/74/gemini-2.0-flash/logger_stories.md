Okay, here's a story opening, including the setting and the main character's name, with him being a logger:

**Setting:** The biting wind howled through the ancient hemlocks and Douglas firs of the Olympic National Forest in Washington State. It was late November, and the early winter snow clung to the underbrush, a stark white blanket against the deep, evergreen tapestry. The air smelled of damp earth, pine resin, and the sharp tang of gasoline from the nearby machinery. A low, persistent fog clung to the higher slopes, swallowing the mountain peaks whole.

**Opening:**

"Goddamn it to hell, Silas," a voice crackled over the CB radio, cutting through the predawn quiet. "You moving slower than a three-legged bear this morning? Get that Cat of yours warmed up, we gotta hit quota today."

Silas Tanner, his breath fogging the air as he exhaled, tightened his grip on the mug of lukewarm coffee. The metallic tang of the thermos bit at his tongue, a familiar discomfort on these cold mornings. "Morning to you too, Earl," he grumbled back into the radio, his voice raspy from years of chewing tobacco and shouting over the roar of chainsaws. "Give a man time to say hello to the day, will ya? Even if the day *is* tryin' to freeze my balls off."

He ignored Earl's answering cackle and clambered up onto the seat of his Caterpillar D8 bulldozer. The cold metal bit into his calloused hands, even through his thick leather gloves. Turning the key, he waited for the engine to cough, sputter, and then finally roar to life, a beast awakening from a slumber. Silas Tanner was a man built for this, a man of the forest. He’d been logging these mountains since he was a boy, following in his father’s and grandfather’s footsteps. But lately, something felt different. The quotas were getting higher, the trees smaller, and the silence after a section was cleared felt… wrong.  He knew, deep in his bones, that the old ways, the ways he'd been taught, were dying.
