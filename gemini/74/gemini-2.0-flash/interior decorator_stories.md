## Story Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

The scent of old money and beeswax polish clung to Eleanor Beatrice Vance like a well-tailored coat. It wasn't unpleasant, not exactly, but after a day spent wrestling with stubborn antique furniture and the even more stubborn sensibilities of her clientele, it was a smell that screamed of unmet expectations and imminent migraines. Eleanor pinched the bridge of her nose, the faint indentation from her glasses already forming. She sighed, a quiet rustle in the echoing silence of the grand foyer.

**Setting:**

Eleanor stood in the opulent, if somewhat decaying, entrance hall of Blackwood Manor, located on the windswept cliffs overlooking the jagged Cornish coastline. The Manor, a sprawling gothic masterpiece built in the late 18th century, boasted towering ceilings, stained glass windows depicting scenes from Arthurian legend, and enough dark oak paneling to bankrupt a small lumber mill. Outside, the relentless roar of the Atlantic Ocean competed with the mournful cry of seagulls. Inside, the air was thick with the weight of history â€“ and the faint, lingering aroma of mothballs. Blackwood Manor, once the pride of Cornwall, had fallen into disrepair, a monument to a faded glory. Now, it was Eleanor Vance's job, and perhaps her curse, to breathe new life into its aged bones.
