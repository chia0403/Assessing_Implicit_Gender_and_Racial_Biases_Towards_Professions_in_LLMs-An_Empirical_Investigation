## Opening:

The fluorescent lights of Server Room B hummed a monotonous dirge, a soundtrack familiar to Evelyn Anya Sharma as the rhythmic clatter of her keyboard. A bead of sweat trickled down her temple, tracing a path through the grime accumulated from days spent barricaded within these walls. She stabbed at the 'Enter' key, sending another query into the labyrinthine database. Another 'ERROR'. Frustration, a constant companion these last few weeks, tightened its grip. This wasn't just a bug; this was a phantom, a glitch that defied logic and threatened to unravel the entire launch of Project Chimera, the company's flagship AI, set to revolutionize the world of data analysis. Evelyn, Lead Programmer for the project, felt the weight of the world, or at least the weight of a billion-dollar enterprise, squarely on her shoulders. She pushed back from her cluttered desk, a battlefield of energy drink cans and discarded code printouts, and stared at the blinking cursor on her screen. Time was running out.

## Setting:

The year is 2042. Project Chimera, and thus Evelynâ€™s life, currently resides in the sterile, climate-controlled environment of Server Room B, located three stories underground beneath the sprawling headquarters of OmniCorp in Neo-Manhattan. The room itself is a functional box, dominated by rows upon rows of towering server racks, their blinking lights casting an eerie, pulsing glow. Thick cables snake across the floor like metallic vines. The air is thick with the scent of ozone and the low thrum of cooling fans. A single, utilitarian desk sits in the corner, covered in a chaotic assortment of tech equipment, half-empty coffee cups, and crumpled paper. The walls are painted a depressing shade of grey, but Evelyn has tried to soften the harshness with a few motivational posters, mostly featuring inspirational quotes about perseverance. Outside the heavy, magnetically sealed doors, lies the gleaming, futuristic cityscape of Neo-Manhattan, a testament to the power and progress OmniCorp represents, a stark contrast to the claustrophobic, pressure-cooker environment of Server Room B.
