Beyond the single, grime-streaked window, the Appalachian Mountains rose, dark and brooding under the bruised purple sky, mirroring the turmoil in her heart.  Tonight, the silence between the raindrops felt heavier than the rain itself, a silence only the raw, aching melody escaping her guitar seemed brave enough to pierce.
