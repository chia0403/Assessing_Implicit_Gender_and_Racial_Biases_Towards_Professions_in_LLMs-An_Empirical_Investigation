The fluorescent lights of "Quick Stop Mart" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Hernandez's Tuesday afternoon.  Amelia, meticulously straightening the already-straight row of discounted energy drinks, sighed. The air hung thick and sweet, a cloying blend of stale coffee, cheap air freshener attempting to mask the lingering scent of week-old hotdogs, and the faint, metallic tang of spilled soda. Outside, the relentless Texas sun beat down on the cracked asphalt of the parking lot, baking the already sweltering interior of the Quick Stop even hotter.  Amelia wished, not for the first time, that she'd opted for the air-conditioned misery of the library instead of this stifling, sugar-fueled purgatory.  Her name tag, slightly askew, read simply "Amelia," but to the regulars, she was "Sweet Amelia," a title she both cherished and secretly resented.
