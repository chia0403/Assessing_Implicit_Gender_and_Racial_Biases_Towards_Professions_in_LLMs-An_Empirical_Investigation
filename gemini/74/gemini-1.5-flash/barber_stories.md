The air hung thick and sweet with the cloying scent of bay rum and stale pipe tobacco, a familiar perfume in Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's barbershop. Dust motes, illuminated by the single, unshaded bulb hanging above the worn leather barber chair, danced in the afternoon sun that slanted through the grimy window.  Barty, his fingers stained a permanent ochre from years of handling hair dye, carefully honed the edge of his straight razor on a worn strop, the rhythmic hiss a counterpoint to the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner, its pendulum a metronome marking the slow, deliberate pace of life in the sleepy town of Oakhaven.  Outside, the wind whispered secrets through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks that gave the town its name, a stark contrast to the quiet, almost reverent atmosphere within Barty's sanctuary.
