The chipped porcelain sink groaned under the weight of Elara Genevieve Hawthorne's elbows. Steam, thick and fragrant with lemon and pine, swirled around her face, blurring the already faded floral wallpaper of the manor's kitchen.

Outside, a November wind howled, rattling the ancient windowpanes, a mournful counterpoint to the creaking of the old house settling into its age. Blackwood Manor itself was a character in this story, a brooding, gothic pile of grey stone that seemed to suck the warmth from the very air.  Its secrets, Elara suspected, were as ingrained in its fabric as the mildew in the damp cellars.
