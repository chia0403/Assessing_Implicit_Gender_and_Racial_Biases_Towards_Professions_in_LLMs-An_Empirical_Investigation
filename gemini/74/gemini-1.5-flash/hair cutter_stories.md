The scent of lavender and ozone hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume unique to Shear Perfection, a salon nestled on the crooked, cobbled street of Rue des Fleurs in Montmartre.  Rain lashed against the tall, narrow windows, blurring the already hazy Parisian cityscape into a watercolor wash of grey and ochre.  Inside, however, was a haven of warmth and quiet industry.  The only sound louder than the rhythmic snip-snip of scissors was the low hum of the heated towel cabinet.  Isabelle Dubois, her fingers nimble and sure, expertly sculpted a cascade of auburn curls, her dark eyes focused on her work with an almost meditative intensity.  The client, a petite woman with a cloud of nervous energy, shifted uneasily under the weight of Isabelleâ€™s practiced touch.  Isabelle, however, remained unfazed, a practiced calm radiating from her as she transformed chaos into art.
