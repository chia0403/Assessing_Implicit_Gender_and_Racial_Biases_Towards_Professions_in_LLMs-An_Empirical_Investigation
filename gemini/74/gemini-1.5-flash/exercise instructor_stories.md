The pre-dawn chill nipped at Amelia “Mia” Hernandez’s cheeks as she unlocked the gym doors.  The air inside Spin & Sculpt, a cavernous space smelling faintly of sweat and ambition, hung heavy and silent, broken only by the rhythmic hum of the ventilation system.  Rows of gleaming spin bikes stood like metallic sentinels, their handlebars and seats pristine under the dim, early-morning light.  Beyond them, the weight room lay shrouded in shadow, the only illumination coming from the emergency exit sign, casting a sickly green glow on the polished steel of the dumbbell racks.  Mia shivered, pulling her fleece tighter around her, the dampness clinging to her despite her waterproof jacket. This was her domain, her kingdom of sculpted bodies and endorphin highs, but even the promise of the day's high-energy class couldn't quite banish the unsettling quiet before the storm of bodies and beats began.  Outside, the first hints of sunrise were painting the sky a bruised purple, a stark contrast to the hushed intensity within.
