The scent of lilies, heady and almost cloying, hung heavy in the air above Amelia "Mia" Hawthorne's floral workshop.  Rain lashed against the leaded-glass windows of the converted stable, a rhythmic drumming that underscored the hushed murmur of Mia's humming.  Dust motes, illuminated by the afternoon sun struggling to pierce the grey clouds, danced in the shafts of light slicing through the gloom.  Workbenches overflowed with a chaotic symphony of color: crimson roses still damp from their journey from the fields, vibrant sunflowers vying for space with delicate orchids, and bundles of fragrant lavender tied with rustic twine.  Outside, the cobbled lane of Willow Creek was deserted, the only sound the relentless rain and the occasional distant rumble of a farm tractor.  This was Mia's sanctuary, her haven amidst the quiet chaos of her small village life; a life she loved, until this morningâ€™s phone call.
