The fluorescent lights of the "Deals on Wheels" showroom hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Elias Thorne's meticulously crafted sales pitch.  Elias, a man whose smile could sell sand to a Bedouin and whose handshake could seal a deal faster than a speeding ticket, adjusted his tie – a power blue, naturally – and glanced at the shimmering, cherry-red convertible perched on the polished concrete floor.  It was a beauty, a 1967 Mustang fastback, a collector's item, and Elias's biggest challenge yet.  The air hung thick with the cloying scent of new car leather and the faint, almost imperceptible, whiff of desperation emanating from the prospective buyer, a nervous-looking man in a rumpled suit, fidgeting with a chipped mug of lukewarm coffee.  Outside, the relentless Arizona sun beat down on the sprawling dealership, promising another scorcher of a day – a day Elias intended to conquer, one sale at a time.
