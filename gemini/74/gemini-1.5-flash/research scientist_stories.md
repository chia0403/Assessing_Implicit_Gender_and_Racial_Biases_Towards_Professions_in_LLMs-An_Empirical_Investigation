The biting Antarctic wind howled a mournful song around Dr. Evelyn Reed’s reinforced research station, a symphony of ice grinding against ice that had played incessantly for the past three months.  Evelyn, bundled in layers of thermal gear that restricted her movement more than a straitjacket, squinted at the swirling blizzard.  Visibility was down to near zero, the white expanse outside a swirling vortex of frozen fury.  Lake Vostok, the vast subglacial lake hidden beneath miles of ice, lay dormant and unseen, a tantalizing secret held captive by the unforgiving landscape.  Inside the station, the air hummed with the quiet thrum of generators, a fragile heartbeat against the deafening roar of the outside world.  Evelyn, however, was focused on the erratic blips on the sonar screen, a tremor in the otherwise stable readings that had her heart pounding a frantic counterpoint to the station’s life support systems.  Something was stirring down there, beneath the ice, something unexpected, something…alive.
