The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face as he wrestled the recalcitrant antenna cable.  The wind, a raw, relentless beast from the north, howled like a banshee across the desolate, windswept cliffs of Cape Wrath, threatening to rip the entire structure – a ramshackle collection of rusted metal and whipping wires – from its precarious perch.  Below, the churning grey Atlantic thundered against the jagged rocks, a constant, deafening roar that competed with the shriek of the wind and the insistent buzz of the faulty transmitter Elias was attempting to fix.  The only other sound was the rhythmic *clack-clack-clack* of his own tools against the metal, a tiny counterpoint to the overwhelming power of the elements.  This remote lighthouse, perched precariously on the edge of nowhere, was Elias's office for the foreseeable future, a stark contrast to the bustling city radio station he'd left behind.
