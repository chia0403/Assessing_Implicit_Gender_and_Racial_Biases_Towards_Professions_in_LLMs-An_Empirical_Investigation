The salt spray stung Amelia Hernandez's face as she hauled the last crate of glistening, ice-cold oysters onto the deck of the *Salty Siren*.

This wasn't just any delivery; these were the prized Prince Edward Island oysters, the cream of the crop, crucial to the meticulously planned tasting menu she'd designed for the prestigious "Taste of the Coast" gala.  The air hung thick with the smell of brine and diesel, a far cry from the refined elegance of the ballroom awaiting her culinary creations.
