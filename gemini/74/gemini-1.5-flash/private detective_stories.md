The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Jack Stratton's office, a relentless percussion that mirrored the throbbing headache behind his eyes.  The air hung thick with the smell of stale coffee, cheap cigarettes, and the lingering ghost of last night's bourbon â€“ a potent cocktail of regret and impending doom.  Jack Stratton, Private Investigator, sat hunched over a chipped Formica desk, the flickering neon sign outside casting long, skeletal shadows across his face.  His office, a cramped cubicle above a laundromat in the perpetually rain-soaked city of Astoria, Oregon, was as bleak and uninviting as the case file he was currently reviewing: a missing person, a cryptic note, and a client whose desperation reeked more of guilt than grief.  The flickering neon sign outside momentarily went dark, plunging the office into absolute darkness, leaving Jack alone with the drumming rain and the gnawing feeling that this case was far more complicated than it appeared.
