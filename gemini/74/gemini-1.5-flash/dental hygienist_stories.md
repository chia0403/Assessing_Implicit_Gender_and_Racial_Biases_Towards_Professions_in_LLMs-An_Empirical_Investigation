The sterile scent of antiseptic, usually comforting to Anya Petrova, felt suffocating tonight.  Fluorescent lights hummed a discordant tune above her, reflecting harshly off the stainless steel instruments laid out on the gleaming tray.  Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Albright's dental practice, blurring the already hazy cityscape of Seattle into a watercolor of grey and black.  Anya, still in her crisp white scrubs, meticulously checked her ultrasonic scaler, the tiny vibrations a counterpoint to the tempest outside.  It was well past closing time, and the only other occupant of the building was the ancient, wheezing furnace in the basement, a sound that tonight felt more like a groan of impending doom than a comforting warmth.  The silence, broken only by the rhythmic tick-tock of the wall clock and the relentless drumming of the rain, was unsettling.  Anya had stayed late, not for work, but because the storm had trapped her here, and the thought of navigating the treacherous streets alone filled her with a far greater dread than any root canal.
