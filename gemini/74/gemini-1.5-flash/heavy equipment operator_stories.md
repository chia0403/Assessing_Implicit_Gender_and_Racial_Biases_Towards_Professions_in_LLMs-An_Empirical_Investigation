The diesel engine coughed, a throaty rumble that vibrated through the steel floor of the cab and up into Amelia "Mia" Hernandez's bones.  Dawn painted the eastern sky in bruised purples and oranges, illuminating the vast, dust-choked expanse of the Arizona desert.  Ahead, a monstrous Caterpillar D11T, its tracks like colossal metal caterpillars, waited patiently, its hydraulics humming a low, expectant song.  Mia, her face smudged with grease and her work boots caked in red Arizona clay, ran a hand through her short, dark hair, the scent of engine oil and sweat clinging to her.  This wasn't some manicured construction site; this was the raw, unforgiving heart of the Sonoran Desert, where the only sounds louder than the earthmovers were the wind's mournful sigh and the occasional hawk's cry.  Today's task: carving a new access road through a particularly stubborn mesa, a job that demanded precision, patience, and a healthy dose of grit â€“ qualities Mia possessed in abundance.
