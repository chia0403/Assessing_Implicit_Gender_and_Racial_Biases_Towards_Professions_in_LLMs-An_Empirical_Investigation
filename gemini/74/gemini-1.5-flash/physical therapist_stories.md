The salt spray stung Dr. Eleanor Vance's face as she wrestled the stubborn fishing net free from the barnacle-encrusted pilings.  The air, thick with the smell of brine and decaying seaweed, whipped her dark hair across her eyes.  She squinted, the late afternoon sun glinting off the choppy waters of the Atlantic, painting the sky in fiery hues of orange and purple.  This wasn't exactly the typical setting for a physical therapist, she thought, pulling with renewed vigour.  But then again, Eleanor Vance had never been one for typical.  She stood on the rickety wooden dock of her family's small, isolated fishing village, Seabrook, Maine â€“ a place where the rhythm of the tides dictated life, and the constant battle against the sea shaped its hardy inhabitants, both physically and emotionally.  The net, finally free, collapsed onto the planks with a heavy thud, mirroring the weight of the secret Eleanor carried, a secret that would soon unravel the quiet tranquility of Seabrook.
