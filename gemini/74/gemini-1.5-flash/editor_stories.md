The chipped mug warmed Amelia “Mia” Blackwood’s hands, the lukewarm tea doing little to chase away the November chill that seeped through the drafty window of her attic office.  Rain lashed against the leaded panes, a relentless percussion accompanying the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of her fingers on the worn wooden desk.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single desk lamp, danced in the weak light, mirroring the chaotic swirl of manuscripts and rejection letters scattered across the surface.  The attic room itself was a testament to years of literary toil: overflowing bookshelves crammed with titles both celebrated and obscure lined the walls, their spines worn smooth from countless readings, their pages whispering forgotten stories.  From her perch, Mia could see the twinkling lights of Edinburgh spread out below, a breathtaking panorama utterly oblivious to the solitary struggle unfolding within her cramped, book-filled sanctuary.
