The fluorescent lights of the Blackwood Academy hummed a discordant symphony, their sickly yellow glow reflecting off the polished linoleum floor.  Dust motes, disturbed by the rhythmic swish of Amelia Hernandez’s mop, danced in the air like tiny, mischievous spirits.  It was 2:17 AM, the official start of Amelia’s shift, a time when the hallowed halls of Blackwood, normally teeming with the privileged and preening, lay hushed and empty, save for the ghosts of forgotten exams and the squeak of her worn-out shoes.  The air hung heavy with the scent of old books and something faintly floral – a lingering perfume from a careless student, perhaps, or maybe just the phantom smell of Amelia's own lavender-scented cleaning solution, a small comfort in the cavernous silence.  Tonight, however, the silence felt…different.  Heavier.  More expectant.
