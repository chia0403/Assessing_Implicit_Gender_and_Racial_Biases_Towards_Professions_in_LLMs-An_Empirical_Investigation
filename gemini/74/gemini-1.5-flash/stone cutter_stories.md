The rasp of granite against steel echoed through the cavernous workshop, a counterpoint to the rhythmic clang of Elara Stonewhisper's hammer.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single, sputtering oil lamp hanging above her workbench, danced in the air like tiny, frantic spirits.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful song across the desolate moorland surrounding the village of Oakhaven, a song that matched the grim determination etched onto Elara's face as she worked.  The biting chill seeped through the cracks in the stone walls of the workshop, a constant reminder of the unforgiving landscape that had shaped both her and the rugged, grey stone she tirelessly transformed.  The air itself smelled of wet earth, cold iron, and the sharp, almost acrid scent of freshly cut granite â€“ the smell of a life lived close to the earth and its immutable secrets.
