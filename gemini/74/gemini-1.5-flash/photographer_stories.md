The biting wind whipped Amelia Jean Holloway's hair across her face, stinging her cheeks a vibrant, angry red that mirrored the setting sun bleeding across the Alaskan sky.  She tugged her worn leather gloves tighter, the icy grip of the Chugach Mountains a stark contrast to the warmth of her camera bag slung across her shoulder.  The air hung thick with the scent of pine and something else, something primal and untamed â€“ the lingering ghost of a recent snowstorm mingling with the metallic tang of the ocean air.  Amelia, her breath puffing out in ragged white clouds, adjusted her lens, her gaze fixed on a lone wolf silhouetted against the fiery horizon, its form a breathtaking study in shadows and light.  This was it, the shot she'd travelled thousands of miles for, the apex of her year-long project documenting the wildlife of the Alaskan wilderness.  The last light was fading fast, and with it, her chance.
