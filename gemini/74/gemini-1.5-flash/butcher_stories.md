The rasp of the cleaver, a sound as familiar to Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield as his own heartbeat, sliced through the pre-dawn chill of the Smithfield market.  Barty, his breath misting in the frigid air, wielded the blade with the practiced ease of a conductor leading an orchestra.  Around him, the cobblestones gleamed wetly under the weak light of gas lamps, reflecting the crimson hues spilling from the overflowing stalls of lamb, pork, and beef. The air, thick with the metallic tang of blood and the earthy scent of offal, hung heavy with the promise of another long, demanding day.  A lone stray cat, its fur the color of charcoal, stalked between the legs of a slumbering porter, its yellow eyes gleaming with predatory intent, mirroring the keen gaze Barty himself held on the prime cut of ox before him.  This wasn't just a job; it was a ritual, a dance with life and death played out under the unforgiving gaze of the London sky.
