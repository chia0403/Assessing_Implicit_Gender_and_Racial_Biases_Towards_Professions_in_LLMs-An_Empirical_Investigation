The midday sun beat down on Elias Thorne's neck, turning the sweat already beading on his forehead into a warm, sticky river.  The air, thick with the smell of asphalt and exhaust fumes, shimmered above the cracked surface of Highway 17.  Elias, clad in a faded orange vest that had seen better days – and far fewer sunburns – squinted at the distant rumble of approaching traffic.  He adjusted the worn brim of his hard hat, the familiar weight a small comfort against the oppressive heat.  The relentless drone of the road grader behind him was a counterpoint to the symphony of tires on asphalt, a constant reminder of the slow, steady work that defined his days – and, lately, his nights. He was halfway through patching a particularly nasty pothole, a chasm in the road that threatened to swallow a car whole, and the frustration gnawed at him as fiercely as the sun.  The endless ribbon of Highway 17, stretching north towards the seemingly limitless expanse of the Mojave Desert, felt less like a road and more like a sentence without parole.
