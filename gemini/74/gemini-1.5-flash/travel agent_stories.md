The chipped paint of Amelia Hernandez’s desk matched the chipped veneer of her optimism.  Rain lashed against the window of her tiny travel agency, “Wanderlust & Co.”, a pathetically inadequate name considering the current state of affairs.  The once-vibrant turquoise walls were now dulled by years of neglect, punctuated only by the faded posters depicting idyllic beaches and snow-capped mountains – landscapes as distant and unattainable as Amelia’s next commission.  The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and a lingering disappointment that seemed to cling to the very fabric of the worn, floral armchair in the corner. Outside, the grey November sky of Dublin mirrored the gloom settling over Amelia’s heart.  Another day, another unanswered phone, another brochure gathering dust.
