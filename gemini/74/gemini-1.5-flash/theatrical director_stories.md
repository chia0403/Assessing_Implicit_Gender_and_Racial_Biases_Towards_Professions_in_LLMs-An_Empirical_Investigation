The stale scent of sawdust and forgotten dreams clung to the air in the dilapidated theatre, a perfume only Bartholomew "Barty" Finch truly appreciated.  Dust motes, illuminated by a single bare bulb hanging precariously above, danced in the cavernous space, mirroring the frantic flutter in Barty’s chest.  The Grand Majestic Theatre, once a beacon of glittering glamour, now stood as a skeletal reminder of a bygone era, its peeling gilt paint a testament to decades of neglect.  Its grand proscenium arch, chipped and cracked but still undeniably majestic, framed a stage littered with discarded props – a rusting crown, a cobweb-draped chaise lounge, and a single, forlorn tap shoe.  Tonight, however, this forgotten mausoleum of thespian ambition was Barty's canvas, and the premiere of his ambitious, possibly insane, new production of "King Lear" was mere hours away.
