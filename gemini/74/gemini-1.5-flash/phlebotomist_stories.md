The fluorescent lights of the St. Jude's County Hospital lab hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the frantic rhythm of Amelia “Mia” Hernandez’s heartbeat.  It wasn't the usual pre-shift jitters; those were a dull thrum she’d long since learned to ignore.  No, this was different.  This was the tight, anxious flutter of a butterfly trapped in a mason jar, the kind that threatened to burst free and scatter her meticulously organized world into chaotic disarray.  Rain lashed against the panoramic windows overlooking the parking lot, mirroring the storm brewing inside her.  The scent of antiseptic and something faintly metallic – the ghost of a spilled vial, perhaps – hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume that tonight felt suffocating.  Mia adjusted the crisp white collar of her lab coat, the starched fabric a stark contrast to the nervous tremor in her hands.  Tonight, she wasn't just drawing blood; tonight, she was facing her past.
