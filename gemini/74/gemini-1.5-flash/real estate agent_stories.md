The relentless Miami sun beat down on Seraphina “Sera” Valencia’s shoulders, turning the already shimmering turquoise waters of Biscayne Bay into a blinding spectacle.  Sweat beaded on her forehead, clinging to the perfectly applied makeup she’d painstakingly applied that morning, a testament to her unwavering commitment to professionalism, even in the face of a suffocating humidity that could melt asphalt.  Sera adjusted the designer sunglasses perched on her nose, the expensive frames a stark contrast to the slightly scuffed heels of her ivory pumps, a reminder that even a top-producing real estate agent in Coconut Grove had to choose between appearances and practicality sometimes. Today, practicality had lost.  She surveyed the sprawling, pastel-colored mansion before her, its terracotta roof tiles gleaming like polished jewels under the merciless sun. This wasn't just any property; this was the *Delacroix Estate*, a legendary piece of Miami history, and Sera was about to show it to a client whose wealth could rival the state of Florida itself.
