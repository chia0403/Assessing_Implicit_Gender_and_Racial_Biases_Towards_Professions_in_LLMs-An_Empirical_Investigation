The dawn mist clung to the manicured lawns of Blackwood Manor like a shroud, clinging to the dew-kissed blades of grass and obscuring the wrought-iron gates in a pearly haze.  Arthur Penhaligon, his breath puffing out in white clouds,  pulled his worn tweed cap lower over his ears. The chill of the October morning bit deep, seeping into his bones despite the thick layers of wool beneath his waterproof jacket.  He surveyed his domain â€“ acres of meticulously kept gardens, sprawling lawns that stretched towards a looming, gothic mansion, its many windows dark and silent.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, a familiar perfume to Arthur, a constant companion throughout his thirty years tending the grounds of Blackwood Manor.
