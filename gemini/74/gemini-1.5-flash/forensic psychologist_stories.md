The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the abandoned warehouse, a relentless rhythm echoing the frantic beat of Dr. Eleanor Vance’s heart.  Each drop was a tiny percussionist in the symphony of decay that surrounded her, a counterpoint to the sterile silence of the lab she’d painstakingly constructed within the crumbling shell.
