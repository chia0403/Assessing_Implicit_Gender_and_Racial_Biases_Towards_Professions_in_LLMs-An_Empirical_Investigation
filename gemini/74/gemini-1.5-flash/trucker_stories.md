The diesel grumbled a low, guttural song, a counterpoint to the rhythmic thump of tires on cracked asphalt.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of ochre and rust, danced across the Nevada desert, swirling around the eighteen-wheeler like mischievous spirits.  The sun, a malevolent eye in the vast, unforgiving sky, beat down on the cab of the rig, baking the metal until it shimmered with heat.  Inside, however, a cool breeze from the air conditioning fought a losing battle against the oppressive heat.  Behind the wheel, nursing a lukewarm coffee that tasted suspiciously of burnt tires, sat Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins, a man whose face was as weathered and cracked as the desert floor itself.  His trucker hat, worn low, shaded eyes that had seen too many sunrises and sunsets across this unforgiving landscape.  He was headed to Las Vegas, a glittering mirage shimmering on the horizon, but the desert, as always, held its breath, promising delays and challenges before he reached his destination.
