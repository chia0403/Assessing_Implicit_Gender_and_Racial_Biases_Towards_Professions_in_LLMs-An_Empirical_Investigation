The stale scent of old textbooks and over-ripe bananas clung to the air in the hallway of Northwood High, a fragrance Dr. Eleanor Vance, school psychologist, had come to associate with the onset of another Monday morning.  Fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune above, casting a sickly yellow glow on the peeling paint and the chipped linoleum floor.  Eleanor adjusted the strap of her worn leather satchel, the weight of confidential student files a familiar burden.  Outside, the late October wind howled a mournful dirge through the skeletal branches of the ancient oak trees that lined the school grounds, a fitting soundtrack to the anxieties simmering beneath the surface of Northwood's seemingly ordinary teenage population.  This particular Monday, however, felt heavier than most.  A cryptic note, slipped anonymously under her office door, promised a revelation that would shake the carefully constructed facade of tranquility at Northwood High to its very foundations.
