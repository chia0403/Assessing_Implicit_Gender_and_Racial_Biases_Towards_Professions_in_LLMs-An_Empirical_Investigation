The brass nameplate gleamed under the low, flickering gaslight:  *Aurelia "Relia" Blackwood, Concierge*.  Relia adjusted the crisp white gloves perched on her slender hands, a practiced movement honed over fifteen years of navigating the labyrinthine corridors of the Blackwood Hotel. Rain lashed against the arched windows of the lobby, a furious counterpoint to the hushed elegance within.  The air, thick with the scent of aged mahogany and expensive perfume, held a nervous energy tonight.  It wasn't the usual pre-opera flurry of last-minute requests for tickets and limos; this felt different, sharper, like the prickle of static before a storm.  The grand clock in the hall chimed eleven, each toll a heavy drop in the gathering tension.  Tonight, Relia Blackwood sensed something was amiss, something far beyond a misplaced opera glass or a forgotten anniversary bouquet.
