Amy hunched deeper into her sheepskin-lined jacket, the cold seeping into her bones despite the layers.  The radio crackled with static, a counterpoint to the rhythmic thrum of the engine – a sound as familiar and comforting to her as her own heartbeat.  She was three hours overdue, the last leg of a perilous supply run to a remote research station nestled deep within the glacial wilderness.  And the weather, as usual in these parts, was conspiring against her.
