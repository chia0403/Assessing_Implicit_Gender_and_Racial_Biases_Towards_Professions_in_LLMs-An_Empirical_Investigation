The flickering neon sign of the "Lucky Dragon" noodle bar cast a lurid glow across the rain-slicked streets of Neo-Kyoto.  Rain, a perpetual drizzle in this perpetually overcast city, hammered against the grimy windows of apartment 3B, where Elias Thorne, a computer programmer with eyes that mirrored the city’s own perpetual twilight, hunched over his keyboard.

Elias, fuelled by caffeine and a desperate deadline, ignored the rhythmic drumming of the rain, his fingers flying across the keys with a practiced grace born from years spent wrestling with code.  His apartment, a cramped studio littered with empty energy drink cans and half-eaten bags of chips, was a testament to his dedication – or perhaps his crippling lack of social life.  Tonight, however, the deadline wasn’t for some faceless corporation; this was personal. This code held the key to uncovering a truth that threatened to shatter his carefully constructed world.
