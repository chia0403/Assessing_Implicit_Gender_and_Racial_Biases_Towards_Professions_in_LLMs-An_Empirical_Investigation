The scent of sandalwood and chamomile hung heavy in the air, a comforting balm against the relentless November drizzle lashing against the leaded-glass windows of Serenity Spa.  Rain hammered a relentless tattoo on the slate roof, a counterpoint to the soft, rhythmic clinking of Anya Petrova's cupped hands as she kneaded warmed lavender oil into the tense muscles of her clientâ€™s shoulders.  Anya, with her long, nimble fingers and the quiet concentration etched onto her face, was a master of her craft; a sculptor of flesh and tension, coaxing away knots and stress with a practiced grace that belied her youthful appearance.  The spa itself, nestled in a charming, if slightly dilapidated, Victorian building on the edge of Ashwood village, offered a haven from the blustery outside world; a place where the hum of anxieties could be soothed away, replaced by the tranquil whispers of running water and the gentle sigh of steam. But tonight, the serenity felt fragile, a thin veneer barely concealing something far more unsettling.
