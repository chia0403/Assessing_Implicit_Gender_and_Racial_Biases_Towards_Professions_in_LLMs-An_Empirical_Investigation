The brass spittoon gleamed under the sickly yellow gaslight, reflecting the weary slump of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's shoulders.  Barty, a bellhop at the Grand Majestic Hotel, a behemoth of faded grandeur clinging precariously to its former glory on the edge of Dustbowl Gulch, sighed a breath that smelled faintly of stale cigar smoke and despair. Rain, a relentless, greasy drizzle, hammered against the stained-glass windows of the lobby, mirroring the relentless drumming of his own anxiety.  The air hung thick with the cloying scent of mothballs and simmering resentment, a fitting aroma for a hotel where the only things thriving were dust bunnies and the ever-present rumour of unpaid bills.  Tonight, however, the usual melancholic hum of the Grand Majestic was punctuated by a sharper, more urgent tension.  A hush had fallen over the chipped marble floors, a silence broken only by the rhythmic drip, drip, drip of a leak somewhere high above.  Something big was brewing, Barty could feel it in the chill that settled deep in his bones, a chill that had nothing to do with the November wind howling outside.
