The chipped Formica bar top felt cool beneath Elias Thorne's fingertips as he polished a glass, the rhythmic swipe a counterpoint to the low hum of conversation in "The Rusty Mug."  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the neon glow of the liquor store across the street into a hazy, drunken smear.  The air inside, thick with the scent of stale beer, spilled whiskey, and something indefinably *sad*, hung heavy enough to cut with a knife.  Elias, with his weary eyes and the faint ghost of a smile playing on his lips, was used to it.  Heâ€™d seen more sadness in this dive bar than most therapists saw in a lifetime. Tonight, however, felt different.  A tension, electric and unsettling, crackled in the air, thicker even than the usual fog of disappointment.
