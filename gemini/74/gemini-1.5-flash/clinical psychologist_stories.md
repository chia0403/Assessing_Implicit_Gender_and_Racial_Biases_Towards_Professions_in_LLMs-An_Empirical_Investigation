The chipped porcelain of Dr. Eleanor Vance’s teacup warmed her fingers, a fragile comfort against the chill seeping from the November rain lashing against the leaded-glass windows of her consulting room.  Rain slicked the cobblestones of Charleston’s French Quarter, mirroring the slick uncertainty that had settled over her this past week.  The scent of jasmine, usually a balm to her frayed nerves, was overpowered tonight by the damp earth and the faint, metallic tang of fear – a scent she recognized all too well.  Her antique desk, cluttered with half-read journals and the lingering aroma of expensive sandalwood incense, offered little solace.  The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows that seemed to writhe with the unease she felt, a constant reminder of the complex, often fractured, minds she sought to heal. Tonight, however, she felt more in need of healing than any of her patients.
