The salt spray stung Amelia Hawthorne's face as she hauled the last crate of oysters onto the deck of the *Sea Serpent*.  The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum sinking towards the turbulent Atlantic, cast long shadows across the bobbing fishing boats clustered in the harbor of Port Blossom, Maine.

Her small, weathered hands, permanently stained ochre from years of handling saffron and turmeric, ached with the effort, but her heart, usually a cheerful counterpoint to her tireless hands, felt leaden.  The *Sea Serpent*, a sturdy but aging vessel, was her lifeline, and its cargo – the very essence of Port Blossom's culinary soul – was her responsibility.  Tonight, however, the weight of those oysters felt heavier than usual, mirroring the burden settling in Amelia's chest.
