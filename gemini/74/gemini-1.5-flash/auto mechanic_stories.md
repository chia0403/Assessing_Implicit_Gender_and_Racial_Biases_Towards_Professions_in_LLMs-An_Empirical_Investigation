The greasy scent of motor oil clung to Amelia Hernandez like a second skin, a familiar perfume that mingled with the faint metallic tang of burnt coffee brewing in the back of her workshop.  Dawn bled a bruised purple across the sky, painting the corrugated iron roof of "Hernandez's Auto," her family's small, cluttered garage, in streaks of fading darkness.  Inside, the air hung thick with the hum of fluorescent lights and the rhythmic whir of a tire balancer, a counterpoint to the insistent chirping of crickets still clinging to the night.  Tools, gleaming and grimy, hung in organized chaos from pegboards, a testament to years of meticulous work and the occasional, unavoidable, explosion of frustrated wrench-throwing.  Amelia, her hands already stained black from wrestling with a recalcitrant engine block, wiped a smear of grease from her cheek with the back of her equally soiled hand, a small, satisfied smile playing on her lips.  Another day, another challenge.
