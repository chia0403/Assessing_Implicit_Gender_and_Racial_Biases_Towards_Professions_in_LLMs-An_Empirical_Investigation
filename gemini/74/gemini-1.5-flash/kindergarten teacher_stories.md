The chipped paint of Ms. Eleanor Vance's classroom smelled faintly of crayons and desperation.  It was a scent she’d grown accustomed to over her twenty-two years at Sunny Meadows Elementary, a scent that clung to the worn, floral-print carpet like a second skin.  Sunlight, fractured by the grimy windows, illuminated motes of dust dancing in the air, a miniature, chaotic ballet mirroring the frenetic energy about to erupt as twenty-five five-year-olds tumbled into the room.  Outside, the relentless California sun beat down on the playground, a stark contrast to the slightly cooler, perpetually cluttered haven Ms. Vance had painstakingly cultivated within her four walls.  Today, however, even her carefully arranged alphabet border felt slightly askew, mirroring the unsettling tremor of anxiety that had settled in her stomach.  It wasn't the usual pre-school jitters; this felt…different.
