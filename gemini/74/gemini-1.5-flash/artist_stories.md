The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face as he wrestled the stubborn easel into place, its legs sinking slightly into the yielding sand.  The wind, a raw, untamed beast from the north, howled a mournful symphony around him, whipping his already wind-tossed auburn hair into a frenzy.  Before him, the churning grey expanse of the North Sea met a bruised, violet sky, the whole scene a chaotic masterpiece of nature's own creation.  Elias, a landscape artist whose palette usually favoured the gentle hues of the Cotswolds, found himself strangely captivated by this brutal beauty, the canvas a stark white rectangle challenging the tempestuous drama unfolding before him.  He perched his battered beret on his head, securing it against the gale, and adjusted his paint-splattered smock, ready to capture the untamed spirit of the Yorkshire coast.
