The fluorescent lights of "Sweet Surrender" bakery hummed a monotonous tune, a stark counterpoint to the vibrant chaos swirling around Aurelia "Rella" Blackwood.  Rella, a woman whose life was as meticulously layered as her award-winning wedding cakes, surveyed the scene with a sigh that only just failed to ruffle the perfectly coiffed auburn curls escaping her baker's hat.  It was the Saturday before Valentine's Day, the bakery's busiest day of the year, and the air hung thick with the sugary scent of almond extract, impending deadlines, and a simmering tension that only a dozen stressed pastry chefs could generate.  Mountains of buttercream, shimmering like snowdrifts, guarded precarious stacks of half-finished cakes, each a miniature masterpiece demanding Rella's expert touch.  The clatter of whisks and the rhythmic thump of a mixer battled for dominance with the frantic whispers of frantic assistants.  Outside, the February wind howled a mournful tune, a stark contrast to the sweet, sugary battle raging within the walls of Sweet Surrender.
