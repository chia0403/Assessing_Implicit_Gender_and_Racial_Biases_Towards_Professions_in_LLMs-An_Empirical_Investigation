The sanctuary itself, nestled deep within the whispering pines of the Cascade Mountains, was a sprawling collection of rustic cabins, interconnected enclosures, and sprawling, snow-dusted fields.  Tonight, however, the usual peaceful serenity was shattered by the mournful howl of a lone coyote echoing from the distant hills, a sound that clawed at Amelia's already frayed nerves.  The impending blizzard promised to further complicate an already challenging evening.
