Rain lashed against the Art Deco windows of the Hotel Magnifique, blurring the already fading Parisian twilight into a shimmering, impressionistic canvas. Inside, the lobby glowed with the warm light of crystal chandeliers, casting dancing shadows on the plush velvet furniture and polished marble floors.  Genevieve Dubois, her name tag pinned neatly to her impeccably tailored navy uniform, adjusted the pearl earring nestled against her dark hair.  A sigh escaped her lips, not of weariness, but of anticipation.  This was the calm before the storm, that electric hum in the air before the nightly parade of guests – demanding, eccentric, charming, and occasionally infuriating – descended upon her concierge desk. Tonight, however, Genevieve had a feeling something out of the ordinary was about to check in.
