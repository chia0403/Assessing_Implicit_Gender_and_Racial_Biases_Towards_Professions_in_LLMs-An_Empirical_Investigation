The fluorescent lights of Mrs. Eleanor Vance's kindergarten classroom hummed a gentle, almost hypnotic tune, a stark contrast to the cacophony of tiny voices that usually filled the space.  But not today. Today, a thick blanket of quiet lay over the brightly colored room, broken only by the rhythmic *thwack-thwack-thwack* of Eleanor’s stapler as she affixed construction paper sunflowers to the bulletin board. Outside, the last embers of a spectacular sunset bled across the sky, painting the snow-dusted peaks of the Cascade Mountains in hues of rose and violet. It was the Friday before winter break at Maplewood Elementary, nestled in the heart of the sleepy, snow-globe town of Hollybrook, Oregon, and the air crackled with a peculiar stillness – the kind that precedes either a blizzard or a miracle.  Eleanor hoped for the former. Miracles, in her experience, tended to be messy.
