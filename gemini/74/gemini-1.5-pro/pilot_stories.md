The biting Alaskan wind whipped at Amelia "Ace" Petrova's parka as she secured the last tie-down on the Cessna 185's wing.  Denali, cloaked in a fresh layer of snow, loomed like a watchful giant in the distance, its peak kissed by the rose-gold hues of a sub-zero dawn.  Ace's breath plumed out in frosty puffs, disappearing quickly into the frigid air.  Around her, the small airstrip in Talkeetna, a jumble of frozen mud and gravel, was slowly coming to life.  The whine of a generator from the nearby hangar competed with the distant howl of a husky. This was Ace's domain â€“ a landscape of unforgiving beauty and unpredictable weather, where survival depended on skill, instinct, and a healthy dose of respect for the wild.  Today's flight, a supply run to a remote geological survey camp nestled deep in the Wrangell Mountains, promised to be particularly challenging.  The early morning radio chatter had already warned of worsening blizzard conditions moving in from the north.
