The scent, sharp and earthy, filled the small, cluttered workshop, a comforting aroma he'd known since he was a boy, barely tall enough to peer over his grandfather's workbench.

Winter was tightening its grip, and the first flakes of snow, fat and lazy, began to drift down, dusting the corrugated iron roof of Elias's workshop in a fine layer of white.  Silver Creek was a place forgotten by time, nestled deep in the San Juan Mountains, a collection of weathered log cabins and hardy souls eking out a living from the unforgiving landscape.  And Elias, with his steady hands and keen eye, was the man they all turned to when wood needed shaping, whether for a cradle or a coffin.
