The rusty squeak of the barber chair was as familiar to Elias Thorne as his own heartbeat.  It punctuated the hushed rhythm of Thorne’s Barber Shop, nestled between Mrs. O’Malley’s perpetually fragrant bakery and the dusty, forgotten storefront of what used to be Miller’s Haberdashery.  The year was 1947, and the sleepy town of Harmony Creek, nestled in the Appalachian foothills of North Carolina, was slowly thawing after a particularly harsh winter. Sunlight, pale but persistent, streamed through the shop's large front window, illuminating the swirling dust motes dancing above the worn, checkered linoleum floor. Elias, a man built like an oak tree with hands as steady as a surgeon's, adjusted the crisp white cloth around his next customer, a fidgety young boy with more freckles than sense, and the scent of bay rum and talcum powder hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma that spoke of tradition and small-town secrets.
