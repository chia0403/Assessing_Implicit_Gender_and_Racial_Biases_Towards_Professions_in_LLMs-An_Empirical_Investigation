The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of Nevada, whistling a lonely tune through the rusted barbed wire fence surrounding the KALI transmitter station.  Inside the prefabricated metal building, bathed in the warm glow of vacuum tubes and blinking LEDs, Elias Vance meticulously adjusted the tuning capacitor of a hulking Collins 20V-3 transmitter.  The air crackled with static, a symphony of distant lightning strikes and the faint whispers of far-off AM radio stations.  It was 3:17 am, and Elias, KALI's lone overnight technician, was the only living soul for miles, save for the occasional coyote howling at the unforgiving desert moon. The rhythmic hum of the transmitter, a constant presence in his life, was tonight punctuated by an unfamiliar, pulsing signal, something just on the edge of audibility, something... alien.
