The successful separation of conjoined twins.  A marvel, a triumph, yet the exhaustion clinging to him felt like lead in his veins. The el train rattled overhead, a metallic shriek against the rising wind, a stark contrast to the muted beeps and hushed whispers he'd grown accustomed to.  He pushed through the gathering crowd on the sidewalk, his thoughts already turning towards the demanding schedule that awaited him tomorrow.
