The biting wind whipped at Elias Thorne's thick wool cloak, stinging his exposed cheeks. He stamped his feet, the sound muffled by the fresh layer of snow blanketing the cobblestones. Above, the twin moons of Aethel cast an ethereal, lavender glow across the ramparts of Castle Blackwood, transforming the already imposing fortress into something out of a chilling fairytale.  Elias, Captain of the Night Watch, gripped his halberd tighter, the cold iron a stark contrast against his gloved hand. The silence of the early watch was unsettling, broken only by the occasional screech of a barn owl and the rhythmic clang of the bell tower marking the passing of another hour.  Tonight, something felt different. The air was thick with an almost palpable tension, a silent hum beneath the usual stillness of the night.  It prickled Elias's skin, an unwelcome premonition clinging to him like the frost clinging to the castle walls.  He knew, with a certainty that chilled him more than the wind, that tonight, the silence would break.
