The biting November wind whipped across the cracked asphalt of the OK Corral Auto Repair, stinging Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez's cheeks even through the layers of grease and grime clinging to her skin.  Fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune above her, barely cutting through the gloom of the early morning. The shop, nestled between a laundromat with perpetually flickering neon and a boarded-up pawn shop, wasn't much to look at.  Rusty tools hung haphazardly on the pegboard, mismatched tires were stacked precariously against one wall, and the air hung thick with the scent of motor oil, gasoline, and stale coffee.  Amy, her dark hair pulled back in a messy bun, crouched beside a cherry-red '67 Mustang, a wrench clutched in her hand.  The engine, disemboweled and spread across a tarp, looked more like a metallic jigsaw puzzle than the heart of a muscle car.  This wasn't just any repair job; this was Amy's chance to prove she could handle the big leagues, to finally step out of her father's shadow and make a name for herself in the cutthroat world of classic car restoration.
