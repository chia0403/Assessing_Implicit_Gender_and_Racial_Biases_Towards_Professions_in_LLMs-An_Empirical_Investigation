The chipped turquoise paint on the door of "Nail It!" matched Elara Rosalind Finch's current mood: a little worn down, a little faded around the edges, but still fundamentally vibrant.  The bell above the door jingled discordantly as Mrs. Henderson, a regular with a penchant for glitter and gossip, bustled in, the scent of lavender and mothballs clinging to her like a second skin.  Nail It! occupied a sliver of prime real estate nestled between a bustling bakery and a perpetually empty travel agency in the heart of Oakhaven, Illinois.  Sunlight streamed through the large front windows, illuminating swirling dust motes and the rows of neatly arranged nail polish bottles, each a tiny jewel-toned promise of transformation. Elara, perched on a rolling stool behind her workstation, forced a smile. It was a Thursday afternoon, the lull before the weekend rush, and the air hung thick with the quiet anticipation of pending appointments and the faint chemical tang of acetone.
