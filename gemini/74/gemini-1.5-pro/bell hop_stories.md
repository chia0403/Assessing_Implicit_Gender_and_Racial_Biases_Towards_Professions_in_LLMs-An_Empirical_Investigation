The revolving doors of the Grand Majestic Hotel whispered a constant sigh of warm, humid air into the opulent lobby.  Crystal chandeliers glittered like captured constellations, casting dancing light on the polished marble floors.  A cacophony of hushed conversations, the clinking of ice in crystal glasses, and the rhythmic click of Louis Vuitton heels on the pristine surface filled the air.  This was the domain of Elias Thorne, a bellhop of slight build and perpetually tired eyes.  He stood at his designated post near the imposing mahogany reception desk, his crisp navy uniform a stark contrast to the vibrant tapestry of wealthy patrons.  A name tag pinned to his lapel declared him simply, "Elias," but his full name, Elias Fitzwilliam Thorne, hinted at a lineage far removed from the gilded cage of the Grand Majestic.  The year was 1928, and the city, a simmering cauldron of jazz, prohibition, and whispered secrets, was New Orleans.
