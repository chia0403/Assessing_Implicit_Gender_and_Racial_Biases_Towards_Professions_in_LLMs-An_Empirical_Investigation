The biting November wind whipped at Elias Finch's thick tweed jacket as he surveyed his domain.  Wysteria Hall, a sprawling Victorian manor perched on a cliff overlooking the churning grey expanse of the North Sea, was his responsibility, every blade of grass, every rhododendron bush, every gnarled oak in its extensive gardens.  This morning, a layer of frost clung to the manicured lawns, transforming them into a shimmering expanse that crunched beneath Elias's heavy boots. The salt spray from the sea, carried on the relentless wind, stung his face, a familiar discomfort he'd grown accustomed to in his twenty years tending to Wysteria Hall's grounds. The air held the metallic tang of approaching winter, and the usual vibrant hues of the gardens had faded to muted browns and greys, punctuated only by the stubborn crimson berries clinging to the holly bushes near the wrought-iron gates.  A lone crow cawed from a skeletal branch of the ancient elm that stood sentinel at the edge of the cliff, a stark reminder of the solitude that often accompanied Elias in his work.  He pulled his worn leather gloves tighter around his hands and exhaled a puff of white breath into the frigid air, already sensing that this particular day would be different.
