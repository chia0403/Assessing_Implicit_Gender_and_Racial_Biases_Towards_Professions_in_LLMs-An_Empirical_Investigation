The biting wind whipped off the Puget Sound, rattling the oversized windows of the Bainbridge Island Physical Therapy clinic. Rain lashed against the glass, blurring the already fading daylight into a diffuse grey. Inside, the air hummed with the low thrum of a therapeutic ultrasound machine.  Eleanor Vance, PT, DPT, OCS,  sighed, rubbing the tension from her neck. The scent of antiseptic and liniment hung heavy in the air, a familiar but not entirely welcome perfume.  Her last patient of the day, a particularly grumpy retiree with a frozen shoulder, had finally departed, leaving Eleanor with a stack of paperwork and the gnawing feeling that something important was undone.  The clock ticked towards six, the rhythmic beat echoing the dull ache behind her eyes.  Beyond the clinic's warm glow, the ferry horn sounded its mournful call, a sound that usually brought Eleanor a sense of peace, but tonight only amplified the unsettling quiet.
