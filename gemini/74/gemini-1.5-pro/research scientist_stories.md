The biting Antarctic wind whipped at Dr. Evelyn Reed's parka, stinging her exposed cheeks despite the layers of thermal protection.  The perpetual twilight of early spring cast long, distorted shadows across the icy plains, making the research station, a cluster of prefabricated buildings huddled against a jagged ridge, seem even more isolated than usual.  Evelyn, her breath clouding the air, adjusted her goggles and surveyed the desolate landscape.  McMurdo Station, a bustling hub of scientific activity just a few weeks ago, was now a distant memory.  She was alone, save for the whirring of the automated weather station and the crunch of her boots on the frozen ground.  Evelyn had volunteered for this solitary posting â€“ three months studying the effects of climate change on the fragile Antarctic ecosystem.  Three months to collect data, to analyze samples, and to confront the chilling reality of a world on the brink.  But something else had drawn her to this desolate place, a mystery buried deep beneath the ice, a whisper from the past that promised to change everything she thought she knew about the planet, and about herself.
