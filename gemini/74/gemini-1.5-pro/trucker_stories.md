The biting wind whipped across the desolate expanse of the Bonneville Salt Flats, stinging Amelia "Amy" Reyes's face even through the thick glass of her Peterbilt's cab.  Her rig, a gleaming chrome and midnight blue beast nicknamed "The Wanderer," grumbled low in its throat as it ate up the miles of seemingly endless white.  The sun, a pale disc in the vast, iron-grey sky, cast long, distorted shadows that danced across the salt crust, making the landscape look both beautiful and eerily alien.  Amy squinted at the shimmering horizon, the radio crackling out a static-laden country ballad, the only sound besides the hum of the engine and the whine of the wind.  It was just past 5:00 am, the start of another long haul to Reno, Nevada, a city Amy knew only from the postcards she'd seen in dusty truck stop diners. This leg of the journey, crossing the salt flats, was always the loneliest, a place where the world seemed to shrink to the confines of her cab and the endless, unforgiving white stretched out before her like a blank page in the story of her life.
