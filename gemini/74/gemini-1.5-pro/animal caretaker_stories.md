The biting wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's auburn braid across her face as she trudged across the frozen mud of the wolf enclosure.  Pine boughs, heavy with snow, drooped low over the chain-link fence, casting long, skeletal shadows across the white expanse.  The Howling Pines Wolf Sanctuary, nestled deep in the Adirondack Mountains of upstate New York, was a place of stark beauty, especially in the heart of winter.  The air, crisp and clean, carried the scent of pine needles and the faint, musky tang of wolf.  Amy, bundled in a thick parka and insulated boots, tightened her grip on the bucket of raw venison she carried, her breath puffing out in white clouds.  It was feeding time for the sanctuaryâ€™s seven residents, a mix of rescued grey wolves and hybrids, each with their own distinct personality and history that Amy knew intimately.  The howl of the alpha female, a magnificent grey named Tala, echoed through the trees, a signal both of hunger and a territorial claim against the encroaching twilight.
