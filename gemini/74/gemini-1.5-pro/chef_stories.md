The clatter of aluminum stockpots and the pungent aroma of roasting garlic hung heavy in the air, a familiar symphony to Beatrice "Bea" Flores. The Galley, her tiny but fiercely independent restaurant nestled in the heart of Seattle's Pike Place Market, was waking up.  Dawn painted the cobbled alleyway outside a soft lavender, filtering through the grimy windowpanes and illuminating the stainless steel surfaces of Bea's cramped kitchen. Rain, a Seattle staple, pattered gently on the corrugated iron roof, a rhythmic counterpoint to the sizzle of chorizo on the stovetop. Bea, her dark hair pulled back in a messy bun, wiped a bead of sweat from her brow with the back of her flour-dusted hand. Today was paella day, and the Market would soon be teeming with hungry patrons eager for a taste of her Valencian grandmother's recipe. The pressure, as always, was on, but a small, determined smile played on Bea's lips. This was her kingdom, a kingdom built on passion, saffron, and a whole lot of grit.
