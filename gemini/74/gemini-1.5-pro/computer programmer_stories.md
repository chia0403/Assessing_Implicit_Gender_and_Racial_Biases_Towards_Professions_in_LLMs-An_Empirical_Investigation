Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Elias Thorne's apartment, blurring the Seattle skyline into a hazy wash of grey and neon.  The twenty-seventh floor offered a spectacular view, usually. Tonight, it only amplified Elias’s sense of isolation. Empty pizza boxes littered the coffee table, remnants of a three-day coding binge fueled by lukewarm caffeine and the desperate hope of meeting his deadline. Lines of code, glowing emerald green against the black screen of his monitor, swam before his tired eyes.  Elias, his dark hair a tangled mess atop his head, rubbed his aching temples.  He hadn’t slept properly in 72 hours and the pressure of launching "Chirp," the revolutionary social media platform he'd poured his soul into, was starting to crush him.  Two days. He had two days until the beta launch, and the core messaging functionality was still glitching intermittently, a digital phantom he couldn't seem to exorcise. The apartment, usually a minimalist haven of clean lines and muted colors, now felt like a prison cell, the silence broken only by the rhythmic drumming of the rain and the hum of his overworked computer.
