The insistent drumming of rain against the arched windowpane echoed the frantic rhythm in Elsie Amelia Cartwright's chest.  Outside, the London fog, usually a soft, romantic veil over the city, had thickened into a menacing, swirling shroud, swallowing the gaslights of Chancery Lane whole.  Inside, the air in Mr. Grimshaw's office was stale with the scent of old parchment and pipe tobacco, a smell Elsie usually found comforting, but tonight, it only added to the oppressive atmosphere.  Mr. Grimshaw, a solicitor of dubious reputation and even more dubious hygiene, was late, unusually late.  His appointments were meticulously scheduled, his life an intricate clockwork of meetings and deadlines, and this tardiness, coupled with the sinister whispers Elsie had overheard earlier in the day from his hushed phone conversations, had her nerves stretched taut as a piano wire.  The ornate grandfather clock in the corner chimed seven times, each chime like a hammer blow against the fragile quiet.  Elsie shivered, pulling her shawl tighter around her shoulders, a prickle of unease dancing on the back of her neck.  Something was wrong.  Terribly wrong.
