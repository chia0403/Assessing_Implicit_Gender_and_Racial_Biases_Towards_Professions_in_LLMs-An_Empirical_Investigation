The fluorescent lights of Mr. Theodore Finch's classroom hummed a monotonous B-flat, a stark contrast to the vibrant chaos of the mural splashed across the back wall. Depicting a stylized jungle teeming with impossibly coloured flora and fauna, it was a testament to his attempts to inject some life into Westview High.  Westview, nestled in the dreary expanse of the Ohio cornfields, was a town where ambition went to die, pickled in the brine of routine and fading dreams. It was the kind of place where the highlight of the week was the Friday night football game, and the most exciting news was the opening of a new Dollar General.  Theodore, however, clung stubbornly to the belief that even in Westview, the seeds of inspiration could blossom, even if it meant battling the apathy that hung thick in the air like the ever-present scent of fertilizer.  This Tuesday morning, however, even his usual optimism was starting to fray at the edges, thanks to the looming deadline for the end-of-semester exams and the distinct lack of engagement from his senior English class.
