The salt-laced wind whipped Aurelia Celeste Bouchard's auburn braid across her face as she surveyed the scene.  Her easel, precariously perched on the windswept cliff edge, vibrated with the gusts.

Aurelia adjusted her paint-stained smock, her fingers itching to capture the ephemeral beauty before the light shifted, the magic lost.
