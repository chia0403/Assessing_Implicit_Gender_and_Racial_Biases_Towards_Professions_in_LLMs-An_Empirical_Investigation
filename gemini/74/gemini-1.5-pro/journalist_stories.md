Rain lashed against the grimy windows of The Daily Clarion, mimicking the tempest brewing in Amelia Hayes’ stomach.  The flickering neon sign outside cast a sickly green glow across her cluttered desk, illuminating half-eaten takeout containers and stacks of precariously balanced newspapers.  It was 2:17 AM in the perpetually twilight heart of downtown Grimsborough, a city that clung to the banks of the Ohio River like a rusty barge refusing to sink. Amelia, her dark hair pulled back in a messy bun, chewed on the end of a pen, the blue ink staining her lower lip a bruised indigo.  The assignment sat in front of her, a single sheet of paper bearing the chillingly simple headline: "The Butcher of Grimsborough Strikes Again."  This was the third victim in as many months, and Amelia, the Clarion’s newest crime reporter,  knew this story was her chance to finally break free from the suffocating grip of obituaries and local council meetings.
