The relentless Miami sun beat down on Ocean Drive, turning the turquoise water into a shimmering mirage.  Salt spray hung heavy in the air, mingling with the scent of coconut sunscreen and the rhythmic thump of a bass drum emanating from Lummus Park.  It was 7:00 am, already sweltering, but the heat didn't deter the dedicated few gathered on the grassy verge.

Val, with her cascading black curls pulled back into a high ponytail,  adjusted her microphone headset and flashed a megawatt smile. Her toned arms, a testament to her own rigorous routine, glistened with sweat.  "Alright, Miami! Are we ready to sweat out those mojitos from last night?" she boomed, her voice energized despite the early hour.  The assembled group, a mix of tanned locals and bleary-eyed tourists, responded with a chorus of cheers and groans. This small patch of grass, bordered by palm trees and the endless expanse of the Atlantic, was Val's kingdom, and for the next hour, she was queen.
