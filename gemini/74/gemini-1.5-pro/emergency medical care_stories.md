The siren wailed, a mournful cry slicing through the humid Florida night.  Palm trees swayed rhythmically in the warm breeze, oblivious to the flashing lights that painted them alternating shades of red and blue. Inside the ambulance, Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez, a paramedic with Miami-Dade Fire Rescue, gripped the metal railing as they careened around a corner, the tires screaming in protest.  Sweat beaded on her forehead, not entirely from the stifling heat.  The dispatcher’s voice crackled over the radio, relaying fragmented details: a multi-vehicle collision on the MacArthur Causeway, multiple injuries, possible fatalities.  Amy’s stomach churned.  The neon glow of South Beach, usually a vibrant backdrop to her nightly runs, tonight felt like a lurid omen. The air in the ambulance crackled with a tense anticipation, a silent countdown to chaos.
