The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of frangipani and exhaust fumes.  A gecko chirped from a tangle of bougainvillea clinging to the crumbling ochre wall. Eliza Beatriz Hernandez adjusted the microphone clipped to her collar and plastered a bright, welcoming smile on her face.  The cobbled square of Plaza Mayor in Trinidad, Cuba, shimmered in the midday sun, its pastel-painted colonial buildings bleached almost white by the unrelenting Caribbean light.  Horses clopped lazily across the uneven stones, pulling carriages laden with tourists, their drivers hawking rides in rapid-fire Spanish. Eliza, however, was focused on her small group of eight, gathered under the shade of a giant ceiba tree. They clutched water bottles, cameras, and guidebooks, blinking against the glare, a mixture of apprehension and excitement on their faces.  This was the first stop on their "Hidden Gems of Cuba" tour, and Eliza, their guide for the next ten days, was determined to make it unforgettable.
