Northwood, a small town nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, lived and breathed high school football.  Soccer, especially girls' soccer, was an afterthought, relegated to the worn-out field behind the baseball diamond.  This year, the Ravens had managed a single, glorious win. One.  Amy jammed her hands deeper into her pockets, the chill seeping into her bones despite the multiple layers.  She needed to shake off this season, plan for the next.  But a persistent knot of unease tightened in her stomach. This year feltâ€¦different.  It wasn't just the losses. Something else was lurking beneath the surface, a shadow hanging over the team, and Amy couldn't quite put her finger on it.
