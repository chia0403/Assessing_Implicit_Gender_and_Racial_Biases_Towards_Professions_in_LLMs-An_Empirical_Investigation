The aroma of burnt sugar and coconut hung thick in the air, a testament to Mrs. Hendersonâ€™s weekly perm.  Eleanor Grace Cartwright, her fingers nimble despite the clinging sweetness, carefully unwound a curl from the pink plastic rod.  Her salon, "Shear Elegance," nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed fortune teller's on Magnolia Street, was a beacon of vibrant colour in the otherwise muted palette of Ashworth, a small seaside town where the fog rolled in as regularly as the tide. The salt air, though invigorating for the soul, was less kind to Eleanor's carefully arranged displays of hair products, leaving a perpetually sticky film on everything. This Tuesday morning was no exception. Outside, the foghorn moaned low and mournful, a sound that usually soothed Eleanor, but today only amplified the knot of anxiety tightening in her stomach.  Mrs. Henderson's perm was the least of her worries.
