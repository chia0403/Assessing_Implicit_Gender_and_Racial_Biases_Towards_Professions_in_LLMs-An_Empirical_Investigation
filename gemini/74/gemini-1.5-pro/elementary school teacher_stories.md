The late afternoon sun, filtered through the dusty Venetian blinds of Mrs. Eleanor Vance's third-grade classroom, cast long stripes across the worn linoleum floor.  Tiny, brightly colored handprints, remnants of a long-ago art project, dotted the window panes like confetti.  Room 3B at Maplewood Elementary, nestled in the heart of the sleepy, seaside town of Port Blossom, Oregon, was usually a hive of boisterous energy. Today, however, a strange quiet lingered, punctuated only by the rhythmic ticking of the clock above the chalkboard and the distant cries of gulls wheeling over the nearby Pacific.  Eleanor, her dark hair pulled back in a messy bun, sat at her desk, a half-graded stack of spelling tests forgotten beneath a worn copy of "Charlotte's Web."  A single, crumpled drawing lay before her â€“ a crayon depiction of a bright yellow sun with an unnervingly sad face.  Something was amiss, and Eleanor, with a growing sense of unease, couldn't shake the feeling it had something to do with the sudden, unexplained absence of eight-year-old Tommy Becker.
