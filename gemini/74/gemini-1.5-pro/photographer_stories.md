The biting wind whipped Amelia "Mia" Reyes's dark hair across her face as she adjusted the tripod on the precipice of Blackwind Bluff. Below, the churning grey expanse of the North Atlantic crashed against the jagged teeth of the Cornish coastline.  Spray kissed her cheeks, a salty reminder of the raw power she hoped to capture.  Mia, bundled in layers of wool and waterproof gear, hunched deeper into her parka, her gloved fingers fiddling with the settings on her battered Nikon D800. This was it. The perfect storm brewing, the light fading just so, the cliffs shrouded in an ethereal mist â€“ a photographer's dream.  She'd been chasing this shot for weeks, braving the fickle weather and the skeptical glances of the locals in the nearby fishing village of Portwenn. This shot, this perfect moment, was going to be her ticket out.  Away from the stifling predictability of wedding photography and into the world of National Geographic, into a life of adventure and untold stories.
