Rain lashed against the stained-glass windows of The Gilded Lily, blurring the neon glow of the "Open" sign into a shimmering halo.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of stale beer, cheap whiskey, and desperation.  Eliza Jane O'Malley, her auburn hair piled high atop her head in a precarious knot, polished the already gleaming mahogany bar top with a practiced hand.  The Lily, nestled between a pawn shop and a laundromat in the heart of downtown Providence, Rhode Island, wasn't much to look at, but it was Eliza's domain, and she ruled it with a mix of sharp wit and quiet compassion. This Tuesday night was slow, the usual crowd deterred by the downpour, leaving only a handful of regulars hunched over their drinks, lost in their own private storms.
