The fluorescent lights of the Discount Dreams mattress warehouse hummed a monotonous tune, punctuated by the occasional squeak of a testing customer. Rain lashed against the plate-glass windows, blurring the neon "Going Out of Business" sign into a smeary promise. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of new foam and the faint desperation of impending closure. Eleanor Vance, a woman whose smile could sell sand in the Sahara, adjusted the collar of her teal polo shirt and prepared for another day of convincing people they needed a king-size bed they couldn't afford.  Her name tag, pinned precariously to the stretched fabric, declared her "Sleep Specialist," a title she'd embraced with ironic enthusiasm since starting the job three weeks prior â€“ just long enough to realize the "Going Out of Business" sale was less a temporary event and more a slow, agonizing death rattle.  The store, a vast, echoing space on the outskirts of Bakersfield, California, was a graveyard of discounted dreams, piled high with mattresses in various stages of abandonment.  Eleanor, however, remained stubbornly optimistic, or at least appeared to be. After all, commission was commission, even if the apocalypse was looming in the form of a "Store Closing in 3 Days" banner hanging above the entrance.
