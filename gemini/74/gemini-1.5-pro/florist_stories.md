The bell above the door of "Petal & Plume" tinkled a melancholic two-note tune, the sound swallowed by the thick scent of lilies and damp earth.  Rain lashed against the large front window, blurring the view of the cobbled streets of Port Blossom, Oregon.  Inside, Amelia Iris Thorne, her hands stained green from stripping thorns off a bouquet of Black Baccara roses, sighed. November had arrived, draping the small coastal town in a perpetual twilight and bringing with it a quiet that settled heavier than the sea mist clinging to the cliffs.  It wasn't the lack of customers that bothered Amelia â€“ November was always slow.  It was the quiet whispers of the flowers themselves, a language she understood all too well, and they were murmuring of change, of something unsettling brewing on the wind.
