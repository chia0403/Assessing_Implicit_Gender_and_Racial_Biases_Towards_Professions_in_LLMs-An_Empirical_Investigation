Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Elias Thorne's office, blurring the already fading London skyline into a hazy watercolour.  The Shard, usually a piercing needle in the twilight, was now a smudged grey phantom.  Elias, fingers steepled beneath his chin, stared at the reflected image of his own tired face superimposed over the cityscape.  He was thirty-seven, with the kind of perpetually rumpled appearance that suggested he pulled all-nighters more often than he slept.  His office, perched on the 20th floor of a sleek, minimalist building in Shoreditch, was a testament to this dedication – blueprints were strewn across the polished concrete floor, scale models cluttered every surface, and the faint aroma of stale coffee hung heavy in the air.  Tonight, however, the usual hum of creative energy was absent.  Only the relentless drumming of the rain and the low thrum of the city below filled the silence, a soundtrack to Elias’s growing unease.  He’d received a call earlier that evening, a call that had chipped away at the carefully constructed walls he’d built around himself, a call about a house... a house he’d designed ten years ago and tried to forget.
