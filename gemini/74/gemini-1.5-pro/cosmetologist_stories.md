The flickering neon sign of "Shear Radiance" cast a lurid, almost radioactive glow on the rain-slicked streets of downtown Zenith, Ohio. Inside, amidst the chemical tang of perms and the hum of hair dryers, Genevieve "Gigi" Dupres sighed, wiping a stray strand of bleach-blonde hair from her cheek.  It was a Tuesday night in February, the kind of night that gnawed at the edges of optimism, leaving behind only a raw, damp chill. The only other person in the salon was Mrs. Periwinkle, a woman whose hair Gigi had been dyeing various shades of violet for the past twenty years.  Mrs. Periwinkle was currently wrapped in a plastic cape, humming along to a Muzak rendition of "Dancing Queen," oblivious to the creeping sense of unease that had settled over Gigi like a cheap hairnet.  Outside, the wind howled, rattling the salon's large front window, and Gigi couldn't shake the feeling that something was about to change, something big.
