The biting November wind whipped around Eleanor Vance's ankles as she climbed the steps of the grand, if slightly dilapidated, Victorian house.  Grey clouds scudded low across the sky, mirroring the slate roof above her, and threatening snow.  This was Oakhaven Manor, a residential care facility nestled in the heart of the sleepy, seaside town of Port Blossom, Maine.  Eleanor, bundled in a thick wool coat and scarf, pulled her leather satchel higher onto her shoulder. Today was her first day as the resident occupational therapist, and a knot of anticipation, tinged with a sliver of trepidation, tightened in her stomach. The air smelled of salt and decaying leaves â€“ a scent both melancholy and invigorating.  Through the multi-paned windows of the house, she could see a faint, warm glow, hinting at the lives contained within.  This was where she would help residents regain their independence, their purpose, their stories.  This was where Eleanor's own story, at Oakhaven, would begin.
