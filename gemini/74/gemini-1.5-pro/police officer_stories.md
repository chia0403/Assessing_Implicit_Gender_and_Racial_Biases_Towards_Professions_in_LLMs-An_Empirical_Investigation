A lone figure stood precariously close to the railing, silhouetted against the backdrop of the Manhattan skyline, a dark shape against a glittering canvas. Izzyâ€™s hand instinctively went to her radio, the cold metal a familiar comfort. This wasn't the first time she'd encountered this scene, and a deep knot of dread told her it wouldn't be the last.
