The tar hissed and bubbled, a miniature volcanic eruption on the sizzling shingles.  Elias Thorne, his face slick with sweat and grime, pressed down on the patch with his trowel, the heat radiating up through the thick soles of his boots.  The July sun beat down on the rooftop of the old Victorian, baking the slate tiles to a blistering temperature.  Below him, the small town of Havenwood, Maine, stretched out like a patchwork quilt: neat squares of lawn and garden interspersed with the weathered grey of shingle-sided houses and the occasional glint of the river snaking its way through the valley. The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of pine needles and the distant, salty tang of the sea.  Elias squinted, the dazzling reflection from the nearby church spire catching his eye. He'd been patching roofs in Havenwood for twenty years, knew every gable and chimney stack like the back of his calloused hand, but something felt different today. A prickling unease, like a loose shingle in a rising wind, tugged at the edge of his awareness.
