The recycled air hummed a monotonous lullaby, punctuated by the occasional clink of ice against plastic as Amelia Grace Hawthorne navigated the narrow aisle of the Boeing 777.  Outside, the inky canvas of the pre-dawn sky was beginning to bleed hues of bruised purple and hesitant orange, a subtle promise of sunrise somewhere far below. Flight AX23, London to Tokyo, was only half full, a blessing and a curse. A blessing because it meant less demand on Amelia’s already stretched patience after a delayed take-off and a crying baby in row 12.  A curse because the half-empty cabin amplified the eerie quiet, a stillness that felt heavy with unspoken anxieties.  This particular flight always seemed to attract an odd assortment of passengers, and tonight was no exception.  A man in a fedora two sizes too big hunched in 27A, muttering to himself.  A woman draped in a shimmering silver shawl stared intensely out the window in 14B, occasionally whispering to what Amelia could only assume was thin air.  And then there was the gentleman in 8C, his face obscured by a newspaper, who hadn’t moved a muscle since boarding. The air, already thick with recycled oxygen, seemed to crackle with a strange, unsettling energy.
