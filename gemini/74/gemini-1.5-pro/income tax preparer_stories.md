The stale air of Amelia Hallowell’s office tasted faintly of instant coffee and desperation.  Tax season was a beast, and Amelia, whose full name was Amelia Iris Hallowell, felt its hot, coffee-stained breath on the back of her neck. Outside, the April rain lashed against the window of her second-story office, blurring the neon glow of "Quick Tax Returns" across the slick pavement. Located in the heart of Millhaven, a once-thriving factory town slowly rusting away on the banks of the Ohio River, the office was sandwiched between a laundromat vibrating with the rhythm of broken dreams and a perpetually empty storefront that still bore a faded sign promising “Coming Soon: Gourmet Donuts.”  Amelia sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair from her face.  Her desk, a battlefield of receipts, W-2s, and half-eaten granola bars, reflected the chaos swirling inside her head.  This was her busiest time of year, but this year felt… different.  There was a tension in the air, a sense of foreboding clinging to the damp air drifting in beneath the poorly sealed window frame, as if the very town itself was holding its breath.
