The salt spray kissed Dr. Elias Thorne's face as he squinted against the pre-dawn gloom.  Port Blossom, Maine, wasn't known for its sunrises in November, but Elias had always found a certain desolate beauty in the way the grey sky met the churning steel-grey sea.  He stood on the creaking wooden planks of his porch, the scent of pine needles and damp earth heavy in the air, listening to the mournful cry of a distant gull. His house, a weathered two-story clapboard affair perched on a rocky bluff overlooking the harbor, had been in his family for generations. It had seen better days, much like the town itself, once a thriving fishing hub, now clinging precariously to the edge of economic oblivion. Elias, however, was determined to stay, just as stubbornly rooted as the gnarled pines that clung to the cliffs.  He took a deep breath of the briny air and turned to head inside, where the faint, antiseptic scent of his dental practice, nestled in the lower half of the house, awaited him.  Another day, another tooth to pull in Port Blossom.
