The insistent chirping of a lone cricket, somehow amplified in the pre-dawn stillness, was the only sound that dared interrupt Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s concentration.  Her small travel agency, "Hawthorne's Hideaways," nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed antique shop in the sleepy seaside town of Port Blossom, Maine, was usually bathed in the calming scent of saltwater and old paperbacks. But this morning, the air crackled with the scent of ozone and anticipation.  Amelia, her auburn braid draped over one shoulder, hunched over a stack of brochures depicting sun-drenched Tuscan villas, her brow furrowed in concentration. Outside, the sky was beginning to bleed from inky black to a bruised lavender, hinting at the sunrise that would soon paint the harbor in hues of rose and gold.  A cruise ship, the leviathan "Oceanic Dream," was due to dock in Port Blossom later that day, bringing with it a wave of potential clients – and Amelia desperately needed to land a few big bookings.  The cricket chirped again, and she absently swatted at the air, her mind already miles away, crafting bespoke itineraries for imaginary travelers.
