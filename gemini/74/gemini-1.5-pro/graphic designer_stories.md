The insistent London drizzle seemed to mirror the relentless tick of the clock above Amelia "Mia" Grace Holloway's desk.  Her studio, "Ink & Pixel," was tucked away in a cobbled mews just off Brick Lane, a vibrant artery pulsing with street art and the aroma of curry.  Usually, Mia found the creative chaos invigorating, a kaleidoscope of inspiration.  But tonight, the vibrant hues of the graffiti outside seemed to mock the stark white of her computer screen, reflecting the blankness in her own mind.  The deadline for the rebranding of "Brew & Bites," a trendy new chain of coffee shops, loomed like a guillotine.  Mia, normally a whirlwind of colour palettes and font selections, found herself paralysed, staring at the blinking cursor as if it held the answer to the universe.  The only other sound besides the rain was the low hum of the refrigerator in the corner, a constant reminder of the lukewarm, half-eaten Thai green curry she'd been neglecting for the past six hours.
