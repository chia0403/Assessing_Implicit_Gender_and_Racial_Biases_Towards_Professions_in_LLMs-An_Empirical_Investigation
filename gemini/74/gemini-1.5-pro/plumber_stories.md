The rusted tailpipe of Mrs. Higgins' '78 Ford Pinto coughed a plume of blue smoke directly into Archibald "Archie" Finch's face, a less than auspicious start to his Tuesday morning. Archie, nostrils stinging and wrench still clutched in his grease-stained hand, coughed in response, a rattling sound like loose pipes in a drafty basement.  He was knee-deep in the damp, clinging clay of Mrs. Higgins' front yard, trying to coax the ancient outdoor faucet back to life.  Above him, the late October sky over the small, perpetually overcast town of Dunsmuir, Oregon, promised rain, and the wind that whipped through the gaps in the dilapidated picket fence carried the scent of wet earth and decaying leaves.  Dunsmuir was a town where dreams went to rust, much like the plumbing Archie specialized in fixing.  And Archie, despite the grime perpetually under his fingernails, had a dream of his own, one that involved a lot less rust and a lot more sunshine.
