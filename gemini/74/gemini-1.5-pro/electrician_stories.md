The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorne's ankles as he perched precariously on the second rung of his aluminum ladder.  Above him, the flickering neon sign of the "Seafoam Diner" buzzed erratically, its turquoise glow a sickly yellow in the pre-dawn gloom.  Port Blossom, Maine, was a town that clung to the jagged coastline like a barnacle, its salt-laced air carrying the scent of pine and impending snow.  Elias, bundled in his thickest work jacket, pulled his knit cap lower over his ears and sighed, the plume of his breath momentarily obscuring the peeling paint of the diner's weathered facade.  This was his third call-out to the Seafoam this month, and he had a sinking feeling it wouldn't be his last.  The wiring in this place was older than he was, a tangled mess of frayed copper and wishful thinking.
