Rain lashed against the windows of "Kneadful Things," blurring the neon "Open" sign into a hazy smear of pink.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of lavender and eucalyptus, a stark contrast to the November chill clinging to the cobblestones outside.  Eleanor Vance, her fingers stained purple from kneading arnica balm, watched the downpour with a sigh. It was a slow Tuesday evening in Port Blossom, Oregon, the kind where the only sound louder than the rain was the rhythmic tick-tock of the antique grandfather clock in the corner. Eleanor, a massage therapist known for her intuitive touch and encyclopedic knowledge of pressure points, had expected a quiet night, but even she hadn't anticipated this level of deserted.  She was beginning to think she'd be closing up early when the bell above the door chimed, announcing a customer who looked as though they desperately needed some kneadful things indeed.
