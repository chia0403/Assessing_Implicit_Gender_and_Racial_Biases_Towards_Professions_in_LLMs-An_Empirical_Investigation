The usually vibrant emerald of her eyes was dulled with disappointment, her usually meticulously applied crimson lipstick smudged.  One rogue tear traced a path through her carefully crafted stage makeup, carrying with it a streak of black kohl. Tonight, even the magic of Greenwich Village, usually her muse, couldn't save her.
