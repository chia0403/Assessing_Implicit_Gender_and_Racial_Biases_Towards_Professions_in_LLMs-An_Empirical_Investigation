The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Eleanor Vance, stinging her cheeks and tugging at the loose strands of her auburn braid.  She clutched her worn leather satchel tighter, its contents – observation notes, assessment reports, and a half-eaten granola bar – rustling with each gust. Greystone Preparatory Academy loomed before her, a gothic monstrosity of dark stone and leaded glass windows, perched atop a windswept hill overlooking the churning Atlantic.  The roiling grey sea mirrored the turbulent emotions Eleanor knew swirled within the hallowed halls of this prestigious, yet troubled, institution.  This was her third year as the school psychologist, and despite the breathtaking coastal Maine setting, Greystone had a way of chilling her to the bone. This morning, however, the chill ran deeper than usual. A note sat on her desk, simply stating: "Come to the headmaster's office immediately. It's about Elias Thorne."
