The clatter of pans and the sizzle of butter were Emilia Rose Dubois's symphony.  The cramped galley kitchen of *The Salty Siren*, a perpetually rocking shrimp boat off the coast of Louisiana, was her concert hall. The air hung thick with the smell of frying onions, garlic, and the briny tang of the Gulf.  Sunlight, filtered through the greasy porthole window, painted a hazy square on the worn linoleum floor.  Emilia, sweat beading on her forehead despite the humming ceiling fan, flipped a perfect omelet with a practiced flick of the wrist. Outside, the early morning sun glinted off the turquoise water, promising another sweltering day on the Gulf.  The rhythmic chug of the engine and the cries of gulls overhead were the only accompaniment to Emilia's culinary performance, a performance she repeated three times a day for the boat's gruff but appreciative crew.
