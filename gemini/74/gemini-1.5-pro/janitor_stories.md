The flickering fluorescent lights of the St. Jude's Hospital basement buzzed like trapped insects, casting long, skeletal shadows across the concrete floor. It was 3:17 a.m., the quietest hour, and the perfect time for Elias Finch to begin his rounds. Elias, a man whose age was as indeterminate as the stains on his worn-out coveralls, pushed his squeaky janitorial cart down the echoing hallway. The air hung thick with the cloying scent of disinfectant, battling unsuccessfully against the underlying metallic tang that Elias had come to associate with this place â€“ the scent of sickness, of fear, and sometimes, of death. St. Jude's was a place of miracles, they said, but Elias saw mostly the messy aftermath, the evidence of what miracles couldn't fix. Tonight, however, something felt different. A low hum, almost imperceptible, vibrated through the floor, and a faint, sweet odor, like overripe peaches, mingled with the usual hospital smells. Elias gripped the handle of his mop, his knuckles white, and peered down the long, dimly lit corridor.
