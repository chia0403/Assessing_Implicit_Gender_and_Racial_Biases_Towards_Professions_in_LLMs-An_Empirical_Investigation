The biting wind whipped at Amelia "Millie" Reyes's neon orange parka, making the reflective stripes dance like deranged fireflies.  Dawn hadn't quite broken over the desolate stretch of Highway 17, a two-lane ribbon of asphalt snaking through the California coastal mountains. The air hung heavy with the scent of pine and damp earth, a stark contrast to the acrid smell of diesel that clung to Millie’s work boots.  Fifty feet below, the Pacific Ocean churned, a restless grey beast barely visible through the swirling mist. Millie, perched precariously on the edge of the highway, secured the traffic cones with a practiced flick of her wrist, her breath clouding the frosty air.  Today's job: patching a section of road undermined by the relentless winter rains.  It was thankless work, but Millie took a certain quiet pride in keeping this treacherous stretch of highway safe.  Little did she know that today’s job would be anything but routine.
