The aroma of burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the usual comforting scent of yeast and cinnamon that permeated Beatrice "Bea" LaRue's bakery.

"Le Petit Four," Bea’s pride and joy, nestled between a bustling fish market and a perpetually dusty antique shop on the cobbled streets of Port Blossom, had never seen such a disaster. Outside, the pre-dawn sky bled a soft peach colour, mirroring the hue of the now-ruined icing, while the salty tang of the nearby ocean breeze did little to alleviate the bitter taste of failure rising in Bea’s throat.  This was not how she’d envisioned her biggest commission to date.
