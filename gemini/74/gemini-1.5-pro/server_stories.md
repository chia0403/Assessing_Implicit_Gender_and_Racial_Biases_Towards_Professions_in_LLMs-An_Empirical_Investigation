The flickering neon sign of the Starlight Diner cast a greasy rainbow across the rain-slicked asphalt of Route 66. Inside, the air hung thick with the aroma of frying onions, stale coffee, and desperation.  Amelia "Amy" Rose Hawthorne, her nametag slightly askew on her faded pink uniform, leaned against the counter, idly tracing circles on the condensation-covered surface with a chipped mug.  It was 2:17 am on a Tuesday, the kind of desolate hour that stripped away the manufactured cheer of the diner, revealing its bare bones: cracked linoleum, wobbly stools, and the ghosts of countless truckers and weary travelers who had sought refuge within its brightly lit walls.  Outside, the wind howled like a hungry wolf, rattling the windows and promising more rain. Amy sighed, pushing a stray strand of her strawberry-blonde hair behind her ear.  Another slow night, another dwindling pot of tips.  She just hoped she'd make enough to cover the gas bill this month.
