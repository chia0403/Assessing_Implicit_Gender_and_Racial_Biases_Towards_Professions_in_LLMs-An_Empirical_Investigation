The clatter of horse-drawn carriages on cobblestones filtered through the dusty attic window, a rhythmic counterpoint to the whir of Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s treadle sewing machine.  It was a stifling July afternoon in 1888, the air thick and heavy in her tiny workroom tucked beneath the eaves of a crooked building on Grimshaw Lane, just a stone’s throw from the bustling Smithfield Market in London.  Rolls of silk and satin, stacked precariously against the sloping walls, shimmered in the slivers of sunlight that pierced the grime-streaked glass.  Pins and needles, scattered across the worn wooden worktable like fallen stars, glittered amongst the scraps of lace and velvet. Amelia, her auburn hair escaping its loose bun, hummed a tuneless melody as she meticulously stitched the final pearl onto the bodice of a magnificent emerald green gown, destined for Lady Beatrice Ashworth's summer ball.  The dress, a froth of shimmering silk and delicate lace, was her most ambitious creation yet, and its success or failure could very well determine the fate of her fledgling business.
