The fluorescent lights of the "Daily Grind" coffee shop hummed, a constant, low thrum that vibrated through Amelia Rose Hawthorneâ€™s worn-out, beige-and-grey uniform.  Every morning, the same ritual played out: the rhythmic clang of the espresso machine, the clatter of mugs, the insistent buzz of the intercom, the monotonous drone of customers ordering their lattes and cappuccinos.  Amelia, twenty-two, perched on the edge of her stool, the chipped ceramic cup in her hand feeling strangely heavy.  Outside, the city of Oakhaven thrummed with its own chaotic rhythm: the honking of horns, the distant sirens, the shouts of street vendors.  Inside the Daily Grind, however, a quiet, if sometimes frazzled, calm reigned.  For Amelia, it was a battlefield, a stage for the daily grind of her own quiet struggles.  Today, it promised to be no different.
