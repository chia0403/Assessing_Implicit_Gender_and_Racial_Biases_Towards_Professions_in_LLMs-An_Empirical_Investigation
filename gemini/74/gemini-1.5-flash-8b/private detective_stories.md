The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the dilapidated garage, a relentless percussion that mirrored the pounding in Amelia "Ace"  Ashworth's temples.  The flickering neon sign above – a faded silhouette of a magnifying glass – cast a sickly yellow glow on the grime-coated workbench, illuminating the half-empty coffee cup and the crumpled newspaper spread across it.  Ace,  a private investigator with a reputation as sharp as her wit and twice as cynical, stared at the faded photograph.  It depicted a young woman, her smile almost radiant despite the faded print.  This was the first clue in the case of the missing heiress,  Isabella "Izzy" Cavendish, and Ace felt the familiar chill of a case spiraling into something more sinister than a simple kidnapping.

The setting was the grimy underbelly of  Port Blossom, a coastal town clinging to the edge of the Pacific Northwest.  Rain-slicked streets, lined with dilapidated shops and boarded-up storefronts, gave way to narrow alleyways that smelled of salt and decaying seaweed.  The town's history, like the weathered buildings themselves, was steeped in secrets and whispered rumours, tales of hidden fortunes and shadowed figures.  The air, thick with the aroma of damp earth and the tang of the ocean, hung heavy with a sense of unease.  Above, the dark, brooding clouds promised more rain, and even the relentless pounding of the storm couldn't drown out the unsettling hum of the unknown that lay just beneath the surface of Port Blossom.
