The chipped paint of the "Scissors & Smiles" salon, a faded coral pink, seemed to hum with a quiet energy, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *snip snip* that echoed through the tiny space.  Sunlight, filtered through dusty Venetian blinds, illuminated dust motes dancing in the air, highlighting the swirling, vibrant colours of the hair products lined up on the shelves.  This was the domain of  Alistair "Al"  Featherstone, a hair cutter with hands as deft as they were calloused, and a heart as intricate as the intricate braids he sometimes crafted.  Al, with his perpetually tousled brown hair and eyes that held the wisdom of countless whispered secrets, was a fixture in the quiet, forgotten corner of Oakhaven.  The town itself was a melancholic tapestry woven with faded Victorian architecture and the persistent scent of damp earth, a place where time seemed to linger, carrying the echoes of long-ago laughter and whispered anxieties.  His salon, tucked away on a side street, was a haven, a temporary sanctuary where the anxieties of the town's inhabitants could be shed, just like the layers of their hair.
