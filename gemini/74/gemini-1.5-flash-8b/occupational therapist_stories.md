The chipped paint on the windowsill, a faded, dusty rose, reflected the muted light filtering through the grimy London sky.  Rain lashed against the single pane, mimicking the relentless drumming in Elara Nightingale’s head.  Rain-streaked streaks marred the already-tarnished wooden floorboards of the small, cluttered clinic.  Elara, Occupational Therapist, sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair back from her eyes.  The damp air hung heavy, thick with the scent of antiseptic and despair.  Today, as usual, the waiting room was populated by a silent, patient army of the city's underbelly. Each figure carried their own burdens, etched into their slumped postures and tired eyes.  A flickering fluorescent light cast long shadows that danced with the movements of the rain outside.  This particular Tuesday, a new face added itself to the growing roster of anxieties.  A young man, barely out of his teens, named Leo, sat hunched in the corner, a worn leather satchel resting on his lap. Elara’s gaze lingered, a flicker of concern replacing the weariness that had settled in her.  The quiet hum of the clinic’s machinery, the rhythmic drip-drip of a leaky faucet – these were the only sounds that broke the deafening silence.
