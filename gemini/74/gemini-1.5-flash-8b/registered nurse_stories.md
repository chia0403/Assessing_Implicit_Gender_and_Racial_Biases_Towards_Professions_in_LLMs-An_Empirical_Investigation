The fluorescent lights of the emergency room hummed, a monotonous drone that drowned out the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Amelia Harding's heart.  A heart that, right now, felt more like a drum solo in a frantic jazz club.  The sterile white walls seemed to press in, the antiseptic smell clinging to the air like a shroud.  Outside, the city roared, a chaotic symphony of sirens and car horns, a stark contrast to the quiet urgency within the room.  Amelia, a registered nurse with five years of experience at St. Judeâ€™s Hospital, felt the familiar knot tightening in her stomach.  This wasn't just another night; this was different.  Something about the air, the tension, the way the patients' faces reflected the fear in the room, made her pulse quicken.  She knew, deep down, that this was one of those nights.  The kind that stayed with you long after the last patient was discharged and the last gurney was wheeled out.
