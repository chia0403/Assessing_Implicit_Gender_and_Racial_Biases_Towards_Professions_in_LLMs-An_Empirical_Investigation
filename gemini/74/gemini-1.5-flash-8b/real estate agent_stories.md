Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the dilapidated office, mimicking the relentless drumming in Amelia "Em" Hawthorne's head.  The flickering fluorescent lights cast long, dancing shadows across the dusty, beige walls, highlighting the chipped paint and the general air of neglect that permeated the entire space.  This wasn't the gleaming, modern office she'd envisioned when she'd landed her first real estate gig in the vibrant, revitalizing district of Southport.  This was the "Southport Salvage" branch, a gritty, forgotten corner of a city that was rapidly reinventing itself, leaving this office – and Em – feeling like a relic. The year was 2024.

Southport, once a sleepy suburb with a handful of well-maintained Victorian homes, was now experiencing a furious burst of development.  Towering apartment buildings scraped the clouds, sleek condos replaced aging row houses, and the scent of fresh concrete and asphalt hung heavy in the air.  This rapid transformation was both exciting and terrifying for Em.  She loved the energy, the potential, the challenge of finding new homes in this ever-evolving cityscape. But this office, this "Southport Salvage" branch, felt like a mausoleum to a bygone era.  Em had inherited it, along with the dubious reputation and even more dubious inventory, from a retiring agent who'd vanished as mysteriously as the old houses he used to sell.  And Em, a fresh-faced graduate with a dream of success, was now stuck trying to find a buyer for a pile of peeling paint and crumbling dreams.
