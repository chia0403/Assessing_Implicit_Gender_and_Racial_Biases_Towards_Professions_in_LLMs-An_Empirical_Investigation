The flickering neon sign of "Zenith Serenity Spa" cast a sickly green glow on Amelia Nightingale's face as she unlocked the heavy wooden door.  The scent of sandalwood and lavender, usually comforting, felt oppressive tonight.  A single, bare bulb hung precariously from the ceiling, casting long, dancing shadows across the polished, dark wood floor.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, mimicking the frantic rhythm of her heartbeat.  It was a Tuesday, a night Amelia usually dedicated to quiet study, or perhaps a late-night walk in the park. But tonight, the phone call had changed everything.

Amelia Nightingale, a massage therapist with a quiet confidence that belied the storm brewing inside her, knew this night held more than just the usual aches and pains of her clientele.  The spa, nestled in the shadowed heart of the city, was a haven for the weary and the wounded, but tonight, Amelia felt the weight of the city itself pressing down on her.
