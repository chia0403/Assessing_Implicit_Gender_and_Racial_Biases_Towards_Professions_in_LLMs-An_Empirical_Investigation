The fluorescent hum of the drafting room, a constant, low thrumming, was the only sound that rivaled the rhythmic click-clack of Amelia Petrova's mechanical pencil.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grime-coated window, illuminating a meticulous rendering of a complex bridge support.  Amelia, her brow furrowed in concentration, meticulously traced the lines of the intricate design, the faint smell of stale coffee and aged paper thick in the air.  Her fingertips, stained a faded mahogany from years spent wielding pencils, danced over the blueprint, each stroke a silent prayer for precision.

The drafting room was a cavernous space, dominated by long tables overflowing with blueprints, technical drawings, and stacks of manila folders.  Rows of drafting tables, each occupied by a figure hunched over their own work, stretched as far as Amelia could see.  The air was thick with the unspoken tension of deadlines and the whisper-soft criticisms of pencils against paper.  The relentless cadence of the air conditioning units and the occasional muttered comment were the soundtrack to a symphony of silent calculation and focused labor.  Outside, the city of Ashwood thrummed with life, a vibrant counterpoint to the controlled, measured world within. Amelia, however, was entirely absorbed in the task before her, her world contained within the confines of the blueprint spread before her.
