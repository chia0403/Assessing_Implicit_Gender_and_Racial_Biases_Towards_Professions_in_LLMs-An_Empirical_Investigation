The fluorescent lights of the brokerage hummed, a relentless, almost hypnotic drone that mirrored the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Amelia Finch's heart.  Her palms, slick with sweat, were pressed against the cool, polished surface of her desk, the ticker tape whispering frantic messages of fluctuating fortunes.  Outside, the grey London sky mirrored the grey, churning anxiety that had settled in Amelia's stomach.  It was 3:17 pm, the hour the markets were supposed to calm, but today, they were a tempest.  A whispered rumor, first a murmur, then a roar, had swept through the trading floor, a phantom tremor in the delicate ecosystem of finance.  Shares of  GlobalTechCorp were plummeting, and Amelia, a junior stock broker with only two years under her belt, was caught in the crossfire.  Across the room, her mentor, the formidable Mr. Sterling, was barking orders into his phone, his face a mask of grim concentration.  Amelia felt a cold dread creeping up her spine, a sensation that was as familiar to her as the smell of stale coffee and desperation that clung to the air in this particular corner of the City.
