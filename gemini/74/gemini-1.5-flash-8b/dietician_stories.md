The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine and something subtly metallic, like old copper.  Dr. Eleanor Vance, a registered dietician with a perpetually tired but determined gaze, wiped a stray strand of dark hair from her forehead.  The bustling marketplace of Marrakech thrummed around her, a kaleidoscope of vibrant colours and intoxicating spices.  Stalls overflowing with apricots, figs, and exotic grains jostled for space beside vendors hawking intricately carved leather goods and vibrant textiles.  Her crisp, tailored linen tunic, a stark contrast to the swirling colours, felt oddly out of place.

Eleanor wasn't here for the sights or the smells, though she appreciated them. She was here for the people, the stories hidden within their faces, the subtle cues of nutrition woven into their daily lives.  This particular market, a labyrinth of narrow alleyways and hidden courtyards, was renowned for its unique ingredients and questionable dietary practices. Eleanor was part of a new research project focused on the dietary habits of Berber families, hoping to find ways to mitigate the rising rates of nutritional deficiencies and associated health problems.
