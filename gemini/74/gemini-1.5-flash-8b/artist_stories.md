The chipped porcelain doll, Amelia, stared blankly out the dusty window of the attic studio.  Sunlight, fractured and filtered through layers of grime-coated glass, painted fleeting patterns on the worn wooden floor.  Dust motes danced in the beams, like tiny, ethereal ballerinas.  This was the domain of Elara Nightingale, artist extraordinaire, or at least, that's what she told herself.  The reality was a little less glamorous, a little more… dusty.

The attic, perched atop the sprawling Blackwood Manor, was a symphony of forgotten things.  Boxes overflowed with sketches, watercolors faded to the colour of faded memories, and canvases lay propped against the crumbling walls, their paint-covered surfaces a testament to countless, unfulfilled dreams.  The air hung heavy with the scent of aged paper, linseed oil, and something else… something vaguely metallic, like old machinery and damp earth.  It was a place of both creative potential and suffocating stagnation.  Elara Nightingale, a young woman with eyes the colour of stormy seas and hair the shade of midnight, was its sole occupant.  The only sounds were the rustle of fabric and whispers of the wind whistling through the gaps in the roof.
