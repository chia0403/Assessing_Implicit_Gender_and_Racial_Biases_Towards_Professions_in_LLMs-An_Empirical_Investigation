Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the dilapidated clinic, a relentless percussion mirroring the storm brewing inside Dr. Eleanor Vance-Ashworth.  The air, thick with the scent of mildew and antiseptic, clung to her like a shroud.  It was a Tuesday in late October, and the skeletal branches of the ancient oak outside clawed at the overcast sky, their gnarled fingers reaching for the gloom.  Eleanor, a forensic psychologist with eyes the colour of storm clouds, surveyed the room.  Empty except for a chipped Formica table, a worn leather chair, and a single, almost-invisible smudge of dried blood on the linoleum floor. This was the quiet aftermath of another failed intervention, another life ripped apart by the insidious whispers of the mind.


The setting was the dilapidated, almost forgotten,  "Greystone Clinic" tucked away in the backstreets of Ashworth, a small, decaying town nestled between the sprawling metropolis of Newhaven and the untamed wilderness of the Blackwood Forest.  The once-grand Victorian structure, now leaning precariously, housed a grim history whispered about only in hushed tones among the townsfolk, tales of failed therapies, unsolved mysteries, and perhaps, something more sinister.  Eleanor, a native of Ashworth with a deeply personal connection to the town's unspoken past, felt its secrets pressing down on her, both a burden and a constant companion.
