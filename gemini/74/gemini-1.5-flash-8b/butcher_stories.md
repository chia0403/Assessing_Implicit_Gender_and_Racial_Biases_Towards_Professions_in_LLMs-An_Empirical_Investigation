The scent of blood, not the cloying, metallic tang of death, but the clean, sharp tang of freshly-cut muscle, hung thick in the air of Bartholomew "Barty" Blackwood's butcher shop.  Sunlight, fractured by the grime-coated windows, dappled the butcher block, illuminating the glistening surface of a recently-carved leg of lamb.  Dust motes, caught in the sliver of light, danced a silent ballet.  Barty, a man whose face was a roadmap of deep-set lines etched by years of handling raw meat and weathered by the unforgiving sun of the Scottish highlands, leaned over the counter, meticulously trimming a piece of venison.  He wore a stained apron, the deep scarlet of dried blood nearly blending with the dark, oily hue of the shop floor.

The small, cobbled street outside his shop,  "The Butcher's Block," was a symphony of bustling sound.  The rhythmic clinking of metal on metal from the blacksmith's forge across the way, the distant bellow of a cow, and the cries of children playing amongst the stalls of the marketplace vibrated through the very stones.  The aroma of roasting barley and frying onions mingled with the distinct, almost savoury smell of the damp earth. This was a small town nestled between the towering peaks of the Scottish highlands, a place where the rugged beauty of the land mirrored the resilience of its inhabitants.  Each stone of the ancient marketplace seemed to hold a story, each stall a miniature tapestry of rural life.
