The biting wind, a relentless harbinger of spring, whipped at Silas Blackwood's exposed skin.  He hunched deeper into his worn leather jacket, the coarse wool offering little respite against the icy blast.  Rain, a relentless curtain, plastered the slate shingles of the gothic manor to a slick, unforgiving surface.  Below, the sprawling estate, shrouded in a thick, unsettling mist, seemed to swallow the world around it.  Silas, a roofer with eyes the colour of storm clouds and hands hardened by years of battling the elements, focused on the intricate pattern of cracks spreading across the roofline.  Something wasn't right.  This wasn't just a routine repair.  This wasâ€¦  something else.

The setting: Blackwood Manor, a looming, centuries-old structure nestled deep within the mist-shrouded valley of the Whispering Woods.  Towering spires pierced the overcast sky, their jagged edges mirroring the unsettling creases in Silas' brow.  Twisted, ancient trees clawed at the sky, their gnarled branches like skeletal fingers, reaching out into the gloom.  The very air felt thick with an unspoken dread, a palpable sense of foreboding that had clung to the manor for generations.
