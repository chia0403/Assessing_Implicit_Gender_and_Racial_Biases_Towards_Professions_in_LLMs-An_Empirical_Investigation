The biting wind whipped Dr. Amelia Blackwood's crimson coat around her legs as she surveyed the desolate moorland.  Fog, thick as a shroud, clung to the skeletal remains of heather, obscuring the valley floor in a perpetual twilight.  The air, sharp with the metallic tang of damp earth and something vaguely… acrid, hung heavy in her lungs.  This wasn't the idyllic countryside she'd envisioned when accepting the position at Blackwood Manor Veterinary Clinic.  This was something… *else*.  

The manor itself, a looming, gothic structure of grey stone, seemed to press in on her, its shadowed windows like vacant eyes staring out across the bleak expanse.  Twisted oak trees, their branches like grasping claws, clawed at the sky, their silhouettes stark against the oppressive fog.  A lone, skeletal pine, its needles long since shed, stood sentinel on a nearby hill, a morbid landmark against the bleak, featureless landscape.  The only sound besides the mournful wind was the rhythmic drumming of her own heartbeat, a counterpoint to the ominous silence that pressed around her.  This was no ordinary case of a sick sheep or a fractured fawn.  This was something… unearthly.
