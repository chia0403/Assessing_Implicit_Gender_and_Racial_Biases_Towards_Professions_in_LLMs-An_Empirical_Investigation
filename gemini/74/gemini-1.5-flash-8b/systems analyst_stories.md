The fluorescent hum of the server room vibrated through Amelia Petrova's shoes, a constant, low thrumming that seemed to seep into her very bones.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light slicing through the gloom, illuminating rows upon rows of humming metal behemoths.  Amelia, a systems analyst at the sprawling, multinational conglomerate, GlobalCorp, adjusted the strap of her worn leather satchel, the familiar weight a comfort in this sterile, labyrinthine space. Tonight, however, the hum was different.  Louder. More insistent.  It wasn't just the servers; it felt…erratic.  Like a heartbeat gone wild.

Amelia, a petite woman with sharp eyes and a perpetually tired smile, pushed aside a tangled cable.  Her name badge, embossed with GlobalCorp's stylized logo, glittered under the harsh light.  She was known, within the hallowed halls of the IT department, as the one who could coax the most stubborn systems into compliance.  But tonight, something felt…wrong.  Not just broken.  Fundamentally, *unpredictable*.

The setting was the server room of GlobalCorp's headquarters in a nondescript high-rise overlooking the city skyline.  A vast, cavernous space, this subterranean chamber housed the very heart of the company's operations, a complex network of interconnected servers humming with data.  The air was thick with the smell of burnt circuits and anticipation, the latter a feeling entirely unfamiliar to this usually meticulous, methodically driven, systems analyst.
