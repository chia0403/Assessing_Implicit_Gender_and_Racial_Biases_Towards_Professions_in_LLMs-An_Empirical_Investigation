The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual, indeterminate grey, reflected the flickering neon sign of the "Grand Imperial Hotel" outside.  Rain hammered against the double-paned windows, a relentless percussion that echoed the frantic rhythm in  Elara  Alistair’s chest.  The year was 1928, and the Grand Imperial, a faded relic of a bygone era, held onto its grandeur with a tenacious grip, a grip that Elara, its resident concierge, now felt was threatening to crush her.  An unseen guest, a whisper of a name – Lord Ashworth –  weighed heavily on her mind, a phantom presence as tangible as the damp chill in the air.

The hotel itself was a labyrinth of polished mahogany and faded tapestries, a testament to a time when opulence was measured in layers of velvet and the scent of lilies.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom of the lobby, illuminating portraits of long-dead, impossibly elegant guests.  The grand staircase, once a spectacle of polished grandeur, now seemed to groan under the weight of its own history, its polished steps stained with decades of spilled drinks and whispered secrets.  The faintest scent of old roses and something vaguely medicinal hung in the air, a perfume that both comforted and unsettled Elara.  The hotel hummed with a subtle energy, a nervous symphony played out on worn carpets and creaking floorboards.  Elara felt its secrets, its anxieties, pressing down on her, and she knew, with a sinking heart, that Lord Ashworth's arrival would not bring peace, but only more disquiet.
