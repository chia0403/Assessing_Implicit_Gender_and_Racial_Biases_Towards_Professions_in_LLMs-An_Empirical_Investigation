The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks as she surveyed the sprawling, grey expanse of the Salisbury Plain.  A lone, skeletal hawthorn, its branches gnarled and twisted like ancient fingers, clung stubbornly to the barren earth.  Beneath a bruised sky, the wind howled a mournful tune, echoing the whispers of the prehistoric echoes Amelia was so passionate about sharing.  Today, she was guiding a group of ten curious tourists on a tour of the prehistoric wonders of southern England, a task usually filled with the cheerful chatter of excited visitors.  But today, something was off.  The air itself seemed to hold a palpable tension, a premonition of something unsettling lurking just beyond the surface of the ancient stones.  Amelia adjusted her worn leather satchel, the weight of her knowledge, and perhaps something more, settling heavy on her shoulders. The tour group, a gaggle of tourists clutching their cameras and bemoaning the cold, appeared oblivious to the shift in the atmosphere.  She needed to be sharp, alert, and more than ever, deeply observant.  This wasn't just another Salisbury Plain tour; something felt… different.


Amelia Blackwood, a woman in her late twenties with eyes the colour of stormy seas and a voice as captivating as the tales she told, held her position. This tour of the Stonehenge and surrounding area was slated to last three days, but this first day, centred on the plain itself, already felt… heavier.
