The flickering neon sign of "Ace Plumbing" cast a sickly yellow glow over the rain-slicked alley.  Water, a constant, unwelcome presence, dripped from the eaves and pooled in the uneven cobblestones.  This was the kind of night, Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, 28 years old, a master plumber with surprisingly delicate hands, preferred to avoid.  Not tonight, not with the rhythmic drumming of the storm against the boarded-up windows of the old Victorian building across the way.  A building notorious for its leaky pipes and unpredictable plumbing nightmares. Tonight, however, the call was different. A frantic, urgent call from Mrs. Eleanor Ainsworth, a renowned but eccentric antique dealer known for her fondness for elaborate, vintage faucets.  And Barty, despite his misgivings, was committed to getting to the bottom of every leak, no matter the circumstances.
