The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Smile Studio" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Elara Nightingale's workday.  Sunlight, weak and filtered through the grimy city window, cast long, distorted shadows across the sterile, yet somehow suffocating, examination rooms.  Dental floss and chewed-up napkins littered the stainless steel countertops, silent testament to the day's accumulated anxieties and whispered secrets.  Elara, a dental hygienist with a perpetually tired but determined gaze, adjusted the suction tubing, the rhythmic sucking sound punctuated by the rhythmic tapping of her fingers on the worn armrest of her chair.  Today, another routine cleaning. Another patient. Another story whispered between the scraping of instruments and the anxious breaths.
