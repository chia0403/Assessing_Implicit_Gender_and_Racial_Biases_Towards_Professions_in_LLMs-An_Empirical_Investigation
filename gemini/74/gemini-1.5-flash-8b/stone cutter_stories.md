The wind, a rasping whisper against the weathered stone faces of the quarry, carried the scent of pine and damp earth.  Dust motes danced in the pale morning light filtering through the jagged peaks of the Black Mountains, illuminating the rough-hewn pit where Elara Stonehand worked.  Stonehand, a name whispered with a mixture of respect and fear amongst the other quarrymen, was a woman carved from granite herself, her muscles rippling beneath the worn leather of her apron.  Her hands, calloused and stained a muted ochre, held a chipped mallet, its head gleaming faintly.  Around her, the air hummed with the rhythmic clang of hammer against stone, a symphony of labor echoing in the valley.  Today, the task was more than just shaping grey.  Today, a new commission awaited.  A commission that threatened to shatter the delicate balance of the valley, and potentially, Elaraâ€™s very soul.
