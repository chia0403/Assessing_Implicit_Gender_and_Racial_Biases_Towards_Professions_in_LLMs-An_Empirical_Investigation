Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the Maplewood High Guidance Center, a relentless drumming that mirrored the frantic rhythm of Amelia “Amy” Cartwright’s thoughts.  The fluorescent lights hummed, casting an anemic glow over the cluttered office, a landscape of half-finished forms, stacks of student files, and overflowing coffee cups.  Empty energy drink cans littered the small, chipped Formica table, silent witnesses to countless late nights spent navigating the labyrinthine emotions of teenagers.  Amy, a guidance counselor with weary eyes and perpetually smudged mascara, hunched over a thick manila folder, its contents a potent cocktail of anxiety, ambition, and unspoken fears.  The folder belonged to Leo Ramirez, a lanky sophomore wrestling with the weight of a family crisis and the pressure to excel in a world that felt increasingly hostile.  Outside, the storm raged, a fitting metaphor for the tempest brewing within the quiet walls of the small town of Maplewood.
