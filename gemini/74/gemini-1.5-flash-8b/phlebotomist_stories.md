The sterile white fluorescent hum of the lab was a constant, almost comforting, drone.  Amelia Nightingale, a phlebotomist with a surprisingly resonant laugh, found it less soothing than the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of her own heart against her ribs.  Today, the thump-thump-thump was accompanied by a particularly anxious fluttering, a feeling she recognized all too well.  It was Wednesday. Wednesday, the day of the quarterly blood drive, and Wednesday, the day she always felt a prickle of unease.

The lab, nestled in the sprawling medical complex on the edge of the city, was a monument to sterile order.  Rows of gleaming metal cabinets, each meticulously labelled with a different blood type, stretched as far as Amelia could see.  Brightly coloured antiseptic wipes hung neatly in their designated dispenser, their pale blue-green an ironic contrast to the deeper reds that, predictably, stained the walls.  The air hung thick with the faint scent of disinfectant and the faint, almost imperceptible, metallic tang of blood.  Outside, the city buzzed with life, a symphony of honking horns and distant sirens, a jarring counterpoint to the hushed calm of the lab.  Amelia sighed, pulling on a fresh pair of gloves.  The blood drive was about to begin.
