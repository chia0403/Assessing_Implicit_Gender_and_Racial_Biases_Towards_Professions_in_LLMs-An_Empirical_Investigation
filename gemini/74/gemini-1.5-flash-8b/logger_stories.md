The biting wind, a skeletal hand, clawed at Elias Blackwood's face as he crested the ridge.  Below, the valley stretched out like a bruised purple tapestry, the mist clinging to the ancient pines like a shroud.  Sunlight, a fickle friend, wrestled with the encroaching gloom, painting the forest floor in fractured shadows. Elias, a man carved from the same granite that formed the mountains surrounding him, pulled his worn leather cap lower, the brim shielding his tired eyes.  His breath, a ragged white cloud against the icy air, was the only sound that broke the profound silence of the early November morning.  He was a logger, and the valley, the jagged peaks, and the whispering woods were his domain, his world. His weathered hands, calloused and scarred, gripped the worn handle of his axe, a familiar weight in the stillness.  Today, the order was to clear a path through the old growth forest, a path that would bring progress, and inevitably, change. The forest, he knew, didn't understand progress. It only understood the relentless march of time.
