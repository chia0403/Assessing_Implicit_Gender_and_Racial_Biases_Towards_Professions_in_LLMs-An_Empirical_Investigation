The flickering neon sign of the "Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow on Elara Nightingale’s face, highlighting the weariness etched into her features.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless percussion against the already frayed nerves of the small town of Oakhaven.  Elara, a singer with a voice as smooth as polished obsidian and a stage presence that commanded attention, hunched over a chipped Formica table, the scent of stale coffee and desperation clinging to the air.

Oakhaven, nestled deep within the Appalachian foothills, was a town steeped in history, but more recently, in quiet resignation.  The coal mines, once the lifeblood of the community, were long gone, leaving behind hollowed-out hills and a sense of perpetual twilight.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom of the diner, illuminating the faded photographs on the wall – portraits of Oakhaven's heyday, of families laughing, of men and women working side-by-side in the mines. A stark contrast to the present, where the only sound besides the rain was the hushed whispers of the few patrons present.
