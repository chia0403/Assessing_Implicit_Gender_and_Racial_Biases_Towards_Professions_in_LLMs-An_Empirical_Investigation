The fluorescent lights of the "Apex Legal" office hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia Nightingale's life.  Her beige cardigan, a perpetual companion, felt like a second skin against the cool steel of the reception desk.  Ten years.  Ten years she'd greeted the same weary-eyed clients, listened to the same hushed whispers of legal battles, and processed the same endless stream of paperwork.  Ten years of beige, and ten years of the faint scent of stale coffee clinging to the air, a silent testament to the relentless rhythm of the office.

The office, itself, was a testament to muted tones and sterile precision.  Rows of identical beige cubicles stretched into the distance, a sea of quiet productivity.  Sunlight, a rare visitor, struggled to pierce the grime-coated windows, casting an ashen glow over the meticulously arranged files and overflowing inboxes.  The air conditioning, a constant hum, battled with the faint, metallic tang of fear and desperation emanating from the hushed conversations in the outer office, conversations Amelia had learned to interpret without needing to hear each word.  Today, however, a new scent had mingled with the usual aroma: something floral and almost sickeningly sweet, clinging to the air just a little too tightly.
