The wind howled a mournful dirge across the vast, ochre expanse of the Montana plains, whipping dust devils into swirling dances across the parched earth.  Sunlight, filtered through a bruised sky the color of a bruised plum, cast long, skeletal shadows that stretched and writhed with the wind.  Dust, fine as powdered sugar, coated everything: the weathered, weathered, corrugated iron roof of the ranch house, the flanks of the ancient, scarred Hereford bull, even the thick, braided hair of  Jeremiah "Jed" Blackwood, a rancher who'd seen more seasons than he cared to remember.

Jed, a man carved from the same granite as the mountains that framed the horizon, surveyed his land.  Not with the detached, analytical eye of a businessman, but with the deep-seated, instinctive knowledge of a man who'd lived and breathed this land for half a century.  The drought had been relentless, the crops withered, the water table sinking lower with each passing day.  The future, like the horizon, felt impossibly far away, impossibly bleak.  Every creak of the aging barn, every rustle of the dead grass beneath his worn boots, was a whisper of the past, a haunting reminder of what had once been.
