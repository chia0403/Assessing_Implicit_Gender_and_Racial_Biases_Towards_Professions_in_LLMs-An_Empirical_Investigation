The biting wind whipped through the skeletal frame of the unfinished skyscraper, stinging Elias Thorne's exposed cheeks.  Dust, the colour of faded ochre, swirled around his boots, clinging to the frayed edges of his work pants.  He hunched deeper into his thermal jacket, his breath misting in the frigid air.  Below, the city of Veridia, a sprawling metropolis of gleaming towers and shadowed alleys, stretched out like a tapestry woven from steel and glass.  He was a tiny, insignificant speck against the immensity of it all, perched precariously on the 27th floor, a single, flickering spotlight casting an eerie glow on the jagged edges of the concrete.

It was a Tuesday in late November, the kind of day that made even seasoned construction workers like Elias wish for a warm cup of cocoa and the comforting familiarity of a roaring fireplace.  The project, the Zenith Tower, was notorious in the industry â€“ plagued by delays, budget overruns, and whispers of structural instability.  Elias, a rough-hewn man with calloused hands and eyes that held the weariness of a thousand sunrises and sunsets on construction sites, was the lead foreman on the reinforcing team.  He'd poured his life into this project, much like he'd poured countless hours into securing his position within the construction hierarchy, and he wasn't about to let it crumble around him.
