St. Ives, with its rich history whispering from every cranny, was a canvas waiting to be painted, a challenge for any interior decorator, especially one with Amelia's meticulous eye and passionate soul.  The scent of sea air, mingled with the earthy aroma of the nearby market, hung heavy in the air, promising both respite and inspiration.  Her worn leather satchel, plump with sketches and swatches, felt reassuringly familiar against her arm.
