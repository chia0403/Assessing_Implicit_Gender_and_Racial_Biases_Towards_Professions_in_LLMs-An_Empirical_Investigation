The biting wind howled a mournful dirge through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks that framed the village of Oakhaven.  Rain lashed against the leaded glass of the workshop, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic rhythm of Elias Blackwood's hammer against the workbench.  Elias, a carpenter of considerable renown in the valley, was renowned less for the beauty of his intricate carvings than for the stubborn resolve he brought to every project.  He was a man weathered by the harsh seasons, his face a roadmap of lines etched by years of toil and the relentless scrutiny of the mountain peaks.  Tonight, however, the storm seemed to amplify a particular unease within him.  Dust motes danced in the scant shaft of moonlight that pierced the gloom, illuminating splinters of wood, tools scattered like fallen soldiers, and the lingering scent of pine and linseed oil.  Elias Blackwood felt the weight of a looming task pressing down on him, heavier than any beam of seasoned oak he'd ever crafted. The village blacksmith, Bartholomew, a man whose beard rivaled the length of Elias's arms, stood nervously at the workshop entrance, a chipped mug in his hand.  He was waiting for Elias to finish.  The storm threatened to obliterate the delicate peace of Oakhaven.
