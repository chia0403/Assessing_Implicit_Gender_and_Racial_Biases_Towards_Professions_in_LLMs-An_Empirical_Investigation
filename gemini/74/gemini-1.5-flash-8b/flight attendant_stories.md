The fluorescent lights of the SkyHigh Airways cabin hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic thrum of the engines.  Rain lashed against the panoramic windows, blurring the already-muted cityscape into a swirling grey.  Amelia "Amy"  Charleston, a flight attendant with SkyHigh for the past three years, adjusted her uniform – a pristine sky-blue blazer, perfectly pressed, a little tighter now than when she’d boarded in Chicago.  She smoothed the crisp white shirt beneath, a silent prayer for a calm flight.  

The plane, designated Flight 747, was heading from Chicago's O'Hare to London's Heathrow.  A typical, uneventful journey for a vast majority of passengers. But Amy knew, with a sinking feeling in her stomach that had nothing to do with the turbulence of the storm outside, that this one was different.  The cabin crew was unusually quiet, a palpable tension hanging in the air, thick as the London fog she knew they'd be flying into.  There was an unnerving absence of chatter, the usual pre-flight greetings replaced by a subdued murmur.  And Amy, despite her years of experience, found herself acutely aware of every shadow, every subtle shift in the cabin's ambiance. This flight, she sensed, held an unsettling secret.
