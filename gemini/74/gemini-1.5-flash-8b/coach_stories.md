The biting wind whipped Amelia "Storm" Stone's crimson scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks.  The icy grip of January clung to the sprawling expanse of the Glacier Peaks, mirroring the relentless pressure building inside her.  Above, the jagged peaks of the mountain range, sharp and unforgiving, cast long, skeletal shadows across the frozen lake.

Amelia, a seasoned coach for the elite Glacier Hawks ski team, stared at the figure huddled beneath the shelter of a weathered rock face, her heart a trapped bird beating a frantic rhythm against her ribs.  It was the only place the new recruit, Elara "Ice" Frost, dared to seek solitude.  The girl had arrived a week ago, promising a potent storm of skill and talent, but also a blizzard of defiance and self-doubt.  Now, the wind howled a mournful song, mirroring the turmoil brewing within Elara.  Amelia knew the delicate dance she had to tread â€“ the fine line between pushing her to the edge of her capabilities and breaking her spirit. Tonight, it was all or nothing.
