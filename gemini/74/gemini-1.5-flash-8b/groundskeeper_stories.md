The chipped paint on the wrought-iron gates of Blackwood Manor, a testament to countless storms and forgotten seasons, scraped against the rusted hinges as Elias Thorne, groundskeeper, pushed them open.  Dust motes, like tiny, ethereal butterflies, danced in the pale sunlight filtering through the skeletal branches of ancient oaks.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, held the whisper of secrets, secrets older than the manor itself.  Elias, his worn leather gloves already dusted with the grey-green patina of the overgrown lawns, adjusted the worn strap of his satchel.  This was the twenty-seventh time this month he’d been summoned to the manor.  The family, the Blackwood family, were notorious for their eccentricities, their demands, and their infuriatingly cryptic notes left tucked beneath the topiary hedges.  Today’s note, scrawled in a spidery hand on faded parchment, simply read: "The Whispering Willows await."
