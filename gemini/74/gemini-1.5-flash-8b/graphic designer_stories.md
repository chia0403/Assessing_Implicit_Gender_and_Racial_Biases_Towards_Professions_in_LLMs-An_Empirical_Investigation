The chipped Formica countertop, stained a sickly yellow-green from years of spilled coffee and lukewarm tea, reflected the harsh fluorescent glow of the studio.  Amelia "Em"  Ashworth, a graphic designer with a penchant for vintage typefaces and a perpetually rumpled cardigan, stared at the open laptop screen.  The vibrant, almost hallucinatory colours of the client's latest logo project clashed with her sense of calm, predictable order.  "A kaleidoscope of chaos," she muttered, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear.

The studio, nestled in a forgotten corner of the city, was a testament to Em’s resourceful spirit.  Tiny, repurposed windows let in just enough light to illuminate the clutter.  Stacks of discarded sketchbooks, half-eaten bags of questionable snacks, and overflowing bins of recycled paper overflowed the narrow space. A lone, sun-bleached poster of the 1970s band, The Crimson Tide, hung crookedly on the back wall, a defiant splash of colour in the muted palette.  The air hung thick with the smell of burnt coffee and lingering ink.  This wasn't the sterile, polished world of corporate design firms. This was Em’s sanctuary, her battlefield, her canvas.  Today, it was a battlefield of clashing colours.
