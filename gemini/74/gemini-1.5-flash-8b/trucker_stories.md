The fluorescent hum of the highway rest stop vibrated through Amelia “May” Butterfield's worn leather boots.  The air, thick with the smell of stale coffee and diesel exhaust, clung to her like a second skin.  May, 42, with eyes the colour of a stormy sea and a shock of unruly auburn hair perpetually escaping its bandana restraints, stared out at the endless expanse of asphalt stretching to the horizon, a ribbon of black against a bruised twilight sky.  The year was 2042, and the shimmering, faded interstate signs promised a destination that held as much mystery as danger.

May's rig, the "Ironheart," a modified 18-wheeler customized with solar panels and a silent, electric-powered chassis, wasn't just a truck; it was her sanctuary, her mobile office, and her refuge from a world rapidly changing and increasingly unpredictable.  This rest stop, a forgotten relic of a bygone era, was a temporary haven.  Outside, the once-familiar rumble of the highways, a rhythmic pulse of human activity, was drowned out by the distant, guttural growls of something…else.  The whispers, too, had started again.


Setting: A deserted, barely functioning highway rest stop along a major interstate in a semi-rural part of the American Midwest.  The area is marked by signs of slow but steady degradation, a subtle, almost creeping decay that matches the unsettling undercurrents of a post-apocalyptic world struggling to regain its footing, one that isn't quite the end, but more of a "what now?" period.   The lingering scent of a past, and the presence of something unseen, adds a layer of unsettling dread.
