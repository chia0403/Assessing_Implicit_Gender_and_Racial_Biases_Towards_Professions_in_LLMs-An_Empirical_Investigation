The fluorescent hum of the physiotherapy clinic, a low thrumming soundtrack to Amelia Hawthorne's daily routine, vibrated through the polished linoleum floor.  Sunlight, filtered through the grimy windows of the aging building, cast long, wavering shadows across the brightly-coloured exercise mats and stacked physiotherapy equipment.  Amelia, a physical therapist with a meticulously organised mind and a heart that often felt a little too full, adjusted the straps of a patient's knee brace, her fingers tracing the contours of the prosthetic.  Rain lashed against the windows, a relentless counterpoint to the rhythmic squeak of the hospital's machinery.  Today's patient, a young woman named Maya, was visibly anxious, her brow furrowed with a tension Amelia recognised all too well.  The air in the small, overcrowded clinic hung heavy with the scent of antiseptic and fear.  The clinic itself was nestled in the heart of a densely populated, working-class neighbourhood,  its fa√ßade a pale beige that looked almost swallowed by the brick and mortar of the surrounding buildings.
