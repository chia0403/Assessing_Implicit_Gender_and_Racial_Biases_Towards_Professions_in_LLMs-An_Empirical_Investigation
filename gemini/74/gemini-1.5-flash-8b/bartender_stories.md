The flickering neon sign of the "Rusty Mug" cast an oily sheen across the chipped Formica counter, reflecting Amelia Blackwood's tired eyes.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless percussion against the low hum of conversation and clinking glasses.  The air, thick with the scent of stale beer and cheap perfume, hung heavy in the small, smoky bar.  Amelia, a woman carved from years of late nights and early mornings, wiped down a sticky glass with practiced ease.  The bar, tucked away on a side street in the decaying heart of Port Blackwood, was a sanctuary for the city's weary soulsâ€”a place where whispered secrets and forgotten sorrows mingled with the rhythmic clinking of ice in glasses.  It was a place Amelia understood, a place where every face held a story, every drink a silent plea.
