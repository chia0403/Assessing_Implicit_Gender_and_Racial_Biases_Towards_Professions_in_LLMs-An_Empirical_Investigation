The chipped paint on the walls of Mrs. Amelia Blackwood's classroom at Oakhaven Elementary hummed with a low, almost imperceptible vibration.  It wasn't a tremor of the earth, nor the rumble of a passing truck.  It was a subtle, persistent thrum, like a hidden heartbeat, resonating from the antique, oak-paneled bookshelves lining the back wall.  Amelia, a woman whose auburn hair was usually a riotous cascade, had it pulled back tightly into a severe bun, her usual, bright smile replaced by a worried furrow in her brow.  This wasn't a normal Tuesday morning.  

The classroom itself, while charmingly old-fashioned, felt claustrophobic today.  Sunlight, usually a welcome flood, was blocked by a thick layer of grey fog that clung to the small, quiet town of Oakhaven like a shroud.  Outside, the normally boisterous playground was silent, a tableau of motionless swings and slides.  The air was thick with the scent of pine needles and something else, something subtly metallic, that prickled Amelia's nostrils.  Every object, from the worn alphabet chart to the faded crayon drawings on the bulletin board, seemed to hold its breath, expectant and unnerving.  Amelia, ever the watchful guardian of her charges, felt a prickle of unease.  It was a feeling she couldn't quite place, yet it hung heavy in the air, as tangible as the fog itself.
