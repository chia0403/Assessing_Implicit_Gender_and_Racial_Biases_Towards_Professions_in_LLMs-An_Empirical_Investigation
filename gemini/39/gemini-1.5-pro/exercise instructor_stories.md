The humid Miami air hung thick and heavy, even at 6:00 am.  Dew clung to the vibrant bougainvillea cascading over the wrought-iron fence of the exclusive Villa Azul condominium complex, its blossoms a riot of magenta and orange against the pastel stucco walls.  A rhythmic pulse of electronic dance music throbbed through the open-air pavilion overlooking Biscayne Bay.  Elena Sofia Ramirez, clad in a neon pink sports bra and matching leggings, bounced on the balls of her feet, her headset microphone secured around her jaw.  A blinding white smile split her tanned face as she surveyed the twenty-odd residents, a mix of retirees and affluent young professionals, beginning to gather on their yoga mats. The rising sun, a hazy orange orb peeking above the horizon, cast long shadows across the manicured lawn, promising another sweltering Florida day.  Elena took a deep breath, the salty tang of the ocean filling her lungs, and prepared to unleash her signature blend of high-energy Zumba and motivational mantras.
