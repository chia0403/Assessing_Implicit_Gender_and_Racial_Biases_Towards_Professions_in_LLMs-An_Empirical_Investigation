The flickering fluorescent lights of the Zenith Bio-Research building hummed a lonely tune, their pale glow reflecting off the polished linoleum floors. It was 3:17 am, a time when the bustling labs and offices stood silent and empty, save for Elias Thorne, the night janitor. Elias, a man whose age was as indeterminate as the stains he scrubbed, pushed his cleaning cart down the deserted hallway of Wing C, the faint squeak of its wheels the only sound other than the hum and the rhythmic swoosh of the mop against the floor.  Outside, a thin drizzle slicked the streets of Baltimore, mirroring the sheen of the freshly mopped corridor. The air hung heavy with the antiseptic tang peculiar to Zenith, a scent Elias had long since ceased to notice. Tonight, however, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced on his skin, a feeling he couldn't quite place, like a forgotten word on the tip of his tongue.
