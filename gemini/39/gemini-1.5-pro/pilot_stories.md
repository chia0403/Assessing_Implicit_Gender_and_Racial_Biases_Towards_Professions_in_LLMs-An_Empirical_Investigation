The biting wind whipped at Amelia "Ace" Reyes's flight suit as she prepped the Cessna Skywagon 185 for takeoff. Dawn painted the Alaskan wilderness in hues of lavender and rose, a stark contrast to the steel-grey clouds gathering ominously over the Denali range.  Talkeetna, a small, rugged town nestled at the confluence of three rivers, slumbered beneath a thin blanket of fresh snow. The air crackled with the promise of both adventure and peril, a familiar feeling for Ace, whose life revolved around navigating the treacherous Alaskan backcountry.  This particular morning, however, felt different. A knot of unease tightened in her stomach, a premonition she couldn't shake as she ran through her pre-flight checks.  Her cargo this time wasn't the usual supplies or tourists; it was a cryptic message, hand-delivered the previous night, urging her to reach a remote cabin deep in the Alaskan interior before nightfall.
