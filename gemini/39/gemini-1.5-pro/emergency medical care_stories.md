The siren shrieked, a two-toned wail slicing through the humid Florida night.  Rain lashed against the windshield of the ambulance, blurring the already hazy neon glow of the strip malls lining US 1. Inside, paramedic Amelia Reyes, her name stitched in crisp white letters above her left breast pocket, gripped the handrail as the vehicle lurched violently, swerving around a stalled-out pickup truck. The radio crackled to life, dispatch relaying a revised location for their call â€“ a suspected overdose in a dilapidated motel on the outskirts of Daytona Beach, the kind of place that advertised hourly rates and had bars on the windows. Amelia adjusted the strap of her bag, the scent of antiseptic and stale coffee clinging to her uniform.  The air hung thick with anticipation, a familiar weight settling in her stomach.  Another night, another life teetering on the edge. The motel, a faded turquoise box with a flickering vacancy sign, loomed in the distance, a beacon of desperation in the pouring rain.
