The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne's auburn braid across her face as she hurried across the deserted parking lot of St. Jude's Memorial Hospital. The sodium vapor lamps cast long, skeletal shadows, transforming the familiar rows of cars into hulking beasts.  Above, a sliver of a moon hung like a chipped porcelain plate in the inky sky, offering little solace against the encroaching darkness.  St. Jude's, a sprawling red-brick behemoth perched on a bluff overlooking Lake Superior, usually hummed with a low thrum of activity, even at this late hour.  But tonight, an unnatural quiet had settled, broken only by the mournful wail of the wind and the rhythmic slosh of the icy waves against the shore far below.  Amelia, her gloved hands shoved deep into the pockets of her thick wool coat, shivered, a prickle of unease running down her spine.  This was not the St. Jude's she knew.  Something was different.  Something was wrong.
