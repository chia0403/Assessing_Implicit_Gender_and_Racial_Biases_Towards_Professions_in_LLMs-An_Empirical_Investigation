The biting November wind, sharp as a freshly honed axe, whipped through the frosted pines of the Bitterroot Mountains.  Dawn, a bruised purple and grey, barely illuminated the logging road that snaked its way up the steep slopes.  Frost crunched beneath the heavy boots of Jedediah "Jed"  Callahan as he trudged toward the stand of ponderosa pine marked for felling. His breath plumed out in white puffs, momentarily obscuring the ragged scar that bisected his left cheek, a permanent souvenir from a close encounter with a falling limb three seasons back.  The air, thick with the resinous scent of pine, held a promise of snow, and Jed hoped they'd finish clearing this section before the first flakes fell.  The higher they climbed, the more exposed the terrain became, and the fiercer the wind howled, rattling the bare branches of the aspen trees like skeletal fingers. The valley below, shrouded in a pre-dawn mist, seemed a world away, a place of warmth and quiet that belonged to another life.  Jed shifted his axe, the smooth hickory handle familiar and comforting in his grip. Today was going to be a long one.
