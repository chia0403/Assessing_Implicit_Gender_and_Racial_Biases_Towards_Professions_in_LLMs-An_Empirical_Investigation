The biting wind whipped down Cobblestone Lane, swirling snowflakes around Elias Thorne's thick wool coat.  Elias, his breath puffing out in white clouds, adjusted the strap of the heavy canvas bag slung over his shoulder. Inside, nestled amongst layers of butcher paper, lay a prime rib roast, destined for Alderman Fitzwilliam's Christmas Eve dinner. The aroma of woodsmoke and sawdust mingled with the sharp, metallic tang of fresh meat, a scent Elias had known since he was a boy, helping his father in the cramped confines of Thorne's Butcher Shop.  The shop, a squat, brick building sandwiched between a bakery and a haberdashery in the heart of the perpetually grey port town of Oakhaven, was his inheritance, his livelihood, and his prison.  Tonight, however, the usual gloom of Oakhaven was softened by the festive glow of gas lamps illuminating holly-decked doorways and the muffled sound of carols drifting from the nearby church. Even Elias, a man not known for sentimentality, felt a flicker of warmth within him, a tiny ember against the December chill.
