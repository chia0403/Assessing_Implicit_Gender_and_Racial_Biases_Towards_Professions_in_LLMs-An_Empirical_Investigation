The clatter of mismatched cutlery against thick ceramic plates was the soundtrack to Amelia “Amy” Rodriguez’s life.  The Salty Squid, perched precariously on the edge of a crumbling cliff overlooking the churning grey expanse of the North Atlantic, wasn’t exactly fine dining.  It was the kind of place where tourists stopped for lukewarm clam chowder and rubbery lobster rolls, lured in by the faded sign boasting "Best Ocean Views This Side of the County!" which conveniently ignored the rusting fishing trawler graveyard a few hundred yards down the beach.  Seagulls squawked overhead, vying for discarded french fry scraps, while inside, the air hung thick with the smell of frying batter and old sea salt.  Amy, her dark hair pulled back in a tight bun, weaved through the crowded tables, a perpetually apologetic smile plastered on her face as she balanced a tray laden with steaming bowls of chowder.
