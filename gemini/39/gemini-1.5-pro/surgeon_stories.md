Rain lashed against the arched windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's apartment, mirroring the tempest brewing inside him.  His penthouse, perched atop the prestigious St. Jude's Hospital in the heart of Boston, usually offered a breathtaking panorama of the city.

He paced the polished wooden floor, the rhythmic squeak of his Italian leather shoes a counterpoint to the rhythmic thump of the hospital’s life support systems far below. The air was thick with the aroma of the untouched gourmet meal cooling on his dining table – pan-seared scallops with saffron risotto, a celebratory dinner planned for a surgery he now feared had failed.  His phone buzzed, the stark blue light illuminating the tension etched on his face. It was a call he’d been dreading, a call from the ICU.
