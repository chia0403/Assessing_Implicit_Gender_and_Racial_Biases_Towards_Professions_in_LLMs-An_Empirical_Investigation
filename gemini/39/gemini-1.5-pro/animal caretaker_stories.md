The biting November wind whipped Amelia Reyes’s thick, dark braid across her face as she trudged across the frozen mud of the Yorkshire Wildlife Park. Dawn painted the sky in bruised purples and hesitant oranges, a stark contrast to the crisp white frost clinging to the dry grasses.  Amelia, bundled in a parka that swallowed her petite frame, exhaled a plume of white that momentarily obscured the towering aviary looming ahead.  It housed the park’s newest residents: a pair of Andean condors, majestic scavengers with wingspans that could eclipse a small car. Their arrival had been the talk of the park for months, and Amelia, the head avian caretaker, bore the weighty responsibility of ensuring their smooth transition to their new home. The pressure was immense, compounded by the subtle, persistent anxiety that always gnawed at her when dealing with these magnificent, yet unpredictable, creatures. Today, that anxiety felt particularly sharp, a premonition clinging to her like the frost on the ground.  The male condor, Inti, had been refusing food for the past two days, a worrying sign that something was amiss.
