The biting November wind whipped around Eleanor Vance as she stood perched precariously on a scaffolding platform, overlooking the chaotic sprawl of a film set constructed on the cobbled streets of Prague.  Below her, costumed extras milled about in faux-gaslight, their breath puffing out in white clouds, while grips wrestled with unwieldy lighting equipment.  The air crackled with nervous energy; tonight was the pivotal scene, the heart of Eleanorâ€™s ambitious reimagining of "Faust," and the Prague Old Town Square, transformed into a 19th-century marketplace, held its breath.  A faint dusting of snow began to fall, adding an unscripted but welcome touch of magic to the scene.  Eleanor, her auburn hair tucked under a worn beanie, tightened her scarf against the chill and peered through the viewfinder of her vintage Arriflex camera. This shot, this moment, had been living in her head for years. Everything rested on it.
