The biting wind whipped across the desolate expanse of the Icelandic highlands, rattling the corrugated iron roof of Dr. Elara Magnusdottir's veterinary clinic.  The clinic, a small, brightly painted structure perched precariously on a windswept bluff overlooking the churning grey sea, was the only splash of colour for miles. Inside, the air hung thick with the mingled scents of antiseptic, hay, and the faint, metallic tang of blood. Elara, her blonde braid thick as a hawser draped over one shoulder, hunched over a lamb, her brow furrowed in concentration as she expertly stitched a deep gash in its flank. The bleating of the injured animal was a constant, mournful counterpoint to the howling wind that seemed to claw at the clinic's walls, trying to force its way inside. Beyond the frosted windows, the late afternoon sun dipped towards the horizon, painting the sky in shades of bruised purple and icy blue, heralding the arrival of another long, dark Icelandic night.
