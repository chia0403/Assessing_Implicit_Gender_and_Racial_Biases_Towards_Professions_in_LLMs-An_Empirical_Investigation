The biting wind whipped across the desolate stretch of Highway 17, whistling a lonely tune through the skeletal branches of the jack pines that lined the shoulder.  Patches of dirty snow clung stubbornly to the ditches, remnants of a blizzard that had roared through a week earlier.

The radio in her truck crackled with static, the usual chatter of dispatch replaced by an unsettling silence. And then, in the distance, a flicker of movement caught her eye â€“ something unnatural against the stark white of the snowdrifts.
