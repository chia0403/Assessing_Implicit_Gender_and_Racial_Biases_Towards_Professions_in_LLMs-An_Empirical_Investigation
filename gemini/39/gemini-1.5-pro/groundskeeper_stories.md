The biting November wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks that lined the drive, tearing at the last clinging leaves and sending them spiralling across the manicured lawns of Athelney Manor.  Frost crunched under Elias Thorne's boots, a familiar, almost comforting sound in the pre-dawn chill.  Elias, bundled in a thick tweed coat and a knitted cap pulled low over his ears, paused at the edge of the rose garden, his breath clouding the air.  The once vibrant blooms had succumbed to the season, leaving behind a tangle of thorny brown stems.  Athelney, once a jewel of the Somerset countryside, now wore a mantle of autumnal decay, a melancholic beauty Elias found strangely appealing. He'd been groundskeeper here for twenty-two years, and the ebb and flow of the seasons, the cycle of life and death played out across the estate's twenty acres, had become interwoven with his own existence. This morning, however, the usual serenity was tinged with an unsettling sense of foreboding. A single magpie perched on the sundial, its black feathers gleaming in the weak light, and Elias knew, with a certainty that chilled him deeper than the frost, that something was about to change.
