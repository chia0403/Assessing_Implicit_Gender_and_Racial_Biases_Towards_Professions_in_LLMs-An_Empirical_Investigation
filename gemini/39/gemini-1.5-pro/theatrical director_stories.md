The velvet curtains of the dilapidated Grand Majestic Theatre smelled of dust and forgotten dreams, a fitting aroma for Elias Thorneâ€™s current state of mind.  Rain lashed against the grimy, arched windows, mirroring the tempest brewing inside him.  Elias, full name Elias Peregrine Thorne, a man whose theatrical vision had once ignited Broadway, now stood amidst the peeling paint and scattered props of a theatre clinging precariously to existence in the forgotten corner of a small coastal town called Port Blossom, Maine. The salty air, usually a source of inspiration, felt heavy with the weight of his past failures. This wasn't the grand revival he'd envisioned; this was theatrical purgatory, a place where ambition went to wither and die alongside wilting hydrangeas and chipped teacups from half-remembered productions.  Tonight, however, was different.  Tonight, Elias had a last chance.  A new script, a local cast brimming with raw talent, and a flicker of that old, familiar fire in his belly.  Tonight, the Grand Majestic, and perhaps Elias himself, would either rise from the ashes or crumble into oblivion.
