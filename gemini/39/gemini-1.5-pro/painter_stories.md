The salt spray kissed Aurelia Josephine Moreau's face as she wrestled her easel against the biting wind.  The small cove, nestled between two towering cliffs of black volcanic rock on the Isle of Skye, was almost entirely her own this blustery October afternoon.  Grey clouds, heavy with the promise of rain, scudded low across the sky, occasionally revealing glimpses of a bruised purple sunset struggling to break through.  The crashing waves, a churning froth of emerald green and white, pounded against the shore, their rhythmic roar the soundtrack to Aurelia's solitude.  Her paint box, a weathered wooden case stained with the ghosts of a thousand colours, lay open at her feet, its vibrant contents a stark contrast to the monochrome landscape.  She gripped her brush, a fine sable point trembling slightly in her hand, and stared at the turbulent scene before her, searching for the heart of its untamed beauty.
