The biting November wind whipped around Eleanor Vance, plastering stray strands of her auburn hair across her lips as she hurried down Bleecker Street.  Neon signs buzzed to life in the twilight, casting a kaleidoscope of colors across the slick, rain-washed pavement. The air hummed with the city's usual cacophony â€“ the rumble of the subway deep below, the blare of taxi horns, the snippets of conversations carried on the wind. Eleanor clutched her portfolio tighter, the smooth leather a comforting weight against her palm.  Tonight was the night. Tonight, she was pitching her designs to the notoriously difficult Julian Thorne, owner of the cutting-edge Thorne Galleries, a space coveted by every artist in Manhattan.  The gallery, a renovated warehouse tucked between a vintage bookstore and a dimly lit speakeasy, pulsed with an energy that both thrilled and intimidated her.  Its large, steel-framed windows offered glimpses of the minimalist, white-walled interior, and Eleanor could already feel the weight of expectation pressing down on her.
