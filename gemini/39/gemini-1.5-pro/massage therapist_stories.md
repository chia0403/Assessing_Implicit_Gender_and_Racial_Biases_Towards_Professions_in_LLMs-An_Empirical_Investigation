The late afternoon sun, filtered through the gauzy curtains of Serenity Now Massage Therapy, cast long shadows across the worn Persian rug. Dust motes danced in the golden light, illuminating the faint scent of lavender and chamomile that perpetually clung to the air.  Eleanor Vance, her hands still faintly tingling from the last client's knotted back, surveyed her small but meticulously organized treatment room. Outside, the rumble of Chicago traffic was a muted roar, a stark contrast to the tranquil haven she'd cultivated within the brick walls of her Lincoln Park studio.  A brass chime tinkled, signaling the arrival of her next appointment, and a nervous flutter danced in Eleanor's stomach. This wasn't just any client; this was Alderman Theodore Hayes, a man whose influence stretched far beyond the confines of her cozy little world.  And something told Eleanor this appointment was going to be anything but relaxing.
