Rain lashed against the stained-glass window depicting Saint Jude, patron saint of lost causes, a fitting emblem for The Rusty Mug.  Smoke, thick with the scent of stale beer and desperation, clung to the low-beamed ceiling.  Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne, her fiery red hair pulled back in a tight bun, wiped down the mahogany bar with a practiced hand, the rag squeaking a mournful rhythm against the damp wood.  The Mug, nestled in a forgotten corner of Greenwich Village, was rarely bustling, even on a Friday night, but tonight, the silence was particularly heavy.  Only two patrons occupied the worn leather booths – a skeletal old man nursing a whiskey, his face etched with a lifetime of regrets, and a young woman hunched over a notebook, her pen scratching furiously against the paper, oblivious to the storm raging outside and the melancholy that permeated every inch of the bar.  Amy glanced at the clock – 11:57 pm. Three minutes until closing, and then, blessed solitude.  Or so she thought.  A gust of wind rattled the front door, its hinges groaning in protest, and a figure, silhouetted against the flashing neon sign outside, stepped into The Rusty Mug.
