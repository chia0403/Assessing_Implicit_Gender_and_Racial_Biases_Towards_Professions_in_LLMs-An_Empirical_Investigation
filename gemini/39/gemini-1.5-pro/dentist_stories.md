The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Eleanor Vance Cartwright as she hurried across the cobbled lane, her breath misting in the frigid air.  The wrought-iron sign of "Cartwright Dental Surgery," hanging above the emerald green door of her converted Georgian townhouse, swayed precariously in the gusts.  Ashworth-on-Sea, a quaint, if somewhat faded, seaside town in Northumberland, clung to its old-world charm even as the encroaching winter threatened to swallow it whole.  The sky, the colour of bruised plums, promised snow, and the normally bustling harbour was deserted save for a lone trawler battling the choppy grey waves.  Inside, the warm glow spilling from the surgery windows beckoned Eleanor towards the comforting scent of clove oil and the familiar hum of the autoclave.  Tonight, however, the usual tranquility of her practice held an undercurrent of unease. A new patient was due, one referred by Dr. Alistair Finch, a notoriously eccentric colleague from the nearby town of Alnwick, and Eleanor had a distinct premonition that this appointment would be anything but routine.
