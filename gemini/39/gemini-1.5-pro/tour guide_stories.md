The salt spray kissed Amelia “Amy” Reyes’s face as the ferry chugged its way through the choppy waters of the San Juan Islands.  Mount Rainier, a slumbering giant capped with snow, loomed in the distance, a majestic backdrop to the swirling greys and greens of the Puget Sound. Amy, bundled in a bright yellow rain slicker that clashed spectacularly with her fiery red hair, gripped the railing and surveyed her charges.  A motley crew of twenty-odd tourists, ranging from a gaggle of chattering teenagers to a silver-haired couple holding hands, all squinted against the wind, a mixture of anticipation and mild seasickness etched on their faces. They were on their way to Friday Harbor, a quaint town nestled on San Juan Island, known for its charming boutiques, art galleries, and, most importantly, its resident orca population.  Amy, a seasoned tour guide for Island Adventures Whale Watching Tours, knew the waters like the back of her hand, but even she felt a thrill of excitement at the prospect of encountering these magnificent creatures.  The air hummed with a palpable sense of adventure, a feeling Amy never tired of sharing.
