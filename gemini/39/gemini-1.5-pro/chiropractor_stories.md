The neon "Open" sign buzzed erratically, casting a sickly green glow across the rain-slicked asphalt of Magnolia Street. Inside Magnolia Family Chiropractic, Dr. Elias Thorne, D.C., sighed, the sound swallowed by the rhythmic drumming of rain against the large picture window showcasing a ridiculously cheerful skeleton contorted into a pretzel pose.  It was 7:48 pm on a Tuesday, and Elias was still waiting for his last patient, a Mrs. Henderson, who was notorious for being both perpetually late and a prolific complainer.  The small clinic, nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually empty storefront that had housed everything from a psychic to a pet grooming salon in the past five years, usually hummed with the low thrum of the adjusting table and the gentle crackle of therapeutic ultrasound.  Tonight, however, the only sounds were the rain, the buzzing neon sign, and the ticking of the vintage anatomical clock Elias had inherited from his grandfather, a clock whose second hand seemed to mock the slow crawl of time.  He rubbed his temples, the beginnings of a tension headache forming behind his eyes, a familiar occupational hazard.  Magnolia, Alabama, in late October, was usually bathed in the warm, golden light of autumn, but tonight, the oppressive grey sky and relentless rain mirrored the weight settling in Elias’s chest. Something felt… off.
