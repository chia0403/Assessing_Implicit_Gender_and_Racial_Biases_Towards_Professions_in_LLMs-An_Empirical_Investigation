The salt spray kissed Amelia Reyes's face as she perched precariously on the jagged black rocks of Reynisfjara beach in Iceland. The wind, a howling, icy beast, tore at her thick wool coat and whipped her dark hair across her face, momentarily blinding her.  Grey, roiling waves crashed against the basalt columns, their white crests exploding into a fine mist that hung in the air like a phantom.  Amelia lowered her camera, a well-worn Nikon D850, and tucked a stray strand of hair behind her ear.  The volcanic sand, black as midnight, stretched before her, leading towards the ominous silhouette of Dyrh√≥laey, a massive stone arch jutting out into the turbulent North Atlantic.  She was here, braving the elements, for one shot, one perfect image that would capture the raw, untamed beauty of this desolate, breathtaking landscape.  The light, a fleeting, ethereal glow filtering through the perpetually overcast sky, was exactly what she had been waiting for.
