The rusted pipe shrieked like a banshee, spitting a jet of rusty water directly onto Elias Thorne's face.  He sputtered, wiping his brow with the back of his equally grimy hand, the metallic tang of old plumbing clinging to his skin.  It was just past dawn in the sleepy, fog-choked coastal town of Port Blossom, Maine. The salt air, usually a welcome scent, did little to dispel the pervasive odor of mildew emanating from the crawlspace beneath Mrs. Gable's precariously perched Victorian.  Elias, his sturdy frame wedged between the damp earth and the groaning floor joists, sighed.  This was the third burst pipe this week, and the sun hadn't even fully crested the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Tooth Mountains looming over the town.  Port Blossom, with its charming, pastel-painted houses and quaint antique shops, hid a secret beneath its picturesque facade: a plumbing system older than most of its residents, a ticking time bomb of corroded copper and crumbling cast iron.  And Elias Thorne was the only one standing between the town and a watery apocalypse.
