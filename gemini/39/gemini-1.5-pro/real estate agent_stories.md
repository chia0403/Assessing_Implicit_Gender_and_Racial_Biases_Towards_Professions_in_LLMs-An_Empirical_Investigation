The late afternoon sun, a hazy orange orb sinking towards the Pacific, cast long shadows across the manicured lawns of Rancho Palos Verdes.  A crisp sea breeze, carrying the faint scent of salt and eucalyptus, ruffled the impeccably tailored blazer of Amelia “Amy” Reyes-Fitzgerald.  She stood on the flagstone patio of a sprawling Spanish Colonial revival, her heels clicking softly against the warm stone.  This house, perched on a bluff with panoramic ocean views, was her latest listing, and Amy, with her years of experience selling luxury properties along the California coast, knew it was a winner.  The problem wasn’t the house; it was the client.  Eccentric millionaire, Horace Van Derlyn, had a list of demands longer than the property deed, and Amy, despite her professional smile, was beginning to feel the strain.  A flock of pelicans soared past, silhouetted against the fiery sky, oblivious to the simmering tension brewing beneath them.  This, Amy thought with a sigh, was going to be a long escrow.
