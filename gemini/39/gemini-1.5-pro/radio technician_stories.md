The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorne's ankles as he wrestled with the rusted lock on the shed door. Flakes of paint, the colour of dried blood, chipped off and swirled away like confetti.  Inside, nestled amongst cobwebs thick as shrouds and smelling of damp earth and mothballs, was the heart of WXBR – Briar Creek's only radio station. Elias, bundled in a thick wool coat against the encroaching Appalachian winter, finally managed to yank the padlock open. The rusty screech echoed across the deserted fairgrounds, the only other sound the mournful sigh of wind through the skeletal Ferris wheel looming over him.  Briar Creek, Virginia, population 842 (and dwindling), wasn't much to look at, but WXBR, even with its limited range and temperamental transmitter, was Elias’s kingdom, and tonight, he had a feeling something extraordinary was about to happen.
