Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of Martha "Marty" Velasquez's office, a relentless drumming that mirrored the headache pounding behind her eyes.  Neon light from the Hong Kong noodle bar across the alley seeped through the grimy window, painting streaks of greasy crimson and jade across the peeling wallpaper. Marty, her full name being  Isadora Martha Velasquez, though no one dared call her Isadora, sat hunched over her desk, the cheap particleboard groaning beneath a precarious stack of unpaid bills. Cigarette smoke, thick and blue, curled towards the ceiling fan, which wheezed in a futile attempt to circulate the stale air. It was a Tuesday night in Kowloon, the kind of night that clung to the skin like a damp shroud, and Marty, despite the gnawing emptiness in her stomach, found herself strangely comforted by the familiar misery of it all. The year was 1988, and Hong Kong hummed with a nervous energy, a city poised on the precipice of change, just like Marty herself.
