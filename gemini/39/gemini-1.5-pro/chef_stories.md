The biting November wind whipped off the Puget Sound, carrying the scent of brine and pine needles and slapping against the windows of "Bisque & Bones," a small, stubbornly independent bistro nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually-closed comic book store in Seattle's Ballard neighborhood.  Inside, the air was thick with the aroma of simmering shellfish and rosemary-infused olive oil.  Eleanor Josephine Dupres, head chef and sole proprietor of Bisque & Bones, hummed along to a Billie Holiday record as she meticulously arranged a plate of Dungeness crab ravioli, a drizzle of saffron cream sauce transforming the dish into a miniature work of art.  The restaurant, with its mismatched chairs, exposed brick walls, and the single, steadfastly drooping ficus tree in the corner, was her sanctuary, her canvas, her life's work.  Tonight, however, the usual quiet anticipation of the dinner rush was laced with a distinct undercurrent of unease.  Eleanor had a feeling something was about to change.
