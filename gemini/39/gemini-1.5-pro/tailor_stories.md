The biting wind, scented with brine and coal smoke, whipped down Tailor’s Alley, tugging at the sign hanging above Elias Thorne’s shop.  The sign, depicting a gleaming silver needle threaded with crimson silk, creaked rhythmically against its wrought-iron bracket. Inside, the single oil lamp cast long, dancing shadows across the cluttered workroom. Elias, his spectacles perched precariously on his nose, squinted at the intricate pattern he’d sketched onto a length of emerald green velvet.  Dust motes, illuminated by the lamplight, swirled around him like tiny, curious spirits.  Outside, the cobbled streets of Port Blossom were slick with a recent rain, reflecting the hazy glow of gas lamps that struggled against the encroaching dusk.  The year was 1888, and the normally bustling port town was hushed, holding its breath against a coming storm, both meteorological and otherwise.
