The clatter of horse-drawn carriages on cobblestones echoed through the tall windows of Mademoiselle Elodie Beaumont's atelier, a counterpoint to the rhythmic snick-snick of her shears. The atelier, nestled on a quiet side street just off the bustling Place Vendôme in 1888 Paris, was a sanctuary of silks and satins, a haven of hushed creativity. Sunlight, filtered through the dusty glass panes, illuminated swirling clouds of powdered chalk and highlighted the vibrant hues of fabric swatches pinned to a velvet-covered board.  Elodie, her dark hair pulled back in a severe chignon that belied her youthful twenty-four years, meticulously draped a length of emerald green silk across a dress form, her brow furrowed in concentration.  The air, thick with the scent of beeswax and lavender, hung heavy with the promise of a masterpiece yet to be born. Outside, the Belle Époque bloomed in all its gilded glory, but within Elodie's world, beauty was crafted, stitch by meticulous stitch.
