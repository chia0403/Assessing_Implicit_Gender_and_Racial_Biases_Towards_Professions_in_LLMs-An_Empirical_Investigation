The biting November wind whipped around Professor Alistair Finchley, tugging at the edges of his tweed coat as he hurried across the cobbled quad of St. Jude's College, Oxford.  Gargoyles leered down from the honey-coloured stone walls, their grotesque faces slick with rain.  The afternoon light, already fading at a quarter past four, cast long, skeletal shadows that danced and stretched across the manicured lawns, giving the normally serene college grounds an unsettling, almost gothic air.  Alistair clutched a stack of essays marked with a flourish of red ink, his breath misting in the frigid air.  He was late for his weekly meeting with the Dean, a prospect that filled him with a familiar dread, akin to anticipating a particularly unpleasant dental procedure.  The Dean, a stickler for punctuality and academic rigor, had a way of making even the most accomplished professors feel like errant schoolboys.  Tonight's agenda was particularly daunting:  budget cuts, dwindling student enrollment in the Classics department, and, most ominously, the rumours of a merger with the rival college across the Cherwell River, a prospect that Alistair viewed with utter horror.
