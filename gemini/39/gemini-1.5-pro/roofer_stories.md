The tar hissed and bubbled, a miniature black lake reflecting the distorted image of the Seattle skyline.  Elijah "Eli" Blackwood wiped the sweat from his brow with the back of his calloused hand, the grime smearing across his forehead like war paint.  He perched precariously on the edge of Mrs. Henderson's gabled roof, three stories above the bustling, rain-slicked streets of Ballard. The biting November wind whipped at his canvas jacket, carrying the scent of salt water and pine from Puget Sound.  Grey clouds, heavy with the promise of another downpour, scudded low overhead, casting long, dancing shadows across the neighborhood's patchwork of brick and shingle rooftops. Eli adjusted his safety harness, the familiar click of the carabiner a small comfort in the vast, swirling emptiness surrounding him.  Below, the world continued oblivious to his precarious existence, a miniature drama unfolding in fast forward. Cars zipped along Market Street, their headlights blurring in the encroaching twilight.  The neon glow of the Pacific Inn beckoned warmly, promising refuge and dry socks. Eli had another hour, maybe two, before the rain hit. And then the real fun would begin.
