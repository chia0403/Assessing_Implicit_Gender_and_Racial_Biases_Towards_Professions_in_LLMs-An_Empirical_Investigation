The biting wind whipped a strand of her auburn hair across her face, and she pushed it back with a sigh, steeling herself for the encounter.  She had to make one more sale, just one, to meet her quota this month.  And if anyone needed a little sunshine in a bottle, it was the patrons of this desolate establishment.
