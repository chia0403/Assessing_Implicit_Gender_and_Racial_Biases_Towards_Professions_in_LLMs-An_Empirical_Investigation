The biting wind whipped off the Lake Michigan and howled down Chicago Avenue, rattling the frosted panes of Alfonzo "Fonzie" Pasquale Moretti's barbershop.  Inside, the warm air hummed with the quiet buzz of fluorescent lights and the faint, soapy scent of Barbicide.  Fonzie, a man built like a fire hydrant with a silver pompadour that defied gravity, stood surveying his small kingdom.  The shop, nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed Polish bakery, was a study in organized chaos.  Antique barber chairs lined one wall, their worn leather gleaming under the warm light.  A mismatched collection of framed photographs – family portraits, faded newspaper clippings of forgotten baseball heroes, and a signed photo of Frank Sinatra – adorned the other.  The air crackled with the anticipatory silence that always preceded the morning rush. Outside, the sky, a bruised purple, hinted at the coming snow, but inside Fonzie’s, it was always a comfortable seventy-two degrees, a constant in the ever-changing Chicago landscape.
