The fluorescent lights of Gentle Dental hummed a monotonous B-flat, a soundtrack Amelia “Amy” Rodriguez had grown strangely fond of over the past five years.  Outside, the Charleston, South Carolina, sun beat down on King Street, promising a humid afternoon thick with the scent of jasmine and horse-drawn carriage manure.  But inside, the air was conditioned to a crisp 68 degrees, smelling faintly of mint and disinfectant – a scent Amy associated with order and calm. This Tuesday morning, however, felt anything but calm.  A new patient, Mr. Silas Blackwood, was due any minute, and rumour had it he was a notoriously difficult case, both dentally and dispositionally. Amy adjusted the pastel bib on the pristine dental chair, her stomach fluttering like a trapped hummingbird.  She smoothed down her teal scrubs and forced a smile.  Whatever Mr. Blackwood threw at her, she was ready. Or so she thought.
