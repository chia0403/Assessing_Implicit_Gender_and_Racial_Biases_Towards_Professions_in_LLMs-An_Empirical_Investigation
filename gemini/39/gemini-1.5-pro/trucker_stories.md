The neon "Truck Stop Oasis" sign buzzed erratically, casting a sickly yellow glow across the rain-slicked asphalt.  Diesel fumes mingled with the scent of stale coffee and frying onions, clinging to Elara Jane Holloway like a second skin. She sat hunched over a chipped Formica table in the corner booth, the flickering light catching the worry lines etched around her hazel eyes. Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune, whipping the rain into a frenzy against the windows of the diner. I-80, stretching eastward into the infinite darkness of the Nebraska night, offered no solace.  Elara’s rig, a battered Peterbilt 379 she’d affectionately nicknamed "Betsy," sat patiently in the truck stop’s lot, its chrome gleaming faintly beneath the sodium lamps.  Three days behind schedule, a thousand miles from home, and with a cargo of orchids destined for a Manhattan florist, Elara had a feeling this was going to be one hell of a night.
