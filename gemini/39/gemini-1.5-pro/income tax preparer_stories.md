The flickering fluorescent lights of Harold Finchley's office cast a sickly yellow pallor over everything.  Dust motes danced in the stale air, illuminated by the thin beams that managed to penetrate the perpetually drawn blinds.  Tax season was officially over, but for Harold Perkins, CPA, it never truly ended.  Outside, the vibrant cherry blossoms of Washington D.C. were exploding into riotous bloom, a cruel mockery of the grey, paper-filled landscape that dominated Harold's existence. His small office, tucked away on the second floor of a nondescript building on Connecticut Avenue, was a testament to his dedication to the arcane intricacies of the tax code.  Stacks of folders, bursting with receipts and W-2s, threatened to topple onto the worn linoleum floor.  The faint aroma of stale coffee and desperation clung to the air like a persistent ghost. This year, however, something was different.  A single, unmarked manila envelope sat on Harold's desk, a stark contrast to the meticulously labeled chaos surrounding it.
