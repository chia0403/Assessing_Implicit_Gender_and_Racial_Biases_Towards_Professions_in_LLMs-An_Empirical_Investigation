The rain hammered against the panoramic windows of Amelia Thorneâ€™s forty-second-floor office, mirroring the relentless pounding in her temples.  Below, the lights of Chicago glittered like a scattered handful of jewels, a breathtaking vista usually appreciated by Amelia, Chief Operating Officer of Thorne & Sterling Pharmaceuticals. Tonight, however, the cityscape was just a blurred, shimmering backdrop to the tension tightening its grip around her.  Mahogany furniture gleamed under the recessed lighting, and the air hummed with the quiet efficiency of the state-of-the-art air filtration system.  Everything in the office spoke of controlled elegance, a stark contrast to the storm brewing both outside and within Amelia herself.  A single lamp illuminated the polished surface of her desk, where a pristine white folder lay waiting, its contents holding the potential to either catapult Thorne & Sterling to unprecedented success or send it spiralling into ruin.  Amelia reached for it, her hand trembling almost imperceptibly.  The future of the company, and perhaps her own, rested on the decision she was about to make.
