The fluorescent lights of St. Jude's Hospital hummed a monotonous B flat, a soundtrack Amelia Reyes had grown accustomed to over her five years as a phlebotomist.  The pre-dawn quiet, however, was a rare and unsettling treat. Usually, by 5:00 am, the phlebotomy lab, nestled in the labyrinthine basement of the hospital, would be buzzing with activity â€“ the whir of centrifuges, the clatter of trays, and the low murmur of technicians prepping for their morning rounds. This morning, however, only the rhythmic beep of a malfunctioning coffee machine punctuated the silence. Amelia, her dark hair pulled back in a tight bun and her name tag pinned neatly to her crisp white coat, stood at the window, gazing out at the slowly lightening sky over the sprawling cityscape of Chicago.  A thin layer of frost clung to the windowpane, reflecting the nervous flutter in her stomach. This wasn't just any Tuesday. This was the day the new oncology ward opened, and Amelia had a feeling it was going to be a long one.
