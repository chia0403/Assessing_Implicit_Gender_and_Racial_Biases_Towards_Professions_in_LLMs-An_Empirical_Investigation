The fluorescent lights of Northwood High hummed a monotonous B-flat, a soundtrack Amelia Reyes had come to associate with the impending Monday morning rush.  Rain lashed against the large window of her office, blurring the already dreary November landscape into a watercolor wash of gray and green.  Amelia, full name Amelia Sofia Reyes, adjusted the framed photo of her grinning niece on her otherwise spartan desk.  It was a small, cheerful rebellion against the beige walls and institutional carpet, a reminder of the life that existed beyond the pressures and anxieties of teenage existence. Northwood High, nestled in the heart of the sleepy, yet surprisingly affluent, town of Oakhaven, Massachusetts, was Ameliaâ€™s battlefield.  Here, amidst college applications, friendship dramas, and the occasional existential crisis, she waged a quiet war against apathy and underachievement, armed with a warm smile, a bottomless pot of coffee, and an unwavering belief in the potential of every student who walked through her door.  Today, however, a different kind of battle awaited her.  The quiet before the storm was particularly still, and Amelia felt a prickle of unease, a premonition that this Monday was about to be anything but ordinary.
