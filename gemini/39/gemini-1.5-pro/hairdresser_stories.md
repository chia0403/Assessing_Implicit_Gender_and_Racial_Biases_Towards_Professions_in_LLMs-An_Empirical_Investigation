The flickering neon sign of "Shear Perfection" buzzed erratically, casting a lurid, pink glow across the rain-slicked streets of Oakhaven. Inside, Amelia Rose Hawthorne, her name stitched in elegant cursive on her cerulean apron, sighed, watching the downpour blur the reflection of the empty salon.  It was a Thursday night in late October, the kind of night where the damp chill seeped into your bones and the only sound louder than the drumming rain was the mournful wail of the wind whistling through the gaps in the old window frames.  Oakhaven, a once-bustling mill town nestled in the foothills of the Appalachians, had fallen on hard times, and Amelia’s salon, like many other small businesses, was struggling to stay afloat.  The air hung thick with the scent of unsold perm solution and Amelia’s faint, floral perfume, a poignant reminder of better days.
