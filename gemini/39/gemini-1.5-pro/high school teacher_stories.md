The biting November wind whipped around Amelia Grace Hawthorne's ankles as she hurried across the faculty parking lot, clutching a stack of graded essays to her chest.  St. Ignatius Catholic High School loomed before her, a gothic behemoth of dark brick and leaded-glass windows, perched precariously on the bluff overlooking the churning grey expanse of Lake Superior. The late afternoon sun, already dipping below the horizon, cast long, skeletal shadows from the gnarled oak trees that lined the drive, giving the whole scene a distinctly unsettling air. Inside, a faint, discordant choir rehearsal echoed, a haunting counterpoint to the rhythmic crash of the waves below. Amelia, her breath fogging in the frigid air, shivered not entirely from the cold, but from a growing unease that had settled deep in her bones since the start of the school year. Something felt wrong at St. Ignatius, something beyond the usual teenage angst and administrative headaches.  And she suspected it had something to do with the new student, the quiet, watchful boy who sat in the back of her English Literature class.
