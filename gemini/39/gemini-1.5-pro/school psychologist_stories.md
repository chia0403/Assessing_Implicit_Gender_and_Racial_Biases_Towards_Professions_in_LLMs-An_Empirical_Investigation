The biting November wind whipped Amelia Reyes’s thick, dark hair across her face as she hurried across the bleak, asphalt parking lot of Northwood High.  Flakes of snow, premature and hesitant, began to drift down, clinging to the bare branches of the sycamore trees that lined the perimeter of the school. Inside, a fluorescent hum permeated the hallways, a stark contrast to the muted grayness of the outside world. Amelia, clutching a thermos of lukewarm coffee and a bulging file folder, braced herself for the day. It was already shaping up to be one of *those* Mondays – the kind that started with a spilled coffee in her car and ended with a parent-teacher conference that threatened to devolve into a shouting match.

This morning, however, a different kind of unease settled in her stomach. It wasn’t the usual Monday morning dread. This was something… else.
