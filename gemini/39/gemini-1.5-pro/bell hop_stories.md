The revolving doors of the Grand Majestic Hotel wheezed like a bellows, exhaling a gust of chilled November air that ruffled the perfectly placed newspapers in Silas Finch's arms.  Built in 1928, the Majestic was a relic of opulence, a monument to a bygone era of jazz and flapper dresses, now clinging precariously to its five-star rating in the heart of downtown Chicago. Its lobby, a cavernous space of marble and mahogany, hummed with the low murmur of polite conversation and the clinking of ice in crystal glasses.  Silas, a wiry young man with a neatly trimmed mustache and a nametag pinned to his crisp, maroon waistcoat, navigated the intricate dance of the lobby with practiced ease. He knew the rhythm of the place â€“ the precise moment Mrs. Henderson in suite 402 would descend for her afternoon tea, the habitual path Mr. Bartholomew took on his way to the cigar lounge, even the telltale creak of the grand staircase when the notoriously reclusive Mr. Blackwood ventured from his penthouse. Tonight, however, a different kind of energy thrummed beneath the polished surface. A nervous anticipation, like the air before a thunderstorm, crackled through the opulent space, and Silas felt it prickle the hairs on the back of his neck.
