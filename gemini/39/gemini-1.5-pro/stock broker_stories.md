The rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Elias Thorne's forty-second-floor office, blurring the already hazy cityscape of London below. Elias, whose full name was Elias Peregrine Thorne III, tapped a manicured fingernail against the cool glass, the rhythmic click a counterpoint to the chaotic symphony of the storm.  His office, a testament to both success and meticulously cultivated taste, was dominated by dark wood furniture, accented by the deep emerald green of a Persian rug and the gleaming chrome of a vintage espresso machine.  The air, usually thick with the scent of expensive coffee and old money, now held the metallic tang of ozone.  It was a Friday afternoon in late November, the kind that promised a bleak and unforgiving weekend, and the FTSE 100 was behaving as erratically as the weather outside.  A low hum emanated from the multiple screens displaying a dizzying array of figures, graphs, and flashing tickers, each a potential fortune gained or lost, each a gamble in the high-stakes game Elias played with ruthless precision.  Today, however, something felt different.  A premonition, perhaps, or simply the oppressive weight of the storm pressing down on him, whispering of an impending shift in the delicate balance of power he had so carefully constructed.
