Rain lashed against the arched windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's office, each drop a staccato note against the backdrop of Edinburgh's brooding sky.  The Gothic spires of the city, usually majestic, were shrouded in a thick, swirling mist that crept down the Royal Mile like a spectral hand. Inside, the only illumination came from the emerald glow of a banker's lamp, casting long, distorted shadows across the cluttered mahogany desk.  Open files, filled with disturbing crime scene photos and handwritten analyses, lay scattered around a half-eaten sandwich and a cooling cup of tea. Dr. Thorne, his dark hair dishevelled and his usually sharp grey eyes tinged with fatigue, stared intently at the swirling grey outside, his mind far from the academic papers strewn about him.  A sharp, insistent ringing shattered the silence. It wasn't his office phone, but the dedicated line reserved for only the most urgent of cases â€“ the one connected directly to Detective Inspector Ava MacIntyre of Police Scotland's Major Investigation Team. The case that had been haunting his sleep for weeks was about to take a sinister new turn.
