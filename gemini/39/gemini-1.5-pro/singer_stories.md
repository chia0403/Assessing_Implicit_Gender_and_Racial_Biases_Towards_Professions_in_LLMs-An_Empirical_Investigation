The flickering gaslights of the Moulin de la Lune cast a hazy, amber glow over the cobbled alleyway. Rain, a greasy, Parisian drizzle, slicked the stones and plastered Amelia Josephine Moreau's velvet cloak to her back.  A chill, deeper than the November air, snaked its way down her spine.  Tonight was the night.  Tonight, after years of singing in smoky backrooms and dingy cafes, Amelia would finally make her debut at the Moulin, the most celebrated cabaret in Montmartre.  The scent of cheap perfume and stale beer clung to the air, mingling with the distant, rhythmic thrum of the can-can.  Amelia clutched her worn songbook tighter, its pages softened with age and stained with the remnants of countless anxious rehearsals.  The muffled roar of the crowd from within the Moulin was a constant reminder of the precarious tightrope she was about to walk â€“ the intoxicating promise of success dangling just out of reach.
