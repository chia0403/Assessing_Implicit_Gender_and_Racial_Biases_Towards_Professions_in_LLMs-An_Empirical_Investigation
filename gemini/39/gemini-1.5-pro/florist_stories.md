The bell above the door of "Petal & Stem" tinkled a melancholic two-note tune as the last customer of the day departed, leaving Elara Thistlewick alone amongst the fragrant chaos of her shop. Outside, the November rain lashed against the large bay window, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Elara. Petal & Stem, nestled between a perpetually closed antique shop and a bustling bakery on Oakhaven's high street, was Elara's life's work, a riot of colour and scent in the otherwise grey town.  Tonight, however, the vibrant blooms seemed to mock her with their cheerful resilience, their very existence a stark contrast to the wilting hope in her own heart. The rent was due, the bills were piling up, and the once steady stream of customers had dwindled to a trickle, leaving Elara facing the chilling prospect of losing everything.
