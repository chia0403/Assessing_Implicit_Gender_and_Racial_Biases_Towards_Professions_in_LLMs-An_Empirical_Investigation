The fluorescent lights of Mrs. Eleanor Vance's kindergarten classroom hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the chaotic symphony of twenty-five five-year-olds excitedly chattering about the impending arrival of a class pet.  Rainbow-painted cinder block walls, adorned with construction paper turkeys and lopsided self-portraits, enclosed the small, brightly-colored room.  Outside, the crisp October air nipped at the edges of the large window, its pane frosted with miniature handprints. Maple leaves, blazing in shades of crimson and gold, swirled across the playground, mirroring the whirlwind of activity within. Crayola crayon shavings littered the checkered linoleum floor like confetti, and the distinct aroma of Elmer's glue and apple juice hung heavy in the air. Mrs. Vance, her auburn hair pulled back in a practical bun, knelt amidst the controlled chaos, a small smile playing on her lips as she watched her students' anticipation build.  Little did she know, the arrival of this fluffy, seemingly innocuous guinea pig would usher in a week of pandemonium unlike any she'd experienced in her twenty years of teaching.
