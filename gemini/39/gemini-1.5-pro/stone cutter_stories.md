The wind, sharp with the scent of pine and granite dust, whipped through the valley of Aisling, clinging to Elias Thorne's thick woolen coat. Grey clouds, heavy with the promise of snow, scudded low across the jagged peaks that ringed the isolated village.  Aisling itself clung to the mountainside like a lichen, its houses built of the same grey stone Elias spent his life shaping. Smoke curled lazily from chimneys, a fragile defiance against the encroaching cold.  Elias, his calloused hands tucked deep in his pockets, stood before the half-finished mausoleum of Lord Elmsworth, a looming structure of polished obsidian that dominated the village cemetery. The rhythmic *ting-ting-ting* of his chisel against stone, usually a comforting sound, was absent this morning. He was stalled, not by any flaw in the stone, but by a deep unease that settled in his gut like a lump of lead. This mausoleum, grander than any he'd crafted before, was meant to be his masterpiece. Yet, every swing of his hammer felt like a desecration, every carefully carved inscription a whisper of something profoundly wrong.
