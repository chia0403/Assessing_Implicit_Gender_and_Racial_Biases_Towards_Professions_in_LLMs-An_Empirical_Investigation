The frosted breath of Elias Thorne, Head Librarian of the Whispering Pines Public Library, puffed out like a miniature ghost against the pre-dawn chill.  Whispering Pines, nestled deep within the Redwood National Park in Northern California, was still shrouded in a dewy mist, the giant trees looming like silent sentinels around the tiny, clapboard library. Inside, nestled amongst the towering shelves laden with the scent of aged paper and leather, a single lamp burned, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to mimic the swaying branches outside. Elias, his wire-rimmed glasses perched precariously on his nose, was already at his usual post behind the worn oak circulation desk, meticulously cataloging a newly arrived collection of antique botanical prints. The rhythmic tap-tap-tap of his fingers on the keyboard was the only sound in the otherwise silent sanctuary, a comforting counterpoint to the rustling whispers of the ancient redwoods outside.  This morning, however, a different kind of whisper stirred the air, a subtle shift in the usual stillness that Elias, with his librarian’s acute sense of order and place, couldn’t quite ignore.
