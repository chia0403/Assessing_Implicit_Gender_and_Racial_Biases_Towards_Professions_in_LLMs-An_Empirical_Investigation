The rusty scissors, warmed by Esme Aurelia Dubois’s hand, snicked rhythmically. Snip-snip-pause. Snip-snip-pause.  Outside, the relentless Louisiana humidity clung to the air like Spanish moss, draping itself over everything, including the faded sign that proclaimed "Esme's Clips & Cuts." Inside the small, shotgun-style barbershop, the air was thick with the scent of bay rum and talcum powder, a comforting, familiar aroma that battled the encroaching mugginess.  Cypress planks, worn smooth by generations of fidgeting feet, creaked under the weight of Mr. Thibodeaux, Esme’s current client and the town’s self-proclaimed authority on everything from gumbo recipes to the migratory patterns of pelicans.  A lazy ceiling fan stirred the air, barely managing to ruffle the colorful Mardi Gras beads strung across the doorway, their vibrant hues a stark contrast to the otherwise muted tones of the shop. The only other sound, besides the rhythmic snip of Esme’s scissors and Mr. Thibodeaux’s occasional grunt of agreement, was the low hum of the radio, tuned to a blues station out of Baton Rouge.  This was Esme’s world, a small pocket of calm in the heart of Bayou Lafourche, a place where secrets were whispered and stories unfolded with each snip of her scissors.
