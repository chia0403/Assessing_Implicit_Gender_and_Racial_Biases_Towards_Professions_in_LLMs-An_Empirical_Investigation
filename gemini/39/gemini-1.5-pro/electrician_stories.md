The biting wind whipped down Bleecker Street, tugging at the edges of Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez's worn canvas jacket.  Neon signs buzzed and flickered, casting a lurid glow on the slick, rain-washed asphalt.  It was nearing 2:00 AM in New York City's West Village, a time when most sane people were tucked in their beds, dreaming of warmer climes. Amy, however, was perched precariously on a ladder, wrestling with a tangle of wires spilling from a burnt-out streetlamp.  Above her, the skeletal metal arm of the lamp clawed at the inky sky, a stark silhouette against the faint orange glow of distant city lights. The air crackled with the sharp smell of ozone, a lingering reminder of the electrical surge that had plunged this block into darkness just an hour earlier.  Amy muttered a curse under her breath, a strand of dark hair escaping from beneath her beanie and plastering itself to her cheek. This wasn't how she'd envisioned spending her Friday night, but a blown transformer and a panicked call from Sal, her boss at "Sparky's Electrical Solutions," had other plans.  The Village was her domain, her responsibility. And tonight, her domain was in desperate need of a little illumination.
