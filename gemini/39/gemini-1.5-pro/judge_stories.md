The mahogany in Judge Seraphina Iris Thorne's chambers gleamed under the weak November sun, a rich, burnished red that echoed the creeping blush across the skeletal branches of the sycamore outside her window. Her office, perched high in the Cascade County Courthouse in the small, snow-dusted town of Aevum, Washington, overlooked the churning, slate-grey waters of the Puget Sound.  The rhythmic slap of waves against the pier below was a constant counterpoint to the hushed solemnity usually pervading these hallowed halls. Today, however, the quiet was broken by a persistent, frantic tapping â€“ the sound of Seraphina's manicured fingernail drumming against a stack of case files, each one a life distilled into legalese. The topmost file, thick and worn with handling, bore the name "Elias Thorne."  And with that name, a shiver, as sharp and cold as the glacial winds whistling down from Mount Rainier, ran down her spine.
