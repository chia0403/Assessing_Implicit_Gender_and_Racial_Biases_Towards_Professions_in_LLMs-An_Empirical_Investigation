The rhythmic clatter of typewriter keys punctuated the otherwise hushed stillness of the office.  Rain lashed against the large, arched windows of the Grimshaw Building, turning the Chicago cityscape outside into a blurred watercolor of grays and blues.  Inside, bathed in the warm glow of a desk lamp, Beatrice Eleanor Higgins, secretary to Mr. Arthur Grimshaw himself, worked diligently.  It was a Friday evening, well past six o'clock, and Beatrice was alone.  The rhythmic tap-tap-tap of the keys was occasionally interspersed with the more delicate click of the carriage return lever and the gentle whir of the rolling mechanism as she fed in a fresh sheet of paper.  This was her sanctuary, this small, orderly world within the sprawling chaos of Grimshaw Industries.  Tonight, however, a strange unease prickled at the edges of her usual calm.  The building, normally a comforting presence, felt oppressive, the silence broken only by the storm and the incessant clatter of her typewriter, suddenly ominous.
