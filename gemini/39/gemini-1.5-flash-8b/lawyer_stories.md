The rain hammered against the grimy windows of the "Law & Order" office, mimicking the relentless drumming in Elias Thorne's head.

The office, a cramped space on a side street near Fleet Street, was a monument to practicality over style.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom.  Legal pads and overflowing in-trays cluttered every surface.  The aroma of stale coffee and the faint, acrid smell of burnt paper hung heavy in the air, a testament to countless hours spent poring over contracts and judgments.  Outside, the rhythmic clang of trams and the distant roar of traffic provided a constant, almost oppressive soundtrack to the relentless work.

But even his formidable reputation felt inadequate in the face of this case.  The defendant, Lord Ashworth, a titan of industry with a reputation as glittering as his vast fortune, was accused of manipulating the stock market, accusations that threatened to unravel the very foundations of the financial district.
