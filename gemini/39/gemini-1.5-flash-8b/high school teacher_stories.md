The fluorescent lights of Ms. Eleanor Vance's classroom hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of a thousand pencils on notebook paper.  History 101, a class packed with the hushed whispers of debate and the occasional frustrated sigh, felt like a suffocating blanket on a muggy summer afternoon.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun, filtering through the grimy windowpanes of the dilapidated, three-story building that housed  Northwood High.  Brick facades, once a vibrant shade of ochre, were now muted by age and neglect.  Students, bored and restless, shifted in their seats, their attention fractured between the historical accounts Ms. Vance painstakingly recited and the pull of their phones, a silent chorus of digital beeps.   Ms. Vance, with her perpetually tired eyes and a worn cardigan that had seen better days, sighed inwardly.  Another day, another lesson swallowed by the yawning chasm of adolescent apathy.  The year was 2024.
