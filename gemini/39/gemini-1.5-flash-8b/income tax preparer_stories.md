The fluorescent lights of the "Tax Relief Express" hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia Hamilton's day.  Paperclips clattered, a rhythmic percussion against the worn linoleum floor, echoing the frantic tapping of her fingers on the keyboard.  Amelia, a woman whose carefully arranged auburn hair was now a tangled nest beneath the fluorescent glare, stared at the computer screen, her brow furrowed in concentration.  Another Schedule C.

The small, cramped office, smelling faintly of stale coffee and desperation, was a microcosm of the tax season; a whirlwind of numbers, deadlines, and anxieties.  Outside, the late winter drizzle slicked the city streets, mirroring the slick, confusing financial statements Amelia was tasked with deciphering. Her meticulously organized desk, usually a testament to her meticulous nature, was now a battlefield of receipts, W-2 forms, and hastily scribbled calculations.  The clock ticked relentlessly, each second a looming reminder of the approaching deadline.

Amelia knew she had to find the solution hidden within the intricate web of his expenses and deductions.
