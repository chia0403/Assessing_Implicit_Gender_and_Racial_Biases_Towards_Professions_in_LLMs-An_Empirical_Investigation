The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual twilight blue by years of lukewarm water and forgotten lilies, reflected Elara Nightingaleâ€™s tired face.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grime-coated windowpanes of her tiny shop, "Blooms of the Bayou."  Outside, the humid Louisiana air hung heavy, thick with the scent of magnolia and the distant, insistent croak of bullfrogs.  It was a Tuesday, the slowest day of the week, and Elara, despite the floral garlands draped across the shelves, felt a profound sense of emptiness.  The shop, nestled in the heart of the crumbling French Quarter, was a haven of vibrant color, yet Elara felt a dull ache, a void that no bouquet of peonies or cascading roses could fill.  A single, wilting jasmine blossom lay abandoned on the countertop, a poignant symbol of her own fading spirit.
