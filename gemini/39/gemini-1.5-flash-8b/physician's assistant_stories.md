The antiseptic tang of bleach and disinfectant hung heavy in the air, a familiar shroud draped over the emergency room.  Rain hammered against the stained-glass windows of St. Jude's, mimicking the frantic rhythm of Dr. Anya Petrova's own heartbeat.  Anya, a physician's assistant with eyes the color of stormy seas and a perpetually tired smile, leaned over the gurney.  The young man, barely twenty, lay still, his chest rising and falling with a labored, shallow sigh.  The rhythmic beeping of monitors formed a counterpoint to the hushed whispers of the nurses and the anxious murmurs of concerned relatives.  Anya knew this scene, this frantic dance of life and death, all too well.


The emergency room of St. Jude's Hospital, a sprawling, century-old building overlooking the bustling city of Veridian, was a microcosm of the human condition.  The fluorescent lights hummed, casting an almost sterile glow over the chaotic landscape of medical equipment, overflowing paperwork, and the ever-present tension of impending diagnoses.  The heavy, oak doors, scarred with the marks of countless emergencies, provided a silent testament to the relentless stream of patients that poured through its threshold, each bearing a unique story of pain, fear, and hope.  This particular evening, however, felt different.  Something about the young man's stillness, about the way his family held each other, felt... heavier.
