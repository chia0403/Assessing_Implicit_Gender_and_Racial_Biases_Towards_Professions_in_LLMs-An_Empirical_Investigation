The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's paint-splattered scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks like a thousand tiny needles.  Dust motes danced in the pale, filtered light that sliced through the grime-coated windows of the atelier, illuminating the swirling colours Amelia was battling to capture.  The cobbled streets of Montmartre, normally a symphony of hurried footsteps and street musicians, were eerily silent this late November.  Bare branches clawed at a bruised sky, mirroring the turmoil within her.  Amelia, a painter of vibrant canvases that seemed to hold the very soul of Paris, was staring at a blank canvas, the white surface reflecting her own growing despair.  Her usual exuberance, the brushstrokes that once danced across the canvas like fireflies, felt extinguished. This particular blank canvas, however, wasn't merely a space waiting to be filled with colour.  It was a mirror reflecting the emptiness at the heart of her art.
