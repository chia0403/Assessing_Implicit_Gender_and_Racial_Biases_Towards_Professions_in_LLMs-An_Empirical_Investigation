The chipped porcelain sink in Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's barbershop, "The Snip-Snap,"  reflected the afternoon sun, casting a warm, hazy glow over the dust motes dancing in the air.  The scent of freshly cut hair – a heady mix of lavender, rosemary, and a faint trace of something vaguely medicinal – hung heavy in the air.  Outside, the midday heat pressed down on the cobbled streets of Alderbrook, a town clinging to the ancient hillside, where time seemed to have slowed to a whisper.  Ivy, thick and emerald green, snaked its way up the walls of the buildings, almost obscuring the weathered stonework.  Barty, a man with eyes the colour of polished mahogany and hands that had seen countless heads transformed, leaned over the sink, meticulously applying aftershave to his newest client.
