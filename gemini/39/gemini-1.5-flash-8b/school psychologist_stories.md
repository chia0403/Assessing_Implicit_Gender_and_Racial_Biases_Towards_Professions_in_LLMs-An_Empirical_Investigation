Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the dilapidated school building, a relentless percussion that mirrored the anxieties swirling inside Dr. Eleanor Vance's mind.  The air hung thick with the scent of mildew and despair, a familiar aroma in the halls of Oakhaven High.  It was a Tuesday, a day she’d dread more than any other, because Tuesday was when the after-school support groups were scheduled.  This particular Tuesday, however, felt different, an ominous undercurrent of unease pushing against the usual, heavy weight of teenage angst.

The chipped linoleum floor, speckled with faded crayon marks and the ghostly remnants of spilled drinks, stretched before her.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom from a broken window high above.  Beyond the peeling paint and cracked plaster, the skeletal remains of a once-vibrant school – once the pride of the small, struggling town – whispered tales of neglect and forgotten promises.  Oakhaven High, a testament to its surrounding community's struggles, was a place of profound, palpable despair.  Eleanor knew it well, perhaps too well.
