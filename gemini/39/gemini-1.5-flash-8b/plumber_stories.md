The flickering neon sign of "Gutter Glory Plumbing" cast a sickly yellow glow on Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's rain-slicked overalls.  He scrubbed at a stubborn clog in the overflowing drainpipe, the putrid stench of sewage rising in a nauseating wave.  This wasn't your typical Friday night.  Not only was the rain lashing against the corrugated iron of the old Victorian building, making the whole alley a deafening symphony of water, but the clog was *extraordinarily* stubborn.  Bartyâ€™s wrench felt like a lead weight in his hand.  A rat scurried past his boot, its beady eyes reflecting the flickering light.  The alley, usually a haven of shadowy figures and whispered secrets, was eerily quiet, broken only by the relentless drumming of the storm.

This was the back alley of  Old Ashworth, a district steeped in history and whispered legends, a place where the cobblestones seemed to hold the echoes of forgotten times.  The Victorian architecture, with its ornate gables and decaying plaster, seemed to lean into the downpour, as if trying to protect some unseen secret from the storm.  Barty, at 32 years old, had grown up in these very streets, knew every rusted pipe and hidden sewer vent by heart.  Gutter Glory, his small, family-run plumbing business, was the heart of this neighborhood, a testament to his father's legacy and a beacon of hope in the face of rising water levels and clogged drains.  But tonight, even Barty felt a chill run down his spine.  Something felt...off.
