The biting wind whipped through the gaps in the weathered stone walls of the Blackwood Manor, rattling the ancient, oak-paneled doors.  Inside, Amelia Blackwood, a meticulous animal caretaker with eyes the colour of polished amber and a heart overflowing with empathy, meticulously arranged a small, woven basket filled with plump, juicy berries.  The scent of pine needles and damp earth hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort in the stark, gothic surroundings. Blackwood Manor, a sprawling estate nestled deep within the whispering forests of the Black Downs, had been her sanctuary, her domain, for twenty years.  Her charge – a menagerie of creatures both fantastical and mundane – was her lifeblood.  From the emerald-scaled Iridium lizards to the wise, ancient griffins nestled in their high perches, Amelia knew each creature's rhythm, each unique need.  The manor itself felt alive with their presence, a symphony of chirps, croaks, and soft purrs echoing through the vast halls. Today, however, a different sort of unease clung to the air. The usually harmonious sounds were muted, replaced by an unnerving quiet.
