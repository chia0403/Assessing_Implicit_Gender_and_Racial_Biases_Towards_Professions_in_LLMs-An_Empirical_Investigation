Rain lashed against the windows of the "Nourish & Thrive" clinic, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Amelia Hawthorne, Registered Dietitian.  The fluorescent lights hummed, a sterile counterpoint to the frantic rhythm of her thoughts.  Amelia, a woman whose meticulously organized life revolved around precise portion sizes and balanced macronutrients, was facing a client crisis of epic proportions.  

The setting was a small, but meticulously maintained, clinic nestled in the heart of a bustling, yet somehow perpetually grey, coastal town.  Ocean mist clung to the air, carrying the salty tang of the nearby Atlantic, a constant reminder of the raw, unforgiving beauty that existed just beyond the sterile walls.  The clinic itself, with its muted blues and greens, intended to evoke a sense of calm, was currently vibrating with a palpable anxiety.  Ameliaâ€™s meticulously arranged labels on shelves, neatly stacked nutritional supplements, and gleaming stainless steel equipment were all overshadowed by the tension in the air.  Outside, waves crashed against the rocky shore, a relentless symphony accompanying the growing unease within the clinic's small, yet carefully designed, waiting room.
