The flickering neon sign of the "Rusty Spoon" cast a sickly yellow glow over Amelia Nightingale's worn leather jacket.  Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof, mimicking the frantic rhythm of her own heart.  Below, the cobbled streets of Port Haven, a town clinging precariously to the cliffs overlooking the churning grey sea, swallowed the sound of her music.  Amelia, a singer with eyes the colour of storm clouds and a voice like a tempestuous sea, huddled deeper into her worn coat, the cold seeping into her bones.  Tonight, the "Rusty Spoon" was emptier than usual, the only patrons a lone fisherman staring out at the turbulent water and a woman knitting furiously by the fire, her face hidden in shadow.  It was a dismal night, and Amelia felt the weight of her failing career pressing down on her like the encroaching tide.  Her latest album, "Whispers of the Waves," had barely made a ripple, the echoes of her once-vibrant performances now fading into the melancholy soundtrack of her existence.
