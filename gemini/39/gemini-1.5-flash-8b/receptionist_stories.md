The chipped Formica countertop gleamed under the harsh fluorescent lights of the "Apex Architectural Designs" reception area.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grimy window, illuminating a miniature jungle of overly-enthusiastic, plastic plants.  Amelia  Seraphina Blackwood, perched behind a desk overflowing with architectural renderings and half-eaten takeout containers, sighed. Another Tuesday. Another endless parade of clients, each more demanding and less interested in the actual blueprints than in the latest gossip about the CEO's divorce proceedings.


The setting was a small, uninspired office building on the edge of the city, a concrete box swallowed by a sea of aging skyscrapers.  The air, thick with the smell of stale coffee and cheap air freshener, hung heavy with unspoken anxieties and the low hum of fluorescent lights.  Amelia, a woman of quiet strength and a perpetually weary smile, felt like she was drowning in the relentless flow of paperwork and the cacophony of conversations about the latest property developments.  This was her reality: a soul-crushing but necessary job in the heart of the concrete jungle, where she was just a nameless face amongst a sea of ambition.
