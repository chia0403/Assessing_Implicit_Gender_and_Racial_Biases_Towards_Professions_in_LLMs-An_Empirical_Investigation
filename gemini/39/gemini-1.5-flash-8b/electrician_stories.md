The flickering fluorescent lights of the abandoned warehouse hummed a mournful tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* of Bartholomew "Barty"  Fitzwilliam's hammer against the rusted metal conduit.  Dust motes, like tiny, spectral dancers, swirled in the pale shafts of light piercing the gloom.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic pace of Barty's work.  He was a man forged in the crucible of late-night repairs and dawn-to-dusk deadlines, his calloused hands the testament to years spent wrestling with electrical currents.  This particular warehouse, once a hub of bustling industry, now stood as a stark monument to forgotten dreams and shattered ambitions.  Barty was the only witness to its slow, quiet decay.  He was its last electrician.
