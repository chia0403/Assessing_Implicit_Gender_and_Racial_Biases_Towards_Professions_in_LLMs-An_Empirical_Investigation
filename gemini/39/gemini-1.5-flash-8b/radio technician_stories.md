The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Coil" cast a sickly yellow glow on Amelia Petrova's face as she crouched beneath the workbench.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light piercing the greasy gloom of the repair shop.  The air, thick with the smell of solder and ozone, tasted metallic and faintly acrid.  Amelia, a radio technician with a constellation of calluses across her palms and a spirit as resilient as the ancient vacuum tubes she meticulously repaired, traced the frayed wires with a pair of needle-nose pliers.

The setting: A cramped, cluttered repair shop nestled in the back alleys of a sprawling, rain-slicked city called Veridia.  Rust-eaten metal and chipped paint adorned the walls, while tangled wires snaked across the room like restless serpents.  A vintage gramophone, its horn pointing towards the dusty ceiling, sat forgotten in a corner.  The rhythmic whir of machinery, punctuated by the sporadic crackle of static, was the shop's constant soundtrack.  Veridia itself was a sprawling metropolis built on the remnants of forgotten radio towers and communications networks, a place where whispers of lost signals still echoed through the forgotten corridors of power.  Old stories, like faint echoes, were embedded in the very fabric of the city.
