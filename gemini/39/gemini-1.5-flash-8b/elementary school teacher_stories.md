The chipped paint of the chalkboard, a faded, almost-forgotten mural of dinosaurs, stared back at Amelia Blackwood.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight piercing the gloom of the third-grade classroom.

The air, thick with the scent of crayons and vaguely suspicious snacks, hummed with the low, rhythmic thrum of anticipation.  Today was the day.  Today they were finally going to write their epic stories about the lost city of Eldoria.

A chipped globe, stubbornly refusing to stay upright, dominated a corner, while a worn, stuffed badger, known as Professor Barnaby, held court on a bookshelf, an unofficial mascot for the students.  The whole room, in its imperfect glory, seemed to vibrate with the unique energy of a hundred young imaginations.
