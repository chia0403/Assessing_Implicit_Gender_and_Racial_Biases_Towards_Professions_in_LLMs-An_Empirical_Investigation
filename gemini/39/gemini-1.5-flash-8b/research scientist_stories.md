The fluorescent hum of the lab, a constant, low thrumming like a restless heart, vibrated through Dr. Elara Vance's bones.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight piercing the grime-coated window of her research lab, illuminating microscopic flecks of what she hoped was the key to understanding the bioluminescent algae of the Xylos system.  Her lab, nestled within the sprawling, grey concrete expanse of the Kepler-186f research facility, was a testament to both meticulous organization and the relentless pursuit of the unknown.  Rows of precisely arranged test tubes, each containing a sample of algae meticulously harvested from the Xylos systemâ€™s alien oceans, lined the benches.  Empty coffee cups and crumpled research papers littered the work surfaces, silent witnesses to countless late nights and failed experiments.  Elara, hunched over a microscope, adjusted the focus, her brow furrowed in concentration.  The faint, otherworldly glow emanating from the algae in the sample beneath the lens was the only light source in this small, almost claustrophobic, space.
