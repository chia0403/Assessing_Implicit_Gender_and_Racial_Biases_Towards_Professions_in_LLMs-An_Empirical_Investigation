The fluorescent lights of the "Corner Mart" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's Tuesday night.  Dust motes danced in the shafts of pale yellow light, mirroring the swirling thoughts in Amy's head.  Rain hammered against the corrugated metal awning, a relentless percussion against the already cacophonous clatter of shopping carts and the rhythmic *ping* of the cash register.  It was a Tuesday night, and the Corner Mart was packed with families grabbing last-minute supplies before the week's end.  The air hung thick with the smells of stale bread, cheap coffee, and the indefinable aroma of a community store that had seen better days.

Amy, with her perpetually tired eyes and a cardigan that had seen far too many spills, punched in the code for the twenty-third carton of milk.  She was a creature of habit, her fingers dancing across the keys in a practiced ballet.  The store was her cage, and the shoppers her audience. She knew every regular by name, or at least by their preferred brand of chips and the weary sigh they uttered as they reached for the same old lottery ticket.
