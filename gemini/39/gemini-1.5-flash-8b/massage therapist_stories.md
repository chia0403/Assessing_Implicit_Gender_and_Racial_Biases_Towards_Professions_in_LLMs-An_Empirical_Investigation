Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Willow Creek Massage, a small, almost hidden establishment tucked between a butcher shop and a dilapidated hardware store.  The rhythmic drumming echoed the steady, rhythmic kneading of Amelia “Ames” Blackwood's hands as she worked on a client.  The scent of lavender oil, mingled with the faint, earthy aroma of damp earth, hung heavy in the air.  Inside, the only other light came from a single bare bulb hanging precariously from the ceiling, casting long, dancing shadows across the worn wooden floor.  Ames, a woman with eyes the color of storm clouds and hands as strong as oak, focused intently on the tension knot residing in her client's back.  Outside, the relentless rain continued its relentless assault. This was a night for deep work, both literally and figuratively.
