The chipped paint of the workshop door, a faded ochre that clung stubbornly to the wood like dried blood, groaned open under Elias Thorne's touch.  Dust motes, illuminated by the afternoon sun slanting through the grime-streaked windowpanes, danced in the air, swirling around the sawdust-strewn floor.  Elias, a carpenter of the old school, his hands weathered like aged leather, felt the familiar thrum of the work begin.  Not the thrum of machinery, but the quiet, persistent pulse of wood meeting tool, the soft, satisfying sigh of wood giving way to his will.  The scent of pine and linseed oil hung heavy in the air, a comforting balm to his weary soul.  The workshop, nestled in the shadow of the towering, wind-swept cliffs of Blackwood, was his sanctuary.  Every board, every nail, every knot, spoke a language only he understood, a language of stories carved in timber, of lives built and lives lived, of futures yet to be shaped.  The rhythmic tap-tap-tap of his chisel against the wood was a counterpoint to the mournful cry of seagulls circling high above.  He was Elias Thorne, and today, the whisper of a new project had stirred in the depths of his heart.
