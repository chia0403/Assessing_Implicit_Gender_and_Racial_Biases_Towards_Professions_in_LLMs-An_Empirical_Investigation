The chipped Formica counter, stained a dull beige from years of spilled coffee and lukewarm lattes, reflected the fluorescent hum of the office above.  Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of "Reliable Repairs," a shop more accurately described as a haven for forgotten electronics and half-heartedly-maintained appliances.  This was the domain of  Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, a salesperson whose charm was as finely tuned as his ability to persuade a dying toaster to accept another day of service.  Barty, a man who could make a broken blender sound almost appealing, surveyed the room.  A vintage record player sat forlornly in one corner, its gleaming, brass tonearm askew, like a wilting dancer.  A stack of dusty, cracked CD cases leaned precariously against a chipped ceramic sink.  And in the center of the room, a surprisingly large, antique-looking radio, humming softly, pulsed with a quiet, persistent energy.  Barty, clad in his usual pressed khakis and a slightly too-bright orange polo shirt, knew that this radio held the key to a sale that could possibly rescue the shop from its slow, quiet death.
