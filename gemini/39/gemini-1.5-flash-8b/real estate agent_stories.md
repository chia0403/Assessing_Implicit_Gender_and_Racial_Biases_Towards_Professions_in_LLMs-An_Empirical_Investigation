Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the "The Broker's Den," the flickering fluorescent lights casting long, distorted shadows across Amelia “Amy” Cartwright's cluttered desk.  The scent of stale coffee and desperation hung thick in the air, a familiar aroma in the small, unassuming office nestled in the heart of the perpetually down-on-its-luck district of Ashwood.  Empty coffee cups, crumpled napkins, and a half-eaten bag of pretzels littered the surface.  Amy, a woman of thirty-five with perpetually tired eyes and a practiced smile, stared at the latest property listing: a dilapidated Victorian house on Elm Street, its once-proud façade now scarred with peeling paint and broken windows.  A "For Sale" sign, barely visible through the deluge, was the only beacon of hope, or despair, depending on one's perspective. Ashwood, once a vibrant hub of the city, was now a ghost town, its residents lured away by the promise of better prospects elsewhere. Amy, however, was a creature of habit, a tenacious, resilient Ashwood native.  She'd seen this neighborhood rise and fall, and she refused to let it die completely in her hands.
