The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the cobblestones of Grosvenor Square, illuminating the ornate facade of the Grand Cavendish Hotel.  Rain, a relentless, icy curtain, hammered against the polished brass door handles. Inside, amidst the hushed whispers and clinking of silverware, a young man named  Jasper Ashworth, bellhop extraordinaire at the Grand Cavendish, meticulously polished a brass tray.  Each stroke of his chamois, with the practiced grace of a seasoned craftsman, seemed to quiet the echoing anxieties of the storm outside.  Jasper, barely twenty-two, possessed a quiet intensity, his brow perpetually furrowed in concentration, his eyes reflecting the polished gleam of the metal under his care.  He felt more at home within the confines of this grand establishment, with its soaring ceilings and echoing hallways, than in the cramped, soot-filled backstreets of the city.  The Grand Cavendish, a monument to opulence and gilded age, was his sanctuary, a place where the thunderous roar of the metropolis outside faded to a distant murmur.
