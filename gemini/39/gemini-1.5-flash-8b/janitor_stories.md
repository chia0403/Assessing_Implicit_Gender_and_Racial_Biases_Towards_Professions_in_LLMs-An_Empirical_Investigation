The fluorescent hum of the museum echoed around Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, a man whose life, like the dust motes dancing in the single shaft of afternoon light, existed mostly on the periphery.  Barty, custodian of the magnificent, yet oddly melancholic,  Metropolitan Museum of the Lost Civilizations, surveyed his domain.  Empty display cases, lined with faded velvet, reflected the afternoon sun like polished graves.  A faint, musty scent of aged papyrus and forgotten secrets hung heavy in the air, a constant companion to Barty's solitary existence. The museum, a sprawling, gothic structure carved from grey stone, stood perched on a hill overlooking the bustling city below.  Autumn leaves, a kaleidoscope of fiery reds and golds, clung to the ancient walls, as if whispering tales of vanished empires.   Barty, wearing his faded blue uniform, felt a familiar twinge of quiet sorrow. Another day, another silent vigil amongst the echoes of history.
