The chipped paint of the "Grand Majestic" theatre, a monument to a bygone era of extravagant productions and even more extravagant hats, clung to the walls like faded memories.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight piercing the gloom of the empty auditorium, illuminating a single figure, Isolde Amelia Hawthorne, director of the Grand Majestic.  Her silver-streaked hair, a halo of defiance against the sepia-toned interior, was pulled back in a severe bun.  Her sharp eyes, usually twinkling with theatrical brilliance, were narrowed in concentration as she paced the faded crimson carpet, a worn copy of "A Midsummer Night's Dream" clutched in her hand.  The theatre, once a vibrant heart of the city's social life, now whispered with the ghosts of forgotten applause and the chilling sigh of the empty seats.  Outside, the city of Ashwood thrummed with a restless energy, oblivious to the silent struggle unfolding within its relic of a theatre.
