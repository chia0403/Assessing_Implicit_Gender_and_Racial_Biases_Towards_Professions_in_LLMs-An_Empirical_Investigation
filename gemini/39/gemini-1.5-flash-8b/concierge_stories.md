The rain hammered against the ornate copper roof of the Grand Astor Hotel, a rhythmic percussion that echoed the frantic beat of Elara Nightingale's heart.  Her hands, usually so deft at arranging bouquets and orchestrating smooth guest experiences, trembled as she traced the chipped paint on the antique mahogany desk.  It was the anniversary of the hotel's infamous fire, a tragedy that had cast a long shadow over the Gilded Age grandeur of the building, a legacy Elara felt a profound responsibility to uphold. Tonight, however, the grand hotel felt more like a mausoleum, hushed and expectant, the whispers of the past swirling around her like damp autumn leaves.  The city outside, normally vibrant with late-night activity, was a muted grey, mirroring the heavy mood within the vast lobby.  Elara, a Concierge at the Grand Astor for the past ten years, was alone, save for the spectral glow of the flickering gas lamps and the silent, watchful eyes of the hotelâ€™s aged portraits.
