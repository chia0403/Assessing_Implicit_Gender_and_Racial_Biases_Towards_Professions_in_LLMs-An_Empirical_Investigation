Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless percussion that seemed to mirror the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Bartyâ€™s own heart.  He was a man of habit, a creature of routine, and the life of the Rusty Mug, a haven for the down-and-out and the lost, was as predictable as the sunrise. Tonight, however, a new face stirred the familiar brew.
