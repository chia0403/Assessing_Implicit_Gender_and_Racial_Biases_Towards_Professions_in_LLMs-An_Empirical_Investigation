The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine and something vaguely metallic, likely the overflowing dumpster behind the yoga studio.  Rain threatened, but the oppressive heat held its breath, promising a downpour that would only make the already sticky asphalt feel more like a sauna.  This was Maya Chandra's happy place, or at least, it was supposed to be.  Right now, however, the gleaming hardwood floors and brightly coloured exercise equipment felt more like a pressure cooker, threatening to explode with pent-up frustrations.

Maya Chandra, a certified personal trainer with a perpetually optimistic smile that today felt strained, surveyed her class of eight.  Four were diligently attempting a series of plank variations, another was struggling to maintain their balance during a warrior pose, and the remaining three – a trio of middle-aged women nicknamed "The Three Musketeers" by Maya – were engaged in an intense, surprisingly graceful, dance-off, seemingly oblivious to Maya's mounting anxiety.

Setting: A brightly lit, airy yoga studio in a bustling, somewhat trendy, section of a vibrant Southeast Asian city.  The studio's windows overlooked a narrow street teeming with scooters and hawkers, the cacophony of the city blending seamlessly with the quiet focus of Maya's class.  Though sleek and modern, the space was infused with a touch of exotic flair, with intricate wall decor and plants thriving in the indoor jungle-like environment.
