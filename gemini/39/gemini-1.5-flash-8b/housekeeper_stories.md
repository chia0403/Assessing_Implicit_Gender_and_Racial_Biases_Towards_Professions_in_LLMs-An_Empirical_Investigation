The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual twilight grey, reflected Amelia Peabody's tired face.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom of the sprawling, Victorian mansion, Blackwood Manor.  Rain lashed against the leaded-glass windows, a relentless percussion that echoed the tremor in her weary bones.  Amelia, housekeeper for the enigmatic Blackwood family, ran a hand over the worn floral wallpaper, tracing patterns that seemed to writhe and sigh with the oppressive silence of the house.  It had been this way for weeks now.  An unsettling stillness, deeper than the usual gothic quiet Blackwood Manor was known for.  

Blackwood Manor, nestled deep within the misty, emerald valleys of the Derbyshire Peak District, was a monument to melancholy grandeur.  Gothic turrets pierced the bruised sky, and the imposing stone walls seemed to whisper tales of forgotten tragedies and whispered secrets.  Jagged peaks framed the property, mirroring the sharp angles of the house itself, while the mist clung to the valley floor like a shroud.  A chill, colder than the autumn air, permeated the house, settling deep in the bones and whispering of things unseen.  The vast rooms, once brimming with laughter and light, now echoed with the ghosts of their former inhabitants, whispering tales of faded fortunes and lost love.
