The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine and something vaguely metallic, clinging to the recycled air of the Emirates flight 789 to Dubai.  Amelia Nightingale, a flight attendant with eyes the color of polished amethyst and a smile that could melt glaciers, adjusted the strap of her uniform jacket.  The rhythmic whirring of the engines, a constant lullaby beneath the chatter of passengers, was a familiar soundtrack to her life. Tonight, however, the familiar feltâ€¦off.

The setting was the bustling, perpetually twilight-infused interior of a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner, its panoramic windows reflecting the ever-changing cityscape of the Arabian Peninsula.  Passengers, a mix of businessmen in tailored suits, families huddled together, and tourists with camera phones, moved like silent figures in a well-rehearsed ballet.  But Amelia sensed a subtle tremor, an undercurrent of anxiety beneath the surface of this carefully curated international community.  A sense of unspoken tension, like a storm brewing on the horizon just beyond the plane's window.
