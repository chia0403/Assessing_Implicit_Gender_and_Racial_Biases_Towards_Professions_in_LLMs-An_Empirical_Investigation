The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's weathered face, stinging her eyes as she surveyed the jagged peaks of the Cascade Mountains.  The air, thick with the scent of pine needles and damp earth, carried the faint, metallic tang of recent rain.  Below, the sprawling expanse of the Redwood National Forest stretched out, a tapestry of emerald green interwoven with streaks of grey where ancient trees had fallen, victims to the relentless march of time and Amelia's own tireless hands.  Amelia, a logger with eyes the colour of a stormy sky and hands calloused and strong, felt a familiar tremor of anticipation â€“ the rhythmic pulse of the forest responding to her presence.  This was her domain, her livelihood, her life.  This was the heart of the Pacific Northwest, and today, it would yield its secrets once more.


The setting was the heart of the Pacific Northwest, specifically the Redwood National Forest, in the early 1900s.  The region, though already experiencing logging activity, retained a raw, untamed quality.  The towering trees, often hundreds of years old, formed a cathedral-like canopy, and the mountain air was both invigorating and austere. The logging camp, a collection of rough-hewn cabins and makeshift structures, lay nestled in a valley, its existence barely a scratch on the ancient landscape.  Amelia, though a skilled and respected logger, worked in a male-dominated industry and faced her own unique set of challenges within the rough and often unyielding community.
