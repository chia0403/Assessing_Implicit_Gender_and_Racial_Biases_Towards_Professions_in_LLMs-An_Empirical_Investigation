The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks as she surveyed the skeletal remains of the old mill.  Grey, skeletal fingers of rain clawed at the crumbling brick, mirroring the gnawing anxieties that had settled in her stomach since sheâ€™d arrived in the isolated village of Oakhaven. Amelia Blackwood, architect extraordinaire and daughter of a renowned structural engineer, found herself, for the first time in her career, overwhelmed.  Not by the sheer scale of the project, which involved restoring the mill into a community center, but by the sheer weight of the village's history and the whispers that followed her wherever she went.  Oakhaven, nestled deep within the rolling hills of the Derbyshire Dales, held a secret, and Amelia, with her sharp eye for detail and insatiable curiosity, was determined to uncover it.  The rusted gates of the mill, twisted and broken, creaked open with a groan, beckoning her forward into the heart of the storm. Inside, the air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and forgotten memories, a symphony of silence punctuated only by the mournful drip, drip, drip of water seeping from the roof. The village itself, a cluster of quaint, weathered cottages clinging to the hillside, seemed to hold its breath, watching her every move.
