The chipped Formica countertop, stained a dull beige from years of spilled coffee and sticky receipts, reflected the flickering fluorescent lights of the "Reliable Records" office.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grime-coated window.  Amelia Cavendish, bookkeeper extraordinaire, or perhaps more accurately, bookkeeper *extraordinaire-ordinaire* (a title she bestowed upon herself with quiet satisfaction), adjusted her thick glasses.  The rhythmic *click-clack* of her trusty mechanical calculator, a relic from the 1980s, punctuated the otherwise hushed atmosphere.  Outside, the city of Veridian hummed, oblivious to the meticulous dance of numbers unfolding within the cramped office.

Amelia Cavendish, 42 years old and possessing an encyclopedic knowledge of debits and credits, was not merely a bookkeeper.  She was the guardian of Veridian's financial soul, the quiet architect of its daily transactions.  Within these walls, where the air tasted of stale coffee and desperation (and a touch of old-fashioned floral perfume, a vestige of her own meticulous morning routine), lay the delicate tapestry of Veridian's financial heartbeat.  A misplaced decimal could trigger a cascade of errors, disrupting the delicate balance of the entire city.  Amelia, however, held the thread firmly.  Today, however, a tiny knot in the fabric of her meticulous calculations felt...out of place.
