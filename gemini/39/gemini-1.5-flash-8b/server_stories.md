The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow over the rain-slicked cobblestones, reflecting in the puddles like shattered mirrors.  Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of stale beer, cinnamon, and something vaguely floral, likely from the poorly-maintained potted jasmine clinging to life on the windowsills.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless percussion that drowned out the low hum of conversation and the clinking of glasses.  This was a Tuesday night, and a particularly dreary one at that, in the shadowed heart of Havenwood.

Elara Nightingale, a server with a perpetually tired smile and hands that looked like they'd wrestled with too many chipped mugs, wiped down a sticky table.  Her black hair, usually pulled back in a tight bun, was escaping in loose tendrils that clung to her forehead, a testament to the night's damp chill.  The chipped porcelain of the mug in her hand felt strangely warm against her palms.  This wasn't the first time she'd experienced this unnerving warmth.
