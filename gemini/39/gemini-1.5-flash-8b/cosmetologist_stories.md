The humid air hung thick and heavy in the salon, a suffocating blanket woven from the scent of lavender shampoo, burnt sugar hairspray, and the faint, metallic tang of someone’s fear.  Sunlight, fractured by the grimy windowpanes, cast long, distorted shadows across the polished floors.  This was Seraphina "Sera" Nightingale's domain, a tiny, but stubbornly independent, salon tucked away on a side street in the heart of the bustling, yet decaying, city of Ashwood.  Sera, a cosmetologist with hands that moved with the grace of a hummingbird and eyes that held the depth of a forgotten forest, was immersed in her latest creation: a vibrant, sunset-hued ombre that wound its way down the length of her client’s ebony hair.  The client, a quiet, reserved woman named Elara Vance, sat patiently, her gaze fixed on a chipped teacup that sat on the small, ornate table beside her.  It was a typical Wednesday afternoon, yet Sera felt an unusual sense of unease, a prickling sensation that settled low in her stomach.  The air felt charged, heavy with something unseen, something she couldn't quite name.
