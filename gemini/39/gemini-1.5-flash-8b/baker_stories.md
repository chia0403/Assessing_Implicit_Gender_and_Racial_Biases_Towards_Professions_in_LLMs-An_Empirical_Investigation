The aroma of cinnamon and freshly baked sourdough hung heavy in the air, clinging to the chipped paint of the bakery, "The Golden Crust."  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grime-streaked windowpane, illuminating a flurry of flour-dusted aprons and the frantic rhythm of  Amelia "Amy"  Butterworth's nimble hands.  Amy, a baker with eyes the colour of warm honey and a smile that could melt glacial ice, was in her element.  But today, even the intoxicating scent of her signature pain au chocolat seemed to carry an undercurrent of unease. The bakery, usually bustling with the chatter of regulars, was strangely quiet.  Just the rhythmic whir of the old Hobart mixer, a constant companion, and the occasional, almost imperceptible, tapping sound from the back room.

The Golden Crust sat nestled on a cobbled street in the heart of Old Southwark, London, a district steeped in history and shrouded in shadows.  The building itself felt ancient, its stone walls whispering tales of past generations, echoing with echoes of the river Thames that flowed not far from its edge.  Grey clouds hung low, hinting at a downpour that always seemed to accompany the unsettling stillness.  This was no ordinary day in the bakery.  Today, a peculiar hush had fallen over the normally vibrant district, a silence so profound it threatened to swallow the city whole.
