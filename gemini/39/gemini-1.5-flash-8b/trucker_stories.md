The biting wind whipped at the cab of the semi, a relentless, icy claw clawing at the already frayed edges of Silas Blackwood's patience.  Snow, thick and blinding, coated the vast, empty expanse of the I-90 corridor, blurring the already indistinct horizon into a featureless white.  Silas, his knuckles white around the worn steering wheel, squinted against the blizzard, his breath fogging the windshield in a swirling cloud of icy steam.  He was hours from the next town,  miles from help, and desperately, agonizingly, hungry.  The diner in Harmony Creek, a fleeting memory of warm grease and comforting smells, receded further into the gloom with each agonizingly slow mile.


**Setting:** The desolate I-90 corridor, somewhere in the northern plains states, during a brutal winter blizzard.
