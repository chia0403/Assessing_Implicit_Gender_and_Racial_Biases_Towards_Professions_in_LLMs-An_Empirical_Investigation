The biting wind whipped rain-slicked streets into a frenzy, mirroring the turmoil churning within Detective Isabella "Izzy" Rodriguez.  The neon glow of the "24/7 Diner" cast a sickly yellow pallor over the otherwise muted hues of the city's impoverished Eastside.  Rain hammered against the corrugated metal awning, a relentless percussion against the din of the city's ceaseless hum.  Izzy, a seasoned LAPD officer with a face etched with more than a few sleepless nights, hunched deeper into her worn leather coat.  The flickering fluorescent lights of the diner cast long, dancing shadows on the rain-streaked pavement, creating an eerie atmosphere that matched the gravity of the case.  Tonight, a young woman, barely a teenager, had been found dead in an alley behind the diner, her body shrouded in an impenetrable silence.  The alley, barely more than a forgotten space between decaying warehouses and looming apartment buildings, reeked of stale beer and desperation.  Izzy had seen it all in her years on the force, but this… this felt different.  It felt personal.  It felt… wrong.
