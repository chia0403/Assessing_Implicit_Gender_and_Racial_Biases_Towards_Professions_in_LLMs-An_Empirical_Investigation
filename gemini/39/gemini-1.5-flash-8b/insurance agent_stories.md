Rain lashed against the plate glass windows of the "Emerald City Insurance" office, blurring the already-dim afternoon light.  A lone figure, Elara Nightingale, hunched over a stack of claim forms, the fluorescent lights reflecting harshly off her spectacles.  The office, located on the fifth floor of a nondescript downtown skyscraper, hummed with the low thrum of the city, a counterpoint to the rhythmic click-clack of Elara's pen.  Dust motes danced in the air, obscuring the city skyline visible through the rain-streaked panes.  Today, the relentless downpour mirrored the deluge of paperwork on her desk:  claims for flood damage, fire damage, everything from a broken sprinkler head to a completely destroyed vintage bookstore.  Elara, a third-generation insurance agent with a worn leather portfolio and a quiet determination, knew this was just another Tuesday.
