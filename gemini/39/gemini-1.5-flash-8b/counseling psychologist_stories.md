The flickering fluorescent lights of the waiting room hummed, a monotonous counterpoint to the rhythmic tapping of Dr. Eleanor Vance's pen on her notepad.  Outside, the relentless autumn rain hammered against the windows of the small, somewhat dilapidated, counseling practice on the outskirts of the city.  Rain-streaked reflections danced across the worn linoleum floor, mirroring the storm brewing within the young woman seated across from her.  Eleanor, her own anxieties usually well-contained, felt a familiar knot tighten in her stomach.  This was a case unlike any she'd encountered.

The setting was the muted, beige-walled office, a far cry from the bustling, vibrant heart of the city.  A single, slightly lopsided potted fern, its leaves stubbornly green despite the dreary weather, stood on a small table beside Eleanorâ€™s desk.  The room itself was functional, but lacked the warmth or comforting aura many clients expected from a counseling space.  A faint scent of old paper and disinfectant hung heavy in the air. This was her quiet sanctuary, a refuge from the world she often found herself in the midst of.  The rain, mirroring the unspoken turmoil she knew resided within her client, seemed to be a constant, almost omnipresent presence.  The appointment book, with its meticulously filled schedule, represented the lives she navigated, trying to help each in their own unique storms.
