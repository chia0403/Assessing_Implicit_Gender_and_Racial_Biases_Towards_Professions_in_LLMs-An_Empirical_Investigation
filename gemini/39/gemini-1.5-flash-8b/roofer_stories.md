The biting wind, a relentless, icy claw, ripped at Silas Blackwood's worn leather jacket as he surveyed the crumbling Victorian mansion from his precarious perch atop the roof.  Rain, in sheets, hammered against the corrugated iron, mimicking the frantic drumming in his ears.  Below, the cobbled street of Whisperwind, usually a vibrant tapestry of autumnal colours, was now a grey, sludgy canvas.  The mansion, a looming silhouette against the bruised sky, was a monument to neglect, its once-proud facade scarred by time and weather, its many gables like the jagged teeth of a beast preparing to devour the world.  Silas, a roofer with calloused hands and eyes that held the wisdom of countless storms, felt a familiar tremor of unease.  This job, this particular roof, felt different.  The air itself seemed thick with a palpable something, a presence that chilled him to the bone despite the freezing rain.  He adjusted the heavy weight of the scaffolding ladder, his breath fogging in the frigid air.  His reputation, painstakingly built over decades, rested on his craftsmanship, his ability to navigate these treacherous landscapes, to mend the fragile skin of a city.  Today, though, it felt as though he stood on the edge of something far more profound than a simple repair job.
