Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the Willow Creek Rehabilitation Center, mimicking the relentless drumming in Amelia Blackwood's head.  The scent of antiseptic and stale coffee hung heavy in the air, a constant companion to the muted beeps and sighs emanating from the rooms beyond.  Amelia, a meticulous occupational therapist with a practiced calm, surveyed the chaos.  The meticulously arranged therapy room, usually a beacon of order and possibility, was a battlefield of scattered puzzles, misplaced utensils, and the ever-present, lingering frustration.  Today, it was amplified.  The center, a sprawling Victorian mansion converted decades ago, seemed to groan with the weight of unspoken anxieties and physical limitations.  A persistent drizzle soaked the overgrown rose bushes clawing at the weathered brick, mirroring the emotional storms brewing inside the patients. The worn wooden floorboards beneath her feet creaked with each step, a rhythmic counterpoint to the silent struggles playing out around her.  It was a Tuesday, another Tuesday, and the usual Tuesday routine was threatened by a new wave of crises: a patient with worsening tremors, a child with an incomplete recovery, and a staff member wrestling with their own anxieties.  It was a Tuesday unlike any other; and in the midst of this storm, Amelia had a feeling that this particular Tuesday might just define the next chapter of her life.
