Her uniform, once a symbol of urban efficiency, now seemed strangely out of place amid the vibrant yet desperate hues of the camp.  The rhythmic drone of distant helicopters, a constant soundtrack to the unfolding drama, offered little comfort. Tonight, the urgency wasn't about speeding through city streets, but about the slow, agonizing hours ahead.
