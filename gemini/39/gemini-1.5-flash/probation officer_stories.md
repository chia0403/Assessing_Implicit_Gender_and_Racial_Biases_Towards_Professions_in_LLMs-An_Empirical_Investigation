The biting November wind whipped Amelia Stone’s charcoal grey coat around her legs as she navigated the uneven cobblestones of Grimsborough’s Old Town.  Rain, a relentless drizzle that had been falling for days, slicked the already gloomy streets, reflecting the gaslight glow in shimmering puddles. The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and something else, something acrid and unsettling – the lingering perfume of decay that seemed permanently affixed to this forgotten corner of the city.  Amelia, a probation officer with the Grimsborough County Department of Corrections, pulled her collar higher, the damp chill seeping into her bones despite the layers of wool.  Tonight’s visit was to Silas Blackwood, a man whose release from prison had been fraught with controversy, even for a seasoned officer like herself. The old stone houses, their windows like vacant eyes staring out into the night, seemed to watch her progress with a silent, knowing disapproval.  The only sound louder than the wind was the rhythmic slap of her worn leather boots against the grimy pavement.
