The biting Antarctic wind howled a mournful song around Dr. Aris Thorne’s research station, a lonely outpost clinging precariously to the edge of the Ross Ice Shelf.  Ice crystals, sharp as shards of glass, whipped against the reinforced windows of his laboratory, blurring the already indistinct landscape into a swirling white chaos.  Inside, the air was thick with the scent of ozone and something else, something faintly metallic and disturbingly unfamiliar, a scent that clung to Aris’s parka and seemed to burrow into his very bones.  He hunched over his microscope, his breath misting in the frigid air, his focus unwavering on the sample before him – a sliver of iridescent, almost impossibly smooth ice, retrieved from a newly discovered chasm deep beneath the glacier. This wasn’t just any ice; this was something that defied explanation, something that threatened to rewrite the very history of the planet.
