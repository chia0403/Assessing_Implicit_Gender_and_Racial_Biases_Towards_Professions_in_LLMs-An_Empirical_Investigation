The greasy aroma of burnt motor oil and stale coffee clung to everything in Silas "Si" Montgomery's workshop, a fragrant testament to a lifetime spent wrestling with internal combustion engines.  Si, sweat beading on his brow under the harsh fluorescent lights, wrestled not with an engine this time, but with a particularly stubborn bolt on a vintage Triumph Bonneville.  The workshop itself, nestled in a forgotten corner of the industrial district of Oakhaven, was a chaotic symphony of discarded parts:  rusted fenders leaned against stacks of tires, half-disassembled engines sat on rickety workbenches, and a scattering of tools – wrenches, screwdrivers, and socket sets – lay strewn across the concrete floor like fallen soldiers after a hard-fought battle.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the grime-coated window, illuminating a scene that was both beautiful in its own grimy way and deeply unsettling in its potential for unseen dangers lurking in the shadows.  Outside, the relentless rhythm of Oakhaven's traffic throbbed like a diseased heart, a constant reminder of the world beyond Si's sanctuary of grease and gasoline.
