The midday sun beat down on Amelia Katherine Hayes's tiny, sun-drenched Brooklyn apartment, turning the already chaotic space into a kaleidoscope of shimmering dust motes and vibrant, half-finished design projects.  Scattered across her antique drafting table – a relic from her grandfather, a renowned architect – were crumpled sketches, overflowing paint palettes smeared with cerulean and burnt ochre, and three lukewarm mugs of what was probably yesterday's coffee.  Empty takeout containers from a nearby Vietnamese place hinted at a late-night fueled by deadlines and an unhealthy obsession with pho.  The air hung thick with the scent of turpentine and impending doom; Amelia, a graphic designer with a penchant for both breathtaking visuals and spectacular procrastination, was staring blankly at her computer screen, the cursor blinking mockingly at the untouched canvas of her latest project: the redesign of a major corporation's entire brand identity.  The deadline loomed, a monstrous, pixelated beast in the near future.
