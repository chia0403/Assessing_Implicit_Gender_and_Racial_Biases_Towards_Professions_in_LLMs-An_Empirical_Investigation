The scent of aged paper and leather hung heavy in the air, a comforting, familiar perfume to Eleanor Vance.  Dust motes, illuminated by the afternoon sun slanting through the high, arched windows of the Blackwood Memorial Library, danced in the quiet stillness.

Inside, Eleanor, hunched over a meticulously crafted card catalogue,  ignored the tempest raging beyond the thick stone walls.  The world outside could be chaotic, unpredictable; within these walls, amidst the ordered rows of books, resided a comforting sense of permanence, a haven from the storm.  Tonight, however, even the familiar solace of the Blackwood library felt… different. A subtle shift in the air, a prickling at the back of her neck, hinted at something unseen, something… unsettling.
