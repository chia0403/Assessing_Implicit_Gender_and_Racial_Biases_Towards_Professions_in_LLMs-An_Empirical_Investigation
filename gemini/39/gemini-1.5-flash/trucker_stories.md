The battered chrome of Big Rig Bertha’s grill reflected the bruised purple of the Wyoming sunset, casting long shadows across the desolate expanse of I-80.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of grit and gravel, danced on the horizon, mimicking the restless energy churning inside Ezekiel “Zeke” Stone’s gut.  He gripped the worn leather of the steering wheel, its familiar texture a small comfort in the vast, unforgiving landscape.  The air conditioner wheezed its last breath, a mournful counterpoint to the drone of the engine, and the only other sound was the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the tires chewing up the asphalt, a relentless pulse echoing the weariness in Zeke’s bones.  Ahead, the ribbon of highway stretched towards the distant, inky mountains, promising another night alone under a sky brimming with indifferent stars.  Tonight’s cargo was less than exciting – a load of dehydrated alfalfa pellets bound for a feedlot in Omaha – but the solitude, at least, was predictable.  And in Zeke’s life, predictability was a rare and precious commodity.
