The air hung thick and sweet with the scent of pine and damp earth, a smell Elias Thorne, a man built like an oak and weathered like its bark, knew as intimately as his own skin.  The dawn, a bruised purple bleeding into a hesitant gold, painted long shadows across the towering Douglas firs that clawed at the misty sky above the Cascade Mountains.  He stood on the edge of the logging road, his worn boots sinking slightly into the soft duff, the steel of his axe gleaming faintly in the pre-sunrise light.  Around him, the ancient forest stood silent, a cathedral of towering wood waiting to be felled, a symphony of rustling leaves and creaking branches yet to be silenced by the bite of his blade.  This was his domain, his church, and this morning's sermon would be a chorus of falling timber.
