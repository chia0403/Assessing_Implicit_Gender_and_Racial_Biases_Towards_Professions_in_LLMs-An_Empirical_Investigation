The wind, a rasping sculptor itself, whipped across the desolate moor, carrying with it the scent of brine and the mournful cry of gulls.  A low, grey sun, barely visible through the swirling mist, cast long, skeletal shadows from the jagged peaks of the Mourne Mountains.  Below, nestled in a valley carved by centuries of relentless erosion, lay the village of Carrickfergus.  And there, hunched over a half-finished headstone, his chisel chipping away at the stubborn granite, worked Elias Thorne.  Elias, with hands as rough and weathered as the stone he shaped, was the last of Carrickfergus' stone cutters, a dying breed in a world of pre-fabricated monuments.  The biting wind tugged at his thick woolen scarf, but he barely registered it; his focus remained entirely on the task before him, a task that held more significance than mere craftsmanship.  For the inscription he was carving, a simple name and dates, was the final epitaph for a life lost too soon, and a secret Elias carried heavier than any stone.
