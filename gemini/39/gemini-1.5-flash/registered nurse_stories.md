The sterile scent of antiseptic, usually a comfort to Eleanor Vance, RN, felt suffocating tonight.  Fluorescent lights hummed a discordant symphony above the chaotic flurry of activity in the emergency room of St. Jude's Hospital.  Rain lashed against the panoramic windows, blurring the city lights into shimmering streaks of white and gold, a stark contrast to the crimson stain blooming on the floor near triage, a stark reminder of the brutal efficiency of a broken femur.  Eleanor, her usually crisp white uniform now rumpled and stained with a mixture of blood and something she couldn’t quite place – perhaps the remnants of a spilled coffee, a small absurdity in the face of the overwhelming tragedy – felt the familiar knot of tension tighten in her stomach.  Another night, another onslaught of broken bodies and shattered lives.  Tonight, however, felt different.  Heavier.  Something in the air, beyond the usual miasma of fear and adrenaline, prickled at her senses, a premonition as sharp as the shards of glass glittering amongst the spilled liquid on the polished floor.
