The biting wind howled a mournful song across the desolate expanse of the Patagonian steppe, whipping Amelia "Amy" Hernandez's unruly brown curls across her face as she wrestled with the stubborn latch on the Cessna 182's cargo door.  The pre-dawn sky bled a bruised purple and orange, reflecting in the icy sheen of the dew-covered grass that stretched to the horizon, broken only by the occasional gnarled silhouette of a wind-bent tree.  The air hung thick with the smell of damp earth and something else, something faintly metallic and unsettling that prickled at the back of her neck.  This wasn't the picturesque postcard Patagonia she'd dreamed of; this was raw, untamed, and possibly, dangerously unpredictable.  Her mission: a clandestine cargo run to a remote research station nestled deep within the Andes.  But the premonition of trouble was heavier than the Cessna itself.
