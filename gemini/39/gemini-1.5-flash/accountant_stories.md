The fluorescent lights of the Blackwood & Finch accounting firm hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Katherine Hayes's meticulously organized world.  Amelia, or Amy as only a select few dared to call her, sat perched on her ergonomic chair, the faint scent of lemon polish clinging to the pristine surface of her mahogany desk.  Outside, the Chicago wind howled a mournful counterpoint to the office's sterile calm, rattling the rain-streaked windows of the 27th floor.  Tonight, however, the usual rhythmic tap-tap-tap of her fingers on the keyboard was replaced by a nervous stillness.  A mountain of paperwork, normally a comforting symbol of control, loomed before her, a stark white Everest against the deep mahogany.  But it wasn't the workload that unsettled Amy; it was the client.  Mr. Silas Blackwood himself, the enigmatic senior partner, had personally requested her presence in his office at 8 pm sharp, a time usually reserved for the quiet rustling of dust motes and the ghostly hum of the city after dark.
