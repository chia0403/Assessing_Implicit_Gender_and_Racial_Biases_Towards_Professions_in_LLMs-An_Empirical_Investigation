The biting November wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vance’s auburn hair across her face as she wrestled the heavy oak door of the Alder Creek Veterinary Clinic open.  The scent of pine needles, damp earth, and something faintly…musky, hit her like a physical blow.  Alder Creek, nestled deep in the Oregon Cascades, was a town where the wild things often wandered a little too close to civilization, and tonight was no exception. The clinic, a charming but slightly dilapidated Victorian building, creaked a sympathetic groan under the onslaught of the wind, its stained-glass windows depicting various woodland creatures now smeared with a film of rain and grime. Inside, the only illumination came from a single flickering lamp casting long, dancing shadows on the worn wooden floors.  The air hung heavy with the familiar, comforting aroma of antiseptic and something distinctly…untamed.
