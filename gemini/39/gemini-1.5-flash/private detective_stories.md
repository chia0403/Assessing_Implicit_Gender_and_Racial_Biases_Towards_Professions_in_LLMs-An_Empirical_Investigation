The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Isabella “Izzy” Diaz’s office, a rhythm that mirrored the relentless pounding in her head.  The air hung thick with the smell of stale coffee and desperation, a scent as familiar to her as her own reflection in the cracked windowpane.  Her office, a cramped space above a failing laundromat in the perpetually rain-soaked alleyways of Seattle's Pike Place Market, was a testament to her less-than-glamorous career as a private investigator.  Empty takeout containers littered the scarred desk, alongside a stack of crumpled case files threatening to topple at any moment.  Outside, the cacophony of the market – the hawkers' cries, the seagulls' squawks, the rumble of delivery trucks – faded into a muted roar, swallowed by the downpour.  Izzy, nursing a lukewarm cup of something vaguely resembling coffee, stared out at the deluge, her gaze fixed on a particularly tenacious raindrop clinging precariously to the grimy glass.  Another case, another headache.  This one, however, felt different.  Heavier.  More personal.
