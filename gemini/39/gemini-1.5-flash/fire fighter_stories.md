The acrid bite of woodsmoke stung Lieutenant Evelyn Grace "Evie" Blackwood's nostrils, a familiar companion on nights like these.  The late September air, usually crisp and carrying the scent of falling leaves, hung thick and heavy with the stench of burning pine and something else… something sickeningly sweet.  She squinted through the swirling haze, the flickering orange glow of the inferno painting grotesque shadows on the gnarled trunks of the redwood forest surrounding Redwood Creek.  The flames, fueled by a relentless wind whipping through the canyon, danced like malevolent spirits, consuming everything in their path –  a scene both terrifying and heartbreakingly beautiful.  This wasn't just another brush fire; this was a full-blown conflagration, threatening not just the ancient trees but the homes clinging precariously to the hillside beyond.  The crackle of the fire was a symphony of destruction, punctuated by the rhythmic roar of her fellow firefighters' engines and the urgent crackle of their radios.  Evie felt the familiar adrenaline surge, a potent cocktail of fear and exhilaration, as she adjusted her helmet and tightened her grip on her axe. Tonight, Redwood Creek was under siege.
