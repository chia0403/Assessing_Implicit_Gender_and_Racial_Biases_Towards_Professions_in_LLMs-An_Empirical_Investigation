The salt spray stung Officer Elara Vance's face as the November wind howled a mournful dirge across the desolate expanse of Saltwind Bay.  The sky, a bruised purple bleeding into a sickly grey, mirrored the grimness clinging to the craggy cliffs that guarded the tiny, windswept fishing village of Port Blossom.  The air, thick with the smell of brine and decaying seaweed, carried the faint, unsettling tang of something else â€“ something metallic and acrid, a scent Elara knew all too well. It was the smell of death, clinging to the edges of the storm, as persistent and chilling as the icy wind itself.  This wasn't the picturesque postcard view tourists flocked to during the summer months; this was Port Blossom baring its teeth, a place where secrets were buried as deep as the ocean floor.
