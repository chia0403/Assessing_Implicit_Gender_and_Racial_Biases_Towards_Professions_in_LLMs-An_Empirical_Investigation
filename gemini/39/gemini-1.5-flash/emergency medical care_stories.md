The biting November wind whipped Amelia Hernandez’s hair across her face as she wrestled the back doors of the ambulance open.  The stench of woodsmoke and something acrid, metallic, hung heavy in the air, clinging to the damp chill that permeated the small, isolated village of Oakhaven.  Amelia, a paramedic with five years of experience under her belt but still only twenty-seven years old, pulled her thermal jacket tighter, the bright orange reflecting faintly in the flickering orange glow emanating from the distant farmhouse.  Oakhaven, nestled deep within the sprawling, ancient Redwood National Park, was a place where even the emergency calls felt steeped in a primeval darkness, a stark contrast to the sterile, brightly-lit hallways of the city hospital where she’d trained. Tonight, however, the darkness felt particularly ominous.  The crackling radio still buzzed with the initial dispatch: single-vehicle accident, unknown injuries, immediate response required.  The silence following the dispatch, broken only by the wind whispering through the towering redwoods, was far more unsettling than any alarm.
