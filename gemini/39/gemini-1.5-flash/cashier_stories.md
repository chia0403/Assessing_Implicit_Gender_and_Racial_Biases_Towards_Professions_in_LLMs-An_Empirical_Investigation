The fluorescent lights of "Quick Stop & Shop" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Grace Hawthorne's Tuesday afternoon.  The air, thick with the cloying sweetness of stale donuts and the faint, metallic tang of spilled soda, hung heavy and still.  Amelia, her nametag slightly askew, leaned against the chipped Formica counter, the rhythmic *beep-beep-beep* of the scanner her only companion besides the relentless drone of the highway outside.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the already indistinct landscape into a grey, watery smear.  Inside, the Quick Stop was a desolate island of linoleum and plastic, awaiting the next weary traveler or caffeine-craving commuter to break the monotony.  Tonight, however, the silence felt heavier than usual, a pregnant pause before the storm that Amelia knew was brewing â€“ both outside and within the confines of her own increasingly frustrated heart.
