The relentless Georgia sun beat down on the corrugated iron roof of Amelia Jean Prescott's pharmacy, baking the air thick and heavy with the scent of honeysuckle and simmering asphalt.  Cicadas buzzed a relentless counterpoint to the rhythmic *click-clack* of Amelia's mortar and pestle as she meticulously ground dried chamomile blossoms.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight slicing through the gloom of Prescott's Pharmacy, a relic of a bygone era nestled on the edge of Harmony Creek, a town so small it barely registered on most maps.  The wooden shelves, packed with jars filled with herbs and tinctures, creaked a mournful song under the weight of years and countless remedies, a testament to Amelia's family's long history serving the town's eclectic residents.  The bell above the door jingled, announcing a visitor, a welcome interruption to the soothing rhythm of her work.
