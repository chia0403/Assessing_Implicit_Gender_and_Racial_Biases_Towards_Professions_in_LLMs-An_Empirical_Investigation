The brass nameplate gleamed under the subdued lighting of the opulent lobby:  *Aurelian “Rey” Blackwood, Concierge*.  Rey adjusted his impeccably knotted tie, the silk whispering against his crisp white shirt, a sound as quiet as the hushed reverence that permeated the Grand Phoenician Hotel.  Rain lashed against the vast arched windows overlooking the glittering cityscape of San Francisco, the rhythmic drumming a counterpoint to the soft jazz drifting from the hidden speakers.  Inside, the air was thick with the scent of expensive perfume and freshly cut lilies, a carefully curated olfactory experience designed to soothe the anxieties of the hotel’s ultra-wealthy guests.  Tonight, however, a different kind of tension hung in the air, a prickling unease Rey couldn't quite place, something far more unsettling than a delayed limousine or a misplaced diamond necklace.  He knew, with the instinctive certainty that came from years of anticipating the needs – and unspoken anxieties – of the world’s elite, that this night was going to be anything but ordinary.
