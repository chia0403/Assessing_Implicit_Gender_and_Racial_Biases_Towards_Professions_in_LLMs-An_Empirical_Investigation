The pre-dawn chill bit at Elias Thorne’s cheeks as he hauled a sack of flour onto the worn wooden planks of his bakery's loading dock.  Dust motes, illuminated by the weak glow of the single gas lamp hanging above, danced in the frigid air like tiny, frantic moths.  Elias, his breath misting before him, adjusted the thick wool scarf around his neck, the scent of woodsmoke and baking bread clinging to it like a second skin.  The bakery, “Thorne's Treats,” nestled on the cobbled edge of Oakhaven, a town clinging stubbornly to the side of a steep, snow-dusted mountain, was already stirring to life.  The rhythmic thump of the baker's own heartbeat matched the steady, almost hypnotic, rhythm of the approaching morning train, its whistle a mournful cry echoing across the valley.  Today, however, the usual peaceful anticipation was tinged with a nervous energy, a tremor of something unknown that Elias couldn't quite place, a feeling as unsettling as the lingering frost on the windowpanes of his beloved bakery.
