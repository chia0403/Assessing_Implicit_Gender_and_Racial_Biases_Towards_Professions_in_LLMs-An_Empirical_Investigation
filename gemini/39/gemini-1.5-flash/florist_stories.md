The scent of lilies, heavy and sweet, hung thick in the air, a fragrant counterpoint to the biting November wind rattling the stained-glass windows of "Petals & Promises."  Inside, amongst overflowing vases and the muted rustle of silk ribbons, Aurelia "Reli" Hawthorne meticulously arranged a cascade of deep burgundy roses, her nimble fingers moving with a practiced grace that belied the tremor in her hand.  Reli wasn't just arranging flowers; she was crafting stories, each bouquet a silent narrative whispered in petals and foliage.  Outside, the cobblestones of Oakhaven, a town steeped in history and shrouded in a perpetual autumnal haze, were slick with rain.  The gas lamps, casting a hazy glow on the shopfront, reflected in the rain-streaked windows, blurring the already slightly blurry image of Reli, lost in her floral world, oblivious to the storm brewing both outside and within her own heart.
