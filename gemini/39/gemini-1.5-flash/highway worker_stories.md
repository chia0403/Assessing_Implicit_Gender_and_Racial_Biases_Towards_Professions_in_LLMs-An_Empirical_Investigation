The rasping cough of the grader echoed across the desolate expanse of Highway 17, a sound swallowed almost instantly by the vast, ochre sky of the Arizona desert.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of grit and sun-baked earth, danced across the cracked asphalt like mischievous spirits.  Forty-five degrees in the shade – if you could find any –  and already the sun beat down with the relentless fury of a vengeful god.  Amelia “Amy” Hernandez, her face shielded by a sweat-soaked bandana, gripped the steering wheel of the rumbling machine, her knuckles white against the worn leather. The endless ribbon of highway stretched before her, shimmering in the heat haze, a testament to both human ingenuity and the unforgiving nature of the landscape.  She squinted, the glare reflecting off the chrome of the grader's blade, a familiar ache settling in her lower back. Another day, another stretch of unforgiving desert road.
