The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne's hair across her face, stinging her cheeks a rosy red that clashed spectacularly with the muted greys of the Scottish Highlands.  Rain, a fine, persistent drizzle that clung to everything like a second skin, plastered her dark curls to her forehead.  Amelia, more used to the bright, sun-drenched streets of her London studio, shivered, pulling her worn tweed coat tighter around her.  The vast, brooding landscape of Glencoe unfolded before her, a breathtaking panorama of jagged peaks cloaked in mist, their dark silhouettes etched against a bruised, pewter sky.  She clutched her vintage Leica M6, its cold metal a comforting weight in her gloved hands. This was it. The location for the photoshoot that would, if all went well, finally launch her career beyond the confines of wedding albums and corporate headshots.  This was where she would capture the raw, untamed beauty of Scotland, a beauty that mirrored the turbulent emotions swirling within her own heart.
