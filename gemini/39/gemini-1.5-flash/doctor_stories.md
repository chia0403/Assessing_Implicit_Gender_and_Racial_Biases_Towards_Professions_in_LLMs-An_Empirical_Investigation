The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful song around Dr. Eleanor Vance as she wrestled the heavy sled across the frozen tundra.  The air, sharp as shattered glass, stung her exposed cheeks, and the rhythmic crunch of snow under the runners was the only sound louder than the relentless wind.  Ahead, a single, wavering beam of light pulsed from a distant cabin, its fragile promise of warmth a beacon in the swirling white chaos.  Eleanor, bundled in layers of furs that did little to stem the icy bite, tightened her grip on the sled's ropes.  Inside, nestled amongst the furs and medical supplies, lay her patient â€“ a young Inupiaq hunter named Silas, his life hanging by a thread after a brutal encounter with a polar bear.  The nearest hospital was a three-day dogsled journey away, and the storm, already raging, threatened to make even that impossible.  This remote outpost, barely more than a cluster of weather-beaten cabins clinging to the edge of the Arctic wilderness, was now Eleanor's battleground against the elements, and against death itself.
