The stale scent of sawdust and forgotten dreams hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Alistair Finchley-Partridge.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single bare bulb swinging precariously above, danced in the cavernous space of the Blackwood Theatre's workshop.  Years of theatrical detritus – crumpled scripts, discarded costumes smelling faintly of mothballs, and props ranging from a tarnished silver chalice to a surprisingly intact stuffed badger – lay scattered amongst the workbenches, a testament to countless productions past and, Alistair suspected, a few more to come, though their funding remained, as always, perilously precarious.  The Blackwood, a venerable but undeniably decrepit building clinging precariously to the edge of the city's decaying theatre district, felt more like a mausoleum than a place of vibrant creativity tonight. But Alistair, with his perpetually rumpled tweed jacket and eyes that held the weary wisdom of a thousand opening nights, felt perfectly at home.  He ran a hand through his already chaotic hair, a sigh escaping his lips as he surveyed the scene – the scene, he mused, before the scene. Tonight, the real drama was yet to begin.
