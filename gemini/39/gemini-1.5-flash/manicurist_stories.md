The scent of acetone and lavender hung thick and sweet in the air, a perfume as familiar to Seraphina "Sera" Bellweather as her own heartbeat.  Rain lashed against the oversized window of "Sera's Nails," blurring the neon glow of the liquor store across the street into a hazy, shimmering rectangle.  Inside, the salon was a haven of surprisingly cheerful chaos.  Pink and purple fairy lights twinkled amongst the meticulously organized bottles of polish, a stark contrast to the grey, wind-whipped misery outside.  Sera, perched on her stool, her nimble fingers working magic on a client's chipped French manicure, listened to the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of her nail file as a low hum of conversation drifted from the other two stations.  It was a Tuesday night in the gritty heart of Port Blossom, Oregon, and business, as usual, was anything but quiet.
