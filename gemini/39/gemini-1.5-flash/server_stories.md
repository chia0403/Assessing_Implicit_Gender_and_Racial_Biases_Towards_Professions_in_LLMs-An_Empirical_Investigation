The chipped Formica tabletop felt slick under Amelia Hernandez's hand as she wiped it down for the tenth time that morning.  Grease clung stubbornly to the surface, a testament to last night's disastrous fish fry special and the subsequent, chaotic rush.  Amelia sighed, the scent of stale coffee and frying onions doing little to lift her spirits.  The fluorescent lights of "The Rusty Mug" diner hummed a monotonous tune, reflecting harshly off the chrome trim of the worn booths and the perpetually greasy stainless steel counter.  Rain lashed against the dusty windows, blurring the already indistinct view of the deserted highway stretching out beyond.  It was 6:00 AM, and the only other soul in the diner besides Amelia was a grumpy cook named Earl, who was currently engaged in a loud argument with a malfunctioning coffee machine.  This, Amelia thought grimly, was going to be a long day.
