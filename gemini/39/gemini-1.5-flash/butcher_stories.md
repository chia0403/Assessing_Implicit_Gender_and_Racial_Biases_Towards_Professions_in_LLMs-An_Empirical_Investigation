The chill wind, sharp as a cleaver, sliced through Archibald “Archie” Bartholomew’s thick wool coat, carrying with it the scent of brine and coal smoke from the nearby docks.  He pulled his collar higher, the rough fabric scratching against his already chapped cheeks.  The cobblestones of Grimsborough’s Butcher’s Row were slick with a mixture of melted snow and something darker, something he couldn't quite place – a stain upon the already grim scene.  Archie paused, his breath misting in the frigid air, his gaze sweeping over his shop, Bartholomew's Best, its sign creaking faintly in the wind.  The window, fogged with condensation, revealed a tempting display of sausages, plump and juicy, a stark contrast to the unsettling darkness that clung to the alleyway behind him.  This was no ordinary Grimsborough morning; something felt…off.
