The chipped porcelain sink wept a thin stream of lukewarm water onto the stained linoleum floor, mirroring the slow drip, drip, drip of Elara Genevieve Nightingale’s dwindling hope.  Elara, a name whispered once in hushed reverence in the smoky backrooms of jazz clubs, now echoed only in the near-empty, echoing expanse of her cramped apartment above a failing bakery in the forgotten corner of Montmartre.  The scent of stale croissants and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a bittersweet aroma that perfectly encapsulated her current state.  Rain lashed against the single, grimy windowpane, blurring the already indistinct view of the Parisian street below, where the only sounds were the rhythmic slap of tires on wet cobblestones and the mournful sigh of the wind whistling through the broken shutters.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single bare bulb hanging precariously from the ceiling, danced in the gloom like tiny, forlorn spirits.  This was her life now – a far cry from the glittering stages and roaring applause that had once been her reality.
