The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Katherine Finch’s hands, the lukewarm tea doing little to dispel the chill that had settled deep in her bones, a chill far colder than the November air whistling through the gaps in the window frames of her office.  Amelia, a woman whose life was meticulously organized – every pencil sharpened to a precise point, every invoice filed chronologically, every bank statement balanced to the penny – found herself inexplicably thrown.  Her office, a cramped space above a bakery on the cobbled lane of Miller Street in the perpetually overcast town of Oakhaven, usually hummed with the comforting rhythm of her work.  Today, however, the only sound was the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner, a relentless counterpoint to the unsettling silence that had descended since the arrival of the letter.  The letter, with its thick, cream-colored paper and ominous black wax seal, sat unopened on her blotter, a stark contrast to the neatly stacked ledgers and the precise rows of her meticulously organized accounting supplies.  The scent of freshly baked bread, usually a comforting aroma, did little to soothe her growing unease.  Something was profoundly wrong, and Amelia Katherine Finch, bookkeeper extraordinaire, was about to find out just how wrong.
