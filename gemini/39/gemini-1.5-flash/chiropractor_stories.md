The salt spray stung Dr. Eleanor Vance’s face as she wrestled the stubborn awning of her beachfront clinic into submission.  The wind, a relentless Pacific beast, howled a mournful tune around the weathered grey clapboard building, threatening to rip the whole ramshackle structure from its precarious perch on the cliffs overlooking the churning ocean.  Seagulls, fat and impertinent, wheeled overhead, their cries a jarring counterpoint to the rhythmic crash of waves against the rocks below.  Inside, the air was thick with the scent of ozone, seaweed, and the faintly medicinal aroma of arnica oil – a constant reminder of the demanding lives her patients led in this remote coastal town of Port Blossom, Oregon.  The clinic itself, a converted fisherman’s cottage, was charming in a slightly dilapidated way, its windows misted with sea spray and its paint peeling in places, revealing layers of faded turquoise and sun-bleached white beneath.  But Eleanor wouldn't have it any other way.  The ocean, the rugged beauty, and the unique challenges of her patients were as much a part of her practice as the spinal adjustments themselves.
