The sterile scent of ozone hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Amelia Grace Hawthorne, a scent that usually soothed her. But today, the antiseptic aroma only served to heighten the tremor in her hands as she meticulously laid out her instruments.  Amelia, a dental hygienist with five years of experience at Serenity Dental, usually approached her work with a practiced calm, her movements precise and efficient.  This morning, however, a different kind of tension gripped her, a knot of anxiety tightening in her chest with every click of the sterilizer.  The sun, barely cresting the horizon, cast long shadows across the polished chrome of the dental chairs in the otherwise brightly lit office of Serenity Dental, located in the quaint, coastal town of Seabrook, Maine.  The rhythmic crash of waves against the nearby cliffs was a constant backdrop to the usually tranquil hum of the practice, a sound that today felt jarringly loud, mirroring the erratic beat of her heart.
