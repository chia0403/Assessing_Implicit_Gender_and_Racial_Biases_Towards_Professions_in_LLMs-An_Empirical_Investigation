This was the domain of Aurelia Josephine Moreau, a woman whose life, like her salon, was a chaotic blend of vibrant colour and subtle decay.  Aurelia, with her fingers stained a kaleidoscope of dyes and her hair a riot of carefully sculpted auburn curls, sighed, the sound barely audible above the hum of the ancient hair dryer. Today, however, the usual comforting rhythm of her work was shattered by the storm brewing outside, and the ominous shadow of a client whose appointment threatened to unravel more than just a bad perm.
