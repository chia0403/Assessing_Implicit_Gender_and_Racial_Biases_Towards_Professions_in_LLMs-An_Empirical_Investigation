The chipped paint of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's office desk mirrored the state of his soul â€“ a faded, slightly melancholic beige.  Barty, a man whose ambition had long since curdled into a resigned acceptance of mediocrity, stared out the rain-streaked window of his small, insurance brokerage office on the third floor of a crumbling building overlooking the perpetually grey harbor of Grimsborough.  The rhythmic slap of rain against the glass was a monotonous soundtrack to the equally monotonous drone of his computer fan, a counterpoint to the even more monotonous paperwork spread across his desk. Grimsborough, a town perpetually caught in a downpour both literal and metaphorical, offered little in the way of excitement, and Barty Butterfield, agent for "Grimsborough Assurance: Securing Your Tomorrow (Eventually)," was firmly entrenched in its soggy embrace.  The only splash of color in his dreary existence was the vibrant crimson of the "Grimsborough Assurance" logo, ironically mocking his lackluster career.
