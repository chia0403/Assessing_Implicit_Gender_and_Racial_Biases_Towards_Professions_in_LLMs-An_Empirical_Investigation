The air hung thick and sweet, a cloying blend of pomade, bay rum, and the lingering scent of burnt coffee from the diner across the street.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grimy window of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's Barber Shop, illuminating the swirling chaos of his workspace.  Barty himself, a man whose age was as indeterminate as the shades of brown in his meticulously-maintained moustache, was hunched over a customer, his shears snipping with the practiced ease of a seasoned surgeon.  The shop itself was a testament to decades of accumulated history â€“ chipped porcelain mugs lined the shelves alongside faded photographs of grinning clientele and sporting trophies dating back to a bygone era.  The worn leather chair groaned softly beneath the weight of the current customer, a grizzled old fisherman with a face like a weathered map.  Outside, the relentless rhythm of the sea crashing against the rocky Maine coast provided a constant, soothing backdrop to the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of Barty's shears.
