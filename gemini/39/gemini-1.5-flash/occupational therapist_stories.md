The biting November wind whipped Amelia Katherine Hayes’s auburn hair across her face as she hurried down the cobblestone street, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clinging to the air.  Grey skies wept a relentless drizzle over the quaint, if slightly dilapidated, village of Oakhaven, nestled deep within the rolling hills of the Cotswolds.  Amelia, an occupational therapist with a penchant for sensible tweed and a surprisingly resilient spirit, pulled her scarf tighter around her neck.  She wasn’t usually late, but a rogue badger had decided to stage a dramatic stand-off with her car, delaying her journey to Oakhaven Manor, her latest – and arguably most challenging – assignment.  The manor, a gothic monstrosity perched precariously on the hillside, loomed ahead, its darkened windows like vacant eyes staring down at the storm-lashed village below.  This was no ordinary case; this was Blackwood Manor, and Amelia knew, with a shiver that had nothing to do with the cold, that this would be far more than just another day at the office.
