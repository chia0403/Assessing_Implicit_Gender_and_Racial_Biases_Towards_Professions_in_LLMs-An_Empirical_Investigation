The humid air hung thick and heavy, a shimmering veil over the mirrored walls of "Body & Soul Fitness."  Sweat beaded on the forehead of Amelia Hernandez, instructor extraordinaire, as she adjusted the microphone clipped to her lycra top.  The rhythmic thump of Latin beats pulsed from the studio's sound system, a relentless heartbeat mirroring the anticipation thrumming in her own chest.  Tonight wasn't just another Zumba class; tonight was the culmination of months of planning, a chance to showcase her innovative choreography inspired by her recent trip to Cuba.  The scent of sandalwood incense, a carefully chosen detail meant to enhance the experience, mingled with the smell of exertion and slightly stale gym socks, a peculiar but familiar perfume of Amelia's professional life.  The lights dimmed, casting long shadows that danced across the expectant faces of her thirty participants.  Tonight, Amelia would take them on a journey, a vibrant, sweaty, soul-stirring journey to the heart of Cuba.
