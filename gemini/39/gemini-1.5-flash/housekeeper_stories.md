The chipped porcelain teacup rattled in Elara Blackwood's hand, mirroring the tremor in her own body.  Dust motes, illuminated by the weak November sun slanting through the grimy windowpanes of Blackwood Manor, danced in the stagnant air.  The manor itself hunched, a gothic behemoth of grey stone and decaying grandeur, perched precariously on a windswept cliff overlooking the churning grey sea.  Sea spray, laced with the pungent tang of brine and something else – something indefinably *off* – constantly peppered the weathered façade. Elara, a woman whose life was measured in the rhythmic sweep of a feather duster and the careful polishing of silver, felt a prickle of unease crawl up her spine.  It wasn't the usual chill of the approaching winter; this was deeper, a cold that seeped from the very stones beneath her worn leather boots. This was Blackwood Manor's latest, and perhaps most unsettling, mood.
