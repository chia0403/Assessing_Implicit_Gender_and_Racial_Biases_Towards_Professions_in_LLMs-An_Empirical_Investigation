The relentless Florida sun beat down on Amelia Hernandez’s shoulders, turning the already shimmering asphalt of I-95 into a heat-haze mirage.  Amelia, a name that felt as sun-drenched and languid as the landscape itself, squinted at the GPS clinging to her dashboard.

The air hung thick and heavy, carrying the scent of saltwater and decaying vegetation, a stark contrast to the pristine manicured lawns and perfectly-placed hibiscus she was accustomed to selling.  This wasn't a high-end real estate deal; this was a fixer-upper, a swamp-adjacent fixer-upper, and Amelia, the queen of waterfront villas, was about to find out just how far her sales prowess could reach.
