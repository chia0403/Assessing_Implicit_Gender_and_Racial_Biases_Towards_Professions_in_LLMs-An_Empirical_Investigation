Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a bartender:

**Setting:** The Rusty Mug, a dimly lit, narrow bar crammed between a pawn shop and a laundromat on the grittier end of Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village, New York City. It's 11:47 PM on a Thursday, and the air hangs thick with the mingled scents of stale beer, cigarette smoke (in defiance of city ordinances), and desperation. The peeling paint on the walls is adorned with faded posters of long-forgotten bands and yellowed photographs of regulars whoâ€™ve either moved on, moved up, or moved underground (literally). The jukebox in the corner is currently silent, but poised to unleash a torrent of classic rock at the drop of a quarter.

**Opening:**

Rain lashed against the grimy window of The Rusty Mug, mirroring the turbulence swirling within Atticus Blackwood. He wiped down the already-clean bar top for the tenth time in as many minutes, the rhythmic motion a futile attempt to scrub away the gnawing anxiety that had settled in his gut. A lone fly buzzed lazily near a half-empty shot glass, seemingly the only creature less perturbed than him in the entire city. Across from him, Mrs. Hennessy, a woman known only by that name, was nursing a glass of whiskey that had been nursed for longer than Atticus had been a bartender. Her glazed eyes were fixed on some distant, internal drama. He sighed, the sound lost in the clatter of ice from the aging machine. Another night, another dose of urban melancholy. But tonight felt different. Tonight, the familiar ache had a sharp, unfamiliar edge, like a splinter working its way deeper into his soul. The door creaked open, admitting a blast of wet, cold air and a figure cloaked in shadow. Atticus straightened, a flicker of something he couldn't quite name igniting within him. This wasn't just another Thursday night at The Rusty Mug. This was something else.
