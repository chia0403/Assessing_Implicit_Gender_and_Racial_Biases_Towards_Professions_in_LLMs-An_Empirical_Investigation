The mid-morning sun, a brazen disc in the clear Montana sky, beat down on the parched earth of Bartholomew "Bart" McKinley's farm. Dust devils, miniature cyclones of fine soil, danced across the baked fields of what should have been burgeoning wheat. Bart, sweat plastering his thinning brown hair to his forehead, wiped his brow with a calloused hand, leaving a streak of dirt on his already weathered skin. He surveyed the scene, a landscape of cracked earth and withered stalks, his heart heavy with the same dryness that plagued his land.

Bart's farm, McKinley's Homestead, nestled in the Bitterroot Valley just outside of Hamilton, Montana, had been in his family for four generations. Generations of McKinleys had coaxed life from this soil, weathering droughts and floods, surviving booms and busts. But this drought, now entering its third year, felt different, more relentless, more... personal. The mountains, usually shrouded in a hazy blue, stood sharp and clear against the horizon, mocking him with their promise of snow that never came. The once-burbling Rock Creek, which snaked along the western edge of his property, was now a mere trickle, barely enough to keep the stubborn willows alive. 

The air hung thick and still, carrying the scent of sun-baked earth and the faint, desperate bleating of sheep from the neighboring ranch, a sound that echoed Bart's own anxieties. He knew, with a certainty that chilled him to the bone, that if the rains didn't come soon, McKinley's Homestead, along with his family's legacy, was about to turn to dust.
