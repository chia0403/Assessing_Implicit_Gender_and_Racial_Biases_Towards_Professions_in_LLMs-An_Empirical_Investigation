The clatter of keyboard keys was the soundtrack to Elara Beatrice Thorneâ€™s existence. A rhythmic, maddening symphony played out in the beige-walled cubicle farm of Bloom & Barnaby, a mid-sized accounting firm nestled in the heart of downtown Philadelphia. Elara, whose aspirations had once stretched further than perfecting the font size on quarterly reports, sat hunched over her desk, the fluorescent lights reflecting dully in her perpetually tired eyes.

Outside, the city thrummed with the life she felt increasingly divorced from. Cars honked, sirens wailed, and snippets of conversations, carried on the wind, drifted through the slightly ajar window near her desk. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of stale coffee and the quiet desperation of spreadsheets.

Elara was Secretary to Mr. Archibald Barnaby himself, a man whose personality was as muted and unremarkable as his beige tie collection. Her days were filled with answering phones, scheduling meetings that never seemed to end, and brewing enough coffee to keep the entire firm wired for the fiscal year. She was a master of multi-tasking, a champion of calendar management, and a silent, efficient cog in the Bloom & Barnaby machine. But sometimes, late in the afternoon when the light slanted just so and cast long shadows across the cubicles, she'd catch her reflection in her computer screen and wonder if this was all there was. This beige existence, punctuated by the clatter of keys and the hushed directives of Mr. Barnaby.
