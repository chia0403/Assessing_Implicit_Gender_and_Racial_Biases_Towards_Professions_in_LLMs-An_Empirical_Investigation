The garish floral wallpaper screamed louder than a distressed seller in a bidding war. Eleanor Beatrice Ainsworth, star real estate agent at Century Sunrise Realty, sighed, adjusting the oversized, gold-rimmed glasses perched precariously on her nose. This was it. The final, and arguably most challenging, listing of her burgeoning career: the Widow McGregor's rambling, Victorian mansion at 13 Oakhaven Lane, Blackwood Creek.

Blackwood Creek itself was a postcard town steeped in an eerie tranquility that Eleanor found unnerving. Nestled deep within the Appalachian foothills, it was a place where secrets lingered in the damp, mossy stone of ancient houses and whispers rode the wind through the gnarled branches of the omnipresent oak trees. The houses were charming, if a little…dated. Charmingly dated, that’s what she’d told herself. Charmingly…haunted was what she truly suspected.

Eleanor, a woman more accustomed to the sleek, minimalist lines of modern architecture than the gabled roofs and gingerbread trim that defined Blackwood Creek, felt like an alien anthropologist dropped into a meticulously preserved Victorian diorama. Even the air felt different here, thick with the scent of damp earth, woodsmoke, and something else…something ancient and unsettling that prickled the back of her neck. 

She pushed open the creaking front door of 13 Oakhaven Lane, the scent of lavender and dust assaulting her nostrils. "Hello?" she called out, her voice echoing in the cavernous foyer, lined with portraits of stern-faced men with mutton chops and beady eyes. The house felt colder than the November air outside. This was going to be a long, and possibly terrifying, listing. Eleanor just hoped she could sell it before it, or its long-dead residents, sold *her* soul.
