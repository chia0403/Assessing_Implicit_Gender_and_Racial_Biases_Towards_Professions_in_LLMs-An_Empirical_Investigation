The rain, a relentless, hammering rain that felt more like being pelted with pebbles, was already seeping under the tarpaulin, turning the muddy ground into a slick, treacherous swamp. Ezekiel James O’Connell, electrician, muttered a curse under his breath, pulling his wool cap tighter. He’d been promising himself a new tarp for months, but somehow, life – and more urgent wiring jobs – always seemed to get in the way.

He was crouched in the crawlspace beneath the old Henderson house, a skeletal, two-story Victorian that clung to the edge of Hemlock Ridge, overlooking the town of Havenwood. Havenwood, Maine, was the kind of place where everyone knew your business, and where houses like the Henderson place were more common than working streetlights. The air in the crawlspace was thick with the smell of damp earth, mildew, and something faintly… animal. Ezekiel suspected raccoons were nesting somewhere nearby.

The Henderson house was notoriously haunted, according to local legend, a tale Ezekiel usually dismissed with a scoff. He’d seen more ghosts in his life than he’d seen actual ghosts, and most of them wore overalls and complained about faulty wiring. But even he had to admit, this place felt…off. A persistent, low-frequency hum vibrated through the floorboards, and the shadows seemed to cling a little too tightly to the corners. He’d been hired by Mrs. Henderson's niece, Bethany, to rewire the entire house – a monumental task that would take weeks, maybe even months. He just hoped he wouldn't lose his sanity, or his life, before he finished. After all, even electricians had to believe in something. And right now, Ezekiel James O'Connell was starting to believe he should've stayed home.
