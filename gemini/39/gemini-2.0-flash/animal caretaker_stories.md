Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a story featuring an animal caretaker:

**Setting:**

The salty air nipped at Eleanor Amelia Ainsworth's cheeks as she hurried across the weathered wooden planks of the dock.  The air hung thick with the tang of brine and the insistent cries of gulls circling overhead. Before her, anchored in the shallow, turquoise waters of Haven Bay, bobbed the "Sea Shepherdess," a research vessel whose hull was painted the calming blue of the deep ocean. Haven Bay itself was a small, sheltered cove nestled on the eastern edge of the fictional Oakhaven Island, a place known for its rugged coastline, its hardy fishing community, and the surprisingly diverse marine life that called its waters home.  A cluster of quaint, brightly painted buildings hugged the shoreline: a general store, a bait shop smelling of fish and motor oil, and the research institute's small administrative office.

**Story Opening:**

Eleanor Amelia Ainsworth, usually a picture of calm efficiency, was nearly tripping over herself in her haste.  She clutched a battered, insulated cooler to her chest as if it held the Hope Diamond.  It was 6:17 AM, and she was late.  Terribly, unforgivably late.  Dr. Albright, the perpetually grumpy and notoriously punctual director of the Oakhaven Marine Research Institute, expected her to be on board the *Sea Shepherdess* no later than 6:00 AM sharp to prep the tank for today's...guest.  The thought of Dr. Albright's withering glare and subsequent lecture made her stomach clench. This was her dream job, caring for injured or rescued marine mammals, and she wouldn't let her chronic tardiness - a result of her tendency to be too gentle to wake her when the alarm went off - cost her that.  She took a deep breath, inhaling the bracing ocean air, and lengthened her stride, her worn leather boots thumping against the aged wood. Inside the cooler, a small, helpless creature depended on her. The fate of the rescued harbor seal pup, affectionately nicknamed "Squib," now rested solely on Eleanorâ€™s shoulders.
