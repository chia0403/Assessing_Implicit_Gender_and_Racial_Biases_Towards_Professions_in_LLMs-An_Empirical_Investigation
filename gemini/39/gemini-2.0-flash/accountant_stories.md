## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights of Ledger & Lynch hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack familiar to Beatrice Eleanor Abernathy after nearly ten years of service. Outside, the November rain lashed against the grimy windows of the 17th floor, blurring the city skyline into an impressionistic painting of grey and steel. But Beatrice, perched at her meticulously organized desk amidst stacks of invoices and tax forms, barely noticed. Her world was a carefully constructed universe of spreadsheets and deductions, a realm where balance was not just an ideal, but a requirement.

Tonight, however, the universe was tilting.

Her fingers hovered over the "Enter" key, the cursor blinking mockingly on the screen. The final quarterly report for OmniCorp, their biggest client, stared back at her with a disquieting simplicity. Numbers, impeccably aligned, meticulously calculated, all pointing to a profit margin that defied logic. It was too good to be true. And Beatrice, with her inherent suspicion of anything *too* perfect, knew deep down that something was rotten in the state of corporate Denmark.
