The damp chill of the attic studio clung to Adelaide Beatrice Finch like the scent of turpentine. Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of sunlight slicing through the grime-streaked window, illuminating the chaotic beauty of her workspace. Canvases stacked precariously against each other lined the walls, a silent gallery of unfinished dreams. Some were nearly complete, vibrant landscapes teeming with imagined flora and fauna. Others were barely begun, just a few bold strokes of crimson or a swirl of sapphire on a pale linen surface.

Outside, the rumble of London traffic was a muted counterpoint to the rhythmic squeak of Adelaide's worn leather boots against the creaking floorboards. Below, in the respectable Victorian townhouse that had been her family home for generations, her Aunt Mildred was likely preparing a bland luncheon of overcooked vegetables and polite conversation. Adelaide, however, preferred the company of her brushes and the quiet hum of inspiration that vibrated in the air up here, in her sanctuary at the top of the house. This was her world, a world where rules of perspective bent to her will and colors sang their own peculiar harmonies.
