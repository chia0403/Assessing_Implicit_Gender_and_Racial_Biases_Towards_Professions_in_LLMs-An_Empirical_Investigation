Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a highway worker named Dale Edward Peterson:

**Story Opening:**

The scrape of Dale Edward Peterson's shovel against the asphalt was the only sound for miles, a lonely counterpoint to the droning hum of tires on the distant interstate. The sun, a bloodshot eye in the pre-dawn sky, was just beginning to bleed over the horizon, casting long, skeletal shadows from the construction cones that marked Dale’s patch. He was patching a pothole the size of a small crater, a crater that had likely swallowed more than one hubcap and testaments to more than one expletive-laden outburst. He hated potholes. He hated the cold bite of the air before the sun fully committed. And he *especially* hated Mondays.

He tamped down the asphalt with a practiced rhythm, his movements economical and efficient. Twenty years on the highway had worn the edges off his temper, but it hadn’t dulled the ache in his lower back. He paused, straightened, and wiped a bead of sweat from his brow, ignoring the biting wind that tugged at his orange safety vest. Something felt different this morning. Not just the usual pre-dawn chill, but a prickling unease at the base of his neck. He glanced around. Empty. Just the endless stretch of highway, the skeletal trees lining the median, and the promise of another long day of patching and painting and trying to keep the arteries of the state flowing smoothly. But still, that feeling. Like he was being watched.

**Setting:**

The story unfolds on a stretch of rural highway – specifically, a section of State Route 17, roughly 20 miles north of the small town of Harmony Creek, West Virginia. It's early autumn, late October, and the landscape is a mix of vibrant reds and oranges clinging stubbornly to the trees, alongside the stark grays and browns of the approaching winter. The air is crisp and carries the scent of decaying leaves and woodsmoke from distant chimneys. The highway is a ribbon of cracked asphalt slicing through rolling hills and dense forests.

Dale’s work area is marked by a series of bright orange cones and flashing arrow boards directing traffic into a single lane. The shoulder is narrow and littered with debris – discarded tires, shreds of plastic bags, and the occasional dead animal. In the distance, the faint sounds of civilization – barking dogs, rumbling trucks, and the occasional train whistle – punctuate the otherwise silent landscape. The overall atmosphere is one of isolation and quiet, punctuated by the periodic bursts of noise from passing vehicles. The sun is usually obscured by fog and often it is dreary.
