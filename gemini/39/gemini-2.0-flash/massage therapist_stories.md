The rhythmic thump of ocean waves against the Malibu shore was supposed to be calming. Normally, Amelia Rose Dubois, owner and sole proprietor of "Amelia's Therapeutic Touch," found the ocean a balm to her frazzled nerves. But today, the sound only amplified the gnawing anxiety in her stomach. She stood on the patio of her beachfront cottage, the salty air whipping at her unruly auburn hair, watching a lone surfer ride a wave towards the shore. He made it look effortless, carefree. Amelia, on the other hand, felt anything but.

Her sanctuary, usually filled with the soothing scents of lavender and eucalyptus, felt claustrophobic. The plush massage table inside, draped in a crisp, white linen, seemed to mock her. Usually, her hands, honed through years of study and countless hours of practice, felt like extensions of her heart, capable of kneading away stress and pain. Today, they trembled slightly.

Ameliaâ€™s cottage, painted a soft, faded blue, was her pride and joy. It was more than just a home; it was her clinic, her escape, her everything. Built precariously close to the Pacific Coast Highway, it boasted breathtaking views and a constant influx of wealthy, stressed-out clients seeking respite from the pressures of Hollywood life. But that clientele, the very lifeblood of her business, was the source of her current unease. Today, she was scheduled to massage Alistair Blackwood, the notoriously demanding and impossibly handsome star of the latest blockbuster superhero franchise, and the thought was enough to make her palms sweat.
