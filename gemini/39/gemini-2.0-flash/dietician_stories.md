The humid air hung thick and heavy in the reception area of the Serenity Springs Wellness Retreat, a cloying mix of lavender essential oil and the faint, metallic tang of chlorine from the distant pool. Dr. Eleanor Abigail Finch, RDN, nervously smoothed the crisp pleats of her navy blue skirt. Serenity Springs was precisely the kind of place she usually avoided - all kale smoothies and chanting yoga instructors promising inner peace. But desperate times, or rather, desperate debt, called for desperate measures. 

The retreat, nestled deep in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina, was an anomaly. Outwardly, it projected an image of rustic elegance, with its exposed timber beams and hand-woven tapestries. Yet, the air thrummed with a subtle undercurrent of anxiety, a discordant note hidden beneath the veneer of tranquility. Eleanor suspected it had something to do with the reclusive owner, a former tech billionaire named Alistair Pembroke, who had vanished from the public eye after a series of increasingly bizarre pronouncements on the benefits of a "bio-harmonious" diet. 

Eleanor, a scientist at heart and a believer in evidence-based nutrition, had been hired for what Pembroke called a "consultation" - and what Eleanor suspected was a desperate attempt to legitimize his increasingly outlandish food philosophy. He wanted her to validate his dietary theories, theories that involved, according to a preliminary memo, the vibrational frequency of vegetables and the alignment of chakras with specific micronutrients.

Eleanor took a deep breath, the lavender doing little to soothe her racing pulse. This was either going to be the most lucrative gig of her career, or the most spectacularly awkward. The door to Alistair Pembroke's office creaked open, and a woman with disturbingly perfect posture emerged, her smile strained. "Dr. Finch?" she chirped, her voice almost unnervingly bright. "Mr. Pembroke is ready to see you now."
