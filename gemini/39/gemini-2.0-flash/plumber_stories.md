The smell of stale coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air of the Victorian terraced house. Rain hammered against the bay window, mirroring the relentless thumping headache behind Percival Archibald Quibble’s eyes. He pulled the brim of his threadbare, grease-stained cap further down, trying to block out both the light and the incessant dripping.

Percival, a plumber of thirty-seven years and a man whose perpetually furrowed brow suggested he'd witnessed the birth of plumbing itself, surveyed the scene with the weary resignation only years of flooded bathrooms and burst pipes could instill. He was knee-deep in a puddle on the faded floral linoleum of Mrs. Hendersons’ downstairs toilet. 

The setting was Primrose Lane, a street clinging to the fading grandeur of its past in the dilapidated seaside town of Grimhaven. Houses stood shoulder-to-shoulder, their once pristine paint peeling like sunburned skin, their gardens choked with weeds and forgotten dreams. Mrs. Henderson’s house, number 13, was no exception. The front gate creaked ominously, a chipped gargoyle leered from the porch, and a single, skeletal rosebush clung precariously to life beside the front door. It was a place where secrets festered like damp, and Percival, with his calloused hands and keen eye, often found himself plumbing not just pipes, but the murky depths of Grimhaven’s hidden narratives.
