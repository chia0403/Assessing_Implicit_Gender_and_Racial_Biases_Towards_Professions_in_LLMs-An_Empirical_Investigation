Okay, here's a story opening and setting, with the main character, a logger named Silas Finnigan:

**Story Opening:**

The biting November wind whipped through the towering pines, stinging Silas Finnigan’s cheeks and drawing tears to his eyes. He spat a wad of tobacco juice onto the frost-covered ground, the brown liquid instantly freezing into a small, unsightly splotch. He hated this time of year. The bone-deep cold slowed everything down – his hands, his movements, even his thoughts seemed to lumber along like a loaded skidder on a muddy slope. But the mills needed logs, and Silas needed the money. He hefted his chainsaw, the familiar weight a small comfort in the vast, unforgiving wilderness, and tightened his grip. Today, another giant would fall.

**Setting:**

The story is set in the remote, mountainous region of **Western Maine, specifically the area around the Chain of Ponds and the Canadian border**. The year is **1978**.

*   **Geography:** The landscape is dominated by dense forests of spruce, fir, pine, and birch, punctuated by steep, rocky inclines, deep ravines, and frigid, fast-flowing rivers. Scattered throughout are small, isolated logging camps, often rudimentary and spartan, built to house the seasonal influx of workers.

*   **Climate:** Harsh winters are typical, with heavy snowfall, sub-zero temperatures, and short daylight hours. Summers are brief but can be hot and humid. Spring and autumn are unpredictable, often bringing a mix of rain, sleet, and sudden temperature swings.

*   **Economy:** The region's economy is heavily reliant on logging and the paper industry. Mills in nearby towns like Millinocket and Rumford are the primary employers, and the health of the timber industry dictates the prosperity (or lack thereof) of the local communities.

*   **Culture:** The people are generally independent, resilient, and fiercely proud of their way of life. A strong work ethic is valued, and a deep connection to the land is ingrained. Outsiders are often viewed with suspicion, and a strong sense of tradition and self-reliance prevails.
