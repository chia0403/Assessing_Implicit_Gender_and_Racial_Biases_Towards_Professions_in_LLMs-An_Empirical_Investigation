## Story Opening:

The clatter of pans was Elara Maeve O’Connell’s morning symphony. Steam billowed from the copper pot on the stove, carrying the rich aroma of rosemary and garlic that clung to the exposed beams of the kitchen like a comforting blanket. The old farmhouse, built into the side of a cliff overlooking the turquoise embrace of the Irish Sea, hummed with a life all its own. A life, Elara thought wryly, that she was desperately trying to keep from falling into complete chaos. 

She glanced at the hand-written menu tacked to the worn oak cupboard door: "The Cliffside Hearth - Today's Specials - Seafood Chowder, Smoked Salmon Quiche, Blackberry & Apple Crumble." Another deep breath, and she flipped the perfectly crisped rasher of bacon with practiced ease. Tourists would be arriving soon, their city pallor hungry for sea air and Elara’s hearty, honest food. 

But today, the comforting rhythm of her kitchen felt discordant. There was a knot of worry tightening in her stomach, a dull ache that no amount of perfectly seasoned broth could soothe. The wind was picking up outside, rattling the ancient windowpanes in their frames like restless spirits. And as she turned to reach for the freshly churned butter, a single, black feather drifted down from the open rafters, landing silently on the counter beside her. Elara froze, a primal unease creeping into her bones. This wasn't just any feather. This was a harbinger.
