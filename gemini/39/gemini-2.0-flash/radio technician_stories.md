The crackle of static was more comforting to Eleanor Vance than the chirping of birds, the whisper of wind, or even the murmur of human conversation. It was a constant, a background hum against which she could calibrate her life. And tonight, in the belly of the WCKY AM transmitter shack, it was particularly loud, almost frantic.

The shack itself was a concrete bunker, squatting low on the windswept plains just outside Cincinnati. Built back in the station's heyday, when radio was king and WCKY boasted the strongest signal east of the Mississippi, it was now more graveyard than palace. Peeling paint clung to the walls like tired skin, revealing the pitted concrete beneath. Dust motes danced in the anemic glow of the single overhead fluorescent bulb, illuminating ranks of hulking vacuum tube amplifiers, their dials frozen at settings that hadn't changed since Elvis was on the radio. The air hung thick with the scent of ozone, aging metal, and the ghosts of broadcasts past. Rain lashed against the barred windows, a rhythmic drumming that only intensified the feeling of being utterly, wonderfully isolated. Tonight, Eleanor felt like she was the only person in the world holding onto the last vestiges of a forgotten technology, a flickering flame in the face of an encroaching digital storm.
