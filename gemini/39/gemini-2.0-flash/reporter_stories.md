## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, stinging the exposed skin of Amelia Thorne's face as she hurried towards the flickering neon sign of "O'Malley's Tap." It was late October in Chicago, the kind of late October that felt more like mid-November, and the air was thick with the smell of impending snow. O'Malley's, a dimly lit dive bar tucked away on a side street in Lincoln Park, offered the promise of warmth, cheap whiskey, and maybe, just maybe, a lead.

**Opening:** Amelia Thorne, the ink barely dry on her "Staff Reporter" card for the *Chicago Sun-Times*, jammed her hands deeper into the pockets of her worn leather jacket. She took a deep breath, the taste of exhaust and lake water clinging to the back of her throat. For the past three weeks, she'd been chasing rumors, whispers, and half-forgotten anecdotes about a string of disappearances plaguing the city's south side. Three young men, all connected to a low-level street gang known as the "Southside Serpents," had vanished without a trace. The police were treating it as gang-related infighting, another statistic lost in the city's sprawling crime blotter. But something didn't sit right with Amelia. There was a pattern, a chilling uniformity to the disappearances that hinted at something far more sinister than a simple turf war. And tonight, she hoped, O'Malley's held the key to unlocking the truth.
