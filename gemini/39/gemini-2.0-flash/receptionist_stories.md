## Story Opening:

The incessant hum of the fluorescent lights in the lobby was Amelia Rose Carter's daily lullaby. She knew it better than her own heartbeat, a monotonous drone punctuated only by the clatter of keyboards, the chirping of the phone, and the occasional awkward cough from a nervous client. Today, however, the familiar symphony felt discordant, grating. Amelia chewed on the end of her pen, her gaze fixed on the swirling snow outside the glass doors of Sterling & Stone Financial. It had been snowing for hours, a relentless blizzard that threatened to turn the usually bustling downtown streets into a frosted wasteland.

She sighed, the breath fogging a small patch on the otherwise spotless glass of the reception desk. Five o'clock couldn't come soon enough. Not just because she was weary of the same old routine, but because a gnawing anxiety had been building in her chest all afternoon. Mr. Sterling hadn't returned from his lunch meeting with a potential new investor, and with each passing hour, Amelia felt a growing sense of unease prickling at the back of her neck. Something felt… off.

## Setting:

The lobby of Sterling & Stone Financial was a testament to understated wealth and corporate polish. Cool, neutral tones dominated the decor, from the gray marble floor to the beige leather armchairs arranged around a low, glass-topped coffee table. A large, abstract painting in muted blues and grays hung on the wall behind Amelia's desk, its enigmatic swirls reflecting the turbulent weather outside. The desk itself was a gleaming expanse of dark wood, meticulously organized with a sleek phone, a leather-bound appointment book, and a small, silver nameplate that read: "Amelia Rose Carter, Receptionist." Beyond the lobby, frosted glass doors offered glimpses of busy offices, a maze of cubicles humming with the activity of financial analysts and administrative staff. The overall impression was one of quiet efficiency and unwavering success, a façade that Amelia knew sometimes concealed a more complex and volatile reality.
