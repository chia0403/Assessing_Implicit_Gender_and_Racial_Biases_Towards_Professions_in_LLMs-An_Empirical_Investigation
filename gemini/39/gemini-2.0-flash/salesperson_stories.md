## Story Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

Sweat trickled down Harold Edgar Finch's temples, despite the brisk November air whipping around him. He readjusted the knot of his tie, the cheap polyester chafing against his skin. He told himself it was nerves, not the two chili dogs he'd devoured for lunch, that were churning in his stomach. Today was a big day. A make-or-break day, really. If he didn't land this account, the words "downsizing" and "performance review" were going to be swirling around his cubicle like vultures. He took another deep breath, the icy air stinging his nostrils, and plastered on his most winning smile.

**Setting:**

The setting is the bustling industrial park of Meadowbrook, just outside of Chicago, Illinois, on a Tuesday morning in mid-November. A blanket of grey cloud hangs heavy overhead, promising snow later in the day. Harold is standing outside the gleaming, modern facade of "Innovatech Solutions," a company specializing in cutting-edge software solutions for manufacturing. The stark contrast between Innovatech's sleek glass and steel and the more utilitarian brick warehouses that surround it is not lost on Harold. He's acutely aware that he, a salesperson from the somewhat-less-cutting-edge "OfficePro Plus," a purveyor of office supplies and basic software, is about to enter the lions' den. The air is thick with the metallic tang of nearby factories and the rumble of delivery trucks navigating the potholed streets. He clutches his worn leather briefcase, its contents promising to revolutionize their stationery and breakroom game, and forces himself to take the first step towards the imposing glass doors. He just hopes Innovatech is as impressed with his meticulously crafted pitch as he is.
