Okay, here's a story opening and setting focusing on a graphic designer:

**Setting:** The story begins in the late afternoon, just as the relentless Chicago summer is beginning to loosen its grip. The sky is a bruised plum color, hinting at a coming thunderstorm. The air in the West Loop is thick with the smell of exhaust and grilling sausages from a nearby street vendor. Specifically, we're in the open-plan office of "Pixel Pusher Design," a trendy, loft-style space with exposed brick walls, high ceilings, and strategically placed succulents. The music, some sort of chill-hop instrumental, is just loud enough to be noticeable but not distracting.

**Opening:**

A vein pulsed in Amelia Josephine Rossi's forehead as she stared, unblinking, at the screen. The logo for "Squeaky Clean Chimneys," a local chimney sweeping company, leered back at her. It was supposed to evoke warmth, reliability, and… well, cleanliness. Instead, it resembled a soot-covered snowman committing some vaguely suggestive act with a chimney brush.

She’d already gone through twenty-seven iterations, each progressively worse than the last. The client, a Mr. Bartholomew Filch, had rejected every single one, citing reasons that ranged from “not quite whimsical enough” to “evokes a distinct feeling of impending doom.”

Amelia sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. Her ergonomic chair groaned in protest as she leaned back. Mr. Filch was her Waterloo. He was the artistic equivalent of a hangnail – small, insignificant, and unbelievably irritating. And he was due back in fifteen minutes for another review.

She glanced around the office. Her colleagues were blissfully engrossed in their own projects, oblivious to her impending professional demise. Across the room, Ben was tweaking the shading on a series of photorealistic avocados for a guacamole ad. Lucky bastard. Even avocados were less soul-crushing than chimneys at this point.

Amelia closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and prepared to face the chimney-sweeping apocalypse. Fifteen minutes. That's all she had to conjure some semblance of design genius before Mr. Filch arrived, ready to unleash another torrent of whimsical demands. The storm outside seemed to be gathering momentum, mirroring the tempest brewing within her. Maybe, just maybe, a bolt of lightning would strike the building and erase the Squeaky Clean Chimneys file from existence. A girl could dream.
