Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a main character who is an editor:

**Setting:** A cramped, cluttered apartment in the heart of Brooklyn, New York. Sunlight struggles to penetrate the grimy windows, barely illuminating stacks of manuscripts teetering precariously on every available surface. The air hangs thick with the scent of stale coffee, old paper, and a faint hint of desperation.

**Story Opening:**

The insistent shrill of the alarm clock ripped Eleanor Abigail Thorne from a dream about talking cats and grammatical errors. She groaned, swatting blindly at the bedside table until her hand connected with the offending device. Silence. Blessed, glorious silence. For five seconds. Then the phone started buzzing, a relentless vibration against the worn wooden surface.

"Ugh," Eleanor mumbled, her voice raspy from disuse and the lingering taste of cheap Merlot. She glanced at the illuminated screen. Another email from Harold Peterson, the notoriously difficult and increasingly delusional author of "The Cosmic Compost Heap: A Philosophical Journey Through Vegetable Matter."  Eleanor already knew what it would say: another rambling, incoherent demand for her to "understand the profound beauty of rotting zucchini" and a veiled threat to take his manuscript to a *real* publishing house.

Eleanor Thorne, Senior Editor at Parnassus Quill Publishing (a title that sounded far grander than the reality of her cramped office and dwindling salary), considered throwing the phone out the window. But she knew she wouldn't. Harold Peterson, despite being a raving lunatic, was their only shot at making any money this quarter. And Eleanor Abigail Thorne, in her own quiet, book-loving way, was not about to let Parnassus Quill sink without a fight.  She just needed another cup of coffee. And maybe a shot of something stronger.
