Okay, here's a story opening and setting:

**Setting:**

The biting March wind whipped off the North Sea, stinging Agnes Carmichael’s cheeks as she wrestled with the stubbornly stuck latch of the bakery’s back door. “Blast it all!” she muttered, her breath misting in the frigid air. The small Scottish fishing village of Port Dunhaven was a picture postcard of rugged beauty, all grey stone cottages huddled against the relentless sea, but on days like this, it felt more like a punishment. Her tiny bakery, "Agnes' Aye-Aye Pies," clung to the cliffside, its windows plastered with hand-drawn signs advertising freshly baked savoury pies and sweet treats. The interior, however, was a warm, fragrant haven of cinnamon, shortbread, and simmering meat fillings.

**Opening:**

Agnes Carmichael finally wrestled the door open, its hinges groaning in protest. She shoved a stray strand of fiery red hair behind her ear and stomped inside, the familiar warmth of the bakery embracing her like a welcome hug. She barely had time to shed her heavy woolen coat before the bell above the shop door jingled, announcing her first customer of the day. It was old Mr. MacTavish, the village butcher, his face ruddy and creased with wrinkles that told a lifetime of sea stories. “Morning, Agnes, lass,” he boomed, his voice thick with a Highland burr. “Just thought I’d pop in for one of your famous Scotch pies. Heard you’ve been experimentin’ again.” Agnes Carmichael smiled, a warm, genuine smile that lit up her face. “Aye, Mr. MacTavish. And I think I've finally cracked the code on the perfect pepper sauce to go with it."
