## Opening and Setting:

The stale scent of antiseptic and stale coffee clung to the air of the Evergreen Rehabilitation Center, a smell Dr. Anya Petrova knew intimately. It was a smell that permeated her skin, her clothes, and sometimes, she swore, even her dreams. Outside, the Seattle rain hammered against the large windows, blurring the already muted gray landscape. Anya watched a lone crow struggle against the wind, its dark silhouette a stark contrast against the swirling mist.

She took another sip of her lukewarm coffee, the metallic tang doing little to cut through the fog in her brain. It was 7:00 AM, her shift had officially started, and she was already behind. Ms. Henderson, the fiercely independent, seventy-year-old retired librarian with a freshly replaced hip, was waiting impatiently in the therapy gym. Anya knew Ms. Henderson wouldn't appreciate being kept waiting, especially not today, when they were supposed to be tackling the dreaded stairs.

Anya straightened her crisp white coat, the familiar weight reassuring. She smoothed down her dark, practical braid, and forced a smile. Time to face the music, and the stairs. Today, she thought, she would conquer both.
