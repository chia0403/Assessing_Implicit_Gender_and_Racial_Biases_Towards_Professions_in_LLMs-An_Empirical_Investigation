## Story Opening:

The scent of sawdust and cheap hairspray, a potent cocktail that always managed to both invigorate and nauseate him, hung heavy in the air. Bartholomew "Bart" Finch, Artistic Director of the barely-solvent Phoenix Repertory Theatre, pinched the bridge of his nose, trying to ward off the headache blooming behind his eyes. Outside, the rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless percussion that threatened to drown out even the echoes of his own despair. He knew, without looking, that the leak above the stage left was steadily growing into a puddle, a shimmering, metaphorical reflection of the play he was about to direct: a disastrously ambitious adaptation of *Moby Dick* set in a dystopian steampunk future.

The funding had fallen through, their star actress had eloped with a rodeo clown, and the whaling-submarine built entirely out of recycled bicycle parts was currently held together with more gaffer tape than actual metal. It was, in short, a catastrophe.

He took a long, shaky breath and surveyed his kingdom of chaos.

## Setting:

The Phoenix Repertory Theatre was located in the forgotten industrial district of Oakhaven, a city slowly succumbing to urban sprawl and a crippling lack of artistic funding. Nestled between a derelict lumber mill and a perpetually-burning tire factory, the theatre was a testament to stubborn optimism and a whole lot of elbow grease.

Inside, the theatre was a bizarre tapestry of mismatched furniture salvaged from flea markets, stained velvet curtains that had seen better days, and a labyrinthine network of catwalks and rigging that creaked ominously with every gust of wind. The paint on the walls was peeling, revealing layers of past productions - a sliver of emerald green from *Wicked*, a splash of crimson from *Macbeth*, a ghostly smear of white from a particularly ambitious staging of *Waiting for Godot*.

The stage itself, bathed in the harsh glare of a single bare bulb, was currently a graveyard of half-finished props and discarded costume pieces. A giant, skeletal whale tail, constructed from bamboo and tattered canvas, leaned precariously against the back wall, threatening to topple over at any moment. The air crackled with a sense of desperate energy, a potent mix of fear and exhilaration that only a theatre teetering on the brink of ruin could produce.
