Okay, here's a story opening and setting:

**Setting:** The grimy, fluorescent-lit waiting room of the "New Horizons Rehabilitation Center" in a struggling district of Cincinnati, Ohio. Itâ€™s late afternoon, and the autumnal light struggling through the barred windows does little to soften the atmosphere of weariness and quiet desperation. The chairs, scarred and stained with countless encounters, are mostly empty. The air hangs thick with the faint smell of stale coffee and regret.

**Story Opening:**

Margaret Elizabeth Davies sighed, the sound barely audible over the hum of the ancient fluorescent bulbs. She pinched the bridge of her nose, the dull ache behind her eyes a familiar companion at this hour. Four o'clock. Her last appointment of the day. Hopefully. Sometimes these things ran long. She glanced at the security camera nestled in the corner, a silent, unblinking eye that felt both protective and accusing.

She hated this waiting room. Hated the defeated slump of shoulders, the averted gazes, the way the air itself seemed to vibrate with unspoken stories of bad choices and broken promises. Margaret had dedicated ten years of her life to helping people navigate this system, to offering a hand up, a listening ear, a chance to rebuild. But some days, like today, the weight of it all pressed down on her, threatening to suffocate her beneath the sheer volume of human fallibility.

A raspy cough broke through her thoughts. A young man, no older than twenty, sat hunched over in a far corner, fidgeting with the laces of his worn-out sneakers. He was probably nervous. They all were, at first. Margaret steeled herself, smoothed the wrinkles from her sensible grey skirt, and forced a smile. It was time to face whatever waited behind door number three. Time to be a beacon, however dim, in this particular corner of the darkness.
