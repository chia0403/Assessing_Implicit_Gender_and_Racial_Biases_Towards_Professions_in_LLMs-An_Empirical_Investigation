The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune above Penelope Amelia Higgins as she scanned a can of creamed corn. The bell above the automatic doors of "Larry's Liquors and Ladies' Lingerie," a notoriously bizarre combination store in the even more bizarre town of Harmony Creek, Ohio, chimed merrily, announcing a new arrival. Penelope barely glanced up, her gaze focused on the customer in front of her - a man with a handlebar mustache sculpted with the precision of an architect and an armful of... well, as the store name suggested, some rather lacy undergarments.

Harmony Creek was nestled deep in the rolling hills of southeastern Ohio, a place where time seemed to move slower and the gossip moved faster. It was a town steeped in local legends, from the whispered tales of the Harmony Creek Monster that supposedly lurked in the nearby woods, to the more believable story of the town's founder, Bartholomew Harmony, who was rumored to have made his fortune selling miracle elixirs of dubious efficacy. Larry's Liquors and Ladies' Lingerie was, in many ways, a microcosm of the town itself - a strange, slightly off-kilter collection of the mundane and the eccentric, all under one roof. And Penelope, with her quiet demeanor and love of classic literature, was the steady, if slightly bewildered, anchor in the middle of it all.
