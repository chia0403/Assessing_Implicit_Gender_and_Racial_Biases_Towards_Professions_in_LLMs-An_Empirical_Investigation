The humid air hung heavy and thick, clinging to Amelia Rose Thorne like a shroud. It smelled of salt, diesel, and something vaguely floral, a strange concoction that was uniquely Port Isabella. Amelia, her linen pants clinging uncomfortably to her legs, squinted against the glare bouncing off the turquoise water. The sun beat down on the ramshackle docks, painting everything in a hazy, almost dreamlike quality. 

Port Isabella, a forgotten corner of the Virgin Islands, was a place where time seemed to move at a different pace. Pastel-colored houses, their paint peeling like sunburnt skin, lined the waterfront. Fishermen mended nets, their faces etched with the hardships of a life dictated by the sea. Stray dogs, ribs visible beneath mangy fur, scavenged for scraps in the dusty streets. It was a far cry from the gleaming towers and sterile newsrooms of New York City, a place Amelia had gladly left behind, at least for a few weeks. She was here, officially, on assignment for "Global Inquirer," to write a puff piece about the island's budding eco-tourism industry. Unofficially, she was hunting a ghost. A story that had vanished into the Caribbean Sea ten years ago. A story she desperately needed to resurrect.
