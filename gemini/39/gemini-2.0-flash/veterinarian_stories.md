## Story Opening:

The biting wind, laced with the metallic tang of the nearby quarry, whipped strands of Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Vance's auburn hair across her face. She pulled her worn Carhartt jacket tighter, the familiar scent of livestock and disinfectant clinging to the fabric, a comfort against the approaching twilight. The fading light cast long, skeletal shadows from the twisted branches of the ancient oak that stood sentinel at the edge of the field, its gnarled limbs clawing at the bruised, purple sky. Across the uneven, frost-dusted pasture, nestled between the oak and the looming, jagged scar of the quarry, stood Oakhaven Farm, a place Ellie knew intimately â€“ and tonight, it felt heavy with a silent dread.

**Setting:**

The story takes place in the rural, sparsely populated county of Blackwood, nestled in the Appalachian foothills of Western Pennsylvania. Specifically, the opening scene is set on Oakhaven Farm, a struggling dairy farm owned by the aging Mr. Silas Oakhaven. The farm is small, bordered on one side by a vast, privately-owned quarry that has been slowly encroaching on its land for decades. The landscape is rugged and beautiful, characterized by rolling hills, dense forests, and a pervasive sense of isolation. The nearest town, Blackwood Crossroads, is a sleepy hamlet with a general store, a post office, and a dwindling population.
