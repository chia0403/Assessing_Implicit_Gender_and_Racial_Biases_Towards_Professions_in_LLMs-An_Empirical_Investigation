The rain hammered against the Georgian windows of Oakhaven Manor, each gust rattling the panes like a skeletal hand seeking entry. Inside, a fire roared in the hearth, casting flickering shadows that danced across the oak-panelled walls and illuminated dust motes suspended in the air. The scent of aged leather, woodsmoke, and damp wool hung heavy, a comforting, familiar perfume to **Eleanor Abigail Thorne**, bestselling author of gothic mysteries and Oakhaven's sole occupant.

Eleanor, perched precariously on a ladder, was surrounded by stacks of yellowed manuscripts and first editions, her silver hair escaping its loose bun in wisps that framed her face. She reached for a particularly tattered volume, its spine cracked and the title almost illegible. "The Raven's Curse," it read, barely visible beneath the grime. Perfect. Tonight was the night she'd finally delve into the forgotten lore of Oakhaven, the very manor that had inspired her best-selling series, "The Blackwood Legacy." Perhaps, within its pages, lay the key to breaking the writer's block that had gripped her for months, a block as impenetrable as the storm raging outside.
