## Story Opening & Setting

**Setting:** The wind howled a mournful dirge through the narrow streets of San Martino di Lota, a village clinging stubbornly to the steep, sun-drenched slopes of Corsica. Whitewashed houses, stacked one atop another like precarious dice, seemed to lean into the brutal gusts that swept down from Monte Capra. The air, thick with the scent of salt, wild rosemary, and damp stone, stung the face. Winter's grip was loosening, but not without a fight.

**Story Opening:**

A cloud of white dust billowed around the powerful arms of Alessandro Benedetti, momentarily obscuring the jagged profile of his face. He spat, clearing the grit from his throat, and readjusted the heavy goggles perched precariously on his nose. Sunlight, briefly escaping the clutches of the encroaching storm clouds, illuminated the rough-hewn slab of granite before him. He was wrestling with a particularly stubborn vein of quartz that snaked through the stone like a frozen lightning bolt. Alessandro, the village's most respected, and arguably most temperamental, stone cutter, grunted with exertion as he raised his mallet once more. The rhythmic clang of steel against stone, a sound as familiar and comforting as his own heartbeat, was his only companion in the pre-dawn gloom. He had promised Madame Rossi a new headstone for her late husband, Pascal, by the Saint's Day festival, and Alessandro Benedetti was a man who kept his promises. Even if it meant battling the unforgiving Corsican landscape, and the equally unforgiving quirks of the stone itself. This slab, however, was proving particularly recalcitrant, and Alessandro felt a familiar tide of frustration begin to rise within him. If this blasted quartz didn't yield soon, Pascal Rossi might be waiting a good while longer for his final resting place.
