The biting wind whipped across the barren landscape of the Nevada desert, kicking up dust devils that danced like restless spirits in the headlights of a hundred approaching semis. Inside the cab of his eighteen-wheeler, a monstrous Peterbilt named 'The Wanderer,' Jedediah "Jed" Ezekiel Stone shivered despite the thick flannel lining his faded denim jacket. He squinted at the flickering dashboard clock - 3:17 AM. Just past Barstow. Another hundred miles before he could pull into the promised oasis of the Flying J in Vegas and grab some lukewarm coffee strong enough to dissolve nails.

The cab itself was a testament to Jed's life on the road. A meticulously organized chaos reigned. Maps, dog-eared and coffee-stained, spilled from the glove compartment. A well-worn copy of "Moby Dick" lay open on the passenger seat, a bookmark holding his place in Ahab's relentless pursuit. Empty coffee cups, a graveyard of fleeting caffeine fixes, rattled in the cup holders. The air hung thick with the smell of diesel, stale cigarettes, and a faint, lingering scent of pine air freshener â€“ a desperate attempt to mask the other two. This was his home, his office, his confessional, and his sanctuary. And tonight, as the wind howled outside and the miles melted away under his tires, it felt particularly lonely.
