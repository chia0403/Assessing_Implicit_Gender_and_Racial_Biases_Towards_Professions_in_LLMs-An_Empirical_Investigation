Okay, here's a story opening and setting, focusing on a pharmacist named Beatrice Willowbrook.

**Opening:**

The bell above the door of Willowbrook Pharmacy tinkled with a tired resignation, much like Beatrice Willowbrook herself felt. She glanced up from her meticulous arrangement of cough drops, her brow furrowed slightly. It was close to closing, the late afternoon sun casting long, skeletal shadows across the linoleum floor. She knew who it was before she even saw him. Mr. Henderson, a fixture in the pharmacy like the faded photos of medicinal herbs hanging on the back wall, always came in for his heart medication precisely twenty minutes before she locked up. Tonight, however, he was flanked by two men she didn't recognize, their faces hidden beneath the brims of identical, dark hats.

A prickle of unease traced a path down Beatrice's spine. She plastered a practiced, albeit weary, smile on her face and straightened her crisply starched white coat. "Good evening, Mr. Henderson. And to whom do I owe the pleasure of this... *entourage*?"

**Setting:**

Willowbrook Pharmacy was a comforting, if somewhat dated, establishment nestled on the corner of Elm and Oak Streets in the sleepy, almost forgotten town of Havenwood, Maine. The building itself was a two-story brick structure, weathered by decades of harsh winters and salty sea air. The upper floor, where Beatrice lived, boasted charming dormers and flower boxes overflowing with petunias â€“ a stark contrast to the slightly peeling paint and flickering neon sign below.

Inside, the aroma of beeswax polish, dried herbs, and just a hint of antiseptic created a unique and nostalgic atmosphere. Shelves lined the walls, stocked with everything from pain relievers and bandages to locally made soaps and artisanal honey. Behind the prescription counter, a meticulously organized array of amber bottles and dispensing equipment spoke to Beatrice's dedication and precision. A vintage cash register, a relic from her grandfather's time, sat proudly on the counter, a testament to the pharmacy's long and deeply rooted history within the community. The overall ambiance was one of quiet competence and genuine care, a beacon of stability in a world that seemed to be constantly changing.
