Okay, hereâ€™s a story opening and setting, featuring a chiropractor named Eleanor Vance:

**Setting:** The waiting room of Vance Chiropractic & Wellness, nestled in a meticulously restored Victorian house in the historic district of Havenwood, Maine. Sunlight streamed through the stained-glass window depicting a flock of puffins taking flight. The aroma of lavender and peppermint hung in the air, mingling with the subtle scent of wood polish from the antique furniture. Soft Celtic music played at a barely audible volume. The magazines on the coffee table were neatly organized, featuring titles ranging from "Backyard Birding" to "National Geographic Traveler," and significantly, *not* any medical publications.

**Story Opening:**

The rhythmic clacking of knitting needles was the only sound breaking the peace. Eleanor Vance, D.C., sat in her usual corner armchair, a vibrant skein of teal yarn pooling in her lap. She was working on a bulky cowl, a practical necessity for the harsh Maine winters, but truthfully, more of a distraction from the knot of anxiety tightening in her chest. The clock on the mantel chimed ten, a sound Eleanor usually found comforting, but today it felt like a hammer blow, each chime echoing the dwindling minutes before her first patient of the day. Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins, a lobsterman known more for his tall tales than his tenderness toward his spine, was due any minute. Eleanor sighed, burying her fingers deeper into the yarn. It wasn't Bart himself that worried her; it was the lingering unease, the premonition that had been dogging her since dawn. Something about today felt different, heavy with a silent expectancy that she couldn't shake. She cast on another stitch, a silent plea for the day to unfold normally, uneventfully. But deep down, Eleanor knew that in a town like Havenwood, "normal" was a myth, a story whispered only to tourists. And Havenwood, like the human spine, had a knack for throwing the unexpected into the mix.
