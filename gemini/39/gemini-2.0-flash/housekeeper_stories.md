The scent of beeswax polish hung heavy in the air, a testament to Mrs. Hawthorneâ€™s obsessive hand. For Eloise Beatrice Finch, however, it was merely Tuesday. Tuesday meant dusting the grotesquely ornate cherubs that clung to the ceilings of Hawthorne Manor, a task Eloise loathed almost as much as polishing the silver.

Hawthorne Manor, a looming gothic monstrosity of grey stone and perpetually shadowed windows, stood sentinel on the windswept cliffs overlooking the Cornish coastline. Built in the late 18th century by a shipping magnate with more money than sense, it was a place of echoing halls, drafty corridors, and enough antique furniture to fill a museum. Each room felt steeped in history, or rather, a suffocating sense of stagnation. The sea, a constant, restless presence outside, seemed to mock the still, unchanging atmosphere within.

Eloise, armed with a feather duster that looked woefully inadequate against the sheer scale of the place, sighed. The waves crashed below, a rhythmic roar that both soothed and irritated her. She adjusted her sensible shoes, a pair of sturdy brown brogues that had seen better days, and began her ascent of the rickety stepladder. Today, she was tackling the cherubs in the Grand Ballroom, a room usually reserved for dust motes and the ghosts of debutantes long past. It was a room that felt more like a mausoleum than a place of celebration, and Eloise, with her practical, no-nonsense approach to life, found it all rather depressing.
