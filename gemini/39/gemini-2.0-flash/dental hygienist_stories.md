Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a dental hygienist named Beatrice Eleanor Higgins:

**Setting:** The fictional coastal town of Seabreeze, Maine. Specifically, the brightly lit, slightly sterile examination room #2 in "Smiles by the Sea Dental," overlooking a windswept harbor.

**Opening:**

The metallic tang of fluoride hung heavy in the air, battling with the fainter, more persistent scent of Mrs. Gable's rose-scented lipstick. Beatrice Eleanor Higgins, her face partially obscured by the magnification loupes she wore like oversized spectacles, expertly scraped at a stubborn patch of tartar near Mrs. Gable's lower incisors. A faint breeze, carrying the cries of gulls and the distant drone of a fishing boat, rattled the windowpane behind her.

"Almost done, Mrs. Gable," Beatrice murmured, her voice muffled behind the disposable mask. "Just a little bit of vacation evidence here. All those delicious lobster rolls finally taking their toll, I presume?"

Mrs. Gable, a woman whose wrinkles told tales of countless sunny days spent on the deck of her sailboat, chuckled, the sound like dry leaves rustling in the autumn wind. "You know me too well, Beatrice. Besides, what's a trip to Maine without indulging? A little tartar is a small price to pay for happiness, wouldn't you agree?"

Beatrice straightened, removing the loupes and setting them on the rolling instrument tray with a soft *clink*. She rinsed the ultrasonic scaler, its high-pitched whine silenced, and took a moment to gaze out the window. The harbor was alive with activity: lobster boats chugging out to sea, sailboats leaning into the wind, and tourists milling about on the docks. Seabreeze, usually a haven of predictable tranquility, felt strangely…charged today.

"Happiness is definitely worth something," Beatrice agreed, turning back to Mrs. Gable with a warm smile. But as she met the older woman’s gaze, she couldn’t shake the unsettling feeling that something more than just vacation-induced plaque was about to disrupt the peaceful rhythm of their lives. Something significant, and perhaps, something dangerous, was brewing in Seabreeze. And Beatrice, she suspected with a prickle of unease, was about to find herself right in the middle of it.
