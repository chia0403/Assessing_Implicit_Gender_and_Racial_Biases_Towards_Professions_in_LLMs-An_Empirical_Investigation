## Story Opening:

The salt-laced wind whipped around Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne, tugging at the silk scarf she’d carelessly knotted at her throat. It was a losing battle, she knew, watching the fabric billow like a rebellious sail. But then, Amelia had always been drawn to battles, especially those against conventional expectations. Even her architectural designs, lauded for their elegance and flow, often housed a quiet rebellion against the mundane.

She braced herself against the weathered railing of the ferry, her gaze fixed on the Isle of Skye looming in the distance. Its jagged peaks, shrouded in mist and legend, pierced the horizon like the teeth of a sleeping giant. Amelia shivered, not entirely from the cold. There was something ancient and unsettling about this place, a raw energy that both intimidated and invigorated her.

She reached into her leather satchel, pulling out a dog-eared notebook filled with sketches and calculations. Skye. The place where her great-aunt Elspeth had spent her final, reclusive years. The place where Elspeth had, inexplicably, bequeathed Amelia a crumbling, uninhabitable croft.

"Crazy old woman," Amelia murmured to herself, her breath misting in the air. But even as she said the words, a flicker of excitement danced in her chest. Elspeth hadn’t just left her a ruin; she'd left her a challenge. And Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne, architect extraordinaire, never backed down from a challenge.

## Setting:

The story begins on a blustery, overcast day on a ferry approaching the Isle of Skye, Scotland. The ferry is a modest vessel, the kind used primarily by locals and the occasional intrepid tourist. The sea is choppy, and the air is thick with the smell of salt and damp peat. The Isle of Skye itself is visible in the distance, a rugged landscape dominated by dramatic mountain ranges, windswept moorlands, and rocky coastlines. The general atmosphere is one of stark beauty, isolation, and a lingering sense of history and folklore. The weather, predictably unpredictable, adds to the air of mystery and wildness that permeates the island.
