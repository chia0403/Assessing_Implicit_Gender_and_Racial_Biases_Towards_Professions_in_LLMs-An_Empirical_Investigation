The oppressive humidity clung to grease and grime like a second skin, plastering strands of Amelia Grace Rodriguez's dark hair to her forehead. The scent of burnt rubber and motor oil hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume that both comforted and choked her. It was a Tuesday, already pushing 90 degrees by 9 AM, and the sun beat down mercilessly on the corrugated iron roof of Rodriguez Garage, a weathered, ramshackle haven nestled on the outskirts of Harmony Creek, Texas.

Harmony Creek, population 2,800, was the kind of place where everyone knew your business and your mother's maiden name. It was also the kind of place where a good mechanic was worth their weight in gold, especially during the scorching summer months when vintage air conditioners sputtered and died more often than fireflies on a windshield. Amelia, or "Amy" as most folks called her, was, by all accounts, *the* good mechanic. She could coax a cough out of a dead engine and diagnose a problem by the way the exhaust smelled. Today, however, even her magic touch seemed to be faltering against the onslaught of the summer heat and the sheer volume of broken-down pickups lined up outside her garage. The air hung thick and still, broken only by the rhythmic clang of Amelia's wrench against a stubbornly seized bolt.
