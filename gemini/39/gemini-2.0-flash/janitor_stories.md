The fluorescent lights hummed a relentless, monotonous tune that bounced off the linoleum floor. It was 2:17 AM, and the vast, echoing halls of the National Museum of Prehistoric Creatures were shrouded in a silence deeper than the primordial ooze from which its exhibits were born. Only the rhythmic swoosh of a mop and the drip, drip, drip of a leaky faucet in the paleontological lab dared to break the spell.

Eugene Archibald Finch, a man whose life mirrored the beige walls he scrubbed, sighed. His mop, a trusty companion in the wee hours, left a gleaming trail in its wake, reflecting the ghostly light. He paused, wiping a bead of sweat from his brow with the back of his hand. The museum, usually teeming with wide-eyed children and hushed adults, now felt like a silent, sleeping giant, filled with the bones of creatures long extinct. And Eugene, a small, unassuming figure in his navy blue uniform, was the night watchman, the custodian of their silent slumber.
