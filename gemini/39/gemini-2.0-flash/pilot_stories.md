Okay, here's a story opening with a setting and a main character:

**Opening:**

The scream of the wind was a familiar lullaby to Amelia "Echo" Hayes, a constant companion that always seemed to whisper secrets she couldn't quite decipher. Today, though, the wind wasn't whispering. It was roaring, battering her little Cessna 172 like a child shaking a snow globe. She gripped the control yoke tighter, knuckles white, and fought the gusts that threatened to shove her off course. Ahead, the monochrome landscape of the Alaskan bush blurred through the rain-streaked windscreen, making her feel like she was flying through a watercolor painting gone wrong.

**Setting:**

The story opens in the rugged, remote expanse of the Alaskan Interior, specifically a hundred miles northwest of Fairbanks. The landscape is dominated by vast stretches of boreal forest interspersed with icy rivers, rocky outcrops, and frozen tundra. Scattered across this wilderness are small, isolated communities reachable only by air or, in winter, by snowmobile. The weather is notoriously unpredictable, shifting from clear skies to blizzards in a matter of hours. Many bush pilots call this area home, their lives are interwoven with the precarious balance of survival in this harsh environment.

**Main Character:**

**Amelia "Echo" Hayes:** A woman in her late twenties, Amelia inherited her father's small air charter business after his tragic death. Known locally as "Echo" because of her uncanny ability to find her way in even the most disorienting weather conditions, she is independent, resourceful, and deeply connected to the Alaskan wilderness. While fiercely competent in the air, she often struggles with the emotional weight of her responsibilities and the lingering grief over her father's passing.
