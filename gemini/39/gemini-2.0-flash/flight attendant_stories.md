## Story Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

The sudden, sharp drop threw Eleanor Grace Ainsworth against the galley counter, sending a cascade of miniature liquor bottles tumbling onto the floor. A collective gasp rippled through the cabin of TransOceanic Flight 804, followed by the squeals of a toddler and a hurried "Everything's alright!" from the cockpit. Eleanor gripped the edge of the stainless steel counter, her knuckles white, forcing a smile as she righted herself. "Just a little turbulence, folks!" she called out, her voice echoing professionally through the suddenly silent cabin. "We'll be through it in a jiffy." Lies, of course. She could feel it in her gut, the same gnawing unease she'd felt during that harrowing landing in a sudden monsoon over Bangkok last year. This felt different. This felt wrong.

**Setting:**

The interior of TransOceanic Flight 804, a Boeing 777-300ER, is a study in muted greys and blues. The seats, upholstered in a durable, but uninspired, fabric, are arranged in a 3-3-3 configuration. The overhead bins, crammed with overstuffed carry-ons, reflect the fluorescent glow of the cabin lighting. It's a standard transatlantic flight, the air thick with the recirculated breath of hundreds of passengers and the faint, metallic tang of jet fuel. Eleanor is stationed in the aft galley, a cramped space dominated by a coffee machine and a trolley laden with duty-free goods. Outside the small porthole window, the sky is a vast, unforgiving expanse of deep indigo, punctuated only by the blinking navigation lights of distant aircraft. They are approximately six hours into their flight from London Heathrow to Miami International Airport, somewhere over the featureless, icy plains of the North Atlantic.
