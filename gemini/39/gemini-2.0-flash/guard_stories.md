Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a guard named... let's go with...

**Setting:**

The setting is the rain-soaked, cobblestone courtyard of Grimstone Prison. Built into the side of a sheer cliff face, Grimstone is less a building and more a carved-out cavern. The air hangs heavy with the stench of damp stone, despair, and the faint, metallic tang of blood. Lanterns flicker weakly, their light barely piercing the oppressive gloom and reflecting in the puddles that gather in every uneven surface. The only constant sounds are the mournful cries of gulls circling overhead and the rhythmic clang of a distant hammer – the ironworks in the deepest levels where the most dangerous inmates are perpetually chained and subdued.

**Opening:**

The chill wind whipped around Sergeant Alistair Thorne, tugging at the edges of his heavy, leather-bound greatcoat and stinging his face with icy rain. He pulled the collar higher, his knuckles white as he gripped the worn haft of his halberd. Another night, another unending shift guarding the main gate of Grimstone. The rain made the cobblestones slick and treacherous, and the flickering lamplight cast dancing shadows that seemed to writhe with the trapped souls within. Alistair hated nights like these. It wasn’t the cold, or the damp, or even the oppressive atmosphere of the prison that bothered him most. It was the silence. A silence so profound, it felt as if the very stones were holding their breath, waiting for something terrible to break. He shifted his weight, his boots crunching on the damp stone, the sound echoing far too loudly in the empty courtyard. He wished something – anything – would happen to break the monotony. He should be careful what he wished for.
