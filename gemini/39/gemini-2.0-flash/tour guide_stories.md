The humid air hung heavy, a suffocating blanket woven with the scent of frangipani and diesel fumes. Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne, dressed in her perpetually-wrinkled khaki shorts and a batik shirt that did little to hide the sweat beading on her brow, squinted at the gaggle of tourists assembled before her. They were a motley crew: a trio of suspiciously tanned Germans, a couple honeymooning (or perhaps just perpetually arguing) Americans, and a lone, bookish woman who looked like she'd rather be anywhere else.

Amelia, officially licensed tour guide number 73 within the Phnom Penh historical district, tapped her clipboard against her thigh and plastered on her most enthusiastic smile. "Welcome, everyone, to Phnom Penh! I'm Amelia, and I'll be your guide today as we explore the wonders of the Royal Palace. Get ready to step back in time, witness the grandeur of the Khmer kings, andâ€¦" she trailed off, noticing the Americans were now openly bickering about sunscreen. She sighed inwardly. Another day, another battle against heat, humidity, and the universal inability of tourists to simply appreciate the beauty around them.

The setting was the expansive, sun-drenched courtyard just outside the Silver Pagoda entrance, nestled within the sprawling Royal Palace complex of Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Ornate golden stupas pierced the azure sky, their reflections shimmering in the meticulously maintained ponds. Frangipani trees offered a meager sliver of shade, their delicate white blossoms releasing a heady perfume that was both intoxicating and, in this heat, slightly nauseating. The air thrummed with the sounds of tuk-tuks sputtering in the distance and the rhythmic chanting from a nearby temple, a constant reminder of the vibrant culture that clung to life even amidst the throngs of selfie-snapping visitors. This was Amelia's stage, and today, she had to play her part.
