Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a concierge named:

**Story Opening:**

The chipped porcelain mug warmed Barnaby Plumtart's hands, its floral design a faded echo of the grandeur that permeated the Hotel Bellweather. Outside, the November wind howled a mournful symphony against the frosted windows of the lobby, rattling the ornate chandeliers and making the plush, crimson velvet ropes shiver. Barnaby took a slow, deliberate sip of Earl Grey, letting the bergamot notes briefly soothe the gnawing anxiety that had taken root in his chest. He’d been Concierge at the Bellweather for twenty-seven years, seen royalty and revolutionaries, movie stars and moguls pass through its gilded doors, and he prided himself on his unflappability. But tonight, the silence was too heavy, the shadows too long. The usual pre-holiday bustle was conspicuously absent. And the phone, usually ringing off the hook with last-minute reservation requests, remained ominously still. It felt…wrong. Dreadfully, bone-chillingly wrong. Then, a single, deliberate footstep echoed from the grand staircase, and Barnaby felt a chill that had nothing to do with the winter wind. Someone, or something, was coming down.

**Setting:**

The Hotel Bellweather is a grand, old hotel located in the heart of London, a stone's throw from Buckingham Palace. It's a landmark, its architecture a blend of Victorian and Edwardian styles, radiating an aura of faded elegance and old-world charm. Imagine high ceilings, intricate moldings, and a sweeping marble staircase. The lobby is furnished with antique sofas and armchairs upholstered in rich fabrics, scattered around Persian rugs that have absorbed the footsteps of countless celebrities and dignitaries. Crystal chandeliers cast a warm, flickering light, and oil paintings of long-forgotten aristocrats gaze down from the walls. The Bellweather is known for its impeccable service and discreet atmosphere, a place where secrets are kept and desires are catered to with unwavering professionalism. But lately, a distinct air of neglect has begun to creep into the hotel, a subtle decay that even Barnaby's keen eye cannot ignore.
