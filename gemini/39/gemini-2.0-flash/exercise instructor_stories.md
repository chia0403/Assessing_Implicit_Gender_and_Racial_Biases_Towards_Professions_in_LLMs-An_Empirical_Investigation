Okay, here's a story opening with the requested elements:

**Story Opening:**

The pre-dawn chill seeped through the cracks in the studio's old windows, raising goosebumps on Roxanne "Rocky" McMillan's arms.  Outside, the city was still hushed, a grey and slumbering giant, but inside Body Boost, Roxanne was already a whirlwind of controlled energy.  She surveyed the room â€“ a large, brightly lit space with mirrors lining one wall, a selection of dumbbells neatly arranged on a rack, and the scent of lemon-scented cleaner hanging in the air. The hardwood floor, well-worn from years of jumping jacks and burpees, gleamed under the fluorescent lights.

She cranked up the music, a thumping remix of Dua Lipa's "Don't Start Now," the bass vibrating through her chest. A nervous energy always buzzed in her before her sunrise "Body Blitz" class.  Would they show up? Would they push themselves? Would they curse her name halfway through the ab circuit? She hoped for all three, in varying degrees. Because Roxanne McMillan, certified fitness guru and queen of the perfectly-timed push-up, believed in the power of sweat, the camaraderie of shared pain, and the transformative magic of a really good workout.  And today, she was ready to deliver. The lights flickered, casting her shadow, long and lean, onto the empty dance floor.  Time to get this show on the road.
