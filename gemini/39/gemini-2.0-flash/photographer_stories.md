## Story Opening:

The humid Savannah air hung thick and heavy, clinging to Amelia Hayes like a damp shroud. She adjusted the worn leather strap of her camera bag, its weight a familiar comfort against her hip. The scent of jasmine and decaying plumeria blossoms, a cloying mix of beauty and rot, filled the air. Amelia lifted her gaze, squinting against the late afternoon sun that filtered through the Spanish moss draped over the ancient oaks.

A shiver crawled up her spine, a prickle of unease that had nothing to do with the sweat trickling down her back. It was the house, looming before her like a silent, stone-faced judge. Ashton Hall. A notorious plantation house, steeped in whispers and legend, its grandeur now faded and crumbling.

She hadn't believed the rumors, of course. Not really. Ghost stories were for tourists, not for a photographer seeking to capture the enduring beauty of the South. But even through the lens of objectivity, Amelia Hayes couldn't shake the feeling that she was being watched. That the past, buried beneath layers of paint and ivy, was reaching out, desperate to be seen.
