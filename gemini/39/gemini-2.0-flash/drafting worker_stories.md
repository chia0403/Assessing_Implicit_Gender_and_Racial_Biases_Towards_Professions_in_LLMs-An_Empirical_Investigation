## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights of the office hummed a monotonous song, a song Elias Thorne knew by heart. Each buzz and flicker was a metronome marking the passage of another minute closer to five o'clock. Elias adjusted the worn, leather-bound armrest of his drafting chair, a futile attempt to alleviate the ache that had settled deep in his left shoulder. He squinted at the blueprint spread before him, the labyrinthine network of pipes and valves swimming slightly under the harsh glare. He'd been staring at this section of the new ventilation system for the better part of three hours, trying to resolve a discrepancy between the architect's vision and the practical realities of space constraints.

Elias ran a calloused finger over the crisp lines of the tracing paper. He was a perfectionist, bordering on obsessive. He couldn't let a single misplaced line, a single miscalculated angle, slip past his scrutiny. His father, a master carpenter, had instilled that in him: measure twice, cut once. The same principle applied to drafting, though instead of wood and nails, it was lines and numbers that defined the boundaries of success and failure. Today, however, success felt impossibly far away.

He sighed, the sound barely audible above the clatter of keyboards and the murmur of conversations around him. Another hour. Another hour to wrestle with this recalcitrant design, another hour to battle the encroaching fatigue that threatened to smudge his vision and his judgment. He glanced at the framed photograph on his desk: his wife, Clara, her smile radiant and hopeful, standing beside their tiny vegetable garden. He had promised her heâ€™d be home early tonight. Freshly dug potatoes for supper, she'd said. But promises were easy to make in the morning, under the soft glow of dawn. Promises were harder to keep when buried under blueprints and deadlines.

## Setting:

The story is set in the bustling, yet undeniably drab, offices of **Henson & Croft Engineering**, located in a mid-sized city somewhere in the American Midwest in the late 1970s. The office space is a large, open plan affair dominated by rows of drafting tables, each occupied by a drafting worker hunched over their work. The walls are painted a utilitarian beige, punctuated by corkboards plastered with project schedules, memos, and the occasional dog-eared pin-up calendar. Natural light is minimal, with most illumination coming from the ubiquitous fluorescent fixtures that cast a harsh, clinical light. The air is thick with the smell of ammonia from the blueprint machine, stale coffee, and the faint scent of pipe tobacco emanating from Mr. Croft's private office at the far end of the room. The overall atmosphere is one of quiet diligence, punctuated by the rhythmic scratching of pencils on paper, the occasional shouted question, and the constant hum of the machinery that keeps the operation running.
