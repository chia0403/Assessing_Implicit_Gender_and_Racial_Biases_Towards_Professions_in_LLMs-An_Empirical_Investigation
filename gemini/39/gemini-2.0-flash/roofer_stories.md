## Story Opening & Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The sunrise was a bloody gash across the horizon, mirroring the ache in Arthur Bartholomew Phillips' lower back. He swore his vertebrae were slowly fusing together, cemented by years of hauling shingles and squinting against the blinding glare off asphalt. Another day, another roof. He spat a stream of tobacco juice that landed a satisfying centimeter from a particularly brazen pigeon perched on the edge of the neighboring building. "Git outta here, ya feathered freeloader," Arthur muttered, the sound lost in the pre-dawn hum of the city waking up. He hoisted his toolbox, the weight familiar and yet, today, almost unbearable, and started the long, slow climb up the rickety ladder, each rung groaning under his bulk like an old man complaining about his aches and pains. He just hoped this roof didn't decide to collapse on him before he even got a hammer in his hand.

**Setting:**

The story is set in **the faded glory of South Philadelphia, specifically the Point Breeze neighborhood.** Imagine a landscape of narrow, brick row houses crammed together like teeth in a poorly aligned jaw. Some are freshly painted, bright bursts of color amidst the grime, while others are peeling and crumbling, whispering stories of neglect and hardship. Overhead, a tangled web of electrical wires crisscrosses the sky, occasionally punctuated by the screech of the El train rumbling past.

The air is thick with the smells of cheesesteaks frying, exhaust fumes, and the ever-present salty tang of the Schuylkill River not too far away. It's a working-class neighborhood, a place where generations have lived and died, their lives etched into the brick and mortar of the houses themselves. The streets are a patchwork of cracked pavement and uneven sidewalks, worn smooth by countless footsteps. Small corner stores overflow with produce and lottery tickets, their awnings faded and flapping in the breeze. Itâ€™s a place of resilience, a place where people look out for each other, but also a place where secrets fester beneath the surface, hidden behind closed doors and boarded-up windows.
