## Story Opening:

The antiseptic smell clung to Evelyn Grace Bellweather like a second skin, a permanent reminder of her life spent within the sterile confines of St. Jude's Hospital. Outside, Chicago was blooming, a riot of vibrant greens and burgeoning optimism. But inside, in the hushed pre-dawn hours of the Blood Draw Clinic, Evelyn felt the familiar tug of apprehension. Today was the day. The day her life took an unexpected, potentially terrifying, turn.

She checked the schedule one last time, her finger tracing down the list of names. Mostly routine stuff: pre-op blood work, cholesterol panels, a few urgent CBCs for the Emergency Room. But there, nestled between Mr. Harold Peterson and Ms. Sylvia Chen, was the name that had been churning in her stomach for days: Mr. Alistair Thorne.

Alistair Thorne.

The name alone conjured images of shadowed corners and whispers in the dark. Evelyn had heard the stories, of course. Everyone at St. Jude's had. He was a recluse, they said, a millionaire philanthropist with a mysterious illness that kept him perpetually cloistered in his penthouse suite. No visitors, no contact. Only the hospital's most trusted staff, those who swore an oath of absolute discretion, were permitted access. And now, thanks to a scheduling error that was likely going to cost someone their job, Evelyn Grace Bellweather, a humble phlebotomist with a penchant for herbal tea and true crime podcasts, was about to enter Alistair Thorne's world.

## Setting:

The primary setting is **St. Jude's Hospital, Chicago**, specifically:

*   **The Blood Draw Clinic:** A brightly lit, functional space on the ground floor of the hospital. White walls, rows of comfortable phlebotomy chairs upholstered in durable vinyl, and antiseptic dispensers on every surface. It's usually bustling with patients during the day, but eerily quiet and still in the pre-dawn hours.

*   **Alistair Thorne's Penthouse Suite:** Located on the top floor of a connected medical tower, this is a stark contrast to the sterile atmosphere of the hospital. Described as luxurious and gothic, with dark wood paneling, heavy velvet curtains, and antique furniture. The lighting is dim and atmospheric, creating an almost oppressive sense of secrecy. It feels more like a Victorian study than a modern living space. The air is thick with the scent of old books and something elseâ€¦ something subtly metallic and unsettling.
