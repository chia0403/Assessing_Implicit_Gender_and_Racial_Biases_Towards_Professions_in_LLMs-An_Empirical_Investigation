Okay, here's a story opening, including setting and full name of the main character, a florist:

**Opening:**

The scent of bruised lilies hung heavy in the air, a cloying sweetness that did little to lift Anastasia Rosewood's spirits. Outside, a November drizzle was painting the cobblestones of Lily Lane a dismal, slick grey. Inside "Petals & Prose," Anastasiaâ€™s tiny flower shop, the artificial warmth of the radiators battled a losing war against the pervasive chill seeping in from the ancient, ill-fitting window frames. She stared glumly at the wilting hydrangeas in the chipped porcelain vase, their once vibrant blue now tinged with a depressing purple. Another sign of the season, she supposed. Another sign of the slow, inevitable decay that seemed to mirror her own life these days. It had been three weeks since Mr. Henderson, her most loyal (and let's face it, richest) customer, had passed. Three weeks since she'd designed his breathtaking funeral bouquet, a masterpiece of white orchids and stargazer lilies. Three weeks since the shop had been, well, almost silent. She sighed, the sound lost in the hiss of the steam, and tugged her worn woolen cardigan tighter around her. Maybe she should just close up shop early and drown her sorrows in a cup of Earl Grey. But the thought of the untouched invoices piled on her desk spurred her to action. She needed to sell something, anything, or "Petals & Prose" wouldn't see another spring.

**Setting:**

The story is set in a small, fictional town called "Hollow Creek," nestled in the rolling hills of upstate New York. Hollow Creek is the kind of town where everyone knows everyone, where the annual apple festival is the highlight of the social calendar, and where change comes slowly, if at all. The shop, "Petals & Prose," is located on Lily Lane, the town's quaint main street. It's a charming but slightly run-down building, with peeling paint on its storefront and overflowing window boxes filled with seasonal flowers (currently, rather sad-looking chrysanthemums). Inside, the shop is a riot of colors and textures, with buckets of fresh flowers, potted plants, vintage vases, and antique books crammed into every available space. The overall atmosphere is one of cozy, slightly cluttered charm, hinting at a history and a soul.

**Main Character:**
