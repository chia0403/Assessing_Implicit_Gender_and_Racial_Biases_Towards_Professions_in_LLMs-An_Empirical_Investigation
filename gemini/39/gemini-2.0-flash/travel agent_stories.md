## Story Opening:

The scent of stale coffee and impending panic hung thick in the air of "Getaway Guru" Travel Agency. Eleanor Penelope Davies, normally a beacon of calm amidst the chaos of honeymoon planning and visa applications, felt a bead of sweat trickle down her temple. Her fingers danced a frantic jig over the keyboard, her eyes darting between three open browser windows: "Latest Flight Delays - Heathrow," "Emergency Hotel Bookings - Tenerife," and "How to Talk Down an Angry Bride."

It was July, peak season, and the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajökull – proving it hadn't learned its lesson from 2010 – had decided to burp out another plume of ash, throwing transatlantic travel into utter disarray. Eleanor, known for her meticulous itineraries and soothing demeanor, was teetering on the brink of a full-blown professional meltdown.

She gripped her lukewarm coffee, the ceramic mug adorned with a picture of the Eiffel Tower, its cheerful facade mocking her current reality. Mrs. Higgins's honeymoon to the Maldives was on the line, Mr. Peterson's vital business trip to New York was hanging in the balance, and Eleanor was pretty sure that the only "Getaway" anyone was having right now was *away* from her agency.

## Setting:

"Getaway Guru" was nestled on a bustling side street in the charming coastal town of Port Blossom, Cornwall. The building itself was a quaint two-story affair, its exterior painted a cheerful, if slightly faded, turquoise. Window boxes overflowing with geraniums spilled vibrant color onto the pavement. Inside, the walls were plastered with travel posters, each a postcard-perfect representation of exotic locales: the turquoise waters of Bora Bora, the snow-capped peaks of the Himalayas, the bustling markets of Marrakech.

Despite the idyllic imagery, the interior was a testament to controlled chaos. Piles of brochures teetered precariously on desks, maps were unfurled and half-pinned to corkboards, and the faint aroma of sunscreen mingled with the aforementioned stale coffee. Eleanor's desk, normally an oasis of organization, was currently buried under a mountain of flight confirmations, hotel vouchers, and half-eaten digestive biscuits. The air buzzed with the constant hum of the printer, spitting out revised itineraries and desperate pleas for mercy from frustrated travelers. It was, in essence, a perfectly accurate reflection of the travel industry: beautiful destinations, meticulously planned adventures, and the ever-present threat of utter, unmitigated disaster.
