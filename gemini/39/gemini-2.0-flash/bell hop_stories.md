## Story Opening:

The chipped enamel on the bellhop's cart gleamed faintly under the dim, pre-dawn light filtering through the grand hotel's revolving doors. Dust motes danced in the shafts of light, a microscopic ballet that mirrored the chaotic thoughts swirling in Archibald Bartholomew Blackwood's head. He adjusted his too-tight collar, the starched fabric scratching at his already-irritated skin, and took a deep breath, the scent of old money and lemon polish filling his lungs. Today was the day. Today, he was going to ask her. He ran a nervous hand over the meticulously polished buttons of his uniform, the brass cool and smooth against his clammy palm. He'd rehearsed the lines a hundred times, yet doubt still gnawed at the edges of his confidence.

He knew it was a fool's errand. A bellhop asking out a singer, especially *this* singer, was like a robin flirting with a hawk. But the memory of her smile, the echo of her laughter bouncing through the ornate lobby, fueled a flicker of defiant hope in his chest. He just needed to find the right moment. And maybe, just maybe, she'd see him. Not as Archibald Bartholomew Blackwood, the lowly bellhop, but as someoneâ€¦ else.
## Setting:

**The Grand Astoria Hotel, New York City, 1938.**

The Grand Astoria stood as a gilded monument to extravagance on Fifth Avenue. Built during the roaring twenties, it had weathered the Depression with an almost defiant opulence, a haven for the city's elite, visiting dignitaries, and the occasional Hollywood starlet. The lobby was a symphony of marble, polished brass, and plush velvet, its soaring ceilings adorned with intricate murals depicting scenes of classical mythology. Crystal chandeliers, the size of small cars, cast a shimmering light across the bustling scene, reflecting off the mirrored columns and highlighting the impeccably dressed patrons. The air hummed with the hushed conversations, the clinking of cocktail glasses, and the faint strains of jazz music emanating from the hotel's renowned Blue Moon Lounge. From the bell desk, Archibald could see the constant flow of humanity: elegantly dressed ladies with their furs and jewels, sharply tailored gentlemen with their cigars and anxieties, and a perpetual stream of bellhops, hustling and bustling to cater to their every whim. The Grand Astoria was a world unto itself, a microcosm of society's highest echelons, and Archibald, for all his proximity to its grandeur, was only ever a footnote.
