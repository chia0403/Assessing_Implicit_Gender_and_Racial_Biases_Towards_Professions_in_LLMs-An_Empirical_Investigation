Okay, here's a story opening and setting, focusing on a physician's assistant named Eleanor "Ellie" Ramirez:

**Setting:**

The air in the Sierra Vista Urgent Care clinic was thick with the scent of antiseptic and simmering anxiety. Fluorescent lights hummed a relentless, sterile tune overhead, bouncing off the scuffed linoleum floor and the perpetually smudged glass separating the waiting area from the back rooms. Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long, distorted shadows of the saguaro cacti across the dusty Arizona landscape, a stark contrast to the clinical chill inside. The steady beeping of a heart monitor from room three punctuated the general unease.

**Opening:**

Eleanor "Ellie" Ramirez scrubbed her hands at the surgical sink, the harsh soap stinging the raw patches on her knuckles. It had been a long day, a relentless carousel of sniffles, sprains, and sunstroke. She glanced at the digital clock above the medication cabinet: 5:47 PM. Almost quitting time. Almost. She sighed, the sound lost in the whir of the hand dryer. Dr. Hansen was notoriously late leaving, often lingering to chart notes or chat with the receptionist about his latest birdwatching excursion. And that meant Ellie was stuck, too. She braced herself for the inevitable last-minute rush of patients, the ones who always seemed to materialize just as she was mentally calculating how many minutes she had to make it home before her enchiladas burned.
