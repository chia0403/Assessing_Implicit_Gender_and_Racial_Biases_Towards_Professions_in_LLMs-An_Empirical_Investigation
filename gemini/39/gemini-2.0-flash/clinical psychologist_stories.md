## Story Opening:

The air in the waiting room hung thick with the scent of nervous anticipation and cheap lavender potpourri. Dr. Eleanor Vance, clinical psychologist, hated that potpourri. She'd replaced it three times already, each time opting for something less aggressively floral, but her receptionist, Mildred, always reverted back to the same dusty, purple sac. Eleanor suspected it was Mildred's passive-aggressive way of reminding her who truly ran the ship.

Eleanor straightened her navy blazer, a subconscious gesture meant to project an image of calm and competence she often felt lacking these days. The muffled sobs coming from behind her office door did little to bolster her confidence. This was her last patient of the day, a Mr. Henderson, who, based on the sounds alone, seemed to be unraveling at a spectacular rate.

She took a deep breath, the lavender almost choking her. It was time to face the music, and perhaps, more importantly, to gently guide Mr. Henderson back to a semblance of harmony. Lord knew, she could use a little harmony in her own life too. She glanced at the framed diploma on the wall, a reminder of years of grueling study and countless hours spent listening to the woes of others. It felt a lifetime ago, back when she still believed she could fix everything.

## Setting:

**Eleanor's Private Practice:**

Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, “Vance Psychological Services,” is located in a renovated Victorian house on a quiet, tree-lined street in the affluent suburb of Oakwood Falls. The house, painted a soothing pale yellow with crisp white trim, is aesthetically pleasing but starting to show its age.

The waiting room, though quaint with its antique furniture and calming watercolors, feels slightly cramped. The aforementioned lavender potpourri sits in a ceramic bowl on the coffee table, next to a stack of outdated magazines. A small, ornate grandfather clock ticks relentlessly in the corner, adding to the atmosphere of subdued anxiety.

Eleanor's office itself is a more personal space. Bookshelves overflowing with psychology texts line one wall, while the opposite wall holds diplomas and framed certificates. A comfortable, overstuffed armchair and a matching sofa face each other, creating a conversational setting. A large window overlooks the backyard, where a neglected rose garden struggles to bloom. The overall impression is one of faded elegance and well-intentioned but ultimately unsuccessful attempts at creating a truly tranquil environment. It's a space that reflects Eleanor herself – competent and capable, but carrying the weight of years spent absorbing the burdens of others.
