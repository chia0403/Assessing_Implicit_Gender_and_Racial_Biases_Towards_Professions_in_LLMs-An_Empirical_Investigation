## Story Opening & Setting:

The smell of sawdust and blood, a familiar and comforting aroma to Bartholomew "Barty" Higgins, hung thick in the air of Higgins & Sons Fine Meats. It was the smell of honest work, of tradition, and of the generations of Higgins men who had wielded cleavers within these very walls. The setting sun, a molten orange smear against the grimy windowpanes, cast long, distorted shadows across the shop floor, highlighting the gleaming, stainless steel counter and the sawdust-covered floor. 

Barty, his apron stained a mosaic of crimson hues, expertly separated a side of beef into manageable cuts. He knew each muscle, each sinew, each bone like the back of his own hand. He could tell the age of the beast by the grain of the meat, the quality of its life by the marbling of the fat. He was a master of his craft, a butcher in the truest sense of the word, and this small, unassuming shop, nestled on the edge of Havenwood's bustling marketplace, was his kingdom. But tonight, the familiar rhythm of his work, the satisfying thud of the cleaver against the cutting board, couldn't quite drown out the nagging unease that had been gnawing at him all day.
