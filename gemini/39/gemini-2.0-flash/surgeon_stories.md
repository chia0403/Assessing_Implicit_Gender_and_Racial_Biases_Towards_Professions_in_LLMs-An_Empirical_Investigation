## Story Opening and Setting

**Setting:** The pre-dawn stillness hung heavy over the sprawling campus of the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics in Iowa City. A thin layer of frost clung to the bare branches of the oak trees flanking the entrance, their skeletal fingers reaching towards the pale, indifferent sky. Inside, fluorescent lights hummed a tireless, unwavering song, a stark contrast to the quiet outside. The air, recycled and sterile, carried the faint scent of antiseptic and anxiety.

**Opening:** Dr. Eleanor Vivian Ainsworth gripped the lukewarm coffee cup, its cardboard already softening in her hand. The seventh floor of the John Colloton Pavilion, home to the cardiothoracic surgery unit, was eerily silent save for the rhythmic beeping of monitors down the hall. She stared out the window, her reflection a ghostly overlay on the frosted landscape. In less than an hour, she'd be facing the most challenging surgery of her career: a Ross Procedure on a patient whose aortic valve was failing faster than anyone had predicted. Eleanor wasn't nervous, not exactly. She was, however, acutely aware of the weight of responsibility settled on her shoulders, a weight that felt heavier than the combined pressure of the Iowa winter and the expectations of her colleagues. Taking a deep breath, she tossed the coffee into the overflowing bin and turned away from the window, a glint of steel in her clear blue eyes. It was time.
