## Story Opening:

The scent of stale coffee and teen angst hung heavy in the air of Ms. Evelyn Grace Harding's office. She hadn't even taken a sip of her lukewarm brew yet, choosing instead to arrange the miniature zen garden on her desk, meticulously raking the sand into neat, symmetrical lines. It was a futile attempt to impose order onto the chaos that was her life, and more immediately, the lives of the students at Northwood High. 

A rhythmic, insistent knocking echoed through the thick oak door, disrupting her brief moment of serenity. "Come in," she sighed, already bracing herself. It was probably another distraught sophomore convinced they were going to fail algebra, or worse, a parent demanding to know why their precious angel wasn't being placed on the Varsity Debate team.

## Setting:

Evelyn's office was a carefully curated haven, attempting to blend the sterile functionality of a school office with a touch of comforting homeliness. The walls were painted a calming sage green, punctuated by framed posters featuring inspirational quotes like, "The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams" (a sentiment Evelyn was starting to find increasingly trite). Bookshelves overflowed with college guides, career aptitude tests, and pamphlets on everything from stress management to dealing with peer pressure. A worn, comfortable armchair sat opposite her desk, a silent invitation to pour out anxieties and fears. Sunlight, filtered through slightly dusty blinds, cast stripes across the worn Persian rug beneath her feet, adding a touch of warmth to the otherwise clinical space. Outside, the sounds of a typical high school day - the shrill bleat of the dismissal bell, the echoing laughter of students, and the distant thump of basketballs - served as a constant reminder of the pressures and dramas that played out beyond her sanctuary.
