## Story Opening:

The salt air bit at Detective Isabella “Izzy” Rossi’s cheeks as she leaned against the weathered railing, the rhythmic creak of the fishing boats a low hum beneath the screech of gulls. The sky, a bruised purple bleeding into the first tentative streaks of dawn, mirrored the knot in her stomach. Another body. Another cold, lifeless stare reflected in the murky water of Mariner’s Cove. This wasn’t how she pictured her Friday morning starting. She took a long drag from her cigarette, the nicotine doing little to calm the tremor in her hand. This was the third one this month, all young women, all found in similar conditions. And all, she suspected, tied together by a thread she was desperately trying to unravel.

## Setting:

The story is set in **Port Blossom, Maine**, a small, picturesque fishing town clinging to the jagged coastline. Generations of families have made their living from the sea, their lives dictated by the tides and the whims of the ocean. The town is a patchwork of brightly colored clapboard houses, salty docks lined with trawlers and lobster boats, and weathered brick buildings that house antique shops, seafood restaurants, and the local pub, "The Salty Siren." Tourism thrives during the summer months, filling the streets with visitors eager to experience the "authentic" New England charm. However, beneath the postcard facade lies a close-knit community with deep-seated secrets, where whispers travel faster than the coastal wind and outsiders are often viewed with suspicion. Mariner’s Cove, a small, secluded inlet on the edge of town, is a favorite spot for local fishermen and a tragically recurring location for grim discoveries.
