## The Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:**

The fluorescent lights of the Northwood Counseling Center hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to anxieties unseen and stories unheard. The Center, a squat brick building nestled on the edge of the bustling Northwood University campus, housed a collection of therapists, interns, and a rotating cast of students grappling with everything from exam stress to existential dread. Its waiting room, perpetually smelling of stale coffee and muted desperation, was sparsely furnished with mismatched chairs and a worn-out copy of "National Geographic." The walls were painted a calming, yet ultimately ineffective, shade of beige.

**Opening:**

Dr. Evelyn "Eve" Amelia Harding stared at the blinking cursor on her computer screen, the faint rhythmic pulse a stark contrast to the whirlwind of thoughts in her head. It was 9:57 AM, and in three minutes, her first patient of the day, a jittery freshman named Ethan, would be shuffling through her door. Ethan, who was convinced his roommate was plotting against him with subliminal messages hidden in his Spotify playlists. Eve sighed, massaging the bridge of her nose. She loved her job, truly, but some days felt like navigating a minefield of anxieties, one awkward sentence at a time. The scent of the lavender oil she’d diffused that morning barely registered, overwhelmed by the lingering aroma of last night’s leftover pizza. Another day in paradise, she thought wryly, clicking her mouse to finally open Ethan's file. He'd updated his intake form with a list of "suspicious" song titles. This was going to be interesting.
