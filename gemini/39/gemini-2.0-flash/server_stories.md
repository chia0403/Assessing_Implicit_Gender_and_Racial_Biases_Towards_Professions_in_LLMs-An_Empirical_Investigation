Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a server named:

**Story Opening:**

The clatter of silverware against porcelain, usually a symphony to Amelia "Millie" Rosewood's ears, grated like nails on a chalkboard. It wasn't the sound itself, but what it signified: another rush, another table demanding her attention, another stack of orders threatening to bury her alive. She wiped a stray strand of auburn hair from her damp forehead, a futile gesture in the humid coastal air that clung to everything like a persistent lover.  Her feet throbbed, a dull, persistent ache that started just below her arches and radiated up her calves. She could feel the phantom imprint of the paper napkins she'd been folding earlier, a grid pattern pressed into her skin. Tonight felt different. Tonight, the usual low-level hum of anxiety that accompanied a Friday night at The Salty Siren was replaced with a prickling unease, a feeling that something was about to go very wrong.

**Setting:**

The Salty Siren, a seafood restaurant perched precariously on a weathered pier jutting out into the Pacific Ocean just north of Monterey, California. The pier itself was a patchwork of sun-bleached planks and salt-corroded metal, creaking and groaning with every wave that crashed beneath it.  Inside, the restaurant attempted a rustic-chic vibe, with nautical ropes strung haphazardly across exposed beams, salvaged driftwood serving as decorative accents, and mismatched mason jars used as water glasses. The smell of grilled fish, fried calamari, and briny sea air hung heavy in the air, a potent combination that both attracted and repelled in equal measure. Large windows offered panoramic views of the ocean, usually a selling point, but tonight the churning grey waves and darkening sky added to the sense of impending doom. The lighting was dim, designed to be romantic, but instead it cast long, dancing shadows that played tricks on the eyes.

**Main Character:**

Amelia "Millie" Rosewood.
