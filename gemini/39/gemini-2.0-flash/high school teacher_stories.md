Each falling leaf felt like another piece of his youthful idealism, slowly decaying and scattering across the asphalt. This year felt different. The apathy amongst his students seemed thicker, the pressures they faced more intense. He longed for the days when the greatest challenge was memorizing the dates of the French Revolution. Now, it felt like he was trying to teach history to a generation already grappling with their own impending apocalypse.
