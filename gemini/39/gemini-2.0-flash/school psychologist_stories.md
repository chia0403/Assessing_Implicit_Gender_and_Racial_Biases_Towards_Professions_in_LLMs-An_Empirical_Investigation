## Story Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

Dr. Eleanor Vance felt the tremor in her hands before she even reached for the lukewarm coffee. It wasn’t the caffeine withdrawal, though she was sorely tempted to blame it on that. No, this particular tremor was born of a gnawing anxiety that had taken root deep in her gut, a seed planted by Mrs. Davies’ panicked voicemail the day before. “It’s Peter, Dr. Vance,” the principal's voice had crackled through her phone, "I think...I think something is really wrong." Eleanor knew that “really wrong” at Northwood Elementary often translated to late nights, difficult parents, and the crushing weight of a child’s untold pain. She sighed, the stale air of the staff lounge clinging to her like a shroud. Today was going to be one of those days.

**Setting:**

The setting is Northwood Elementary School, a sprawling, single-story brick building nestled in the quiet, affluent suburb of Oakhaven, Connecticut. It’s early October, the trees ablaze with the vibrant colors of fall. The crisp air carries the scent of decaying leaves and the distant murmur of lawnmowers. Inside, Northwood is a typical elementary school, albeit a slightly more upscale version. The walls are adorned with brightly colored student artwork, the hallways echoing with the cheerful (though sometimes chaotic) sounds of children. Dr. Vance's office, however, is a sanctuary of calm, a small, cluttered space filled with children's books, colorful toys, and an assortment of stress balls. A framed print of Van Gogh’s “Starry Night” hangs on the wall, a constant reminder that even in the darkest moments, beauty and wonder can still be found. The window overlooks the playground, currently deserted before the morning bell, but soon to be a vibrant hub of youthful energy, anxieties, and everything in between.
