The sickly sweet smell of hairspray hung heavy in the air, a potent blend of artificial cherry and burnt sugar. Outside, a relentless February drizzle blurred the neon glow of "Shear Elegance" into a shimmering halo, reflecting on the slick, empty streets of Havenwood, Ohio. Inside, the salon buzzed with a different kind of static, a low hum of nervous energy emanating from the only person present.

Vivienne Amelia Bellweather, her name a florid contradiction to her practical, no-nonsense nature, adjusted the collar of her black smock, the fabric crackling softly. She checked her reflection in the oversized mirror, her tired eyes staring back from a face that was more functional than fashionable. Her auburn hair, usually sculpted into a neat French twist, was today pulled back in a messy bun, betraying her anxiety. Vivienne wasn't worried about the lack of customers; Havenwood was a town that only truly cared about their hair before church on Sundays or weddings. No, her unease stemmed from the cryptic message scrawled on a napkin left on her doorstep this morning: "The raven knows. Tuesday. Don't cut."
