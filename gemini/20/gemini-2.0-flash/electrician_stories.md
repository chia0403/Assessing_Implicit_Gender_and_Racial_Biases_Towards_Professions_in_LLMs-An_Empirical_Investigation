The biting wind howled through the skeletal remains of the old steel mill, each gust whistling a mournful tune through rusted pipes and shattered windows. Rain lashed against the corrugated iron walls, turning the concrete floor into a slick, treacherous surface. Inside the cavernous space, a single work light cast a feeble, yellowish glow, barely pushing back the oppressive gloom. This was Blackwood Steel, abandoned to the ravages of time and vandals, a monument to a bygone era of industry and a testament to economic decline.

The air hung heavy with the metallic tang of decay and the earthy smell of dampness. Ellie shivered, pulling her worn Carhartt jacket tighter around her. She swore under her breath as another drop of water trickled down the back of her neck. This wasn't just any job; this was a favor, a shot in the dark, and quite possibly a descent into madness.

He claimed the new owners of Blackwood Steel – a shadowy development company with more money than sense – wanted to see if the ancient power grid could be brought back to life. Ellie suspected it was a fool's errand, but here she was, facing a electrical graveyard, armed with her trusty multimeter, a roll of electrical tape, and a hefty dose of skepticism.
