**Story Opening:**

The bell above the door to "Arthur Finch & Son, Finest Meats" jingled, a sound Arthur Finch had heard thousands, if not millions, of times in his fifty-seven years. But today, it felt different. It wasn't the cheerful chime it usually was, more a discordant clang that echoed the uneasy feeling twisting in his gut. Arthur glanced up from meticulously trimming a rack of lamb, his weathered hands pausing mid-slice. Sunlight, unusually bright for a late November morning, streamed through the glass, highlighting the dust motes dancing in the air and casting long shadows across the gleaming, bone-white tiles. He wiped his hands on his stained apron, his brow furrowed. Usually, Mrs. Higgins was here by now, ready for her weekly order of beef marrow bones for her prize-winning terrier, Winston. Maybe she was late. Maybe...maybe something else entirely.

**Setting:**

The setting is the small, unassuming town of Havenwood, nestled in the rolling hills of Yorkshire, England. "Arthur Finch & Son, Finest Meats" occupies a prime spot on the town's main street, sandwiched between Mrs. Gable's haberdashery and the slightly dilapidated Havenwood Gazette office. The butcher shop itself is an institution, a place where generations of Havenwood families have come for their Sunday roasts and sausages for breakfast.

Inside, the shop is a testament to both tradition and Arthur's meticulous nature. The walls are a clean, if slightly faded, white, adorned with framed certificates of excellence dating back to Arthur's father's tenure. A large, antique scale sits proudly on the counter, its brass gleaming despite its age. The refrigerated display case, overflowing with cuts of beef, pork, lamb, and poultry, is meticulously arranged, each piece labeled with neat, hand-written signs. The air is thick with the savory aroma of smoked meats and freshly ground spices, a smell that is both comforting and intensely appetizing. In the back, a heavy oak door leads to the butchery where Arthur spends most of his time, surrounded by cleavers, saws, and the raw materials of his trade.
