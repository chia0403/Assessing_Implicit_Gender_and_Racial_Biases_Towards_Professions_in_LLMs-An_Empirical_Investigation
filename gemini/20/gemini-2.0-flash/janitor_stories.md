Okay, here's a story opening with the setting and the full name of the main character, a janitor:

**Story Opening:**

The fluorescent lights of the Guggenheim hummed a monotonous tune, echoing off the spiraling ramp that was, even empty, still a work of art. For Edgar Alistair Finch, however, it was just another gradient of filth. He gripped the handle of his mop bucket a little tighter, the cold plastic a familiar comfort against his calloused palm. Tonight was particularly bad. Some over-enthusiastic gala-goer had decided Jackson Pollock was a "good" target for projectile vomit, and the custodial staff was paying the price. Edgar sighed, the sound lost in the cavernous space. He was too old for this. Too old to be scrubbing abstract expressionism at three in the morning, haunted by the ghosts of wealthy patrons and the lingering scent of cheap champagne. He dipped his mop in the soapy water, a silent prayer for strength on his lips. He had until dawn to make the Guggenheim gleam, and Edgar Alistair Finch had never failed a task in his life.

**Setting:**

The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York City. It is late at night, around 3:00 AM. The museum is empty of visitors, save for the custodial staff working the night shift. The iconic spiral ramp is the main focus of this opening scene, showcasing both its architectural beauty and the immediate task at hand for Edgar: cleaning. The atmosphere is quiet and somewhat eerie, emphasized by the hum of the lights and the sense of being alone in a vast, art-filled space.
