## Story Opening:

The scent of lavender and desperation hung thick in the air of the Grand Ballroom. Mildred Abigail Plumtree, housekeeper extraordinaire and veteran of countless social calamities, surveyed the wreckage. Confetti, like a miniature blizzard, dusted the parquet floor. Half-eaten canap√©s clung precariously to the edges of tables, their tiny flags wilting in the post-celebratory gloom. And at the centre of it all, slumped over a marble-topped bar like a wilting bloom, was Mrs. Van Derlyn, the mistress of the house, nursing a glass of something amber and potent. Mildred sighed. Another gala, another mess, another morning of meticulous restoration. She pulled on her rubber gloves, the familiar snap a small act of defiance against the chaos, and prepared to wage war against the detritus of high society.
## Setting:

**The Van Derlyn Estate, "Oakhaven," nestled in the Hudson Valley, New York, 1928.**

Oakhaven wasn't merely a house; it was a sprawling testament to old money and ostentatious taste. Built in the Gilded Age, it boasted thirty bedrooms, a private bowling alley, a formal rose garden, and a staff dedicated to maintaining its facade of effortless perfection. The interior was a dizzying display of imported marble, hand-painted wallpaper, and priceless antiques. The grandeur was undeniable, but Mildred, who had seen it all stripped bare by the harsh light of dawn, knew the cracks beneath the veneer. She knew the damp patches in the library, the loose floorboards in the west wing, and the quiet sadness that permeated the rooms despite the constant flurry of activity. While the Van Derlyn family lived within a gilded cage of privilege, Mildred lived in the shadows, privy to their secrets and tasked with preserving their illusions.
