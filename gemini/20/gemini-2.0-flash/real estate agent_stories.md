Okay, here’s a story opening and setting, focusing on a real estate agent:

**Opening and Setting:**

The relentless Florida sun beat down on the shimmering hood of Isabella Rodriguez’s pearl-white Cadillac Escalade. Sweat beaded on her forehead despite the blasting AC as she navigated the maze of manicured lawns and pastel-colored homes that characterized the exclusive gated community of "Azure Palms." Isabella, a woman who believed in projecting success, even when knee-deep in swampy financing deals, adjusted her designer sunglasses and tightened her grip on the leather steering wheel. The humidity hung heavy in the air, a thick, invisible blanket that threatened to smother the perfectly coiffed hairstyles of the Azure Palms residents.

Isabella had a bad feeling. She’d felt it this morning, a subtle prickle of unease as she sipped her Cuban coffee. The air in Miami was always thick with the possibility of scams and shady dealings, but this was different. This was more personal.

She pulled up to 12 Seabreeze Lane, a sprawling Mediterranean-style villa overlooking the turquoise waters of Biscayne Bay. The property, valued at $7.5 million, had been Isabella's biggest listing this quarter. *Had been,* that is, until the seller, a reclusive tech mogul named Damien Blackwood, decided to pull it off the market… without explanation… or commission. Isabella, a woman not easily deterred, wasn’t about to let that happen. She'd spent weeks cultivating this relationship, schmoozing Mr. Blackwood, and visualizing that fat commission check lining her bank account.

Something was off about the house. It looked… deserted. The fountain in the courtyard wasn’t running, the vibrant bougainvillea seemed to droop, and the normally meticulous landscaping looked slightly overgrown. It was like a scene from a ghost movie, only this one cost 7.5 million. Isabella Rodriguez, even with her years in the Miami real estate game, felt a shiver run down her spine. This was going to be interesting.
