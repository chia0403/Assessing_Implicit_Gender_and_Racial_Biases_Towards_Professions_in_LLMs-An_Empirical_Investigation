**Opening:**

The stench hit Thomas Abernathy like a wall, a humid, putrid wave that made his eyes water and his stomach churn. He recognized it, of course. Years in the plumbing trade had made him intimately familiar with the bouquet of rotting food, stagnant water, and something indefinably… *off* that clung to the back alleys and basement sumps of New Orleans. He just hadn’t expected to find it emanating from a pristine, white, Victorian mansion overlooking Audubon Park.

**Setting:**

The address, 63 Audubon Place, was impeccable. The house itself, a three-story behemoth painted a blinding white, radiated old money and an almost aggressive sense of respectability. Wrought iron balconies dripped with overflowing flower boxes, bursting with vibrantly colored petunias and geraniums. A meticulously manicured lawn stretched towards the park, broken only by a circular drive leading to the massive front doors, currently obscured by a team of uniformed landscapers.

Despite the outward appearance of perfection, there was an undeniable unease to the place. The air felt thick, heavy, and the silence, broken only by the landscapers' clippers and the distant cries of children playing in the park, was stifling. It was the kind of silence that screamed something was being deliberately suppressed, a secret lurking beneath the carefully maintained surface, much like the festering clog that Thomas was now being paid handsomely to find. He just hoped that whatever was causing the problem wouldn't need any more than his trusty wrench and a good dose of Drain-O. He had a feeling this job was going to be a whole lot messier than he anticipated.
