## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights of Dr. Agarwal’s office hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack that was, on most days, soothingly predictable. But not today. Today, it felt like a buzzing insect trapped behind Amelia Jane Peterson’s eyeballs. She squeezed the grip of the Cavitron scaler just a little too tight, causing the high-pitched whine to deepen as it vibrated against Mr. Henderson’s lower molars.

"Sorry about that, Mr. Henderson," Amelia mumbled, pulling the instrument away and adjusting the suction. "Just a bit… zealous today."

Mr. Henderson, whose mouth was stretched wide open and braced with cheek retractors, could only offer a muffled groan of understanding. Amelia winced internally. Zealous was an understatement. She felt wired, jittery, like she’d mainline espresso instead of her usual lukewarm green tea. The reason, of course, was tucked neatly in the pocket of her lab coat, buzzing louder than the Cavitron: a small, velvet box containing a ring, and the crushing weight of a life-altering decision.

## Setting:

The setting is the "Agarwal Family Dentistry" practice, located in a bustling suburb of Chicago, Illinois. The office is a blend of modern aesthetics and traditional dental comfort. Neutral beige walls are punctuated by vibrant abstract art, carefully chosen by Dr. Agarwal's wife, Priya, to create a calming atmosphere. The waiting room features comfortable, oversized armchairs, a selection of magazines, and a small, well-maintained fish tank. The treatment rooms, however, are more sterile and functional, equipped with state-of-the-art dental equipment, ergonomic chairs for both patient and hygienist, and large windows offering a view of the tree-lined street outside. Sunlight filters through the blinds, providing a slightly warmer, less clinical feel. The overall impression is of a professional and welcoming environment, designed to alleviate the anxieties typically associated with a trip to the dentist.
