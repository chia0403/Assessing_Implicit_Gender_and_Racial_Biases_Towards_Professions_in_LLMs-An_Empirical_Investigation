## Story Opening and Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The scream of the saw bit into the pre-dawn quiet, a sound that both assaulted and comforted Silas Bartholomew Thorne. He hadn't heard birdsong for weeks, only the relentless whine of metal teeth chewing through redwood. His hands, thick and calloused as old tree bark, gripped the bar with practiced ease, guiding the saw with an almost intuitive understanding. He’d been logging these woods since he was knee-high to a grasshopper, and he knew the groan of a falling tree like he knew his own heartbeat. But today, the forest held a different song, a low hum that resonated in his bones, a feeling he couldn’t quite place, like the ghost of a forgotten memory lingering in the air.

**Setting:**

The year is 1938. Silas works in the dense, ancient redwood forests of Northern California, near a small, dwindling logging town called Redwood Creek. The air is perpetually damp, heavy with the scent of pine and damp earth. Towering redwoods, giants that have stood for centuries, dominate the landscape, their thick, rust-colored bark scarred from years of logging. The forest floor is a tapestry of ferns, moss, and decaying leaves, punctuated by fallen branches and the stumps of felled trees, stark reminders of the industry that fuels the town. Redwood Creek itself is a ramshackle collection of wooden houses, a general store, a saloon, and the ever-present lumber mill, its deafening roar a constant soundtrack to the lives of its inhabitants. It's a hard place, unforgiving and demanding, but it's home to Silas Bartholomew Thorne, and he knows no other life.
