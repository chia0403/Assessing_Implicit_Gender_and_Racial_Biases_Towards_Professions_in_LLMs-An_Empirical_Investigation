The rooster’s crow was a rusty hinge scraping across the dawn sky, but Jedediah Silas Bartlett barely registered it. He was already out of bed, his long, calloused fingers fumbling for the worn leather of his boots. The chill of the unfinished pine floor seeped into his bones, a familiar discomfort he'd known since he was a boy. Outside, the first weak rays of sunlight painted the dew-kissed fields a pale, hopeful gold.

Jedediah’s farm, Bartlett’s Bountiful Acres, was a sprawling tapestry of green and brown woven across the gentle slopes of Harmony Valley. Nestled deep within the Appalachian Mountains of West Virginia, it was a place of quiet beauty and relentless labor. Generations of Bartletts had tilled this land, wrestling a living from its rocky soil and enduring the unpredictable whims of mountain weather. The old farmhouse, a sturdy two-story structure built from hand-hewn logs, stood as a testament to their resilience, its weathered face etched with the stories of droughts, floods, and harvests both abundant and meager. This morning, the air hung thick with the promise of rain, and Jedediah knew he had a long day ahead of him before the storm broke. He had to get the last of the hay baled and the tomato crop covered. The summer was fading, and winter in the mountains was a harsh mistress.
