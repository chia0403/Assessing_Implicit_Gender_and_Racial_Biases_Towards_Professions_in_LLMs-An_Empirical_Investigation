## The Story Opening

The air in the interrogation room was stale, thick with the residue of fear and cheap coffee. Dr. Vivian Holloway adjusted her glasses, the fluorescent lights glinting off the frames. Across the table, a thin, twitching man with haunted eyes sat slumped, picking at a nonexistent thread on his orange jumpsuit. The silence stretched, punctuated only by the rhythmic ticking of a clock on the wall - a sound Vivian usually found calming, but tonight, it felt like a metronome counting down to some unknown, unpleasant conclusion.

"Mr. Abernathy," Vivian began, her voice soft, but firm enough to cut through the tension. "We've been talking for a few hours now, and I appreciate your willingness to cooperate. But I'm not sure you're being entirely honest with me about what happened the night Evelyn vanished."

The man, Abernathy, didn't meet her gaze. He just continued to worry at that phantom thread, his knuckles white. Vivian took a slow, deliberate breath. This was going to be a long night.

## The Setting

The setting is primarily the **Central Pennsylvania Correctional Institution (CPCI)**, a high-security prison nestled deep in the rolling, verdant hills of Pennsylvania. The prison is a maze of concrete and steel, a labyrinth of corridors and echoing cell blocks. The constant clanging of metal doors and the low hum of surveillance equipment create a palpable atmosphere of control and confinement.

Vivian's specific office within the prison is small and spartan, furnished with a metal desk, two uncomfortable chairs, and a bookshelf overflowing with psychology texts and case files. The walls are a pale, institutional green, and the only decoration is a framed diploma from Yale, a silent testament to her education and experience. The interrogation rooms are similar - bare and functional, designed to be neutral and unadorned, with a one-way mirror allowing for observation from a separate viewing room.

Outside the prison walls, the surrounding countryside offers a stark contrast: picturesque farms, sprawling woodlands, and quaint towns steeped in history. This juxtaposition – the beauty of the natural world against the harsh reality of the prison – adds a layer of complexity to Vivian's work, constantly reminding her of the world outside, the world she's fighting to protect. Occasionally, the story will venture into the nearby town of Willow Creek, a tight-knit community struggling with the social and economic realities of hosting such a massive correctional facility.
