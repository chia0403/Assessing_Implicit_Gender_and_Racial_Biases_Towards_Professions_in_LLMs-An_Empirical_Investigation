## Story Opening:

The splinter nestled deep beneath Jasper Tiberius Finch's thumbnail throbbed in time with the low hum of the power sander. He ignored it, the familiar discomfort a constant companion in his workshop, a badge of honour more than an annoyance. He was chasing the perfect curve, the flawless union of cherry wood and maple that would bring his latest creation to life. He could practically taste the linseed oil finish already, smell the rich, earthy aroma that would permeate the air when the final piece was complete. Outside, the wind howled a mournful song against the corrugated iron roof of his workshop, but inside, nestled amongst the dust and the scent of cut timber, Jasper found a strange sort of solace. Tonight, however, that solace felt fragile, threatened by a growing unease that clawed at the edges of his focus.

## Setting:

Jasper Tiberius Finch's workshop, christened "The Finch's Nest" with a hand-painted sign featuring a rather plump and optimistic-looking finch, was perched precariously on the edge of the Blackwood Forest. The building itself was a haphazard collection of corrugated iron and salvaged timber, a testament to Jasper's resourcefulness and questionable architectural skills. Sunlight, when it dared to penetrate the dense canopy of the surrounding woods, streamed through grimy, leaded-glass windows salvaged from a demolished Victorian house, casting fragmented patterns across the cluttered interior.

The space was a chaotic symphony of tools, wood shavings, and half-finished projects. Hand saws hung from hooks beside a collection of chisels, their blades gleaming dully under the dim light of a naked bulb. Sacks of sawdust lined one wall, smelling faintly of pine and cedar. Tables groaned under the weight of unfinished chairs, wobbly-legged stools, and intricately carved wooden boxes, each piece a testament to Jasper's unique vision and meticulous craftsmanship. Outside, a small, overgrown garden fought a losing battle against the encroaching forest, a testament to Jasper's dedication to his craft, which left little time for tending to earthly concerns. The air hung thick with the scent of wood, oil, and the faint, metallic tang of machinery, a scent that had permeated Jasper's clothes and his very being.
