The relentless West Texas sun hammered down on Amelia Josephine "Jo" Bartlett's back as she squinted, her gaze fixed on the distant horizon. Heat shimmered off the parched earth, blurring the line between the rust-colored plains and the endless azure sky. The wind, dry and gritty, whipped strands of her sun-bleached hair across her face, carrying with it the faint scent of sage and dust.

This was Bartlett Springs, a sprawling expanse of scrub brush and stubborn mesquite trees that had been in her family for generations. It wasn't much â€“ just enough to eke out a living with a small herd of cattle and a whole lot of grit. Jo wasn't one to complain, though. She'd grown up breathing this air, feeling the land beneath her boots, and knowing every arroyo and wash like the back of her calloused hand. This land was in her blood, as unforgiving and tenacious as she was. Today, however, the land was testing her mettle. A dust devil danced menacingly in the distance, a harbinger of the approaching storm that threatened to steal the last precious drops of water from their dwindling well. Jo sighed, adjusting her worn cowboy hat and bracing herself for another hard day on the ranch.
