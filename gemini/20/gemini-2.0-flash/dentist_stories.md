The high-pitched whine of the drill, a sound Dr. Eleanor Vivian Hawthorne had grown to both love and loathe, filled the small, brightly lit surgery. Outside, the late afternoon sun painted the quaint storefronts of Havenwood, Ohio in a warm, honeyed glow, but inside, the battle against plaque and decay raged on. Eleanor, her brow furrowed in concentration, adjusted her magnifying loupes and leaned closer to Mrs. Gable's gaping maw. The older woman, bless her heart, was humming a tuneless rendition of "The Old Grey Mare" despite the suction tube precariously perched on her tongue.

Eleanor’s office, Hawthorne Dental, was a comforting haven of soft blues and cheerful sunflowers. She'd painstakingly curated the space to be the opposite of the sterile, intimidating dentist’s office of nightmares. Photos of Havenwood's annual Pumpkin Festival, in which she religiously participated, hung on the walls alongside framed certificates from her numerous continuing education courses. A small fish tank, bubbling merrily, contained a handful of brightly coloured guppies that were supposed to distract nervous children (and, sometimes, equally nervous adults).

Havenwood itself was a postcard-perfect small town, the kind where everyone knew your name and your favorite brand of coffee. Nestled amongst rolling hills and sprawling apple orchards, it was a place where life moved at a slower pace, and gossip, like the changing seasons, was a constant. Eleanor had come to Havenwood fresh out of dental school, seeking a simpler life and a chance to make a real difference in a community. Years later, she couldn’t imagine practicing anywhere else.
