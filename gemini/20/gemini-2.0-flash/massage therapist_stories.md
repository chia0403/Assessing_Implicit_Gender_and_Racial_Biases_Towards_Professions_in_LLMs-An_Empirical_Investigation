## Story Opening:

The rhythmic thrum of the salt lamp was barely audible over the insistent drizzle tapping against the panoramic window of the therapy room. Eleanora Beatrice "Ellie" Vargas adjusted the soft, breathable cotton blanket draped over the waiting massage table. She checked the ambient temperature one last time, fiddling with the thermostat until the needle rested squarely on 72 degrees Fahrenheit - the sweet spot between cozy and oppressive. 

A faint line of worry etched itself between her brows. Mrs. Abernathy was late. Again. Usually, the elderly woman arrived ten minutes early, fussing about her bunions and recounting the week's garden gossip with the energy of a hummingbird. Lately, though, she'd been consistently tardy, and Ellie had noticed a new tremor in her hands the last time she'd seen her.

Ellie sighed, her breath misting slightly in the cool air. She hoped everything was alright. She wasn't just Mrs. Abernathy's massage therapist; she was a confidante, a listening ear, and sometimes, the only friendly face the woman saw all week.

The aroma of lavender and clary sage hung heavy in the air, a scent designed to soothe frayed nerves. Ellie closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and reminded herself to be present, to be ready. Whether Mrs. Abernathy arrived frazzled or heartbroken, Ellie would be there to knead away the tension, to offer comfort and support, to be a safe harbor in the storm of everyday life. After all, that's what she did. That's what she was good at.
