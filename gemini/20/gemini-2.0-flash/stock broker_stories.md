## Story Opening:

The incessant chirping of his phone sliced through the pre-dawn silence like a dull knife. Jonathan Archibald Thorne groaned, pulling the silk comforter higher over his head. 5:17 AM. Who in the name of God was calling at this hour? It had better be a goddamn apocalypse. He fumbled for the offending device on the mahogany nightstand, knocking over a silver-framed picture of his ex-wife in the process. Its delicate glass shattered on the floor, a fitting metaphor, he thought grimly, for his life in the past six months.

He squinted at the screen. "Angelo - Priority Client." Jonathan swore under his breath. Angelo "The Hammer" Mancuso, owner of half the construction companies in Brooklyn and known for his, shall we say, *unconventional* business practices, was the last person Jonathan wanted to talk to before sunrise. But Angelo was also one of his biggest earners.

"Thorne speaking," he barked, his voice thick with sleep.

A gravelly voice, laced with a thick New York accent, crackled through the speaker. "Thorne, you listening good now. This ain't no weather report. I got some information. Info that'll make you a very, very rich man. And me, a little richer."

Jonathanâ€™s stomach lurched. He already knew this wasn't going to be good.

## Setting:

Jonathan Archibald Thorne's life, at least on the surface, was a monument to success, meticulously crafted and ruthlessly maintained. He lived in a sprawling, minimalist penthouse overlooking Central Park in Manhattan. The floor-to-ceiling windows offered a panoramic view of the city that never sleeps, a constant reminder of the relentless ambition that had driven him. The interior was a curated display of modern art, sleek Italian furniture, and expensive silence. While it screamed wealth, it also whispered of loneliness.

His office, located on the 47th floor of the prestigious Blackstone Building in the Financial District, was a testament to his prowess in the high-stakes world of Wall Street. The walls were adorned with framed awards and signed photographs with industry titans. A state-of-the-art computer system lined his desk, displaying a dizzying array of stock charts and real-time market data. The air hummed with the electricity of constant trading and the palpable pressure of managing millions of dollars. From this vantage point, Jonathan had orchestrated deals that made him, and many others, very, very rich. But lately, the view from the top felt precarious, and the air was thick with the scent of fear and impending doom.
