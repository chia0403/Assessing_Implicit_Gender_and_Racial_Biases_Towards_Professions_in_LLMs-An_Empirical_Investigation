Dust motes danced in the weak beams of sunlight slicing through the blinds, highlighting the swirling currents of the lone ceiling fan.

His reflection in the antique, silvered mirror showed a man perpetually on the verge of a sigh. He was a creature of habit, a master of the close shave and the perfectly faded sideburn. But today, even the rhythmic snip of his shears felt discordant, a clatter in the quiet symphony of his carefully curated routine. Outside, the humid air promised another sweltering day, and inside, Bart felt a storm brewing in his own soul. He just couldn't put his finger on why.
