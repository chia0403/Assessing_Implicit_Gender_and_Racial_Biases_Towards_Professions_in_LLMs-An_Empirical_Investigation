The fluorescent lights of the KXHR studio hummed a mournful tune, a counterpoint to the silence of the pre-dawn airwaves. Rain lashed against the windowpanes of the small booth, mirroring the drumming anxiety in the chest of Barnaby Quincey Featherstonehaugh the Third. He adjusted the gain on the ancient Collins console, the knobs cold and slick under his clammy fingers. At 4:57 AM, the air was thick with anticipation, laced with the subtle ozone scent of overworked electronics.

KXHR-AM, nestled in the sleepy valley town of Harmony Creek, Colorado, was a dinosaur in the age of streaming. Barnaby, a man whose soul resided in the vacuum tubes and crackling static of a bygone era, was its reluctant keeper. He’d inherited the station, along with his late uncle’s eccentric tendencies and a near-encyclopedic knowledge of obscure jazz, six months ago. Harmony Creek itself was a place clinging stubbornly to the past, where the general store still accepted IOUs and the mayor's announcements were transcribed by hand on a mimeograph machine. It was the perfect, albeit precarious, refuge for a man who felt as out of step with the modern world as the station he now ran. But tonight, the familiar comfort of the analog world was about to be shattered, replaced by something unsettling, something emanating not from a dusty record, but from the very fabric of the airwaves themselves.
