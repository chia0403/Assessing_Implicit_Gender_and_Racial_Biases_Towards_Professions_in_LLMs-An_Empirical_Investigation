The chipped mug warmed Jethro Ezekiel Wainwright's calloused hands as he watched the dawn bleed over the Nevada desert. It wasn't a pretty dawn, not like the sunrises over the Smoky Mountains he remembered from his boyhood, but it was a dawn nonetheless, and in this endless expanse of scrub and sand, that was something. Jethro stood on the dusty shoulder of Highway 93, squinting into the growing light, the wind tugging at his worn denim jacket and whipping strands of his salt-and-pepper hair across his face.

He'd parked "The Wanderer," his eighteen-wheeler, just outside the town of Caliente, a place that seemed to consist solely of a gas station, a diner boasting "World Famous Chili" (which Jethro suspected was a gross exaggeration), and a motel with peeling paint and flickering neon signs. The Wanderer, a Kenworth W900 with over a million miles on the clock, was Jethro's home, his office, and his companion on the long, lonely stretches of American highway. Right now, it was smelling faintly of the load of industrial-grade rubber he was hauling to San Diego, a smell he'd become surprisingly fond of. He took a swig of the lukewarm coffee, a necessary evil to ward off the sleep that threatened to pull him back into the land of oblivion after only a few hours of fitful rest. This leg of the journey was going to be a long one, and Jethro Ezekiel Wainwright, trucker extraordinaire, had miles to go before he could sleep.
