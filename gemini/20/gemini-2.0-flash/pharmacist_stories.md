The air in the apothecary hung thick with the scent of dried chamomile and something vaguely medicinal, a fragrance familiar enough to Elias Thorne that he barely registered it anymore. Outside, the cobbled streets of Havenwood buzzed with the late afternoon energy of shoppers and merchants haggling over prices, a stark contrast to the quiet sanctuary he'd cultivated within the walls of Thorne & Son Apothecary.

Elias, his brow furrowed in concentration, carefully measured out a precise dose of belladonna extract for Mrs. Higgins, a woman plagued by recurring migraines, a steady hand the only hint of the turmoil swirling within him. He’d inherited the apothecary from his father, a legacy he cherished and yet…a cage gilded in the sweet aroma of honeyed cough syrup.
