Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a bellhop named Bartholomew Reginald Peabody:

**Story Opening:**

The weight of the monogrammed steamer trunk strained Bartholomew Reginald Peabody’s back as he wrestled it off the luggage cart. He hated these antique monstrosities. People clung to them for sentimental reasons, no doubt, but Bartholomew clung to the hope that one day the wealthy elite of the Hotel Grand Majestic would embrace lighter, more efficient travel options. Gritting his teeth, he shifted his grip, the brass corner digging into his gloved palm. The trunk’s destination, Suite 412, was all the way at the end of the east wing, a veritable pilgrimage for a bellhop nearing the end of a twelve-hour shift. He straightened, adjusted his pillbox hat, and pasted on his most charming smile. Tonight, he was Bartholomew Peabody, the epitome of impeccable service, not Bartholomew Peabody, the aspiring playwright who spent his lunch breaks scribbling dialogue on napkins. He just hoped the suite’s occupant tipped well. Last time he'd helped a guest on the 4th floor he'd received nothing but a 'thank you.' That wouldn't pay the rent. He took a deep breath and began his trek.

**Setting:**

The story takes place in the Hotel Grand Majestic, a sprawling and opulent hotel in the heart of New Orleans, Louisiana in the year 1928. Imagine a building steeped in history, its architecture a blend of French Colonial elegance and Art Deco flair. Crystal chandeliers illuminate marble floors, casting shimmering light on the intricate ironwork balconies that overlook the bustling city streets. The air is thick with the scent of gardenias and the murmur of polite conversation, occasionally punctuated by the lively strains of jazz music drifting from the hotel’s grand ballroom. The lobby is a constant hive of activity, a whirlwind of arriving guests, scurrying staff, and the hushed secrets exchanged between the city’s elite. The hotel serves as a microcosm of 1920s society: glittering on the surface, but with shadows lurking beneath the veneer of prosperity and propriety.
