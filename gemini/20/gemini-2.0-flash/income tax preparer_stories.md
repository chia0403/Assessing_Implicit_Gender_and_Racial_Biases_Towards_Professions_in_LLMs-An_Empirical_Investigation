Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring an income tax preparer:

**Setting:**

The office of "Penny Pinchers Tax Services," located in a strip mall on the outskirts of suburban Willow Creek, Minnesota.  The decor is relentlessly cheerful â€“ motivational posters featuring kittens hanging on with slogans like "Hang In There!" and "Never Give Up!", along with a fake ficus tree in the corner shedding plastic leaves. The color scheme is an unfortunate combination of beige and faded teal. It's mid-April, tax season is in its final, frenzied days, and the air crackles with stress and the scent of stale coffee.

**Opening:**

The rhythmic *thwack* of Stanley Kowalski's stapler echoed through the office, a metronome marking the slow, painful march to the April 15th deadline. Sweat prickled his brow under the harsh fluorescent lights, despite the thermostat perpetually set to "arctic" by Mrs. Henderson, the office manager. He squinted at the W-2 form swimming before his eyes, the numbers blurring into a maddening, pixelated landscape. Stanley Kowalski, Certified Public Accountant (though the certificate was gathering dust somewhere in his attic), had once dreamed of a life filled with high finance, complex mergers, and maybe even a private jet. Instead, he was spending his days deciphering the scribbled receipts of Mrs. Higgins from down the street, who insisted on deducting the cost of organic cat food as a "business expense" for her emotional support feline, Mr. Fluffernutter.
