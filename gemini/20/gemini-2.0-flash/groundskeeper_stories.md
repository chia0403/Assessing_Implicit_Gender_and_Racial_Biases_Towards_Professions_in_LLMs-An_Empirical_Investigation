Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a groundskeeper named Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins:

**Setting:**

The story opens in the late afternoon, bordering on dusk, at the crumbling, gothic estate known as Blackwood Manor. Nestled deep within the ancient Blackwood Forest in the heart of the English countryside, the Manor is a sprawling behemoth of darkened stone, clawing its way towards the perpetually overcast sky. Ivy, thick as pythons, chokes its walls, obscuring gargoyles and stained-glass windows. The once manicured gardens are now a tangled wilderness, a testament to years of neglect and whispered rumors of hauntings. The air is perpetually damp and carries the scent of decaying leaves, damp earth, and a faint, almost metallic, tang that Bartholomew can never quite place. The only light comes from the skeletal branches of the surrounding trees, a meager attempt to hold back the encroaching darkness.

**Story Opening:**

Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins sighed, the sound a puff of condensation in the chilling air, as he leaned on the handle of his battered wheelbarrow. The barrow was laden with dead leaves and broken branches, the spoils of his losing battle against the encroaching wilderness that was Blackwood Manor. He was a small man, Bart, barely five-foot-six, with a perpetually worried frown etched onto his face and hands calloused beyond recognition. For the past twenty years, he'd been the sole groundskeeper of this desolate estate, a task that felt less like a job and more like a penance. He straightened his worn tweed cap, pulling it further down over his thinning grey hair. He knew he should probably head back to his cottage, a tiny, ramshackle affair that huddled against the manor's stable wall like a frightened child. But the light, meager as it was, was fading fast, and the shadows around Blackwood Manor had a way of playing tricks on the eyes, and the ears. He shivered, not entirely from the cold, and hefted the wheelbarrow handles again. One more trip, he told himself. Just one more trip to the compost heap, and then he'd be safe inside, with a steaming mug of tea and the company of his old, one-eyed cat, Grimalkin. But as he pushed the wheelbarrow past the overgrown rose garden, he heard it: a faint, almost imperceptible sound, like the tinkling of glass, coming from somewhere deep within the manor itself. And Bart knew, with a sinking feeling in his gut, that tonight, he wouldn't be having that cup of tea anytime soon.
