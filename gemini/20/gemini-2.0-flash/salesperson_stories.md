The fluorescent lights of the Mid-American Auto Mall hummed a monotonous drone, a soundtrack to the quiet desperation simmering beneath its gleaming surfaces. Outside, the late October wind whipped fallen leaves across the asphalt, a restless dance mirroring the anxiety gnawing at Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins' gut. He stood, ramrod straight despite the ache in his lower back from a too-hard chair and too many hours spent glued to it, behind the polished oak desk of "Higgins' Heroes," his tiny corner of the sprawling empire that was Miller Motors.

Bart straightened his already straight tie, the silk a vibrant, arguably gaudy, electric blue against the sterile grey of his suit. He chewed the inside of his cheek, a nervous habit heâ€™d tried unsuccessfully to break since high school. It was 9:03 AM, and so far, the only action he'd seen was Mrs. Henderson from accounting popping in to ask if he had any candy. Sales were down across the board, Miller Motors was feeling the pinch, and Bart knew, with a certainty that chilled him to the bone, that his "heroic" efforts hadn't exactly been saving the day. This month, he was on track to sell... well, maybe not even one car. He needed a miracle, or at least a vaguely interested customer. He needed, desperately, to not become another casualty of the cutbacks he knew were coming.
