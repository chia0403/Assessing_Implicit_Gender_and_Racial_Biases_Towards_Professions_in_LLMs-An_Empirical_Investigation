## Story Opening:

The persistent aroma of eucalyptus and anxiety hung thick in the air, a cocktail that permeated Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Vance's senses the moment she unlocked the door to her practice, "Spine & Soul Chiropractic." It was Monday morning, and the weekendâ€™s worth of pent-up tension from overworked parents and weekend warrior athletes was already seeping into the building.

Ellie sighed, dropping her oversized handbag on the worn leather armchair in the waiting room. Outside, the November rain lashed against the large picture window, blurring the already drab landscape of downtown Willow Creek, Oregon. The town, nestled in the foothills of the Cascades, was known more for its lumber mills and perpetually damp weather than for cutting-edge healthcare. But Ellie had found a quiet corner there, a place where she could practice her craft, offering more than just a crack and a referral. She believed in treating the whole person, not just the symptoms.

She glanced at the appointment book sitting on Mrs. Henderson's desk. Mrs. Henderson, her endlessly cheerful (and occasionally overly helpful) receptionist, wouldn't arrive for another hour. A quick scan revealed a packed day: old Mrs. Gable with her recurring sciatica, young Michael Peterson with his tech neck, and, as always, a few unexpected walk-ins clutching their backs in agony.

Ellie rubbed her temples, the scent of the aromatherapy diffusing from the corner still failing to penetrate the fog in her own head. Today, she knew, would be a marathon. And as she straightened her crisp white coat and prepared for the first patient, she couldn't shake the feeling that something, besides the usual Monday morning chaos, was about to shift in Spine & Soul.
