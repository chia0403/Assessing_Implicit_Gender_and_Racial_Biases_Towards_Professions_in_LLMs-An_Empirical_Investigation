## Story Opening and Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The biting wind off Lake Michigan whipped at Dr. Eleanor Grace Ashland's face as she hurried across the snow-dusted parking lot of Mercy Hospital. It was a bone-chilling January evening in Chicago, a city known for its resilience, a quality Eleanor felt keenly aware she was lacking at that very moment. Three missed calls from the ER already flashed on her phone, a silent, insistent plea for her presence. Each one a hammer blow against the precarious wall she'd built around herself sinceâ€¦ well, since it all fell apart. She tightened her grip on her worn leather medical bag, the familiar weight a small comfort, and prayed, not for the first time that day, that whatever awaited her inside those brightly lit doors wasn't more than she could handle.
**Setting:**

The story opens in present-day Chicago, Illinois, primarily focusing on the interior of Mercy Hospital, specifically the surgical wing and emergency room. Chicago's brutal winter weather plays a significant role, both as a literal backdrop and a metaphorical representation of the emotional chill Eleanor experiences. The hospital is a sprawling, aging structure, a mix of modern technology and older, slightly dilapidated architecture. The city itself, with its bustling energy and inherent grit, subtly influences the characters and events of the story.
