Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a clinical psychologist:

**Setting:** A small, meticulously organized office on the third floor of a converted Victorian house in the historic district of Savannah, Georgia. Sunlight streams through the tall, lace-curtained windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. The room is painted a calming shade of pale sage, and the soft murmur of traffic barely penetrates the thick walls. A worn Persian rug anchors the space, its intricate patterns faded with time. Two comfortable, overstuffed armchairs face each other across a low, mahogany coffee table. On the table sits a box of tissues and a small, unassuming succulent. The air smells faintly of jasmine and beeswax.

**Story Opening:**

The rhythmic tick-tock of the antique grandfather clock in the hallway was the only sound competing with the controlled cadence of Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth's voice. "And when did you first notice theseâ€¦ 'intrusive thoughts,' Mr. Davies?" she asked, her tone gentle but firm. She adjusted her glasses, her gaze steady and empathetic as she observed the man fidgeting in the armchair opposite her. Outside, the mournful wail of a distant foghorn drifted through the open window, a sound so familiar in Savannah that most residents barely registered it. Eleanor, however, found it strangely fitting, a somber counterpoint to the anxieties bubbling to the surface in the small, sun-drenched room. She picked up her pen, ready to record yet another detail in the tapestry of anxieties that walked through her door each day. Another piece of a broken puzzle she would attempt to mend. Today, it was Mr. Davies, but tomorrow it would be someone else, each of them a new story etched onto the soul of this ancient city, a story that Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth was determined to help them tell.
