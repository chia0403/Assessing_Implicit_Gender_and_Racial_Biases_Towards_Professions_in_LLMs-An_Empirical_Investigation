## Story Opening:

The insistent shrill of the landline ripped through the pre-dawn stillness, jolting Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins from a dream where he was being chased by a giant claim form. He groaned, pawing at the bedside table until he located the offending device. The green numbers glowed accusingly: 5:17 AM.

"Higgins Insurance, Bart speaking, ready to secure your future," he mumbled, his voice thick with sleep. He hadn't even bothered to check the caller ID. He rarely did. Bad news didn't usually care what time it was.

A voice, thin and reedy, crackled on the other end. "Mr. Higgins? This is Mildred Grimshaw… from number 14 Willow Creek Lane?"

Bart's stomach clenched. Mildred Grimshaw. His oldest and, arguably, most neurotic client. "Yes, Mrs. Grimshaw? Is everything alright?" he asked, already bracing himself for the worst. He’d insured her life, her house, her prize-winning begonias, and, if she'd had her way, her recently deceased goldfish, Finnegan.

"Alright? Alright?! Mr. Higgins, I believe my hedge is trying to kill me!"

Bart scrubbed a hand over his face. "Your…hedge, Mrs. Grimshaw?"

"Yes! The prize-winning cypress hedge I insured with you! It's… it's moving! And it's… menacing!"

## Setting:

The story opens in Bart Higgins' modest, two-story clapboard house in the sleepy, postcard-perfect town of Havenwood, Connecticut. His bedroom is small and cluttered, dominated by a double bed piled high with mismatched quilts and surrounded by stacks of insurance brochures and half-read mystery novels. A dusty trophy for "Most Attentive Insurance Agent - Tri-County Area" sits precariously on his overflowing bookshelf. The walls are painted a forgettable beige, doing little to brighten the room, which is lit only by the harsh, early morning glow of the digital clock. Outside, the first birds are beginning their dawn chorus, a stark contrast to the chaos threatening to erupt within the confines of Bart's increasingly frantic morning. The crisp autumn air, hinting at the changing leaves and impending winter, carries a faint scent of woodsmoke and the promise of another day in the bewildering world of insurance.
