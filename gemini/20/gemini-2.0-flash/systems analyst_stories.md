The flickering fluorescent lights of the server room hummed a monotonous lullaby, a sound that usually soothed Abigail Mae Harding.

Abigail, a systems analyst for the sprawling, multinational conglomerate OmniCorp, pressed a cold can of energy drink against her forehead, willing the throbbing ache behind her eyes to subside.

The server room itself, nestled deep within the building's fortified core, was a labyrinth of blinking lights, snaking cables, and humming server racks. A constant chill emanated from the industrial-strength cooling system, designed to keep the delicate machinery from overheating under the strain of processing billions of transactions every day.

Something was wrong, terribly wrong, and Abigail Mae Harding was the only one who seemed to notice.
