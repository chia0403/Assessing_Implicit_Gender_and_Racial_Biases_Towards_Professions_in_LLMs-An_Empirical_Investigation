## Story Opening:

The stale coffee tasted like burnt pennies, a flavour Beatrice Eleanor Holloway had become intimately acquainted with over the past few weeks. She swirled the dregs in the chipped mug, the harsh fluorescent light of the office reflecting in the dark liquid. Outside, a relentless downpour hammered against the grimy windows of the *Havenwood Herald*, mimicking the relentless hammering of doubt in her own chest.

Another dead end. Another brick wall.

Beatrice sighed, the sound swallowed by the incessant drumming of the rain. She was supposed to be on deadline, supposed to be polishing the story about the upcoming town council elections, a puff piece so dull it practically glittered with boredom. But Beatrice couldn't shake the feeling that something bigger was brewing beneath the sleepy surface of Havenwood. Something darker. Something connected to the whispers, the furtive glances, the hushed conversations that seemed to cease the moment she walked into a room.

She glanced at the worn manila folder on her desk, the one labeled "Disappearances - Unsolved." It was a forbidden fruit, a rabbit hole dug deep by her own insatiable curiosity. Three people had vanished from Havenwood in the past year, each disappearance dismissed as a runaway teenager, a disgruntled employee seeking a new life. But Beatrice saw a pattern, a thread of unease that connected them all.

A sudden crack of thunder rattled the building. Beatrice jumped, spilling a few drops of the offensive coffee onto her already cluttered desk. It was a sign, she decided, a nudge from the universe. She pushed the council election article aside, pulled the "Disappearances" file closer, and began to read. Havenwood held secrets, and Beatrice Eleanor Holloway was determined to unearth them, one burnt-penny-flavored coffee at a time.

## Setting:

**Havenwood, a small, isolated town nestled in the misty mountains of western North Carolina.**

* **Atmosphere:** The town is steeped in a history of folklore and tradition, but beneath the quaint facade lies a palpable sense of unease and unspoken secrets. The surrounding mountains often cloak the town in fog, adding to the feeling of isolation and mystery.

* **The *Havenwood Herald*:** The local newspaper, a small, struggling operation housed in a crumbling Victorian building on Main Street. The office is perpetually cluttered, filled with stacks of old newspapers, overflowing ashtrays, and the lingering aroma of cheap coffee and desperation. The staff is small and overworked, mostly consisting of long-time residents who are content with reporting on local bake sales and garden club meetings.

* **The town square:** A central gathering place, anchored by a weathered Civil War monument and surrounded by quaint shops selling locally made crafts and antiques. However, the square often feels deserted, especially during the off-season, adding to the town's unsettling atmosphere.

* **The surrounding mountains:** Towering, imposing, and often shrouded in mist, the mountains serve as a constant reminder of the town's isolation and the secrets they may be hiding. Legend has it that the mountains are haunted by the spirits of early settlers and Native Americans.

This setting provides a backdrop for the story's themes of secrets, isolation, and the clash between tradition and progress. The small-town atmosphere and the unsettling atmosphere of the surrounding mountains will contribute to the suspense and mystery surrounding the disappearances that Beatrice is investigating.
