Okay, here's a story opening and setting focusing on an editor named Eleanor Vance:

**Opening:**

Eleanor Vance hadn't slept properly in a week. The constant hum of the fluorescent lights in her tiny office seemed to burrow directly into her skull, amplifying the pressure behind her eyes. Each blink felt like wading through treacle. Tonight, though, the insomnia wasn’t just due to the soul-crushing weight of her impending deadline, but a genuine, creeping dread that settled in her stomach like a cold stone. It had started with the manuscript. A rambling, unsettling mess of a historical fantasy titled *The Obsidian Grimoire*, submitted anonymously to Obsidian Books with nothing more than a post office box address.

**Setting:**

The story takes place in the decidedly unglamorous, yet fiercely independent offices of **Obsidian Books**, a small, struggling publishing house nestled above a discount laundromat in the heart of Minneapolis’s warehouse district. The building itself is a faded brick behemoth, its windows coated in a permanent film of grime and the echoing whispers of a hundred forgotten textile factories.

Inside, Obsidian Books occupies the entire third floor. The air is thick with the scent of old paper, cheap coffee, and a lingering desperation that clings to the exposed brick walls. Eleanor's office is a cramped, windowless cubicle crammed with teetering stacks of manuscripts, dog-eared dictionaries, and half-eaten takeout containers. A single, wilting philodendron sits precariously on the edge of her desk, a silent testament to her neglect and the overall air of cheerful entropy. The walls are adorned with rejection slips framed by her coworkers as 'Motivation' and a slightly-off kilter poster advertising the company's only modest success, a self-help guide for cat owners.
