The flickering fluorescent lights of the office hummed a monotonous song, a lullaby that usually soothed Reginald Arthur Pruitt into a near-catatonic state of focus. Today, however, the hum only amplified the pounding in his temples. Reginald, hunched over a spreadsheet that displayed more shades of red than a tomato farm in July, felt a bead of sweat trickle down his back. It was a Tuesday, and the fiscal quarter was ending. He hated Tuesdays. He also hated ending fiscal quarters. But more than anything, Reginald Arthur Pruitt, Certified Public Accountant, hated discrepancies of more than five dollars. And this one, staring him down like a gargoyle from the depths of line 47, was a staggering $78.32.

The setting was the fifth floor of the "Financial Solutions Plaza," a building as inspiring as its name suggested. Constructed in the early 80s, its beige exterior housed a labyrinthine network of cubicles, each containing a soul diligently wrestling with numbers. Reginald's cubicle, number 512, was strategically located near the communal coffee machine (a blessing and a curse, given the frequency of malfunctioning and the resulting grounds-splattered chaos). It was decorated sparsely, only boasting a framed photo of his tabby cat, Mittens (a creature of unwavering loyalty and impeccable napping skills), and a motivational poster featuring a dolphin leaping majestically above the phrase: "Strive for Excellence!" Reginald often wondered if the dolphin truly understood the existential dread of double-entry bookkeeping. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee, photocopier toner, and quiet desperation. Outside, the city of Bridgeport, Connecticut, buzzed with a chaotic energy Reginald preferred to ignore. Inside, in the sterile confines of Financial Solutions Plaza, order – or at least the illusion of it – reigned supreme. Or it *should* have. Hence, the $78.32 problem.
