## Story Opening & Setting:

**Opening:**

The infernal whine of the string trimmer was a constant companion, a buzzing mosquito lodged permanently in Bartholomew 'Bart' Finch's ear. He hated the thing, hated the smell of scorched grass, hated the way his hands vibrated for hours after he'd finished for the day. But Bart Finch needed the money. Badly. And right now, battling the tenacious weeds that clung to the rose bushes like desperate claws was the difference between having ramen for dinner and havingâ€¦ well, more ramen for dinner. He squinted against the glare reflecting off the manicured lawn, wiping a bead of sweat that threatened to sting his eye. The air hung thick and heavy, pregnant with the promise of a summer storm.

**Setting:**

Bart works for "Nature's Touch," a small, family-owned landscaping company based in the affluent suburb of Willow Creek, Connecticut. Today he's at the sprawling estate of Mrs. Beatrice Van Derlyn, a notoriously demanding and eccentric socialite. The estate is known locally as "Van Derlyn Manor" and is a testament to old money and meticulously cultivated perfection. The grounds boast formal gardens overflowing with rare and exotic plants, a sprawling green lawn that stretches to the edge of the nearby lake, and a collection of ornate fountains and statues that seem to judge every blade of grass out of place. The main house, a gothic revival mansion, looms in the background, its dark stone walls draped in ivy, a silent observer to Bart's daily grind. While Willow Creek itself is a picture of New England charm with its quaint shops and leafy streets, Van Derlyn Manor represents a different breed of wealth - opulent, intimidating, and deeply rooted in tradition.
