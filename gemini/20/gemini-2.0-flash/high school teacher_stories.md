The scent of stale coffee and desperation clung to Mr. Thomas Ashton like a cheap cologne. 6:15 AM. He was the first one in the building, as usual, his echoing footsteps a lonely counterpoint to the rhythmic hum of the fluorescent lights already buzzing to life in the hallway. He unlocked his classroom, room 212, a space that, at this hour, felt more like a mausoleum than a learning environment.

The room itself was a testament to a thousand half-hearted attempts at making high school English engaging. Posters of Shakespeare stared down with a knowing pity from the faded blue walls. A whiteboard, permanently stained with the ghosts of complex equations (left over from the previous math teacher, who fled to a higher paying job at the local community college), dominated the front. Rows of battered desks, each bearing the scars of countless bored students, sat in regimented lines, waiting to be filled with the restless energy of teenage angst. The back wall, a sad imitation of a library, was lined with dog-eared paperbacks donated by parents clearing out their attics: Dickens, Austen, and, for some reason, a disturbingly large collection of romance novels with Fabio on the cover. He'd tried to add some life with a small, struggling fern on his desk, but it mostly served as a reminder of his own slow, green-tinged decay. Thomas Ashton, 38, English teacher at Northwood High, sighed, set down his thermos, and braced himself for another day in the trenches.
