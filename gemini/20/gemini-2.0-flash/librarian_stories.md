**Setting:** The Grand Haven Historical Archive and Library, nestled on the shores of Lake Michigan in Grand Haven, Michigan. The building itself was a Victorian behemoth, all stained glass, creaking floorboards, and the faint scent of old paper and brine from the nearby lake. Towering oak shelves, laden with leather-bound volumes and fragile documents, stretched towards the high, coffered ceiling. Dust motes danced in the shafts of sunlight that pierced through the arched windows, illuminating the hushed, reverent atmosphere. Outside, the relentless roar of the lake provided a constant, almost meditative, soundtrack to the library's quietude. Today, however, the roar was particularly ferocious, a storm raging just beyond the library's thick stone walls, threatening to engulf everything in its path.

**Opening:**

Eleanor Ainsworth Prescott adjusted her spectacles, the storm outside mirroring the tempest brewing in her stomach. The flickering gas lamps cast long, dancing shadows across the circulation desk, momentarily obscuring the neat stacks of overdue notices and the meticulously organized sign-out slips. Thunder rumbled, vibrating through the building's foundations, and Eleanor instinctively reached for her steaming mug of Earl Grey tea. The chipped floral pattern offered a small comfort. Another Tuesday, another storm, another day spent safeguarding the history of Grand Haven. But today, the air felt different, heavier somehow, laden with a sense of foreboding that settled deep in her bones. It wasn't just the weather. It was the insistent, nagging feeling that something, or someone, was about to disrupt the tranquility of her beloved archive.
