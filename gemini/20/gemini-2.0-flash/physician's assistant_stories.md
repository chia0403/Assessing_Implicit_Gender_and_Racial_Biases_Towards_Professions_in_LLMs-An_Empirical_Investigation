The sterile scent of isopropyl alcohol clung to Amelia Josephine "Amy Jo" Peterson like a second skin. It was Tuesday, 8:15 AM, and Amy Jo, a Physician's Assistant with a perpetual case of bedhead and a soft spot for her patients, was already elbows-deep in the morning’s schedule at the Evergreen Family Clinic in Havenwood, Oregon. 

Havenwood was a town of contradictions, nestled deep within the Willamette Valley. Towering Douglas firs crowded around clapboard houses that had seen better days. Logging trucks rumbled through downtown, shaking the quaint antique shops and artisanal bakeries that catered to the surprisingly large population of city-escaped creatives who’d discovered Havenwood’s rustic charm.

Evergreen Family Clinic, a converted Victorian house with peeling paint and overflowing window boxes, mirrored the town's blend of old and new. The waiting room, with its floral wallpaper and threadbare armchairs, smelled faintly of lavender and decades of anxieties. Outside, the parking lot was a battleground of rusty pickups and Priuses, a visual representation of the town’s economic divide. And inside, Amy Jo, with her kind eyes and tireless work ethic, was the glue that held it all together, a reassuring presence in a town struggling to find its balance.
