## Opening:

The first hint of rain was a pinprick, a single, icy kiss on Arthur Reginald Finch's cheek. He didn't even bother looking up. He could smell it. The metallic tang of ozone clinging to the humid air, the subtle shift in the wind that ruffled the loose shingles at his feet – Arthur knew rain better than he knew his own wife's face.

He swore under his breath, a low grumble lost in the rumble of a distant truck. Six more rows of shingles. Six more rows and he'd be able to call it a day, secure the exposed underlayment, and head home to a lukewarm dinner and a televised ballgame. But the sky, that fickle, indifferent canvas above, was darkening with the ominous speed of a bruise blooming. He could almost feel the electricity crackling in the air.

"Bugger," he muttered again, hefting another armful of asphalt shingles. "This job ain't worth getting fried for."

## Setting:

The year is 1978, and Arthur Reginald Finch is balanced precariously on the steeply pitched roof of the Good Shepherd Lutheran Church, located in the small, blue-collar town of Harmony Creek, Ohio. Harmony Creek is a town clinging to the edges of prosperity, a place where the factory whistles still blow at dawn, and Friday night football is a sacred ritual.

The church itself is a solid, brick structure, built in the traditional gothic style, with a towering steeple that Arthur has always found vaguely intimidating. Around it sprawl tidy, though slightly faded, houses, each with a meticulously manicured lawn and a flagpole proudly displaying the American flag. The air is thick with the scent of freshly cut grass, blooming honeysuckle, and the ever-present, acrid tang of the nearby steel mill. The sun, when it dares to peek through the gathering storm clouds, reflects off the windows of the houses, glinting like fool's gold.

The roof is covered in old, crumbling asphalt shingles, a patchwork of faded grays and browns. The air is baking hot, despite the gathering storm, radiating off the sun-baked material. Tools are scattered around Arthur’s work area – a hammer worn smooth with use, a utility knife with a chipped blade, a chalk line reel caked in dust. And clinging precariously to the gutters, a small, persistent robin chirps a nervous warning, mirroring the nagging feeling in Arthur's own gut.
