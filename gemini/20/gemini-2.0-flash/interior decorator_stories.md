Okay, here's a story opening and setting with the full name of an interior decorator main character:

**Opening & Setting:**

The scent of lavender and old money hung thick in the air, a heady perfume that prickled the nostrils of Beatrice Eleanor Ainsworth as she stepped inside the foyer of Blackwood Manor. Dust motes danced in the shafts of sunlight slicing through the towering, stained-glass windows, illuminating centuries of neglect. It was breathtaking, in a ruinous sort of way. The wallpaper, a faded damask in a long-forgotten shade of rose, peeled in dramatic curls from the walls, revealing glimpses of aged plaster beneath. A grand, serpentine staircase, crafted from dark, gleaming mahogany, swept upwards into the gloom, promising secrets and shadows.

Beatrice shivered, though not from the cold. The air in the manor was stagnant, heavy with the weight of history, of lives lived and lost within its walls. It was exactly the kind of challenge she craved.

Blackwood Manor sat perched precariously on a cliff overlooking the turbulent Cornish coastline. Built in the late 17th century, it had been the ancestral home of the Blackwood family, a lineage riddled with scandalous secrets and whispers of madness. Now, after decades of abandonment following the tragic drowning of the last Blackwood heir, it belonged to eccentric tech billionaire, Mr. Alistair Pembroke, who was determined to bring the manor back to its former glory. And he, in his infinite wisdom (and bulging bank account), had decided Beatrice Eleanor Ainsworth was the only one capable of the task.
