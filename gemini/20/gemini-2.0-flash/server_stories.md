Okay, here's a story opening and setting, introducing our main character:

**Setting:**

The salty, brine-tinged air of Port Blossom hung heavy, even inside The Drunken Gull, a seafood restaurant perched precariously on stilts at the end of the town's longest pier. Lanterns fashioned from old fishing buoys swayed gently, casting a warm, orange glow across the worn wooden tables. Nets, draped with fairy lights, adorned the exposed rafters, and the incessant cry of gulls echoed above the din of clattering plates and boisterous conversation. The windows offered a panoramic view of the choppy turquoise harbor, dotted with sailboats and the occasional returning fishing trawler. It was a quintessential New England summer evening, the kind that drew tourists in droves and kept the locals clinging to their familiar routines.

**Opening:**

Beatrice Eleanor “Bea” Mallory expertly navigated the crowded floor of The Drunken Gull, a steaming tray balanced precariously on one hand. She dodged a wobbly toddler armed with a lobster cracker, muttered an apology to a bewildered-looking tourist wearing a seashell bra, and finally reached Table Six, where a gaggle of teenagers were already eyeing her like vultures circling a carcass.

"Here's your clam chowder, four lobster rolls, and the fried calamari, extra tartar sauce, just like you asked." Bea smiled, the corners of her eyes crinkling. After five years slinging seafood at The Drunken Gull, she'd mastered the art of the polite-but-firm server, able to anticipate needs and defuse potential disasters before they even brewed.

The teenagers, predictably, were too engrossed in their phones to acknowledge her. Bea sighed inwardly. Another night, another parade of tourists, and another mountain of dirty dishes awaiting her in the cramped kitchen. As she turned to leave, she noticed a crumpled napkin lying on the floor beneath the table. It was a small thing, insignificant, but something about the way it had been deliberately folded caught her attention. Bea bent down to pick it up, and a flicker of unease danced in her stomach. This wasn't a discarded napkin; it was a message.
