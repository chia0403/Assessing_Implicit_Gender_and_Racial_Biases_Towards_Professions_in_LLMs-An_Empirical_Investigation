## Opening:

The salt-laced wind whipped Eleanor "Nell" Ashworth's hair across her face, stinging her cheeks raw. She squinted, the harsh afternoon light reflecting off the churning slate-grey sea, and gripped her easel tighter.  The canvas, only minimally sketched with the nascent form of a fishing trawler battling the waves, threatened to become airborne.  Frustration, a familiar companion these days, gnawed at her. The light was fading faster than she could capture it, and the raw, untamed beauty of this coastline seemed determined to resist her every attempt to tame it with her brush.

## Setting:

Nell was perched precariously on a rocky outcrop overlooking the jagged coastline of the Isle of Skye, in the Scottish Highlands.  Specifically, she was a few miles north of the charming, but often windswept, village of Portree. Behind her, the towering, heather-covered Cuillin mountains loomed, their peaks shrouded in a perpetual misty veil.  The air was thick with the scent of peat and salt, a wild, untamed aroma that both invigorated and intimidated her.  The small, weather-beaten cottage she was renting for the summer, a mile inland, was a simple refuge from the relentless elements. It had a single window overlooking this very view, a view she hoped to master before the first frosts arrived, forcing her back to the stifling predictability of her London studio.
