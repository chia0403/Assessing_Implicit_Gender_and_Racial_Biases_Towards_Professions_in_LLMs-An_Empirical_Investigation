## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Mildred Abigail Plum's daily life. She sighed, pushing her oversized, purple-rimmed glasses further up her nose. Outside, the Chicago wind howled, threatening to tear the perpetually damp leaves off the skeletal trees that lined Michigan Avenue. Inside, the pristine, minimalist lobby of "Zenith Global Investments" felt sterile and detached, a far cry from the cozy, book-filled apartment Mildred dreamt of retreating to each evening.

Just then, the heavy glass doors whooshed open, letting in a gust of frigid air and a man who looked as though he'd just stepped out of a noir film. He wore a fedora pulled low over his eyes, and a long, charcoal grey coat that billowed around him. He hadn't yet taken a step into the lobby, but Mildred already knew this wasn't just another delivery guy or lost tourist. This was going to be one of *those* days.

## Setting:

**Location:** The minimalist, ultra-modern lobby of Zenith Global Investments, a high-rise office building located on Michigan Avenue in Chicago.

**Time of Year:** Late Autumn, early November.

**Atmosphere:** Sterile, corporate, and slightly intimidating. Think chrome, glass, and perfectly manicured, albeit artificial, greenery. The lighting is bright and unwavering, offering little warmth. The only sounds are the hum of the fluorescent lights, the low murmur of the ventilation system, and the occasional click-clack of heels on the polished marble floor. The outside world feels distant and muffled, shut off by the soundproof glass.
