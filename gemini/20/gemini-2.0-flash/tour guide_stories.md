The salt spray stung Amelia Rose Hawthorne's face as she wrestled the brim of her wide-brimmed straw hat. Another rogue gust of wind threatened to fling it into the churning grey waters of the Bay of Fundy, waters infamous for boasting the highest tides in the world. Around her, the ten tourists on her "Hopewell Rocks Sunrise Spectacle" tour were shivering, a motley crew of bundled-up souls from places as far flung as Germany and Arizona. They huddled against the jagged red cliffs, a few clutching lukewarm coffees from the little cafe in the village of Alma, their faces illuminated by the pre-dawn glow.

Amelia, despite the biting chill and the constant battle with her hat, felt a thrill course through her. This was her stage. This was her passion. She loved explaining the geological marvel that surrounded them, these iconic "flowerpot rocks" sculpted by millennia of tidal erosion.

The setting was precisely 5:17 AM on a particularly blustery morning in early June. The location was the viewing platform at Hopewell Rocks Provincial Park, New Brunswick, Canada, overlooking the famous formations just as the sun began to paint the horizon in hues of pale pink and bruised purple. The air smelled of brine, wet earth, and the faint, musty odor of seaweed clinging to the exposed rock face. Beyond the immediate vista of the receding tide, the vast, shimmering bay stretched towards the horizon, a restless expanse of silver-grey under the burgeoning dawn. The silence, broken only by the mournful cries of gulls and the rhythmic crash of distant waves, held a power that both intimidated and inspired Amelia. This place was ancient, and she, Amelia Rose Hawthorne, was its humble interpreter.
