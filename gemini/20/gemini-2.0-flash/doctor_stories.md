The salt spray stung Dr. Eleanor Marguerite Ainsworth’s face as she clung to the railing of the research vessel, the *Sea Serpent*. The pre-dawn light, barely a sliver of pearly grey on the horizon, did little to illuminate the churning, obsidian waters surrounding them. The *Sea Serpent*, a converted fishing trawler laden with scientific equipment and the scent of old diesel, bucked and rolled mercilessly. Eleanor braced herself against the pitching deck, the rhythmic thrum of the engines a familiar, almost comforting, hum beneath the howling wind.

They were deep in the Drake Passage, a notoriously volatile stretch of ocean separating South America from Antarctica. Eleanor had imagined the passage as pristine, an untouched expanse of shimmering ice and stoic penguins. Instead, it was a maelstrom, a primal force wrestling with the very fabric of the planet. The air was frigid, a damp cold that seeped into your bones and settled there, a constant, unwelcome guest.

The ship, the crew, the relentless chill – all paled in comparison to the anxiety twisting in Eleanor’s gut. For weeks, they had been tracking a peculiar signal emanating from beneath the ice, a faint, almost imperceptible anomaly that had sent ripples of excitement through the scientific community back at the University of Cambridge. Eleanor, a specialist in extremophile biology with a side specialty in marine medicine, had been handpicked for the expedition, a position she'd both dreamed of and now deeply regretted. The signal, they believed, indicated the presence of something *alive*, something thriving in a place where nothing should. And Eleanor, with her medical expertise, would be the one to examine it. The thought both thrilled and terrified her.
