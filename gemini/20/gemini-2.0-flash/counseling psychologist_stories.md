## Story Opening & Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The scent of stale coffee and lilies hung heavy in the air, a cloying combination that always grated on Dr. Eleanor Vance's nerves. She pinched the bridge of her nose, trying to ward off the headache that threatened to bloom behind her eyes. Outside, the relentless Seattle rain hammered against the windows, mirroring the tempest brewing within her own mind.  Today was Friday. Friday meant group therapy. And group therapy, lately, meant navigating a minefield of raw emotions and barely-concealed resentments.  Eleanor straightened the meticulously aligned pens on her desk, a futile attempt to impose order on a world that felt increasingly chaotic.  She glanced at the clock – 9:58 AM.  Two minutes.  Two minutes until the carousel of pain and longing began again.  Two minutes until she had to become, once again, the anchor in someone else’s storm.  But today, the storm felt dangerously close to engulfing her, too.
 
**Setting:**

Dr. Eleanor Vance's office is located on the second floor of a renovated Victorian house in the Fremont neighborhood of Seattle.  The house, painted a cheerful, albeit somewhat faded, robin's egg blue, houses several small practices - a massage therapist, an acupuncturist, and a small law firm specializing in family law.  Eleanor's office itself is designed to be calming and inviting, although the reality often falls short of the ideal.  A plush, worn, Persian rug covers the hardwood floor, its vibrant colours muted by years of foot traffic.  Two overstuffed armchairs flank a low, round coffee table littered with tissues and half-empty mugs.  A large, framed print of a Klimt landscape hangs on one wall, providing a splash of colour, while the other walls are painted a soothing, neutral beige. A bookshelf crammed with psychology textbooks, self-help guides, and the occasional novel leans precariously against the back wall. The window, currently streaked with rain, offers a partial view of the Fremont Troll lurking beneath the Aurora Bridge, a silent, watchful guardian.  Despite Eleanor's best efforts to create a sanctuary, the space often feels cramped and overwhelmed by the weight of the stories it holds.
