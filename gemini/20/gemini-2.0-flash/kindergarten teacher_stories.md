The fluorescent lights of Mrs. Eleanor Marguerite Hawthorne's kindergarten classroom hummed a familiar, slightly irritating tune. It was 7:45 AM, a time Eleanor affectionately referred to as "The Calm Before the Crayon Storm." Sunlight streamed through the large, child-decorated windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and casting a warm glow on the alphabet rug sprawled across the center of the room.

Outside, the crisp autumn air nipped at the rust-colored leaves falling from the ancient oak trees that lined the perimeter of Little Acorn Elementary School in Willow Creek, Ohio. Inside, Eleanorâ€™s classroom was a kaleidoscope of primary colors: red tables dotted with tiny, mis-matched chairs, blue cubbies overflowing with backpacks and artwork, and yellow construction paper snowflakes clinging precariously to the ceiling from last winter's craft project.

Eleanor, a woman whose smile lines crinkled deeper with each passing year and whose kind eyes held a universe of patience, surveyed her domain. She adjusted the slightly crooked "Welcome to Kindergarten!" banner, ensuring the hand-drawn illustrations of pumpkins and apples were facing the right way. With a contented sigh and a quick sip of her lukewarm coffee, Eleanor Marguerite Hawthorne braced herself for the arrival of twenty-two miniature humans, each bringing their own unique brand of chaos, curiosity, and boundless energy into her perfectly imperfect world. Today, she had a feeling, would be a day unlike any other.
