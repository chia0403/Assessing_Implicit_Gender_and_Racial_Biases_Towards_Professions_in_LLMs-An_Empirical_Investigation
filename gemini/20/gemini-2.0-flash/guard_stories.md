The biting wind, laced with the scent of pine and coming straight off the snow-capped peaks of the Dragon's Teeth mountains, nipped at Sergeant Elias Thorne's exposed cheeks. He shifted his weight on the frosted cobblestones, pulling the thick wool collar of his Warden uniform tighter around his neck. The pre-dawn chill always burrowed deep into his bones, no matter how many layers he wore.

He was stationed at the East Gate of Aeridor, the capital city of Eldoria, and the silence before the dawn rush was a lonely thing. Two imposing granite towers, capped with emerald green copper roofs, flanked the heavy oaken gates. Intricate carvings of ancient kings and mythical creatures adorned the stone, remnants of a forgotten age of Elven artistry. The gates themselves were reinforced with iron bands, a stark reminder that even within the supposed safety of Aeridor's walls, vigilance was paramount.

The faint glow of alchemical street lamps cast long, distorted shadows across the square outside the gate, illuminating the drifts of freshly fallen snow. Not a soul stirred, save for the occasional scavenging rat disappearing into the gloom. It was Elias's duty to ensure that nothing else did either, not before the city was properly awake. He was a guardian, a protector, a shield against the shadows that always seemed to be lurking just beyond the light.
