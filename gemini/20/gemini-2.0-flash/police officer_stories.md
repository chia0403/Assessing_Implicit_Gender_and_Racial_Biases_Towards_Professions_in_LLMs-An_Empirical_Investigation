The November air bit at Detective Isabella “Izzy” Rossi’s exposed skin as she surveyed the scene. Rain, a relentless, needle-like drizzle, plastered her dark hair to her forehead and threatened to seep into her perpetually ink-stained notepad. The streetlights, flickering weakly against the oppressive gray sky, did little to illuminate the alleyway behind O’Malley’s Irish Pub on Bleecker Street.

This wasn’t just any alley. This was the notorious “Whisper Alley,” a haven for hushed deals, furtive meetings, and, more often than not, discarded bodies. It was a labyrinth of overflowing dumpsters, stray cats that dared to glare back at Izzy, and the pervasive aroma of stale beer and desperation. Tonight, the desperation had curdled into something far more sinister.

A chalk outline marked the spot where a young woman, barely out of her teens, had been discovered just an hour ago. Her face, what Izzy could see of it beneath the medical examiner’s sheet, was frozen in a mask of terror. Izzy hated these cases. The young, the vulnerable, the victims swallowed whole by the city's dark underbelly. They always stuck with her, a jagged edge in her gut that no amount of cheap coffee or late-night paperwork could smooth over.
