The Honorable Seraphina Beatrice Moreau tapped a chipped crimson nail against the mahogany desk, the rhythmic clicks echoing in the cavernous silence of her chambers. Rain lashed against the arched windows, a relentless drumming that mirrored the unease churning in her stomach. Outside, the gas lamps of New Birmingham flickered feebly against the encroaching gloom, casting long, skeletal shadows across the cobbled streets below. It was late – well past midnight – and the city, usually a cacophony of gears grinding and steam hissing, was hushed, holding its breath against the coming storm. Judge Moreau, however, was far from sleep.  A single document lay open before her, illuminated by the warm glow of a brass oil lamp, its contents threatening to unravel the fragile peace that had settled upon the city after years of conflict.  It was a warrant for the arrest of Elias Thorne, the man who, not so long ago, had been hailed as the city's savior.
