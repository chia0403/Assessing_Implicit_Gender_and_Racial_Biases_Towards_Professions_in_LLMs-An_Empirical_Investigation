The stale recirculated air hung heavy with the faint scent of airplane coffee and something vaguely floral, likely emanating from Beatrice "Bea" Moreau's own perfume.  Outside, the sun beat down on the tarmac of the Toussaint Louverture International Airport in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Bea, her crisp navy blue uniform clinging uncomfortably in the humidity, smoothed a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. Flight 417 to Miami was delayed, again, and the restless passengers crammed into the Boeing 737 were beginning to fray at the edges. A baby wailed from the back, a businessman barked into his phone about missed connections, and the teenage girl in seat 23B kept sighing dramatically loud enough for Bea to hear every exasperated breath. It was going to be a long day.
