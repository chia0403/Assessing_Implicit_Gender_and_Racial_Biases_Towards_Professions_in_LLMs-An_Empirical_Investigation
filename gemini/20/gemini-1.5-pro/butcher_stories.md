The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, carrying the scent of salt and something faintly metallic.  It clawed at the thick canvas awning of "Finnegan's Fine Meats," rattling the hanging carcasses of lamb and beef that swayed like morbid marionettes.  Inside, the shop was a haven of warmth, radiating the deep, earthy aroma of sawdust and aging meat.  Jasper Alistair Finch, his apron smeared crimson and his hands chapped despite the warmth, honed his cleaver with a rhythmic scrape against the steel. The blade gleamed under the single bare bulb hanging above the butcher block, sharp enough to split a hair, just as his father, and his father before him, had taught him.  Saltburn-by-the-Sea, a small Yorkshire town clinging to the cliffs, was a place of hard lives and simple pleasures, and Jasper, like the generations of Finches before him, was at its heart, providing sustenance and a bit of grimly cheerful conversation.
