The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, stinging Amelia “Mia” Thorne’s cheeks as she adjusted the tripod on the shingle beach.  Salt spray kissed her lens, a constant battle she’d long grown used to.  Grey clouds, heavy with the promise of rain, scudded low across the sky, casting the small fishing village of Port Blossom, nestled between two craggy cliffs on the Yorkshire coast, in a perpetual twilight.  Fishing boats, bobbing gently in the harbour, clanged against each other, their rhythmic percussion a soundtrack to Mia’s solitude.  This was her favourite time of day, the hour before dawn, when the world held its breath, waiting for the sun to break through.  It was in these stolen moments of quiet anticipation that Mia felt most alive, her camera an extension of her own searching gaze, capturing the ephemeral beauty of a world on the cusp of waking.
