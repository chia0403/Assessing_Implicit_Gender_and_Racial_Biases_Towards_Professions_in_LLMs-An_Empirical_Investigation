The rusty aroma of brake dust and old engine oil clung to Elara “Ellie” Vasquez like a second skin.  It wasn't a perfume, not exactly, but it was familiar, comforting even.  Her garage, "Ellie's Auto," nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed-down bowling alley on the outskirts of Dustbowl, Nevada, was her sanctuary.  The desert sun beat down on the corrugated iron roof, radiating heat that mixed with the already stifling air inside.  A lone, flickering fluorescent light buzzed overhead, casting long shadows across the grease-stained concrete floor.  A vintage Chevy Impala, its sky-blue paint faded and peeling, sat up on blocks, its guts spilled out across a sheet of well-worn canvas.  Ellie, her dark hair pulled back in a messy bun, wiped a bead of sweat from her brow with the back of her greasy hand and squinted at the Impala’s carburetor.  This wasn’t just any repair; this was a resurrection.
