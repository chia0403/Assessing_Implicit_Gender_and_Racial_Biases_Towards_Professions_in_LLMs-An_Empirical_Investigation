The rain hammered against the corrugated metal roof of the clinic, a relentless rhythm that mirrored the throbbing pain in Dr. Eleanor Vance’s lower back.  The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of eucalyptus and damp earth, a familiar aroma that clung to everything in the small coastal town of Port Blossom, Oregon. Eleanor, her name tag slightly askew on her crisp white coat,  shifted her weight from one foot to the other, trying to find a position that didn’t aggravate her recent bout of sciatica. The waiting room of "Mend & Motion Physical Therapy," usually bustling with patients nursing everything from tennis elbow to post-surgical stiffness, was eerily empty.  Only the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock in the corner punctuated the downpour's drumming.  A storm of a different kind, Eleanor sensed, was brewing.  She had a feeling the quiet wouldn’t last.
