The scent of burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the usual buttercream-and-rose perfume that permeated Seraphina "Sera" Dubois' cake studio.  Sera, her brow furrowed in concentration, stared at the smoking monstrosity in her oven. It was supposed to be a magnificent croquembouche, a towering cone of profiteroles drizzled with spun sugar, commissioned for the Mayor's Diamond Jubilee. Instead, it resembled a caramelized volcanic eruption.  Outside, the Parisian dawn painted the sky in hues of apricot and lavender, filtering through the large windows of "Le Gateau Magique," nestled on a quaint cobblestone street just off the bustling Rue de Rivoli.  The rhythmic clatter of a street sweeper echoed in the otherwise silent morning, a counterpoint to the frantic thumping of Sera's heart.  This was a disaster. A sugary, sticky, career-ending disaster.
