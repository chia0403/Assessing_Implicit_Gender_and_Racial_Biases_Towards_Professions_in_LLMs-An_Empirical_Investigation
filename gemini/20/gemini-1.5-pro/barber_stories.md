The rusty scissors, nestled in Elias Thorne's calloused hand, snicked rhythmically against the comb's teeth. Outside Thorne's Tonsorial Parlour, the wind whipped through the narrow, cobbled streets of Port Blossom, a small, salt-laced town clinging to the edge of the Whisperwind Coast.  Rain lashed against the single, grime-streaked window, blurring the view of the restless grey sea beyond.  The parlour itself was warm, almost stiflingly so, the air thick with the mingled scents of bay rum, pipe tobacco, and the faintly metallic tang of freshly cut hair.  A single gas lamp hissed overhead, casting flickering shadows that danced across the faded floral wallpaper and the worn leather of the barber chair. Elias, a man of few words and even fewer smiles, meticulously sculpted the sideburns of a dozing fisherman, his movements precise and practiced, honed by years of tending to the hirsute needs of Port Blossom's inhabitants. He was a fixture in the town, as much a part of its landscape as the craggy cliffs and the ever-present sea mist. But tonight, something felt different.  A prickling unease settled on him, a feeling as sharp and cold as the wind howling outside.
