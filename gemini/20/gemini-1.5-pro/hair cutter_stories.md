The rusty scissors, affectionately nicknamed "Snippy" by Elias Thorne, whispered through a thick hank of ginger hair. Elias, a man whose own salt-and-pepper locks curled like iron filings around a magnet, hummed along to the scratchy jazz record spinning on the turntable. His barbershop, "Thorne's Tonsorial Treasures," nestled between a dusty antique shop and a perpetually bustling bakery in the heart of Alder’s Bend, Oregon, exuded an aroma of bay rum, sandalwood, and faint, sweet vanilla – a testament to Mrs. Olsen’s next-door baking prowess. Rain lashed against the large front window, obscuring the view of the normally vibrant main street, transforming it into a blurry Impressionist painting.  The bell above the door chimed, announcing a new arrival, and Elias paused mid-snip, his eyes, the colour of warm honey, glancing towards the entrance. The rhythmic drumming of the rain was punctuated by the squeak of the opening door.
