The fluorescent lights of Bartholomew "Barty" Higgins' office hummed a monotonous B-flat, a soundtrack perfectly suited to the grey drizzle blurring the windows overlooking downtown Akron, Ohio. Barty, a man whose neatly parted hair and pressed suit belied a deep-seated yearning for adventure novels and tropical beaches, tapped a chewed-down pen against his overflowing inbox. It was a Thursday in late November, the kind of day that clung to you like damp wool, leeching the warmth from your bones and replacing it with a vague sense of existential dread. Outside, the skeletal branches of a sycamore tree clawed at the sky, mirroring the way Barty’s own anxieties scratched at the edges of his carefully constructed composure.  He was, after all, about to meet a new client, a Mrs. Agatha Grimshaw, who had a reputation for being…eccentric.  And in Barty’s line of work, “eccentric” rarely translated into a straightforward life insurance policy.
