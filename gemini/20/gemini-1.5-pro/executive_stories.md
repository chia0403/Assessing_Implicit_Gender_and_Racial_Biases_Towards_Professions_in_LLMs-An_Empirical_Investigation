Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Cassandra "Cassie" Moreau's forty-second-floor office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her. The jagged peaks of the Manhattan skyline, normally a source of exhilaration, were obscured by a grey, swirling mist.  Below, the yellow cabs weaving through the gridlocked streets of Midtown looked like tiny, frantic beetles. Inside the sleek, minimalist space, the only sound apart from the drumming rain was the rhythmic tick-tock of a vintage Herm√®s clock, a gift from her recently deceased father.  It was 7:15 pm on a Thursday, a time Cassie usually reserved for a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon overlooking Central Park, but tonight, the crystalline liquid sloshing in her glass was straight Scotch, and the view was anything but calming.  The deal of her life, the one that would cement her position as CEO of Moreau Industries, was on the verge of collapse, and the weight of her family's legacy pressed down on her like the storm clouds gathering outside.
