The frosted glass of Amelia Pearl Holloway's office door rattled with the persistent November wind that howled down Elm Street, carrying with it the scent of woodsmoke and decaying leaves.  Her office, nestled above Mrs. O’Malley’s perpetually fragrant bakery, was a haven of quiet order in the otherwise bustling small town of Oakhaven, Vermont.  Ledgers lined the shelves, each spine meticulously labelled and dated.  A chipped porcelain teacup, perpetually filled with Earl Grey, sat beside a brass abacus on her oak desk, its surface gleaming under the warm glow of a banker’s lamp.  Outside, the first fat snowflakes of the season began to fall, obscuring the view of the town square’s gazebo, where the annual Christmas tree lighting ceremony was scheduled to take place in just three weeks.  Amelia, however, remained oblivious to the festive preparations stirring below.  Her brow furrowed in concentration, she meticulously tallied the debits and credits for the Oakhaven General Store, a faint pencil scratch the only sound in the otherwise silent room.  It was then, a sharp rap at the door interrupting the rhythmic click of the abacus beads, that her otherwise ordinary Tuesday took a decidedly unexpected turn.
