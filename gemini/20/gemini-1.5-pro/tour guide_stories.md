The biting wind whipped Amelia “Amy” Hawthorne’s braid across her face as she surveyed the desolate beauty of the Icelandic highlands.  Around her, a panorama of ochre and grey stretched to the horizon, broken only by the jagged peaks of dormant volcanoes and the occasional glimmer of a glacial river.  It was late September, and the first snowfall of the season had dusted the landscape, painting the volcanic rock in swirling patterns of white and black.  Amy, bundled in a thick parka and waterproof trousers, stamped her feet to ward off the chill and checked her watch.  Her tour group, a motley collection of eight adventurers, was due to arrive any minute at the designated meeting point – a lonely petrol station and convenience store that served as the last outpost of civilization before venturing into the vast emptiness of the Fimmvorðuháls mountain pass.  The air hummed with a strange energy, a mixture of anticipation and the almost palpable silence of the wilderness.  Amy took a deep breath, inhaling the crisp, glacial air, and a small smile played on her lips. This was her element, her kingdom – a land of fire and ice, where she felt most alive.
