The bell above the door to "Nailed It," a small but stylish nail salon tucked between a laundromat and a perpetually closed Italian restaurant, jingled merrily.  Rain lashed against the window, blurring the neon glow of the "Open" sign.  Inside, the air was thick with the scent of acetone and something faintly floral, likely the jasmine-infused hand lotion Amelia Rose Hernandez favored. Amelia, a woman whose own nails were always impeccably manicured in a rotating kaleidoscope of colors and designs, glanced up from the intricate, hand-painted roses she was applying to Mrs. Petrovâ€™s acrylics.  Greyhaven, Oregon, was a town that embraced grey skies and drizzly afternoons, and on days like this, Nailed It was often its brightest spot.  But something about the way the wind howled outside, rattling the windowpanes, hinted that this particular grey afternoon might bring more than just a steady stream of clients seeking a pop of color in the gloom.
