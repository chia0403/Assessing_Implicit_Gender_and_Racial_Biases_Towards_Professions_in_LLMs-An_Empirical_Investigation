The revolving doors of the Grand Majestic Hotel whirred like a confused hummingbird, spitting out a gust of frigid Chicago air that smelled of exhaust and wet concrete. Inside, the lobby was a gilded cage, warmed by a crackling fireplace that did little to thaw the perpetual chill that seemed to emanate from Mr. Henderson, the hotel manager.  Elias Finch, a bellhop of slight build and perpetually worried brow, straightened his crimson uniform and shifted the weight of a heavy suitcase from one hand to the other.  It was December 23rd, 1938, and the hotel, usually a bastion of quiet elegance, buzzed with the frenetic energy of holiday travelers.  Tinsel garlands draped across the marble balconies, a towering Christmas tree glittered beneath the ornate chandelier, and the air hummed with the low murmur of conversations and the clinking of champagne flutes.  Elias, however, felt none of the festive cheer.  He knew from experience that the holidays brought out the worst in the Grand Majestic's clientele: demanding, entitled, and prone to leaving stingy tips.
