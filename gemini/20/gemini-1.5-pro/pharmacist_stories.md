The neon glow of "Apothecary & Owl," the only 24-hour pharmacy in the perpetually drizzly town of Port Blossom, cast an eerie green tinge across Dr. Elias Thorne's weary face. Rain lashed against the large, arched window, mimicking the throbbing headache that had taken root behind his right eye.  Port Blossom, nestled between the brooding cliffs of the Oregon coast and the dense, whispering evergreen forests, was usually a place of quiet charm. Tonight, however, the usual tranquility was replaced by a thick, unsettling atmosphere, almost as if the town itself was holding its breath.  At 3:17 am, the bell above the door chimed, its cheerful jingle jarring in the otherwise silent pharmacy. Elias, perched on a stool behind the counter, meticulously organizing expired vitamin bottles, looked up, expecting to see the usual insomniac or late-shift worker. Instead, he saw a woman he'd never seen before, her face obscured by the shadows of a wide-brimmed hat.
