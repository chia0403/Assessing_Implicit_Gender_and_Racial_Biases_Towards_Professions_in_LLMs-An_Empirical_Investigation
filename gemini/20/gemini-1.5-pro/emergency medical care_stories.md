The flickering neon sign of the 24-hour diner cast a sickly yellow glow across the rain-slicked asphalt.  Inside, Amelia “Amy” Rodriguez, a paramedic with Station 12, hunched over a lukewarm cup of coffee, the bitter taste mirroring the exhaustion clinging to her like a second skin. It was 3:17 AM in the perpetually sleep-deprived city of Alder Creek, nestled deep in the Cascade foothills. The incessant drumming of rain on the diner's corrugated metal roof was punctuated by the occasional rumble of thunder echoing through the narrow valley. The air hung heavy with the scent of pine needles and damp earth, a familiar perfume Amy usually found comforting, but tonight, it just added another layer to the oppressive stillness. Alder Creek was a town of contradictions: breathtaking natural beauty cloaking a simmering unease, a place where the tranquility could be shattered in an instant by the shrill cry of a siren, a cry Amy knew all too well. Tonight, the silence felt pregnant with anticipation, the calm before a storm she instinctively felt brewing.
