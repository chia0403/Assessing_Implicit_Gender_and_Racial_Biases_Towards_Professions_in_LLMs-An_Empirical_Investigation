Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Elias Thorne’s 42nd-floor office, the city lights blurring into a shimmering, impressionistic painting.  Elias, whose full name was Elias Vance Thorne III, tapped a manicured nail against the cool glass, the rhythmic click a stark contrast to the chaotic symphony of the storm outside. His tailored suit, a deep charcoal that mirrored the tempestuous sky, felt constricting. The air in the office, despite the humming purifier in the corner, was thick with the scent of impending doom – or perhaps it was just the overly-brewed coffee his perpetually frazzled assistant, Ms. Periwinkle, kept supplying. Below, the canyons of Wall Street, normally a buzzing hive of activity, were eerily deserted. It was October 28th, 2027, just two days before the anniversary of a market crash that had sent shockwaves through the global economy, and the air crackled with a nervous energy that Elias, a veteran of the trading floor, knew all too well.  This year, something felt different.  This year, the storm brewing outside felt like a pathetic imitation of the tempest gathering within the market itself.
