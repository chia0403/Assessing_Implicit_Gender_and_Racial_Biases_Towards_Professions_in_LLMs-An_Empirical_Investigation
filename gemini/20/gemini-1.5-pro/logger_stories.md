The biting wind whipped off Lake Superior, carrying the scent of pine and impending snow.  A scrim of ice already clung to the exposed metal of Silas Birch's Mack truck, reflecting the pre-dawn grey like a thousand tiny, fractured mirrors. Silas, whose full name was Silas Thaddeus Birch, sat in the cab, his breath fogging the air, a thermos of lukewarm coffee cradled in his calloused hands.  He watched the sky lighten above the dense, snow-dusted pines that carpeted the steep slopes of the Misquah Hills.  This was his domain, the raw, untamed wilderness of northern Minnesota, where the trees grew tall and the winters were long and unforgiving. This morning, however, felt different.  A strange stillness hung in the air, heavier than the usual pre-dawn quiet, and Silas felt a prickle of unease beneath his thick flannel shirt.  He chalked it up to the dropping temperature and the promise of snow, but the feeling lingered as he cranked the engine of his truck, the roar echoing in the stillness, and began the long, winding drive deeper into the woods towards his logging site.
