The wind, sharp and laced with the scent of pine needles, whipped around Eleanor Vance as she wrestled the "Open" sign onto the hook outside Serenity Now Massage Therapy.  Nestled amongst the quirky shops and art galleries of Cedarwood Cove, a small town tucked away in the Cascade foothills of Oregon, Serenity Now occupied a converted craftsman bungalow.  Its faded blue paint and wide, inviting porch hinted at a slower pace of life, a promise Eleanor clung to fiercely. Inside, the soft glow of Himalayan salt lamps battled the encroaching November gloom, casting warm light on the polished hardwood floors and the waiting area's plush, earth-toned furniture.  A kettle hissed gently on a hotplate, filling the air with the calming aroma of chamomile tea. Eleanor, her hands already aching from the cold, tucked a loose strand of her auburn hair behind her ear and hoped for a busy day.  The rent was due, and the promise of a quiet, fulfilling life in Cedarwood Cove was starting to feel a little less certain.
