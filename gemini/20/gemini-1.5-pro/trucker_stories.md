The neon "EAT" sign of the Dusty Rose Diner buzzed erratically, casting a sickly yellow glow across the rain-slicked asphalt of the I-90 truck stop.  Wind howled through the gaps in the peeling paint of the building, rattling the windows as Delilah “Dee” Jones wrestled her eighteen-wheeler, a hulking Kenworth W900 she’d christened "The Wanderer," into a parking spot.  The Wyoming night was a brutal, unforgiving expanse of black, punctuated only by the distant, flickering lights of Casper, some thirty miles west.  Inside the cab, Dee rubbed her tired eyes, the lines around them etched deep from years of squinting into sunrises and sunsets. She’d been on the road for five days straight, hauling a load of frozen peaches from California, and the promise of a hot cup of coffee and a greasy burger was the only thing keeping her from collapsing into the bunk behind her. This stretch of highway was notorious for its desolate beauty and its eerie quiet, a combination that usually soothed her.  But tonight, the wind felt less like a lullaby and more like a whispered warning.
