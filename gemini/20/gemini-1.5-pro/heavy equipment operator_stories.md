The biting pre-dawn chill sliced through Rosalia "Rosie" Vasquez's Carhartt jacket as she navigated the rutted dirt road leading to the quarry.  Dust, the color of dried blood, painted the sky a muted orange where the sun was just beginning to peek over the jagged peaks of the San Gabriel Mountains.  Rosie squinted, the beams catching the frosted breath curling from her lips. Below, nestled in the scarred earth like a gaping wound, lay the Vasquez Quarry.  It was a place of raw, brutal beauty, carved out of the mountainside generations ago by Rosie's ancestors. Today, she was the sole heir to this legacy of dust and dynamite, and the rumbling growl of a Caterpillar D10T dozer was her symphony.
