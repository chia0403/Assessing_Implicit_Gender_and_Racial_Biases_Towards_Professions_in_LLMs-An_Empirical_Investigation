The pungent aroma of perm solution hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume that clung to the floral wallpaper and vinyl chairs of "Curl Up & Dye." Rain lashed against the large front window, obscuring the view of Main Street, Harmony, Indiana.  Eliza June Thistlewick, her name as elaborate as the updos she crafted, sighed, wiping a stray strand of bleach-blonde hair from her forehead.  The clock above the reception desk ticked with agonizing slowness, marking the minutes until closing time on another dreary Tuesday.  The only sound louder than the rain was the rhythmic whir of the ancient hairdryer Mrs. Higgins insisted on using for her weekly set.  Eliza glanced over at the elderly woman, her head enveloped in a pink plastic bonnet, and offered a tight-lipped smile. Just one more hour, and she could finally lock up, kick off her uncomfortable, but stylish, heels, and collapse on her floral chintz sofa with a glass of cheap Merlot.  Little did Eliza know, this Tuesday was about to become anything but ordinary.
