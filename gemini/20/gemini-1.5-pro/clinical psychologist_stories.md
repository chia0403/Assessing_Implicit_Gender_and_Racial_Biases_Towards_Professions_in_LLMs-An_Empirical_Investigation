The rain hammered against the leaded windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance’s office, mimicking the persistent thrum of anxiety she felt in her own chest. Her mahogany desk, usually a beacon of order in a chaotic world, was cluttered with files – each one the fragile story of a fractured mind. Outside, the gothic spires of St. Jude’s Psychiatric Hospital, perched precariously on the windswept cliffs of the Cornish coast, were swallowed by a swirling grey mist. The salty tang of the sea air, usually a source of calm for Eleanor, tonight carried the unsettling premonition that something within those ancient walls, something beyond her usual roster of patients, was about to shift.  The cryptic phone call she'd received just an hour earlier from the hospital’s director, a man known for his unflappable demeanor, had left her with an unshakeable sense of foreboding. He'd simply said, "Eleanor, we have a situation.  And I think you're the only one who can help."
