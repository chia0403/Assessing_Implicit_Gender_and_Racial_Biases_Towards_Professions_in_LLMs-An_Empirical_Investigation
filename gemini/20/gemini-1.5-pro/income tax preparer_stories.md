The flickering fluorescent lights of Harold Finch's office cast a sickly yellow pallor over everything.  Dust motes danced in the anemic glow, illuminated like tiny, frantic insects trapped in amber.  Tax season was winding down, which meant Harold Finch, CPA, was finally able to breathe again.  His small office, tucked away in a strip mall between a laundromat and a perpetually closed-down video rental store in the sleepy town of Harmony Creek, Oregon, was usually a hive of activity from January to April.  Now, in the first week of May, it was blessedly quiet.  The stacks of receipts and 1099 forms that had threatened to bury him alive were finally tamed, filed neatly in their designated cabinets. The faint scent of stale coffee and desperation, which had permeated the air for months, was finally beginning to dissipate, replaced by the sweet, slightly chemical tang of the pine-scented air freshener Harold had optimistically plugged in that morning. He leaned back in his creaky chair, the sigh escaping his lips a mix of relief and exhaustion. This year's tax season had been particularly brutal, filled with more than the usual share of complicated returns and frantic last-minute filers.  He closed his eyes for a moment, savoring the quiet, when a sharp rap at the door shattered the peace.
