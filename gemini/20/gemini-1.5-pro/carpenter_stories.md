The rasping screech of saw against oak echoed through the crisp morning air, punctuated by the rhythmic thud of Elias Thorne's hammer.  Dust motes danced in the slanted sunlight that streamed through the open doorway of his workshop, illuminating the shavings curling off the heavy timber he was shaping into a lintel.  The workshop, nestled at the edge of the whispering Whispering Pines wood just outside the village of Oakhaven, was Elias's sanctuary.  It was a chaotic haven of wood shavings, half-finished projects, and the comforting scent of sawdust and varnish.  Outside, the world bustled with the concerns of villagers preparing for the annual Harvest Festival, but within these four walls, Elias found a quiet solitude broken only by the sounds of his craft. The air held a bite, a harbinger of the approaching winter, and a thin layer of frost dusted the fallen leaves outside.  This year, the festival held a special significance: the unveiling of the new town gates, crafted by Elias himself, a project he'd poured his heart and soul into for the past six months.
