The biting November wind whipped around Agnes Periwinkle, stinging her cheeks as she wrestled the heavy oak door of Eventide Manor closed.  Dead leaves, the colour of dried blood, skittered across the gravel drive.  Eventide, a sprawling Victorian mansion perched on the cliffs overlooking the churning grey North Sea, seemed to sigh in the wind, its many windows like vacant eyes staring out at the gathering storm.  Agnes, her grey hair escaping from beneath her worn woolen hat, tucked a stray strand behind her ear and trudged toward the back entrance.  She’d been housekeeper at Eventide for nearly twenty years, long enough to know the house’s every creak and groan, every secret passage and shadowed corner.  Long enough, too, to feel the oppressive weight of its loneliness, a loneliness that seemed to seep into her very bones, especially on days like this.
