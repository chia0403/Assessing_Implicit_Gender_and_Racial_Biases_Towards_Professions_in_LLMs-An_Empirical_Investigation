The insistent chirping of a lone cricket, somehow amplified within the confines of Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's tiny office, mirrored the persistent thrum of anxiety in her chest.  Dust motes danced in the anemic light filtering through the grimy window of "Hawthorne's Hideaways," a travel agency squeezed between a laundromat and a perpetually closed fortune teller's parlor on Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village.  The aroma of stale coffee and mothballs clung to the air, a testament to Amy's long hours and dwindling budget.  Outside, the oppressive July humidity hung heavy, plastering stray strands of Amy's auburn hair to her forehead.  The usually vibrant street scene, a cacophony of buskers, street vendors, and tourists, was subdued this afternoon, the energy sapped by the stifling heat. Amy stared at her computer screen, the blinking cursor mocking her lack of progress.  Bookings were down, bills were piling up, and her dream of transforming Hawthorne's Hideaways into a thriving business was beginning to feel as faded and brittle as the vintage travel posters adorning the walls.
