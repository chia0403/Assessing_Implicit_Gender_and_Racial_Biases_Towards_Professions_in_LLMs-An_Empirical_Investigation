The salt-laced wind whipped at the edges of  Elara Marisole Nightingale's canvas, threatening to tear it from the easel.  Perched precariously on a rocky outcrop overlooking the churning turquoise waters of the Aegean Sea, Elara ignored the biting gusts. Her focus was entirely absorbed by the scene before her: the whitewashed village of Oia clinging to the cliffs of Santorini, its blue-domed churches gleaming like jewels under the fierce midday sun.  A kaleidoscope of colours bloomed on her palette – cerulean, cobalt, a touch of cadmium yellow for the sun-baked walls – mirroring the vibrant landscape.  Her fingers, stained with streaks of ultramarine, danced across the canvas, capturing the essence of this breathtaking, volcanic island, a place she’d only dreamt of painting until now.  But even as her brushstrokes brought the scene to life, a strange unease settled in Elara's stomach, a prickling sensation that had nothing to do with the wind and everything to do with the abandoned church just behind her, its shadowed doorway gaping like a toothless maw.
