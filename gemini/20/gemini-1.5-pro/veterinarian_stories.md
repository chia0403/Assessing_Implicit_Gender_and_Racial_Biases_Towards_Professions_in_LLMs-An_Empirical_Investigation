The biting wind whipped around Dr. Eleanor Vance as she wrestled the heavy oak door of the Cedarwood Veterinary Clinic closed against the onslaught.  Snow, thick and relentless, swirled through the pines that lined the long, lonely driveway, obscuring the already fading light of a late December afternoon in the Adirondack Mountains.  Inside, the clinic was warm and smelled faintly of disinfectant and wet dog, a scent Eleanor found strangely comforting. Shadow, her aging black lab and constant companion, thumped his tail against the worn linoleum floor, nudging her hand with his wet nose as she shrugged off her snow-dusted parka. The radio, perched precariously on a stack of dog food bags, crackled with a local weather report predicting blizzard conditions overnight. Eleanor sighed, the prospect of being snowed in at the clinic, miles from the nearest town, not entirely unwelcome.
