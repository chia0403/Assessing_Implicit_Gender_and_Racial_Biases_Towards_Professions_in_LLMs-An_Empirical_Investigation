The humid Miami air hung thick and heavy, even at 6:00 AM.  Dew clung to the vibrant bougainvillea that tumbled over the wrought-iron fence surrounding the Art Deco courtyard of the Solara Luxury Apartments.  A rhythmic thump-thump-thump echoed from within, growing louder as Brianna "Bree"  Rodriguez, clad in neon pink leggings and a matching sports bra, adjusted the microphone clipped to her ear.  Sweat already beaded on her forehead, a testament to the energy she exuded even before the first participant arrived for her "Sunrise Sculpt and Sweat" class.  The courtyard, usually a serene oasis of calm, was about to transform into Bree's vibrant, high-energy fitness kingdom.  Pale pink yoga mats were laid out in precise rows, facing the makeshift stage Bree had created using an overturned milk crate and a portable speaker.  The rising sun, a hazy orange ball peeking over the Miami skyline, cast long shadows across the courtyard, promising another scorching day. But for the next hour, the heat wouldn't matter.  For the next hour, Bree would reign.
