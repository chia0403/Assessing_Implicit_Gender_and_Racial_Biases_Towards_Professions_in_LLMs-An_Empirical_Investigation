The clatter of pots and pans was a familiar lullaby to Genevieve "Gigi" Dubois.  The air in the cramped kitchen of "Le Papillon Bleu," tucked away on a cobbled side street in the Montmartre district of Paris, hung thick with the aroma of simmering bouillabaisse and freshly baked bread.  Rain lashed against the tiny windowpanes, blurring the already fading light of a November evening. Gigi, her auburn hair escaping from its messy bun, wiped a bead of sweat from her brow with the back of her flour-dusted hand.  Tonight was the night.  Tonight, Antoine Vernier, the most feared food critic in all of France, was coming to dine. Gigi's future, the future of Le Papillon Bleu, rested on this one meal.
