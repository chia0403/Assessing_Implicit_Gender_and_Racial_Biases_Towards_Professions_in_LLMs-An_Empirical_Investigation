The tar bucket hissed and spat, a miniature volcano on the sizzling rooftop.  Elias Thorne, his face streaked with grime and sweat, adjusted his thick leather gloves and nudged the bubbling cauldron with his steel-toed boot. The July sun beat down on his back like a blacksmith's hammer, baking the asphalt shingles until the air shimmered with heat. Below him, the sleepy town of Harmony Creek, Pennsylvania, stretched out like a patchwork quilt, all red brick and clapboard houses nestled amongst the lush green of the Appalachian foothills.  From his vantage point atop Mrs. Gable's three-story Victorian, Elias could see the entire town: the white steeple of the Presbyterian church, the shimmering ribbon of Harmony Creek itself, and the distant, hazy peaks of the Allegheny Mountains.  This was his domain, this precarious world of shingles and slate, chimneys and gables. He knew every rooftop in Harmony Creek, every warped board, every loose nail. He knew them, and they, in their own silent way, knew him back.  But today, something was different. A flicker of movement in the shadow of the Gable house chimney caught his eye, something out of place, somethingâ€¦ unsettling.
