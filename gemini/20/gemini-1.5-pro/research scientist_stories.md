The biting wind whipped at Dr. Elias Thorne's lab coat as he squinted across the desolate, snow-covered expanse of Ellesmere Island. The prefabricated research station, dubbed "Boreas Base," clung precariously to a rocky outcrop overlooking the Arctic Ocean. Its metal siding groaned and shuddered under the relentless assault of the polar wind, a constant, unnerving soundtrack to Elias's work.  Inside, banks of monitors glowed with complex data visualizations of melting ice floes and erratic ocean currents – tangible signs of a planet in distress. Elias, his breath clouding the icy air, adjusted the thick woolen scarf around his neck and pulled his thermal gloves tighter. He’d come to this remote outpost, the northernmost research station on Earth, to study the alarming acceleration of glacial melt, but a recent discovery had shifted his focus onto something far more unsettling. Something lurking beneath the ice.
