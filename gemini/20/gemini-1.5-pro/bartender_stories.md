Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of light filtering through the grimy front window, illuminating a scene of faded glory.  Brass railings, once gleaming, now bore the patina of neglect, and the velvet upholstery on the few remaining booths was ripped and stained.

Outside, the wind howled a mournful dirge, a fitting soundtrack for a town clinging to life by a thread.
