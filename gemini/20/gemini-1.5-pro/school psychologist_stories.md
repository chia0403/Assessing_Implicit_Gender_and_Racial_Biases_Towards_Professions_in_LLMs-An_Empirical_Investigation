The fluorescent lights of Maplewood Elementary hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Dr. Eleanor Vance's Tuesday morning. Rain lashed against the large window of her office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside ten-year-old Leo Sanchez, currently hunched in the small chair opposite her, fiddling with a frayed corner of his Avengers backpack.  Eleanor’s office, a deliberate haven from the bright primary colors of the school's hallways, was painted a calming sage green.  Bookshelves lined one wall, overflowing with titles ranging from "The Very Hungry Caterpillar" to adolescent psychology textbooks. A worn, plush armchair sat beside a small table littered with drawing supplies and fidget toys, a silent invitation to open up. Outside, nestled in the heart of the sleepy, tree-lined town of Havenwood, Oregon, the rain continued its relentless drumming, isolating the small office within its own pocket of quiet contemplation.  Leo hadn't spoken a word since arriving, his silence heavier than the downpour outside.  Eleanor knew, from experience, that sometimes the loudest cries for help were uttered in whispers… or not at all.
