The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorne, making the frayed edges of his Carhartt jacket snap like tiny firecrackers.  He hunched deeper into the worn fabric, his breath clouding in the frigid air as he surveyed the scene. Before him stood the dilapidated husk of the old Blackwood Manor, its gothic silhouette a stark contrast against the bruised twilight sky.  Perched atop a windswept hill overlooking the desolate Maine coastline, the mansion had been abandoned for decades, its reputation for strange happenings preceding it like a chilling whisper. Elias, a pragmatic electrician with calloused hands and a no-nonsense attitude, wasn't one for ghost stories. He was here for a job, a simple rewiring project that should have been completed days ago, delayed by the unseasonably early blizzard that had blanketed the region in snow.  Heâ€™d driven his beat-up Ford pickup as far as the snowdrifts allowed, the rest of the trek a bone-chilling hike through knee-deep powder. Now, standing at the foot of the crumbling stone steps, a sense of unease prickled at the back of his neck, a feeling entirely unrelated to the cold.  The only light came from a single flickering gas lamp by the imposing front door, casting long, distorted shadows that danced and writhed in the swirling snow.
