The clatter of horse-drawn carriages on cobblestones, the cries of street vendors hawking their wares, and the ever-present aroma of coal smoke and brewing coffee formed the symphony of Genevieve Beaumont's mornings. Her atelier, tucked between a bustling bakery and a somewhat dubious apothecary on Rue de l'Ã‰toile, was a sanctuary from the clamor of 1888 Paris.  Sunlight, filtered through the large, dusty window facing the street, illuminated bolts of silk, satin, and lace stacked high against the walls.  Genevieve, her auburn hair pinned back in a practical bun, stood hunched over her workbench, the soft glow highlighting the intricate beadwork she was applying to a midnight blue ballgown.  The gas lamps, though unlit in the daytime, cast long, skeletal shadows across the room, giving the space an ethereal, almost otherworldly feel, a stark contrast to the vibrant life just beyond the glass pane. This morning, however, a different sort of vibrancy, a nervous energy, thrummed beneath the usual Parisian bustle, and Genevieve, with her needle poised mid-air, felt the prickle of unease on the back of her neck.
