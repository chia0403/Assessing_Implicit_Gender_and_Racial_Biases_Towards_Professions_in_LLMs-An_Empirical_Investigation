The biting November wind whipped off the East River, plastering Amelia "Amy" Reyes's auburn hair across her face as she surveyed the scene.  Below her, on a closed-off section of Roosevelt Island Tramway platform, a chaotic ballet of grips, gaffers, and extras swirled under the harsh glare of industrial lights.  Amy, perched precariously on a scaffolding platform, chewed on the end of her pen, her brow furrowed in concentration.  The scene – a tense hostage exchange set against the dramatic backdrop of the Manhattan skyline – was crucial to her latest project, "Fractured Metropolis," a gritty neo-noir thriller that she'd poured two years of her life into. The pressure to deliver, both artistically and commercially, was a physical weight in her chest, heavier than the bulky down jacket she wore against the encroaching cold.  This shot, this single, pivotal moment, had to be perfect.
