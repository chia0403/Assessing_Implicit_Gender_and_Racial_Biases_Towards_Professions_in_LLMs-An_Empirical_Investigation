The wind, sharp and smelling of approaching rain, whipped at Elias Thorne’s weathered face as he surveyed his fields.  Dusk bled across the rolling hills of the Auberon Valley, painting the ripening barley a deep, bruised gold.  Elias, his calloused hands thrust deep into the pockets of his worn canvas coat, squinted at the gathering clouds.  His farm, Thorne’s Hollow, nestled snugly between two forested knolls, had been in his family for five generations.  Each furrowed field, each weathered barn plank, whispered stories of his ancestors, their triumphs and struggles etched into the very land he now worked.  This year, however, the whispers held a note of unease. The barley, usually robust and tall by this time, was stunted and thin, a disquieting premonition hanging heavy in the air like the impending storm.
