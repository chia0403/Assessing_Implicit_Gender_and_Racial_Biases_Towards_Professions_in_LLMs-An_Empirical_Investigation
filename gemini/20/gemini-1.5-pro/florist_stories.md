The bell above the door of "Petal & Stem" jingled merrily, a counterpoint to the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of Eliza Jane Wilder's shears.  Outside, the cobbled streets of Port Blossom, Maine, glistened under a thin coat of November ice, the air thick with the salty tang of the nearby Atlantic. Inside, the small shop was a riot of color and fragrance, a defiant burst of spring against the encroaching winter.  Buckets overflowing with roses, lilies, and exotic orchids lined the walls, their perfume mingling with the earthy scent of damp moss and the sweetness of Eliza's signature cinnamon-apple potpourri.  Sunlight, filtered through the frosted windowpanes, painted kaleidoscopic patterns on the floor, illuminating dust motes dancing in the warm air. Eliza, her brow furrowed in concentration, was crafting a particularly intricate bridal bouquet of white peonies and cascading ivy, the silence broken only by the crackling fire in the small hearth at the back of the shop.  This was her sanctuary, her haven, a place where the thorns of life seemed to melt away, leaving only the beauty and fragility of nature. But the jingle of the bell, followed by the heavy thud of the door closing, hinted that this peace wouldnâ€™t last.
