The oppressive humidity of a late July afternoon clung to Savannah like Spanish moss, draping itself over the wrought-iron balconies and sweating into the cobblestone streets.  Cicadas buzzed their relentless chorus from the live oaks lining Forsyth Park, their song a hypnotic backdrop to the languid pace of the city.  Amelia Grace Hawthorne, however, felt anything but languid.  She stood poised at the edge of Chippewa Square, her briefcase clutched in one hand, a delicately embroidered handkerchief dabbing the perspiration from her brow with the other.  Her pale blue linen suit, impeccably tailored, was already beginning to wilt in the heat, but her smile remained crisp and professional.  The historic Marshall House, a grand dame of Southern hospitality, loomed before her, its white columns gleaming like teeth in a wide, welcoming grin.  Amelia took a deep breath, adjusted the strap of her briefcase, and strode forward.  This was her biggest client yet, and she wasn't about to let a little Savannah heat wilt her chances of landing the deal.
