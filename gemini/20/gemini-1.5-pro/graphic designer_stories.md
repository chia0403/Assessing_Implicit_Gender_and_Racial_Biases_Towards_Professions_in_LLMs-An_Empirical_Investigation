Rain lashed against the oversized windows of Beatrice "Bea" Aurelia Holloway's studio apartment, blurring the already fading neon glow of the Seattle skyline.  Her space, a carefully curated chaos of Pantone swatches, half-finished sketches, and overflowing bookshelves crammed with design theory and vintage comic books, usually buzzed with the low hum of her iMac and the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of her stylus. Tonight, however, the only sound was the relentless drumming of the downpour and the occasional sigh escaping Bea's lips as she stared at the mockingly blank canvas on her screen.  The deadline for the rebranding of "Seattle Suds," the city's newest craft brewery, loomed like a dark cloud, even darker than the ones currently drenching Puget Sound.  She'd been wrestling with the logo for days, sketching countless variations of hops and beer mugs, each one feeling more generic and uninspired than the last.  The pressure was mounting, not just from the client, but from Bea herself.  This was her chance to finally break free from designing flyers for dog walkers and websites for used car dealerships. This was her chance to prove she was more than just a talented freelancer; she was a *designer*.
