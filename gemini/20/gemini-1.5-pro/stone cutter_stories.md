The biting wind whipped off the Tyrwhitt Peaks, carrying with it the scent of pine and the whisper of impending snow.  Grey clouds, heavy with the promise of winter, clung to the jagged peaks, obscuring the summit from the village of Quarry Hollow nestled in the valley below.  The village, a haphazard collection of stone houses huddled together for warmth, seemed carved from the very mountain itself.  Here, amongst the rhythmic clang of hammers and the rasp of chisels, lived Elias Thorne, a stone cutter whose hands, calloused and strong, knew the language of granite better than any spoken tongue.  His workshop, a small, sturdy structure built against the cliff face, was filled with the dust of ages and the ghosts of unfinished projects. A single window, facing the perpetually shadowed north face of the peaks, offered a view that was both inspiring and daunting, a constant reminder of the raw, unforgiving power of nature against which Elias plied his craft.  This morning, however, the view held something else â€“ a flickering light, too high to be a campfire, too erratic for a star.
