The clang of the fishmonger's bell, a shrill cry against the damp harbor air, announced the start of another day in Port Blossom.  Salt spray kissed Amelia "Millie" Hawthorne's face as she unlocked the door to "The Salty Spoon," her tiny, but beloved, cafe perched on the edge of the wharf.  Inside, the air hung thick with the comforting aroma of yesterday's baking - cinnamon rolls and sourdough loaves still nestled beneath linen cloths.  Millie, her auburn braid swinging against her back like a pendulum, surveyed her domain: mismatched tables painted in shades of seafoam green and coral, fishing nets draped across the ceiling beams, and the worn, but reliable, cast iron stove humming a low, welcoming song in the corner. This was her haven, a place where the clatter of cutlery mingled with the cries of gulls and the rhythmic slap of waves against the pilings.  Today, however, the usual peace of Millie's morning routine was punctuated by a flutter of nerves. Today was the day the esteemed food critic, Mr. Barnaby Sterling, was due to arrive in Port Blossom.
