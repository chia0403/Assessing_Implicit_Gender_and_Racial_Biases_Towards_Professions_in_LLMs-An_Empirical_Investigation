The smoky haze clinging to the velvet curtains of the Blue Note hadn't quite dissipated from the previous set, a cacophony of frantic bebop that still vibrated in Isabella "Izzy" Moreau's bones.  She sat in the cramped backstage area, the chipped paint on the brick walls the same faded ochre as the dregs of her lukewarm coffee.  A single bare bulb cast long shadows, exaggerating the clutter of instrument cases, discarded set lists, and half-eaten plates of greasy diner food.  Outside, the November wind whipped down 52nd Street, rattling the fire escape like a nervous skeleton. Tonight was Izzy's New York debut, the culmination of years spent honing her craft in smoky clubs and dimly lit bars across the Midwest. Her palms were slick with sweat, despite the biting chill seeping through the poorly insulated walls.  Tonight, everything was on the line.  Tonight, she had to prove she was more than just another hopeful voice swallowed by the cityâ€™s relentless rhythm.
