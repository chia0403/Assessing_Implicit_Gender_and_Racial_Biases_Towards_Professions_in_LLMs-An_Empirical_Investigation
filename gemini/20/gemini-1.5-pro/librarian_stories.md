The fluorescent lights of the Abernathy Memorial Library hummed a low, constant B-flat, a sound Elias Finch had long since tuned out.  Dust motes, disturbed by the late afternoon sun slanting through the tall, arched windows, danced in the golden beams. Outside, the sleepy town of Harmony, Nebraska, stretched out in a predictable grid of tidy lawns and clapboard houses.  Inside, Elias, with his ink-stained fingers and perpetually rumpled tweed jacket, was reshelving a biography of Eleanor Roosevelt, his mind more occupied with the perplexing disappearance of the 1928 edition of  "Birds of Prey of the Northern Plains" than the former First Lady.  It wasn't the monetary value of the book that bothered him – though it was a rare find –  it was the unsettling gap it left on the shelf, a missing tooth in a perfectly aligned smile.  Harmony, for all its placid surface, held secrets, and Elias suspected this missing book was a fluttering clue to one of them.
