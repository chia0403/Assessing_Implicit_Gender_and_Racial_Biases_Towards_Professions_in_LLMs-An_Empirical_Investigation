The opulent lobby of the Hotel Magnifique hummed with a low, constant thrum of activity.  Crystal chandeliers, each a miniature galaxy of sparkling light, cast dancing reflections across the polished marble floor.  The air, conditioned to a perfect 72 degrees, was subtly scented with a blend of sandalwood and bergamot.  Behind the imposing mahogany concierge desk, Elias Thorne, his name tag gleaming gold against his crisp navy suit, surveyed the scene with an almost preternatural calm.  Outside, the Parisian rain hammered against the tall windows, blurring the already twilight-tinged view of the Eiffel Tower.  It was the kind of evening that sent tourists scurrying inside, seeking refuge and demanding the kind of impossible miracles only a seasoned concierge like Elias could deliver. And tonight, he had a feeling, was going to be particularly miraculous.
