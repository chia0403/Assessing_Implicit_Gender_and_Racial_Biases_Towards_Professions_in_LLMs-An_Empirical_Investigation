The biting November wind whipped around Ms. Eleanor Vance, plastering stray strands of her auburn hair across her face as she hurried across the near-deserted parking lot of Northwood High.  The sodium vapor lamps cast a sickly yellow glow over the asphalt, highlighting the patches of lingering, dirty snow that refused to melt in the shadowed corners. Northwood, a sprawling brick behemoth of a building nestled in the heart of rural Vermont, looked more like a penitentiary than a place of learning under this oppressive sky. Inside, a lone light flickered in the window of Room 214, Eleanor’s classroom. It was almost 7 pm, a full two hours after the last bell, and the silence of the empty halls pressed in on her, amplified by the mournful howl of the wind.  Tonight, however, Eleanor wasn't grading papers or preparing lesson plans.  Tonight, she was waiting. And she had a terrible feeling about what – or who – she was waiting for.
