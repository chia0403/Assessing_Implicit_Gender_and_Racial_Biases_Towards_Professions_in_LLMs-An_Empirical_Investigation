The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, carrying the scent of stale beer and desperation, and plastered Dr. Elias Thorne’s carefully styled hair across his forehead.  He shoved his hands deeper into the pockets of his camel-hair overcoat, the crisp November air doing little to penetrate its luxurious warmth.  His clinic, "Thorne Chiropractic & Wellness," nestled between a dusty pawn shop and a perpetually flickering neon sign advertising “Psychic Readings,” was a stark contrast to the gleaming skyscrapers that dominated the Chicago skyline just a few blocks east.  This was the Near North Side, a neighborhood teetering precariously between gentrification and decay, a reflection of Elias’s own internal struggle between the life he'd envisioned and the reality he inhabited. He’d imagined sleek, modern waiting rooms filled with affluent clientele seeking relief from their tennis elbow and golf swings gone awry. Instead, he treated bus drivers with chronic back pain, construction workers with slipped discs, and the occasional bewildered tourist who'd stumbled upon his clinic while lost.  Tonight, however, something felt different.  The streetlights flickered erratically, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to writhe and twist in the periphery of his vision.  And as Elias finally reached his door, he noticed a single, blood-red rose lying on the worn welcome mat, its petals already beginning to curl at the edges in the frigid air.
