The biting wind whipped at Captain Evangeline "Eva" Moreau's flight suit as she prepped her De Havilland Beaver for takeoff.  The sky above Resolution Island, Nunavut, was a brutal, breathtaking expanse of bruised purple bleeding into gunmetal grey.  The late November air, sharp enough to sting exposed skin, carried the scent of ice and the mournful cry of unseen gulls.  Resolution, a lonely outpost clinging to the northern edge of Hudson Bay, was a smear of prefabricated buildings and flickering lights against the vast, encroaching darkness of the Arctic wilderness.  Eva, her breath clouding the crisp air, secured the cargo hatch – a shipment of vital medical supplies destined for a remote Inuit community further north – and ran a gloved hand over the plane's weathered fuselage.  This wasn't her first rodeo in these unforgiving climes, but something about the deepening gloom and the unsettling stillness of the air prickled the hairs on the back of her neck. This flight, she sensed, would be different.
