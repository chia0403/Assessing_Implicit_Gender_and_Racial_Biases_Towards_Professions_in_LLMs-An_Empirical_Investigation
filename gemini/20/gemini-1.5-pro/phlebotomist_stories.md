The fluorescent lights of St. Jude's Hospital hummed a monotonous B flat, a soundtrack Amelia Reyes had grown accustomed to over her five years as a phlebotomist.  The pre-dawn quiet, however, was unusual.  Usually, by 5:30 AM, the clatter of breakfast trays and the low murmur of nurses' shift changes would have filled the sterile hallways of the sixth floor.  This morning, a thick, almost expectant silence clung to the air, broken only by the rhythmic beep of a heart monitor down the hall.  Amelia, her burgundy scrubs starched crisp and her name tag gleaming under the harsh lights, tightened her ponytail and pushed her cart, laden with vials and tourniquets, towards room 612.  The order slip read: "Stat draw â€“ Type and Crossmatch."  A chill snaked down her spine. Stat draws at this hour never meant anything good.
