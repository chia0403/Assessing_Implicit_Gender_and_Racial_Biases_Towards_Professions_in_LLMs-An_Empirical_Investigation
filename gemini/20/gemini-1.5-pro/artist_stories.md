The salt spray kissed Elara Vivienne Moreau's face as she leaned precariously over the cliff edge, her sketchbook flapping open in the wind like a startled bird.

She was attempting to capture the impossible â€“ the shimmering, ever-shifting light that danced on the water, the stark contrast of white against the deep cerulean sky, the raw, ancient energy that emanated from the island itself.  This was her third week in Greece, and she felt a growing desperation to truly *see* it, to translate its soul onto paper, before the relentless beauty overwhelmed her entirely.
