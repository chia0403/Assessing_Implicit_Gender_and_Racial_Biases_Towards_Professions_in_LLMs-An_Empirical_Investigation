The biting November wind whipped around Professor Elias Thorne, tugging at the edges of his tweed overcoat as he hurried across the cobbled quad of St. Jude's College, Oxford.  Gargoyles leered down from the honey-coloured stone buildings, their grotesque features softened by a dusting of snow.  The ancient college, a labyrinth of archways, hidden gardens, and echoing halls, was preparing for the annual Yuletide feast, a tradition Elias both cherished and dreaded. He clutched a leather-bound volume of Chaucer under his arm, its pages brittle with age, offering little comfort against the encroaching darkness and the peculiar sense of unease that had been settling upon him like a shroud these past few weeks. The air hummed with an unspoken tension, a feeling not unlike the static before a thunderstorm, and Elias couldn't shake the feeling that something within the hallowed walls of St. Jude's was deeply, unsettlingly amiss.
