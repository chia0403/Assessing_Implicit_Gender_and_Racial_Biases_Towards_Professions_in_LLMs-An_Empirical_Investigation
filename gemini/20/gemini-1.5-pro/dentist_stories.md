The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Eleanor Vance as she hurried across the cobbled lane, her breath puffing out in white plumes. The wrought-iron sign of "Vance Family Dentistry" creaked above her, the painted tooth wobbling precariously in the gale. Oakhaven, Maine, a town clinging to the rocky coastline like a barnacle, was bracing itself for another harsh winter. The salt spray from the churning Atlantic coated everything with a fine, gritty film, and the air smelled sharply of brine and pine. Eleanor pushed open the heavy oak door of her practice, the small brass bell above it jingling a welcome reprieve from the windâ€™s howl. Inside, the waiting room was warm and inviting, a stark contrast to the blustery world outside.  A fire crackled merrily in the hearth, casting flickering shadows on the worn, floral-patterned armchairs and the meticulously organized magazine rack.  It was a Tuesday morning, typically quiet before the after-school rush, and only Mrs. Henderson, the town librarian, sat patiently knitting a vibrant purple scarf.  Eleanor shrugged off her thick wool coat, the quiet calm a balm to the unsettling feeling that had been prickling at her since dawn.
