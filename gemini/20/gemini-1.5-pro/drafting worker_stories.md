The flickering fluorescent lights of the Kellenberg & Sons Drafting office hummed a monotonous B flat, a soundtrack to Amelia Reyes’ life. Outside, the Chicago wind howled like a banshee, rattling the ancient window panes of the third-floor office.  Dust motes danced in the anemic light, swirling around Amelia’s drafting table like miniature, chaotic planets.  T-squares, triangles, and compasses littered the surface, a metallic constellation around the blueprints for the new Peterson apartment complex.  It was Friday afternoon, 3:47 pm, precisely twenty-three minutes until Amelia could escape the oppressive beige of Kellenberg & Sons and lose herself in the vibrant hues of the city she loved, but which, from this vantage point, felt miles away. The scent of stale coffee and Mr. Henderson’s pipe tobacco hung heavy in the air, a persistent reminder that freedom was still just out of reach.  Amelia tapped her pencil against the blueprint, a nervous rhythm echoing the frantic beat of her heart. This project was important, a potential stepping stone to something more, something beyond the endless repetition of lines and angles.  But today, the lines seemed to blur, the angles to mock her, and the Peterson apartment complex felt less like a stepping stone and more like a tomb.
