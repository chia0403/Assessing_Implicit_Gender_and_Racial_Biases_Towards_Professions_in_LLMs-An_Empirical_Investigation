The rusty swing sign creaked a mournful tune in the humid Louisiana air, the faded lettering barely visible:  "Bartholomew "Barty" Beauchemin, Barber."  Barty himself, a man sculpted from sun-baked mahogany and seasoned with the scent of Bay Rum and regret, sat perched on a worn leather stool behind his ancient barber chair.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight slicing through the grimy window of his shop, illuminating the swirling chaos of his cluttered workspace:  half-empty bottles of hair tonic, chipped ceramic mugs, dog-eared magazines dating back to the Eisenhower administration, and a surprisingly pristine collection of straight razors gleaming in their leather case.  The only other sound besides the sighing swing sign was the relentless drone of cicadas, a constant, buzzing soundtrack to the slow, sleepy rhythm of life in the forgotten bayou town of Lafitte.  Today, however, the usual languor was pierced by a nervous energy, a prickling anticipation that hung heavier than the humidity.  Barty knew, with a certainty that settled deep in his bones, that this Tuesday wouldn't be like any other.
