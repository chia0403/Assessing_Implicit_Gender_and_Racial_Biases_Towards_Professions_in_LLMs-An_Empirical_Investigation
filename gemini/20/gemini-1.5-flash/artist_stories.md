The biting November wind whipped Amelia Blackwood’s auburn hair across her face as she wrestled the canvas onto its easel.  Salt spray from the churning grey sea, a relentless battering ram against the rugged cliffs of Cornwall, misted the already damp air.  Her small, weather-beaten studio, perched precariously on the cliff edge overlooking Porthcurno Bay, was a chaotic symphony of paint tubes, brushes bristling in mismatched jars, and half-finished canvases leaning against every available surface.  The air smelled of turpentine, seaweed, and the lingering scent of woodsmoke from the tiny cottage nestled behind it – a scent as familiar and comforting as the rhythmic crash of the waves against the rocks below.  Amelia, bundled in a thick wool cardigan, shivered, not entirely from the cold.  The canvas before her, a vast expanse of primed linen, mocked her with its blankness, a stark contrast to the tumultuous beauty of the storm raging outside.  This painting, she knew, would be her masterpiece, or her undoing.
