The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Mia” Holloway’s auburn hair across her face as she stood on the precipice of the cliff, the raw North Sea churning below.  Salt spray kissed her cheeks, a stark contrast to the warmth of the thick, hand-knitted scarf she’d pulled high.  Before her, perched precariously on the windswept headland, stood Dunvegan Castle, a gothic behemoth of grey stone that seemed to claw at the bruised sky.  Its turrets, silhouetted against the stormy sunset, were skeletal fingers reaching for a mercy that the unforgiving weather clearly wouldn't offer.  Mia, renowned architect and specialist in historical restoration, felt a familiar thrill – a mixture of fear and exhilaration – as she assessed her latest, and arguably most daunting, project.  The castle, steeped in centuries of legend and neglect, whispered stories of forgotten kings and tempestuous queens, its very stones imbued with a palpable sense of history.  This wasn't just another restoration; it was a pilgrimage into the heart of a crumbling legend.
