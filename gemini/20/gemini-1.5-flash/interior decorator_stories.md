The chipped porcelain cherub, perched precariously on a stack of dusty, floral-patterned wallpaper rolls, seemed to sneer at Aurelia “Rella” Nightingale.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single shaft of sunlight slicing through the grimy window of the abandoned Victorian mansion, danced in the air like mischievous sprites.  Rella, her tailored charcoal trousers dusted with the same fine layer of grime, sighed.  This wasn't the picturesque Cotswolds restoration she'd envisioned.  This was Blackwood Manor, a crumbling behemoth clinging to the cliff edge overlooking the turbulent North Sea, its skeletal branches clawing at the perpetually stormy sky. The salty tang of the sea air, usually invigorating, felt suffocating in the suffocating gloom of the decaying interior.  It was less a house, and more a mausoleum waiting for its occupant.  And Rella, despite her renowned talent for transforming dilapidated spaces into breathtaking havens, felt a prickle of unease settle in the pit of her stomach. This wasn't just about peeling paint and outdated fixtures; this felt… different.
