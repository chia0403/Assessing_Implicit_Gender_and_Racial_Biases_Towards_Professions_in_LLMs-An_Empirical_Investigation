The biting Montana wind howled a mournful song around the cab of Ezekiel "Zeke" Stone's eighteen-wheeler, a lonely counterpoint to the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the tires on the icy highway.  Snow, thick and unforgiving, plastered itself against the windshield, obscuring the already fading light.  Zeke, his breath misting in the frigid air, wrestled with the steering wheel, guiding his rig – a battered but trusty Kenworth he'd affectionately nicknamed "Betsy" – along the treacherous, barely-maintained stretch of I-90 that snaked through the Big Sky country.  The radio crackled with static, a fitting accompaniment to the desolate landscape unfolding before him; miles of snow-covered plains, broken only by the occasional skeletal silhouette of a pine tree, stretching towards a horizon swallowed by the gathering dusk.  The only other signs of life were the swirling snow itself, and the faint, distant glow of a lonely gas station miles ahead – a beacon promising warmth, but perhaps, also danger.
