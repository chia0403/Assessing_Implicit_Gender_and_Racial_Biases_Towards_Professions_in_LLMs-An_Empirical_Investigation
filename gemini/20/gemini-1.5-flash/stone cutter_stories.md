The rasp of steel on granite echoed through the narrow valley, a lonely counterpoint to the ceaseless chatter of the River Esk.  Mist, thick as a shroud, clung to the heather-covered hillsides, obscuring the already faint path that wound its way upwards towards the abandoned quarry.  This was no picturesque scene for tourists; this was the harsh, unforgiving landscape that had shaped Elias Thorne, a man as weathered and stubborn as the very stone he shaped.  Elias, his hands gnarled and stained the colour of dried blood from years spent wrestling with the unforgiving rock, paused in his work, the rhythmic rasp momentarily silenced.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and something elseâ€¦ something metallic and sharp, clinging to the chill morning air like a premonition.
