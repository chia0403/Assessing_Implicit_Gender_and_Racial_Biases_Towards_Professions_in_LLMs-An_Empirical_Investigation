The salt spray stung Detective Inspector Amelia Katherine Stone's face as the ferry bucked violently against the churning grey sea. Rain lashed down, blurring the already indistinct outline of the Isle of Skye, a jagged, brooding silhouette against the bruised twilight sky.  The wind, a howling banshee, threatened to rip the thin, navy-blue anorak from her shoulders, and Amelia pulled it tighter, her gaze fixed on the skeletal remains of a ruined castle clinging precariously to the cliff face.  This was no tourist trip.  The call had come in just hours ago, a terse message relayed through a crackling radio: a body found on the island, circumstances… unusual.  And Amelia, a seasoned detective hardened by years on the Glasgow force, knew that ‘unusual’ in the remote Hebrides often translated to something far more sinister.
