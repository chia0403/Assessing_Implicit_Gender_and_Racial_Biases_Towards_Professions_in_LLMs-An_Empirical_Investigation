The air in "Lacquer Lounge" hung thick with the cloying sweetness of almond and vanilla, a fragrance that normally soothed Esme Valentine's frayed nerves but tonight did little to mask the metallic tang of fear clinging to the air.  Esme, whose nimble fingers usually danced across nail beds with practiced grace, felt them tremble as she stared at the shattered remains of her prized jade manicure set – scattered across the otherwise immaculate cherrywood floor like fallen stars.  Rain lashed against the large bay window overlooking Bleecker Street, blurring the neon glow of the city into a hazy, indistinct smear.  The usually vibrant street, usually bustling with late-night energy, was eerily silent except for the rhythmic drumming of the storm.  Tonight, even the usual comforting hum of the salon’s nail dryers felt ominous.
