The air hung thick and sweet, a cloying perfume of roasting garlic and simmering saffron that clung to the rough-hewn stone walls of the Trattoria della Luna.  Rain lashed against the leaded windows, blurring the already indistinct lights of the cobbled street outside.  Inside, however, a controlled chaos reigned.  Chef Isabella Rossellini, her usually immaculate white chef's jacket stained with a suspicious smear of something vaguely tomato-based, surveyed her domain with a frown as sharp as the chef's knife she held loosely in her hand.  The clatter of pans, the hiss of the stovetop, and the shouted orders of her sous chef all formed a familiar, if slightly frantic, symphony. Tonight, however, the usual pre-service jitters felt different; tonight, something was off.  The air, even beyond the scent of the food, crackled with a tension that Isabella, with her twenty years in the kitchen, could taste as readily as she could the reduction simmering on the stove.
