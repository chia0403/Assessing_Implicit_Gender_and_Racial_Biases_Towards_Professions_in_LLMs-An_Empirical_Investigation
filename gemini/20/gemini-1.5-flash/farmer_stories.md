The biting November wind whipped across the fallow fields of Elderwood Farm, carrying with it the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves.  Each gust rattled the skeletal branches of the ancient oak that stood sentinel over the weathered farmhouse, its gnarled limbs like arthritic fingers clawing at the bruised twilight sky.

Elias, a farmer through and through, his hands calloused and cracked from years of wrestling with stubborn soil and uncooperative weather, sat hunched over a chipped mug of lukewarm tea, the flickering firelight dancing in his weary eyes.  The silence of the farm, usually a comforting blanket, tonight felt heavy, pregnant with an unspoken dread that clung to him like the clinging mud of the recently plowed fields.
