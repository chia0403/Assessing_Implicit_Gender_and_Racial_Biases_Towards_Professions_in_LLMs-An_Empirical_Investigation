The chipped paint of Dr. Eleanor Vance's waiting room was a familiar comfort, a muted grey that mirrored the November drizzle blurring the city lights outside.  Rain lashed against the tall, arched windows of her practice, located in a converted brownstone on a quiet, tree-lined street in Brooklyn.  The air hung heavy with the scent of old books and slightly stale coffee, a subtle aroma only Eleanor seemed to notice anymore.  The ticking of an antique grandfather clock in the corner punctuated the silence, each tick a tiny hammer blow against the quiet anxieties simmering within the four walls. Tonight, however, the silence felt especially thick, a palpable weight pressing down on Eleanor as she reviewed the day's notes, the last flickering light of the desktop lamp illuminating the tired lines etched around her eyes.  Another long day of navigating the tangled paths of her clients' minds lay behind her, and the promise of an equally challenging one loomed ahead.  But tonight, a particularly unsettling case gnawed at her, a feeling of unease settling deep in her bones, far heavier than the usual professional concern.
