The chill wind, sharp as a cleaver, sliced through Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's thick wool coat as he wrestled the last of the day's carcasses into the butcher shop's icebox.  Barty's breath plumed white against the pre-dawn gloom clinging to the cobbled lanes of Oakhaven, a town nestled so deeply in the valley that the sun didn't properly grace its streets until well past noon.  The only light came from the flickering gas lamps, casting long, skeletal shadows from the crooked timbered buildings that lined Butcher's Row, a street perpetually scented with the iron tang of blood and the earthy perfume of sawdust.  Inside Barty's shop, "Butterfield's Best," the air was thick with the colder, cleaner scent of hanging meats â€“ beef, lamb, and pork, all meticulously displayed, each cut a testament to Barty's skill and decades of experience.  The rhythmic *thunk* of his cleaver, a constant companion since his apprenticeship, echoed faintly in the stillness, a lullaby to the sleeping town.
