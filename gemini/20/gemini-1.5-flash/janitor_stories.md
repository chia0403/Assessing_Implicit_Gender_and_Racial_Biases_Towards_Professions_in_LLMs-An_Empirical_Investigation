The fluorescent lights of the Blackwood Academy gymnasium hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the squeak of Elias Thorne’s worn sneakers on the polished maple floor.  Dust motes, illuminated like tiny galaxies, danced in the beams as Elias, a man whose shoulders slumped under the weight of fifty years and a lifetime of unspoken disappointments, pushed his mop bucket across the vast expanse.  The air hung heavy with the lingering scent of sweat, linoleum polish, and the faint, almost imperceptible aroma of old leather from the basketballs abandoned in the corner.  It was 2:17 AM, the heart of the night, and Blackwood Academy, usually a hive of youthful energy, was swallowed by an echoing silence broken only by the rhythmic swish of Elias’s mop and the occasional distant chirp of a cricket bravely venturing inside through a cracked window pane.
