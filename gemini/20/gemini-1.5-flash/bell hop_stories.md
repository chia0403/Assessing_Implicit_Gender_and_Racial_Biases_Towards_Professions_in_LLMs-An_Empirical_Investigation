The brass spittoon gleamed under the dim, gaslight-flickering lobby of the Grand Majestic Hotel.  Dust motes, disturbed by the sluggish turning of a single, oversized ceiling fan, danced in the hazy air, illuminated briefly by the sporadic flash of lightning outside.  Rain lashed against the towering arched windows, a relentless percussion accompanying the mournful wail of a distant foghorn.  Twenty-year-old  Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, a bellhop whose uniform, once crisp, now bore the telltale marks of countless hurried trips and spilled drinks, stood patiently beside the imposing mahogany reception desk. The scent of stale cigars, damp wool, and something faintly floral – perhaps a desperate attempt at masking the ever-present aroma of rain-soaked city – hung heavy in the air.  His calloused hands, usually busy with luggage, fidgeted with the worn brass tip of his cap.  He’d seen a lot of things come and go through those revolving doors, but tonight felt different, heavier, even for the Grand Majestic.
