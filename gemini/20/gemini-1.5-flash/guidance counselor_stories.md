The chipped paint of Ms. Eleanor Vance’s office desk flaked onto the worn, floral-patterned carpet like a slow, melancholic snowfall.  Sunlight, filtered through the dusty blinds of Northwood High’s west wing, cast long shadows across the room, illuminating the precarious stacks of college brochures and the half-eaten bag of stale pretzels abandoned on her desk. The air hung heavy with the scent of old paper, desperation, and the faint, lingering aroma of Mrs. Henderson’s lavender perfume – a testament to the emotional rollercoaster that had been Eleanor’s Tuesday morning. Outside, the relentless drone of traffic on Highway 17 echoed the inner turmoil of the students who would soon be filing into her office, their futures – and anxieties – as vast and uncertain as the sprawling California landscape visible from the window.  Eleanor Vance, Northwood High’s resident sage (or, as some students less kindly put it, "the resident nag"), sighed, pushing the pretzels aside with a weary hand.  Another day, another avalanche of teenage angst.
