The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Amy” Hawthorne’s hair across her face as she surveyed the frost-covered lacrosse field.  Breath plumed out in ragged white clouds, mirroring the anxious turmoil churning in her gut.  The air hung thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, a stark contrast to the vibrant green of the synthetic turf beneath her worn, mud-caked boots.  This wasn't the manicured, sun-drenched field of summer tournaments; this was the bleak, unforgiving reality of late-season practice at Northwood Academy, a reality underscored by the dismal grey sky threatening snow.  The skeletal branches of the ancient oak trees bordering the field clawed at the lowering clouds, mirroring the desperate clinging to hope she felt within herself.  Amy pulled her Northwood Academy coaching jacket tighter, the embroidered wolf's head a small comfort in the encroaching chill.  The fate of her team, the Northwood Wildcats, hung precariously in the balance, and tonight’s practice felt less like preparation and more like a desperate prayer.
