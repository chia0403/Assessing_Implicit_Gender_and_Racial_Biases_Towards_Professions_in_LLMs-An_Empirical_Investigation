The aroma of cardamom and warm brioche hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the biting November wind whistling down Lavender Lane.  Inside "The Flour Child," the air thrummed with a different kind of energy â€“ the quiet, purposeful bustle of a bakery preparing for its busiest day of the year, the annual Harvest Festival.  Amelia Josephine Hawthorne, her flour-dusted apron a testament to a long morning's work, surveyed her kingdom with a practiced eye.  Rows of perfectly formed croissants, their golden-brown surfaces glistening, lined the display cases.  Loaves of sourdough, their crusts crackling with promise, sat proudly beside plump pumpkin pies, their spiced filling hinting at the autumnal abundance to come.  The clatter of pans and the rhythmic thump of the mixer formed a familiar soundtrack to Amelia's life, a life as sweet and comforting as the pastries she created.
