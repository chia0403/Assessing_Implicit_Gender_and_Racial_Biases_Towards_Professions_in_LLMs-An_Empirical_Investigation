The scent of rosemary and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Aurelia "Rel" Davenport.  Rain lashed against the frosted glass windows of "Shear Perfection," her tiny salon tucked away on a cobbled side street in the ancient port town of Seabrook.  The wind, a howling banshee, rattled the loose panes, threatening to tear them from their aged frames.  Inside, however, a comforting warmth radiated from the ancient wood-burning stove, casting flickering shadows on the worn, but well-loved, antique furniture.  Rel, her fingers stained a kaleidoscope of colours from years of handling dyes, hummed a low, off-key tune as she meticulously swept stray hairs from the worn crimson carpet, the rhythmic swish a counterpoint to the storm raging outside.  Seabrook, usually charmingly sleepy, was tonight a tempestuous beast.  And Rel, for once, felt strangely at peace amidst the chaos.
