The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Katherine Finch's hands, the lukewarm tea doing little to soothe the icy dread that had settled in her stomach.  Rain lashed against the leaded-glass windows of her office, mirroring the storm brewing inside her.  Amelia, a bookkeeper of meticulous habits and even more meticulous accounts, stared at the ledger open before her, the neatly penned figures blurring under the flickering gaslight.  Her office, perched atop the rambling Victorian building that housed Finch & Sons' Mercantile, smelled of old paper, dust motes dancing in the weak illumination, and the faint, unsettling scent of something metallic â€“ a scent that had become increasingly prevalent over the past week, a subtle but persistent undercurrent to the usual smells of dried herbs and aged timber.  Outside, the cobbled streets of Oakhaven, a town clinging stubbornly to its nineteenth-century charm despite the encroaching whispers of modernity, were swallowed by a relentless downpour.  Tonight, however, the rain felt less romantic and more ominous, a fitting soundtrack to the unsettling discovery Amelia had made just moments ago.
