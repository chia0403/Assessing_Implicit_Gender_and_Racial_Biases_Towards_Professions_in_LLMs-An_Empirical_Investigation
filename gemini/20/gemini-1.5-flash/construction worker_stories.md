The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorne’s ankles, stinging the exposed skin above his worn work boots.  He tugged his threadbare beanie lower, the coarse wool scratching against his forehead, a familiar discomfort compared to the gnawing ache in his lower back.  The skeletal framework of the new skyscraper clawed at the bruised grey sky above him, a testament to both human ambition and Elias's aching muscles.  He stood on the 47th floor, a dizzying height that usually instilled a thrill, but today, the view only served to highlight the vastness of his own problems.  The city of Aethelburg stretched out below, a glittering tapestry of light and shadow, a world Elias felt increasingly disconnected from, one steel beam and precarious handhold at a time.  The rhythmic clang of hammers and the distant shriek of power tools formed a relentless soundtrack to his weary existence – a symphony of construction, a dirge for his dwindling hope.
