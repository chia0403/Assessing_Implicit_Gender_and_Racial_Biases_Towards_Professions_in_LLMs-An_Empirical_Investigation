The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s dark hair across her face as she hurried down the rain-slicked cobblestones of Charleston’s French Quarter.  Gas lamps flickered, casting long, distorted shadows that danced with the restless movement of the Spanish moss hanging heavy from the ancient live oaks.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and jasmine, held a chill that seeped deep into her bones, a stark contrast to the humid warmth she’d left behind inside the Charleston Memorial Hospital just moments ago.  Tonight, however, the familiar comfort of the sterile hospital corridors felt a world away.  Amelia clutched her worn leather satchel tighter, its contents – a well-used stethoscope, a small flashlight, and a half-eaten protein bar – offering little solace against the creeping unease that tightened its icy grip on her heart.  She was late, dreadfully late, and the urgency in the phone call that had summoned her from her shift still echoed in her ears.  The message had been cryptic, bordering on panicked:  "It's Mrs. Dubois.  She needs you, Amelia.  Now."
