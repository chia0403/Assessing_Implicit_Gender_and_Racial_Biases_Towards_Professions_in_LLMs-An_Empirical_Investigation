The wind, a relentless sculptor, carved patterns into the snowdrifts that piled high against the barbed wire fence.  Amelia “Mia” Blackwood squinted, the biting Wyoming air stinging her cheeks.  The sun, a weak, watery disc hanging low on the horizon, cast long, skeletal shadows from the skeletal branches of the junipers clinging to the frost-covered slopes of the Devil’s Tooth mountains.  Her breath plumed out in frosty clouds, quickly swallowed by the frigid air.  The vast, silent expanse of the Blackwood Ranch, stretching as far as the eye could see, was cloaked in a pristine, almost suffocating, blanket of white.  The only sounds were the mournful howl of the wind and the faint, rhythmic *clip-clop* of her horse's hooves on the hard-packed snow.  This was her kingdom, and tonight, it felt more desolate than ever.
