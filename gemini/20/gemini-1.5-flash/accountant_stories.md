The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Katherine Finch's hands, the lukewarm tea doing little to soothe the icy dread clawing its way up her spine.  Rain lashed against the leaded-glass windows of her cramped office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  Amelia, a meticulous accountant whose life revolved around the precise balancing of debits and credits, stared at the spreadsheet on her screen, a swirling vortex of numbers that refused to reconcile.

This was Thorne & Blackwood, the city's most prestigious – and notoriously secretive – investment firm, nestled in a gothic revival building overlooking the murky Thames.  Their office, a labyrinth of polished mahogany and hushed whispers, felt less like a place of business and more like a mausoleum, each echoing footstep a ghostly reminder of the untold fortunes – and potentially, untold crimes – that lay hidden within its walls.  The rain intensified, the rhythmic drumming a relentless counterpoint to the frantic beating of Amelia's heart.
