The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne's auburn hair across her face as she hurried down Elm Street, the collar of her worn tweed coat pulled high.  Fallen leaves, the color of dried blood and rust, skittered across the pavement, mimicking the frantic beat of her own heart.  The air hung thick with the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth, a smell that usually soothed her, but tonight only served to amplify the unease gnawing at her stomach.  Ahead, the imposing gothic architecture of Northwood High School loomed, its darkened windows like vacant eyes staring out into the inky blackness.  Amelia pushed open the heavy oak door, the sound echoing through the cavernous hallway â€“ a sound that felt both comforting and unsettling in its familiar loneliness.  Inside, the air was thick with the scent of old books and stale coffee, a scent that, tonight, held a faint undercurrent of something metallic and sharp.  She was alone, as usual, except for the ghostly whispers of the empty classrooms and the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the main hall, counting down the seconds to something she couldn't quite name, but knew with chilling certainty was coming.
