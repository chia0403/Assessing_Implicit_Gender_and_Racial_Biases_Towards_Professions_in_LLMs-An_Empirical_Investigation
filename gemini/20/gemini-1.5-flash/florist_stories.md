The scent of lilies, heady and sweet, hung heavy in the air, mingling with the earthy perfume of damp soil and the sharp tang of pine needles scattered across the worn wooden floorboards of "Petals & Promises."  Rain lashed against the leaded glass windows of the shop, blurring the already fading light of a late November afternoon.  Inside, amongst overflowing vases and baskets bursting with autumnal hues, Amelia Hawthorne, her fingers stained a delicate shade of burgundy from handling deep crimson roses, carefully arranged a spray of heather and bittersweet.  The bell above the door jingled a discordant counterpoint to the rhythmic drumming of the rain, a sound that, for Amelia, usually signified a welcome distraction from the quiet solitude she often cherished.  But tonight, the silence felt different, heavier, almost expectant.
