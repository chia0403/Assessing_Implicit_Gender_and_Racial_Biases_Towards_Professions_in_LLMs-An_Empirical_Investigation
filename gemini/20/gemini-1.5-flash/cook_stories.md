The salt spray stung Amelia Hernandez's face as she wrestled the stubborn fishing net onto the deck of the *Sea Serpent*.  The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum in the sky, cast long shadows across the chaotic scene: a jumble of writhing mackerel, the rhythmic clang of buckets, and the pungent aroma of brine and fish guts that permeated everything on the tiny, bobbing trawler.  Amelia, her flour-dusted apron clinging to her damp clothes, surveyed the catch with a practiced eye, her mind already calculating the evening's menu for the Salty Siren, the ramshackle tavern she owned and operated on the windswept island of Isla Perdida.  The air, thick with the promise of a brewing storm, carried the distant, mournful cry of gulls â€“ a sound as familiar to Amelia as the rhythmic chopping of her own knife.
