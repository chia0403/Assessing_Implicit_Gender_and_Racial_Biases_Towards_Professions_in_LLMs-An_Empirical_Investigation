The remote cabin, barely visible through the swirling white chaos, was perched precariously on the edge of a frozen lake, its single flickering light a fragile beacon against the encroaching darkness. This was no ordinary call; this was a fight against both nature and time.  Amelia, a paramedic with the Alaskan State Emergency Medical Services, knew this night could be the difference between life and death.
