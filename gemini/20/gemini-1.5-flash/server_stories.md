The chipped Formica tabletop felt clammy beneath Amelia Hernandez's fingertips.  The fluorescent lights of the "Rusty Mug Diner" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the perpetual clatter of cutlery and the low thrum of conversation that never quite rose above a tired murmur.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the already indistinct view of the deserted highway outside.  Amelia, wiping down the counter with a rag that had seen better decades, sighed.  Another slow Tuesday night at the Rusty Mug.  The only company she had was the perpetually flickering neon sign outside, promising "Coffee, Pies, and Comfort" â€“ a promise that felt increasingly hollow with each passing hour.
