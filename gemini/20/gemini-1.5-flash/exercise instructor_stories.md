The pre-dawn chill bit at Amelia “Mia” Hernandez’s cheeks as she unlocked the glass doors of “Body & Soul Fitness.”  The street outside, usually a cacophony of honking taxis and rumbling buses, was still and hushed, the only sound the rhythmic swish of street cleaners’ brooms echoing faintly down the avenue.  Mia shivered, pulling her thick, navy blue fleece tighter around her.  Inside, the studio was a haven of controlled warmth, the air already thick with the scent of lemon-scented cleaning solution and the faint, lingering musk of sweat from yesterday’s Zumba class.  Rows of gleaming treadmills stood sentinel, their digital displays blinking in the dim light, waiting for the onslaught of the morning’s fitness fanatics.  A single, bare bulb illuminated the mirrored wall, reflecting Mia's own tired but determined face back at her. Today was going to be a big day; not only was it the launch of her new, highly anticipated “Sculpt & Strengthen” program, but also the day she hoped to finally convince Mr. Henderson, the notoriously tight-fisted building owner, to invest in some much-needed new equipment.
