The chipped paint of Mrs. Eleanor Vance's classroom desk, a pale, peeling yellow that mirrored the sickly hue of the November sky outside, felt strangely comforting under her fingertips.  Rain lashed against the single, dusty window, a relentless drumming that echoed the frantic rhythm of her own heart.  Oakwood Elementary School, nestled in the sleepy, forgotten corner of Havenwood, usually hummed with a cheerful, chaotic energy. Today, however, a thick blanket of silence, broken only by the rhythmic *thwack-thwack-thwack* of the rain, had settled over the usually vibrant space.  The scent of old paper, chalk dust, and something faintly metallic – the lingering aroma of a particularly enthusiastic science experiment gone slightly wrong – hung heavy in the air.  Eleanor, usually a beacon of organised calm, felt a knot of unease tighten in her stomach. Something was profoundly wrong.  The annual Harvest Festival, usually a source of joyous pandemonium, was just hours away, and the usually bustling preparations had been… strangely absent.
