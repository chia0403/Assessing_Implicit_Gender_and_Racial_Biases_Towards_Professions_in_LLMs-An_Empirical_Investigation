The chipped paint of the "Sunshine Smiles Daycare" sign flaked onto the already overflowing overflowing recycling bin, mirroring the slow decay of Penelope "Penny" Abigail Hawthorne's optimism.  It was a Tuesday, which usually meant a chaotic symphony of tiny tantrums and sticky fingers, but today, the usual pre-school pandemonium was muted, replaced by an unnerving silence.  The normally vibrant yellow walls seemed to have dulled, their cheerful murals of cartoon animals now appearing slightly sinister in the dim, pre-dawn light filtering through the grimy windows.  Penny, bundled in a thick cardigan despite the late spring heat, shivered, not entirely from the chill of the air.  Something felt wrong, profoundly and unsettlingly wrong, in the usually chaotic haven of Sunshine Smiles.
