The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face as he hauled the last length of seasoned oak onto the rickety wharf.  Seagulls shrieked overhead, their cries a mournful counterpoint to the creak and groan of the ancient timbers beneath his worn boots.  The air, thick with the smell of brine and drying fish, carried the faint, sweeter scent of pine from the lumber piled high beside him – a comforting aroma familiar to Elias since his apprenticeship days in the bustling port town of Oakhaven.  Oakhaven itself clung precariously to the cliffs overlooking the churning grey expanse of the North Sea, its cobbled streets a labyrinth of narrow passageways and half-timbered houses that seemed to lean drunkenly towards the ever-present threat of the waves.  The setting sun cast long, skeletal shadows across the harbour, painting the scene in hues of bruised purple and fading gold.  This was Elias’s world, a world built of wood, salt, and the relentless rhythm of the tides.
