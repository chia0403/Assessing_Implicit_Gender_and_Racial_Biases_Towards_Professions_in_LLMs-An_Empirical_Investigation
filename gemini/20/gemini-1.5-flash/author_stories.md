The salt spray stung Amelia Katherine “Mel” Holloway’s face as she wrestled the stubborn mainsail.  The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum sinking into the churning grey Atlantic, cast long, skeletal shadows across the deck of the *Sea Serpent*.  The air, thick with the smell of brine and diesel, vibrated with the rhythmic groan of the ageing hull.  Mel, her usually meticulously styled auburn hair escaping its braid in wild tendrils, gripped the rope tighter, her knuckles white against the weathered hemp.  She hadn't expected her research trip to the remote Blasket Islands – a quest for inspiration for her next historical fiction novel about a 17th-century shipwreck – to involve quite so much hands-on sailing.  But then, nothing about this trip had gone quite to plan.  The charming, if slightly unreliable, Captain Finnigan had assured her the *Sea Serpent* was "sturdy as an old oak."  Mel was starting to suspect the oak in question might have been riddled with termites.
