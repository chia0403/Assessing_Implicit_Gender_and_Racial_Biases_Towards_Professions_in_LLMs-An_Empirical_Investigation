The chipped paint of the "Welcome to Ms. Eleanor Vance's Classroom!" sign flaked onto the vibrant, slightly sticky, floor like a confetti of faded optimism.  It was a fitting metaphor for Eleanor Vance’s current mood.  Dust motes danced in the late afternoon sunbeams slicing through the grimy windows of Room 2B at Willow Creek Elementary, illuminating a chaotic landscape of overturned miniature chairs, half-finished crayon masterpieces, and a distinctly suspicious puddle near the block corner.  The air hung thick with the scent of dried glue, overripe bananas, and the faint, lingering aroma of a mysterious spill that Eleanor suspected, with a weary sigh, involved grape juice and something… else.  This was, to put it mildly, not the serene, idyllic classroom she’d envisioned when she’d embarked on her teaching career five years ago.  But then again, no kindergarten classroom ever truly was.
