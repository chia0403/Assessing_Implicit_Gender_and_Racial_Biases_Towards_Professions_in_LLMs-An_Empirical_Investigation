The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Mia” Hawthorne’s auburn hair across her face as she surveyed the crumbling façade of the Grand Majestic Theatre.  Dust motes, illuminated by the weak streetlamp, danced in the swirling air like disgruntled spirits.  Years of neglect had etched themselves onto the building's once-proud brickwork; chipped paint flaked like decaying skin, and boarded-up windows stared out like vacant eyes.  Inside, Mia knew, the situation was far worse.  It wasn’t just the peeling plaster and collapsing ceilings; it was the suffocating silence, the absence of laughter and applause, the ghost of a thousand forgotten performances that chilled her to the bone.  This, however, was her canvas.  This decaying monument to forgotten grandeur was where Mia intended to paint her masterpiece: a revival of "The Raven's Shadow," a rarely performed gothic masterpiece she’d been obsessed with since she was a child clutching a tattered copy in her grandmother's attic.
