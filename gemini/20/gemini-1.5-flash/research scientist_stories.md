The biting Antarctic wind howled a mournful song, whipping snow into a frenzy around Dr. Aris Thorne’s research station.  Ice crystals, sharp as shards of glass, stung his exposed skin despite the multiple layers of thermal gear.  The air itself felt brittle, a fragile membrane stretched taut over the unforgiving, ancient landscape.  Aris, hunched against the gale, adjusted the thermal goggles on his face, his breath misting in the frigid air.  The Vostok Station, a lonely outpost perched on the highest point of the Antarctic plateau, felt a million miles from civilization, a fitting location for the research that consumed him: the investigation of a mysterious, subsurface anomaly detected deep beneath the ice.  A discovery that threatened to rewrite everything he thought he knew about Earth’s history, and possibly, its future.
