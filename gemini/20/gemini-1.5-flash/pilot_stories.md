The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful song around Captain Evelyn "Evie" Reed's battered Cessna 185, the sound swallowed by the even louder roar of the engine.  Below, the Chugach Mountains clawed at the bruised, twilight sky, their snow-covered peaks jagged teeth against the fading light.  Evie squinted through the frosted cockpit window, her breath fogging the already limited visibility.  The radio crackled with static, a mocking counterpoint to the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the propellor battling the increasingly ferocious wind.  Tonight, the unforgiving wilderness of the Alaskan interior felt less like a challenge and more like a hungry beast, waiting to swallow her whole.
