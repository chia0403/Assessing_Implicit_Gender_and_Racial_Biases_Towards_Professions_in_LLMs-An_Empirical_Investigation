The antiseptic tang of chlorhexidine clung to Dr. Anya Petrova like a second skin.  Sunlight, fractured by the stained-glass window of Dr. Petrova's small, slightly-dilapidated dental practice in the heart of the perpetually overcast town of Alderwood, cast long shadows across the waiting room.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of light, illuminating a chipped porcelain doll, its painted eyes staring blankly at the chipped paint on the wall.  A rhythmic thump-thump-thump echoed from the back, a soundtrack to the day's anxieties and whispered hopes.  It was Tuesday.  Anya, accustomed to the predictable monotony of fillings and extractions, felt a prickle of unease, a feeling as sharp as a new drill bit.  This was no ordinary Tuesday. This Tuesday, she was about to face a patient who might just shatter the quiet normalcy of her life, and Alderwood with it.
