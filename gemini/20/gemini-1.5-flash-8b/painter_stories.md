The chipped paint of the gallery wall, a muted symphony of greys and faded blues, reflected the swirling storm clouds gathering outside the window of "The Painted Palette."  Rain lashed against the glass, a relentless drumming that mirrored the frantic brushstrokes visible through the slightly ajar door.  Inside, Amelia Blackwood, a painter known for her vibrant depictions of urban decay, hunched over her easel, her brow furrowed in concentration.  The air hung thick with the scent of turpentine and the faint, metallic tang of desperation.  The gallery, normally buzzing with the hushed chatter of art enthusiasts, was eerily silent.


Setting:

The Painted Palette was a small, intimate gallery tucked away on a side street of the sprawling, industrial city of Ashwood.  Grey skies perpetually hung low over the concrete canyons, mirroring the muted palettes that Amelia often used.  Ashwood, a city of towering skyscrapers and decaying tenements, housed a vibrant, yet often overlooked, art scene. The cityâ€™s rough edges, its grit and its beauty, were the inspiration for Amelia's paintings.
