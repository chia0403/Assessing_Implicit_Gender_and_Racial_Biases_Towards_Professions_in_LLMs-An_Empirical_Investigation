Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the dilapidated detective agency, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic rhythm of Amelia "Ace" Cavendish's thoughts.  The flickering neon sign of "Ace's Investigations" cast an eerie, sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked alley, highlighting the grime-caked brick walls and the overflowing dumpster behind.  This, the heart of the back alleys of Blackwood, was Amelia's kingdomâ€”or, more accurately, her battlefield.

The air hung heavy with the smell of coal dust and frying onions, a perpetual haze obscuring the already hazy memories of a case that refused to fade.  It was a place where whispers followed you like shadows, and secrets festered in the damp earth.  The cobbled streets, treacherous under a constant film of rain or dust, held the ghosts of untold stories, their echoes carried on the wind like mournful cries.  Amelia, with her trench coat draped over her shoulders and a weariness etched into her jawline, found the city as familiar and threatening as her own reflection.  Tonight, Blackwood was about to reveal another one of its dark secrets.
