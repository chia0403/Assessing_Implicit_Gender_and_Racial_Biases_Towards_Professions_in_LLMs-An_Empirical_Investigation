The fluorescent lights of the interrogation room hummed, a monotonous counterpoint to the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Dr. Eleanor Vance's heart.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom, illuminating the chipped Formica table where Detective Miller sat, his face etched with exhaustion.  Across from them, a young woman, barely older than Eleanor's own daughter, stared straight ahead, her expression blank, almost devoid of life. Her name, the detective muttered, was  Anya Petrova.

The room itself, a concrete box on the second floor of the precinct, smelled faintly of antiseptic and stale coffee.  The faded police-barge wallpaper, once meant to inspire order and calm, now seemed to mock the chaos swirling within.  Eleanor, her tailored suit a stark contrast to the drab surroundings, traced a pattern on the linoleum floor with the toe of her shoe.  The case was a complex one, interwoven with elements of paranoia, dissociation, and a disturbing pattern of increasingly violent behaviour that hinted at a deeper, more insidious psychological disturbance.  Tonight, she had to untangle the threads of Anya's fractured mind and discover the truth behind her actions.  Her task, as always, was fraught with the delicate balance between professional detachment and a human desire to help.
