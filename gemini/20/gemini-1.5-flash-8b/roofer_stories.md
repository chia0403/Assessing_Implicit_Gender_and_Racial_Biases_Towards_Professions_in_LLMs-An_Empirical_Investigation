The biting wind whipped at Elias Thorne's worn leather jacket, stinging his cheeks and rattling the loose shingles on the dilapidated Victorian mansion roof.  Below, the city of Ashwood sprawled, a tapestry of flickering streetlights and towering, glass-encased skyscrapers that seemed to mock the humble, wooden shingles he repaired.  Ashwood was a city of contrasts, a place where opulence met decay, where the glittering facades of the wealthy hid the crumbling foundations of the poor. Elias, with his calloused hands and weathered face, was a silent witness to both. He'd been patching and patching roofs like this one for fifteen years, each repair a small act of defiance against the relentless march of time and neglect.  This particular roof, the ornate crest on its peak now barely more than a faded whisper, seemed to pulse with a silent sorrow, a story of forgotten grandeur Elias knew he would never fully understand.  Today, however, the story was about the leak.  A persistent, dripping drip that was threatening to undermine the entire structure.  Elias hunched deeper into his protective gear, the familiar smell of damp wood and old plaster filling his lungs. He knew this wouldn't be an easy fix.
