The fluorescent lights of the Blackwood Manor hummed a monotonous tune, a lullaby to the dust motes dancing in the single shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grime-coated windows.  Elias Blackwood, a man whose face bore the same weary stamp as the worn linoleum he swept, adjusted the strap of his worn canvas satchel.  Dust devils, stirred by his brush, danced around his ankles.  He was Elias Blackwood, Jr., and, despite the gilded name, his life was as dusty and unassuming as the grand, decaying mansion he maintained.


The Blackwood Manor, a sprawling gothic edifice that seemed to swallow the surrounding countryside whole, stood as a monument to forgotten fortunes and even more forgotten dreams.  Grey stone, weathered and stained with the passage of centuries, clung to the looming silhouette of the mansion.  Ivy, thick as knotted fingers, clawed at the walls, clinging to the faded grandeur.  The once-vibrant colours of the stained-glass windows were now muted, their glory faded like the memory of a forgotten banquet.  Rain lashed against the creaking eaves, each drop a miniature hammer chipping away at the house's already fragile fa√ßade. Inside, the echoes of laughter and music had long since died, replaced by the quiet rustle of dust and the occasional drip of water.  Elias moved through this echoing emptiness, a silent guardian in the crumbling kingdom of his family's past.
