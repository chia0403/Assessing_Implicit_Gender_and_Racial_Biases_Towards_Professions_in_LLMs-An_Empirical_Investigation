The chipped paint on the cab of the "Iron Horse," a 1998 Kenworth T800, reflected the sickly yellow light of the rising sun, casting long, skeletal shadows across the dusty Interstate 80.  Dust, fine and relentless, coated everythingâ€”the cracked asphalt, the weathered billboards advertising used farm equipment, and the weathered face of Elias "Hawk" Hawkridge.  Hawk, a trucker with eyes the color of faded amethyst and a jawline carved by sun and wind, gripped the worn steering wheel, his calloused hands tracing the familiar grooves.  The rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the engine was his constant companion, a metronome keeping time with the relentless stretch of highway that seemed to stretch endlessly between him and the destination he'd been chasing for the past three weeks: the remote, backwoods town of Harmony Creek, where his estranged sister, Elara, lived in a house rumored to be haunted by the restless spirits of the past.
