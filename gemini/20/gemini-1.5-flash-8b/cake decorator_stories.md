The flickering neon sign of "Sugarplum Dreams" cast a sickly sweet glow over the rain-slicked cobblestones of Old Market Square.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron awning, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic rhythm of Amelia Butterfield's hands as she meticulously piped frosting.  Amelia, a young woman with eyes the colour of molten caramel and a smile that could melt glaciers, was a cake decorator of unparalleled skill, though her tiny, cluttered shop seemed more like a haven of frantic chaos than a showcase of sugary artistry.  Inside, the air hummed with the rhythmic whir of her electric mixer, the delicate clinking of cake pans, and the faint, sweet scent of vanilla and buttercream.  A single, flickering fluorescent light bulb cast long shadows across the rows of colourful icing bottles, highlighting the intricate designs Amelia was painstakingly crafting on a miniature wedding cake.
