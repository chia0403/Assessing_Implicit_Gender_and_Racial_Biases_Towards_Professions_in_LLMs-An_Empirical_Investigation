The chipped Formica counter gleamed under the harsh fluorescent lights of the Grand Zenith Hotel, reflecting the perpetual grime of a thousand hurried hands.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight that pierced the gloom, illuminating a tiny, almost invisible, speck of something metallic clinging to the corner of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's worn-out uniform jacket.  Barty, a bell hop of the Grand Zenith for the past three years, sighed, the sound barely audible above the rhythmic clatter of luggage carts and the muffled shouts of a gaggle of tourists.  He was, to put it mildly, bored.


The Grand Zenith, a sprawling edifice of faded grandeur, stood sentinel over the bustling metropolis of Neo-Veridian.  Its imposing facade, once gleaming white marble, now bore the scars of countless years and countless indifferent eyes.  Inside, the opulent lobby, with its towering chandeliers and plush armchairs, whispered of a time long past, a time when whispered secrets and clandestine meetings took place amidst the hushed elegance. Now, the whispers were mostly the complaints of irate guests and the clinking of coins.  The city itself, a vibrant tapestry of towering glass skyscrapers and winding alleyways, seemed to hum with an energy that felt utterly detached from the hotelâ€™s dusty, fading glory.
