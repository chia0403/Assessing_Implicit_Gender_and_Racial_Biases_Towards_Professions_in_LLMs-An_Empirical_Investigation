The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the worn mahogany desk of Judge Alistair Finch, QC.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single bulb, swirled in the humid air of the courtroom.  Outside, the rain hammered against the leaded panes of the Victorian courthouse, a relentless rhythm that mirrored the relentless arguments unfolding within.  A chill, not just from the weather, but from the pervasive sense of injustice, seeped into the very bones of the room.  This was the Court of Assizes in Grimsby, 1887, a town notorious for its seafaring traditions and its equally notorious underbelly of smugglers, dockworkers, and the desperate.  Judge Alistair Finch, a man whose sharp intellect was only matched by his unwavering sense of propriety, found himself wrestling with a case that threatened to unravel the fragile social fabric of the town.  A young woman, accused of petty theft, was being relentlessly pursued by a corrupt merchant, a man with connections to the city's powerful and wealthy.  The whispers in the courtroom gallery spoke of more than just stolen goods; they spoke of vengeance, of class war, and the unspoken rules that governed the lives of the downtrodden.
