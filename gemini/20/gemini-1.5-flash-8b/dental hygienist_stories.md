The fluorescent lights of Dr. Anya Petrova's office hummed, a relentless counterpoint to the soft click-clack of Amelia Hayesâ€™s instruments.  Amelia, a dental hygienist with a perpetually tired but determined expression, meticulously cleaned a patient's teeth, the rhythmic scrape of the scaler a soothing, almost hypnotic, sound.  Outside, the relentless summer heat of the bustling city of New Verona pressed against the narrow, sun-drenched storefront, a stark contrast to the cool, clinical interior.  The air, thick with the faint smells of antiseptic and mint, was punctuated by the occasional whiff of freshly brewed coffee from the nearby cafe.  Amelia, a woman of thirty-two with the kind of quiet strength that simmered beneath a calm exterior, felt the familiar tug of frustration. Another perfect score. Another patient who seemed more interested in the latest gossip on the local news channel than the crucial steps in maintaining dental health.


The setting: A small, but well-regarded dental office tucked away on a bustling side street in the heart of New Verona, a sprawling city known for its vibrant nightlife and relentless pace.  The cramped, but clean, office was a microcosm of the city itself: a constant struggle for space and attention in a crowded urban landscape.
