The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Coil," a dilapidated repair shop crammed into a forgotten alleyway, cast a sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked cobblestones.  Inside, amidst the cacophony of buzzing transformers and the rhythmic click-clack of soldering irons,  Amelia "Ames"  Rivera, a radio technician with hands as nimble as hummingbirds' wings, wrestled with a sputtering vintage shortwave receiver.
