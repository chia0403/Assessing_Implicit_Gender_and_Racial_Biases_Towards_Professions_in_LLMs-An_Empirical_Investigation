Carter," felt almost absurdly formal against the chaotic backdrop.  The terminal was a maelstrom of frustrated travelers, lost luggage, and the incessant beep of electronic systems. Amy, a flight attendant for "Azure Skies Airlines," was the quiet storm at the heart of it all. Her assigned flight, the 11:45 to Bali, was now an hour and a half late.
