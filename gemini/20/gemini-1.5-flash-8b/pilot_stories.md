The biting wind, a razor-sharp shriek against Amelia "Amy"  Fairweather's face, whipped across the desolate expanse of the Great Basin.  Dust devils, swirling miniature tornadoes, danced across the cracked earth, mimicking the frantic thump-thump-thump of her heart against her ribs.  Below, the jagged peaks of the Sierra Nevada, shrouded in a perpetual twilight, looked like teeth clenched in a silent, ancient growl. Amy, co-pilot of the experimental Zephyr 7, felt the shuddering of the aircraft beneath her as the antiquated propellers strained against the unforgiving air.  This wasn't the smooth, predictable ascent of a commercial flight. This was the brutal, unforgiving embrace of the untamed frontier of the sky, a place where whispers of legend mingled with the roar of the wind.  The desert, a vast, unforgiving canvas, stretched out for miles, punctuated only by the occasional skeletal remains of a forgotten mining town.  Her destination: Mount Everest. Not to climb it, not to conquer it, but to deliver a crucial cargo under the cover of darkness, a cargo that could change the fate of the world.
