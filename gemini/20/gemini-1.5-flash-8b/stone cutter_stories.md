The biting wind, a razor-sharp whisper against the skeletal frame of the quarry, whipped dust and splinters of granite into Elara Stonehand's eyes.  Sunlight, fractured and pale, struggled to pierce the swirling grey, illuminating only the jagged peaks of the mountain that housed the ancient workings of the Stonehaven Quarry.  For fifty years, Elara Stonehand had carved and chipped, honed and shaped the heart of this mountain.  Her hands, calloused and scarred like ancient maps, trembled slightly, but her eyes, the colour of polished obsidian, held the unwavering focus of a sculptor facing a formidable block.  Today, however, the mountain seemed to press down on her with an almost suffocating weight, a weight that mirrored the heavy burden in her heart.

The quarry, a labyrinth of tunnels and exposed faces, echoed with the rhythmic clang of her hammer against the stone.  Dust devils danced in the shafts of light, illuminating the intricate network of grooves and chisels that spoke of generations of stone workers before her.  Once, the quarry had bustled with a lively community, each artisan pouring their skill and artistry into their creations.  Now, only the distant drone of the machinery, the grinding of the stone-crushers, and the occasional, hollow echo of Elaraâ€™s hammer broke the silence.  The once vibrant heart of the community felt worn, cold, and hollow.  Elara was the last of the true stone cutters, the last guardian of a dying tradition.
