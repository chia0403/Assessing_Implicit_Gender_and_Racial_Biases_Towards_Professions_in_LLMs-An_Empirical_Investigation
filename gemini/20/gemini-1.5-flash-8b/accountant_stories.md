The chipped Formica countertop gleamed under the fluorescent hum of the office, reflecting the perpetual twilight of a mid-October London afternoon.  Rain hammered against the grimy windows of 142 High Street, a rhythmic counterpoint to the incessant clicking of Elias Thorne's keyboard.  Elias Thorne, CPA, stared at the spreadsheet, rows of numbers blurring into a meaningless grey.  He was an accountant, yes, but lately, the numbers whispered tales not of profit and loss, but of something darker, something profoundly unsettling.


Setting: A small, cramped, and somewhat dilapidated accounting office on a bustling, yet slightly depressing, high street in London, England.  The office, while functional, lacked the modern amenities of larger firms, a testament to its long-standing history. The grey and muted tones of the d√©cor further emphasized the oppressive, though practical, nature of the environment.  The incessant drumming of rain against the windows created a constant, almost suffocating background noise.
