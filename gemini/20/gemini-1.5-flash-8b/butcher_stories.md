The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual, unsettling grey-green from years of butchered meat, mirrored the gloom of the back room.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Bartholomew "Barty" Grimshaw's small, family-run butcher shop, a relentless percussion against the rhythmic clang of cleavers and the low, guttural grunts of Barty himself as he expertly carved a leg of lamb.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon light piercing the gloom, illuminating the glistening surface of the slab where the lamb lay, its ivory-white flesh a stark contrast to the crimson smear that clung to the surrounding butcher's steel.  Barty, a man weathered like the ancient oak outside his window, concentrated on his task, his hands, calloused and scarred, moving with a practiced grace that belied the relentless ache in his shoulders.  Outside, the wind howled, whipping the already-tangled roots of the ancient oak against the brick walls of the shop, an eerie counterpoint to the quiet hum of the shop.  The year was 1938, and the air, thick with the scent of brine and rosemary, felt heavy with the approaching storm.
