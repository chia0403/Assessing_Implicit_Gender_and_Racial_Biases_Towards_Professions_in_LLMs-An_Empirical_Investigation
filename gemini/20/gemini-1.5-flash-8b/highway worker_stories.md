The biting wind, a constant companion on the desolate stretch of highway 12, whipped at Amelia Stone's weathered face.  Dust, a fine grey powder, coated everythingâ€”her worn work boots, the faded orange vest clinging to her skeletal frame, and the cracked asphalt beneath her feet.  The sun, a pale disc sinking towards the jagged peaks of the Sierra Nevada, cast long, skeletal shadows across the endless expanse of two-lane highway.  This was Amelia's kingdom, her domain, the stretch of road between Bishop and the Eastern Sierra.  She was a highway worker, a nomad of asphalt, and today, as always, the only sound that truly mattered was the rhythmic thump of her jackhammer.  Today, however, something felt different.  A low, guttural growl, like the rumble of an ancient beast awakening, echoed in the canyon beyond the highway.
