Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the "Grand Victorian," its rhythmic drumming a relentless counterpoint to the frantic tapping of Amelia Hawthorne's fingers on the mahogany desk.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon light slicing through the gloom.  Amelia, a real estate agent with a perpetually rumpled blazer and a determined set to her jaw, surveyed the room.  The grandeur promised by the estate's name was long gone, replaced by the muted whispers of neglect.  Water stains marred the pristine white marble fireplace, and cobwebs draped like ghostly shrouds across the ornate plasterwork.  This was the "Grand" Victorian in all its dilapidated glory, and Amelia, despite the increasingly insistent pit in her stomach, knew this was where her future, and possibly her sanity, hung in the balance.

The setting:  A fading, once-magnificent Victorian mansion, tucked away on a secluded street in the decaying heart of the city.  The neighborhood, once a hub of bustling prosperity, now whispered tales of lost fortunes and forgotten dreams, a stark contrast to the gleaming skyscrapers that clawed at the sky on the city's periphery.  The air itself seemed to hold a heavy, damp sadness, a tangible echo of the house's troubled past.
