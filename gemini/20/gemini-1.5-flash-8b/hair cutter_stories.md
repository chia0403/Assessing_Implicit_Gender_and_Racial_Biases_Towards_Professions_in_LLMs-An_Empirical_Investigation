The chipped porcelain sink, stained a dull, milky yellow from years of spilled chamomile tea and the inevitable errant streaks of crimson, reflected Elias Thorne's weary face.  He traced the faded floral pattern on the countertop with a calloused finger, the faint scent of lavender and ozone clinging to the air.  His small, cluttered barbershop, "The Clipper's Curl," situated on a quiet side street in the heart of Old Oakhaven, was a haven of whispers and muted conversations.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight slicing through the grime-coated window, illuminating the faded posters of 1920s flapper hairstyles and the slightly askew portrait of a rather stern-looking poodle.  Elias, a man whose own hair was a perpetually unruly mop of dark brown, sighed. Another Tuesday. Another day of listening to the anxieties and triumphs of his clients, all while attempting to tame their tresses.
