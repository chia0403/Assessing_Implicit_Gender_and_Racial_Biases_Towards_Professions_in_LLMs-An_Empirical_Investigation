The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked cobblestones outside.  Inside, the air hung thick with the smells of stale beer, woodsmoke, and something vaguely floral â€“ a persistent perfume that seemed to emanate from Elara Blackwood herself.  She was a creature of shadows in the dim tavern, her long, dark hair escaping from the tight braid that kept it contained, falling like a cloak around her shoulders.  Elara, twenty-eight years old, expertly poured a stout into a chipped mug, her movements practiced and precise.  The clinking of glasses, the muffled murmur of conversations, and the rhythmic thump of a lone musician's drum formed the soundtrack to her solitary vigil. Tonight, the Rusty Mug felt emptier than usual, a hollow echo of the boisterous gatherings that once filled its narrow space.  The city of Aethelgard, usually a symphony of activity, felt strangely still, the silence amplifying the nervous twitch of Elara's hand as she wiped down the bar.
