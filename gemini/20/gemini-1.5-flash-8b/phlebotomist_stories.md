The fluorescent hum of the clinic, a constant, low thrumming, was the only sound that truly registered in Amelia Hawthorne's awareness.  Sunlight, fractured and distorted by the grimy windowpanes of the city-centre Community Health Centre, cast long, skeletal shadows across the sterile white walls.

Amelia, her name a whisper against the ambient noise, meticulously swabbed a patient's arm.  Each movement was precise, practiced.  Five years as a phlebotomist had honed her into a machine, a conduit between human life and the cold, clinical reality of the lab.  Today, however, the rhythm was off-kilter.  Something was different about the quiet.
