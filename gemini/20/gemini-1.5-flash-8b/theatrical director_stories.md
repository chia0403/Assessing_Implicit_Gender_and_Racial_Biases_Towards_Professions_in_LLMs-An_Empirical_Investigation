The chipped paint of the "Grand Guignol" theatre, peeling like sunburnt skin on a forgotten face, reflected the flickering gaslight.  Dust motes danced in the air, illuminated by the single bare bulb hanging precariously from the ceiling, casting long, theatrical shadows across the cavernous space.  This was the domain of Isolde Nightingale, a woman whose lifeblood was the drama, the passion, the potent whispers of stories yet untold.  Isolde Nightingale, director of the Grand Guignol, a theatre steeped in the macabre, lived and breathed its faded grandeur, a woman whose eyes, though usually filled with an almost fierce, theatrical fire, held a peculiar, melancholic glint tonight.  Tonight, a new play was to be born, or perhaps, reborn.  The play, whispers said, was the most terrifying, the most breathtaking, the mostâ€¦impossible tale she had ever conceived.  The setting?  The dilapidated alleyways and shadowy corners of the city, a canvas painted in the grime of forgotten hopes and whispered fears.  The city, a character in its own right, a monstrous, lurking beast that breathed in the dark and slumbered beneath the city's decaying streets.
