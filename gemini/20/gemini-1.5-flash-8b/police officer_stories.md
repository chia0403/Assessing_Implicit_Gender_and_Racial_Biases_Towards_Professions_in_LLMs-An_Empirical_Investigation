The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains, carrying with it the scent of dust and something faintly metallic, like old blood.  Detective Isabella "Izzy" Diaz, her breath misting in the frigid air, scanned the parched landscape.  The rusted chassis of a pickup truck, half-buried in the loose earth, was the only visible sign of the accident.  A single, blood-stained glove, crimson against the ochre ground, lay abandoned nearby.  This wasn't the sun-drenched, bustling metropolis she was used to; this was the unforgiving, desolate backcountry of the Colorado panhandle, a place where secrets whispered on the wind and shadows stretched long into the twilight.  Izzy, clad in a worn, leather jacket that seemed to absorb the cold, felt a familiar knot of unease tighten in her stomach.  This was her kind of case.  The kind that smelled of desperation, where the victims spoke in whispers, and the truth was buried as deep as the skeletal remains of the past.  Today, her task wasn't just to solve a crime; it was to unravel a story lost to time.  The only clue, besides the glove, was the faint whisper of a name carried on the wind â€“  a name she knew she wouldn't forget:  Elias Thorne.
