The chipped paint of the Miss Abigail’s Kindergarten classroom, a faded pastel swirl of lavender and cream, whispered tales of countless scraped knees and whispered secrets. Sunlight, fractured by the stained-glass window depicting a joyous flock of birds, dappled the worn, wooden floor.  A symphony of tiny voices—a chorus of "Uh-oh's" and giggles, and the rhythmic thump-thump of tiny feet on the painted lines—filled the air.  This was the realm of  Eloise  Abernathy, a kindergarten teacher with eyes the color of warm honey and a heart brimming with the quiet confidence of a seasoned storyteller.  Today, however, the usual cacophony was muted, replaced by a low hum of anticipation.  It was the first day of spring, and something felt different, something more…magical.  A small, intricately carved wooden bird, nestled amongst the alphabet blocks, seemed to pulse with a subtle, almost imperceptible light.
