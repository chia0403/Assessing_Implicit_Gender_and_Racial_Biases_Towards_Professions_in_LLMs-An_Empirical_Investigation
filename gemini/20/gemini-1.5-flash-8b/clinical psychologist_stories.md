Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic rhythm in Dr. Amelia Hayes's chest.  The flickering fluorescent lights cast long, skeletal shadows across the cluttered office, highlighting the overflowing stacks of patient files and the half-eaten takeout containers nestled precariously on the edge of her desk.  The scent of stale coffee and antiseptic hung heavy in the air, a familiar aroma that usually offered a comforting sense of normalcy.  But tonight, it only amplified the suffocating weight of the case before her.

Amelia, a clinical psychologist with five years' experience, found herself staring at a single, handwritten note nestled amongst the paperwork.  The note, scrawled in a shaky, almost childlike hand, read simply: "I can't stop."

The setting:  A small, struggling clinic on the outskirts of a rapidly gentrifying city.  The clinic, once a hub for the working-class community, now found itself battling for its survival against the influx of newer, more upscale practices.  The neighborhood, once vibrant with a mix of cultures, was now transforming into a space that was increasingly out of reach for many of its original residents. This subtle shift in the social fabric of the community was becoming increasingly apparent in the nature of the patients Dr. Hayes was encountering.  A growing number were struggling with anxiety and depression, their roots seemingly embedded in this quiet transition.
