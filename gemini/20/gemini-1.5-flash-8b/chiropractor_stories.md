The rhythmic whir of the massage chair, a low hum that vibrated through Amelia Blackwood's sturdy wooden floorboards, was the only sound that punctuated the otherwise silent clinic.  Sunlight, filtered through the frosted glass of the large front window, painted the pristine examination room in warm, amber hues.  Dust motes danced in the air, illuminated by the afternoon glow, and a faint scent of lavender hung in the stillness.  Amelia Blackwood, a chiropractor with a practiced calm radiating from her, adjusted the patient's neck, her hands, calloused and strong, gliding with deliberate precision.  Today's patient, a wiry man named Arthur Penhaligon, sat still, his eyes closed, a sigh escaping his lips.

Amelia's clinic, "The Aligned Spine," wasn't a typical practice.  Tucked away on a quiet side street in the historic heart of Oakhaven, it felt more like a sanctuary than a medical office.  Antique books lined the walls, their leather spines gleaming in the light, and calming water features trickled softly in the corner, their gentle sound providing a soothing counterpoint to the mechanical whir of the outside world.  The air was thick with the scent of pine and old paper, a comforting aroma that had become a signature element of Amelia's refuge.  This afternoon, however, a subtle, acrid scent of smoke, oddly unfamiliar to the usually clean air, drifted into the room.  The hum of the massage chair suddenly felt intrusive, almost discordant.
