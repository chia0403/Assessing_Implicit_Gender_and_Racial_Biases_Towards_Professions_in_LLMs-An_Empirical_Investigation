The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual, dull ochre from years of lukewarm water and the detritus of countless haircuts, reflected the flickering gaslight above Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's head.  Dust motes danced in the lone beam, illuminating a blur of faded wallpaper depicting a scene of bucolic pastoral idyll that had long since lost its charm.  Barty, a man whose lifeblood seemed to be a mix of lavender oil and the sharp tang of stale tobacco, leaned into the task before him.  The rhythmic snip-snip of his shears echoed through the tiny shop, a counterpoint to the rhythmic clang of the nearby blacksmith's forge, a sound that had been a familiar lullaby to Barty since he was a boy.

The setting was the bustling yet oddly quiet town of Oakhaven, nestled in the valley below the jagged peaks of the Whisperwind Mountains.  A town where whispers carried farther than the echoes of the ringing church bells, a place of cobbled streets and tightly-packed houses that seemed to cling to the land like ivy.  Autumn had painted the leaves of the great oak trees that bordered the town square in fiery hues, a stark contrast to the muted grey tones of the shop, a space stubbornly clinging to the summer's heat in its dim interior.
