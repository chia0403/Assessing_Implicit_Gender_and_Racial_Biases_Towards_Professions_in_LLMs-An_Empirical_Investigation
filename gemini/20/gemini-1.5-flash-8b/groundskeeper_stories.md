The biting wind whipped across the manicured lawns of Blackwood Manor, tugging at Elias Thorne's threadbare wool jacket.  Grey clouds, like bruised plums, hung low over the sprawling estate, casting long, skeletal shadows across the meticulously kept rose gardens.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, carried the faint, almost imperceptible, aroma of something faintly sweet and sickly – like overripe figs and a hint of pine.  Elias, a groundskeeper for Blackwood Manor for the past twenty years, adjusted his worn gardening hat, the brim pulled low over his eyes.  He knew this particular scent.  It heralded the return of the mist, the same mist that had clung to the manor like a shroud for the last week.  And something else – something unsettling – felt different this time.
