The fluorescent lights of the "Apex Solutions" reception area hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Elara Nightingaleâ€™s workday.  The beige walls, slightly too pale, reflected the polished surface of the reception desk, gleaming under the harsh overhead lights.  A half-eaten granola bar, a crumpled napkin, and a stray stapler lay scattered amongst neatly arranged brochures and a overflowing recycling bin.  Elara, a wisp of a woman with eyes that held the quiet intensity of a storm gathering, adjusted the worn-out strap of her purse.  It was Tuesday, a day like any other, in the sterile world of corporate efficiency.  Outside, the city roared, a chaotic symphony of honking horns and distant sirens, a world completely oblivious to the quiet battles fought within the glass walls of Apex Solutions.
