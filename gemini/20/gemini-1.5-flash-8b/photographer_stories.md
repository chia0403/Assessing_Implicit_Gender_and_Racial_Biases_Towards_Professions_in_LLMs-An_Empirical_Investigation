The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's camera bag tighter around her waist, stinging her cheeks with icy shards of rain.  Grey skies, mirroring the overcast mood of the small coastal town of Oakhaven, pressed down on the weathered wooden pier.  Amelia, a photographer known for her evocative portraits of the sea and its people, crouched low, her lens trained on the churning grey expanse of the North Sea.  The rhythmic crashing of waves against the pilings was the only sound besides the relentless howl of the wind.  Oakhaven, a place of hushed secrets and whispered legends, felt particularly brooding today, draped in a cloak of melancholy.  This was her last assignment before the winter solstice, a portrait of the town's annual fishermen's festival.  Usually vibrant and full of boisterous life, today it feltâ€¦ hollow.  The air, thick with the salt spray, held an undercurrent of something else, something unsettling.  She adjusted the aperture, her breath fogging the lens.  A lone figure emerged from the storm clouds, a solitary figure clad in a heavy oilskin coat, walking towards the pier's edge.
