The fluorescent lights of the "Corner Convenience" hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia Thistlewick's life.  The air, thick with the smell of stale coffee, discounted candy, and the faint, cloying perfume of the woman who always bought a dozen roses on Tuesdays, felt stagnant.  Amelia, a cashier with a perpetual frown etched into her face despite her best efforts, watched the flickering digital clock on the counter.  3:57.  Another agonizingly slow minute before closing.  Her hands, stained a dull orange from the endless cycle of bagging chips and ringing up lottery tickets, ached.  The chipped paint on the counter, a faded shade of emerald green, seemed to mock her patience.

The Corner Convenience was a small, unassuming store nestled in the heart of the grey, industrial district.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight piercing the grime-coated windows, illuminating a jumble of overflowing shelves stocked with everything from expired mayonnaise to questionable novelty socks.  The aroma of frying onions, a staple of the late-night munchies, mingled with the lingering scent of rain-soaked asphalt, hinting at the city's ceaseless, grey heartbeat just beyond the store's battered plywood walls.  The only other sound, besides the relentless hum of the lights, was the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Ameliaâ€™s fingers on the worn keyboard, the soundtrack to her quiet, monotonous existence.
