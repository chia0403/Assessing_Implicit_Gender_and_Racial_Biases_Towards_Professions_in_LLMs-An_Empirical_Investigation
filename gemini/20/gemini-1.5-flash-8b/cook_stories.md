The aroma of roasting rosemary and sizzling duck hung heavy in the air, a fragrant curtain drawn around the tiny kitchen.  Sunlight, fractured by the stained-glass window depicting a celestial battle of angels and dragons, dappled the polished wooden counter where Amelia Josephine Nightingale meticulously arranged a scattering of fresh thyme sprigs.  The kitchen, tucked away on the second floor of the sprawling, ivy-covered manor house, whispered with the rustle of silk gowns and the murmur of unseen conversations.  Amelia, her apron tied tight around a waist that seemed to perpetually disappear into the folds of her voluminous sleeves, felt a familiar tremor in her hands.  Tonight, Lord Ashworth's grand dinner party was to take place, and Amelia, head cook and resident culinary artist of Blackwood Manor, felt the weight of expectation pressing down on her shoulders, heavier even than the roasting chicken nestled in the wicker basket.
