The fluorescent hum of the pharmacy, "Apothecary's Corner," was a constant, almost comforting drone.  Rain lashed against the shop's single, arched window, blurring the streetlights into streaks of amber.  Inside, Amelia Hawthorne, a pharmacist with a meticulous nature and eyes that held the quiet wisdom of a thousand well-preserved remedies, meticulously organized the shelves of cough drops and ointments.  The scent of lavender and pine, mingled with the faint, chemical tang of disinfectant, was the air she breathed, the symphony of her day.  Today, however, a discordant note was struck. A note of urgency, laced with a subtle, unsettling sweetness.

The setting:  A small, rain-swept town nestled in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains, Oregon.  Apothecary's Corner, tucked away on a quiet corner, was the heart of the community, a meeting place where the whispers of ailment mingled with the hum of everyday life.  The town, known for its rugged beauty and even more rugged residents, felt isolated tonight, a stark contrast to the bustling city life Amelia had left behind.  The silence of the storm outside amplified the quiet clinking of bottles and the occasional sigh from Amelia as she sorted through the vials of compounded prescriptions.  A single, flickering candle on a nearby counter cast dancing shadows, illuminating the intricate patterns of the etched glass on ancient apothecary jars, a stark reminder of a history the pharmacy held, a history Amelia felt strangely connected to.
