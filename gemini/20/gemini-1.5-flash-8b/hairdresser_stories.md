The chipped porcelain sink of "Scissors & Smiles" gleamed under the harsh fluorescent lights, reflecting Amelia Nightingale's tired eyes.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight piercing the grime-coated windowpanes, illuminating a faded poster of a glamorous 1940s pin-up girl.  The salon, nestled in the heart of the decaying Victorian district of Ashwood, was a testament to forgotten elegance.  Once a bustling hub of stylish coiffures, it now resembled a time capsule, its mirrors fogged with the breath of past clients and the aroma of yesterday's hairspray clinging to the air.  Amelia, her own hair a tangled mess of auburn curls, ran a hand through it, the familiar tang of rosemary and lavender clinging to her fingers.  The clatter of a dropped magazine on the floor echoed the disquiet within her.  Another slow day. Another day where the only laughter she heard was the creaking of the old building itself.
