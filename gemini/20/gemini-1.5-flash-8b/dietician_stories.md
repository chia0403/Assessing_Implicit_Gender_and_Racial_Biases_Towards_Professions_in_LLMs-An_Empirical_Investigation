The biting London wind whipped Amelia Nightingale's scarf around her face, stinging her cheeks.  She pressed her nose against the frosty window of the nutrition clinic, a tiny, almost hidden gem nestled between a bustling bakery and a crumbling Georgian townhouse.  Inside, the scent of cinnamon and simmering herbs mingled with the faint, comforting aroma of freshly brewed chamomile tea.  It was a stark contrast to the grey, relentless drizzle outside, a mirror, Amelia realised, to the often-grey, frustratingly complex diets she counselled her patients.

Amelia Nightingale, registered dietician and owner of "Nourish & Thrive," had carved a niche for herself in the heart of the city's culinary scene.  While other dieticians focused on restrictive diets and quick fixes, Amelia believed in sustainable, personalised plans that took into account individual lifestyles, preferences, and – critically – emotional well-being. Her clinic wasn't just about numbers on a scale; it was about nourishing the whole person.  Today, however, that whole person felt particularly fragile.  A familiar knot of anxiety tightened in her stomach.  A new client, a renowned but visibly troubled opera singer, was due in just an hour.  And the weight of her potential impact, both positive and negative, pressed down on her like the leaden sky itself.
