The chipped porcelain sink, stained a dull, perpetual grey, reflected the flickering gaslight above Amelia Blackwood's head.  Rain hammered against the attic window, a relentless percussion against the fragile silence of the old manor house.  Amelia, a writer of gothic tales, hunched over her worn leather-bound notebook, the faint scent of aged paper and spilled ink clinging to the air.  The house itself, Blackwood Manor, seemed to hold its breath, every creak and groan a whispered secret echoing through the empty halls. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, clawing at the eaves, and Amelia felt a shiver, not just from the chill but from the creeping dread that clung to the very walls of the house.  

Amelia Blackwood was known in the small, isolated village of Oakhaven for her vivid descriptions of the unsettling and the extraordinary, her tales whispered from fireside to fireside. But tonight, the story wasn't coming.  The characters danced on the edges of her mind, elusive and uncooperative. They whispered their tales only in fragments, in the echoing sighs of the wind and the rustle of unseen things in the shadows.  Her quill, usually a faithful servant, felt heavy in her hand.  The only thing clearer than the storm outside was the oppressive feeling of emptiness inside her.
