The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the cobblestone streets of Southwark, London, 1888.  Rain, a relentless curtain of grey, hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Elias Thorne's workshop, a space crammed with the fragrant tang of sawdust and linseed oil. Elias Thorne, a carpenter with hands calloused and strong as seasoned oak, hunched over a workbench piled high with planks of polished mahogany.  The rhythmic thud of his hammer echoed against the damp walls, a counterpoint to the relentless drumming of the storm.  Outside, the city held its breath, bracing itself for the inevitable downpour that would soon engulf the already sodden alleys.  Elias, however, was lost in the intricate grain of a piece of wood, a particularly beautiful piece of cherrywood, shaped almost like a bird in flight.  His mind, usually occupied by the practical demands of his craft, wandered to a more ethereal plane â€“ a realm of curves and angles, of light and shadow.  This particular piece was different.  It pulsed with an almost living energy, defying the limitations of the material.  He felt a peculiar sense of urgency, as if the very wood whispered secrets of a hidden world, secrets that only his hands could decipher.
