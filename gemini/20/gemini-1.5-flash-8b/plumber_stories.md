The flickering neon sign of "Mr. Fix-It Plumbing" cast a sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked cobblestones of Alderwick Lane.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless percussion against the already anxious hum of Reginald Bartholomew Fitzwilliam, a man more accustomed to the rhythmic drip of a leaky faucet than the cacophony of the storm.  Reginald, or "Reg" as he preferred, adjusted his worn leather apron, the damp clinging to his tweed jacket, and peered down the alleyway.  The alley, a labyrinth of overflowing bins and discarded bicycles, was shrouded in an oppressive gloom, punctuated only by the sporadic flashes of lightning.  Tonight, the calls had been particularly relentless, a torrent of clogged drains and busted pipes erupting from the dark corners of Alderwick Lane, a place where even the ghosts seemed to have plumbing problems.  Reg, a man of routine and meticulous preparation, was fighting a losing battle against the tempest.  His trusty wrench, a family heirloom passed down through generations of Fitzwilliam plumbers, felt oddly heavy in his calloused hand.
