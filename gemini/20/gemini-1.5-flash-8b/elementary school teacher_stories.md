The chipped paint of the kindergarten classroom door, a faded robin's egg blue, seemed to sigh in the humid morning air.  Sunlight, fractured by the leaves of the ancient oak outside, spilled across the meticulously arranged blocks, the colourful construction paper collages, and the half-finished drawings of dragons and unicorns.  This was Miss Amelia Hawthorne's kingdom, a temporary sanctuary from the relentless hum of the world outside.

The aroma of freshly brewed coffee, a daily ritual, mingled with the faint, sweet scent of crayons and playdough.  It was a Tuesday morning, the first day of the week in which a new literacy unit was planned, and a sense of anticipation, almost palpable, hung in the air.
