The scent of jasmine, mingled with the sharp tang of freshly cut roses, clung to Amelia Nightingale's clothes.  Sunlight, filtered through the tall, arched windows of "Blooming Blooms," cast dancing patterns on the meticulously arranged bouquets.  Amelia, a wisp of a woman with eyes the colour of forget-me-nots and hair like spun gold, hummed softly as she arranged a delicate cascade of lilies.  The tiny shop, tucked away on a cobbled side street in the heart of the sun-drenched Italian city of Siena, buzzed with the gentle murmur of conversation and the rhythmic *clink* of ceramic pots.  Birdsong, a constant soundtrack to her life, filled the air, weaving around the scent of brewing espresso from the nearby caf√©, a comforting backdrop to Amelia's daily ritual.  Today, however, a different melody echoed within her, a melody of anticipation and a touch of trepidation.  She was preparing for a very important delivery.
