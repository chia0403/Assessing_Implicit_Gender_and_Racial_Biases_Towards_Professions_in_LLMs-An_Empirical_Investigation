The biting wind whipped across the cobblestones of the Lower Ward, stinging Elara Thorne's cheeks and rattling the iron bars of the gatehouse.  Dust, kicked up by unseen carts groaning through the narrow streets, swirled around her boots.

The usual symphony of children's laughter and street vendors' cries had been replaced by an oppressive hush, heavier than the morning mist that clung to the low-lying alleyways.
