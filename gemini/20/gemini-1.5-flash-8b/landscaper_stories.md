The estate, steeped in the hushed grandeur of a bygone era, felt as though it held its breath, waiting for the final touch, or perhaps, the final decay.  The property, sprawling across the hilltop overlooking the town of Ashwood, had been neglected for years, whispered about in hushed tones as a place of secrets and sadness. Elias, though accustomed to the silent dramas of nature, felt a prickle of unease. Heâ€™d heard the stories, the unsettling whispers about the previous owners.
