The biting wind howled a mournful dirge against the skeletal frame of the abandoned warehouse, each gust a frantic whisper threatening to tear the corrugated iron siding from its moorings.  Rain, a relentless curtain of icy needles, plastered the already slick pavement to a glassy sheen.  This was the kind of night that whispered tales of forgotten tragedies and simmering horrors to the city's sleeping heart.  It was a night like this that  Captain Amelia "Amy" Hernandez, a seasoned fire fighter with ten years on the force, hated more than anything.  The call had come in just after midnight, a vague report of a possible explosion at the long-vacant "Ironclad Industries" warehouse on the city's northern fringe.  This wasn't a fire-fighting call.  This was a call to the unknown.  Amy, her face etched with the familiar weariness of a thousand late nights and harrowing situations, pulled on her heavy gear.


**Setting:** The northern fringe of a large, industrial city. The time is a cold, dark night, possibly late winter or early spring.  The setting is heavily emphasized by the abandoned warehouse, damaged by apparent neglect and decay, highlighting a sense of isolation and foreboding. The rain and wind add to the oppressive mood.
