The sterile hum of the operating room was a constant companion to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a symphony of sterile steel and whirring machinery that drowned out the frantic pounding of her own heart.  Blood, crimson and potent, stained the pristine white of the surgical gown, a stark contrast to the meticulous precision she usually demanded of herself.

The air crackled with an unspoken tension, a palpable fear that seeped into the bone marrow.  The patient, a young woman named Amelia, lay still, her chest rising and falling with the labored rhythm of a dying bird.

The city, a sprawling concrete jungle built on the ruins of a forgotten past, pulsed with a life both vibrant and unsettling.  Neon signs flickered like dying embers against the bruised twilight sky, casting long, distorted shadows that danced across the surgical field.  Outside, the relentless drone of traffic, a ceaseless roar of metallic and mechanical life, was a stark counterpoint to the quiet, almost prayerful focus of the surgeons within.
