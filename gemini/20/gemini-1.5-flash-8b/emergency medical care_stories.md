The biting wind whipped Amelia "Amy"  Harrison's lab coat around her legs, stinging her cheeks as she surveyed the desolate, snow-covered landscape.  The sprawling, remote Alaskan town of Knik Glacier, normally a haven of quiet beauty, was choked by a blizzard.  Emergency Medical Care (EMC) 17, a beat-up, four-wheel drive ambulance, rattled over the treacherous ice-packed road, its headlights struggling to pierce the swirling white chaos.  Amy, her breath puffing out in visible clouds, gripped the steering wheel, her knuckles white.  The radio crackled with static punctuated by the frantic, strained voice of a dispatcher.  "We're getting reports of a possible avalanche... near the abandoned gold mine...  multiple casualties...  Code Red... EMC 17, respond immediately."
