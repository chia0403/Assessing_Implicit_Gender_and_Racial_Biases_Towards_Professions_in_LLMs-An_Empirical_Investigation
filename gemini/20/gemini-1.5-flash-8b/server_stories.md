The flickering fluorescent lights of "The Rusty Mug" cast long, distorted shadows across Amelia Blackwood's tired face.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grime-coated window, illuminating a miniature tornado of swirling coffee grounds at the bottom of a chipped porcelain mug.  The scent of burnt sugar and stale beer hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma that had become, in its own way, a familiar companion.  Outside, the rhythmic clang of a nearby shipyard echoed through the small, seaside town of Port Haven, a sound that had become Amelia's lullaby and her soundtrack to the ceaseless rhythm of her days.  She was a server at The Rusty Mug, a perpetually bustling, if slightly chaotic, haven for sailors, dockworkers, and the occasional weary traveler seeking a cheap meal and a warm, if slightly greasy, plate.  The year was 1928.
