The fluorescent lights of Mrs. Eleanor Vance's third-grade classroom hummed a monotonous B-flat, a counterpoint to the chaotic symphony of twenty-eight nine-year-olds preparing for their annual Pioneer Day celebration.

Eleanor, her auburn hair escaping its bun, surveyed the scene with a mixture of fondness and exhaustion. This year's celebration, with its requisite miniature covered wagons and butter churning demonstrations, was threatening to churn her stomach more than the butter itself.
