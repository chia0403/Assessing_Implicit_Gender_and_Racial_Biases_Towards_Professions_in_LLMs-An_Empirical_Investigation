Flight 472 from JFK to Heathrow was delayed, again.  Outside, the late afternoon sun beat down on the tarmac of the bustling New York airport, turning the waiting planes into gleaming metal behemoths. Inside, the pre-boarding announcements crackled through the gate area, adding another layer of noise to the already cacophonous symphony of crying babies, ringing phones, and the low rumble of conversations in a dozen different languages. Amy, perched precariously on the edge of her jump seat, idly flipped through the worn pages of a paperback novel, her mind miles away from the impending transatlantic flight. This was her third delay in two days, and the glamorous life of a flight attendant was starting to feel less like an adventure and more like an exercise in enduring endless airport purgatory.  The little paper cup of lukewarm coffee in her hand suddenly felt very heavy indeed.
