The relentless Miami sun beat down on Ocean Drive, turning the turquoise water into shimmering diamonds.  Salt air mingled with the scent of coconut oil and exhaust fumes, a heady perfume that Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez inhaled deeply before stepping onto the raised platform overlooking South Pointe Park.  Her wireless microphone, clipped to the vibrant pink tank top straining against her biceps, crackled to life.  Amy’s blonde ponytail, secured with a neon green scrunchie, bounced as she grinned at the assembled crowd.  Tourists in ill-fitting swimwear and locals sculpted from years of sun and sweat waited expectantly, yoga mats unfurled, water bottles at the ready.  It was 7:00 am, and Amy’s "Sunrise Sweat" class was about to begin. This was her stage, the beach her theatre, and the rising sun her spotlight.  Today, however, the performance was about to take an unexpected turn.
