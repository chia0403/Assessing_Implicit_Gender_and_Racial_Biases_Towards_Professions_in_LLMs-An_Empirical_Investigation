The bell above the door of "Petal & Stem" chimed, a delicate counterpoint to the rhythmic snip of Elara Thistlewick's shears.  Outside, the cobblestone streets of Port Blossom shimmered under a late-afternoon sun, the air thick with the scent of salt and the approaching tide. Elara, her brow furrowed in concentration, was coaxing a reluctant sprig of lavender into submission, weaving it into a cascading bouquet of ivory roses and deep purple lisianthus. Her shop, nestled between a bakery overflowing with the aroma of cinnamon rolls and a dusty antique bookstore, was a riot of color and fragrance.  Sunbeams streamed through the large front window, illuminating hanging baskets overflowing with petunias and illuminating shelves crammed with vintage watering cans and mismatched porcelain vases.  This tiny slice of floral paradise, carved out in a seaside town perpetually on the verge of being reclaimed by the sea, was Elaraâ€™s sanctuary, her legacy, and, lately, her biggest worry.
