The biting Alaskan wind whipped at Amelia "Ace" Petrova's flight suit as she prepped her Cessna 207 Skywagon for takeoff.  The tiny airstrip, carved precariously into the side of a snow-dusted mountain near the remote village of  Shishmaref, offered a breathtaking, if unnerving, view of the churning Bering Sea.  Grey clouds, heavy with the promise of snow, scudded low across the sky, swallowing the distant peaks of the Seward Peninsula. It was late November, and the sun, a weak, watery disc, clung stubbornly to the horizon, casting long, skeletal shadows across the frozen tundra.  Ace tightened the fur-lined hood of her parka, the icy air stinging her exposed cheeks. This was her last run of the day, a mercy flight carrying vital medical supplies to a remote fishing outpost further up the coast. A familiar knot of anxiety tightened in her stomach.  Winter in the Alaskan bush was a cruel mistress, and even for a seasoned pilot like Ace, every flight was a gamble.
