The tar hissed and bubbled under the propane torch, sending up a shimmer of heat that distorted the already hazy Charleston skyline.  Elijah Beaumont, sweat plastering his red bandanna to his forehead, adjusted his grip on the torch and nudged the melting roll of tar along the seam.  Below him, the pitched roof of the historic St. Michael's Episcopal Church sloped down at a dizzying angle, the cobblestone streets a dizzying patchwork of grey and beige far below.  A salty breeze, thick with the scent of pluff mud and honeysuckle, tugged at the edges of his worn denim shirt.  It was late May, the kind of humid, shimmering Charleston afternoon that could melt the fillings right out of your teeth, but Elijah found a certain satisfaction in the heat, in the honest labor, in the way the old roof groaned and settled beneath his weight like a slumbering giant. This was his city, his rhythm, and he knew its every peak and valley, every gable and chimney, as intimately as the lines on his own calloused hands.
