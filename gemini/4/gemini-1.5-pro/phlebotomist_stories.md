The fluorescent lights of St. Jude's Hospital hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Reyes's life.  The pre-dawn chill hadn't quite left the air, clinging to the sterile surfaces of the Phlebotomy Lab.  Outside, the Chicago skyline was just beginning to blush pink and orange, a vibrant contrast to the pale green walls within.  Amelia, her dark hair pulled back in a tight bun, methodically arranged her tray: tourniquets, vacutainers, butterfly needles, alcohol swabs â€“ the tools of her trade. At precisely 5:55 a.m., a soft chime announced the arrival of the hospital's first patient transport, and Amelia, with a small, practiced smile, pushed her cart into the hallway, ready to greet the day and its veins.
