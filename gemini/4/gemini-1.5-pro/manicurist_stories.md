The bell above the door of "Nailed It," a tiny salon squeezed between a laundromat and a questionable empanada shop, jingled merrily, announcing the arrival of another Tuesday morning.  Rain lashed against the large front window, obscuring the view of the perpetually grey Manchester sky. Inside, amidst the scent of acetone and lavender hand cream, Elara Rose Hawthorne sighed, meticulously arranging miniature bottles of glitter polish.  Her salon, a testament to her hard work and unwavering optimism, was her sanctuary, a splash of vibrant colour in a world that often felt washed out.  This Tuesday, however, felt particularly bleak.  The rain had kept customers away, and Elara's usually infectious enthusiasm was struggling to break through the damp, melancholic atmosphere.  She glanced at the clock, its plastic hands mockingly slow, and wondered if anyone would brave the weather for a perfect French manicure.
