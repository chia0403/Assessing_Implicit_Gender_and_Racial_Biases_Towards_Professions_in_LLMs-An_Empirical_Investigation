The insistent chime of the grandfathered-in rotary phone sliced through the quiet hum of the Aquamarine Aquarium.  Coralia Reyes, seated behind a polished mahogany desk shaped like a giant clam shell, sighed and pushed a stray curl of her vibrant teal hair behind her ear.  Sunlight, fractured by the enormous cylindrical tank behind her, splashed kaleidoscopic patterns across the worn linoleum floor.  Schools of electric blue tangs darted through the artificial coral, oblivious to Coralia's growing irritation.  It was barely 9 am on a Tuesday, and already the phone seemed determined to ring off its hook â€“ mostly calls about lost children, misplaced car keys, and the price of admission for a family of twelve. The Aquamarine, a faded gem on the edge of the sleepy seaside town of Port Blossom, wasn't exactly SeaWorld, but it held a certain nostalgic charm for the locals, particularly during the sweltering summer months. The air hung thick and salty, promising another scorching day, and Coralia braced herself for the inevitable influx of sweaty, sunscreen-slathered tourists.
