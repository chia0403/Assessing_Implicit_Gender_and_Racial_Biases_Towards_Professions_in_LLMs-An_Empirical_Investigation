Rain lashed against the attic window of Elias Thorne's office, a frantic rhythm echoing the frantic tapping of his fingers on the ancient oak desk. Loose papers, covered in Elias's spidery scrawl, danced across the surface, threatened by the draft snaking through the ill-fitting pane.  The only illumination in the cramped space came from a gooseneck lamp, casting a harsh, yellow circle over a manuscript titled "The Whispers of Aethelred."  Elias Thorne, editor extraordinaire for the obscure publishing house of Phantasmagoria Press, shivered, not entirely from the cold. The manuscript, a supposed historical account of a forgotten king, had arrived three days ago, unsolicited and smelling faintly of graveyard earth.  It was the prose, though, that chilled him. Eloquent, hypnotic, and utterly unsettling.  Outside, the wind howled, a sound strangely similar to a whispered voice.  The attic room, nestled high above the cobbled streets of Victorian London, felt suddenly smaller, more claustrophobic.
