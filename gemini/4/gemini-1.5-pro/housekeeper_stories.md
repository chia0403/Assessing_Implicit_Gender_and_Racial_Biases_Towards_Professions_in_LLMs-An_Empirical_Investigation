The biting November wind whipped around the eaves of Ashworth Manor, rattling the ancient windowpanes like restless spirits.  Inside, the grand hall, with its vaulted ceiling and faded tapestries depicting scenes of boar hunts and courtly love, was shrouded in a perpetual twilight.

A strange tension hung in the air, a premonition of something about to shift, to shatter the fragile equilibrium of Ashworth Manor.
