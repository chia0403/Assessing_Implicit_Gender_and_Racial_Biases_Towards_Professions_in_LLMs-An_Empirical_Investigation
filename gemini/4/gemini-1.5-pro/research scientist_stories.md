The biting Antarctic wind whipped at Dr. Aris Thorne’s parka, stinging his exposed cheeks despite the thick balaclava.  Ice crystals, fine as diamond dust, danced in the perpetual twilight that clung to the McMurdo Dry Valleys. This desolate expanse, one of the few ice-free regions on the continent, was a paradox: a frozen desert, a land of extremes. Here, nestled between the jagged peaks of the Transantarctic Mountains and the frozen Ross Sea, Aris had established his temporary research base.  Prefabricated modules, bolted to the permafrost and connected by a network of insulated walkways, huddled together like penguins against the relentless wind. Within, a humming generator provided a fragile bubble of warmth and light against the encroaching cold. Aris, his breath clouding the frosty air, surveyed the otherworldly landscape, a flicker of unease beneath his usual scientific detachment. He hadn’t expected this mission, funded by a shadowy consortium he still didn’t fully understand, to feel quite so…isolated.
