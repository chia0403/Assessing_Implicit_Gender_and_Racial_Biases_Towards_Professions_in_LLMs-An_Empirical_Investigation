The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorne, tugging at the brim of his worn tweed cap and stinging his cheeks.  Frost crunched under his heavy boots as he traversed the winding gravel path of Eventide Manor, the grand, albeit slightly crumbling, Victorian edifice looming over him like a benevolent, grey-stoned giant.  Dead leaves, the colour of rust and old pennies, swirled around his ankles, clinging to the damp hems of his trousers. Elias, head groundskeeper for the past fifteen years, knew every inch of the sprawling ten-acre estate, from the formal rose garden, currently slumbering beneath a thick layer of straw, to the wild, untamed woodland that bordered the property to the west.  This morning, however, his attention was focused on the ancient oak that stood sentinel at the manor's main entrance.  Its skeletal branches, usually teeming with boisterous crows, were bare and stark against the bruised purple sky, and a deep, unsettling groan emanated from its core with every gust of wind. Something wasn't right.
