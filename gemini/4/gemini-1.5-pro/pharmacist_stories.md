The bell above the door of Murray's Apothecary jingled merrily, a counterpoint to the relentless drumming of rain against the large, arched windows.  Eleanor Vance, Pharm.D., adjusted her spectacles, pushing a stray auburn curl back behind her ear as she glanced up from the mortar and pestle she was meticulously using to grind dried chamomile flowers.  The apothecary, nestled on a cobbled side street just off the bustling market square of Port Blossom, Maine, was filled with the comforting aroma of herbs, tinctures, and beeswax candles.  Outside, the grey November sky pressed down on the small, seaside town, but inside, a warm, golden light radiated from the gas lamps hanging from the low, beamed ceiling, casting flickering shadows on the shelves lined with antique medicine bottles and jars filled with mysterious ingredients.  This was Eleanor's sanctuary, a place where the ancient art of healing met the precision of modern pharmacology, and where the secrets whispered by the sea mingled with the rustling of prescription papers.
