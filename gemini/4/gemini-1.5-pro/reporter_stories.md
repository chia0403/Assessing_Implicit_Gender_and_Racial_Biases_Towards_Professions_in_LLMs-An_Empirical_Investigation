The biting wind whipped Amelia "Milly" Reyes's auburn braid across her face as she stared up at the skeletal remains of the Ferris wheel.  Rust gnawed at its metal bones, the faded carriages swaying gently in the gale like forgotten ghosts.  Around her, the remnants of Joyland, once the crown jewel of the Jersey Shore boardwalk, lay in crumbling decay.  Salt spray kissed the peeling paint of the haunted house, the carousel horses stood frozen mid-gallop, their chipped smiles mocking the silence.  The only sound besides the wind and the distant crash of waves was the persistent click of Milly's worn heels on the cracked asphalt.  This wasn't the Jersey Shore of postcard sunsets and boisterous laughter. This was a graveyard of forgotten summers, and Milly, a reporter for the struggling Asbury Park Gazette, was here to exhume its secrets.
