The salt-laced wind whipped Aurelia "Aura" Beaumont's fiery red hair across her face, momentarily blinding her as she surveyed the scene before her.  Perched precariously on a crumbling stone wall overlooking the churning grey sea, her fingers, stained with cerulean and crimson, tightened around her worn leather-bound sketchbook. The Isle of Aisling, a jagged splinter of land off the coast of Ireland, was a tempestuous beauty this November morning.  The only sounds were the relentless crash of waves against the black cliffs and the mournful cry of gulls circling overhead.  The sky, a bruised purple, promised rain, but Aura barely noticed.  Her entire being was consumed by the sight of the abandoned lighthouse clinging to the cliff edge, its white paint peeling like sunburnt skin, a solitary sentinel against the encroaching storm. It was this decaying grandeur, this defiant fragility, that had drawn her to Aisling, to this isolated spot where she hoped to finally capture the elusive essence of loneliness on canvas.
