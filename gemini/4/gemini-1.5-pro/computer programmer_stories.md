Lines of code scrolled across the screen, reflecting in her tired, hazel eyes. Tonight, Eleanor wasn't chasing bugs or optimizing algorithms. Tonight, she was chasing a ghost in the machine, a digital phantom that threatened to unravel the fabric of Neo-Kyoto's meticulously crafted virtual reality.
