The brass doors of the Grand Majestic Hotel groaned open, releasing a wave of chilled, perfumed air onto the bustling city street. Rain slicked the pavement, reflecting the neon glow of the pawn shop across the avenue. Inside, beneath a chandelier that could have housed a small family,  Fitzwilliam "Fitz" Higgins, a bellhop of precisely seventeen years and four months, straightened his pillbox hat and stifled a yawn. The lobby, a cavern of marble and mahogany, hummed with the low murmur of conversations and the click of high heels on the polished floor.  Fitz, in his crisp navy uniform and strategically placed freckles, looked younger than he was, a fact he both resented and relied upon to charm particularly generous guests. Tonight, however, the charm felt heavy, like the lead weights sewn into the hems of his trousers to prevent them from billowing. It was the third night of the infamous "Harvester Moon Gala," an annual event that drew the city's wealthiest and most eccentric to the Grand Majestic, and Fitzâ€™s feet throbbed with the promise of another long, sleepless shift.
