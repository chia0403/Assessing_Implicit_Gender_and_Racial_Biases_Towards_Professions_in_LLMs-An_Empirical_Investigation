The flickering fluorescent lights of the St. Jude's Hospital basement buzzed like trapped insects, casting long, skeletal shadows across the damp concrete floor.  The air hung thick with the mingled scents of disinfectant and something vaguely metallic, a smell Elias Finch had long since ceased to notice.  Elias, whose full name was Elias Jeremiah Finch, pushed his mop bucket across the slick floor, the squeaky wheels a counterpoint to the rhythmic swish-swish of the mop head.  It was 3:17 am, the quietest hour in the hospital, a time when even the ghosts seemed to sleep.  Tonight, however, a different kind of stillness hung in the air, a stillness that prickled the hairs on the back of Elias's neck and made him grip the mop handle a little tighter.  Outside, a storm raged, lashing rain against the small, barred windows high in the wall, but down here, in the labyrinthine depths of the hospital, something else felt wrong.  Very wrong.
