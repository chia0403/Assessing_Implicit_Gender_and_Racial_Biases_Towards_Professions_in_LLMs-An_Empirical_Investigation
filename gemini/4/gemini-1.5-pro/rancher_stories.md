The wind, sharp and smelling of impending snow, whipped across the plains of Montana, tugging at the brim of Elias Vance Holloway's Stetson.  He squinted against the grey, late November sky, the lines around his hazel eyes deepening like the furrows in the fields he surveyed. His ranch, the Whispering Pines, stretched out before him, a patchwork of russet and gold against the encroaching winter.  The sprawling two-story farmhouse, built by his grandfather, stood solid against the gusts, smoke curling lazily from its chimney, a beacon in the vastness.  This was his legacy, these acres carved from unforgiving land, a testament to generations of Holloways who had weathered harsher winters than this.  But this winter, Elias knew, felt different.  There was a stillness in the air, a pregnant silence beyond the wind's howl, that whispered of something more than just snow.
