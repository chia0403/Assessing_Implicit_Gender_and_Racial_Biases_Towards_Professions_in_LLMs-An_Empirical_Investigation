The siren wailed, a banshee's scream cutting through the thick, humid Florida air.  Rain lashed against the windshield of Rescue 27, blurring the already fading neon glow of the strip malls lining US 19.  Inside, Paramedic Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez gripped the dashboard, her knuckles white against her tanned skin.  The dispatch call had been terse: possible cardiac arrest, elderly female, location: the Whispering Pines Mobile Home Park, lot 47.  Amy knew Whispering Pines.  Tucked away behind a derelict putt-putt course, it was a labyrinth of crumbling asphalt and overgrown bougainvillea, a place where ambulances often got lost and calls rarely ended well. Tonight, with the storm raging and the power flickering, it felt even more ominous than usual.  She tightened her grip on the dashboard, her stomach knotting with a familiar pre-arrival anxiety.  Beside her, her partner, a rookie barely out of EMT school named Kevin, nervously checked his equipment bag. The air in the ambulance crackled with tension, thick and heavy like the impending downpour.
