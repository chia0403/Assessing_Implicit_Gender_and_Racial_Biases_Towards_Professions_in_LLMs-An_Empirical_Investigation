The opulent lobby of the Hotel Magnifique shimmered, every surface polished to a blinding sheen. Crystal chandeliers cast rainbows across the tessellated marble floor, and the air hummed with the low murmur of hushed conversations and the clinking of champagne flutes.

From her mahogany-and-brass concierge desk, strategically placed to command a view of both the revolving doors and the grand staircase, Genevieve orchestrated the desires of the hotel’s elite clientele. Tonight, however, a dissonant note jarred the usual symphony of luxury. A single, wilting sunflower lay on her otherwise immaculate desk, its head bowed as if in shame.  It was addressed simply: “For Genevieve.”  The scent of its dying pollen mingled with the heady perfume of orchids and lilies, creating a strangely unsettling aroma that mirrored the knot of unease tightening in Genevieve’s stomach.
