The clatter of pots and pans, a symphony only Elara Thistlewick appreciated, filled the cramped galley kitchen.  Salt spray stung the air drifting in through the porthole, a constant reminder of their precarious position aboard the *Whistling Kettle*, a tramp freighter currently battling a squall somewhere between the volcanic isles of the Sundered Archipelago and the fog-shrouded coast of the Whispering Continent.

The aroma, a bizarre yet strangely comforting blend of cinnamon, brine, and something vaguely volcanic, permeated the ship, battling the ever-present scent of engine grease and desperation.  This wasn't exactly the five-star establishment she'd dreamed of running, but it was hers, in a manner of speaking.
