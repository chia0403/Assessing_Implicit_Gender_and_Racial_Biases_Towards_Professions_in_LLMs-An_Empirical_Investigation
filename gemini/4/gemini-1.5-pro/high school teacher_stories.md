The late afternoon sun, a molten orange orb sinking behind the serrated peaks of the Cascades, cast long shadows across the empty parking lot of Northwood High.  Agnes Amelia Thatcher, her sensible brown cardigan pulled tight against the encroaching chill, locked her classroom door, the metallic click echoing in the deserted hallway.  Pine needles, swept in by the gusting autumn wind, skittered across the linoleum floor, a rustling counterpoint to the distant roar of logging trucks rumbling down Highway 16.  Northwood, Oregon, a small lumber town nestled deep in the heart of the Willamette National Forest, was a place of stark contrasts: the rugged beauty of the surrounding wilderness juxtaposed with the hardscrabble reality of a community clinging to a dying industry. Agnes, in her ten years of teaching English literature at Northwood High, had grown accustomed to this dichotomy, finding a strange solace in its quiet, almost melancholic rhythm.  But tonight, a different kind of silence hung in the air, a stillness that prickled her skin and whispered of something unsettling on the wind.
