The insistent chirping of a robin outside her window did little to lighten the November gloom that clung to Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne like a damp wool coat.  Amy, nestled in her mismatched armchair in her tiny flat above "A World Away Travel," watched the icy rain lash against the windowpane. The aroma of burnt toast wafted from the kitchenette, a testament to her distracted state.  Her travel agency, squeezed between a laundromat and a perpetually closed antique shop on Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village, NYC, was usually a vibrant hub of colourful brochures, pinned maps bristling with flags, and the constant thrum of Amy's infectious enthusiasm for adventure.  But today, the only sound was the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner, each tick a mocking reminder of the looming deadline and the empty inbox on her computer screen.  This year, the annual "Around the World in 80 Days" package, Amy's signature creation, had attracted zero interest.  Zero.  And if she didn't sell at least five packages by the end of the week, A World Away Travel, her dream, her life's work, would become just another boarded-up storefront on Bleecker Street.
