The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the Rusty Mug, a rhythm Amelia "Mia" Rodriguez knew as well as her own heartbeat.  Inside, the air was thick with the mingled scents of stale beer, cheap whiskey, and desperation, punctuated by the occasional sharp tang of bleach.  Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the worn-out linoleum floor and the handful of regulars huddled at the bar.  The Rusty Mug perched precariously on the edge of Highway 17, just outside the desolate town of Dustbowl, Nevada, a place forgotten by time and bypassed by fortune. Mia, with her dark, tired eyes and a nametag clinging precariously to her faded denim shirt, polished a glass with a practiced hand, the silence broken only by the relentless drumming of the rain and the low hum of the ancient refrigerator struggling to keep the beer cold.  Tonight, like most nights, promised to be slow, but Mia knew better than to expect quiet in a place like Dustbowl.  Trouble always found its way in, eventually.
