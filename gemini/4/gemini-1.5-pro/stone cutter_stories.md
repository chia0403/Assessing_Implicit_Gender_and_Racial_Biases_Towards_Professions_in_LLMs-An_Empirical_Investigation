The wind, sharp and cold off the Scythian steppe, whipped at Elias Thorne’s chapped hands as he surveyed the half-finished angel perched precariously on the scaffolding. Grey clouds scudded across the iron sky, threatening snow that would further complicate his already precarious deadline. Below him, the bustling marketplace of Aethelburg sprawled like a tapestry woven with mud and thatch, the shouts of vendors and the bleating of sheep barely audible above the wind’s howl.  Elias, perched high on the wooden platform against the flank of St. Osyth's Abbey, felt a tremor of vertigo that had little to do with the height and everything to do with the sheer weight of expectation pressing down on him. This angel, commissioned by the Abbey’s prickly Abbot Theodore, was Elias's masterpiece, his chance to finally secure his reputation as the finest stone cutter in Northumbria. But with the winter solstice fast approaching and the angel still lacking a face, Elias feared he'd carved his own artistic tombstone instead of a heavenly messenger.
