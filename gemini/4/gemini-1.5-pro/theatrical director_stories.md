The biting November wind whipped around Evelyn Beatrice Thorne as she navigated the labyrinthine alleyways behind the Grand Majestic Theatre in Chicago.  Decaying brick walls, plastered with peeling posters advertising long-past productions of "Cats" and "Phantom," loomed over her. The air, thick with the smell of stale beer and forgotten dreams, clung to her wool coat.  Evelyn, clutching a thermos of lukewarm Earl Grey and a tattered copy of "Hedda Gabler," shivered, not entirely from the cold.  Tonight was the premiere of her reimagined, avant-garde production of Ibsen’s masterpiece, and the weight of months of relentless work, battling skeptical producers and temperamental actors, pressed down on her like the oppressive Chicago skyline. The Grand Majestic, once a jewel of the city's theatre scene, now showed its age, a faded grandeur echoing the uncertainty that gnawed at Evelyn’s gut.  This production was her chance, her last chance perhaps, to prove she wasn't just the daughter of a famous director, but a visionary in her own right.  The stage door, a chipped and peeling slab of green, beckoned her into the dimly lit bowels of the theatre.
