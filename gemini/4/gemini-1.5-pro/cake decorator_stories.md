The whir of the stand mixer was Amelia "Millie" Reyes's morning meditation. The scent of vanilla, potent and sweet, curled around her like a comforting hug as she meticulously creamed butter and sugar in the gleaming stainless steel bowl. Her bakery, "Flourish & Frost," nestled in the heart of Willow Creek, Oregon, was a riot of pastel colors and the aroma of baked goods.  Willow Creek, a town so small you could blink and miss it driving down the coastal highway, was a place where everyone knew everyone, and Millie, with her warm smile and even warmer cakes, was a local treasure.  Sunlight, filtered through the lace curtains in the bakery window, painted dappled patterns on the worn wooden floorboards.  The bell above the door chimed, announcing the arrival of the first customer of the day, and Millie, hands dusted with flour, looked up with a smile, expecting the usual order of Mrs. Henderson's cinnamon rolls. What she saw instead stopped her mid-greet, a look of stunned confusion replacing the welcoming smile.  Standing in the doorway, silhouetted against the morning sun, was a man she hadn't seen in ten years.
