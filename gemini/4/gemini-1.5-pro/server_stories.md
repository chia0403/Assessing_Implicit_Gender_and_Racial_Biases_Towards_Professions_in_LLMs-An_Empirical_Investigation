The flickering neon sign of the Starlight Diner cast a greasy, rainbow sheen across the rain-slicked asphalt of Bleecker Street. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of frying onions, stale coffee, and desperation.  Eleanor Vance, a woman whose name suggested a quiet dignity at odds with her current occupation, wiped a sticky residue off a Formica tabletop with a practiced flick of her wrist.  It was 2:17 am, the graveyard shift was dragging its heels towards dawn, and the Starlight, usually bustling with a mix of insomniacs and late-night revelers, was eerily empty. The only other person present was Manny, the short-order cook, who hummed a mournful tango as he flipped burgers that would likely go uneaten.  A bell above the door chimed, its cheerful jingle sounding jarring in the silence, and Eleanor plastered a weary smile on her face, bracing herself for another lonely soul seeking refuge in the harsh glow of the Starlight.
