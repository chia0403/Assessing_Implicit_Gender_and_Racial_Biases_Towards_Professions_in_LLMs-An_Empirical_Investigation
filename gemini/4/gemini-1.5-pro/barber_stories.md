The rusty bell above the door of "Finnian O'Malley's Tonsorial Parlour" jingled merrily, a counterpoint to the mournful wail of a distant foghorn.  Salt-laced air, thick with the scent of brine and seaweed, drifted in from the choppy grey waters of the North Atlantic, clinging to the worn velvet curtains and the faded striped pole outside.  The small shop, nestled between a fishmonger and a perpetually shuttered fortune teller's booth on the cobbled streets of Port Blossom, Maine, was dimly lit by a single gas lamp that hissed softly overhead.  Finnian O'Malley, his spectacles perched precariously on his nose, meticulously honed his straight razor against a worn leather strop, the rhythmic scraping a familiar soundtrack to the quiet, rainy Tuesday morning.  The only other sound was the gentle ticking of a grandfather clock in the corner, a stoic observer of the comings and goings of Port Blossom’s residents – and the secrets they often whispered into Finnian’s ear.
