The sun, a malevolent eye in the bleached sky, beat down on the shimmering asphalt of Interstate 80.  Heat rose in visible waves, distorting the distant Nevada mountains into wavering, mirage-like shapes.  Dust devils, born from the dry earth and restless wind, danced across the barren median, occasionally swirling up to lick at the orange cones marking off the work zone.  Calliope "Callie" Jones wiped sweat from her brow with the back of her gloved hand, the grime smearing across her cheek like war paint.  The air vibrated with the low growl of heavy machinery, the clang of metal on metal, and the occasional shouted instruction.  Callie, her safety vest blazing a defiant orange against the muted landscape, adjusted her hard hat and squinted at the cracked section of highway she was tasked with repairing.  Mile marker 147, another blister on the long, sun-baked skin of I-80, another small battle in the endless war against entropy.
