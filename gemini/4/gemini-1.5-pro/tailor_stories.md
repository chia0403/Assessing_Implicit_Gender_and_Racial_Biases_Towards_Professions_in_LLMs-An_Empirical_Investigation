The clatter of horse-drawn carriages on cobblestones was a constant lullaby in the Rue des Filatiers, a narrow street in the heart of 1888 Paris, perpetually smelling of pipe tobacco, roasting chestnuts, and, in Elias Thorne's case, beeswax and wool. Elias, full name Elias Auguste Thorne, meticulously pressed a crease into a pair of charcoal trousers, the gaslight above his workbench casting elongated shadows across the cramped confines of his atelier.  His shop, “Thorne & Fils,” a legacy from his father though he now worked alone, was sandwiched between a bustling boulangerie and a rather dubious establishment with velvet curtains perpetually drawn.  Dust motes danced in the golden light, illuminating the spools of thread, the gleaming needles, and the half-finished garments draped over dress forms like silent spectres. Outside, the first hints of autumn clung to the air, promising crisp mornings and the rich, earthy hues Elias so loved to incorporate into his creations.  This evening, however, held a different kind of promise, a disquieting hum that resonated deeper than the city's usual rumble.
