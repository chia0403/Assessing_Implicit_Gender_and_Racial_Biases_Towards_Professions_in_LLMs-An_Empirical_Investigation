The incessant drumming of rain against the corrugated iron roof mirrored the throbbing ache in Dr. Elias Thorne's temples.  His chiropractic clinic, nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed antique store in the drowsy town of Havenwood, Oregon, usually exuded a calming aroma of lavender and sandalwood.  Today, however, the scent was overpowered by the damp, earthy smell of the storm raging outside.  Havenwood, typically bathed in the soft glow of the Pacific Northwest sun, was shrouded in a thick, grey fog, the kind that clung to the towering Douglas firs and seeped into the very bones of the town. Elias glanced at the vintage clock on the wall â€“ 5:57 pm. Three minutes until closing, and not a single patient had walked through the door all day. He rubbed his hands together, the chill settling deep despite the crackling fire in the corner hearth. This wasn't how he'd envisioned his Tuesday.
