Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the Golden Barrel Diner, blurring the neon "Open" sign into a shimmering halo. Inside, the air hung thick with the aroma of stale coffee and frying onions.  Eleanor Vance, her navy suit jacket damp and clinging to her shoulders, stirred her lukewarm coffee, the cheap plastic spoon clicking rhythmically against the thick ceramic mug.  Outside, the desolate highway stretched across the Nevada desert, vanishing into the rain-streaked darkness. Eleanor had been driving for eight hours, chasing a lead on a potential client, a rancher named Jebediah Grimes who supposedly needed a whole new irrigation system. Her stomach grumbled, a hollow counterpoint to the mournful whine of the wind.  This was not how she envisioned her Tuesday, and Grimes, if he even existed, was proving elusive.  Eleanor was good at her job, a top performer at Agri-Corp, but even the best salesperson can't sell to a ghost.  She pulled out her battered phone, the screen cracked from a previous, equally frustrating road trip, and checked the address again. "Grimes Ranch, Highway 49, twenty miles past Dust Devil Junction..."  She sighed. Dust Devil Junction. It sounded like a place where dreams, and salespeople, went to die.
