The biting November wind whipped across the cracked asphalt of O'Malley's Auto Repair, tugging at the frayed edges of the "We Fix Anything (Almost)" banner strung across the corrugated iron facade.  Inside, grease-stained fluorescent lights hummed over the cluttered workspace, casting long, distorted shadows.  Eleanor Vance, her auburn hair tucked haphazardly under a faded Red Sox cap, lay sprawled beneath a cherry-red 1967 Mustang, a wrench clutched in her hand.  The air hung thick with the scent of motor oil, exhaust fumes, and the faint sweetness of the cinnamon gum Eleanor perpetually chewed.  The radio, perched precariously on a stack of old tires, crackled out a bluesy tune, the melancholy notes a stark contrast to the vibrant energy Eleanor exuded even while covered head to toe in grime.  Tucked away on the outskirts of Harmony Creek, a small town nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, O'Malley's was Eleanor's sanctuary, a place where the roar of engines drowned out the whispers of a past she tried desperately to keep buried.
