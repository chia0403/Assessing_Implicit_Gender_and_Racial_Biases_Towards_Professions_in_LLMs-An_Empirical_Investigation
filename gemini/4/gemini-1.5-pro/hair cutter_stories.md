The rusty bell above the door of "Shear Delights" jingled merrily, a counterpoint to the rumble of thunder echoing through the narrow streets of Port Blossom, Oregon. Rain lashed against the large window, blurring the view of the deserted harbor. Inside, Elias Thorne, his name stitched in elegant cursive on the breast pocket of his denim apron, swept a pile of auburn curls into a dustpan.  The only other occupants of the small salon were a wilting fern in the corner and the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock, a relic from Eliasâ€™s grandmother.  The air hung thick with the scent of coconut shampoo and the faint, metallic tang of impending storm.  It was a Tuesday afternoon, typically the slowest day of the week, but today, even by Tuesday standards, Port Blossom felt unusually deserted. Elias had a nagging feeling, a prickle at the back of his neck, that the quiet held more than just the promise of rain.
