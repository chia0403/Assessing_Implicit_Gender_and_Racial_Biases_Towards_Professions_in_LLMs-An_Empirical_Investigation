Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Amelia Hayes' forty-second-floor office, the cityscape of Chicago dissolving into a blurry watercolour of greys and blues.  Amelia, CEO of Hayes & Sterling Investments, tapped a manicured nail against the polished mahogany of her desk, the rhythmic click a counterpoint to the storm raging outside.  The sleek, minimalist space, usually a sanctuary of order and control, felt oppressive tonight. The air hung heavy with the scent of brewing coffee, a testament to the ungodly hour and the mountain of paperwork still awaiting her attention.  Below, the rhythmic pulse of traffic on Michigan Avenue was muted by the downpour, a distant hum that did little to break the suffocating silence.  A single lamp illuminated the documents spread across her desk, each page detailing the precarious state of the company’s latest acquisition – a failing tech startup that was quickly becoming a black hole, threatening to drag Hayes & Sterling down with it.
