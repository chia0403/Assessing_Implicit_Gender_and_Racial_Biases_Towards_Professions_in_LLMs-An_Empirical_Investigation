Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Cassandra “Cassie” Moreau’s office, blurring the already fading London skyline into a watercolor of greys and blacks.  Twenty-two stories below, the traffic on the Embankment crawled, its headlights smearing across the slick tarmac like errant brushstrokes. Inside, the only sound louder than the drumming rain was the insistent tapping of Cassie’s pen against her drafting table. Scattered blueprints, each meticulously annotated with precise measurements and elegant, flowing lines, formed a paper archipelago across the polished oak surface.  The air hummed with the low thrum of the building’s ventilation system and the faint scent of Cassie's Earl Grey tea, long gone cold.  It was a Thursday night, pushing past 10 pm, and St. Paul's Cathedral, usually a majestic presence visible from her office, was swallowed by the storm. This was a familiar scene for Cassie. Dedication, bordering on obsession, fueled her passion for architecture, and tonight, it was focused on a particularly challenging commission: the restoration of a crumbling, forgotten opera house nestled in the heart of Venice.
