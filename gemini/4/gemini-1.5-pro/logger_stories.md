The biting pre-dawn air, crisp and smelling of pine needles and damp earth, nipped at Elijah "Eli" Blackwood's exposed cheeks. Frost crunched under his heavy boots as he trudged through the clearing towards the groaning behemoth that was his livelihood: a 1957 Kenworth logging truck, affectionately nicknamed "The Widowmaker."  The towering Cascade Mountains of Washington State loomed around him, cloaked in the ethereal mist of a rapidly fading autumn.  Eli’s breath puffed out in white plumes, momentarily obscuring the view of Mount Shuksan’s snow-capped peak, which usually dominated the eastern horizon from his small cabin perched precariously on the mountainside.  This morning, however, a thicker, greyer fog clung to the valleys, hinting at an early snowfall and a potentially treacherous day in the woods. The Widowmaker sputtered to life with a roar that echoed through the stillness, a sound both comforting and ominous in the isolated wilderness.  Eli climbed into the worn cab, the scent of old leather and diesel fuel filling his nostrils, a familiar aroma that felt more like home than any house ever had.  Today, he was headed deep into the old-growth forest, a place whispered about by the locals as being haunted, a place where trees grew taller than any he’d ever seen and secrets older than time itself lay buried beneath the roots.
