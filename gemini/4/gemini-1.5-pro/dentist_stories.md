The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne as he hurried across the cobbled square of Port Blossom, Maine.  Salt spray stung his cheeks, and the scent of brine and woodsmoke mingled in the air.  The sky, a bruised purple-grey, threatened snow.  Elias clutched his worn leather satchel tighter, his breath puffing out in white clouds. The colorful Victorian houses lining the square, normally cheerful beacons against the grey sea, seemed to huddle together for warmth, their brightly painted gingerbread trim offering little comfort against the gathering storm.  Elias's destination was the grandest of these houses, a three-story behemoth with a widow's walk perched precariously on its roof. The Widow Grimshaw’s house.  And while Elias was a dentist, his visit wasn't for a routine check-up.  He'd been summoned for something far more… unsettling.
