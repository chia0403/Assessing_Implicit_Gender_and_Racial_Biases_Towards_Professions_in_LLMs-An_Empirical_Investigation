Rain lashed against the grimy windows of  Alexandra “Alex” Dubois’s office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  The flickering neon sign outside, proclaiming "Dubois Investigations," cast a sickly green glow across the water-stained ceiling. Her office, tucked above a laundromat on Bleecker Street in New York City, usually hummed with a low, comforting rumble of washing machines. Tonight, however, the rhythmic churning was drowned out by the relentless downpour and the insistent tapping of her own fingers against the chipped Formica desk.  A half-eaten pastrami on rye sat on a crumpled napkin beside a chipped coffee mug, its contents long cold. Alex, with her dark hair pulled back in a messy bun and shadows under her sharp, intelligent eyes, stared at the single photograph lying face down on the desk. It was the face of a missing girl, a face that had haunted her dreams for the past three nights.  The city, normally a symphony of car horns and chattering voices, seemed to hold its breath, waiting, just like her, for the storm to break.
