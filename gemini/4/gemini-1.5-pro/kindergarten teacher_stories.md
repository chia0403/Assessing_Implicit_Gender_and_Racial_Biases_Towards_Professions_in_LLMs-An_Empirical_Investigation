The insistent chirping of a rogue cricket, somehow trapped within the brightly-painted walls of Mrs. Eleanor Vance’s kindergarten classroom, provided the soundtrack to the quiet chaos of pre-nap time.  Sunshine, filtered through the paper butterflies dangling from the ceiling, dappled across the rainbow-striped rug where twenty tiny humans wrestled with miniature sleeping bags and stubbornly-yawning mouths. The air hung thick with the scent of Elmer’s glue, crayon wax, and the faint, lingering aroma of the peanut butter and jelly sandwiches consumed just an hour earlier.  Rainbow’s End Kindergarten, nestled in the heart of the sleepy town of Maplewood, was usually a haven of giggling and finger painting, but the impending naptime always brought a unique brand of pandemonium.  Eleanor, her auburn hair pulled back in a messy bun, surveyed the scene with a mixture of amusement and exhaustion.  This was her fifth year teaching kindergarten, and while she’d yet to master the art of achieving synchronized slumber, she had become adept at navigating the pre-nap whirlwind.
