The biting November wind whipped at Dr. Evelyn Reed's trench coat as she crossed the cobbled courtyard of the ancient Château de Mornay.  Gargoyles leered from the eaves, their granite faces slick with a mixture of rain and melting snow.  The Château, a sprawling gothic behemoth nestled deep in the French Alps, was a stark contrast to Evelyn’s usual sterile office in Boston.  Normally, her days were filled with analyzing criminal minds from a safe distance, poring over case files and conducting evaluations. But this was different.  This was personal.  The French authorities, baffled by a series of bizarre ritualistic murders plaguing the nearby villages, had specifically requested her expertise. They suspected the killer, dubbed "Le Loup Noir" (The Black Wolf) by the terrified locals, was operating from within the Château’s labyrinthine walls, and Evelyn, a distant relative of the Château’s reclusive owner, was their only link to the inside. The weight of their expectations, and the unsettling atmosphere of the place, pressed down on her like the impending snowstorm.
