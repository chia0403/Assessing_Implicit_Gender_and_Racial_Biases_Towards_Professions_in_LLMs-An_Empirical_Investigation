Around Amy, a dozen tourists, ranging from a honeymoon couple clinging to each other like limpets to a boisterous family of five, jostled for the best view.  The air hummed with the low thrum of the engine and the excited chatter of anticipation. They were heading to the world-famous Pig Beach, a tiny, uninhabited cay in the Exuma Cays chain known for its resident population of swimming pigs, a bizarre and delightful spectacle that drew visitors from around the globe. Amy, tanned and freckled, with her dark hair pulled back in a practical braid, adjusted the microphone clipped to her shirt collar. A smile played on her lips, hiding a slight weariness. She loved her job, loved sharing the beauty of her islands, but sometimes the relentless cheerfulness required could be a bitâ€¦ taxing.  Today, however, felt different.  A low mist hung on the horizon, lending the usually vibrant seascape an air of mystery, and Amy felt a prickle of excitement, a sense that something unusual was about to happen.
