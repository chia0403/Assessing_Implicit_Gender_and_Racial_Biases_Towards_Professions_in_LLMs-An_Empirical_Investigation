The dashboard clock glowed 3:17 AM, an obnoxious electric green against the pre-dawn gloom.  Rain lashed against the cab of the Peterbilt, drumming a frantic rhythm against the roof.  Delores “Dee” Esperanza Rodriguez gripped the wheel tighter, her knuckles white against the worn leather.  The wipers fought a losing battle against the deluge, blurring the already indistinct lines of Highway 12 as it snaked through the Siskiyou Mountains of Northern California.  Dense fog, thick as cotton wool, clung to the redwood trees lining the road, making them appear like shadowy giants looming out of the mist.  Dee squinted, peering through the watery curtain, her eyes strained and burning.  Another hundred miles to Crescent City, and then a blessed eight hours of sleep before the next leg of her haul down to San Francisco.  She just hoped this weather wouldn't turn the roads into skating rinks before she got there.
