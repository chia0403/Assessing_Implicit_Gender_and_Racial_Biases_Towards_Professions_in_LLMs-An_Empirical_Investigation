The clatter of horse-drawn carriages on cobblestones outside barely registered with Eloise Clementine Sparrow.  Her world, contained within the cozy confines of "Sparrow & Stitch" on Lavender Lane, revolved around the whisper of silk against silk, the rhythmic click of her shears, and the gentle sigh of velvet as it draped over her dressmaker's dummy.  Lavender Lane, nestled in the heart of Victorian London, 1888, was a quiet haven, a world away from the bustling, gaslit streets of the city.  Autumn had arrived, painting the leaves of the plane trees lining the lane in shades of russet and gold, and a faint scent of woodsmoke mingled with the ever-present aroma of lavender that drifted from the overflowing window boxes of the quaint shops. Inside, bolts of fabric in every imaginable hue and texture lined the walls, a vibrant tapestry that mirrored the colourful creations Eloise brought to life.  This morning, however, a disquiet hummed beneath the usual peaceful atmosphere. A single, stark white envelope lay on her cluttered worktable, its elegant script a stark contrast to the cheerful chaos surrounding it.
