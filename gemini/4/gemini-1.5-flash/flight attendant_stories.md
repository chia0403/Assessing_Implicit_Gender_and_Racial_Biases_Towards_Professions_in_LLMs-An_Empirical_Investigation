The recycled air hung thick and faintly floral, a cloying perfume clinging to the polished chrome and muted teal of the cabin.  Amelia Grace Hawthorne, her name as meticulously arranged as the miniature silverware set before each first-class passenger, adjusted her crisp, slate-grey uniform.

Rain lashed against the fuselage of the British Airways Boeing 747, each drop a tiny, insistent hammer against the metal skin, a soundtrack to the simmering tension that had settled over the flight from London to New York.  Amelia, however, remained outwardly calm, a practiced smile playing on her lips as she glided through the aisle, her trolley a silent, gleaming weapon against the encroaching anxiety that threatened to unravel the carefully constructed facade of a transatlantic flight. This wasn't just another flight;  this was Flight BA249, and something feltâ€¦off.
