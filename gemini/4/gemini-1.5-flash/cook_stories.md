The salt spray kissed Amelia Hernandez's face as she hauled the last crate of glistening, ice-packed scallops onto the rickety dock.  The air, thick with the smell of brine and diesel, hung heavy over the fishing boats bobbing gently in the turquoise waters of Isla Mujeres.  Amelia, her dark hair plastered to her forehead and her apron splattered with seawater, wiped a hand across her brow, leaving a trail of flour and fish scales.  The sun, a molten orb sinking towards the horizon, cast long shadows across the vibrant marketplace, its cacophony of bartering and laughter slowly fading as the evening chill settled in.  This was her canvas, this chaotic, beautiful island; and tonight, Amelia would paint it with a culinary masterpiece.
