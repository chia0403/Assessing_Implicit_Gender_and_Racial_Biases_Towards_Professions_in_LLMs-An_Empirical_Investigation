The biting Montana wind howled a mournful tune around Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins's rig, a symphony of icy grit against polished chrome.  Bart, his face weathered like ancient oak bark and his eyes the pale blue of a winter sky, hunched deeper into his worn leather jacket.  The cab of his eighteen-wheeler, a battered but trusty Kenworth named Betsy, smelled of stale coffee, diesel fumes, and the faint, lingering scent of pine needles from his last delivery to a remote logging camp nestled deep in the Bitterroot Mountains.  Outside, the snow fell in thick, lazy flakes, blanketing the already snow-dusted landscape in a pristine, treacherous white.  The only sound louder than the wind was the rhythmic hum of Betsy’s engine, a steady heartbeat against the overwhelming silence of the desolate highway.  Ahead, the taillights of the vehicle in front of him, a distant, wavering crimson glow, were the only other sign of life for miles.  Bart gripped the steering wheel, his knuckles white, his gaze fixed on the road ahead – a road that stretched before him, long and unforgiving, like a promise whispered on the wind.
