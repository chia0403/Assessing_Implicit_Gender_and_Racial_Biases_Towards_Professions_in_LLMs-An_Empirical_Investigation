The rasp of Elias Thorne's plane sang a mournful song against the fragrant cedar, a counterpoint to the insistent cry of gulls overhead.  Salt spray, thick as a painter's varnish, misted the small, ramshackle workshop perched precariously on the edge of the windswept cliffs overlooking the churning grey expanse of the North Sea.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and sawdust, carried the faint, almost imperceptible tang of woodsmoke from the distant village of Port Blossom, nestled in the crook of the bay. Elias, his face weathered and lined like the ancient oak beams he often worked with, paused, his calloused hand resting on the smooth, yielding wood.  The unfinished hull of a small fishing boat, half-constructed and half-dream, lay before him, a testament to both his skill and his stubborn refusal to let the sea claim him entirely.
