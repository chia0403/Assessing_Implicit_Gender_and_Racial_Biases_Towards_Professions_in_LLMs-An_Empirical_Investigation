The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a perfume as familiar to Aurelia “Relly”  DeLuca as the squeak of her salon’s ancient barber’s chair.  Relly’s Scissors, nestled on a cobbled side street in the perpetually twilight district of Oakhaven, was a haven of mismatched furniture, overflowing plant stands, and the comforting hum of a vintage hairdryer.  Rain lashed against the mismatched windowpanes, blurring the gaslight glow of the street outside into hazy halos.  Inside, however, the salon was warm and alive, a chaotic constellation of drying hair, chattering clients, and the rhythmic snip-snip of Relly's shears – a sound that, tonight, was punctuated by the frantic tap-tap-tap of a nervous finger against the counter.
