The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume only Aurelia "Ria" Blackwood could create.  Ria, a cosmetologist whose salon, "Shear Brilliance," occupied a charming, if slightly dilapidated, Victorian storefront on Bleecker Street in New York City, sighed, a delicate plume of breath misting in the crisp October air.  Rain lashed against the tall, arched windows, blurring the already hazy gaslight glow of the street outside.  Inside, the salon was a haven of controlled chaos – the rhythmic whir of a hairdryer battling with the frantic snip-snip-snip of scissors, all punctuated by the occasional shriek of delight or a murmured complaint about a particularly stubborn cowlick.  Tonight, however, the usual cheerful hubbub was muted, the late hour and the approaching storm casting long, dramatic shadows across the plush velvet chairs and gleaming chrome styling stations.  Ria, her usually vibrant auburn hair pulled back in a practical braid, stared intently at the reflection in the cracked, antique vanity mirror, a single, worried brow furrowed beneath the gentle curve of her perfectly sculpted eyebrows – a testament to her own considerable skills.
