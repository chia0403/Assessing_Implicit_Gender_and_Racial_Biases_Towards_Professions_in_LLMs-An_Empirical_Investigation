The chipped porcelain mug warmed Seraphina "Sera" Nightingale's hands, the lukewarm tea doing little to thaw the November chill that clung to the cobblestones of Prague's Old Town Square.  A thick fog, the colour of watered-down ink, swirled around the gothic spires of TÃ½n Church, obscuring the already fading light.  Sera, bundled in a heavy wool coat far too worn for a woman of her supposed elegance (at least, according to her ever-critical mother), hunched deeper into her threadbare scarf, the damp seeping into her boots.  The melancholic strains of a distant accordion drifted across the square, a mournful counterpoint to the rhythmic clatter of horse-drawn carriages. This wasn't the glamorous backdrop she'd envisioned for her comeback; more a prelude to a very public, and possibly very frosty, failure.  But then, Prague, with its haunted beauty and whispered secrets, had always felt more like home than any opulent concert hall ever could.
