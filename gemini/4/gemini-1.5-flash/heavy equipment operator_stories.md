The pre-dawn chill bit at Elias Thorneâ€™s exposed cheeks, even through the thick wool of his scarf.  His breath plumed white in the frigid Alaskan air, mirroring the ghostly exhalations of the massive Caterpillar D11T idling beside him.  The machine, affectionately nicknamed "The Beast" by Elias and the rest of the crew, was a behemoth of steel and hydraulics, its tracks leaving deep, serrated furrows in the frozen earth of the Yukon goldfields.  The sky, a bruised purple and deepening indigo, promised another day of bone-jarring work extracting the stubborn, glittering ore from the unforgiving landscape.  The air hung heavy with the scent of diesel fumes and the faint, metallic tang of thawing permafrost.  This was Elias's world; a landscape of frozen rivers, windswept plains, and the relentless grind of extracting wealth from the earth, one bucketful at a time.
