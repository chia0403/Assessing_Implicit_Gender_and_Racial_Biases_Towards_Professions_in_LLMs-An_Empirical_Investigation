The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful song around Captain Elara Vanceâ€™s battered Cessna 185, its icy breath frosting the already-pristine snow blanketing the Denali National Park.  The sun, a pale disc barely peeking over the jagged Chugach Mountains, cast long, skeletal shadows that danced with the swirling snow devils.  Elara, her breath misting in the frigid air, checked her instruments one last time.  The altimeter needle trembled slightly, a nervous tic mirroring the flutter in her own chest.  Below, the vast, untamed wilderness stretched out like a rumpled, snow-covered blanket, a landscape both breathtaking and terrifyingly unforgiving.  This wasn't just another flight; this was a lifeline, a desperate race against a dwindling daylight and a storm gathering its strength in the west.
