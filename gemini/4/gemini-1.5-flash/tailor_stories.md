The scent of beeswax and lavender hung heavy in the air, a comforting counterpoint to the biting November wind rattling the single pane windows of Elias Thorne's tailor shop.  Elias, a man whose hands were as nimble as a hummingbird's wings and whose eyes held the patient wisdom of a seasoned craftsman, meticulously stitched a seam on a bespoke tweed jacket.  The shop itself, nestled on a cobbled side street in the ancient, perpetually-grey city of Porthaven, was a haven of quiet industry.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight that pierced the gloom, illuminating shelves laden with bolts of vibrant silks, muted wools, and the glint of countless needles and thimbles.  Outside, the mournful cry of gulls mingled with the rumble of distant carts, a familiar soundtrack to Elias's solitary life.
