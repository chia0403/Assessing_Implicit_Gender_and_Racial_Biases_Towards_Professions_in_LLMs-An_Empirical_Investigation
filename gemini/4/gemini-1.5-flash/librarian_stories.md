The scent of aged paper and leather, a perfume both comforting and slightly melancholic, hung heavy in the air of the Blackwood County Library.  Dust motes, illuminated by the afternoon sun slanting through the tall, arched windows, danced in the stillness.

Her spectacles, perched precariously on her nose, magnified the intensity of her gaze as she meticulously catalogued a newly donated collection of Victorian-era botany texts, their brittle pages whispering secrets of long-dead flowers.  The library, a grand old edifice built of grey stone and whispering secrets of its own, felt less like a workplace and more like a sanctuary, a place where Eleanor could lose herself in the hushed company of stories untold and knowledge yet to be discovered.
