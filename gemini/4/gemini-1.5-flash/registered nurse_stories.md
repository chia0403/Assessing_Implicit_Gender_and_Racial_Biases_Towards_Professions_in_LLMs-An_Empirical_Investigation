The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s auburn hair across her face as she hurried down the rain-slicked street, the collar of her worn raincoat pulled high.  The neon glow of "Mercy General" pulsed across the wet asphalt, casting a sickly yellow light on the puddles reflecting the city’s grimy skyline.  The air hung thick with the smells of exhaust fumes and something else, something subtly acrid, that Amelia instinctively recognised – the metallic tang of blood, faint but unmistakable, clinging to the damp night.  She pushed open the heavy glass doors of the emergency room, the warmth washing over her like a sigh of relief, a stark contrast to the chill that had settled deep in her bones, a chill that had nothing to do with the weather.  Inside, the usual chaotic symphony of beeping monitors and hurried footsteps played out, a familiar yet always unsettling soundtrack to her life as a registered nurse at Mercy General.
