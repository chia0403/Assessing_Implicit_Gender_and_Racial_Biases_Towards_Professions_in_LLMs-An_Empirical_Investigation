The November wind, a razor-edged thing, sliced through the gaps in Dr. Alistair Finch’s ill-fitting window frames.  He shivered, not entirely from the cold.  The chill that settled deep in his bones originated from the flickering gaslight casting long, skeletal shadows across his sparsely furnished waiting room.  Rain lashed against the leaded panes, a relentless percussion accompanying the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner – a clock that, Alistair suspected, was as old as the building itself.  This wasn't the gleaming, sterile environment of a modern dental practice; this was Finch & Sons, established 1888, a relic of a bygone era perched precariously on the edge of Blackwood Moor, a place where whispers of forgotten magic clung to the peat-stained soil and the gnarled branches of ancient oaks.  The scent of woodsmoke and something faintly…metallic…hung heavy in the air.  Tonight, Alistair expected no patients, only the lingering unease that had become his constant companion since…the incident.
