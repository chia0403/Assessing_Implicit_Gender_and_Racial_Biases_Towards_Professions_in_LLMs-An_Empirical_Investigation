The biting November wind whipped Amelia Katherine Hayes's dark hair across her face as she hurried down the cobbled street, the collar of her worn peacoat pulled high.  Rain, sleeting now, plastered her already dampened scrubs to her skin.  The air hung thick with the smell of woodsmoke and something else, something metallic and faintly sweet, that prickled at the back of her throat.  This was Oakhaven, population 872, a town clinging stubbornly to the edge of the desolate, windswept moors of Northumberland.  Its single street, lined with stone cottages draped in ivy, was currently deserted save for a scattering of sodden leaves and the occasional skittish cat darting between overflowing bins.  Amelia, however, was far from deserted.  Tonight, she carried the weight of the entire town's fragile health on her shoulders, a weight heavier than any winter storm.
