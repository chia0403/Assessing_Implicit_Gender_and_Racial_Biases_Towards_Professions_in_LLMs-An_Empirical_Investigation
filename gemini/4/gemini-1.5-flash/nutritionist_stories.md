The chipped paint of the waiting room's nautical-themed mural – a rather jaundiced depiction of a perpetually surprised dolphin – did little to soothe Dr. Eleanor Vance's frayed nerves.  Eleanor Vance, PhD, Registered Dietitian, and certified nutritional therapist, felt the familiar thrum of anxiety building in her chest.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and something vaguely floral that smelled suspiciously like air freshener attempting to mask the lingering aroma of desperation.  This wasn't her usual clientele – the Pilates-loving, kale-smoothie-guzzling, health-conscious set who frequented her upscale practice in the city.  No, this was the Coastal Serenity Wellness Center, a small, slightly rundown facility tucked away on the windswept cliffs of Mendocino, California, and today's appointment was anything but typical.  The relentless Pacific roared outside, a counterpoint to the nervous silence within the waiting room, punctuated only by the occasional creak of the floorboards.
