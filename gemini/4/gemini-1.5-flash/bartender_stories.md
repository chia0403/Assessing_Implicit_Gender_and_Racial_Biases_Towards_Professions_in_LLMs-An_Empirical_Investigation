The chipped Formica countertop felt cool beneath Elias Thorne’s forearms as he meticulously polished a glass, the rhythmic swirl a counterpoint to the low thrum of conversation in The Rusty Mug.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the neon glow of the liquor store across the alley into a hazy, orange smear.  Inside, the air hung thick with the smells of stale beer, spilled whiskey, and something vaguely floral – probably the desperate attempt of a single, wilting carnation clinging to life in a cracked vase on the bar.  Elias, a man whose face bore the map of a life lived mostly in shadows, didn't bother to correct the arrangement.  He’d seen worse attempts at beauty, both inside and outside of The Rusty Mug.  Tonight, however, even the usual Friday night chaos felt muted, subdued by the relentless drumming of the rain.  It was the kind of night that promised secrets, the kind Elias Thorne was exceptionally good at keeping – and uncovering.
