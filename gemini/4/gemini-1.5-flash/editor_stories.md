The chipped mug warmed Amelia Blackwood's hands, the lukewarm tea doing little to soothe the icy dread that had settled in her stomach.  Rain lashed against the tall, gothic windows of her office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  The garret room, perched atop the creaking old building that housed Blackwood & Sons Publishing, was a chaotic symphony of overflowing bookshelves, precarious stacks of manuscripts, and the faint, lingering scent of old paper and pipe tobacco.  Dust motes danced in the weak light filtering through the grime-coated panes, illuminating a scene of organized chaos – Amelia’s preferred working environment, usually.  Tonight, however, the comforting familiarity felt stifling, a pressure cooker primed to explode.  The manuscript on her desk, bound in worn leather and smelling faintly of lavender and something decidedly unpleasant (perhaps fear?), was the ticking time bomb.  It was titled *The Obsidian Mirror*, and Amelia suspected it held the key to more than just a gripping gothic thriller.
