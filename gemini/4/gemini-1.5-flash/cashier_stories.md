The fluorescent hum of the "Quick Stop & Shop" lights buzzed a monotonous rhythm against the clatter of Elara Vance's cash register.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the already indistinct neon signs of the neighbouring businesses into streaks of lurid colour.  The air inside smelled faintly of stale coffee, damp wool, and the lingering sweetness of a spilled bottle of cherry soda â€“ a perfume uniquely Quick Stop & Shop.  Elara, her dark braid coiled neatly at the nape of her neck, tapped a weary finger on the counter, her gaze drifting to the swirling vortex of water collecting in the overflowing gutter outside. Another Tuesday night, another relentless downpour, another seemingly endless shift at the only job she could find in this forgotten corner of Oakhaven.
