The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s hair across her face, stinging her cheeks a fiery red.  She pulled her worn, wool scarf tighter, the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves clinging to it like a second skin.  Around her, the sprawling grounds of Blackwood Manor – a gothic monstrosity of crumbling stone and shadowed turrets – groaned under the weight of the approaching storm.  The air, thick with the pre-winter chill, held a strange, almost expectant silence, broken only by the mournful caw of a distant crow and the rhythmic thud of Amelia’s own boots on the gravel path.  Her destination: the dilapidated aviary, its skeletal frame a testament to years of neglect, home to Blackwood Manor’s surprisingly resilient collection of exotic birds.  Amelia, head animal caretaker and sole guardian of these feathered residents, knew tonight would be a long one.
