The air hung thick and sweet, a cloying blend of blood and sawdust, clinging to the worn leather apron of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield.  Barty, a man whose hands were as capable of coaxing tenderness from a prime rib roast as they were of wielding a cleaver with terrifying precision, stood amidst the chill of Butterfield's Meats, his family's butcher shop.  The shop, nestled on the cobbled side street of Grimsborough's Old Town, was a relic of a bygone era, its walls lined with hooks gleaming under the single, flickering gaslight that struggled to pierce the pre-dawn gloom.  Outside, the fog, thick as pea soup, clung to the crooked buildings, muffling the distant rumble of the city's waking.  The only sounds within the shop were the rhythmic drip, drip, drip of melting fat from a recently butchered pig and the soft creak of Barty's worn boots on the polished wooden floor.  This was his domain, a kingdom of cold steel and rich aromas, and today, something feltâ€¦ different.  A tension, subtle yet undeniable, hung heavier than the fog outside.
