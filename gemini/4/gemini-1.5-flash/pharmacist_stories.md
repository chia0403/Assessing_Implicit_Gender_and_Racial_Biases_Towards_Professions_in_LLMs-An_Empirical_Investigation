The chipped porcelain sink in the back room of Finchley's Pharmacy groaned under the weight of Elara Josephine Finchley's elbows.  The air hung thick with the scent of lavender and something faintly acrid – likely a spilled bottle of iodine somewhere in the labyrinthine back stock. Rain lashed against the single, grime-streaked window overlooking the cobbled alleyway, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Elara.  The pharmacy itself, a cramped Victorian relic sandwiched between a failing butcher's and a surprisingly trendy vegan bakery, felt less like a place of healing and more like a suffocating pressure cooker.  Dust motes danced in the weak light filtering through the stained-glass panels depicting – ironically – healthy, vibrant herbs.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune, a fitting accompaniment to the gnawing unease that had settled in Elara's stomach since the cryptic note arrived that morning.
