The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s hair across her face as she hurried down Elm Street, the scent of woodsmoke and damp leaves clinging to the air.  Rain, a fine, persistent drizzle, plastered her bright yellow raincoat to her thin frame.  Ahead, nestled between a Victorian-era bakery with its perpetually steaming windows and a quirky antique shop overflowing with forgotten treasures, stood Sunnyside Daycare – a cheerful, if slightly dilapidated, yellow clapboard building that felt less like a daycare and more like a slightly chaotic, over-caffeinated beehive.  Inside, Amelia knew, lay a symphony of tiny voices, the rhythmic thump of tiny feet, and the ever-present aroma of spilled juice and slightly-too-sweet cookies.  Tonight, however, the usual happy chaos felt weighted with a different kind of energy, a nervous hum that vibrated through the very floorboards.  A new child was starting tomorrow, and the whispers about him – a child who rarely spoke, and whose eyes held a depth far too old for his years – had already begun to weave themselves into the fabric of Sunnyside's daily rhythm.
