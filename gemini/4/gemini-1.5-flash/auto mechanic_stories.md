Elias, his knuckles perpetually stained black, wrestled with a stubborn distributor cap on a 1967 Mustang Fastback, its cherry-red paint dulled by years of neglect.

Outside, the Nevada desert sun beat down on the ramshackle collection of vehicles crammed into his yard – a graveyard of automotive ghosts awaiting resurrection.  Dust devils danced in the heat haze shimmering off the cracked asphalt of the driveway, and the only sound louder than Elias's grunts of exertion was the distant, mournful wail of a coyote.
