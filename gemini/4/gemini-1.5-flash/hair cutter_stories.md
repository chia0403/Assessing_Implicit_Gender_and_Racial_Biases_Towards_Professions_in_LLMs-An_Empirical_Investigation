The scent of lavender and ozone hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume only a barber shop could conjure.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single, bare bulb swinging above the worn leather chair, danced in the late afternoon sun slanting through the grimy window of "Shear Perfection."  This wasn't your sleek, modern salon;  Shear Perfection was a relic, all chipped porcelain sinks, faded floral wallpaper, and the low hum of a decades-old electric clipper.  Behind the worn wooden counter, meticulously arranging a scattering of combs and scissors, sat Elias Thorne, his fingers, long and nimble, bearing the faintest trace of dye from a thousand different hair colours.  The bell above the door jingled, a discordant chime that cut through the quiet hum of the shop, promising the arrival of another soul needing Elias's particular brand of calm and precision.
