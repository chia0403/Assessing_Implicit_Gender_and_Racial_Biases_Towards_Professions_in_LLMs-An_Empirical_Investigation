The chipped paint of Room 203 peeled like sunburnt skin, mirroring the weary exhaustion etched onto Ms. Eleanor Vance’s face.  It was the last day of school before summer break, a day usually brimming with the chaotic energy of a hundred pent-up children, but today, a thick, humid stillness hung in the air, heavy as the scent of overripe peaches from the nearby orchard.  Outside, the relentless Georgia sun beat down on the brick walls of Oakhaven Elementary, baking the playground equipment into shimmering, unbearable heat.  Even the usually boisterous cicadas seemed subdued, their incessant chirping replaced by a listless drone.  Inside, the room felt like an oven, the air thick with the lingering scent of glue, crayons, and the faint, almost imperceptible tang of impending disaster.  Eleanor sighed, running a hand through her already frazzled auburn braid, the weight of a particularly challenging year settling heavily on her shoulders.  This wasn’t just the end of the school year; it felt like the end of something else entirely.
