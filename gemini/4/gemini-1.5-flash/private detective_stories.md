The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Jack Stratton's office, a relentless rhythm mirroring the persistent ache in his left shoulder.  It wasn't a new ache, not exactly.  More of a familiar companion, a dull throb that reminded him of the last time he'd tangled with a particularly unpleasant loan shark in a back alley – an encounter that had left him with a bruised ego and a surprisingly resilient limp.  Jack, his trench coat damp and clinging to his frame, nursed a lukewarm cup of coffee, the bitter taste doing little to alleviate the grim atmosphere of his office. This wasn't a swanky downtown establishment, but a cramped space above a failing laundromat in the grimy underbelly of Seattle's Belltown district.  The air hung thick with the scent of wet wool, stale coffee, and something vaguely resembling desperation – a scent Jack Stratton was intimately familiar with.
