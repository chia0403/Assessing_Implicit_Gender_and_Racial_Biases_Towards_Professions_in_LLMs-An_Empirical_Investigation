The fluorescent lights of the drafting room hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic scratch of Elias Thorne's pencil on Mylar.  Dust motes, illuminated in the harsh glare, danced in the stagnant air above his meticulously organized desk.  Elias, a man whose life seemed as precisely measured as the architectural blueprints spread before him, meticulously shaded a section of the proposed atrium for the new city hall â€“ a soaring glass and steel structure that, in his more cynical moments, he suspected would collapse under the weight of its own ambition.  The air conditioning wheezed, a symphony of mechanical sighs accompanying the quiet click-clack of his drafting tools, a familiar soundtrack to his solitary existence. Outside, the relentless Chicago wind howled a far less predictable melody, a reminder of the chaotic world beyond the sterile confines of his workspace.
