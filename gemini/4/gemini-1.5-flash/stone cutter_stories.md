The rasp of granite against steel, a sound as familiar to Elias Thorne as the beat of his own heart, echoed through the cavernous workshop.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single shaft of afternoon sunlight piercing the grimy window, danced in the air like tiny, frantic spirits.  Elias, his hands calloused and stained the ochre of the earth itself, paused his work, the rhythmic scratch momentarily silenced.  The air, thick with the scent of wet stone and woodsmoke from the forge in the corner, hung heavy and still. Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune against the granite cliffs that ringed the isolated village of Oakhaven, a fitting counterpoint to the brooding silence that had settled over Elias and his half-finished masterpiece â€“ a towering angel, its wings seemingly poised for flight, yet forever grounded in the cold, unforgiving stone.
