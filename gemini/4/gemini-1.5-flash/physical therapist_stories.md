The salt spray stung Dr. Eleanor Vanceâ€™s face as she wrestled the stubborn fishing net from the tangled kelp.  The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum sinking below the jagged horizon of the Maine coast, cast long shadows across the rocky shore.

Eleanor, her hands raw and chapped despite the thick work gloves, finally freed the net, revealing a struggling lobster trapped within its suffocating embrace.  It wasn't the patient she'd expected to treat this evening, but the rugged beauty of the coastline, the raw, untamed energy of the ocean, always held a strange, restorative quality that mirrored the work she did, mending broken bodies and spirits alike.  This tiny fishing village of Port Blossom, nestled between the unforgiving sea and the whispering pines, was both her sanctuary and her challenge.
