The salt spray stung Officer Amelia “Amy” Hernandez’s face as the November wind howled a mournful tune across the desolate expanse of Duxbury Beach.  The sky, a bruised purple bruised by the setting sun, mirrored the turmoil churning in her gut.  Her patrol car, a battered Ford Explorer nicknamed "The Whale" by her cynical partner (who was currently off-duty, thankfully), was parked precariously close to the dune line, its headlights cutting feeble swathes through the encroaching darkness.  The only sounds louder than the wind were the rhythmic crash of waves against the shore and the frantic, desperate cries of gulls overhead, a soundtrack to the grim scene unfolding before her. A lone, overturned fishing boat, half-buried in the sand, lay stark against the darkening horizon, its mast snapped like a twig. And near it, something that wasn't supposed to be there. Something that made Amy's heart clench in a cold, hard knot of dread.
