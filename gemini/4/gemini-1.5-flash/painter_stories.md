The salt spray stung Aurelia Blackwoodâ€™s face, a familiar kiss from the unforgiving Atlantic.  The wind, a relentless sculptor, whipped her auburn hair across her canvas, threatening to smear the still-wet oils of the churning grey sea.  She hunched deeper into her worn oilskins, the rough fabric a stark contrast to the delicate brushstrokes she was attempting to capture.  The craggy cliffs of Cornwall, their granite faces etched by centuries of wind and wave, rose behind her, a dramatic backdrop to the tempestuous scene unfolding before her.  Aurelia, a woman whose spirit mirrored the wildness of the ocean she painted, squinted, her eyes the same shade of stormy grey as the sky above.  This was her sanctuary, this windswept headland known locally as Widow's Point, a place where the roar of the sea drowned out the whispers of doubt that sometimes haunted her soul.
