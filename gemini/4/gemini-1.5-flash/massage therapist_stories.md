The scent of sandalwood and lavender hung heavy in the air, a comforting balm against the relentless downpour lashing against the leaded-glass windows of Serenity Now Massage Therapy. Rain hammered a frantic rhythm on the slate roof, a counterpoint to the soft, rhythmic kneading of Elara Vance's hands. Elara, her fingers deftly working the knotted muscles in her clientâ€™s upper back, felt the tension drain away not only from the woman beneath her, but from herself as well.  The flickering candlelight cast dancing shadows across the room, illuminating the warm, earthy tones of the walls and the plush, inviting massage table.  Outside, the storm raged, a chaotic symphony of wind and water; inside, Serenity Now was an island of calm, a sanctuary built on the promise of soothing touch and quiet escape.
