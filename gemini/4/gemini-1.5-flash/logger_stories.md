The biting wind whipped at Elias Thorne's beard, stinging his cheeks raw.  The air hung thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, a familiar aroma that usually brought a sense of comfort, but today, it felt oppressive, heavy with the weight of unspoken dread. Elias, his face weathered like ancient bark itself, stood at the edge of the Whispering Pines, a vast, ancient forest that clawed its way up the slopes of Mount Cinder, its peaks shrouded in a perpetual twilight.  The sun, a weak, watery disc, struggled to pierce the thick canopy, casting long, skeletal shadows across the snow-dusted ground.  This wasn't just any logging job; this was the heart of the Whispering Pines, a place whispered about in hushed tones by the older loggers â€“ a place where the trees themselves seemed to hold their breath.
