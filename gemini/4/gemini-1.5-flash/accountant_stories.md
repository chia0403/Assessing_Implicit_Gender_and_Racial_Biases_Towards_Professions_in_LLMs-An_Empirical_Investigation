The chipped paint of the fire escape flaked onto Amelia “Amy” Hernandez’s crisp white blouse, a tiny, ironic snowfall on a July afternoon.

Inside, amidst a chaotic jumble of tax forms, half-eaten takeout containers, and meticulously organized spreadsheets, lay the source of her current turmoil: a ledger detailing a suspiciously large discrepancy in the accounts of her most important client, a charismatic but notoriously secretive art collector named Julian Thorne.  Amy, a meticulous accountant with an almost obsessive attention to detail, knew something was terribly wrong.
