The chipped porcelain teacup trembled in Seraphina “Sera” Blackwood’s hand, mirroring the tremor of anxiety in her chest.  Rain lashed against the leaded-glass windows of her tiny, cluttered office, a space perched precariously above the perpetually damp alley behind the Grand Majestic Theatre.  The air hung thick with the scent of aged wood, damp plaster, and the faint, lingering perfume of a thousand past performances – a heady, almost suffocating blend that Sera usually found comforting, but tonight, it only amplified her unease.  Empty coffee cups and discarded script pages littered the worn mahogany desk, a testament to the relentless weeks she'd spent wrestling with "The Serpent's Kiss," her ambitious new production, a gothic melodrama that threatened to devour her whole.  The Grand Majestic itself, a crumbling monument to a bygone era of theatrical glory, seemed to hold its breath alongside her, its majestic façade obscured by the relentless downpour.
