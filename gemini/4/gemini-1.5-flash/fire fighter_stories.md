The acrid bite of woodsmoke clung to Lieutenant Elias Thorneâ€™s throat, a familiar companion on nights like these.  He coughed, the sound swallowed by the roar of the inferno consuming the old Blackwood Pines campground.  Flames, orange and malevolent, licked at the skeletal remains of cabins, their charred timbers groaning under the relentless assault.  The air thrummed with the chaotic symphony of crackling fire, the hiss of water cannons, and the shouts of his crew, their voices strained against the wind whipping through the ravaged pines.  This wasn't a controlled burn gone wrong; this was something... else.  An unnatural ferocity fueled the blaze, a heat so intense it seemed to warp the very air itself, leaving Elias with the unsettling feeling that he was fighting not just fire, but something far more ancient and sinister.  The moon, a skeletal fingernail in the smoke-choked sky, cast long, dancing shadows that seemed to writhe and twist, mirroring the chaotic energy of the fire.
