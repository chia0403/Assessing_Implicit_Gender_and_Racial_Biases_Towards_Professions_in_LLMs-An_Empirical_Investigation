The November rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the probation office, a relentless drumming that mirrored the persistent ache in Amelia “Mia” Hernandez’s head.  The air inside hung thick with the smell of stale coffee and desperation – a familiar, cloying aroma that clung to the worn, mustard-yellow walls like a second skin. Mia, a probation officer with five years of experience etched onto her face in the form of fine lines around her eyes and a permanent furrow in her brow, slumped back in her creaking chair, the chipped mug of lukewarm coffee growing cold in her hand. Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune, whipping stray leaves into frenzied dances across the bleak, windswept parking lot of the city's sprawling, underfunded community services building.  Tonight, the city felt particularly unforgiving, a fitting backdrop to the case file she held, its pages already damp from the persistent drizzle that had seeped through her worn leather briefcase.  The name on the top page:  Ricardo Alvarez.  His probation hearing was in the morning, and Mia had a sinking feeling this one wasn’t going to go smoothly.
