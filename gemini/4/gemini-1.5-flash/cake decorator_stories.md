The scent of almond extract hung heavy in the air, a sweet, cloying perfume clinging to the damp chill of a November morning in Edinburgh.  Rain lashed against the mismatched panes of  "The Sugarplum Fairy," a tiny, almost impossibly cramped cake shop tucked away on a cobbled lane off the Royal Mile.  Inside, amidst a chaotic flurry of sugar flowers, piping bags overflowing with buttercream, and half-finished masterpieces shimmering under the harsh fluorescent lights, Amelia Grace Hawthorne meticulously smoothed the final layer of fondant onto a three-tiered wedding cake.  The cake, a breathtaking confection of ivory and blush pink, was almost as breathtaking as the view of Edinburgh Castle, partially obscured by the driving rain, visible through the shop's grimy window.  Amelia, her brow furrowed in concentration, was utterly oblivious to both the storm raging outside and the growing sense of unease that was beginning to prickle at the edges of her usually calm demeanor.  This wasn't just any wedding cake; this was the cake for the Laird of Dunvegan's daughter, and Amelia knew that anything less than perfection would beâ€¦ disastrous.
