The fluorescent lights of the St. Jude's Medical Center phlebotomy lab hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* of Amelia Hernandez's own heart.  It wasn't the usual pre-shift jitters; Amelia, a phlebotomist with seven years under her belt, rarely felt nervous anymore.  But today was different. The air crackled with a strange tension, a palpable unease that clung to the sterile scent of antiseptic and the faint metallic tang of blood.  Outside, the relentless San Antonio sun beat down on the parched Texas landscape, a stark contrast to the cool, clinical environment within.  Amelia adjusted the collar of her crisp white lab coat, the embroidered name "Amelia Hernandez, RPT" a small, almost apologetic declaration in the vast, echoing space. Today, however, the name felt heavier than usual, burdened by a premonition she couldn't quite shake.
