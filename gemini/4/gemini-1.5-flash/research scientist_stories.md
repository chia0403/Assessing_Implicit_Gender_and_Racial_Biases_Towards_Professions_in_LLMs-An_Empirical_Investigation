The biting Antarctic wind howled like a banshee, tearing at the seams of Dr. Evelyn Grace Holloway's parka.  Ice crystals, sharp as shards of glass, stung her exposed cheeks despite the heavy balaclava.  Evelyn, a glaciologist with the British Antarctic Survey, hunched deeper into her thermal layers, the biting chill seeping into her bones despite the layers of protection.  The research station, Halley VI, a futuristic-looking structure perched precariously on hydraulic legs above the shifting ice shelf, felt miles away, a lonely beacon in the vast, white expanse.  Tonight, however, the station wasn't just distant; it was unreachable. A sudden, violent blizzard, a monster born of the unforgiving Antarctic wilderness, had descended without warning, burying the landscape under a swirling shroud of snow and obscuring all visibility beyond a few desperate meters.  Evelyn, separated from the station during a routine ice core sample retrieval, was alone, utterly alone, in the unforgiving heart of the Antarctic.
