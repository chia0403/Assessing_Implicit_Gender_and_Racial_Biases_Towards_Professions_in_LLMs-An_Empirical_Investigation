The air hung heavy with the scent of dry sagebrush and the distant, metallic tang of impending rain.  He adjusted the brim of his worn Stetson, the leather creaking a familiar song in the gathering twilight.  The silence, broken only by the wind's mournful sigh, held a tension that even Cal, a man hardened by years of solitude and hardship, couldn't quite ignore.
