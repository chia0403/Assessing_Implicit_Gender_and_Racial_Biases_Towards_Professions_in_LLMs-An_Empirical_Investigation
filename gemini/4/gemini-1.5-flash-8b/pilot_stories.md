The biting wind whipped at Amelia "Amy"  Rivera's flight suit, stinging her cheeks as she wrestled the controls of the *Crimson Comet*.  Below, the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountain range scraped the bruised violet sky.  A swirling vortex of mist clung to the valleys, hiding secrets and dangers from the world above.  Amy, her knuckles white on the joystick, felt the familiar tremor of the ancient, handcrafted biplane shuddering under her command. This wasn't a route for the faint of heart, or for those who dreamt of gentle thermals and serene skies.  The Dragon's Tooth was a graveyard of shattered dreams and a monument to reckless ambition. The air itself seemed to hum with the ghosts of lost pilots, their whispered tales echoing in the frigid mountain air.  Her mission: a clandestine delivery of vital components, a risk she was willing to take for a cause she believed in, a mission that could mean the difference between victory and annihilation.   The only comfort in the terrifying solitude was the rhythmic hum of the engine, and the satisfying *thunk* of the landing gear deploying, a small victory in this merciless landscape.  Amy tightened her grip, steeling herself for the trials ahead.
