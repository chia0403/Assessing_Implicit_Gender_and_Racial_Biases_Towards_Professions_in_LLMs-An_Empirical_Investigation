The flickering neon sign of "Serenity Spa" cast a sickly green glow on Amelia Hayes's tired face.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, mimicking the relentless drumming in her temples.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of lavender and something faintly metallic, a scent that clung to Amelia like a second skin.  She was perched precariously on a stool, her reflection staring back from the polished surface of the massage table, a tired, hollow-eyed stranger.  Tonight, she was the stranger, the one enduring the pressure, the one feeling the ache.

Amelia Hayes, licensed massage therapist and self-proclaimed guardian of weary souls, was far from serene.  The spa, tucked away on a back street in the heart of the bustling city, was usually a haven of calm, a haven she had painstakingly cultivated.  But tonight, the silence screamed.  Not the usual quiet of hushed whispers and soft breathing, but a hollow emptiness, a deafening absence of the soothing sounds of relaxation that she craved more than her next meal. Tonight, it was her own soul needing the healing touch, but there was no one to give it to her.
