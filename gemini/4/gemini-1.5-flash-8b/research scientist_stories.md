The flickering fluorescent lights of the lab hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic click-clack of Dr. Aris Thorne's boots on the sterile, white tile floor.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grime-coated windows of the abandoned bio-research facility, illuminating a cluttered workbench.  Empty petri dishes, stacked precariously, whispered secrets of failed experiments.  Aris, his brow furrowed in concentration, meticulously documented data from a series of bizarre, almost otherworldly, growth patterns in a faded notebook.  The facility, a relic of a long-forgotten era of unchecked scientific ambition, now stood silent and forgotten, save for the echoes of Aris's persistent inquiries.  Its once-grand halls, now cavernous and echoing, contained not only the lingering scent of formaldehyde and decay, but also the faint, almost palpable, sense of something...else.  This particular facility, tucked away deep within the Nevada desert, had been closed down twenty years prior, following a series of highly unusual and inexplicable incidents, but Aris, drawn by whispers of a previously-unidentified fungal species, believed he could uncover clues to its demise.
