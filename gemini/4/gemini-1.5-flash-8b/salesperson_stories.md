The fluorescent lights of the "Everything for the Home" megastore hummed, a relentless, synthesized drone that mirrored the steady rhythm of Amelia Butterfield's life.  Amelia, a third-year salesperson in the kitchenware aisle, felt the familiar pang of mid-afternoon slump.  The air hung thick with the scent of unwashed plastic and slightly stale coffee; a cacophony of clattering carts, excited children, and the exasperated sighs of harried shoppers surrounded her.  Today, Amelia’s sales had been as predictable as the store's daily specials –  a dishearteningly low number.  The beige walls, lined with rows upon rows of gleaming, seemingly identical cookware sets, felt like they were closing in on her, mirroring the suffocating monotony of her job.

The setting was the sprawling, cavernous "Everything for the Home" megastore, a sprawling concrete behemoth that dominated the southern edge of Oakhaven.  Rows of identical beige cinder block walls stretched endlessly, lined with the predictable aisles of the store's inventory. From the towering shelves overflowing with cutlery and crockery to the dimly lit appliance section tucked into the back of the store, everything was designed for maximum efficiency, minimum individuality.  The endless fluorescent lights buzzed, the only music provided by the occasional ringing of cash registers and the distant rumble of trucks loading and unloading supplies in the cavernous loading docks.  Oakhaven itself was a quiet, suburban town, where the megastore acted as a focal point for the community, and a barometer of their needs and desires, whether or not they were truly being fulfilled.
