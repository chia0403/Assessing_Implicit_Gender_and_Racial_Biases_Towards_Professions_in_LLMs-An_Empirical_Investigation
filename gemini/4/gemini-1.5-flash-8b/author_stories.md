The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Blackwood's hands, a meagre comfort against the biting November wind that howled through the gaps in the boarded-up windows of her tiny flat above the bookstore.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless percussion that mirrored the relentless drumbeat of deadlines in her head. Amelia, a writer of historical fiction, stared out at the grey, swirling cityscape, the faded posters of forgotten bands and now-defunct theatre productions plastered to the brick walls seeming to mock her own creative struggles.  Her current project, a novel set during the 1888 Jack the Ripper murders, was proving particularly stubborn.  The characters felt like ghosts, their motivations as elusive as the fog clinging to the Thames.  Her apartment, a cramped space smelling perpetually of old paper and damp wool, was as much a part of the story as the cobbled streets and gas lamps she so meticulously described.  The tiny kitchen, barely large enough for a single table and a battered writing desk, felt like a tomb, its only illumination the flickering light of a single bulb hanging precariously above her head.
