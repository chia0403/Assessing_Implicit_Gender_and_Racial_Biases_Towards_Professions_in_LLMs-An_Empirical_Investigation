The fluorescent lights of the high school cafeteria hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to the clatter of trays and the low murmur of teenage voices.  Rain hammered against the warped metal awning, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Amelia Grace Peterson, guidance counselor extraordinaire.  Amelia, perpetually perched on the edge of her chair in Room 217, felt the familiar, unsettling prickle of dread.  Today was the day. The day she’d been dreading for weeks, the day that student, the one she’d known since freshman year, the one whose quiet intensity was both captivating and terrifying, was finally going to ask.

Setting:

The bustling, yet oddly sterile, high school cafeteria, bathed in the harsh glow of fluorescent lights.  The scent of cafeteria food, a mixture of mystery meat and stale French fries, hung heavy in the air.  Outside, the early autumn rain was relentless, drumming a frantic rhythm against the faded metal awning that stretched over the concrete courtyard.  Inside Room 217, Amelia’s guidance office, the pastel walls were painted over with years of sticky notes and motivational posters that had long lost their pep.  A stack of unprocessed student files loomed, a tangible representation of the countless problems awaiting Amelia. A worn, leather-bound journal, filled with cryptic notes, lay open on her desk.
