The steam, thick and greasy, hung heavy in the air of "The Rusty Kettle," clinging to the chipped paint of the walls and the flickering gaslights that cast long, dancing shadows across the rough-hewn tables.  Amelia Juniper, a cook with hands as dark and seasoned as the mahogany of the bar, expertly flipped a flapjack, the delicate batter sizzled and puffed.  The aroma of cinnamon and maple syrup mingled with the pungent smell of garlic and frying onions, a symphony of scents that was both comforting and overwhelming.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune against the ancient timbers of the inn, a constant reminder of the harsh, unforgiving winter that gripped the valley.  The only sounds besides the sizzling food were the rhythmic clinking of mugs and the low murmur of conversations, a comforting hum in the otherwise lonely inn. Amelia, though, was more accustomed to the quiet solitude of the kitchen than the chatter of guests. Tonight, though, there was an air of anticipation, a nervous energy in the air, a feeling she couldn't quite place. Tonight, something was different.  The valley had always felt a little uneasy, a quiet rumble of something brewing under the surface.
