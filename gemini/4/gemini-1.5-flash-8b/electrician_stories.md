The flickering fluorescent lights of the abandoned factory hummed a mournful tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Amelia Blackwood's boots on the cracked concrete floor. Dust motes danced in the single shaft of pale sunlight slicing through a gaping hole in the roof, illuminating a labyrinth of rusted machinery and forgotten dreams.  Amelia, a seasoned electrician with calloused hands and eyes that saw voltage in the shadows, traced a chipped paint line with a worn forefinger.  This was Unit 7, a forgotten wing of the once-mighty "Apex Industries," a place whispered about in hushed tones by the locals as the site of a catastrophic fire decades ago. Now, only scavengers and the occasional, intrepid paranormal investigator dared to tread these desolate halls.

Amelia Blackwood, her name a subtle echo of strength and resilience in the echoing emptiness, wasn't interested in ghosts or graveyards.  She was interested in the raw, untamed energy still coursing through the decaying infrastructure, a silent testament to the factory's glory days.  Tonight, her mission was to assess the damage, a cryptic call from a local antique shop owner, who claimed a "strange current" had begun to pulse through a recently acquired machine housed in the back of his shop.  The shop owner was a nervous man, whose fear was amplified by the stories whispered about the factory, but Amelia, in her quiet way, had her own suspicions.  The whispers, she knew, often concealed more than they revealed.
