The fluorescent lights of the Sterling & Stone accounting firm hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the rhythmic clatter of Amelia Peabody’s fingers on the keyboard.  Amelia, a secretary of impeccable efficiency, meticulously updated client files, her movements as precise as a finely tuned machine.  Today, however, the familiar rhythm was off-key.  A persistent buzzing, like trapped bees in a jar, echoed from the antiquated fax machine in the corner.  It wasn't the machine's fault.  It was the content.

Setting: The Sterling & Stone accounting firm, a nondescript office building on a grey, blustery corner of Main Street in the perpetually overcast town of Oakhaven.  The air inside the office was thick with the smell of stale coffee and the faint, almost imperceptible, aroma of old paper.  Sunlight struggled to pierce the grime-coated windows, casting long shadows across the rows of cubicles.  Amelia's workstation, a worn beige cubicle, was situated near the back, a small island of organized chaos amidst the broader expanse of paperwork and overflowing in-trays.  A framed photograph of a beaming family – the presumed owners of the firm – sat on her desk, a stark contrast to the quiet tension that hung in the air.
