Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the precinct, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Detective Isabella "Izzy" Diaz.  The flickering fluorescent lights cast long, unnerving shadows across the sterile beige walls, highlighting the scattered files and half-eaten takeout containers that littered her small desk.  The air hung thick with the smell of stale coffee and desperation.  It was 3 AM, and the city, usually a restless beast, slumbered beneath a suffocating blanket of grey.  Izzy, a seasoned Detective in the 22nd Precinct of Chicago's South Side, stared at a single, crumpled photograph.  It showed a young woman, smiling brightly, holding a bouquet of sunflowers. The woman was a missing person, but her smile felt like a cruel mockery against the backdrop of the city's relentless darkness.  This case, unlike the others, felt different. This case felt personal.
