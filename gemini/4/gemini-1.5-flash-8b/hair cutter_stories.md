The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual beige from decades of spilled bleach and the residue of countless hair dyes, reflected Amelia Hawthorne's worried face.  Sunlight, weak and filtered through the grime-coated windowpanes of "Scissors & Secrets," cast long shadows across the cluttered salon.

Amelia, a woman etched with the quiet desperation of someone perpetually trying to hold back the tide, traced the faded outline of a clientâ€™s name on a dog-eared appointment book.  It was Tuesday, a slow day, and the only sound besides the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner was the faint hum of the buzzing clippers.  This week felt like a particularly bleak, thinning landscape, each passing hour adding another layer of apprehension to the hollow feeling in her stomach.  The silence was punctuated by the insistent drip, drip, drip of the leaky faucet.  Her small salon was tucked away on a side street, its faded burgundy paint a testament to its years, and often held more secrets than the whispered stories of its clients.
