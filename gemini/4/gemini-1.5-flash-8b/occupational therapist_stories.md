Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the abandoned warehouse, a relentless drumming that mirrored the frantic rhythm in Elara Nightingale’s chest.  The air, thick with the smell of mildew and forgotten things, clung to her like a second skin.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of weak sunlight slicing through the gloom, illuminating a labyrinth of rusting machinery and broken pallets. This, Elara realised with a sigh, was not the kind of office space the brochures promised.  This was Therapy Haven, or, more accurately, Therapy *Haven’t-Quite-Got-It-Together-Yet*.

Elara Nightingale, occupational therapist extraordinaire – though "extraordinaire" felt a bit grandiose when staring at the dilapidated filing cabinet – had just received a referral for a young man named Leo. Leo’s case file, a flimsy document crammed with medical jargon, hinted at a complex interplay of trauma and neglect. The case file was almost a joke in itself, a paper-thin record in a building that seemed to swallow whole the memories of past occupants.  He was her latest challenge, and frankly, her latest test of resilience.  How could anyone practice occupational therapy in an environment that seemed determined to undo whatever progress was made?  The crumbling structure seemed to echo her own doubts.  This abandoned warehouse was both the perfect place to try and heal a broken spirit and a monument to the fractured state of the world itself.
