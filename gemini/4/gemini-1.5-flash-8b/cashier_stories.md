The fluorescent lights of the "Corner Mart" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Butterfield's carefully constructed routine.  Three o'clock on a Tuesday meant the usual flurry of afternoon shoppers: the harried mother grabbing last-minute snacks for her kids, the elderly gentleman meticulously counting out his change, the teenager awkwardly navigating a complicated transaction on his phone.  Amelia, with her neatly braided brown hair and perpetually tired eyes, processed it all with a practiced efficiency.  The air, thick with the smell of stale coffee and slightly sweet bakery goods, clung to her, a familiar blanket of mundane tasks.  Outside, the rhythmic chirp of cicadas and the occasional rumble of distant traffic were the only other sounds that broke the sterile quiet of the small, suburban store.  This particular Tuesday, though, felt different.  A different kind of hum, a low, almost imperceptible thrum, seemed to vibrate beneath the surface of the store's mundane normalcy.
