The humid air hung thick and heavy, a suffocating blanket draped over the bustling terminal.  Rain hammered against the corrugated metal roof, mimicking the frantic rhythm of Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's heart.  Amy, a flight attendant for the sprawling, multinational airline, Aerolineas del Sol, stared out at the churning grey sky, a nervous tremor in her hand as she clutched her worn leather travel journal.  She was supposed to be boarding the 10:30 flight to Santiago, a routine trip for a seasoned professional.  But tonight, something felt... off.  Not just the unusually violent storm, but a premonition of impending trouble, a cold dread that clung to her like the damp air.

The terminal, a concrete jungle teeming with anxious travelers, was a kaleidoscope of hurried footsteps, the clipped tones of announcements, and the melodic cries of street vendors.  Brightly coloured posters advertising exotic destinations clashed with the subdued gloom of the weather.  In the corner, a lone figure hunched over a newspaper, completely oblivious to the tension crackling in the air.  The faint scent of jasmine, usually a comforting presence, tonight seemed to amplify the oppressive weight of the moment.  Amy knew instinctively that something about this specific atmosphere, this particular moment, was different and deeply unsettling.
