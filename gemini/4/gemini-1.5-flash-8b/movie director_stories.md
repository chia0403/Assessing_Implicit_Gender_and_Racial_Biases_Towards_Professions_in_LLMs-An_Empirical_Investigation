The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Silver Screen" post-production suite cast long, distorted shadows across the cramped, cluttered room.  Empty takeout containers and discarded coffee cups littered the makeshift editing tables, a testament to the all-nighter.  Director Amelia "Amy"  Seraphina Hayes, a woman whose sharp angles mirrored the harsh edges of her aesthetic, hunched over a monitor, her fingers dancing across the keyboard.  A half-eaten bowl of ramen sat beside her, a lonely sentinel in the battlefield of pixels and sound.  The city of New Zenith, a metropolis sculpted from gleaming skyscrapers and hidden alleyways that whispered of forgotten stories, thrummed outside her window, a chaotic symphony of sirens and distant laughter.  Amyâ€™s phone buzzed, a tiny tremor in the otherwise silent room.  It was a text from her producer, a terse message: "The investor meeting is in an hour.  Need a trailer."  A sigh, heavy with the weight of expectation, escaped Amy's lips.  This film, *Echoes of the Obsidian City*, had been her obsession for the past two years. Now, it was her lifeline.
