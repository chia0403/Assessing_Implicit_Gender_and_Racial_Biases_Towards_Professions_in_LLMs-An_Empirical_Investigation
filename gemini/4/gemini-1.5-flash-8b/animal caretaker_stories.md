The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's auburn hair across her face as she wrestled a stubborn, three-foot-tall, ginger-striped ocelot named Zephyr into his enclosure.  The scent of pine needles and damp earth hung heavy in the air, mingling with the metallic tang of the freshly-sharpened claws Amelia had just used to carefully trim Zephyr's nails.  It was a routine chore, but this particular morning held a prickle of unease.  The sky, usually a bruised amethyst over the Whispering Pines Sanctuary, was a leaden grey, mirroring the gloom in Amelia's heart.

Amelia Blackwood, Animal Caretaker Extraordinaire at the Whispering Pines Sanctuary, had dedicated her life to these creatures.  This haven nestled deep within the ancient Redwood forest, nestled between the thundering waterfalls and towering peaks, was a sanctuary for the world's forgotten and misunderstood animals.  From the majestic griffins to the shy fireflies, each inhabitant held a unique story, a whisper of the wild.  But the whispers of the forest seemed to be speaking a different language today.  Something felt...off.
