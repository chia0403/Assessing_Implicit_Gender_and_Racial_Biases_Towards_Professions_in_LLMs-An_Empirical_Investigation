The fluorescent lights of the emergency room hummed, a monotonous counterpoint to the frantic beeping of heart monitors and the ragged breaths of the patients.  Rain hammered against the windows of the sprawling hospital, mirroring the relentless storm brewing inside Dr. Amelia Hayes, Emergency Medical Technician.  Tonight was a particularly brutal one.  The city, usually a symphony of streetlights and late-night chatter, was a muted grey canvas under the relentless downpour.  The air, thick with the smell of antiseptic and fear, hung heavy in the sterile hallways.  Amelia, a seasoned EMT with a lifetime of experience in the face of sudden, life-altering trauma, found herself increasingly unnerved.  Not by the patients themselves, but by the pervasive, unsettling silence that seemed to hang between the harrowing cries and hushed whispers of the staff.  It was a silence that spoke volumes, a silence that hinted at something more profound, something darker.
