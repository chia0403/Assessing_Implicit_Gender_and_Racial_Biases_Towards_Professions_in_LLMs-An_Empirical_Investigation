The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Speaker," a greasy spoon diner that smelled faintly of burnt coffee and desperation, cast a lurid glow on the rain-slicked street outside.  Inside, amidst the clatter of dishes and the low hum of conversation, Amelia  "Flicker"  Fitzwilliam, radio technician extraordinaire, hunched over a workbench groaning under the weight of salvaged parts.  Copper wires, tangled like unruly snakes, snaked across the space, intertwining with rows of vintage capacitors and faded circuit boards.  The air, thick with the scent of solder and ozone, buzzed with a low, almost imperceptible static.  Flicker, her name a testament to the constant electric hum in her life, wrestled with a particularly stubborn antenna.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  Her latest project, a long-range radio transmitter intended to bridge the communications gap between the isolated coastal town of Seabrook and the outside world, seemed as intractable as the weather outside.
