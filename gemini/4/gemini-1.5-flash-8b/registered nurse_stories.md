The sterile white of the hospital corridor felt suffocating, a stark contrast to the humid, green chaos of the jungle outside Dr. Amelia Blackwood's window.  Amelia, a registered nurse with a sharp, observant gaze and hands that moved with practiced precision, surveyed the patient charts spread across her polished mahogany desk.  Each file was a miniature universe, a tapestry woven with threads of suffering and resilience.  The rhythmic beeping of machines, a constant hum in the background, was the only sound that truly broke the silence, a metronome counting down the moments, the lives, held in the balance.  This particular Tuesday was more intense than most.  A double-shift on the surgical floor, coupled with a persistent, bone-deep exhaustion that had begun weeks earlier, had begun to knot in her gut like a tightening tourniquet.  Outside, the lush, vibrant greenery of the rainforest canopy, only a thin veil separating them from the hospital's window, seemed impossibly far from the sterile, clinical reality of her workplace.  Rain hammered against the glass, a relentless counterpoint to the soft whir of the ventilation system, and Amelia, sighing, pressed her temple.
