The flickering gaslight cast long, skeletal shadows across the polished parquet floor of Blackwood Manor.  Dust motes danced in the single beam of light slicing through the gloom of the hallway, illuminated by a lone, sputtering gas lamp.  Agnes Periwinkle, housekeeper at Blackwood Manor for the past twenty-seven years, adjusted the frayed collar of her starched uniform, a deep crimson that was now more faded burgundy.  The scent of old books and something faintly floral, perhaps lilies, hung heavy in the air, mingling with the musty aroma of aged wood and forgotten secrets.  A chill, deeper than the autumn air, seemed to seep into her bones, a constant companion in the vast, echoing halls of this grand, yet somehow desolate, estate.  Each creak of the ancient timbers, each rustle of unseen drapery, sent a tremor of unease through her. Tonight, the unease felt different, sharper, like a blade poised to slice through the carefully constructed silence she had come to expect.
