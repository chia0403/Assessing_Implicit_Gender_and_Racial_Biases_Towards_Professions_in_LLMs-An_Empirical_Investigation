The wind, a razor-sharp blade, whipped across the exposed peaks of the Carpathian Mountains, stinging Elias Thorne's cheeks as he hammered the chisel.  Stone dust, fine as flour, filled the air, swirling around him like a ghostly mist.  He was alone, high above the valley, nestled in a crevice carved by centuries of glacial runoff.  The only sound besides the wind and the rhythmic clang of his tools was the distant, mournful cry of a raven, echoing across the desolate landscape.  Elias, a stone cutter of formidable reputation in the shadowed villages below, was carving a figure of improbable size and unsettling beauty.  A phoenix, perhaps, though the creature's form, still emerging from the rough-hewn stone, held an almost malevolent aura.  He was sculpting not just a bird, but a monument to something – or someone – unseen, something ancient and vast and lurking just beyond the veil of the mountain peaks.  The village of Silvanwood, nestled in the valley below, seemed a million miles away, swallowed by the inky twilight.  The task was his; the inspiration, a whisper in the wind, a shadow in the stone.
