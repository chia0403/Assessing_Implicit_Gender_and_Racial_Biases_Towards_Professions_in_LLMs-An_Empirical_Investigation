The flickering neon sign of the "Byte-Sized Bistro" cast a sickly green glow on Elias Thorne's face, reflecting in the myriad of tiny LEDs embedded in the chipped laminate of his worn-out laptop.

Another all-nighter, another seemingly intractable bug in the new operating system he was developing for the "Quantum Leap" virtual reality platform.  His apartment, a cramped two-bedroom in a gritty section of the city known as Glitch-Town, smelled faintly of burnt coffee and desperation.  Empty pizza boxes, crumpled napkins, and discarded circuit boards littered the cluttered space.  A single, dusty lamp illuminated his workspace, a chaotic montage of wires, cables, and half-eaten takeout containers. The rhythmic hum of the city's underbelly, a symphony of car horns, sirens, and the incessant whirring of server farms, was a constant backdrop to Elias's solitary struggle.  Outside, the rain hammered against the grimy windowpanes, mirroring the tempest brewing inside his head.
