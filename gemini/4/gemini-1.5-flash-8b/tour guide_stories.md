The biting wind whipped Amelia "Anya" Petrova's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks like a thousand tiny needles.  Below, the cobblestone streets of Prague shimmered under a bruised twilight sky, the Charles Bridge, a shimmering ribbon of stone and light, arched majestically across the Vltava River.  Anya, her breath puffing white in the frigid air, adjusted her backpack, the weight of her responsibilities settling on her shoulders. Tonight was the Night of the Legends tour, and, as always, the pressure to deliver a captivating narrative – to weave the centuries of lore into a spellbinding present – felt heavy.  Each whisper of the wind, each groan of the ancient buildings, seemed to echo her own anxieties.  She was a ghost-hunter, a storyteller, a custodian of history, and tonight, the fate of her reputation, and perhaps even a few broken hearts, hung precariously in the balance.  The first group of tourists, a gaggle of wide-eyed college students from the USA, were already waiting, their excited chatter a comforting counterpoint to the encroaching silence.

**Setting:** Prague, Czech Republic, a crisp winter evening. The Charles Bridge, illuminated by the soft glow of streetlights and a few strategically placed lanterns, is the backdrop for the scene, as the surrounding city, with its historic architecture, exudes a palpable sense of mystery and antiquity.
