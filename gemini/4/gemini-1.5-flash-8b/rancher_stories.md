The wind, a relentless, whispering beast, whipped across the parched plains of the Chihuahuan Desert, tugging at the faded denim of Silas Blackwood, 32.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of ochre and despair, danced across the vast expanse of the Jornada del Muerto, a name that echoed the landscape's unforgiving spirit.  Silas, weathered and lean, watched them from the porch of his ramshackle adobe ranch house, 'The Last Stand.'  Its walls, once vibrant ochre, were now a muted shade, worn and scarred by the unrelenting sun and countless dust storms.  A lone, skeletal mesquite tree, its branches twisted like gnarled fingers, stood sentinel in the yard, its silhouette barely visible against the fiery sunset.  The air, thick with the scent of sagebrush and impending twilight, held the promise of a long, lonely night.  Silas knew that every night in this desolate land held its own silent secrets.
