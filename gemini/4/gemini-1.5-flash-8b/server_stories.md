The flickering neon sign of the Rusty Mug cast a sickly yellow glow on Amelia "Amy" Blackwood's face, highlighting the dark circles under her eyes.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, mimicking the frantic rhythm of her heart.  Inside, the smoky air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and desperation.  The Rusty Mug, a dive bar tucked away on a forgotten corner of Willow Creek, was Amy's universe, her cage, and her only means of survival.  Willow Creek itself was a town steeped in history, or perhaps just a sense of perpetual, quiet decay.  The old Victorian houses lining the main street, once grand and elegant, now stared out with vacant windows, like hollowed eyes watching the passing years.  Rusty Mug sat at the end of Elm Street, just before the rusty, dilapidated bridge that crossed over the murky, perpetually-fog-shrouded creek.  The bridge, known locally as "The Whispering Bridge," had long been rumored to be haunted, but that was just another story that whispered on the wind in the sleepy town.
