The flickering neon sign of "Bubbly Bob's Plumbing" cast a sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked alley.  Water, in a persistent, irritating drip, dripped from the rusted gutter, a symphony of unwelcome sound against the otherwise silent night.  Inside the cramped workshop,  Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, a burly plumber with grease smudged across his perpetually rumpled shirt, swore under his breath.  He traced the faint, almost invisible hairline crack in the porcelain sink, his calloused fingers working a silent prayer.  The customer, a frantic Mrs. Higgins, had been insistent, demanding a miraculous fix for a leaky faucet that had plagued her for decades.  Barty, renowned (or perhaps notorious) for his stubborn determination, had promised her the world, now he faced a seemingly insurmountable challenge.  The alley itself was a microcosm of the city's forgotten corners; a tangle of forgotten pipes, overflowing bins, and shadowed alleyways, each crevice a potential source of plumbing woes.  Barty, immersed in the task, could practically hear the city breathing around him, a city that pulsed with both life and potential catastrophe.  The faintest whisper of distant sirens faded into the background noise, a reminder that even in the quietest alleys, problems were rarely far away.
