The fluorescent lights of Miss Eleanor Ainsworth's third-grade classroom hummed, a monotonous drone punctuated only by the rhythmic scrawls of crayons across paper.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun, filtering through the grimy windowpanes of the dilapidated school building,  casting long, distorted shadows that stretched across the worn linoleum floor.  Autumn leaves, a kaleidoscope of reds and golds, crunched softly underfoot as Miss Ainsworth navigated the maze of desks, her worn brown cardigan a familiar sight amidst the chaos of budding imaginations.  Today, however, the air hung thick with a peculiar stillness, a premonition of something momentous—something that felt eerily, almost unnaturally, quiet.  The usual clamor of excited chatter, the jangle of lunch trays, the enthusiastic recitations of multiplication tables—all were absent, replaced by an unnerving silence.  Miss Ainsworth, a woman of 35 years with eyes the color of polished amber, felt a prickle of unease crawl up her spine.  She knew instinctively that this quiet was not the quiet of a peaceful afternoon; it was the quiet before a storm.
