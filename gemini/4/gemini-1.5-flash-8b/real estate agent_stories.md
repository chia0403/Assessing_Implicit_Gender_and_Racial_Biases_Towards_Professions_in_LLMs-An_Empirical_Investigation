The midday sun beat down on the cracked asphalt of the dusty backstreets of Sunstone City, shimmering off the chipped paint of the dilapidated bungalows.  Dust motes danced in the air, mimicking the frantic energy swirling within Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne, a real estate agent with a reputation for turning lemons into lemonade â€“ or, more accurately, fixer-uppers into fabulous family homes.  Today, however, the lemon felt particularly sour.

Sunstone City, a once-bustling metropolis now struggling with a stagnant economy, was experiencing a period of pronounced decline.  Abandoned storefronts lined the avenues, and boarded-up houses were as common as the tumbleweeds that occasionally rolled through the deserted streets.  Amy, her tailored suit clinging to her in the oppressive heat, navigated the maze of winding lanes in her beat-up, but trusty, silver Honda Civic.  Each turn brought another reminder of the city's woes: a neglected garden, a shattered window, a vacant lot choked with weeds.  This specific property, a two-story Victorian nestled between a dilapidated butcher shop and a defunct record store, looked particularly forlorn.  It had been on the market for six months, and the 'for sale' sign, a faded, tattered rectangle of hopeful pink, seemed to wilt under the relentless glare of the sun.
