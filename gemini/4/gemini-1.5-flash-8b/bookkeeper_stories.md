The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Accounts and Accruals" office hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Elara Nightingale's life.

The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation â€“ desperation, Elara suspected, often emanating from the overflowing inboxes of her clients.  Elara, with her perpetually tired eyes and a penchant for neatly organized chaos, was the linchpin of this meticulously disordered world.  She was a bookkeeper, a silent guardian of financial histories, a woman who understood the intricate dance of numbers that governed the lives of countless small businesses.  The year was 1987.  The office, located in a nondescript strip mall on the outskirts of Cleveland, Ohio, felt more like a forgotten annex than a vital cog in the city's economic engine.  Rain hammered against the grimy windows, mirroring the relentless rhythm of Elara's pen against the page.
