The flickering neon sign of the "Sunrise Diner" cast a sickly yellow glow on Amelia Hawthorne's face, highlighting the dark circles beneath her eyes.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic rhythm of her thoughts.

Amelia, a freelance investigative reporter for the Zenith Gazette, hunched over a half-eaten burger, the grease staining her worn trench coat.  The diner, usually buzzing with the low rumble of conversations and the clatter of cutlery, was eerily quiet tonight.  Only the rhythmic drip, drip, drip of the leaky faucet in the back room broke the silence, a soundtrack to the growing unease in her stomach.  Tonight, Amelia had a story to chase, a story buried beneath the rust and grime of Zenith, and it was a story that smelled of something rotten.
