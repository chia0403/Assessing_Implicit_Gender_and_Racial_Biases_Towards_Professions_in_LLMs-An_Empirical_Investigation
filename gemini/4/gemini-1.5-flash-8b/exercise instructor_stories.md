Sweat beaded on her brow, a glistening mirror reflecting the harsh fluorescent lights of the "Ironclad Fitness" gym.  Amelia, a seasoned exercise instructor with a surprisingly calm demeanor despite the relentless energy she channeled into her classes, adjusted the weight on the leg press machine, a low groan echoing through the cavernous space.
