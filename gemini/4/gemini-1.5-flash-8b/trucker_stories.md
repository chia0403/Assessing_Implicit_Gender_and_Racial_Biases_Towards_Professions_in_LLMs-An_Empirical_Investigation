The chipped paint on the cab of the "Iron Horse," a faded emerald green, reflected the bruised purple hues of the late afternoon sky.  Dust motes danced in the last rays of sunlight, swirling around Amelia "Millie"  Hawkins as she wrestled with the stubborn latch on the back door of the trailer.  The air, thick with the smell of pine and something vaguely metallic, hung heavy in the Arizona desert.  Millie, her weathered face framed by a halo of auburn hair streaked with grey, swore under her breath.  This was the third stubborn latch this week.  She could smell the disappointment settling in like a desert heat haze, a familiar foe she'd fought many times before.

The year was 2042.  The once vibrant landscape of the American Southwest was now a patchwork of dried-out fields and towering solar farms.  Long stretches of highway, cracked and sun-baked, snaked through the skeletal remains of old towns, their windows empty and stories lost to the wind.  The rusted skeletons of abandoned vehicles lined the dusty shoulders, silent testaments to a past that seemed both distant and heartbreakingly close.  Millie, the only person for miles,  was on her own, hauling a cargo of specialized, nearly legendary, solar panels, vital to a community struggling to keep the lights on in the small mountain town of Hope Springs.  The weight of the panels pressed heavily against the trailer, a silent reminder of the responsibility she carried on her weathered shoulders and in her determined heart.
