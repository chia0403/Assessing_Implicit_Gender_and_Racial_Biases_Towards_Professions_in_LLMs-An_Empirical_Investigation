The greasy haze hung thick in the air of "Rusty Wrench," a garage more accustomed to the smell of burnt oil than perfume.  Sunlight, fractured and distorted by the grime-coated windows, barely penetrated the gloom.  This was the domain of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, a man whose hands, calloused and stained a perpetual shade of dark-brown, had wrestled with engines since he was a boy, transforming their metal groans into rhythmic purrs.  Barty, a lanky man with a perpetually rumpled shirt and a mischievous glint in his eye, was hunched over a sputtering, turquoise-coloured sports car, its engine a cacophony of coughs and sputters.  Outside, the midday sun beat down on the dusty, sun-baked streets of Willow Creek, a town clinging to the side of a mountain range, its faded buildings whispering tales of generations past.  The town's inhabitants, a mix of eccentric artists, farmers, and weathered travelers, all seemed to know Barty, and for better or worse, trusted him with their mechanical woes.
