The crisp autumn air, scented with fallen leaves and woodsmoke, bit at Amelia Blackwood’s cheeks as she pulled her wool scarf tighter around her neck.  The sun, a bruised plum colour, cast long shadows across the cobbled streets of Oakhaven, a village nestled deep within the Derbyshire Peak District.  Twisted, ancient trees, their branches gnarled and laced with spiderwebs, framed the half-timbered houses, each with its own story etched into the weathered wood.  Amelia, a registered dietician with a practiced eye for nutritional imbalances, felt a familiar pang of melancholy as she approached the old apothecary shop, its sign weathered and faded.  This was a place steeped in tradition, a place where whispered remedies and ancient wisdom intertwined with the modern pursuit of health. This was where she worked, and where she knew she would find the ingredients for today’s challenge.
