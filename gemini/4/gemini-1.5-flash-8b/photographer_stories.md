The biting wind whipped Amelia Stone's camera bag around her legs, threatening to tear the seams.  Dust devils, the colour of burnt umber, danced across the cracked earth of the Painted Desert.  The sun, a molten disc in the bruised sky, beat down on her, turning the already parched land into a shimmering mirage.  Amelia, a photographer renowned for her evocative images of forgotten landscapes, squinted, adjusting her worn leather Leica.  This was the Grand Canyon's forgotten cousin, a place few tourists ventured, a place where time seemed to have stalled, and stories whispered on the wind.  The year was 1936.
