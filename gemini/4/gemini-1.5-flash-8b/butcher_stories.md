The flickering gaslight cast long, skeletal shadows across the butcher shop, highlighting the glistening rows of meat hanging from hooks like macabre trophies.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of pale light piercing the gloom, illuminating the chipped porcelain sink where Bartholomew "Barty" Grimshaw, the proprietor of "Grimshaw's Grime & Glory," meticulously scrubbed a blood-stained cleaver.  The air, thick with the aroma of aged beef and something vaguely metallic – perhaps old iron or desperation – hung heavy in the small, cramped space.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful dirge through the skeletal branches of the ancient oak trees that lined the cobbled alleyway, a stark counterpoint to the rhythmic *clink* of Barty's steel against steel.  The year was 1888, and the fog hung low over the grimy, burgeoning industrial city of Grimshaw, a city as unforgiving as the man behind the counter.
