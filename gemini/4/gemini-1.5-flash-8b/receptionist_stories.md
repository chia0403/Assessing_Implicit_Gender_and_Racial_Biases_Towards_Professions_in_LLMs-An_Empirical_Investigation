The fluorescent lights of the Sterling & Stone law firm hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *tap-tap-tap* of Amelia Blackwoodâ€™s fingers on the keyboard.  Amelia, a petite woman with hair the colour of spun moonlight and eyes the shade of a stormy sea, meticulously organised the overflowing inbox, each email a tiny, digital pebble needing to be carefully placed in its designated slot.  The air in the reception area, usually thick with the hushed whispers of legal jargon and the occasional stifled cough, felt strangely still this morning.  A single, impossibly large potted fern, its leaves unnaturally vibrant in the harsh light, stood sentinel beside her desk.  Outside, the grey London sky, perpetually draped over the city like a damp sheet, seemed to press against the windows, mirroring the weight Amelia felt in her chest.  Today, the case of "Smith v. Sterling & Stone" felt heavier than ever, and Amelia was the first line of defence.
