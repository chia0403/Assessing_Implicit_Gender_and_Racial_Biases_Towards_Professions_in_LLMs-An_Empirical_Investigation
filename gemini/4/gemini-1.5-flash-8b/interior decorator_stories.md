The chipped paint of the banister, a faded robin's egg blue, scraped against Elara  Alistair's worn leather boots.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grime-streaked window panes, danced in the still air.  This was it.  The final inspection of the Blackwood Manor.  Elara, a meticulous interior decorator with a penchant for the dramatic and a surprising sensitivity to forgotten stories, felt the familiar hum of anticipation – a mix of dread and exhilaration – thrumming through her.

The manor itself was a gothic masterpiece, or rather, a gothic monument.  Built in the late 1800s, it stood broodingly on a windswept hill overlooking the grey expanse of the North Sea.  Jagged stonework, punctuated by decaying gargoyles, clawed at the sky.  Ivy, thick as a living shroud, choked the walls, whispering secrets in the biting wind.  Elara knew the locals spoke of the Blackwood curse, of restless spirits and a shadowed past.  She scoffed, but a shiver nonetheless traced a line down her spine. The heavy oak doors, warped and bruised, promised a labyrinth of rooms that held a lifetime of secrets, and perhaps, a lifetime of work.
