The biting wind whipped Amelia Silverwood's crimson scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks like shards of ice.  Grey, slate-coloured clouds, thick and oppressive, hung low over the cobbled streets of Montmartre, obscuring the already dim light.  Dust motes danced in the pale, filtered sunlight that struggled to pierce the gloom, clinging to the chipped paint of the ancient buildings that lined the Rue des Trois Fr√®res.  Amelia, her breath fogging in the frigid air, clutched a worn sketchbook under her arm, its pages filled with charcoal sketches of the neighbourhood's weathered faces and melancholic doorways.  She was a painter, a charcoal sculptor, a chronicler of the hidden stories whispered by the stones of Paris.  Today, however, her artistic muse seemed as dormant as the winter-bound vines clinging to the balconies.  An unsettling silence hung in the air, broken only by the distant clang of a tram and the rhythmic drip, drip, drip of a leaky gutter.
