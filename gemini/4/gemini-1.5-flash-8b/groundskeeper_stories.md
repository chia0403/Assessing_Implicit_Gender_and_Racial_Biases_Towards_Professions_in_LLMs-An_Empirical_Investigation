The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's threadbare jacket around her as she surveyed the sprawling estate of Blackwood Manor.  Dust devils danced across the manicured lawns, swirling fallen leaves into miniature tornadoes.  October had arrived with a vengeance, painting the ancient oaks in fiery hues of crimson and gold.  Amelia, groundskeeper for Blackwood Manor for the past twenty years, felt a familiar pang of melancholia.  The grand house, a monument to generations of Blackwood wealth and power, seemed to sigh with a silent, brooding loneliness, a feeling mirrored in the vast, empty spaces she now had to maintain.  The estate, once vibrant with the laughter of children and the murmur of polite conversation, now echoed only with the rustling of leaves and the mournful cries of unseen birds.  Her hands, roughened and calloused from years of tending the meticulously kept gardens, were strangely cold despite the brisk air.  This year, the silence felt heavier than ever.
