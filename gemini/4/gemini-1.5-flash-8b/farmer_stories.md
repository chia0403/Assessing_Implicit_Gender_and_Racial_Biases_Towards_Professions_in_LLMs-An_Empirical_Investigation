The biting wind, a relentless whisper of frost, clawed at Elara Blackwood's exposed cheeks as she surveyed her sprawling, frost-bitten fields.  Dawn, a pale, hesitant blush in the eastern sky, cast long, skeletal shadows across the cracked earth of the Blackwood Estate.  For generations, the estate had been a testament to the Blackwood family's resilience, a patchwork of fertile valleys and windswept hillsides nestled in the heart of the Whisperwind Mountains. But this winter, even the mountains seemed to hold their breath, their peaks shrouded in a thick, suffocating blanket of snow.  Elara, a woman hardened by years of toil and weathered by the unforgiving landscape, felt the familiar ache in her bones, a symphony of cold and weariness.  Her name, Elara Blackwood, carried the weight of responsibility, a legacy etched into the very soil beneath her feet.  The fate of the estate, and the livelihoods of her small community, rested on her shoulders, more so this year than ever before.
