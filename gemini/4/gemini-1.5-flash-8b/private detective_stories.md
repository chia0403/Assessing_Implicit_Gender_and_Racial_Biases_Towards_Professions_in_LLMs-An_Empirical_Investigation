Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the "Rusty Mug," a dive bar nestled in the shadow of the decaying, brick-walled warehouses that lined the docks.  The air hung thick with the smell of stale beer and something vaguely metallic, a scent that clung to Amelia "Ace"  Kingston like a second skin.  Ace, a private investigator with eyes the color of storm clouds and a reputation as sharp as a rusty nail, nursed a bitter whiskey, her gaze fixed on the flickering neon sign outside.  The rain-slicked streets, mirroring the turmoil in her gut, reflected the lurid glow of the sign: "The Crimson Quill."

It was a notorious speakeasy, rumored to be the meeting place for the city’s most dangerous figures – smugglers, gangsters, and gamblers.  Tonight, a new case had landed in her lap.  A case that smelled of betrayal, violence, and a missing manuscript. The missing piece of a novel, they said, one that held the key to a massive, illicit fortune.  She’d heard the whispers – a shadowy figure named "The Serpent," a master manipulator who controlled the city's underbelly, and his obsession with the manuscript.  Now, she was the one tasked with finding it.  Ace had learned to navigate the dark corners of the city, but this one felt… different. A chill snaked down her spine, not from the rain, but from a premonition of danger lurking just beneath the city’s surface.
