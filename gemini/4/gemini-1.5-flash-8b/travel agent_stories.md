The chipped Formica counter, stained with countless forgotten coffees and the ghosts of hastily scribbled itineraries, reflected Amelia Butterfield's weary face.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grime-coated window of "Wanderlust & Whimsy," her tiny travel agency tucked away on a cobbled side street in the perpetually overcast city of Ashwood.  Rain hammered against the windowpanes, a relentless percussion that mirrored the rhythmic thump of Amelia’s own heart – a relentless drumbeat of deadlines and disappointed clients.  Ashwood, a city steeped in history but lacking in vibrancy, felt particularly grey today.  The scent of damp earth and dampened hopes hung heavy in the air.

A seemingly perfect getaway, but Amelia had a sinking feeling this particular client, a reclusive art collector named Mr. Silas Blackwood, held a hidden agenda.  He wanted the island’s alleged forgotten treasures, not its breathtaking sunsets.
