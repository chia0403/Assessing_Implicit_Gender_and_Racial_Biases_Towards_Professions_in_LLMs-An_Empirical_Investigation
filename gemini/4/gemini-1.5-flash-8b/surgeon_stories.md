The sterile white of the operating room hummed, a low, insistent thrum that vibrated through Dr. Isabella "Izzy" Ramirez's bones.  Surgical lights, the color of unforgiving judgment, illuminated the intricate dance of her hands as she meticulously stitched a delicate tendon.  The rhythmic beeping of the heart monitor was the only other sound, a steady counterpoint to the rhythmic rasp of her breathing.  The air, thick with the antiseptic smell of iodine and surgical spirits, tasted metallic and sharp. Outside, the city of New Verona, a sprawling metropolis clinging to the slopes of the volcanic caldera, thrummed with a chaotic energy she couldn't quite feel inside the sterile confines of the room.  Izzy, however, was acutely aware of the weight of responsibility pressing down on her shouldersâ€”a responsibility she carried with a practiced quietude, but a quietude that sometimes felt strained.  Today's patient was a young woman, barely out of her teens, with an injury that spoke volumes of the city's dangerous underbelly. The precise movements of the surgery seemed to mock the fractured reality of the world outside, a world she knew intimately.
