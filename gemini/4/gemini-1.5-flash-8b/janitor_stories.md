The flickering fluorescent lights of the Grand Zenith Library cast long, skeletal shadows across Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's worn, grey mop bucket.  Dust motes, illuminated like tiny, spectral fireflies, danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun piercing the grime-coated windowpanes.  Barty, a janitor of the Grand Zenith Library for the past fifteen years, adjusted the strap of his worn canvas bag, the familiar weight of cleaning supplies a comforting anchor in the silent, towering edifice.  The library, a monument to knowledge, stood on the edge of the sprawling, forgotten city of Aethelgard, its towering bookshelves seemingly swallowing the fading daylight.  Its silence was profound, a stark contrast to the frantic rhythm Barty's life had known before the quiet of the library claimed him.
