The biting wind whipped Amelia “Amy” Sterling’s hair across her face as she adjusted the straps of her worn-but-trusty fleece.  The skeletal branches of the ancient oak trees, stark against the bruised twilight sky, clawed at the pale winter light.  Below, the sprawling campus of Blackwood Manor, a once-grand estate now weathered and faded, stretched out like a forgotten tapestry.  She shivered, not just from the chill but from the sense of foreboding that clung to the place like a shroud.  This was her third visit this week.

Amy, a physical therapist specializing in geriatric rehabilitation, was here to assess the condition of Silas Blackwood, a frail but notoriously stubborn man whose refusal to accept help had put him in a precarious position.  The estate, rumored to be haunted by the restless spirits of its former inhabitants, held a palpable stillness, a silent witness to generations of Blackwood whims and misfortunes.  Inside, the heavy oak doors creaked open, revealing a hallway shrouded in shadows and the faint scent of aged wood and something faintly sweet, like overripe figs. Amy pressed on, the crunching of fallen leaves under her boots echoing in the oppressive quiet.
