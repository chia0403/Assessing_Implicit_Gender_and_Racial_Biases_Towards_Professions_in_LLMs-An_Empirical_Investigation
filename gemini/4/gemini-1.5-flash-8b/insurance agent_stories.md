The flickering neon sign of "Reliable Reinsurance" cast a sickly yellow glow on Amelia "Amy"  Sterling’s rain-slicked raincoat.  The air, thick with the smell of exhaust fumes and impending doom, hung heavy over the back alley.  This wasn't the pristine, sun-drenched office she'd envisioned when she’d landed her dream job, fresh out of university.  This was the underbelly of the city, the forgotten corners where whispers of claims –  and desperation – thrived.  Amy, a sharp-eyed insurance agent with a meticulously organized mind, found herself increasingly uncomfortable in this murky landscape.

The city was a labyrinth of steel and glass, gleaming in the day but cloaked in shadows at night.  Tall, imposing skyscrapers pierced the bruised twilight sky, their lights reflecting in the slick pavement.  Amy, however, was focused on a small, dilapidated building, the kind that seemed to swallow light whole.  It housed the "Ironclad Garage" – a mechanic's shop known less for its polished tools and more for the bizarre, often catastrophic, incidents that took place within its walls.  The very nature of the building seemed to be a testament to the unpredictability of life, a constant reminder that the most meticulously crafted plans could easily crumble under the weight of unforeseen circumstances.  Amy knew, with a sinking feeling in her stomach, that her latest assignment was about to prove that point.
