The chipped porcelain sink, stained a sickly yellow from years of lukewarm water and neglected cleaning, reflected Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's weary face.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grimy window of "The Snip-Snap," a barbershop clinging precariously to life on a side street of Whitestone.  The street itself was a testament to Whitestone's fading grandeur: cracked pavements, overflowing bins, and faded murals depicting long-forgotten heroes. Barty, his dark hair streaked with grey, sighed, running a calloused hand through his thinning locks.  Another Tuesday. Another day of whispered complaints about the rising cost of lentils and the unpredictable whims of the weather.  His worn leather apron, a familiar comfort, draped around his waist like a second skin.  Outside, the rhythmic clang of a passing trolley echoed the relentless tick-tock of the antique grandfather clock in the corner, its pendulum a metronome for the slow, measured pace of life in Whitestone.
