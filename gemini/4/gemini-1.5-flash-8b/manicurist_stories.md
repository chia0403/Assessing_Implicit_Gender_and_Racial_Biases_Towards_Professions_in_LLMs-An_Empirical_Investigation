The chipped paint on the chipped Formica countertop reflected the harsh fluorescent lights of "Nails by Nadia," a tiny salon tucked between a used bookstore and a perpetually-crowded laundromat.  Nadia Petrova, manicurist extraordinaire (at least, that's what she told herself), meticulously filed a client's nail, her movements precise and almost hypnotic.  Outside, the relentless drizzle of a London autumn hammered against the single, grimy window.  The scent of lavender polish, stale coffee, and something vaguely chemical hung heavy in the air, a familiar, comforting (or perhaps just numbingly familiar) aroma of Nadia's tiny kingdom.
