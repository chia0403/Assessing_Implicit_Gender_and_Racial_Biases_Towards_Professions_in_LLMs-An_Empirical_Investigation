The flickering neon sign of the "Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked cobblestones of the alley.  A chill wind whipped through the narrow passage, carrying with it the faint scent of roasted coffee and something vaguely metallic, perhaps from the nearby scrap yard.  Inside, the air was thick with the humid, comforting aroma of stale beer and simmering spices.  This was Amelia Blackwood's stage.  Not the polished, perfectly lit stage of a grand auditorium, but the rough-hewn, intimate space of a backroom dive bar.

Amelia Blackwood, a woman with eyes the colour of storm clouds and a voice like liquid moonlight, adjusted her worn leather jacket, the familiar weight grounding her.  Tonight was "Open Mic Night," the weekly ritual that had become her sanctuary, her canvas, her lifeline.  The worn wooden table, littered with empty pint glasses and half-eaten sandwiches, was her stage; the crowd, a sea of faces etched with weariness and longing, her audience.
