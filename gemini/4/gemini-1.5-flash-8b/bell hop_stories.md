The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the cobblestones of Grosvenor Square, illuminating the opulent facade of the Grand Cavendish Hotel.  Rain, a relentless curtain, hammered against the high windows, mirroring the tempest brewing inside young Bartholomew "Barty" Finch, bell hop extraordinaire (though "extraordinaire" felt a bit grand for a lad whose uniform was often speckled with the remnants of spilled tea).  The year was 1888, and London, in all its glorious, grimy grandeur, held a palpable tension, a feeling Barty couldn't quite place, like a misplaced key echoing through a vast, echoing hall.  His current assignment, a rather fussy and imperious-sounding Lady Ashworth, was adding to the pressure.  She'd requested a particular, and seemingly impossibly rare, type of lavender sachet for her evening tea, a quest that felt as daunting as navigating the maze of corridors that formed the hotel's heart.
