The fluorescent lights of the "Tax Time Express" hummed, a monotonous drone that seemed to vibrate through Amelia Blackwood’s very bones.  Empty takeout containers, remnants of countless late nights, littered the countertop, a testament to the relentless march of April 15th.  The air, thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, hung heavy in the small, cramped office.  Amelia, a woman of thirty-two with perpetually tired eyes and a resilience forged in the crucible of tax season, stared at the blinking cursor on her computer screen.  Another amended return.  Another client’s anxieties echoing in the strained silence of her tiny cubicle.  Her meticulously organized desk, a microcosm of tax forms and receipts, hinted at the meticulous nature that had once been her pride, now overshadowed by the relentless pressure.  Outside, the city of New Haven, Connecticut, bustled with a life that seemed completely oblivious to the relentless paperwork that defined her reality.  It was the penultimate night of the tax filing season, and Amelia knew that even though she was exhausted, one more return meant the difference between a very profitable and a barely passable end to the year.
