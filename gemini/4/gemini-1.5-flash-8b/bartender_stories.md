The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow over the rain-slicked cobblestones of Old Stonetown.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of stale beer, aged wood, and something faintly sweet, like burnt sugar.  Barkeep Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, a man whose face, etched with the lines of countless late nights and whispered secrets, wiped down the bar with a practiced hand.  A single, almost imperceptible tremor ran through his weathered frame, a response not to the chill of the night, but to the low, rhythmic thump-thump-thumping coming from the back room.  Tonight, the thump-thump-thump felt different, more insistent, more...ominous.  The usual ragtag collection of merchants, sailors, and dreamers huddled around their tables, oblivious to the undercurrent of unease,  mostly engrossed in their own quiet dramas. But Barty, who had seen enough of the town's underbelly to last a lifetime, sensed the storm gathering.  He knew the thump-thump-thump was a prelude to something significant, something that was about to spill out from the shadows of the back room and change everything.
