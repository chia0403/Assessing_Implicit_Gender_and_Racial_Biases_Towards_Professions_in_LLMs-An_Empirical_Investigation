The flickering fluorescent lights of Dr. Amelia Hawthorne's office hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the quiet crackle of static electricity in the air.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight piercing the gloom of the small, cluttered room.  Amelia, Dr. Amelia Hawthorne to be precise, hunched over a patient, her brow furrowed in concentration.  The scent of antiseptic mingled with the faint aroma of stale coffee and something vaguely floral â€“ perhaps a forgotten bouquet of lilies.  Her worn leather jacket, a familiar shield against the chill of the city, lay draped over the back of her worn wooden chair.  The waiting room, a space crammed with oversized magazines and chipped plastic toys, was empty. This was the quiet before the storm, before the familiar thrum of her patients' pain turned into a desperate plea for relief.  Amelia's office, tucked away on a side street in the heart of the bustling metropolis of New Zenith, was a sanctuary of sorts, a place where the symphony of the city faded into the subtle melody of bone and muscle.  This particular patient, a young woman named Elara, clutching her shoulder with a grimace, was a new addition to the symphony of pain that was Amelia's daily routine.
