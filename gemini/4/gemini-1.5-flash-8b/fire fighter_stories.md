The acrid tang of smoke, a familiar but nonetheless unwelcome guest, clung to Lieutenant Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's lungs.  Rain, a cold, relentless curtain, plastered the already grimy cityscape to her skin.  The flickering neon sign of the "Golden Gleam" diner, usually a beacon of late-night greasy spoons, now pulsed faintly, a ghostly heartbeat in the suffocating gloom.  Amy hunched deeper into her soaked thermal gear, her breath misting in the freezing air.  The fire, a ferocious blaze consuming the upper floors of the building, raged with a terrifying, rhythmic crackle. The city, normally vibrant and alive, was a symphony of sirens and subdued whispers in the face of the encroaching darkness.
