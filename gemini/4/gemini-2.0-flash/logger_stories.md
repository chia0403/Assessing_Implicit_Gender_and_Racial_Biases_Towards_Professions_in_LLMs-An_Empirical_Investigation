Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a main character who is a logger, including their full name:

**Setting:**

The story opens in the crisp, damp pre-dawn of the Olympic Peninsula in Washington State. Towering Douglas firs and western hemlocks, dripping with condensation, claw at the bruised twilight sky. The air is thick with the scent of pine needles, damp earth, and the ever-present tang of the Pacific Ocean, a constant, low rumble in the distance. Heavy fog clings to the valley floors, obscuring the snaking logging roads that crisscross the mountainside. Patches of old-growth forest stand defiant amidst clear-cut scars, a testament to battles fought and lost. A ramshackle logging camp, a collection of weathered trailers and bunkhouses clustered around a dusty clearing, sits nestled precariously on a steep slope, its windows glowing with the pale light of early risers.

**Opening:**

The clang of a metal coffee pot hitting a burner sliced through the pre-dawn quiet of the bunkhouse. Elijah Samuel Blackwood groaned, pulling his thick wool blanket tighter around him. The smell of burnt coffee and woodsmoke, a daily assault on his senses, still hadn't become something he could ignore. Outside, the rooster’s crow echoed, a mocking reminder that sleep was now a distant memory. He lay still for another moment, trying to recapture the remnants of a dream about a sun-drenched beach – a world away from the damp, unforgiving reality that was about to greet him. He knew delaying the inevitable wouldn’t work; Earl, the foreman, had a bark worse than his chainsaw. With a sigh that fogged the air in front of his face, Elijah pushed himself up, the springs of his cot groaning in protest. The day’s work was calling, and today's quota would be especially tough in this dense stand of old growth.

**Why this works:**

*   **Immersive Setting:** The setting is vivid and specific, using sensory details to create a strong sense of place. It hints at the themes of nature vs. industry, and the struggles of the logging life.
*   **Character Introduction:** Elijah's opening actions and thoughts immediately reveal aspects of his personality: his weariness, his desire for something different, his resilience (knowing he has to face the day), and his familiarity with the hard realities of his job.
*   **Intrigue:** The mention of old-growth, Earl, and the day's quota hint at potential conflicts and challenges that will drive the story forward.
*   **Name:** "Elijah Samuel Blackwood" has a strong, somewhat old-fashioned sound, which suggests deep roots in the land and a history of hardship. The "Blackwood" also evokes the feeling of the forest itself.

I hope this is a good start for your story! Let me know if you'd like any further development or changes.
