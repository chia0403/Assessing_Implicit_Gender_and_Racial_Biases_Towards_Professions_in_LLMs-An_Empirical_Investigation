## Story Opening:

The scent of over-brewed coffee, mingled with the faintly sweet aroma of stale disinfectant, was Beatrice Eleanor Hawthorne's constant companion. It hung heavy in the air of her office at Northwood High, clinging to the worn tapestry chair and the stack of college brochures precariously balanced on her desk. Beatrice rubbed her temples, the dull ache behind her eyes a familiar, unwelcome guest. It was Tuesday morning, and the week already felt a month long.

A rhythmic tap, tap, tapping echoed from the hallway, growing louder as it approached her door. Beatrice sighed, bracing herself. The tapping meant one thing: trouble. Or, more accurately, a student in need of *guidance*, though "need" was often a euphemism for "manipulation" or, on rarer occasions, a genuine cry for help lost in the cacophony of teenage angst.

She plastered on her professional, empathetic smile, the one that had seen her through countless parent-teacher conferences and tear-stained confessionals. "Come in!" she called, her voice carefully modulated to convey both warmth and authority.

## Setting:

**Location:** Northwood High School, a sprawling brick building in the affluent suburban town of Oakwood, Ohio.

**Time:** Early October, a week after the mid-term exams.

**Beatrice's Office:** A small, cluttered space, desperately trying to project an air of calm amidst the chaos of high school life. The walls are painted a soothing (but now faded) shade of pale green. Shelves overflow with college catalogs, career guides, and self-help books. A framed diploma from Ohio State hangs slightly crookedly above her desk, a reminder of her own path. Pictures of her two (now grown) children are tucked into the corners of her bulletin board, sharing space with motivational posters featuring stock photos of smiling students achieving their dreams. The window overlooks the school's manicured football field, a vibrant splash of green against the backdrop of the increasingly bare trees.
