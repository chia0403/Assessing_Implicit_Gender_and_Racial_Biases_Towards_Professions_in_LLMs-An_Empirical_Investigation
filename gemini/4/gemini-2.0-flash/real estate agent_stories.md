Okay, here's a story opening and setting, featuring a real estate agent named Eleanor Vance:

**Story Opening:**

The rain was a relentless percussion against the wrought iron balcony, echoing the gnawing anxiety in Eleanor Vance's stomach. She swirled the tepid, half-finished cup of coffee in her hand, the grounds clinging to the ceramic like grim reminders of forgotten promises. The 'For Sale' sign out front, usually a beacon of opportunity, now felt like a mocking epitaph for her career, maybe even her life. Three months. Three months this property had been sitting, a grand Victorian with a breathtaking view of the Mississippi River, and not a single serious offer. Not even a nibble.

Eleanor blew a stray strand of graying blonde hair from her face and forced herself to take another sip. Maybe, just maybe, the open house tomorrow would be different. Maybe someone would see the potential, the history, the *soul* of this house. Maybe someone would see past the peeling paint, the creaky floors, and the… *unexplained* chill that seemed to permeate the air after dark. She shivered, despite herself. Even Eleanor, a seasoned real estate agent, couldn't shake the feeling that she wasn't alone in the house.

**Setting:**

The story is set in **Natchez, Mississippi**, in the present day (early 2020s). Specifically, Eleanor is standing on the balcony of the aforementioned Victorian mansion located on **Crescent Avenue**, a street known for its antebellum homes and stunning views of the Mississippi River.

The house itself, christened "Magnolia Dreams" by its previous (deceased) owner, is a three-story Queen Anne Victorian, complete with a turret, gingerbread trim, and wrap-around balconies. It’s a grand old house that's fallen on slightly hard times. The interior is filled with antique furniture, some original to the house, that contributes to both its charm and its slightly spooky atmosphere. The garden, once meticulously maintained, is now overgrown with wisteria and azaleas, lending an air of faded grandeur to the property. The air is thick with the humid scent of river water and decaying leaves, a constant reminder of the South's complicated history.
