## Story Opening:

The scent of antiseptic and overripe bananas hung heavy in the air, a familiar, almost comforting aroma to Dr. Evelyn Reed. Outside, the November rain lashed against the panoramic windows of the clinic, blurring the already gray cityscape into an impressionistic painting. Inside, the rhythmic thump of a treadmill punctuated the gentle murmurs of patients and therapists. Evelyn, her blonde hair pulled back in a practical bun, adjusted the resistance on the leg press machine, a small smile playing on her lips as Mrs. Henderson, a woman with a spirit as bright as her fluorescent pink tracksuit, gritted her teeth and pushed through another repetition.

"That's it, Mrs. Henderson! One more. You're a rock star!" Evelyn encouraged, her voice a soothing balm against the older woman's strained efforts.

Suddenly, the clinic doors whooshed open, letting in a gust of icy wind and a figure that seemed to have stepped out of a particularly dramatic gothic novel. A man, tall and cloaked in a black trench coat, dripped onto the pristine floor, his face obscured by the deep shadow of a fedora. He stood there, a silent sentinel, until Evelyn felt a prickle of unease crawl up her spine. He was holding something clutched tightly in his hand, and the glint of metal flashed beneath the brim of his hat.

He cleared his throat, the sound raspy and strained. "Dr. Evelyn Reed?" he asked, his voice a low rumble that vibrated in the air. "I need your help. It's... urgent."
