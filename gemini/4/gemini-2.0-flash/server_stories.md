## Opening:

The clatter of cutlery against porcelain was a relentless, percussive soundtrack to Evelyn Beatrice Bellweather’s Monday night. She pirouetted around a cluster of tables, balancing a tray laden with three steaming bowls of bouillabaisse and a precarious stack of bread baskets, her movements a carefully choreographed dance of avoidance. Her smile, fixed and slightly strained, felt as if it were glued onto her face, resistant to the genuine mirth she longed to feel.

"Bonjour, mesdames et messieurs," she announced, her voice a practiced blend of warmth and professionalism. "Enjoy your bouillabaisse."

She placed the bowls with a flourish, then subtly wiped a stray droplet of broth from her starched white apron. The scent of saffron and garlic hung heavy in the air, a fragrant shield against the lingering aroma of disappointment that clung to Evelyn like a persistent perfume. This was her life, serving expensive seafood to people who probably complained about the price of gas.

## Setting:

Evelyn worked at "Le Poisson d'Or" – The Golden Fish – a small, upscale French seafood restaurant nestled on a cobbled street in the heart of San Francisco's North Beach neighborhood. Exposed brick walls, adorned with framed vintage fishing maps and subtly nautical artwork, gave the restaurant a rustic yet sophisticated feel. Soft lighting, provided by flickering candlelight on each table and strategically placed recessed fixtures, created an intimate and romantic ambiance. The air was thick with the murmur of conversation, punctuated by the gentle clinking of glasses and the low hum of jazz emanating from a hidden speaker system. Outside, the fog rolled in from the bay, casting a silvery sheen over the vibrant street, hinting at the bohemian spirit that had once permeated every corner of this historic district, now slowly succumbing to the relentless march of gentrification. Le Poisson d'Or was clinging to its authenticity, its worn wooden floors and handwritten specials boards a defiant reminder of a time when North Beach was a haven for artists and dreamers, not just tourists and tech millionaires.
