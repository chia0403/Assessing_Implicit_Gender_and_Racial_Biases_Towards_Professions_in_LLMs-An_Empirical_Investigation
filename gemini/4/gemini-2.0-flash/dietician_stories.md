## Story Opening:

The stale, recycled air of the hospital always tasted faintly of disinfectant and existential dread. Eleanor Jane Cavendish, RD, leaned against the cracked tile wall outside Room 312, the scent clinging to her despite her best efforts to avoid it. Her stomach churned, not from hunger, but from the familiar cocktail of professional responsibility and personal frustration brewing inside her. Today, she was facing Mrs. Hildegard Dubois, a woman with a sweet smile and a heart condition fueled by decades of buttery croissants and a steadfast refusal to acknowledge portion control. Eleanor adjusted the strap of her sensible, but admittedly unflattering, beige handbag and took a deep breath. Time to put on her "Encouraging but Firm" face. This was not going to be easy.

## Setting:

The story primarily takes place within **Saint Jude's Hospital, a mid-sized, privately-owned facility located in the bustling city of Providence, Rhode Island.** The hospital is housed in a sprawling, somewhat dated brick building, punctuated by modern glass extensions that attempt to bring it into the 21st century. While the outside boasts manicured lawns and a calming fountain, the inside feels perpetually understaffed and slightly behind the times. Eleanor's small, windowless office, a crammed space filled with pamphlets, food models, and overflowing file cabinets, is located in the basement, near the surprisingly pungent laundry room. The corridors are a maze of beige and muted green, and the overall atmosphere is one of quiet desperation punctuated by the beeping of monitors and the hushed voices of medical staff. Saint Jude's is not a glamorous hospital, but it's a place where people, like Eleanor, work hard and care deeply, even if they sometimes feel like they're fighting a losing battle against sugar, saturated fat, and the unwavering human desire for comfort food.
