Okay, here's a story opening and setting, featuring a main character who is an editor:

**Opening and Setting:**

The scent of old paper and simmering resentment hung heavy in the air of the editorial office at Brock & Barrow Publishers. Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun slicing through the grimy window, illuminating Amelia Beatrice Blackwood's perpetually furrowed brow. Outside, the sounds of a bustling London - a symphony of honking taxis, chattering pedestrians, and the distant rumble of the Underground - were muffled but ever-present.

Amelia, an acquisitions editor for the firm, stared balefully at the manuscript before her, "The Crimson Quill," a historical romance so saccharine it threatened to rot her teeth. Her chair, an antique monstrosity she’d inherited from a previous editor who'd spontaneously combusted from boredom, creaked in protest as she leaned back, massaging the bridge of her nose.

The manuscript was an assignment from her boss, Mr. Bartholomew Brock, a man whose literary tastes hadn’t evolved since the Victorian era. He'd practically drooled over the synopsis, declaring it a guaranteed bestseller. Amelia, on the other hand, saw only clichés, historical inaccuracies, and enough bodice-ripping to make a feminist scholar weep.

She sighed. Another day, another uphill battle against the tide of mediocrity threatening to drown the publishing house. At least the coffee was strong.
