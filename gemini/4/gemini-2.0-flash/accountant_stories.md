Rain hammered against the grimy windows of the office building, each drop a tiny hammer blow to the already frayed edges of Arthur Reginald Penhaligonâ€™s sanity. He sat hunched over a mountain of receipts, the green glow of his monitor illuminating his tired face, a landscape of weary lines etched deep by years of number crunching. The air in his cubicle, a postage stamp-sized square carved out of the sprawling third floor, was thick with the stale scent of recycled coffee and the lingering anxiety of impending tax season.

This wasn't just any office building. This was the headquarters of "Acme Novelty and Gag Co.", purveyors of whoopee cushions, exploding cigars, and rubber chickens to the unsuspecting public. Arthur, Senior Accountant for Acme, was essentially the financial guardian of controlled chaos, tasked with making sense of a company whose entire ethos revolved around nonsensical expenditure. It was a constant uphill battle against rubber bands mysteriously charged to "Research and Development" and invoices for ten thousand novelty eyeballs, each one allegedly "essential for market analysis."

Tonight, however, the rain outside and the usual absurdity inside were conspiring to push Arthur beyond his limits. The receipts, stained with coffee and, he suspected, the remnants of some kind of exploding bubblegum, refused to balance. A looming audit by the IRS, and the image of a grumpy government auditor surrounded by piles of fart cushions, hung heavy in his mind. He was trapped, a bookkeeper in a funhouse, desperately trying to find order in a world determined to be gloriously, hilariously, and financially unsound.
