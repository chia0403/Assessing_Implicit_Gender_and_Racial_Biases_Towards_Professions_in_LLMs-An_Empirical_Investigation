Okay, here’s a story opening and setting featuring a nutritionist:

**Setting:** The late afternoon sun cast long, skeletal shadows across the polished concrete floor of "Synergy Wellness," a trendy, multi-disciplinary clinic nestled in the heart of Seattle's Fremont neighborhood. Exposed brick walls, softened by hanging ferns and the rhythmic hum of a water feature, attempted to cultivate an atmosphere of calm, but the air thrummed with the low-level anxiety of a pre-dinner rush. Outside, the distinctive aroma of brewing coffee mingled with the salty tang of the Puget Sound, a constant reminder of the city's dual nature: grounded and ever-reaching.

**Story Opening:**

Dr. Eleanor Rose Albright, PhD, RDN, perched on the edge of her ergonomic office chair, the soft leather creaking beneath her. She massaged the bridge of her nose, the faint scent of lavender essential oil clinging to her fingertips. The computer screen swam before her eyes, a relentless barrage of calorie counts, micronutrient breakdowns, and dietary recall forms. Eleanor loved her job, loved empowering people to find health and happiness through mindful eating, but today felt different. Today, the joy was buried beneath a mountain of paperwork and the lingering disquiet of her last client, a tech mogul whose bio-hacked diet involved more lab-grown protein than actual food. He'd dismissed her concerns about long-term effects with a wave of his hand and a dismissive, "Trust the science, Doctor."

Eleanor sighed, a sound barely audible above the gentle gurgle of the water feature. Maybe it was the early onset of a Seattle winter, the ever-present grayness seeping into her bones. Or maybe, just maybe, it was the cryptic, hand-delivered package that sat unopened on her desk, a package addressed to her in elegant, antique script and radiating an energy that felt…wrong. Eleanor pushed herself up, her stomach twisting with a premonition she couldn't quite decipher. Time to face the unknown, one cryptic package at a time.
