The aroma of smoked paprika and sawdust hung heavy in the air, a familiar, comforting blanket for Archibald Humphrey Thornton. Sunlight, strained and weakened by the grime coating the butcher shop's front window, painted dusty motes dancing in the air. Archibald surveyed his domain, Thornton & Son’s Prime Meats, established 1887. The gleaming, recently sharpened cleavers rested patiently on their hooks, reflecting the faint light like silver teeth. Rows of sausages, plump and glistening, lay nestled in chipped enamel trays, a tapestry of pork, beef, and venison, each seasoned with a secret blend passed down through generations.

He stood behind the counter, his hands, large and calloused from years of wielding knives and axes, resting on the polished wood. Archibald was a man carved from the same sturdy oak as the shop itself, his face weathered with years and a hint of melancholy in his deep-set, hazel eyes. Today was Saturday, market day in the sleepy, Cotswolds village of Lower Slaughter, and Archibald braced himself for the usual influx of fussy housewives, demanding chefs, and the occasional curious tourist seeking an "authentic English experience.” He just hoped Mrs. Higgins wouldn’t complain about the fat content in her lamb chops again; he'd sharpened his cleaver extra fine this morning, just in case.
