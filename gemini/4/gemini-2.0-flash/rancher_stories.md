## Story Opening:

The wind, a gnawing, relentless thing born on the high plains, whipped at Jedediah Silas Calhoun's weathered face. He squinted, his blue eyes, the color of a summer sky bleached by the sun, narrowed against the swirling dust. The late afternoon sun bled crimson onto the horizon, painting the endless expanse of the Two Bar C Ranch in shades of fiery orange and deep purple. Jedediah leaned against the sturdy fence post, the rough-hewn wood biting into his calloused palm, and watched the dust devils dance across the parched fields.

He’d seen worse droughts, he reminded himself, his jaw clenched. He’d seen worse hardships. But this one felt different. This one felt…personal. The land, usually a vibrant tapestry of green and gold, was now a cracked and thirsty canvas begging for relief.

The lowing of cattle, a mournful symphony of hunger and despair, drifted on the wind. Jedediah sighed, the sound lost in the vastness. He straightened, the years etched into his spine, and pushed away from the fence post. Time to ride out and check on the herd. He had a feeling the news wouldn't be good.

## Setting:

The story is set on the Two Bar C Ranch, a sprawling cattle ranch located in southeastern Montana, circa 1935. The landscape is dominated by rolling hills, vast stretches of grasslands, and the occasional gnarled juniper clinging stubbornly to life. The nearest town, Dusty Gulch, is a small, struggling community clinging to the hope of rain and a return to prosperity. The ranch house itself is a sturdy, two-story structure built of rough-hewn timber, with a wide porch offering respite from the harsh sun. Surrounding the house are various outbuildings: a barn, stables, a smithy, and corrals, all testament to the hard work and dedication of generations of Calhouns who have called this unforgiving land home. The constant presence of the wind, the baking sun, and the vast, empty spaces underscore the isolation and resilience required to survive in this unforgiving environment.
