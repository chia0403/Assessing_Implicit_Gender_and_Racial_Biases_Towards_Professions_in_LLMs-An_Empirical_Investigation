The rain was relentless, a hammering curtain that turned the narrow streets of Port-aux-Princes into treacherous rivers of mud. Elara Isabelle Dubois, her usually pristine linen suit clinging damply to her, cursed under her breath. She tucked a stray curl of her dark hair behind her ear, the gesture doing little to alleviate the persistent annoyance of the downpour. Elara hated Port-aux-Princes in the rain. The vibrant chaos she usually found charming – the rhythmic calls of street vendors, the pulsing music spilling from hidden doorways, the kaleidoscope of colours clinging to dilapidated buildings – all seemed to drown in the grey, leaving only a sense of grit and desperation.

Elara, a seasoned investigative journalist for the prestigious "New Global Lens" magazine, had been in Haiti for three weeks, chasing a rumour – a whisper, really – of corruption reaching the highest levels of government. The official narrative was that international aid, billions of dollars poured in after the devastating earthquake years ago, was finally making a difference. Elara’s gut told her a different story, a story of siphoned funds, inflated contracts, and shattered promises. And the deeper she dug, the more the powerful men she'd interviewed clammed up, the more her phone calls went unanswered, and the more she felt a gnawing sense of unease crawling beneath her skin.

Tonight, the feeling was particularly acute. She was meeting a potential source, a former government employee who claimed to have inside information. The meeting was arranged in a rundown bar in the Bel-Air slum, a place the expats she'd befriended at her hotel had vehemently warned her against. But Elara had learned long ago that the most valuable truths were rarely found in comfortable places. The rain lashed against the windshield of her rented Jeep as she navigated the flooded streets, a single question echoing in her mind: Was she about to uncover the story of her career, or walk straight into a trap?
