Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a concierge named Penelope Astrid Bloom:

**Setting:**

The Hotel Lux Aeterna shimmered like a frosted wedding cake against the backdrop of the Reykjavik harbour. Inside, geothermal heating radiated a comforting warmth that battled the Icelandic wind howling outside. Polished obsidian floors reflected the artfully placed spotlights, illuminating abstract sculptures crafted from lava rock and bespoke furniture upholstered in shades of glacier blue and volcanic ash. The air hummed with a hushed, expensive energy – a blend of whispered conversations, the clinking of champagne glasses in the opulent lobby bar, and the almost-silent glide of impeccably dressed staff. The Lux Aeterna wasn't just a hotel; it was an experience, a sanctuary, a carefully curated fantasy of Icelandic luxury.

**Opening:**

Penelope Astrid Bloom adjusted the silk scarf draped around her neck, the iridescent fabric catching the light and momentarily mimicking the colours of the Northern Lights. She smoothed a stray strand of her auburn hair behind her ear, a nervous habit she hadn't managed to break in the five years she'd been Head Concierge at the Lux Aeterna. From behind the sleek, curved desk of gleaming birchwood, she surveyed the lobby with a practiced eye. Everything had to be perfect. Every guest, every detail, meticulously orchestrated. Tonight, however, perfection felt particularly elusive.

The reason was leaning against a nearby pillar, his face obscured by the shadow of a wide-brimmed fedora. He'd arrived an hour ago, a single, enigmatic figure who had refused to give his name and demanded only to speak to "Ms. Bloom, personally." He reeked of intrigue, danger, and an obscenely expensive cologne that Penelope was almost certain she’d smelled once on a prince during a state visit. A prickle of unease ran down her spine. This was no ordinary guest. And Penelope Astrid Bloom had a sinking feeling that whatever he wanted, it was going to be far more complicated than booking a table at Dill.
