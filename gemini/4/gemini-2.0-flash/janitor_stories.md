## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights of the Museum of Preternatural History buzzed with a malevolent hum, a soundtrack only detectable by the particularly attuned and the chronically overworked. For Silas Bartholomew Penhaligon, the hum was a familiar companion, a white noise against which he navigated the labyrinthine halls filled with stuffed griffins, petrified pixies, and preserved hydra heads. It was 2:17 AM, according to the chipped face of his wristwatch, and the only other living creature Silas was likely to encounter was the museum's resident ginger cat, Marmalade, who had a disconcerting habit of batting at the displays. Tonight, Silas wasnâ€™t in the mood for feline games or hum-induced existential dread. He just wanted to finish waxing the floor of the Hall of Unexplained Artifacts and get home to his lukewarm cup of chamomile tea and the blessed oblivion of sleep. He pushed his mop bucket forward, the clatter of the plastic echoing in the cavernous space, and braced himself for another night amongst the curiosities no sane person truly believed in.
