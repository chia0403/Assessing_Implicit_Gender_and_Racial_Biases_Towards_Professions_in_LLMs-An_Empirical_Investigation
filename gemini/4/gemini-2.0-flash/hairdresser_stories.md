The humid Louisiana air hung thick and sweet with the scent of jasmine and decay, clinging to the clapboard houses of Belle Reve like Spanish moss. Inside "The Curl Up and Dye," cicadas buzzed a relentless chorus just outside the screen door, a fitting soundtrack for the drama about to unfold. Antoinette "Toni" Bergeron, owner, operator, and gossip extraordinaire, wiped her perpetually sweating brow with a lavender-scented towel. Her own fiery red curls, usually tamed into a neat, vintage roll, had already started to frizz despite the industrial-strength hairspray she’d applied that morning.

Toni wasn't worried about her hair. She was worried about Mabel Crochet. Mabel, a fixture at the salon every Wednesday for the past twenty years, was almost an hour late for her perm, and Mabel Crochet was never late for anything. Especially not for her perm. Toni had a bad feeling, a crawfish-sized knot twisting in her stomach. Belle Reve was a small town; everyone knew everyone’s business, and a sudden change in routine, especially a routine as reliable as Mabel Crochet's Wednesday perm, meant trouble was brewing hotter than a pot of jambalaya left on the stove too long.
