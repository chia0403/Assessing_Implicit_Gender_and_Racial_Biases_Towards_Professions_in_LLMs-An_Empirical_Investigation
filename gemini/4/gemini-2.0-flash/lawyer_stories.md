## Opening:

The stale coffee, a brownish-grey swamp at the bottom of the mug, did little to combat the chill that had settled deep in Eleanora Beatrice Thorne's bones. Outside, the pre-dawn sky was a bruise-colored purple, threatening a downpour. Perfect weather for a murder trial, she thought grimly, and even worse weather to be defending the accused. The headline, splashed across the local paper lying discarded on her desk, mocked her efforts: "MILLIONAIRE HEIRESS JAILED: DID DELANEY KILL?"

Eleanora sighed, running a hand through her perpetually messy auburn hair. She knew the answer, or at least, she *thought* she knew. Delia Delaney was innocent. But proving it... that was proving to be a monumental, Herculean task.

## Setting:

Eleanora's office occupied a precarious, top-floor space above a dusty antique shop in the historical district of Port Blossom, Maine. The building, a former whaling captain's residence, listed slightly to the left, a subtle quirk that only added to its charm. Sunlight, when it dared to break through the coastal fog, streamed through the mismatched, leaded-glass windows, casting rainbow shards across the cluttered surfaces.

The room itself was a testament to organized chaos. Stacks of legal briefs threatened to topple from every conceivable surface, vying for space with overflowing ashtrays (Eleanora was trying to quit, again), half-finished cups of coffee, and a collection of quirky antiques she’d inherited from her eccentric grandmother. A worn leather armchair sat in the corner, perpetually angled towards the harbor view, offering a brief respite from the pressures of the courtroom. The walls, painted a faded teal, were adorned with framed law degrees, old family photographs, and a surprisingly large print of Salvador Dali's "Persistence of Memory" – a visual reminder, Eleanora often thought, of the malleable nature of truth. The air hung heavy with the scent of old paper, stale coffee, and the faint, salty tang of the Atlantic, a constant reminder of the town, and its secrets, that Eleanora had sworn to protect.
