## Story Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

The hum was a constant companion, a low-frequency thrum that resonated in Amelia Finch's teeth. She’d grown so accustomed to it over the years that she barely registered it anymore, much like the smell of ozone clinging to her clothes after a long night wrestling with a temperamental vacuum tube. Tonight, however, the hum was different. It was deeper, more insistent, and pulsed with an unsettling irregularity that made the hairs on the back of her neck prickle. She gripped her soldering iron tighter, the metallic tang of fear flavoring the air. Something was wrong. Very wrong.

**Setting:**

Amelia Finch, a woman in her late thirties with perpetually grease-stained fingers and a practical bob of auburn hair perpetually threatening to escape its pins, worked out of a cramped, cluttered workshop tucked away in the attic of the *Whispering Pines Sanitarium*, a sprawling Victorian-era asylum perched on the edge of the remote, fog-shrouded Blackwood Forest. The workshop, affectionately dubbed "The Nightingale's Nest" by the patients, was a chaotic symphony of wires, dials, and discarded components. Vintage radios – some as old as the sanitarium itself – lined the walls, their dusty faces staring out like silent witnesses. The air was thick with the aroma of burnt solder, beeswax, and the faint, underlying scent of antiseptic that permeated the entire building. Outside, the wind howled, rattling the loose window panes and whistling through the gnarled branches of ancient oaks, adding another layer to the already unsettling ambiance. The year is 1947, and the world is still reeling from the echoes of war, a tension that hangs heavy in the air even within the seemingly secluded walls of Whispering Pines.
