The biting November wind whipped off Lake Michigan, stinging Detective Isabella "Izzy" Rossi's cheeks as she surveyed the scene. A yellow police tape ribbon, tattered and flapping like a dying bird, framed the entrance to a desolate stretch of beach just north of Navy Pier. The sodium glare of the city, usually a welcoming beacon, seemed to mock her tonight, painting the sand a sickly orange. A single, flickering flashlight beam cut through the darkness, held by a grim-faced patrol officer who was pointing towards something half-buried in the wet sand. Izzy pulled her collar tighter, the damp seeping through her worn leather jacket. This wasn't going to be a fun case. This was Chicago. And Chicago in November was never fun. This was the kind of cold that seeped into your bones, the kind that mirrored the despair she often felt when faced with the darkness lurking beneath the city's glittering facade.
