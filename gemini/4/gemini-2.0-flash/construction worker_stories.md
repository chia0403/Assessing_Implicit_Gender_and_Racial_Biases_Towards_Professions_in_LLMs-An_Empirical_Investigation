The biting January wind whipped across the steel girders, stinging Francisco Mateo Rodriguez's cheeks and tugging at the brim of his hardhat. He squinted, the setting sun glinting off the iced-over river below, a dizzying drop that never quite lost its power to make his stomach clench. Even after ten years of high-rise construction, the heights still got to him.

Francisco Mateo Rodriguez, a man built like the I-beams he often maneuvered, stood perched on the skeletal framework of what would one day be the Crown Point Tower, the newest addition to the rapidly expanding skyline of Chicago. The framework stretched impossibly high, a latticework of steel reaching for the pale, winter sky. Below, the city hummed, a tapestry of yellow headlights and twinkling streetlights already beginning to bloom as dusk settled. The biting wind howled a lonely song between the unfinished walls and the empty window frames, a constant reminder of the exposed vulnerability of the men who dared to build so high. Francisco took a final drag from his cigarette, the ember flaring brightly in the dying light, and flicked the butt into the wind, watching it spiral down, a tiny orange spark swallowed by the vast cityscape below. He sighed, the cold air catching in his chest. Another day done, another step closer to completion. He just hoped he'd be around to see it finished.
