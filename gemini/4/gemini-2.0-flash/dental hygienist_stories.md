**Story Opening:**

The stale, peppermint-tinged air of Harmony Smiles Dental was a familiar comfort to Delia Marguerite Dubois. She could practically taste it, a mixture of mouthwash, anxiety, and the phantom scent of her late grandfather's pipe tobacco (a habit she’d spent years gently, and ultimately unsuccessfully, dissuading him from). Today, however, the usual aroma was battling a new, acrid undertone, something akin to burnt plastic and suppressed panic. Delia wrinkled her nose, her perfectly arched eyebrows drawing together in a frown as she adjusted the overhead lamp above Mrs. Higgins, whose mouth was currently agape and filled with a terrifying landscape of overcrowded molars and a stubbornly persistent coffee stain.

"Almost done, Mrs. Higgins," Delia chirped, her voice carefully modulated to be both reassuring and slightly detached. "Just a little more plaque removal and we'll have those pearly whites sparkling."

Mrs. Higgins mumbled something unintelligible around the suction tube, likely a protest. Delia ignored it and continued her work, her gloved fingers moving with the practiced precision of a surgeon. But the strange smell wouldn’t leave her alone, a nagging premonition whispering at the edge of her awareness. She glanced towards the waiting room, where a harried-looking mother attempted to corral two squirming children. Everything seemed normal. Yet the feeling persisted, a discordant note in the otherwise predictable symphony of Harmony Smiles.

**Setting:**

Harmony Smiles Dental is a small, independent practice nestled in the heart of Harmony Falls, a quaint, postcard-perfect town in upstate New York. The office, located in a converted Victorian house, attempts to project an aura of cozy comfort. Floral wallpaper adorns the waiting room, mismatched armchairs offer a semblance of relaxation, and a fish tank bubbles gently in the corner. However, the charm is often undermined by the distinct smell of dental procedures and the ever-present hum of the drill. Inside, there are three fully equipped operatories, a small sterilization room, and a cramped staff break room perpetually smelling of instant coffee and reheated leftovers. The practice is owned and operated by Dr. Alistair Finch, a man whose bedside manner is as frosty as his perfectly starched lab coat. Delia, as his most experienced (and arguably, most empathetic) hygienist, often finds herself bridging the gap between his clinical detachment and the patients' inherent fear of the dentist's chair.
