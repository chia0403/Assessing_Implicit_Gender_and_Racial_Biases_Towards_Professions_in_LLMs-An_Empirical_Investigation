The morning dew clung to the meticulously manicured lawns of Blackwood Manor like a miser to his gold. A thin mist snaked through the ancient oaks, obscuring the gargoyles that perched precariously on the manor's roof, their stone faces perpetually frozen in expressions of disapproval. The only sound was the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of a pair of shears, wielded with practiced ease by Silas Bartholomew Finch. Silas, a man more accustomed to the company of roses than royalty, was the groundskeeper, a position heâ€™d held at Blackwood for over twenty years, longer than some of its titled residents had been alive. He knew every blade of grass, every twist of the climbing ivy, every secret whispering shadow that clung to the walls of the imposing, gothic structure. Blackwood Manor, steeped in history and whispering with rumour, sat perched on a bluff overlooking the windswept Yorkshire moors, a lonely sentinel guarding its secrets against the relentless breath of the northern wind. It was a place of quiet grandeur, where the rustling of leaves often sounded like ghostly murmurs and the echoing clang of the ancient iron gates sent shivers down the spine, even on the brightest summer day. Today, however, the usual quiet was punctuated by a palpable tension in the air, a feeling Silas could practically taste, acrid and metallic, like the coming of a storm. He paused, the shears suspended mid-air, and straightened his aching back. Something was definitely amiss.
