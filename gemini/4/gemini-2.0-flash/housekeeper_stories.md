## The Story Opening:

The scent of lemon and old money hung heavy in the air, a fragrance Eleanor Ainsworth knew intimately. It was the perfume of the Oakhaven Estate, and more specifically, the scent of Mrs. Henrietta Thornton's relentless dedication to perfection. Eleanor, perched precariously on a wobbly stepladder, paused in her dusting of a particularly ornate, and utterly hideous, porcelain shepherdess. A tremor, barely perceptible, vibrated through the floorboards. Another visitor, no doubt. Henrietta Thornton was a woman who collected both porcelain and people, preferring them both fragile and perfectly positioned for her amusement. Eleanor sighed. This was likely to mean more work, more expectations, and more opportunities to be invisibly reprimanded for some imagined infraction. She hoped, at least, it wasnâ€™t Mr. Bartholomew Thornton. His visits always left a lingering unease that took a special kind of scrubbing to wash away.

## The Setting:

**Oakhaven Estate, Surrey, England, 1938:**

Oakhaven was a gothic monstrosity draped in ivy, a testament to generations of Thorntons and their accumulation of wealth, eccentricities, and secrets. The house, built in the late Victorian era, boasted a labyrinthine network of corridors, towering ceilings adorned with gloomy paintings, and an endless array of rooms filled with antique furniture, priceless trinkets, and the accumulated dust of decades. Sunlight struggled to penetrate the stained-glass windows, casting the interior in a perpetually somber light.

The estate grounds were equally imposing: manicured gardens that stretched as far as the eye could see, a crumbling walled garden teeming with wildflowers, a dense, ancient wood rumored to be haunted by the ghost of a heartbroken governess, and a stagnant lake that mirrored the heavy, oppressive atmosphere of the house itself. It was a place of whispers and shadows, a place where secrets thrived in the silence. Eleanor, despite working there for five years, still felt like an outsider looking in, forever on the periphery of the Thornton family's strange, self-contained world.
