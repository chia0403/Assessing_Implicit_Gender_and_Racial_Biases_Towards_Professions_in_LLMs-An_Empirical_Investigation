## Story Opening:

The wrench slipped, biting into Arthur Reginald Higgins' knuckle and drawing a sharp, unexpected yelp. Arthur, a man who prided himself on his stoic professionalism, cursed under his breath, the sound swallowed by the echoing drip, drip, drip of the leaky pipe mocking him. He wiped the small trickle of blood on his already grease-stained overalls, the scent of damp and decay clinging to him like a second skin. He hated Wednesdays. They always seemed to bring the worst plumbing emergencies, the kind that tested the limits of his patience and the integrity of aging copper pipes. Today, Wednesday had delivered him Mrs. Periwinkle and her overflowing toilet.

## Setting:

Arthur found himself squeezed into the cramped, floral-wallpapered confines of Mrs. Periwinkle's downstairs bathroom. The house, a Victorian relic nestled amongst the newly renovated townhouses of Willow Creek, smelled faintly of potpourri and cat. The linoleum floor, patterned with faded daisies, was damp and slick. A porcelain cat, missing an ear, perched precariously on the edge of the toilet tank, its painted eyes seeming to judge his every move. Sunlight, filtered through a lace-curtained window, cast a dusty golden glow on the scene, highlighting the cobwebs clinging to the ornate, but obviously leaking, radiator in the corner. Every surface seemed covered in some sort of knick-knack, a testament to a life lived amidst cherished clutter. It was the kind of bathroom where history seeped from the walls, a history Arthur wasn't sure he wanted to be a part of, especially not with the looming threat of sewage backup.
