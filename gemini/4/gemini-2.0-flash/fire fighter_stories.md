The smell of burnt sugar and something indefinably worse clung to Amelia Grace Hawthorne's nostrils, even hours after she’d showered. It was a smell that followed her home now, clung to her dreams, a permanent reminder of the job. She swiveled in her worn-out desk chair, the cheap pleather squeaking in protest, and stared out the rain-streaked window. The early evening sky over Port Blossom, Maine, was a bruised purple, mirroring the ache in her shoulder from yesterday's fallen beam.

Port Blossom wasn’t a town known for raging infernos. More often, it was faulty wiring in the historic clapboard houses, or unattended lobster pots left to simmer dry on weekend escapes. But yesterday had been different. The old Victorian on Seafoam Avenue, rumored to be haunted, had gone up like a tinderbox, the flames licking at the ornate gingerbread trim with hungry glee. Despite the best efforts of the crew, and Amelia’s particularly daring ascent to rescue a trapped cat (a cat that, she later learned, had probably escaped hours before the fire started), the house was a total loss.

The rain intensified, drumming against the corrugated metal roof of the Port Blossom Fire Station #1. Inside, the air was thick with the aroma of stale coffee and boot polish, punctuated by the periodic crackle of the radio and the quiet murmurs of the evening shift settling in. Amelia was off-duty, technically. But the hollow ache in her chest, a persistent companion since her father, also a firefighter in Port Blossom, had passed away five years ago, kept her chained to the station, to the camaraderie, to the ever-present possibility of another call.
