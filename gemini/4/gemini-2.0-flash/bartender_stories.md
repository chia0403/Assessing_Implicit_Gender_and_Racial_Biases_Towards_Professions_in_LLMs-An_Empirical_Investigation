## Story Opening:

The rhythmic clinking of glass against glass was the only constant in the swirling chaos that was "The Serpent's Kiss" on a Friday night. Rain lashed against the stained-glass windows, blurring the neon signs of the strip outside into watery, abstract art. Eleanor "Ellie" Beatrice Hawthorne, expertly pouring a shot of something amber and potent, barely registered it. Tonight was a battle, a test of endurance, and she was armed with a shaker, a witty retort, and a frankly alarming tolerance for spilled beer.

A roar erupted from the cluster huddled around the pool table, followed by a cacophony of jeers and triumphant whoops. Ellie sighed, the sound lost in the general din. She caught the eye of the grizzled regular, Hank, nursing his usual whiskey neat at the end of the bar. He just shook his head, a familiar, knowing look on his face. "Just another night, eh, Ellie?"

She flashed him a weary smile. "Just another night, Hank. Just another night keeping the demons at bay, one drink at a time."

**Setting:**

The Serpent's Kiss was a dive bar tucked away in the less-than-reputable side of Oakhaven, a coastal city known more for its salty air and tourist traps than its vibrant nightlife. The interior was perpetually dim, lit by flickering neon signs advertising cheap beer and the aforementioned stained-glass windows which, despite their age and grime, lent a bizarre, almost ecclesiastical air to the place. The walls were a patchwork of faded posters for local bands, questionable liquor ads, and graffiti that had long since been deemed "part of the atmosphere." The air hung heavy with the scent of stale beer, cheap cigarettes, and something vaguely floral that Ellie suspected was an aggressively-scented air freshener fighting a losing battle. The bar itself was long and scarred, bearing the marks of countless spilled drinks, drunken arguments, and the occasional fist fight. It was, in short, exactly the kind of place Ellie Beatrice Hawthorne felt most comfortable in.
