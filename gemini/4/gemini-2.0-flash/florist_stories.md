Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a florist named: **Seraphina Beatrice Bellweather**.

**Setting:**

The setting is a small, slightly dilapidated storefront in the heart of New Orleans’ French Quarter. The building, affectionately known as "Bellweather Blooms," sits on a quieter side street, away from the raucous bustle of Bourbon Street but close enough to catch the scent of beignets and the mournful wail of a lone trumpet player at dusk. Sunlight filters weakly through the tall, arched windows, often obscured by dust and the riot of color spilling from overflowing vases and hanging baskets. The air inside is thick with the heady fragrance of roses, lilies, and a faint, lingering aroma of the chicory coffee Seraphina brews in the back room. The walls are painted a faded, almost sickly green, peeling in places to reveal glimpses of a cheerful sunflower yellow underneath. A worn, wooden counter, scarred with years of spilled water and floral tape residue, dominates the space, cluttered with invoices, ribbon scraps, and Seraphina’s ever-present sketchbook.

**Opening:**

Seraphina Beatrice Bellweather hated orchids. Absolutely loathed them. The pretentious, air-snob flowers, demanding the perfect humidity and filtered light, were a constant source of frustration. Today, a particularly haughty phalaenopsis, its pristine white blooms practically sneering at her, was the recipient of her silent wrath. She jabbed a chopstick into its pot, aerating the soil with more force than necessary.

“Honestly,” she muttered, her breath fogging the dusty windowpane. “You’d think being admired at a debutante ball would be enough for you. But no, you need a goddamn symphony of attention.”

A tinkling bell above the door announced a customer, startling Seraphina. She quickly smoothed her unruly auburn hair, wiped her ink-stained fingers on her apron, and pasted on the most charming smile she could muster, hoping, just this once, it wasn't a request for *another* orchid arrangement. The smile faltered slightly as she peered up, noticing the figure standing awkwardly in the doorway: a tall, stoic man whose very presence seemed to drain the colour out of the surrounding blooms. He certainly wasn't here for orchids.
