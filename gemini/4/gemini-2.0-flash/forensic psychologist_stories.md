## Opening:

The smell of stale coffee and desperation clung to the air like a cheap cologne. Dr. Vivian Holloway adjusted her glasses, the fluorescent lights of the interrogation room doing little to flatter the deep circles under her eyes. Across the steel table, a young man named Daniel held her gaze with an unnerving calm. He was meticulously tearing a paper napkin into tiny squares, each movement precise and deliberate, a stark contrast to the chaos he was accused of unleashing.

"Daniel," Vivian began, her voice low and even, a trained counterpoint to the frantic energy that vibrated in the room, "Can you tell me again what you remember about the night of the fire?"

He didn't flinch. Just kept tearing.

"I've told the police everything," he murmured, his voice barely audible.

Vivian leaned forward. "I know. But tell me. Tell me for yourself."

She could practically feel the invisible wall he had erected between himself and the rest of the world, a fortress built of denial and, perhaps, something far darker. She had to find a way to breach it, to peel back the layers of carefully constructed composure and reach the truth that lay buried within. Because if she didn't, a dangerous man might walk free, and Vivian would be haunted by the consequences.

## Setting:

The setting is the stark, utilitarian interrogation room of the **Evergreen County Sheriff's Department** in rural Washington state. The walls are painted a drab, institutional green, scarred with the marks of countless tense encounters. A single, buzzing fluorescent light fixture hangs precariously from the ceiling. The room is sparsely furnished: a steel table bolted to the floor, two uncomfortable chairs, and a one-way mirror separating the interrogation room from the observation area. The air is thick with the scent of disinfectant and lingering anxieties, a testament to the countless stories of crime and confession that have played out within its sterile confines. Evergreen County, typically a peaceful, picturesque area known for its towering pines and misty valleys, has been rocked by a series of escalating arsons, culminating in the tragic deaths of a local family. The pressure on the Sheriff's Department, and on Dr. Holloway, is immense. The idyllic facade of Evergreen is crumbling, revealing a darker underbelly of secrets and resentments.
