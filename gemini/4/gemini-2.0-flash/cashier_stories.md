The fluorescent lights of the Quick Stop convenience store hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Elara Jane Abernathyâ€™s Friday night shift. Outside, the town of Havenwood buzzed with the anticipatory energy of the weekend. Inside, Elara stacked magazines with practiced precision, the scent of stale coffee and lottery tickets clinging to the air like a persistent perfume.

Havenwood wasn't exactly known for its excitement. Nestled deep in the Appalachian foothills, its main claim to fame was the annual Apple Butter Festival, and even that was a stretch. Elara, with her vibrant purple streaks in her otherwise mousy brown hair and a stack of dog-eared sci-fi novels hidden under the counter, felt like a brightly colored bird trapped in a beige cage.

She sighed, pushing a stray strand of hair behind her ear. The digital clock on the microwave ticked slowly, agonizingly towards 11 PM. Three more hours. Three more hours of small talk about the weather, complaints about the price of gas, and the occasional mumbled apology from someone trying to buy beer after curfew. Three more hours until she could escape back to the relative quiet of her tiny apartment above the laundromat and lose herself in the far-flung galaxies of her books. Tonight, though, she felt a restless energy simmering beneath the surface, a feeling that something, anything, was about to change.
