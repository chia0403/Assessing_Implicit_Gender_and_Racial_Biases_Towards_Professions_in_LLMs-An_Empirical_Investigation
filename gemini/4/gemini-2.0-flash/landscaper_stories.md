## Story Opening:

The scent of freshly cut fescue clung to Leo Maxwell’s denim shirt like a loyal hound. He wiped a bead of sweat from his brow, leaving a smudge of soil on his already sun-kissed skin. The midday sun, a merciless tyrant in July, beat down on his back as he wrestled a stubborn rhododendron into its designated hole. He swore under his breath, a quiet curse swallowed by the whir of the sprinklers testing in the newly installed flowerbeds.

Leo Maxwell didn't usually mind the heat. He was a landscaper, after all. Sunshine was his bread and butter, the lifeblood of the vibrant gardens he brought to life. But today, the oppressive humidity hung heavy in the air, making each movement feel like wading through molasses. And the rhododendron? It was fighting him every inch of the way, its roots tangled like a grumpy old man’s beard.

He glanced over at the expansive, meticulously manicured lawn that was now his latest masterpiece. It was almost complete. Just a few finishing touches, a final sweep of the patio, and Mrs. Featherstone would be able to throw her extravagant summer garden party with pride. He just hoped he could finish before the inevitable afternoon thunderstorm rolled in.

## Setting:

The story is set in **Bridgewater, Connecticut, in the heart of the Litchfield Hills.** The town is a picture-postcard example of New England charm: rolling green hills dotted with stone walls, antique farmhouses meticulously restored, and an abundance of stately oaks and maples providing welcome shade. The residents are largely wealthy professionals who have escaped the hustle and bustle of New York City, seeking a slower pace of life and a connection with nature.

Specifically, Leo is working on the grounds of **"Featherstone Estate," a sprawling property owned by Mrs. Eleanor Featherstone, a prominent socialite known for her lavish parties and impeccable taste.** The estate boasts a grand Georgian-style mansion, a sparkling blue pool, a sprawling rose garden, and a newly constructed patio overlooking a breathtaking vista of the surrounding countryside. The gardens are meticulously planned and maintained, a testament to Mrs. Featherstone's commitment to beauty and perfection, and a constant source of pressure for Leo Maxwell to deliver his best work.
