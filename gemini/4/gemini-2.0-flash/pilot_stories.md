The biting wind whipped at Amelia Grace Harding's exposed cheeks, stinging her skin even through the worn leather of her bomber jacket. Dawn was just beginning to paint the Alaskan sky with streaks of a sickly yellow and bruised purple, mimicking the colours of the tundra below. From her vantage point, perched precariously on the wing of her aging de Havilland Beaver, she could see for miles â€“ an endless, unforgiving expanse of snow-dusted mountains and frozen lakes. The air itself felt solid, a wall of ice she would soon have to punch through.

Amelia inhaled deeply, the icy air burning in her lungs. She wasn't a morning person, not even close. But the village of Nanwalek was running dangerously low on medical supplies, and the radio crackling to life in her cockpit had brought a desperate plea for help. Now, here she was, wrestling with frozen fuel lines and the ever-present fear of a whiteout, all before the sun had even fully broken the horizon. This was bush flying, Alaska style, and Amelia Grace Harding lived and breathed it, even when it threatened to freeze her solid.
