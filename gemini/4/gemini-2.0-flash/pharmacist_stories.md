**Story Opening:**

The bell above the door of "The Clover Apothecary" chimed a weary, almost apologetic tune, muffled by the biting February wind that rattled the old glass windows. Elias Thorne, the man behind the counter, barely registered it. His focus was entirely consumed by the mortar and pestle in his hands, grinding a mixture of dried chamomile and lavender into a fine, fragrant powder. He watched the swirling herbs, the familiar rhythm a grounding force in a day that had already felt ten hours long despite only just reaching lunchtime. He was chasing a phantom headache with a chamomile tea blend, hoping to preempt the full-blown migraine that threatened to bloom behind his eyes.

He was just about to transfer the ground mixture to a small tin when a shadow fell across his countertop. Elias sighed, a sound barely audible over the mournful creak of the old building settling. He knew, without looking up, it was Mrs. Henderson, whose endless litany of ailments and eccentric remedies were a daily fixture at The Clover Apothecary. He steeled himself, preparing to launch into his practiced speech about the dangers of unproven herbal treatments, while secretly sympathizing with her desperate search for relief.

**Setting:**

The Clover Apothecary sat nestled on the corner of Elm Street and Willow Avenue in the small, perpetually-gray town of Havenwood, nestled deep in the Pennsylvania mountains. The building itself was a charming, if somewhat dilapidated, two-story Victorian with a faded green facade and gingerbread trim that had seen better days.

Inside, the air was thick with the comforting scent of dried herbs, beeswax polish, and faintly antiseptic alcohol. Rows of glass jars lined the walls, filled with everything from common chamomile and peppermint to more obscure ingredients like mugwort and valerian root. The mahogany shelves were packed with antique pharmacy bottles, meticulously labeled in faded ink, some dating back to the apothecary's original opening in 1888. A large, cast-iron scale sat on the counter, its brass pans gleaming under the soft glow of an Edison bulb hanging from the pressed-tin ceiling. The room was a testament to a bygone era, a pocket of old-world charm resisting the relentless march of modernity that seemed to have bypassed Havenwood entirely. It was a place where time moved slower, and the cure for what ailed you might just be found in a carefully crafted herbal remedy or a sympathetic ear.
