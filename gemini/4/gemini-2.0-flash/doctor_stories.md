## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The year is 1888. London is choked with fog and rumour, a city both vibrant and desperately poor. Gas lamps flicker, casting long, dancing shadows on cobbled streets. Jack the Ripper stalks the East End, and the air hangs thick with a palpable sense of fear and unease. Tonight, a particularly acrid fog has descended, a pea-souper that clings to everything, smelling of soot and the Thames.

**Opening:**

The bell above the door of Dr. Alistair Hawthorneâ€™s surgery jingled a discordant welcome, a sound he'd grown weary of over the years. He barely glanced up from the autopsy report spread across his desk, its grim details illuminated by the flickering gas lamp. The fog, thick as a shroud, pressed against the windowpanes, muting the sounds of the city. He could still hear the distant rumble of a carriage, though, and the mournful wail of a foghorn from the river. Alistair rubbed his tired eyes, the scent of formaldehyde clinging to his fingertips. He hadn't slept properly in days, not since the Miller's Court murder. The image of Mary Jane Kelly, so brutally butchered, haunted his waking hours, a constant reminder of the darkness that festered in the heart of London. He knew, with a chilling certainty, that this was only the beginning.
