**Opening:**

The smell of iodine and scared animal mingled in the air, a familiar and comforting perfume to Dr. Amelia Rosewood.  She kneaded the tense muscles of a quivering, chihuahua-sized mutt, murmuring soothing words.  "Easy there, Peanut. Just a little longer."  Peanut, aptly named for his coloring and general nervousness, whimpered and tried to burrow deeper into Amelia's arm.  Outside, the rhythmic clang of distant church bells fought a losing battle against the raucous squawking emanating from a parrot named Captain in the waiting room.  Amelia sighed, a sound that held equal parts frustration and affection.  This was Friday evening in Havenwood, and things were just getting started.

**Setting:**

Havenwood, nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, was the kind of town where everyone knew everyone else's business, and the local gossip travelled faster than the bluegrass banjo tunes that spilled from the porch of the general store on Saturday nights.  Dr. Amelia Rosewood's veterinary clinic, "Havenwood Animal Hospital," was a converted Victorian house, painted a cheerful but slightly faded yellow.  The sprawling porch was usually adorned with overflowing pots of petunias (despite the occasional nibble from a visiting deer), and a rocking chair sat invitingly, though Amelia rarely had time to use it.  Inside, the waiting room was a chaotic but cozy mix of mismatched furniture, tattered magazines featuring farm animals, and an ever-present layer of dog hair. Examination rooms were small and functional, with stainless steel tables and walls lined with charts detailing the medical histories of Havenwood's beloved pets - from pampered Persians to stubborn mules.  Out back, a small, fenced-in yard provided space for animals to stretch their legs and, hopefully, relieve themselves before heading home.  The entire place was a testament to Amelia's practical, compassionate approach to veterinary medicine, a comforting haven for the furry, feathered, and scaled residents of Havenwood and the surrounding farms.
