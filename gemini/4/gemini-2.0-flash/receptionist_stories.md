The flickering fluorescent light above her head hummed a monotonous tune that mirrored Eleanor Jane Harding's increasingly monotonous day. Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of the Obsidian Corp building, blurring the cityscape into an indistinct smear of greys and blues. From her vantage point behind the sleek, minimalist reception desk – a stark contrast to the overflowing teacup rings staining her own kitchen table at home – Eleanor watched the early evening sky bleed a darker shade of despair. It was 5:57 PM. Three more agonizing minutes until freedom.

Obsidian Corp, a cutting-edge tech firm specializing in something Eleanor still couldn't quite grasp despite having worked there for six months (something involving algorithms and proprietary data sets, mostly), was eerily quiet now. The usual frantic tap-tapping of keyboards and the hushed drone of brainstorming sessions had evaporated, leaving only the rhythmic swish of the automatic doors opening and closing as weary employees escaped into the downpour. Eleanor sighed, stretching her fingers, and glanced at the clock again. Two minutes and thirty seconds. She could almost taste the cheap instant coffee awaiting her in her apartment, the familiar comfort of bad reality television, and the sweet, sweet oblivion of another day survived. If only the phone wouldn't ring. Just once.
