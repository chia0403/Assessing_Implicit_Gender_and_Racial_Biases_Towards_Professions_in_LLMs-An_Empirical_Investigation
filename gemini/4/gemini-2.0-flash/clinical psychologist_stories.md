The rain hammered against the windows of Dr. Eleanor Ainsworthâ€™s office, a rhythmic percussion that almost, *almost*, drowned out the incessant ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner. Almost. Eleanor found the clock both comforting and infuriating; a steadfast, predictable presence in a world increasingly defined by chaos, and yet, a constant reminder of time slipping away, page by page, day by day.

Her office, located on the third floor of a converted Victorian house in the historic district of Alexandria, Virginia, was designed to be a sanctuary, a haven from the storm. Warm, buttery-yellow walls held framed prints of Rothko paintings - their abstract forms meant to encourage contemplation, not dictate meaning. A plush, Persian rug softened the creaks of the aged floorboards. Sunlight, when it deigned to appear, streamed through the large, arched windows, bathing the room in a soft, ethereal glow. But today, the storm ruled, casting long, somber shadows that danced and writhed with the rhythm of the deluge.

Eleanor sat perched on the edge of her antique, mahogany desk, her hands clasped tightly in her lap. A half-empty mug of Earl Grey tea sat cooling beside a stack of patient files, their contents pressing down on her like physical weights. The storm outside mirrored the storm brewing inside her; a tempest of doubt, fear, and a gnawing unease that had been plaguing her for weeks, ever since the arrival of *that* file. The file of Mr. Silas Blackwood.
