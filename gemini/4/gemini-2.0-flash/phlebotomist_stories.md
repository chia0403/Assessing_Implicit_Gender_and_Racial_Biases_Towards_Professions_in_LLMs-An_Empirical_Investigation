Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a phlebotomist named Amelia Grace Harding:

**Opening:**

The fluorescent lights of the Mercy General Outpatient Clinic buzzed with a relentless, almost sentient hum. Amelia Grace Harding barely registered it anymore. After five years of sticking needles into the arms of anxious, tired, and sometimes downright hostile patients, the incessant drone had become a part of the soundtrack to her life, as familiar as the squeak of her shoes on the linoleum floor. Today, however, the hum seemed amplified, a low-grade anxiety mimicking the thrumming in her own chest. It was the same every Monday morning, that pre-dawn dread that clung to her like the smell of antiseptic. But this Monday felt different. More significant, somehow. It wasn't just the usual post-weekend blues. Amelia had a feeling, a whisper in the back of her mind, that today was going to be one of *those* days.

**Setting:**

The Mercy General Outpatient Clinic was nestled in the heart of the rust belt city of Millhaven, Pennsylvania. It was a sprawling, single-story building, perpetually caught between a facelift and crumbling infrastructure. The waiting room was perpetually crowded with a mix of the uninsured, the underinsured, and the simply weary. Faded floral wallpaper peeled at the edges, attempting to mask the building's age and the weight of the city's hardships.

Amelia's small phlebotomy station, "Station 3," was a cramped space dominated by a worn examination chair, a stainless steel tray overflowing with vacutainers, tourniquets, and alcohol wipes, and a computer monitor that flickered with patient charts. A single, sad-looking philodendron in a cracked ceramic pot sat on the windowsill, a testament to Amelia's dedication to finding beauty even in the most sterile of environments. A worn-out poster displaying the correct order of draw for blood tubes hung crookedly behind her, a silent reminder of the precision and attention to detail her job demanded. Outside the narrow window, the bleak November sky threatened snow, mirroring the graying hope in Millhaven.
