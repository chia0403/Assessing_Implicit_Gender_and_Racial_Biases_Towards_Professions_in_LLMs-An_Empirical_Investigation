The setting: A pre-dawn chill clung to the air around US Route 50, nestled in the rugged, pine-clad mountains of Western Maryland. The asphalt, cracked and worn by years of heavy truck traffic and harsh winters, reflected the faint glow of the rising moon, making it look like a silver river winding through the dense forest. Fog, thick as cotton batting, swirled in the low-lying areas, obscuring the shoulder and swallowing the warning cones already being strategically placed. The only sounds were the rhythmic chirp of crickets, soon to be drowned out by the inevitable roar of engines, and the metallic clang of metal on metal as the work crew began to assemble.

The opening:

A sigh escaped the lips of Bartholomew "Bart" Finch, a plume of condensation blooming briefly in the frigid air. He tightened his grip on the handle of the traffic wand, its orange glow a small defiant spark against the encroaching darkness. Bart Finch had seen a lot of sunrises from this stretch of highway, a lot of sunrises that looked just like this one – cold, gray, and promising another long day of dodging speeding cars and breathing in asphalt fumes. He’d been patching potholes on Route 50 for almost twenty years, and the romance of the open road had long since faded, replaced by a weary resignation. But Bart Finch was a man of routine, and routine was his anchor in a life that sometimes felt as precarious and patched together as the highway he labored to maintain. He adjusted his hard hat, its brim casting a shadow over his tired eyes, and with a grunt, swung open the door of the Department of Transportation pick-up, ready to face another day on the unforgiving blacktop.
