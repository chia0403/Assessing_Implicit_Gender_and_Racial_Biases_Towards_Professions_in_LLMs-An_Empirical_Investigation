## Opening:

The salt spray kissed Amelia Hayes’s face, a familiar balm to her perpetually over-stimulated mind. She gripped the railing of the ferry, her knuckles white against the weathered wood, and inhaled deeply. This was her ritual, the same ferry, the same time, the same bracing breath that always, eventually, helped quiet the buzzing chaos within. Today, however, the usual tranquility was proving elusive. The words, usually clamoring for attention, were refusing to coalesce, leaving only a frustrating, echoing silence.

She needed this retreat. After the disastrous book tour, the scathing reviews, and the well-meaning but ultimately suffocating comfort of her family, she needed to disappear, to find herself again, or at least find her voice.

The groan of the ferry's horn pierced the air, signaling their imminent arrival. Amelia closed her eyes, bracing herself. Hope flickered, fragile as a butterfly’s wing. Maybe, just maybe, on this remote island, surrounded by nothing but crashing waves and whispering pines, she could coax those elusive words back to life.

## Setting:

The story unfolds on **Sanctuary Island**, a small, sparsely populated island off the coast of Maine. It's characterized by its rugged coastline, dotted with jagged cliffs and hidden coves. The interior is a tapestry of dense pine forests and sprawling blueberry barrens, crisscrossed by winding hiking trails. The island has a small, tight-knit community of fishermen, artists, and retirees who value their privacy and independence. The pace of life is slow, dictated by the rhythms of the sea and the seasons. The air is thick with the scent of salt, pine, and woodsmoke, a constant reminder of the island's wild and untamed spirit.
