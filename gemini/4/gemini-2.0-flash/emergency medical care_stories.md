Okay, here's a story opening with the setting and full name of the main character, an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT):

**Opening:**

The insistent bleat of the pager cut through the lull of a late Tuesday afternoon. Dr. Pepper, lukewarm and forgotten, sat stubbornly sweating rings on the dashboard of the ambulance. A sigh, heavy with the kind of fatigue that settles in your bones after a double shift, escaped the lips of **Isabelle Marie “Izzy” Rodriguez**. She snatched the pager from her belt clip, the digital display glowing with a string of numbers she knew by heart: Dispatch. Her heart, which had been momentarily resting at a steady rhythm, picked up the pace. Always did.

**Setting:**

The story is set in the fictional town of Havenwood, nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains in Western North Carolina. Havenwood is a small, close-knit community, primarily comprised of families who have lived in the area for generations. The town's economy relies on a mix of tourism (attracted by the scenic mountain views and hiking trails), small-scale agriculture, and a struggling manufacturing plant.

The EMS station, Havenwood Rescue Squad, is a modest brick building located just off Main Street, a testament to the town's limited budget but also to the dedication of its volunteer and paid staff. It houses two ambulances, a small office space crammed with paperwork and medical supplies, and a break room that smells perpetually of reheated coffee and microwave popcorn.

Izzy, being on duty, is currently sitting in Ambulance One, parked in its designated bay, waiting for the next call. The sunlight slants through the open garage door, illuminating the dust motes dancing in the air and highlighting the worn patches on the vinyl seats. You can hear the distant drone of a chainsaw from a nearby property, a typical sound in Havenwood.
