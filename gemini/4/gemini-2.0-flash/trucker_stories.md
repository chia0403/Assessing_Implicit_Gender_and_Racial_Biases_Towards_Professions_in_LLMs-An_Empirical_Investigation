The setting was a greasy spoon diner just outside of Amarillo, Texas. The sky, still bleeding a deep indigo from the dying night, cast long, skeletal shadows from the wind turbines that dotted the horizon like giant, sleeping insects. Inside, the air hung thick with the aroma of day-old coffee, burnt bacon, and desperation. Neon signs flickered erratically in the windows, promising “Hot Food!” and “Trucker Friendly!” - promises only partially kept.

Behind the chipped Formica counter, a woman with a permanent sneer etched onto her face, named Agnes, poured coffee from a pot that looked older than the state of Texas itself. The clatter of silverware and the low hum of conversation fought for dominance, a constant, monotonous drone only broken by the occasional roar of an 18-wheeler rumbling down Route 66.

In a booth tucked away in the back, nursing a cup of that bitter coffee and staring out the window, sat **Arthur "Art" Clarence Miller**, a man built like the Peterbilt he drove. His face, weathered and etched with the miles, was framed by a worn-out trucker hat that read "Miller Time - All the Time." Art was a man of few words, but his eyes, a startlingly bright blue, held a story of long nights on the road, loneliness, and a quiet, enduring strength. He wasn't looking for conversation, just a warm cup of coffee and a few moments of peace before another day of hauling freight across the endless expanse of America's highways. Today’s load: a shipment of frozen chickens, headed for Denver. He just hoped his rig held out. That rattle in the engine was starting to sound an awful lot like trouble.
