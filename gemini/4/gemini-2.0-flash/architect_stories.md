## Opening:

The salt-laced wind whipped Amelia Stonecipher's hair across her face as she clung to the railing of the ferry, her gaze fixed on the jagged, moss-covered cliffs of Eilean Mòr. The tiny island, barely a blip on most maps of the Outer Hebrides, rose starkly from the churning grey sea, whispering promises of both breathtaking beauty and bone-chilling isolation. For years, she’d dreamt of this moment, of finally setting foot on the site that had consumed her thoughts, her sketches, and her very sleep. But now, standing on the precipice of her dream, a tremor of unease ran through her. The wind, she decided, was a little too insistent, the cries of the gulls a little too mournful.

## Setting:

The story is set in the Outer Hebrides, specifically on the small, remote island of Eilean Mòr. It's late autumn, with the days growing short and the weather unpredictable. The landscape is harsh and rugged, characterized by windswept moors, rocky coastlines, and dramatic cliffs. The only signs of human habitation are a crumbling, abandoned lighthouse at the island's highest point, and the skeletal remains of a few stone croft houses further inland. The island has a bleak, haunting beauty, steeped in local folklore and rumored to be a place of ancient secrets. The oppressive silence, broken only by the wind and the sea, amplifies the feeling of isolation and vulnerability.
