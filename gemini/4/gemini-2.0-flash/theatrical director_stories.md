## The Story Opening

The aroma of dust and forgotten dreams hung heavy in the air of the Grand Majestic Theatre, a smell that, to Alistair Finch, was sweeter than any perfume. He stood center stage, the single work light casting long, skeletal shadows across the velvet seats, now faded and patched like an old soldier’s uniform. Alistair ran a hand through his already disheveled silver hair, his fingers catching on a rogue strand. It was a losing battle, this daily attempt to tame the tempest that was his head.

"Right then," he announced to the empty theatre, his voice echoing off the gilded balconies. "Let's bring this beast back to life, shall we?"

He snapped his fingers, a sharp, theatrical gesture that would send shivers down the spine of any actor. He hadn't felt this invigorated, this…alive, in years. The Grand Majestic, his Grand Majestic, was about to breathe again. He just needed to find a play, a cast, and a miracle. And preferably, before the bank foreclosed.
 
## The Setting

**Location:** The Grand Majestic Theatre, a crumbling but beautiful opera house in the heart of a forgotten, working-class district of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

**Time:** Late October, present day. The city is shrouded in the crisp, cool air of autumn, with leaves turning vibrant shades of red, orange, and gold.

**Atmosphere:** The theatre itself is a paradoxical space - grand and opulent in its original design, yet decaying and neglected in its current state. Chipped paint reveals layers of history, dusty chandeliers hang precariously, and the plush velvet seats are worn thin. The area surrounding the theatre reflects a similar story of faded glory, with boarded-up storefronts and the remnants of a once-thriving community. Despite the dilapidation, there's a palpable sense of history and a lingering hope for revitalization. The scent of coal smoke mingles with the sweet aroma of falling leaves, creating a uniquely Pittsburghian atmosphere.
