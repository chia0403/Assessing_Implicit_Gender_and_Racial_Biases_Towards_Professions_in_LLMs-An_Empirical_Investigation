## Story Opening:

The air hung thick and heavy, less air than solid grit and dust.  It coated everything in a fine, rust-colored film: the cab of the Caterpillar D11T dozer, the stubby bristles of Jebediah Silas Thorne's perpetually unkempt beard, even the sweat that beaded on his brow and threatened to sting his eyes.  He wiped it away with the back of a calloused hand, leaving a smear of crimson earth in its wake.  Below him, the yawning maw of the pit echoed with the grumble of a thousand mechanical beasts, each gnawing at the earth in search of the precious seam of copper that pulsed beneath. Jebediah Silas Thorne wasn't thinking about the copper though.  He was thinking about the ham sandwich his wife, Martha, had packed him.  He was pretty sure the mayonnaise had gone bad.

## Setting:

The setting is the “Anaconda Copper Mine,” a gargantuan open-pit mine carved out of the foothills of the Anaconda Range in southwest Montana, USA.  It's a brutal landscape of raw earth, blasted rock, and the constant cacophony of heavy machinery. The air is thick with dust, the sun beats down mercilessly during the day, and temperatures plummet at night.  The mine itself is a vast, terraced crater that stretches for miles, revealing layers of earth that tell a million-year-old story.  Jebediah, like many men in the region, lives in the small, company-owned town of Opportunity, clinging precariously to the side of a hill overlooking the mine. The town is a patchwork of weathered houses, dusty roads, and the ever-present reminder of the mine that sustains and consumes them all. The mine isn’t just a job; it’s the lifeblood, the history, and the uncertain future of Opportunity.
