## Story Opening:

The rain, a persistent, needling rain that felt determined to burrow under even the most expensive umbrella, mirrored the damp unease settling in Percival Archibald Finch's bones. He adjusted his tie, a paisley abomination his mother insisted was "festive," and pushed open the heavy oak door of the Forsythe Mansion. The hinges groaned in protest, a sound that echoed Percival's internal monologue. He hated estate inspections. Particularly those involving estates that hadn't seen sunlight, let alone a proper cleaning, since the Taft administration.

The receptionist, a brittle woman with a face that looked permanently pinched by lemon juice, eyed him with undisguised suspicion. "Percival Finch, Finch & Sons Insurance. I have an appointment with Mr. Forsythe regarding the renewal of his homeowner's policy."

She consulted a massive, leather-bound ledger, her finger tracing a seemingly endless list. "Forsythe... Forsythe... Ah, yes. Mr. Forsythe will see you in the west wing study. Third door on the left. But I must warn you," she added, lowering her voice to a conspiratorial whisper, "he's not been himself lately. Spends most of his time muttering to the portraits."

Percival swallowed hard. Mutering to portraits? Just what kind of claim was he signing up for today? He pasted on his most reassuring, "everything's going to be alright" smile and forced himself to advance further into the echoing gloom of Forsythe Mansion.

## Setting:

Forsythe Mansion looms on the crest of a windswept hill overlooking the sleepy town of Oakhaven, Massachusetts. Built in the late 19th century by Silas Forsythe, a shipping magnate with a penchant for the gothic, it's a sprawling, three-story edifice of grey stone, punctuated by turrets and gargoyles that seem to sneer at the perpetually overcast sky.

Inside, the mansion is a testament to faded grandeur. Dust motes dance in the scant light that penetrates the heavy velvet drapes, illuminating cobwebs that cling like macabre lace to the ornate chandeliers. Portraits of stern-faced Forsythe ancestors line the walls, their eyes seeming to follow visitors with unnerving intensity. The air hangs heavy with the scent of mildew, old paper, and something else... something subtly unsettling that Percival can't quite place. He knows, instinctively, that he's not alone in this cavernous space, and that the ghosts of Forsythe past are more than just historical figures hanging on the wall.
