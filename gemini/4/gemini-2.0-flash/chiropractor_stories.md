Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a chiropractor:

**Setting:**

The late afternoon sun, already tinged with the orange hues of October, streamed through the oversized windows of "Align Chiropractic & Wellness." Located in the heart of the bustling, but still charming, town of Willow Creek, nestled in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia, the office felt more like a cozy cottage than a medical facility. Exposed brick walls, softened by overflowing bookshelves and comfortable armchairs, created a welcoming atmosphere. The air, usually thick with the scent of eucalyptus and lavender, today held a subtle note of pumpkin spice â€“ a little autumnal cheer courtesy of the air freshener perched discreetly on a shelf behind the reception desk. The soft hum of a dehumidifier fought a losing battle against the lingering dampness of the recent rain.

**Story Opening:**

Dr. Evelyn Grace Hawthorne sighed, rubbing the bridge of her nose with a weary hand. The last patient of the day, Mrs. Gable, had just left, her posture straighter and her disposition significantly improved. But even the satisfaction of easing another's pain couldn't quite shake the nagging feeling that had been dogging Evelyn all week. Willow Creek, normally a haven of tranquility, was humming with an undercurrent of unease. Whispers of strange occurrences in the woods, unsettling animal behavior, and even stranger disappearances were circulating through the town like a virus. Evelyn, a pragmatic woman of science, usually dismissed such things as small-town gossip fueled by boredom. However, a shiver traced its way down her spine as she remembered the eerie, almost silent, flight of crows she'd witnessed this morning, a sight that felt profoundly *wrong*. She glanced at the antique grandfather clock in the corner. Five o'clock. Time to lock up and head home, even if "home" felt a little less comforting than usual tonight. As she reached for her purse, a sharp rap echoed through the waiting room. An unexpected late arrival. Evelyn steeled herself, hoping it wasn't another back injury exacerbated by the annual pumpkin carving contest at the town square.
