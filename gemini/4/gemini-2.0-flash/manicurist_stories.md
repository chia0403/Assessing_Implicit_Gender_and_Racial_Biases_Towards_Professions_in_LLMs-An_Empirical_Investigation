## Story Opening:

The scent of acetone hung thick in the air, a sharp, almost antiseptic aroma that Priscilla Mae Dubois barely even noticed anymore. It was as much a part of her as the callus on her right middle finger from pressing cuticles and the crick in her neck from bending over hands all day. Outside, the wind howled a November dirge, rattling the ill-fitting windows of "Polished Perfection," the nail salon she'd stubbornly clung to for the past ten years. But inside, nestled in her plush, faux-leopard-skin pedicure chair, Mrs. Ethelbert Bumble was regaling Priscilla with a tale of her prize-winning pumpkin pie.

"And I tell you, Priscilla Mae, the secret is the cinnamon! Not too much, mind you, but just a whisper, a suggestion of warmth..." Mrs. Bumble paused, her eyes gleaming with competitive fervor. "Shirley Plumpkin, she loads it up! You can practically taste the bark. She's going down this year, mark my words."

Priscilla Mae, a woman whose own life was more chipped enamel than gleaming gel manicure, smiled politely and nodded, smoothing a layer of blood-red polish onto Mrs. Bumble's already-perfectly-lacquered toenails. "I'm sure your pie is delicious, Mrs. Bumble."

But beneath the surface of Priscilla Mae's placid expression, a storm was brewing. The wind wasn't the only thing howling that morning. Inside her chest, a restlessness she couldn't quite name was clawing to get out, a desperate urge for something more, something... different. And that 'something' had taken the form of a flyer she'd seen taped to the community board at the Piggly Wiggly: "Auditions for 'Death By Disco,' A Murder Mystery Dinner Theatre!"

## Setting:

**Polished Perfection** is a small, slightly rundown nail salon located in the sleepy, unassuming town of Havenwood, Wisconsin. Its storefront is painted a lurid shade of bubblegum pink that Priscilla Mae inherited from the previous owner and has never had the heart (or the budget) to change. Inside, the decor is a chaotic mix of Priscilla Mae's personal taste and remnants of past owners. There's a zebra-striped waiting area couch, framed posters of various nail art trends from the early 2000s, and a constantly flickering neon sign that proudly proclaims "NAILS! NAILS! NAILS!"

The salon is divided into two main areas: the manicure stations, arranged along one wall with individual work lamps and colorful displays of nail polish, and the pedicure area, dominated by two plush, faux-leopard-skin chairs positioned in front of a small, outdated television. Despite its dated appearance and slightly overwhelming aesthetic, Polished Perfection is a local institution, a place where the women of Havenwood gather to gossip, commiserate, and leave with freshly painted nails that, for a brief moment, make them feel just a little bit more glamorous.
