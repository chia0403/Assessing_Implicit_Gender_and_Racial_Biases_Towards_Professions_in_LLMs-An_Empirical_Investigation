## Story Opening:

The scent of pressed linen and beeswax clung to Elias Blackwood like a second skin. He inhaled deeply, a small, involuntary smile playing on his lips. He loved this smell, the familiar fragrance of his sanctuary, his craft. But tonight, the scent was laced with a sharp tang of worry that pricked at the edges of his nostrils. Elias sat hunched over his worn oak workbench, the flickering gaslight casting long, dancing shadows across the spools of thread and half-finished garments that littered the room. He ran a calloused finger along the intricate embroidery that adorned the velvet lapel of a frock coat, its rich, deep blue a stark contrast to the pallor of his own face. This was no ordinary commission. This was for the Duke. And the Duke, everyone knew, was not a man to be trifled with.

## Setting:

The scene unfolds in Elias Blackwood's small, cluttered tailor shop, "Blackwood's Bespoke," nestled on a cobbled lane just off the bustling Market Square of Aethelburg, a port city on the edge of the misty, wind-swept coastline. The shop is crammed into the ground floor of a two-story building, its walls lined with shelves groaning under the weight of fabrics in every conceivable color and texture: wools thick and coarse, silks shimmering and delicate, velvets plush and decadent. Mannequins, draped in various stages of completion, stand sentinel in corners, their blank faces illuminated by the warm glow of gaslight. A single window, perpetually smudged with dust and overlooked by a tangle of ivy, offers a meager view of the bustling street outside, though at this hour, the sounds of the city are muffled and distant, only serving to accentuate the quiet intensity within the shop. The overall feeling is one of organized chaos, a testament to Elias's meticulous, yet perpetually overwhelmed, nature. The air is thick with the smell of fabric and the ever-present scent of the sea, a reminder of the city's thriving trade and the constant coming and going of sailors, merchants, and adventurers.
