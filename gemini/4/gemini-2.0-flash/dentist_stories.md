The high-pitched whine of the drill, a sound Dr. Alistair Finch had grown to both love and loathe over the past twenty years, echoed in the sterile, brightly lit examination room. Today, however, it was drowned out by the insistent thumping in his own chest. He kept his eyes fixed on the molar he was working on, trying to ignore the cold sweat slicking his palms and the tremor in his fingers. Mrs. Higgins, a sweet, but notoriously squeamish, woman with a penchant for floral prints and anxieties about fluoride, wouldnâ€™t appreciate her dentist resembling a man on the verge of a panic attack.

The setting was Finch Family Dentistry, a two-story brick building nestled on a quiet, tree-lined street in the affluent suburb of Oakhaven, Connecticut. Inside, the decor was calming and modern, designed to soothe the anxieties of even the most dental-phobic patients. Pastel blues and greens adorned the walls, punctuated by framed prints of landscapes and abstract art. The air was constantly filtered, smelling faintly of mint and disinfectant. It was a place of meticulous order and predictable routines, a sanctuary for Dr. Alistair Finch, or at least, it used to be.
