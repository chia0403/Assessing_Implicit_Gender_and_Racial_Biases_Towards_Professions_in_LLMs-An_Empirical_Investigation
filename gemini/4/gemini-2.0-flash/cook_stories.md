Okay, here's a story opening with setting and a main character who's a cook:

**Story Opening & Setting:**

The air hung thick and fragrant with the ghosts of last night's spices – cardamom, cumin, a whisper of clove still clinging to the copper pots.  Eleanor Abigail Davies, better known as Ellie to everyone this side of the Severn, inhaled deeply, a familiar comfort settling over her. The pre-dawn chill seeped through the gaps in the ancient stone walls of the kitchen, a permanent resident of The Black Swan Inn.  Beyond the small, diamond-paned window, the fishing village of Aberystwyth was still shrouded in a deep, blue slumber.  Only the faint scent of salt from the Irish Sea hinted at the bustle that would soon erupt as the fishing boats returned with their daily haul. Ellie, however, was already at work.

A stack of rough-hewn chopping boards, each bearing the scars of countless meals prepared, sat waiting on the sturdy oak table. The first batch of dough for the day's bara brith was already rising in a warm corner, its sweet, yeasty aroma fighting a losing battle with the lingering spice.  Ellie’s task for the morning was not, however, the traditional Welsh bread. No, today was special. Today, Lord Ashton, the rather pompous and extraordinarily picky owner of the Inn, had requested a Bouillabaisse.  A task Ellie loathed, but a Lord's wish, it seemed, was her command.

A sigh escaped her lips, ghosting in the cool air. Bouillabaisse. French frippery in a Welsh fishing village. It was culinary sacrilege, or at least, Ellie felt it was.
