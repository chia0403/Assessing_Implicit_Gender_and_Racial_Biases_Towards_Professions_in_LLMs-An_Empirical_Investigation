Okay, here's a story opening, including the setting and our tour guide's name:

**Story Opening:**

The humid air hung thick and heavy, tasting of salt and something indefinably ancient. A chorus of cicadas buzzed a relentless rhythm, punctuated by the raucous squawks of unseen birds hidden deep within the emerald canopy. Sweat beaded on Evangeline “Eva” Moreau's forehead, plastering strands of her dark, curly hair to her skin. She tugged at the collar of her linen shirt, a futile attempt to find some relief from the oppressive heat, and smiled, a practiced, welcoming smile that didn't quite reach her weary eyes.

"Welcome, everyone, to the Lost City of Z!" she announced, her voice amplified by a small, portable microphone. "My name is Evangeline Moreau, and I'll be your guide today as we delve into the mysteries of this forgotten civilization."

**Setting:**

The setting is the *Amazon rainforest in Brazil*, specifically the ruins of a recently rediscovered (fictional) ancient city, dubbed the "Lost City of Z" by the media and researchers. The city is partially overgrown, with massive stone structures jutting out from beneath thick vegetation. Archaeological teams have begun excavations, but much of the city remains shrouded in jungle, holding its secrets close. The time is present day. The tour group is standing at the entrance to a large, crumbling pyramid, the first stop on their guided exploration.
