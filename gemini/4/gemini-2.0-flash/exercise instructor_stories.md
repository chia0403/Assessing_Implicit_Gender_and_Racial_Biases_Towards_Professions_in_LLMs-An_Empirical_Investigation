The stale smell of disinfectant and sweat, usually invigorating to Isolde “Izzy” Rasmussen, hung heavy in the air that morning. Sunlight, usually a welcome visitor, was unwelcome, highlighting the dust motes dancing in the beams that pierced the gloom of the "Flex & Flow Fitness Centre" in downtown Minneapolis. Izzy, whose perpetually sunny disposition had been swallowed whole by a monstrous case of the Mondays, sighed and rubbed at the permanent crease between her eyebrows. At 6:15 AM, the only sounds were the low hum of the building's ventilation system and the rhythmic thump of Izzy’s foot as she tapped impatiently against the linoleum floor of Studio B. Her Power Pump class was scheduled to start in fifteen minutes, and so far, only Mrs. Higgins, bless her heart, was present, diligently wiping down her usual station with a damp cloth. Something felt…off. Not just the Monday funk, but a deeper, more unsettling premonition. Izzy, known for her boundless energy and infectious enthusiasm, found herself suddenly, inexplicably, drained.
