The scent of clary sage hung heavy in the air, a thick, grounding balm against the anxieties that seemed to cling to Dr. Moreau Wellness Center like cobwebs. Elara Seraphina Reyes inhaled deeply, letting the fragrance settle her before her next client arrived. Sunlight streamed through the frosted windows, dappling the floor in a mosaic of soft light and shadow. The room, one of six treatment rooms in the Wellness Center, was deliberately minimalist: smooth, cool grey walls, a single, tastefully abstract painting depicting swirling blues and greens, and, of course, the focal point - a plush, heated massage table draped in crisp, white linens. Elara smoothed a wrinkle she couldn't actually see, her fingers twitching with nervous anticipation. Dr. Moreau, bless his well-meaning but often misguided soul, had booked her solid all afternoon with "high-profile" clients. This was her chance, he'd emphasized, to truly shine and prove her value to the prestigious practice. But all Elara felt was the familiar tremor of self-doubt. What if her hands weren't strong enough? What if she couldn't pinpoint that nagging knot in their shoulder? What if, God forbid, she said the wrong thing and offended them? A delicate chime echoed from the reception area, announcing the arrival of her next appointment. Elara straightened, pasted on her most serene smile, and took a deep breath. Showtime.
