The scent of stale Cheerios and lavender hand sanitizer hung in the air, clinging to everything in the Sunshine Sprouts Daycare like a well-loved, if slightly sticky, blanket. Rain lashed against the large, windowless wall separating the "Caterpillars" room from the rest of the building, a relentless rhythm that threatened to drown out the cacophony of twenty-two two-year-olds discovering the joys (and dangers) of finger painting.

Amidst the miniature chaos, Elara Josephine Finch, a woman whose inherent kindness shone brighter than any classroom rainbow, knelt on the linoleum floor. She wore a splattered smock bearing the evidence of countless art projects gone awry, and a gentle smile softened the weariness etched around her hazel eyes. Elara was attempting to coax little Timmy, a perpetually anxious boy with a penchant for chewing on his shirt sleeves, into dipping his hands into the vibrant blue paint. "Just one little touch, Timmy?" she coaxed, her voice a soothing melody against the storm raging outside and the equally tempestuous storm raging within the Caterpillars room. This, she reminded herself for the hundredth time that morning, was her sanctuary. This was her purpose. This was her Tuesday.
