**Setting:**

The fluorescent lights of "Tax Time Titans," a budget-friendly tax preparation chain in suburban Minneapolis, hummed with a weary, relentless energy. It was mid-March, the air thick with the scent of cheap coffee, regret, and the faint, persistent odor of desperation. Posters featuring cartoon eagles declaring "Refunds Guaranteed!" plastered the walls, overlooking a sea of plastic chairs filled with anxious clients clutching mountains of receipts.

The tension was palpable, a silent agreement between the employees and their clientele that this annual ritual was a necessary evil.

Amelia had been staring at tax forms for so long today that the numbers had begun to swim before her eyes, morphing into tiny, mocking gnomes. She glanced at the clock: 8:47 PM. Closing time was a distant, shimmering oasis in the desert of tax season, a promise she clung to with the fervor of a shipwrecked sailor sighting land. Just one moreâ€¦ maybe. She called out, her voice a little raspy from overuse. "Next!" A burly man in a Vikings jersey lumbered towards her, looking like he'd rather be anywhere else on Earth. Amelia braced herself. The final stretch had begun.
