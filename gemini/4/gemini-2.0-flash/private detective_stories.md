The rain was a relentless percussion against the corrugated iron roof of my office, a soundtrack to the day's grim mood. It had been coming down in sheets for three straight days, turning the streets of Port Redemption into a murky, reflective swamp. The neon sign outside, blinking 'DETECTIVE' weakly through the downpour, felt like a desperate plea for something, anything, to break the monotony.

My office itself was a testament to a life lived on the fringes. Cigarette smoke had stained the paint a sickly yellow, competing with the peeling wallpaper depicting a faded palm tree scene â€“ a cruel joke considering the relentless grey outside. The only furniture was a chipped mahogany desk, salvaged from some defunct shipping company, and two mismatched chairs. One was threadbare velvet, sinking precariously with every sit, the other a rigid metal monstrosity that screamed 'orthopedic nightmare'.

I took a long drag from my cigarette, the cherry glowing bright in the dim light, and swiveled my chair to face the window. From here, I could just make out the murky harbour, choked with mist and the ghostly silhouettes of anchored freighters. Port Redemption. A city built on secrets, swallowed by the sea and drenched in despair. The perfect breeding ground for trouble, and therefore, for me.

My name is Detective Silas Thorne, and this, as they say, is my story.
