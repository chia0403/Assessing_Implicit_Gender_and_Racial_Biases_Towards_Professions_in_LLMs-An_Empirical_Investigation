The flickering fluorescent lights of Gate C-42 hummed a discordant tune as Amelia Rose Hartigan checked her reflection in the smudged glass. The pre-dawn light bled weakly through the airport windows, painting the scene in shades of gray, mirroring Ameliaâ€™s current mood. She tugged at the crisp, navy-blue scarf tied neatly around her neck, the airline logo, a stylized soaring falcon, barely visible in the dimness. 

The setting was Denver International Airport, a place that both exhilarated and exhausted her. DIA was a behemoth of concrete and glass, a swirling vortex of humanity constantly in motion. Today, it was eerily still, the calm before the inevitable storm of departing flights. Amelia knew that in a few short hours, this gate, like so many others, would be teeming with bleary-eyed travelers, anxious families, and stressed-out business executives, all eager to escape the ground and soar through the vast expanse of the sky. 

She sighed, pulling out her worn copy of "One Hundred Years of Solitude." Flying to Buenos Aires wasn't exactly a hardship, but after three back-to-back red-eyes, Amelia felt less like a graceful flight attendant and more like a well-dressed zombie. Still, she took a deep breath, reminding herself of the magic she felt the first time she saw an airplane take flight, the freedom that came with leaving the earth behind. Today, she would bring that magic to her passengers, even if she had to fake it until she made it.
