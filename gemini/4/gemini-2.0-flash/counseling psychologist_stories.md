## Story Opening:

The scent of jasmine and impending doom hung heavy in the air of Dr. Eleanor Abigail Vance's office. Outside, the afternoon sun beat down on Pasadena, California, turning the world into a shimmering, vaguely unsettling mirage. Inside, Eleanor felt that same shimmering unease settle in her stomach as she shuffled the papers on her desk. It wasn't the usual end-of-day exhaustion that followed a string of back-to-back sessions. This was something… different. 

The feeling had started earlier that morning, a subtle prickling on the back of her neck as she poured her first cup of Earl Grey. She’d dismissed it then, attributing it to the overactive imagination that came with the territory of being a counseling psychologist, listening to the innermost anxieties and darkest secrets of her patients day in and day out. But the feeling had only intensified, coalescing now into a full-blown premonition. 

The appointment book lying open on her desk offered no clues. Mrs. Higgins, struggling with the loss of her terrier. Daniel, working through his performance anxiety before his cello recital. Sarah, attempting to navigate the choppy waters of a new relationship. Just the usual suspects. And yet…

The insistent hum of the fluorescent lights seemed louder than usual, and the chipped paint on the floral wallpaper appeared to be actively mocking her. Eleanor took a deep breath, consciously trying to center herself. She was a professional. She dealt with anxieties, both her own and others, for a living. Whatever this was, she could handle it.

Just then, a sharp rap on the door shattered the fragile calm. "Come in," Eleanor said, her voice sounding far steadier than she felt.

## Setting:

Dr. Eleanor Abigail Vance's office occupied the second floor of a converted Victorian house on El Molino Avenue in Pasadena. The house, painted a cheerful daffodil yellow, was shared by several other therapists and a homeopathic doctor, fostering a strange, almost cozy sense of communal anxiety.

Eleanor's office itself was a carefully curated sanctuary of muted colors and calming textures. The walls were a soft sage green, adorned with prints of vintage botanical illustrations and abstract watercolors. A plush, Persian rug covered the worn wooden floor, softening the acoustics and adding a touch of bohemian warmth. The centerpiece of the room was a comfortable, oversized armchair upholstered in a calming shade of blue, strategically positioned to face Eleanor's desk.

Her desk, a sturdy oak antique, was usually piled high with paperwork, journals, and the occasional half-eaten granola bar. Today, however, it was unusually tidy, a sign of Eleanor's own internal struggle to maintain control in the face of the unsettling feeling that had been brewing all day. A small fountain, gurgling gently in the corner, was meant to provide a soothing white noise, but at the moment, it only seemed to amplify the silence, highlighting the palpable tension that filled the room. The overall effect was one of deliberate tranquility, a fragile illusion designed to soothe both Eleanor and her patients, an illusion that, at this particular moment, was threatening to crumble.
