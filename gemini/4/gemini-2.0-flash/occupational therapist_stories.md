## Story Opening:

The smell of antiseptic and burnt coffee hung heavy in the air, clinging to the faded posters of proper lifting techniques and simplified spinal cord diagrams. Elara Jane Hawthorne, occupational therapist extraordinaire (at least, according to her slightly delusional mother), adjusted the Velcro strap on a splint, her brow furrowed in concentration. Outside, the Seattle rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of the Evergreen Rehabilitation Center, a steady, depressing rhythm that mirrored the ache in her own shoulders. Mrs. Petrakis, a sweet but stubbornly immobile woman recovering from a stroke, was her first patient of the day. Elara took a deep breath, plastered on a smile, and adjusted the angle of her brightly coloured therapy putty. Today, they were sculpting a snowman, and Elara was determined, rain or no rain, to inject a little bit of cheer into Mrs. Petrakisâ€™s dreary winter. But as she reached for the woman's unresponsive hand, a flicker on the muted television screen in the corner caught her eye. A news report, a grainy image, a name that stopped her breath cold: Hawthorne.
