The chipped porcelain flamingo on Mrs. Henderson's lawn stared blankly ahead, a silent witness to the unfolding drama. Rain, the kind that soaked you through in seconds, lashed against the yellow crime scene tape that cordoned off the otherwise pristine Tudor house.  Amelia Grace Holloway, her sensible heels sinking slightly into the mud of the manicured lawn, shivered and adjusted the collar of her trench coat. She wasn't a fan of crime scenes, especially not ones that involved her clients.  This, however, was different. Mrs. Henderson wasn't just a client; she was Amelia's largest policyholder, and the burnt wreckage of what was once a vintage Rolls-Royce in the driveway suggested this wasn’t going to be a simple claim.  The air hung heavy with the smell of charred metal and petrichor, a stark contrast to the usual potpourri-scented air that permeated Mrs. Henderson’s home. Oakhaven, Connecticut, a town usually known for its quaint charm and antique shops, had taken a decidedly macabre turn.
