Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Amelia Vance's forty-second-floor office, blurring the already fading lights of downtown Chicago.  The wind howled a mournful tune, a stark counterpoint to the sterile hum of the air conditioning.  Amelia Vance, Chief Operating Officer of Vance International, a sprawling conglomerate built on her grandfather's legacy, tapped a manicured nail against the cool glass.  Her reflection stared back, a sharp image of controlled power: sleek dark hair pulled back in a tight bun, a tailored midnight-blue suit, and eyes that, despite the late hour, held a flicker of restless energy.  The city spread out beneath her like a glittering, rain-soaked circuit board, each light representing a life, a story, a transaction â€“ most of which, in some way, connected back to the Vance empire.  Tonight, however, those lights seemed less like symbols of power and more like beacons of a storm she couldn't quite predict. The antique clock on her desk chimed eleven times, a sharp reminder that another day, and another battle, was drawing to a close, only to give way to another.
