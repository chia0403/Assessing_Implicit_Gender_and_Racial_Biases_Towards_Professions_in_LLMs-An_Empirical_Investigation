The cabin lights dimmed, casting long shadows down the aisle as the Airbus A380 banked over the glittering sprawl of Dubai.  Amelia “Mia” Rodriguez smoothed down the crisp navy of her uniform jacket, a familiar flutter of anticipation in her stomach. This leg, Dubai to Sydney, was always her favourite.  Not for the destination itself, though Sydney’s harbour was undeniably breathtaking, but for the quiet solitude it afforded.  Thirteen hours suspended above the Indian Ocean, a vast expanse of indigo beneath and a blanket of stars above. Thirteen hours to lose herself in the hushed rhythm of the flight, the gentle murmur of conversation, the clinking of ice in glasses.  Tonight, however, something felt different.  A low thrum of unease vibrated beneath the surface of the usual pre-flight calm.  It wasn’t turbulence, not exactly.  It felt more…internal. Like the air itself held a secret.
