Rain lashed against the large front window, blurring the neon glow of the "Open" sign and painting the street outside in a shimmering, greasy monochrome. The small salon, nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed-down Italian restaurant in the heart of Foggy Bottom, Washington D.C., usually hummed with the low thrum of hair dryers and the gentle rasp of nail files.
