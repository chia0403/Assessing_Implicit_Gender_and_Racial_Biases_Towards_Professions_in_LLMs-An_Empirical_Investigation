The salt-laced wind whipped Amelia “Milly” Reyes’s charcoal-smudged hair across her face as she perched precariously on the jagged cliffs overlooking the churning Irish Sea. Below, the tiny fishing village of Portree, County Donegal, huddled against the emerald slopes like a flock of grey sheep.  Slate roofs, slick with rain, gleamed under the bruised, late afternoon sky.  Milly shifted on the damp grass, her worn leather satchel digging into her hip. Inside, nestled amongst crumpled tubes of oil paint and brittle charcoal sticks, lay the reason she’d braved the biting wind and the treacherous climb: a pristine, untouched canvas, waiting to capture the raw, untamed beauty of the Irish coast.  For Milly, Portree wasn’t just a picturesque postcard destination; it was a sanctuary, a place where the ghosts of her past held less sway and the whispers of her artistic muse echoed loudest.
