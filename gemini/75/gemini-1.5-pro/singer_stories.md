The crimson velvet curtains of the Orpheum Theatre in New Orleans hung heavy, thick with the dust of forgotten vaudeville acts and the lingering scent of stale beer.  A single bare bulb buzzed above Esme Evangeline Moreau, its feeble light casting long, skeletal shadows across the empty seats. Esme, perched precariously on a rickety stool center stage, clutched a tarnished silver microphone like a lifeline.  Her emerald green eyes, usually sparkling with mischief, were clouded with a melancholic haze as she stared out at the echoing emptiness. Outside, a humid August night throbbed with the pulse of jazz spilling from Bourbon Street, a stark contrast to the tomb-like silence within the once-grand theatre that Esme now called home. The Orpheum, a relic of a bygone era, mirrored Esme's own fading fortunes, both clinging to the tattered edges of a dream.
