The relentless Wyoming wind howled a mournful ballad around Dr. Amelia Grace Holloway as she wrestled the heavy oak door of her clinic closed.  The late November sun had already dipped below the jagged peaks of the Absaroka Range, painting the snow-dusted valley in hues of bruised purple and icy grey.  The sign above the door, “Holloway Veterinary Clinic and Animal Sanctuary,” creaked rhythmically in the wind, its hand-painted letters faded but still legible.  Located miles from the nearest town, the clinic was Amelia’s haven, a ramshackle collection of buildings huddled against the elements, populated by a menagerie of rescued animals and the quiet hum of her dedicated work.  Inside, the comforting scent of hay and antiseptic mingled with the faint, ever-present aroma of coffee, a constant companion in Amelia’s long and often solitary days.  Tonight, however, the usual peace was shattered. A frantic knocking echoed through the stillness, followed by a desperate cry, “Doc Holloway! Please, help me!”
