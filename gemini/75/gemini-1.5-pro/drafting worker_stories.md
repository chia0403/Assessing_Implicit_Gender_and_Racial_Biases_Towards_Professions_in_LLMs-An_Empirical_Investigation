The half-empty office, usually bustling with activity, felt strangely hushed this Friday afternoon. Most of the other drafters had already clocked out, eager to kick off the weekend.  But Elias, with a stack of revisions piled beside his elbow and a deadline looming, was chained to his desk.  He took a swig of lukewarm coffee, the bitter taste mirroring the growing unease in his gut. Something felt… off.
