Elias, sweat plastering his dark hair to his forehead, adjusted the sign that warned of lane closures ahead.  Dust devils danced across the cracked earth of the Nebraska panhandle, whirling tumbleweeds and grit across the deserted access road.  Thirty miles to the nearest town, population 483, Elias felt more like a lonely sentinel than a highway worker. The wind whispered through the dry grasses, a mournful sigh in the vast emptiness.  This stretch of I-80, notorious for its monotony and brutal summers, had seen its share of accidents, disappearances, and strange occurrences whispered about in hushed tones by the long-haul truckers. Today, the air hung heavy with a different kind of silence, a stillness that prickled the back of Elias’s neck.  Something felt wrong.
