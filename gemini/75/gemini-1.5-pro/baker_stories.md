The aroma of cardamom and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the pre-dawn chill.  Eloise "Elsie" Beauregard, her flour-dusted apron clinging to her like a second skin, squinted at the monstrous sourdough starter bubbling away in its crock.  The Beauregard Boulangerie, nestled between a dusty antique shop and a perpetually overflowing laundromat on Sycamore Street, was Elsie's kingdom.  Its peeling paint and mismatched chairs spoke of years of wear and tear,  but the warmth radiating from the brick oven and the overflowing baskets of crusty baguettes and jewel-toned pastries hinted at the magic within.  This morning, however, a strange stillness settled over the usually bustling bakery. The delivery truck, due two hours ago, hadn't arrived, and the rhythmic thump of Elsie’s kneading was the only sound echoing through the otherwise empty space.  A knot of unease tightened in Elsie’s stomach, a feeling as unfamiliar as an unrisen loaf.
