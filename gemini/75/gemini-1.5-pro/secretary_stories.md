The rhythmic clatter of typewriter keys filled the cramped office, punctuated by the occasional *ding* of the carriage return.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight that managed to penetrate the grime on the window, illuminating the meticulously organized desk of Miss Esmeralda Penelope Higgins.

It was a sweltering July afternoon in 1947, and the air in the two-room office of the Henderson Detective Agency, located above a bowling alley and sandwiched between a Chinese laundry and a dimly lit pawn shop on Bleecker Street, was thick with the smell of stale cigarette smoke and cheap aftershave.  Esmeralda, however, remained unfazed by the oppressive heat and less-than-salubrious surroundings.  She was, after all, the linchpin of this slightly disreputable establishment, the calm amidst the chaotic storms of Mr. Henderson's investigations.  Little did she know, this particular Tuesday was about to usher in a storm unlike any she had weathered before.
