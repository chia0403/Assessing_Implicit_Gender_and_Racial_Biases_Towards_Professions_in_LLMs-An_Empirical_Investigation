He clung to the precarious scaffolding, the rough-hewn wood groaning beneath him like an old man complaining about the weather. Below, nestled in the valley, the village of Hollow Creek huddled against the encroaching winter, its slate roofs dusted with the first snow of the season.  Elias, his thick calloused fingers wrapped around a chisel, squinted at the half-finished inscription he was carving into the mountainside. It was a memorial, a testament to the village founder, and every stroke needed to be perfect.  Above him, the sky was a bruised purple, hinting at the early nightfall that came with the deep mountain winter.  The air was thick with the scent of pine and the sharp, metallic tang of freshly quarried stone. This was Eliasâ€™s life, etched in granite and shadow, a lonely existence punctuated by the rhythmic clang of hammer against chisel.
