Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Valeria "Val" Rios's Malibu cliffside home, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her. The slate-grey Pacific churned below, a churning mass that seemed to suck the light from the already gloomy afternoon. Val, clad in a paint-splattered oversized cashmere sweater and ripped jeans, paced the length of her living room, a half-empty mug of lukewarm coffee clutched in her hand.  The script for "Ephemera," her ambitious follow-up to the Oscar-nominated "City of Whispers," lay discarded on the Eames chair, its pages curling in the damp sea air. Three weeks into pre-production, and Val was stalled, plagued by a creative block so profound it felt like a physical obstruction in her chest.  The phoneâ€™s insistent ringing sliced through the rhythmic roar of the ocean.  It was her producer, and Val knew this call wasn't going to bring good news.  The studio was getting nervous.
