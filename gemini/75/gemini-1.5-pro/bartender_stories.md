Tonight, like most nights, the Rusty Mug held a handful of regulars: old Jimmy, nursing a lukewarm beer and staring into the middle distance; Mary Beth, the waitress, wiping down tables with a weary sigh; and Big Tony, whose hulking frame took up half a booth in the corner.  The only newcomer was a man in a trench coat, his face obscured by the shadows of his fedora, who sat hunched over a shot of whiskey, the silence around him as palpable as the humidity. Eleanor, with a sigh that only a bartender at the edge of the world could muster, placed a clean glass on the counter, ready for whatever the night – and this stranger – might bring.
