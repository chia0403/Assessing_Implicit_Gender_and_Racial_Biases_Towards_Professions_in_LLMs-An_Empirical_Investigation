The scent of sawdust and pine hung thick in the air, a comforting blanket against the biting November wind that howled around the eaves of Elias Finch's workshop.  Nestled at the edge of the whispering Blackwood Forest, a few miles outside the sleepy town of Oakhaven, the workshop was a haven of warmth and light.

Outside, the forest pressed close, its dark silhouette a stark contrast to the warm, inviting chaos within.
