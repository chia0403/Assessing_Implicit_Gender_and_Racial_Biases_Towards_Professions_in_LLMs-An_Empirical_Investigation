The biting November wind whipped Amelia Thistlewick's braid across her face as she surveyed the grounds of Eventide Manor. Frost crunched under her worn leather boots, and the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks clawed at the bruised twilight sky.

Only the tenacious winter roses, clinging to the wrought-iron fence with improbable defiance, offered a splash of crimson against the monochrome landscape.  A faint, mournful howl echoed from the sea, a sound Amelia had come to associate with the coming of winter, and, more unsettlingly, with the secrets that Eventide seemed determined to keep buried beneath its frozen soil.
