The flickering neon sign of the "Last Chance Motel" buzzed intermittently, casting a sickly green glow over Beatrice "Bea" Goldblum's battered Ford Pinto.  Dust devils danced across the cracked asphalt of the parking lot, swirling around discarded fast-food wrappers and the occasional tumbleweed.  Mohave, California, population 4,200 (and dwindling), baked under the relentless August sun. Bea, sweat plastering her floral blouse to her back, slammed the car door and adjusted the strap of her overflowing sample case.

She needed a shower, a stiff drink, and – if the universe was feeling generous – a sale that wasn't to a bewildered desert tortoise.  This dusty, sun-scorched town was her last stop before she could finally head home, and Bea was determined to make it count.
