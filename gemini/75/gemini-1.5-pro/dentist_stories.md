The biting wind whipped off Lake Erie, rattling the "Open" sign hanging precariously from the rusty bracket outside Dr. Elias Thorne's dental practice.  Snow, the gritty, grey kind that promised more to come, dusted the deserted streets of Ashport, Ohio.

A world which, Elias had a growing suspicion, was about to get a lot less silent.
