Salt spray, whipped into a frenzy by the gale, occasionally speckled the glass, blurring the already fading light of the late October afternoon.  A single bare bulb, hanging precariously from a rafter, cast long, dancing shadows across the cluttered space, illuminating stacks of books, overflowing filing cabinets, and a half-eaten bowl of lukewarm porridge abandoned hours ago in the throes of a particularly challenging edit.
