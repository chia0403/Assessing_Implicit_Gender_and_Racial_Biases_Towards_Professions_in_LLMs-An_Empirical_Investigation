The biting November wind whipped through the towering pines of the Bitterroot Mountains, carrying the scent of snow and sawdust.  Sunrise was still a distant promise, the sky a bruised purple canvas streaked with faint pink.  Frost crunched under the heavy boots of Jedediah "Jed" Blackwood as he trudged towards the logging camp, a plume of breath escaping his lips with each exhale.  Camp Nine, they called it â€“ a temporary scar hacked into the wilderness, a testament to man's relentless pursuit of timber.  It consisted of a cluster of rough-hewn cabins huddled around a mess hall, their windows glowing faintly like embers in the pre-dawn gloom.  A diesel generator grumbled nearby, its rhythmic chugging a counterpoint to the wind's mournful howl.  Jed pulled his thick wool cap lower, shielding his face from the cold, and adjusted the grip on his thermos.  Another day, another tree.  He could almost feel the vibration of the saw against his calloused hands.
