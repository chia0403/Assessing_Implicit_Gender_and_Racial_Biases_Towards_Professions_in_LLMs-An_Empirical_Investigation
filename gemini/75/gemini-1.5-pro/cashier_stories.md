The fluorescent lights of the Quick Stop hummed a monotonous B-flat, a counterpoint to the incessant beep of the scanner in Amelia Reyes's hand.  It was 2:17 AM, the deadest part of the night shift, in a town so small it didn't even have a name, just a blinking yellow light and a sign that read "Pop. 483."

Amelia, her name tag slightly askew on her faded blue uniform, chewed on the end of a pen, her gaze drifting towards the rain-streaked window. She'd seen tumbleweeds with more personality than the last three customers.  Tonight, even the chirping crickets seemed to be bored.
