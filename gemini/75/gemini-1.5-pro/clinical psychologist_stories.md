The rain hammered against the arched window of Dr. Eleanor Vance’s office, mimicking the frantic drumming in her chest.  Gargoyles perched on the eaves of the old Victorian building seemed to leer down at the cobbled streets of Grimsworth, a small, perpetually overcast town nestled deep in the Yorkshire Dales. Inside, the only light came from a flickering gas lamp on Eleanor’s heavy oak desk, casting long, dancing shadows that twisted the ornate carvings into grotesque faces. It was late, well past ten, and the last vestiges of daylight had long since bled from the sky, leaving behind a thick, suffocating darkness.  Eleanor, her dark hair pulled back in a severe bun, rubbed at the tension knotting between her shoulder blades, the scent of old books and woodsmoke heavy in the air.  She was reviewing her notes on her newest patient, a Mr. Silas Crowe, whose case was proving… unsettling, to say the least.
