The fluorescent lights of Mrs. Eleanor Vance's classroom hummed a monotonous tune, punctuated by the rhythmic *snip snip snip* of safety scissors wrestling with construction paper. Outside, the October wind howled a mournful ballad against the brick walls of Maplewood Elementary, scattering crimson and gold leaves across the playground. In the small town of Harmony Creek, nestled deep in the Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina, autumn had arrived in a blaze of glory, but inside Room 2B, the focus was firmly on creating the perfect Thanksgiving turkey handprint collage. Mrs. Vance, a woman whose smile lines mirrored the crinkles in her well-loved corduroy jacket, surveyed her flock of second-graders with a mixture of amusement and affection.  Glue sticks were wielded like magic wands, glitter rained down like fairy dust, and the air hung thick with the sweet scent of Elmer's and impending sugar crashes.  This was her world, a vibrant, chaotic, and utterly fulfilling microcosm of sticky fingers, boundless imagination, and the unwavering belief that anything was possible with enough construction paper and a good story.  But little did Mrs. Vance know, the approaching holiday season was about to bring more than just turkey crafts and pumpkin spice lattes to Harmony Creek. Something far more unsettling was brewing in the shadowed hollows of the surrounding mountains, something that would test the very fabric of their close-knit community.
