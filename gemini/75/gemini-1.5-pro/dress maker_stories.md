The clatter of horse-drawn carriages on cobblestones echoed through the tall windows of Mademoiselle Geneviève Dubois's atelier, a counterpoint to the rhythmic snip-snip of her shears.  It was a blustery November afternoon in 1888, and the gaslights, already lit against the early dusk, cast a warm glow on the rich fabrics draped across her work tables.  Geneviève’s atelier, nestled on a quiet side street just off the bustling Champs-Élysées in Paris, was a haven of silks, satins, and lace.  Swatches of every imaginable colour pinned to the walls created a kaleidoscope effect, reflecting the vibrant imagination of the woman who held a pin cushion strapped to her wrist like a warrior's shield.  Outside, the Parisian wind howled, hinting at the coming winter, but within the atelier, a comfortable warmth permeated the air, scented with the faint aroma of lavender and the slightly metallic tang of freshly sharpened needles.
