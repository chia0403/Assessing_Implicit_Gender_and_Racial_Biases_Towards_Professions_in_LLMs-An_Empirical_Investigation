The siren wailed, a mournful cry slicing through the thick, humid air of a New Orleans summer night. Rain lashed against the windshield of the ambulance, blurring the already hazy neon glow of Bourbon Street. Inside, Amelia “Amy” Dubois, Emergency Medical Technician, braced herself against the lurching vehicle as they navigated the narrow, pothole-ridden streets. Her partner, Marcus, wrestled with the steering wheel, his knuckles white against the worn leather. The dispatcher's voice crackled over the radio, a frantic blend of static and urgency: "Multiple victims, possible stabbing, outside the Blue Moon Saloon. Code 3, I repeat, Code 3."  Amy tightened the strap of her bag, the familiar knot of adrenaline forming in her stomach. It was going to be a long night.
