The fluorescent lights of Mrs. Eleanor Ainsworth's kindergarten classroom hummed a monotonous tune, punctuated by the rhythmic *thwack-thwack-thwack* of a rogue, glittery pom-pom repeatedly flung against the wall by a small boy named Leo.  Outside, the late October wind howled around the brick walls of Maplewood Elementary, rattling the paned windows overlooking the playground, where the swings swayed emptily in the grey afternoon light.  Rain lashed against the glass, transforming the world outside into a blurred watercolor painting. Inside, Mrs. Ainsworth, her auburn hair pulled back in a practical bun, knelt beside a teary-eyed Lily, patiently coaxing her to glue googly eyes onto a construction paper turkey.  The air was thick with the scent of Elmer's glue and impending sugar crashes â€“ the inevitable aftermath of Halloween cupcake decorating.
