The aroma of burnt sugar and coconut oil hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume that clung to the chipped turquoise walls of "Curl Up & Dye." Rain lashed against the large front window, blurring the neon "Open" sign and the reflection of Elara Juniper Bloom, proprietor and sole stylist.  Elara, a woman whose own hair defied gravity in a riot of fiery auburn curls, tapped a chipped cerulean nail against the worn counter. The salon, nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed fortune teller's shop in the sleepy coastal town of Port Blossom, Maine, was usually bustling on a Saturday afternoon.  But today, the only sound besides the drumming rain was the rhythmic tick-tock of the vintage Coca-Cola clock hanging above the faded floral wallpaper. Elara glanced at it â€“ 3:17 pm.  She sighed, a puff of air that stirred the stray strands of hair that had escaped her messy bun.  A slow, creeping dread began to unfurl in her stomach. This wasn't just a slow day; this was *unnaturally* slow.  Something was amiss in Port Blossom.
