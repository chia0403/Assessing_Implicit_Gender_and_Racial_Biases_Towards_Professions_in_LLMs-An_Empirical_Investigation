The opulent Grand Majestic Hotel, a monument to Gilded Age excess, breathed history.  Chandeliers dripped with crystals, reflecting the soft glow of gaslight onto polished marble floors. The air, thick with the scent of lilies and old money, hummed with the hushed whispers of the wealthy.  Outside, the November wind howled against the stained-glass windows, a stark contrast to the warmth within.  Inside,  eighteen-year-old Fitzwilliam "Fitz" Archibald Higgins III, his name a stark contrast to his station, adjusted the worn leather strap of his bellhop uniform.  His cap, slightly too large, perched precariously on his head as he nervously surveyed the lobby, waiting for the inevitable chime that signaled his next task. Tonight, the air held a particular electric charge, a sense of anticipation Fitz couldn’t quite place. It clung to the heavy velvet drapes and crackled in the fireplace, promising something – something momentous, perhaps, or perhaps just trouble.
