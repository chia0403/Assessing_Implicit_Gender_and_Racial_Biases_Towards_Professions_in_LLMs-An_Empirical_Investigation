The relentless Chicago wind, sharp and laced with the promise of snow, whipped Amelia “Millie” Cartwright’s dark hair across her face as she climbed the crumbling steps of the three-flat on West Division. Flakes of paint, the color of faded robin’s egg blue, clung to her wool coat like misplaced confetti.  It was late November, the kind of grey afternoon that swallowed sound and seemed to seep into your bones. Millie tucked a stray strand behind her ear, adjusted the worn leather satchel slung across her chest, and knocked on the peeling door of apartment 2B.  This was the third visit this week to see Darius Jones, a young man barely out of his teens with a rap sheet longer than Millie’s arm.  He was on probation for grand theft auto, and if the flickering porch light and the drawn blinds were anything to go by, he wasn’t exactly embracing the spirit of rehabilitation. The air hung heavy with the faint scent of stale cigarettes and something else, something Millie couldn't quite place, but that sent a shiver down her spine.
