The biting wind, sharp enough to hang frozen meat on, whipped down Lamplighter Lane, rattling the sign above Elias Thorne's shop. "Thorne's Fine Meats: Purveyor of Prime Cuts & Savoury Sausages" it proclaimed in faded gold lettering.  Elias, bundled in a thick wool coat over his bloodstained apron, watched the swirling snow from the warmth of his doorway.  Dusting Lamplighter Lane meant dusting the cobblestones of Port Blossom, a fishing town perched precariously on the edge of the Whispering Cliffs, where the sea gnawed at the rock like a hungry beast.  It was a harsh, unforgiving place, much like the cleaver Elias wielded with practiced ease. The air, usually thick with the smell of brine and fish guts, was today dominated by the richer, metallic scent of blood emanating from within the shop.  A fresh carcass, a hefty boar brought down by old Man Hemlock in the northern woods, hung from a meat hook, its tusks glinting in the single gas lamp that illuminated the sawdust-covered floor.  Today was Hog Butchering Day, and Elias had a lot of work to do.
