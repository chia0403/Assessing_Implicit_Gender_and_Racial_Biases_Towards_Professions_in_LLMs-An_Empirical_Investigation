The biting wind whipped across the cracked asphalt of O'Malley's Auto Repair, stinging Eliza Mae Higgins' cheeks despite the thick layer of grease smeared across them.  The November sky, the color of a bruised plum, threatened snow over the small town of Harmony Creek, nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Harmony Creek, population 842 (not counting the stray dogs Eliza sometimes fed), boasted a single gas station, a perpetually dusty general store, and Eliza's garage, where the scent of motor oil, rust, and WD-40 hung in the air like a permanent fog.  A rusty '57 Chevy pickup, its hood propped open like a gaping maw, sat center stage in the garage bay, its engine emitting a low, guttural groan that mirrored the one building up in Eliza's own stomach.  This wasn't just any engine trouble; this sounded like the death rattle of a particularly stubborn mule.  And Eliza, with her calloused hands and a heart as resilient as a well-worn tire iron, was the only one in Harmony Creek who could coax it back to life.
