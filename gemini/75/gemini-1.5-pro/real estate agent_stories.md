The crisp October air nipped at Amelia Grace Hawthorne's cheeks as she stood on the crumbling porch of the old Blackwood Manor.  Fallen leaves, the color of burnt oranges and bruised plums, swirled around her ankles.  Overlooking the desolate, weed-choked gardens and the rusting wrought-iron gates, she shivered, pulling her camel-hair coat tighter.  This was the fifth property she'd viewed this week, and by far the mostâ€¦challenging. Located miles outside the quaint town of Oakhaven, Blackwood Manor boasted a dubious history and an even more dubious asking price.  Amelia, however, was determined. This sprawling Victorian, despite its current state of disrepair, held an undeniable charm, a whisper of forgotten grandeur that she knew, with the right buyer, could translate into a breathtaking restoration project.  The problem wasn't the house itself; it was the unsettling quiet, the sense of being watched, and the persistent rumors that kept even the most intrepid of Oakhaven's residents away.
