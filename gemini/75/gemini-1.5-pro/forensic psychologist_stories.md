Rain lashed against the stained-glass window of Dr. Elias Thorne's office, the depiction of a benevolent saint now contorted into a grotesque grimace by the fractured light.  The gothic architecture of the old Victorian building, usually a source of somber charm, felt oppressive tonight.  Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, mirroring the turmoil brewing within Elias.  His fingers, long and slender, drummed a restless rhythm against the mahogany desk littered with case files.  Each tap echoed in the cavernous room, punctuated only by the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock in the corner, its pendulum swinging like a guillotine blade.  Elias, his brow furrowed in concentration, stared intently at the crime scene photos scattered before him â€“ a macabre tableau of a ritualistic murder in the heart of the otherwise peaceful Cotswolds village of Alderbury.  This wasn't London, where such darkness seemed to fester in the alleyways.  This was a place of quaint tea shops and rolling green hills, a place where evil was supposed to be a stranger.
