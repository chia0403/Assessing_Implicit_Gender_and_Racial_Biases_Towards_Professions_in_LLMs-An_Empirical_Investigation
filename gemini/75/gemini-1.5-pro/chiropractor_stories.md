The neon "Open" sign buzzed erratically, casting a sickly green glow across the rain-slicked asphalt of Elm Street. Inside, Dr. Elias Thorne, D.C., adjusted the thermostat for the third time in as many hours.  The damp chill of the late October evening had seeped into his small, single-story clinic, clinging to the worn examination tables and the anatomical charts that papered the walls.  Located on the quieter end of Elm, nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed antique shop, Thorne Chiropractic wasn’t exactly thriving.  The town of Havenwood, Oregon, was small, and most folks preferred the familiar crackle of old Doc Miller's bonesetting methods to Elias's more modern, evidence-based approach.  Tonight, however, Elias wasn't worried about attracting new patients. He was waiting for a specific one, a patient who’d promised to pay double his usual fee for a late-night appointment.  And Elias, with the clinic’s heating bill looming over him like a skeletal specter, needed that money.
