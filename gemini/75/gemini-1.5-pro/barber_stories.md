The flickering neon sign of "Finnian O'Malley's Tonsorial Parlour" cast a lurid, emerald glow onto the rain-slicked cobblestones of Grimsborough Lane.  Grimsborough itself, a town nestled deep in the Pennine hills of northern England, was a place where the fog clung to the moorlands like a shroud and secrets festered in the damp, stone houses. It was a town that had seen better days, a sentiment echoed in the chipped paint of Finnian's shopfront and the worn velvet of his barber's chair.  Inside, the air was thick with the scent of bay rum aftershave and the faint, metallic tang of fear.  Not the fear of a close shave, mind you, but a deeper, more unsettling dread that permeated the very fabric of Grimsborough. Tonight, as the wind howled like a banshee outside, Finnian O'Malley was about to receive a customer unlike any he had ever encountered before.
