The biting wind whipped at Amelia "Mia" Reyes's flight jacket as she prepped the Cessna Skyhawk for takeoff.  The desolate beauty of the Alaskan wilderness stretched out before her, a tapestry of snow-dusted spruce and frozen lakes under a sky the colour of bruised plums.  Knik Glacier, a jagged behemoth of ice and rock, loomed in the distance, its peaks kissed by the ethereal glow of the setting sun.  Mia adjusted her headset, the familiar crackle of static a comforting sound in the vast silence.  This was her office, her sanctuary, a place where the only rules were the laws of physics and her own finely honed instincts.  Today's flight was a routine mail run to the remote village of Hope, nestled at the foot of the Chugach Mountains, but in Alaska, routine was a relative term.  The weather could shift in an instant, turning a simple delivery into a fight for survival.  And Mia knew, deep down, that today was going to be anything but routine.
