The pungent aroma of perm solution hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume that Genevieve "Gen" Dubois barely registered anymore.  Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the cracked asphalt of the parking lot, illuminating the faded pink and green signage of "Curl Up & Dye," Gen's small salon nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed-down Chinese buffet in the sleepy town of Harmony Glade, Arizona. Inside, the air conditioner wheeled a mournful tune against the steady hum of the hairdryer aimed at Mrs. Henderson's freshly set rollers.  Gen, with a nametag depicting a cartoon pair of scissors and comb clipped to her teal smock, expertly maneuvered a thin comb through Mrs. Higgenbottom’s wispy grey strands, preparing for the weekly blue rinse ritual that was as predictable as the Arizona sunsets. This Tuesday, however, a black Cadillac Escalade, gleaming like a polished obsidian beetle, pulled up outside, disrupting the usual rhythm of Harmony Glade and signaling a change in Gen’s otherwise predictable life.
