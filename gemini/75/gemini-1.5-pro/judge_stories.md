The mahogany desk, polished to a mirror sheen, reflected the flickering gaslight back onto Judge Elias Thorne’s weary face.  Rain lashed against the tall, arched windows of his chambers, a relentless drumming that mirrored the headache pounding behind his temples.  Outside, the cobbled streets of New Birmingham, normally bustling with activity even at this late hour, were deserted, save for the occasional flickering lantern carried by a hurrying figure.  The year was 1888, and a thick fog, as pervasive as the unease gripping the city, clung to the narrow, gas-lit streets, obscuring the imposing gothic architecture and casting long, distorted shadows that danced like phantoms in the lamplight. The whispers had started a week ago, growing louder with each passing day – whispers of disappearances, of strange symbols chalked on doorways, and of a creature stalking the fog-shrouded alleyways. Judge Thorne, a man of logic and law, dismissed them as hysteria, the product of overactive imaginations fueled by the oppressive atmosphere.  But tonight, as he sat alone in his chambers, a single, blood-red rose lying on his blotter, a chilling certainty settled in his gut. This was no mere hysteria. Something dark had come to New Birmingham.
