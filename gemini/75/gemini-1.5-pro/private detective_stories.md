Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Amelia "Milly" Blackwood's office, mimicking the relentless drumming in her head.  Neon signs from the dive bar across the street reflected in the slick asphalt of Bleaker Street, painting lurid streaks across her cluttered desk.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and yesterday's anxieties, a familiar aroma in Milly's world.  1948 Hollywood was a town built on illusion, and the peeling wallpaper of her cramped office, tucked between a pawn shop and a Chinese laundry, was as honest a reflection of reality as you could find.  Milly, her trench coat still dripping, stared at the crumpled cigarette in her ashtray, a miniature version of the city's crumbling fa√ßade. The telephone, a hulking black beast, jangled, shattering the uneasy silence.  A case, she hoped.  Anything to break the monotony and the gnawing feeling that something big and bad was brewing beneath the gilded surface of this town.
