The flickering neon sign of the "Starlight Diner" buzzed intermittently, casting a sickly green glow across the rain-slicked asphalt of Route 66. Inside, amidst the vinyl booths and chrome countertops, the air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and frying onions.  Amelia Grace Hawthorne, a woman whose perpetually tired eyes belied a sharp wit and even sharper memory, wiped down a sticky table, the rhythmic squeak of the rag a counterpoint to the mournful wail of a Hank Williams song on the jukebox.  It was a Tuesday night in Harmony Creek, Arizona, a town smaller than Amelia's last paycheck and just about as desolate. The kind of place where secrets festered like mold in a damp basement and everyone knew everyone else's business, whether they wanted to or not.  Tonight, however, something felt different.  A black Cadillac, gleaming even in the downpour, had pulled up outside, a stark contrast to the usual beat-up pickups and rusty sedans.  And Amelia, with a knot of unease tightening in her stomach, knew that Harmony Creek was about to get a whole lot less harmonious.
