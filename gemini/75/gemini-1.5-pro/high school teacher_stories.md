The fluorescent lights of Mr. Elias Thorne's classroom hummed a monotonous B-flat, a counterpoint to the rhythmic tapping of October rain against the windowpanes.  Room 214 of Ashwood High, affectionately nicknamed the "Literary Lair" by Elias, was usually a vibrant space, plastered with student artwork and overflowing with the comforting scent of old books. Today, however, it felt subdued, mirroring the grey, overcast sky outside.  Half-empty coffee cups littered Elias's desk, testaments to a late night spent grading essays on Shakespeare's less-than-thrilling sonnets.  Ashwood, nestled in the heart of Vermont's Green Mountains, was typically ablaze with autumnal color this time of year, but the persistent rain had muted even the vibrant maples to a dull, watery orange. Elias, a man who found joy in the crisp air and crunch of fallen leaves, felt the damp chill seep into his bones, a premonition that this particular Monday was going to be anything but typical.
