## Story Opening:

The familiar hum of the fluorescent lights was a constant drone in Elias Thorne's ears, a buzzing counterpoint to the scratch of his mechanical pencil against the vellum. He paused, the graphite point hovering just above a meticulously drawn flange, and pinched the bridge of his nose. Another hour, maybe two, and he could escape the stale, recycled air of the drafting room. But right now, the blueprints for the new sewage treatment plant demanded his undivided attention. He sighed, a puff of air that stirred the stray curls escaping his perpetually rumpled hair. Tonight, Elias promised himself, he wouldn't succumb to the allure of lukewarm takeout and reruns. Tonight, he would finally start painting.

## Setting:

The story is set in the cramped, windowless drafting room of the **Evergreen Engineering and Construction** company in **Spokane, Washington, 1988**. The room, roughly the size of a large classroom, is a chaotic symphony of right angles and disorganization. Six drafting tables, stained with years of coffee rings and pencil shavings, are crammed together. Each table is littered with technical drawings, worn-out reference manuals, and various drafting tools - compasses, T-squares, triangles, and a collection of well-loved erasers. A half-finished cup of coffee sits precariously close to a blueprint on Elias' table. The walls are painted a pale, institutional green, peeling slightly at the corners. A large blueprint roll dispenser dominates one corner, while a clunky, beige computer sits humming in another, used only for the most basic calculations. The air smells faintly of ink, paper, and the faint, metallic tang of ozone from the photocopier down the hall. Outside, the late afternoon sun is beginning to dip below the Spokane River gorge, but inside Evergreen Engineering, time stands still, measured only by the rhythm of drafting pencils and the occasional grumble from Mr. Henderson, the perpetually irritable supervisor.
