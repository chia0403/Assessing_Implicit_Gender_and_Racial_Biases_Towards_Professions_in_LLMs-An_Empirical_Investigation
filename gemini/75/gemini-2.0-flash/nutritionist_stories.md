The aroma of freshly-baked sourdough, usually a siren song tempting even the most disciplined eater, did nothing for Dr. Eleanor Beatrice Vance. She barely registered it as she navigated the bustling Berkeley farmer's market, her eyes scanning the riot of colors vying for her attention. The early morning sun glinted off the vibrant red of heirloom tomatoes, the deep purple of eggplants piled high, and the cheerful yellow of corn still dewy with moisture. This was her weekly ritual, her sanctuary, the place where she could reconnect with the very source of her passion â€“ the power of food.

Eleanor, a woman whose meticulous attention to detail bordered on obsessive, wore a practical linen dress the color of unbleached cotton. A worn, leather-bound notebook peeked from the depths of her oversized tote bag, already half-filled with organic arugula and locally sourced honey. The air buzzed with the enthusiastic chatter of vendors hawking their wares, the cheerful bleating of distant goats, and the rhythmic thrum of a bluegrass band tuning up for their morning set. Berkeley, with its quirky charm and unwavering commitment to sustainable living, was the perfect backdrop for Eleanor's life and her mission: to help people rediscover the joy and vitality that came from nourishing their bodies with real, wholesome food. But even in this haven of health and well-being, Eleanor sensed a growing undercurrent of unease, a pervasive anxiety that threatened to undermine the very foundations of her work. And it all seemed to be stemming from one increasingly ubiquitous, brightly colored, and utterly terrifying word: *processed*.
