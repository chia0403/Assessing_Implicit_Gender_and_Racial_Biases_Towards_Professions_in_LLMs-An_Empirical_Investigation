The wind howled a mournful dirge across the Montana plains, whipping dust devils that danced like restless spirits across the dry, cracked earth. Elias Thorne, his face etched with the harsh lines of sun and wind, squinted against the glare. He ran a calloused hand over the brim of his worn Stetson, pushing it further down against the unrelenting gusts. The ranch house, a squat, sturdy building built from weathered wood and grit, seemed to huddle against the landscape for protection, a lone bastion of humanity against the indifferent vastness.

This was the Thorne Ranch, a spread of five thousand acres nestled on the edge of the Little Snowy Mountains. It wasn't much to look at, especially compared to the sprawling empires of some of the older families in the county, but it was Elias's lifeblood. He'd inherited it from his father, and his father before him, each generation carving a living from this unforgiving land, leaving their sweat and tears soaked into its parched soil.

Elias sighed, the sound lost to the wind. He'd seen harder times, that was certain. Droughts that turned the land to dust, blizzards that swallowed entire herds, and the constant, gnawing worry of debt that clung to him like a persistent shadow. But something felt different this time. A deep, unsettling unease, like the land itself was holding its breath, waiting for something terrible to break. He just didnâ€™t know what.
