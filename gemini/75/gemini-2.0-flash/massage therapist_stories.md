## Opening:

The first thing Imelda Rodriguez noticed was the scent. Not the lavender and eucalyptus she usually diffused, a calming balm against the anxieties she kneaded out of knotted shoulders, but something sharper, acrid. Like burnt sugar mixed with ozone. She frowned, her fingers hovering over the volume knob of the calming rainforest music she'd carefully selected for Mr. Henderson's deep tissue session. He was a man who held his stress in his lower back like a tightly wound spring, and any deviation from his routine could throw him off balance.

The smell was stronger near the window. Imelda peeked through the slats of the bamboo blinds, half expecting to see a faulty electrical wire sparking from the building next door. Instead, she saw nothing but swirling grey fog, thick enough to lick off her tongue. Impossible. It was a perfectly clear morning just minutes ago when she'd arrived. A chill ran down her spine that had nothing to do with the draft. This was no ordinary fog. This felt...wrong.

She glanced back at Mr. Henderson, prone on the table, face buried in the crescent-shaped headrest. He snored softly, blissfully unaware. He’d likely pay good money for a fog-induced deep relaxation technique, she thought wryly, but something told her this was beyond her skill set.

## Setting:

Imelda Rodriguez’s massage studio, “Serenity & Flow,” was located on the third floor of a brick building in the trendy arts district of Asbury Park, New Jersey. The space was small but meticulously decorated, a sanctuary of calm amidst the vibrant, sometimes chaotic energy of the town. Cream-colored walls were adorned with framed prints of swirling watercolors and photographs of peaceful beaches. Soft lighting filtered through gauzy curtains, illuminating shelves filled with essential oils, incense, and smooth river stones.

A small waiting area with plush armchairs and a bubbling water fountain greeted clients upon entry. The massage room itself held a professional massage table draped in soft flannel sheets, a heated towel cabinet humming quietly in the corner, and a sound system that could transport a stressed-out accountant to a secluded rainforest with the push of a button.

From the large window overlooking Cookman Avenue, Imelda usually had a clear view of the bustling shops and restaurants below. Today, however, the view was obscured by the unnatural fog, turning the vibrant street into a ghostly, unsettling landscape.
