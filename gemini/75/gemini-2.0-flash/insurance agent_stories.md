## Story Opening:

The rhythmic tap-tap-tapping of Agnes Beatrice Plumtree's fingers echoed in the cavernous silence of her office. Rain, fat and relentless, lashed against the bay windows overlooking the perpetually grey expanse of the Yorkshire Dales. Agnes didn't mind the rain, not really. It was good for the heather, she supposed, and it kept the tourists away. Tourists meant more paperwork, and Agnes, despite being the sole proprietor of Plumtree Protection Plans Insurance, was having a particularly slow Tuesday.

She hadn't even had a single phone call, not even from Mrs. Higgins down the lane, complaining about the badger that was surely, positively, going to undermine her garden wall. And that was saying something. Mrs. Higgins was more reliable than the morning post.

Agnes sighed, the sound like air escaping a punctured balloon. She adjusted her floral-print spectacles, perched precariously on the bridge of her nose, and squinted at the half-finished crossword in front of her. Seven down: "Apathy's Cousin" (8 letters). Lethargy. Of course. It described her entire afternoon.

Suddenly, the shrill ring of the phone pierced the quiet. Agnes practically jumped, scattering her collection of promotional pens across the desk. "Finally," she muttered, snatching up the receiver. "Plumtree Protection Plans, Agnes Beatrice Plumtree speaking, how may I protect you today?"

## Setting:

The office of Plumtree Protection Plans Insurance was located in a converted stable block on the outskirts of the small, picturesque village of Upper Dropping Bottom in North Yorkshire, England. The exterior, built from honey-colored stone, was charmingly rustic, with ivy crawling up the walls and window boxes overflowing with vibrant geraniums (courtesy of Mrs. Higgins). The interior, however, was a stark contrast.

Agnes, a woman of practicality rather than aesthetics, had furnished the space with functional, if somewhat mismatched, pieces. A large, oak desk dominated the room, cluttered with stacks of paperwork, policy brochures, and an overflowing ashtray (Agnes was trying to quit, again). Behind the desk sat a worn, faux-leather swivel chair that creaked ominously with every movement.

The walls, painted a rather depressing shade of beige, were adorned with framed certificates, insurance industry awards (mostly participation trophies), and a faded watercolor landscape depicting a particularly bleak section of the Yorkshire Moors. A large, mahogany bookcase housed a collection of insurance law textbooks, several dusty dictionaries, and a complete set of Agatha Christie novels.

A small, electric fireplace hummed quietly in the corner, doing little to combat the damp chill that permeated the old building. The only concession to personality was a small, framed photograph of Agnes and her beloved (and now sadly deceased) pug, Winston, grinning toothily at the camera.

The overall impression was one of quiet competence, slightly frayed around the edges, much like Agnes herself. A place where you could trust your insurance needs would be taken care of, even if the decor left something to be desired. A place where you could find reliable protection, even in the most unpredictable of circumstances.
