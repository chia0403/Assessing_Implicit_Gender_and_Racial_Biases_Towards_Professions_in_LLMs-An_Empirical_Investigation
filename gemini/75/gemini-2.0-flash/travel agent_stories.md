The fluorescent lights of "Sunshine Escapes" hummed a monotonous song, a stark contrast to the vibrant brochures plastered across every available surface. Isabella "Izzy" Ramirez tapped a crimson fingernail against the laminated cover of a brochure featuring a turquoise lagoon in Bora Bora. The air hung thick with the scent of cheap coffee and desperation, a familiar perfume after ten years navigating the often-stormy seas of the travel industry. It was a Tuesday, typically a slower day, but Izzy knew the quiet wouldn't last. Someone, somewhere, was always dreaming of escaping, and she was there to make those dreams (sometimes disastrously) come true. Outside, the November wind howled through the narrow streets of Oakhaven, a small, perpetually overcast town clinging to the coast of Oregon. The kind of place people usually tried to escape FROM, not to. Izzy sighed, the sound swallowed by the office's sterile hum. Maybe today would be the day she booked herself a one-way ticket out of here.
