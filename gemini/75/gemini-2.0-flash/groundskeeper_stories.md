**Story Opening:**

The aroma of damp earth and freshly cut grass was Eliza Bellweather's symphony, the soundtrack to her life. On this particular morning, however, a discordant note hung in the air â€“ a sharp, metallic tang that sat poorly with the sweet scent of honeysuckle blooming along the ancient stone wall. Eliza wrinkled her nose, tightening her grip on the handle of her antique lawnmower, a hand-me-down from her grandfather, who had also tended these grounds. The sun hadn't fully crested the rolling hills yet, leaving the gardens of Blackwood Manor bathed in a soft, ethereal light that only amplified the strangeness. Usually, only dew sparkled like diamonds on the meticulously manicured lawns. Today, something else glittered, catching the early morning sun in a way dew never could.

**Setting:**

Blackwood Manor, nestled deep within the heart of the English countryside, was a gothic behemoth of grey stone and shadowed gables. Gargoyles leered from every cornice, their faces permanently etched with grim amusement. The sprawling grounds surrounding the manor were Eliza's domain. They consisted of:

*   **Formal Gardens:** Manicured lawns, precisely sculpted hedges, and vibrant flowerbeds showcasing rare and exotic blooms.

*   **Wild Gardens:** A deliberate contrast to the formal gardens, designed to look untamed and natural, with winding paths that led to hidden grottos and secluded benches.

*   **The Orchard:** A haven of ancient fruit trees, their gnarled branches heavy with blossoms in spring and laden with ripe fruit in autumn.

*   **The Rose Garden:** Eliza's pride and joy, filled with hundreds of rose varieties, each carefully tended and pruned.

*   **The Lake:** A small, still body of water reflecting the manor's imposing facade, surrounded by weeping willows and a sense of quiet mystery.

Blackwood Manor had been the ancestral home of the Blackwood family for centuries, steeped in legend and whispers of secrets. The current owner, the reclusive Mr. Alistair Blackwood, rarely ventured outside its walls, leaving Eliza as the sole caretaker of its magnificent, yet often unsettling, grounds. It was a place of haunting beauty and lingering shadows, where the past clung to the present like ivy on stone.
