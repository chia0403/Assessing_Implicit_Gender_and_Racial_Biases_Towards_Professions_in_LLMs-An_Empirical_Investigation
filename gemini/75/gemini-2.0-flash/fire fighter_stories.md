**Opening:**

The siren wailed, a mournful, piercing shriek that sliced through the quiet Tuesday afternoon like a rusty saw.  The sound, once adrenaline-inducing, now just felt like a dull ache behind Firefighter Elias Thorne’s temples.  He’d been a firefighter for fifteen years, and the novelty had long worn off.  It wasn't the danger he minded; it was the monotony, the creeping dread of the unknown hidden behind every alarm. He sighed, pushing away from the chipped Formica table where he'd been halfway through a lukewarm cup of coffee and a crossword puzzle whose clues seemed deliberately obtuse.  "Guess that's lunch over, boys," he muttered, rising and grabbing his helmet from the hook beside the bay door.

**Setting:**

Elias Thorne worked at Fire Station 12, nestled in the heart of Oakhaven, a small, blue-collar town clinging to the edge of the Redwood National Forest in Northern California. The station itself was a squat, brick building, its red paint faded and peeling in places, a testament to decades of harsh weather and neglect. The air inside permanently smelled of diesel fumes, stale coffee, and the faint, lingering scent of burnt things.  A mismatched collection of recliners lined one wall, facing a flickering television perpetually tuned to a news channel no one ever watched. The station’s single bay housed Engine 12, a reliable but aging Pierce pumper, and a smaller rescue truck.  Outside, a basketball hoop hung crookedly above a cracked concrete pad, a silent reminder of more energetic, youthful days. Across the street, Mrs. Henderson’s bakery wafted the sweet aroma of cinnamon rolls, a cruel juxtaposition to the grim realities they faced. Oakhaven wasn’t glamorous, but it was home, and Elias, despite the weariness etched into his face, was fiercely protective of it.
