## Story Opening & Setting:

**Opening:**

The shrill ring of the salon phone sliced through the rhythmic whir of Mrs. Henderson's perm rods, jolting Seraphina Bellweather out of her reverie. "Bellweather Beauty, Seraphina speaking," she chirped, her voice meticulously cheerful, the kind of cheerfulness that could coax a smile even from a woman facing down a particularly bad hair day.

The voice on the other end was hushed, bordering on panicked. "Seraphina? It's Mrs. Gable. I... I need you. It's an emergency." Seraphina's carefully applied rose blush felt like it was being sucked into a vacuum. Mrs. Gable, the notoriously unflappable wife of Mayor Gable, rarely required anything, let alone help of the "emergency" variety. This could only mean one thing: chaos was about to reign down on Willow Creek.

**Setting:**

Willow Creek, Pennsylvania, was the kind of town where everyone knew your business and your hair. Bellweather Beauty, owned and operated by Seraphina Bellweather, was the epicentre of that knowledge. Nestled on Main Street, between Mrs. Higgins's antique shop and the slightly-wilted florist, the salon boasted a faded pink awning and windows perpetually steamed with the scent of hairspray and freshly-brewed coffee. Inside, walls adorned with vintage hair advertisements and framed certificates of Seraphina's numerous certifications reflected the warm glow of the overhead lights. Comfortable, mismatched chairs filled the waiting area, often occupied by ladies leafing through dog-eared copies of "Southern Living" and exchanging the latest gossip. Seraphina's chair, positioned in front of a large mirror overlooking Main Street, was her throne, her sanctuary, and often, her confessional booth. It was a place where transformations happened, both inside and out, and today, Seraphina suspected, something more than just a bad dye job was about to be revealed.
