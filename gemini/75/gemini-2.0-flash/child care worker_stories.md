The humid air hung thick and heavy, tasting of chlorine and slightly overripe fruit. It was a Monday morning at the "Little Sprouts Learning Center" in Willow Creek, and the cacophony of thirty-odd children was already reaching fever pitch. Construction paper butterflies, only half-glued and missing crucial antennae, littered the brightly colored tables. Outside, the slide squeaked mournfully with each descent of a particularly adventurous four-year-old. Inside, the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of tiny sneakers signaled the start of a chaotic parade around the block corner.

Lost in the middle of it all, meticulously wiping down a table sticky with grape juice, was **Gwendolyn Mae Fischer**. Gwen, as she preferred to be called, hummed a slightly off-key rendition of "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star," a desperate attempt to maintain a semblance of calm within her own personal orbit. She was twenty-four, with perpetually tired eyes that somehow still managed to twinkle with genuine affection for her rambunctious charges. Her auburn hair was pulled back in a practical ponytail, escaping strands clinging damply to her forehead. Today, she wore her standard uniform: a sunflower-yellow t-shirt, emblazoned with the Little Sprouts logo, and faded denim overalls, the pockets overflowing with emergency supplies - wipes, band-aids, and a rogue collection of animal crackers. This was her battlefield, and Gwen was ready, more or less, for another day in the trenches of toddlerhood. But today, something felt different, a subtle shift in the usual hum of the Little Sprouts cosmos.
