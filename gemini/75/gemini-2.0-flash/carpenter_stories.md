The scent of sawdust and sun-warmed cedar clung to Theodore Alistair Finch like a second skin. It permeated his beard, seasoned the calluses on his hands, and even seemed to seep into the threads of his worn denim overalls. Theodore stood in the doorway of his workshop, the late afternoon light painting the dust motes dancing in the air a hazy gold.

His workshop, affectionately nicknamed "The Wren's Nest," was a converted stable nestled on the edge of Oakhaven, a sleepy village draped around the base of the Whispering Mountains. The Nest was a chaotic but organized space, crammed with the tools of his trade: saws of all shapes and sizes hung from hooks, planes rested on workbenches worn smooth with decades of use, and a haphazard collection of wood scraps littered the floor, each piece holding the potential for transformation. Beyond the open doorway, the village green was a riot of summer colour, children's laughter echoing from the nearby swing set. A gentle breeze rustled through the ancient oak trees that gave Oakhaven its name, their leaves whispering secrets only the wind could understand. Today, however, Theodore remained rooted to his spot, a deep frown etched onto his brow, the idyllic scene outside failing to penetrate his troubled thoughts. He needed a project, something to quiet the anxieties that had been gnawing at him for weeks, and the right piece of wood, the right inspiration, just wouldn't come.
