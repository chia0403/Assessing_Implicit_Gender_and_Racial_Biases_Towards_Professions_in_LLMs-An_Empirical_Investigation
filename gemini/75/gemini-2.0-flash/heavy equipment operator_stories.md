The humid Georgia air hung thick and heavy, tasting of pine needles and impending rain. Sweat beaded on the brow of Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins, sticking to the grime already caked there from a morning spent wrestling his Komatsu PC360LC-11 excavator. The sun, already a malevolent eye in the bruised sky, beat down on the sprawling construction site just outside the sleepy town of Harmony Creek.

Bart, a man built like a redwood, though slightly more weathered, shifted in his seat, the leather sticking uncomfortably to his damp back. He ran a thick hand through his thinning, salt-and-pepper hair, leaving a streak of red clay dust in its wake. Harmony Creek, usually a place of gentle breezes and gossiping retirees, was in the throes of a massive upheaval. The old Harmony Creek Mill, a relic of a bygone textile era, was being torn down to make way for "The Harmony Hills Estates," a new luxury housing development promising "peaceful country living with all the modern amenities."

Bart didn't feel very peaceful. He knew the mill held memories for half the town, himself included. His own grandfather had worked there, his hands calloused and stained with dye. Now, Bart, a heavy equipment operator by trade and reluctant executioner by circumstance, was the one dismantling those memories, piece by piece. The irony tasted bitter in his mouth, as heavy and unshakeable as the steel behemoth beneath him. He sighed, the sound swallowed by the roar of the idling engine, and adjusted his worn-out Atlanta Braves cap. He had a lot more digging to do before quitting time. And he had a bad feeling, deep in his bones, that this job was going to be more than just tearing down an old building.
