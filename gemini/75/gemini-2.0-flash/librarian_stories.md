The hum of the fluorescent lights in the St. Augustine Public Library was a comforting constant to Eleanor Abigail Weatherby. It was a sound she barely registered anymore, like the rhythmic crash of waves on the nearby shore. Eleanor preferred it that way. Silence, while revered in her profession, could sometimes be deafening. The hum, on the other hand, was a gentle reminder that she wasn't alone, that the library, her sanctuary, was a living, breathing thing, whispering secrets within its brick walls.

Eleanor stood behind the towering oak circulation desk, its surface worn smooth by decades of borrowed books and hurried check-ins. The air, thick with the scent of aged paper and a hint of beeswax from the polished shelves, filled her nostrils with a familiar, almost nostalgic, feeling. Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long, slanted shadows across the manicured lawn. Tourists, still flushed from a day of exploring the historic city, trickled in, seeking refuge from the heat or perhaps a good beach read.

The St. Augustine Public Library itself was a monument to old-world charm. Housed in a former Spanish colonial governor's residence, the building boasted soaring ceilings, ornate moldings, and windows that offered glimpses of the shimmering Matanzas River just beyond the palm trees. The children's section, a vibrant explosion of color and oversized stuffed animals, was tucked away in what Eleanor suspected had once been a grand ballroom. The reference section, her particular domain, felt more like a well-appointed study, filled with leather-bound volumes and the hushed reverence of scholars seeking answers in the past.

This Tuesday in mid-July felt much like any other. A steady stream of patrons, mostly tourists with a smattering of locals, wandered the stacks. Eleanor, with her sensible cardigan, practical shoes, and hair perpetually threatening to escape its neat bun, felt like a fixture herself, as permanent and reliable as the Dewey Decimal System. But today, the familiar hum felt a little off-key. A prickle of unease, subtle but persistent, danced at the edge of her awareness. Something, she felt, was about to disrupt the predictable tranquility of her beloved library.
