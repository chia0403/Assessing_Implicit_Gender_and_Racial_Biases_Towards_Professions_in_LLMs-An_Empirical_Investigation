Okay, here's a story opening and setting, focusing on a dressmaker:

**Opening:**

The scent of pressed linen, lavender sachets, and regret clung to Beatrice Eleanor Ainsworth like the stubborn threads she often found clinging to her fingertips. It was a Tuesday morning in late October, and the weak autumn sun did little to dispel the gloom that had settled over her small shop, "Ainsworth's Attire." She paused, needle poised above a half-finished silk gown of a shimmering emerald green, and stared out the window. Mrs. Hawthorne, the baker, was sweeping her stoop, a plume of flour dust puffing into the air with each rhythmic whisk of the broom. A normal day, except for the tight knot in Beatrice's stomach that refused to loosen.

An unfamiliar automobile chugged to a stop across the street, its polished black surface gleaming in the dappled sunlight. A chauffeur emerged, crisp and formal, and opened the back door with a practiced flourish. Beatrice's breath hitched. From the vehicle stepped a woman, draped in furs and emanating an aura of wealth that made Beatrice instinctively smooth down her own faded apron. This was no casual customer popping in for a button replacement. This wasâ€¦ something else entirely.

**Setting:**

The story is set in the small, coastal town of Havenwood, Maine, in 1928. Havenwood, once a bustling shipbuilding hub, is now a quieter place, relying more on fishing and a growing tourism trade.

*   **Ainsworth's Attire:** Beatrice's shop is located on the main street, tucked between the bakery and a dusty antique store. The exterior is charming but slightly worn, with faded blue paint and a window display that, while impeccably arranged, showcases gowns from seasons past. Inside, the space is cramped but cozy, filled with bolts of fabric in every imaginable color and texture. Mannequins stand like silent observers, draped in works in progress. A large worktable dominates the center of the room, littered with patterns, pins, and spools of thread. The back room serves as both a fitting area and Beatrice's living quarters.
*   **Havenwood Itself:** The town is characterized by its weathered clapboard houses, cobblestone streets, and the ever-present sound of seagulls. The harbor is the heart of the town, lined with fishing boats and small pleasure craft. The landscape surrounding Havenwood is a mix of rocky coastline, dense forests, and windswept moors. The wealthy summer residents have started to build grand homes on the bluffs overlooking the sea, a stark contrast to the more modest dwellings of the year-round inhabitants.

Hopefully, this provides a solid foundation for your story! Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on anything or offer further ideas.
