The sodium glare of the downtown streetlights painted Detective Isabella “Izzy” Rodriguez in stark, unforgiving light. It clung to the grit on her cheekbones, emphasizing the worry lines etched around her intense brown eyes. The November wind, a razor-edged thing that smelled of brine and exhaust fumes, whipped strands of her dark, tightly-curled hair across her face. Izzy tucked them back impatiently, her gloved hand brushing against the cold steel of her Sig Sauer.

The setting was the grimy heart of Port Ascension, a city teetering on the edge of economic ruin and simmering with unspoken tensions. More specifically, she stood outside the crumbling facade of the Neptune’s Kiss, a dive bar famous for its cheap whiskey and even cheaper clientele. Neon beer signs flickered erratically in the grime-coated windows, casting a sickly, hypnotic glow onto the rain-slicked sidewalk. The air hung thick with the smell of stale beer, cigarette smoke, and something else… something acrid and metallic that made the hairs on the back of Izzy’s neck prickle. This wasn't just another Tuesday night in Port Ascension; this felt different.
