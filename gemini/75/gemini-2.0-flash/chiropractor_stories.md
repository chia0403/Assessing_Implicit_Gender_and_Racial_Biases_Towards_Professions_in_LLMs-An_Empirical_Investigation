## Story Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

The aroma of eucalyptus and desperation clung to the air, a familiar cocktail Dr. Amelia Grace Riley had come to expect by 9:00 AM on a Monday. It wasn't the eucalyptus oil she liberally diffused to soothe anxious muscles, but the lingering scent of fear and hope that permeated the small waiting room. Today, the desperation was particularly potent. It hung heavy in the silence punctuated only by the muted chime of the grandfather clock in the corner, a relic her grandfather had insisted she keep when he bequeathed her the practice. Amelia sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. This week was going to be a doozy.

**Setting:**

Dr. Amelia Grace Riley's chiropractic practice, "Riley's Relief," was nestled in the heart of Havenwood, a quaint, almost aggressively charming town in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. The building, a two-story Victorian with peeling white paint and a perpetually crooked "Open" sign, had been in the Riley family for three generations. The waiting room, with its floral wallpaper, worn velvet chairs, and overflowing magazine rack featuring issues dating back to 2018, exuded a comforting, if slightly dusty, nostalgia. Beyond the waiting room, three treatment rooms echoed with the rhythmic clicks and hums of chiropractic tables, each personalized with Amelia's own touches: a colorful quilt draped over one, a small zen garden on a shelf in another, and a collection of vintage anatomical charts adorning the walls of the third. The overall effect was less clinical and more like stepping into a quirky, albeit meticulously organized, grandmother's parlor, a deliberate choice Amelia had made to ease the anxieties of her patients. It was Havenwood, after all, and people expected a certain level of comfort, even when facing the prospect of having their spines adjusted.
