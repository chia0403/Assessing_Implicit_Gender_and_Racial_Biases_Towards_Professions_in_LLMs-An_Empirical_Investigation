The biting New York wind whipped at Thomas Bartholomew Davies’s expensive Italian wool coat as he stood on the observation deck of One Vanderbilt, feeling utterly, terribly small. He was forty-two, a senior broker at the venerable firm of Montgomery & Finch, and, by all objective measures, successful. He owned a sprawling apartment overlooking Central Park, drove a vintage Porsche he rarely had time to enjoy, and possessed a portfolio that would make most people weep with envy. But at that moment, staring out at the glittering, grid-locked city that had swallowed him whole, success felt less like an accomplishment and more like a suffocating cage.

The year was 2023. The market, still reeling from the pandemic’s initial shock, had become a volatile beast, driven by meme stocks and crypto-whales. The old rules of investing seemed to be crumbling, and with them, so was Thomas's faith in the system he had dedicated his life to. Below him, yellow cabs pulsed through canyons of steel and glass, each one a tiny spark of ambition in a relentless current of capitalism. He wondered, not for the first time, if he was contributing to something worthwhile or simply shuffling money around for the already wealthy, leaving a trail of shattered dreams in his wake. The air, crisp and cold, tasted faintly of exhaust fumes and broken promises.
