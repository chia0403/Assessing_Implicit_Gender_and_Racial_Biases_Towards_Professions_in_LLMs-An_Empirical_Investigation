## The Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** A sweltering July afternoon in Havenwood, a small, forgotten town nestled in the rolling hills of Pennsylvania. The air hangs thick and heavy, shimmering above the asphalt roads. The houses, mostly modest bungalows and two-story Victorians, are crammed together, their paint peeling in the relentless sun. The scent of pine needles and freshly cut grass battles with the metallic tang of rusted gutters and simmering tar.

**Opening:**

Sweat stung Theodore “Theo” Bartholomew Finch's eyes, blurring the already dizzying view from the roof of the O'Malley house. He swiped at it with the back of his forearm, leaving a smudge of grime that did little to improve the situation. The tar paper, baking under the relentless sun, stuck to his boots like melted candy. He cursed under his breath, a low rumble that was quickly swallowed by the drone of cicadas and the distant rumble of a passing train. This was the fourth roof he'd tackled this week, and frankly, Theo was starting to feel like a piece of overcooked bacon. He straightened, stretching his aching back, and squinted at the horizon. Another scorcher on the way, guaranteed. Havenwood needed rain, bad. And Theo Bartholomew Finch needed a damn break.
