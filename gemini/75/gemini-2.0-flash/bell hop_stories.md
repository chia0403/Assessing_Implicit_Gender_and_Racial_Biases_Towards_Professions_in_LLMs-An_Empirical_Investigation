## Story Opening:

The air in the lobby hung thick with the scent of lilies and desperation. Not that Bertram Augustine Finch, bell hop extraordinaire, was particularly bothered by either. The lilies were freshly delivered, a magnificent, if slightly cloying, display gracing the marble-topped reception desk. The desperation, on the other hand, was a familiar aroma, clinging to the shoulders of departing guests, dripping from the edges of impatient businessmen, and clinging most intensely to the tightly wound women with enough luggage to outfit a small village.

Bertram, his crisp, navy uniform impeccable, smoothed a non-existent wrinkle from his trousers and straightened his tie. He was perched, as was his custom between arriving parties, on the edge of a plush, velvet-upholstered chaise lounge, his eyes scanning the revolving doors with the hawk-like focus of a seasoned predator – or, perhaps more accurately, a seasoned bell hop hungry for a good tip. The Grand Imperial Hotel, a gilded monument to old-world glamour and new-world anxieties, was a theater, and Bertram was a player on its perpetually unfolding stage. He knew the rhythm, the cues, the hidden dramas playing out beneath the veneer of polite smiles and forced pleasantries. And tonight, he sensed, the play was about to get interesting.

## Setting:

**The Grand Imperial Hotel, New York City, Late October, 1938.**

The hotel stands on the Upper East Side, a towering edifice of Art Deco splendor. Its façade is a symphony of polished limestone and intricate metalwork, reflecting the vibrant energy of the city during the day and radiating a soft, inviting glow at night. Inside, the lobby is a cavernous space dominated by soaring ceilings, glittering chandeliers, and opulent furnishings. The air is perfumed with the scent of fresh flowers, expensive cigars, and the faint metallic tang of anticipation.

The reception desk, crafted from polished mahogany and inlaid with mother-of-pearl, is manned by a perpetually harried staff. Bellhops in crisp uniforms stand at attention, ready to whisk guests and their luggage to their rooms. Guests, a mix of socialites, business tycoons, and curious tourists, mingle in the lobby, their conversations a low, constant hum that blends with the tinkling of a grand piano emanating from the nearby lounge.

The overall atmosphere is one of refined elegance and understated power, a place where fortunes are made and broken, secrets are whispered and buried, and where Bertram Augustine Finch observes it all, a silent, attentive sentinel.
