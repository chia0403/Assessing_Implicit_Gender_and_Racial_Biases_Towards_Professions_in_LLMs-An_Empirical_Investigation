## Story Opening:

The salt spray kissed Anya Petrova's face as she clung to the rocky promontory, the biting wind whipping strands of her dark hair across her lens. The camera felt cold and heavy in her gloved hands, a familiar comfort in the face of this elemental fury. She'd been chasing this shot for weeks, battling the fickle weather of the Outer Hebrides, enduring the bone-chilling damp that seeped into everything she owned. But today… today felt different.

The sun, a hesitant, watery disc, was finally peeking through the bruised clouds, casting a fleeting, golden light on the dramatic sea stacks of Dùn Briste. They rose from the churning Atlantic like ancient sentinels, their weathered faces scarred by centuries of wind and wave. This was it. This was the moment she'd been waiting for.

Anya adjusted her focus, carefully framing the shot. She wanted to capture the raw power of the ocean, the resilience of the land, the sheer, untamed beauty that had drawn her to this remote corner of the world. She inhaled sharply, the scent of seaweed and salt filling her lungs, and pressed the shutter.

Click.

The sound was almost swallowed by the roar of the waves, but it echoed in her mind, a small victory in her ongoing battle to capture the essence of this wild and unforgiving place. But even as she reviewed the image on her camera's small screen, a prickle of unease crawled up her spine. Something was off. Something felt...wrong.

## Setting:

The story begins on the **northwestern coast of Ireland, specifically near the sea stacks of Dùn Briste in County Mayo**. The landscape is characterized by:

*   **Rugged coastline:** Jagged cliffs, rocky promontories, and hidden coves dominate the shoreline.
*   **Harsh weather:** The area is exposed to the full force of the Atlantic, with frequent storms, strong winds, and heavy rain.
*   **Dramatic sea stacks:** The iconic Dùn Briste, isolated rock formations rising dramatically from the sea, are a key feature.
*   **Sparse vegetation:** Grasses, heather, and other hardy plants cling to the rocky terrain.
*   **Remote and isolated atmosphere:** The area is sparsely populated, adding to the feeling of wildness and solitude.

The time of year is **late autumn/early winter**, contributing to the harshness of the weather and the overall sense of isolation.
