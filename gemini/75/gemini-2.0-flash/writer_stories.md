The clatter of the Smith Corona echoed through the cavernous, dust-mote-laden attic like a desperate cry for help. August Montgomery Thorne, a writer whose published works were far outweighed by the rejection slips tucked away in his cluttered desk drawer, hammered at the keys with a frantic energy. He hadn't slept properly in days, fueled by lukewarm coffee and the gnawing pressure of his upcoming deadline.

The setting was the attic of Blackwood Manor, a sprawling, gothic edifice perched precariously on the craggy cliffs overlooking the stormy Cornish coastline. It was a place of shadows and secrets, where the wind howled a mournful tune through the broken panes of the round window at the far end, and the scent of salt and decay hung heavy in the air. Dust-covered trunks overflowing with faded silks and yellowed letters lined the walls, whispering tales of long-dead Blackwood ancestors. The air was thick with the weight of history, a palpable presence that both inspired and suffocated August. He'd inherited the manor – and its accompanying debts – from his eccentric great-aunt, Agnes, a woman rumored to have dabbled in the occult and kept a pet raven she insisted could predict the future. Now, facing financial ruin, August was desperately hoping the stories that haunted the manor could be translated into a bestselling novel and save him from the same fate as his great-aunt: a life lived in lonely obscurity, surrounded only by ghosts and half-finished manuscripts.
