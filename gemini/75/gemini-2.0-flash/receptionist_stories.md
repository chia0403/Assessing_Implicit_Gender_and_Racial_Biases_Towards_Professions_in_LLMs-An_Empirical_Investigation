The fluorescent lights of "Synergy Solutions, Inc." hummed a dull, monotonous tune, a sound that Mrs. Mildred Periwinkle had long since learned to filter out, like the endless pronouncements about "synergy" itself. It was 7:58 AM, and Mildred, a woman whose hair resembled a tightly-rolled cloud of spun sugar and whose wardrobe choices leaned heavily towards pastel cardigans, was already seated at her immaculately organized reception desk.

The setting: a bland, beige-on-beige lobby. A single, oversized abstract painting in muted tones hung behind her, a piece that Mildred suspected was chosen specifically for its ability to offend no one. Two uncomfortable-looking faux leather chairs sat flanking a glass coffee table, upon which rested a stack of Synergy Solutions brochures and a wilting peace lily. Sunlight, stubbornly attempting to pierce through the tinted windows, only served to illuminate the dust motes dancing in the air. Outside, the traffic of downtown Chicago was already building to a cacophonous roar, a stark contrast to the sterile quiet of the waiting area. Mildred, however, found a certain comfort in the hum, the beige, and the wilting lily. It was predictable, and predictability, after all, was a welcome balm in a world so often steeped in the chaotic and the unforeseen. And in a few minutes, the first employee would arrive, marking the official start of another perfectly ordinary, perfectly beige, day.
