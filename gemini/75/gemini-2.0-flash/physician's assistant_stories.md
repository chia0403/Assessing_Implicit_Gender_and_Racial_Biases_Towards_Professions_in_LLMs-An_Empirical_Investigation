## Story Opening:

The metallic tang of blood and antiseptic hung in the air, a smell Beatrice Eleanor Harding had come to associate more with comfort than dread. It was the smell of her workplace, the smell of helping people, and frankly, after a twelve-hour shift at the overcrowded Free Clinic of Oakhaven, it was the smell of finally being able to see her own reflection in the stainless steel sink without flinching at the exhaustion etched into her face.

Beatrice scrubbed her hands, the rough, fragrant soap a welcome contrast to the sterile gloves she'd worn all day. She was bone-tired, a weariness that settled deep in her muscles, but there was a peculiar satisfaction buzzing beneath the fatigue. She'd sutured a gash on a kid's knee, calmed a terrified elderly woman struggling with bronchitis, and even managed to convince a young man to finally get tested for STIs. Small victories, maybe, but in Oakhaven, small victories felt like epic battles won.

She glanced at the clock. Almost eight pm. The last of the volunteer nurses had trickled out an hour ago, leaving Beatrice alone with the lingering hum of the fluorescent lights and the ghosts of the day's anxieties. Time to lock up, head home, and collapse. Just as she reached for her worn leather bag, a frantic pounding echoed through the clinic's empty waiting room.

## Setting:

The Free Clinic of Oakhaven occupies a converted storefront on the edge of Oakhaven's struggling downtown. The building itself is a testament to good intentions fighting a losing battle against a lack of funding. Peeling paint chips off the exterior brick, revealing layers of forgotten businesses underneath – "Oakhaven Bakery" in faded blue script, "Miller's Dry Goods" in ghostly white letters.

Inside, the clinic is a patchwork of repurposed furniture and donated medical equipment. Exam rooms are cramped and sparsely furnished, their walls adorned with posters about preventative health measures that have seen better days. The waiting room is a collection of mismatched chairs, some ripped and patched, surrounding a scarred coffee table piled high with dog-eared magazines. A small, brightly coloured mural painted by local schoolchildren depicting healthy fruits and vegetables attempts to brighten the otherwise drab space.

Despite its limitations, the clinic is the heart of Oakhaven's underserved population. It’s a place where people without insurance or the means to pay for traditional healthcare can receive basic medical care, advice, and a sense of belonging. The air within the clinic, while often smelling of antiseptic and stress, also holds a faint undercurrent of hope, fueled by the dedication of the staff and the resilience of the patients who rely on it.
