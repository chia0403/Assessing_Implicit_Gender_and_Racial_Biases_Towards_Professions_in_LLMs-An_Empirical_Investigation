Okay, here's a story opening, including the full name of the main character, a guidance counselor, and the setting:

**Opening:**

The hum of the fluorescent lights was a relentless counterpoint to the soft, rhythmic thrumming in Dr. Eleanor Vance's temples. It was Tuesday afternoon, affectionately known as "Teenage Tsunami Tuesday" in the guidance office of Northwood High. The day where every academic crisis, relationship drama, and existential angst seemed to converge at her door like a flock of distressed pigeons.

Eleanor leaned back in her ergonomically designed chair (a small victory in the bureaucratic war against uncomfortable school furniture), took a deep breath, and massaged the bridge of her nose. The scent of stale coffee, lavender air freshener (another losing battle against teenage body spray), and the faint, lingering aroma of burned popcorn (courtesy of the student lounge down the hall) clung to the air.

Outside her window, the autumnal colors of New England were beginning their slow, fiery descent. Maple trees blazed red and orange against the slate gray of the sky, a beautiful, brutal reminder that time, like the academic year, was relentlessly marching onward. And that, thought Eleanor, was precisely what made her job so exhausting.

**Setting:**

**Northwood High School, located in the fictional, affluent suburb of Havenwood, Massachusetts.** The school building itself is a sprawling, brick structure, dating back to the 1950s, but with a relatively modern, glass-walled wing housing the science labs and a newly renovated auditorium. Havenwood is a town known for its excellent public schools, its manicured lawns, and the pressure cooker atmosphere it cultivates for its students. The guidance office is tucked away on the second floor, a small, slightly cramped space crammed with brochures for colleges, scholarship applications, and posters showcasing motivational quotes (most of which Eleanor had long since stopped truly seeing).
