## Story Opening & Setting:

**Opening:**

The aroma of burnt sugar hung thick and heavy in the air, a suffocating blanket against the already oppressive August heat. Beatrice Eleanor Ainsworth swore under her breath, fanning the acrid smoke with a tea towel. This was the third batch of macarons she’d ruined this morning, and the annual Sweetest Treats Bake-Off was only a week away. The pressure was starting to feel less like motivation and more like a constricting noose.

**Setting:**

Beatrice's haven, or more accurately, *Beatrice's Blissful Bites*, was a small, brightly coloured bakery nestled on the corner of Lavender Lane in the charming coastal town of Seabreeze, Maine. The shop’s exterior was painted a cheerful buttercup yellow with vibrant lavender trim, mirroring the flowers that cascaded from overflowing window boxes. Inside, the air was usually thick with the comforting scents of vanilla, cinnamon, and freshly baked bread. Rows of pastel-coloured cakes, intricately decorated cupcakes, and glistening pies lined glass display cases, beckoning passersby with their sugary allure. Sunlight streamed through the large front window, illuminating the whimsical, hand-painted murals depicting anthropomorphic pastries enjoying picnics and seaside adventures. Today, however, the cheerful ambiance was marred by the lingering smell of carbon, a testament to Beatrice's growing anxiety and the increasingly disastrous state of her macarons.
