**Story Opening:**

The flickering neon sign of the *Neptune Diner* buzzed like an angry wasp trapped in a jar, casting an erratic, turquoise glow across the rain-slicked streets of Port Blossom. Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of stale coffee and frying onions â€“ a comforting, if slightly depressing, aroma on a night like this. Outside, the relentless downpour hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a constant drumbeat against the solitude.

Elias Theodore Vance, electrician extraordinaire, hunched over a steaming mug, the warmth radiating into his calloused hands.  He watched the swirling cream create fleeting galaxies in the dark liquid, his brow furrowed in concentration. He was supposed to be home, tucked in, prepping for an early start. Mrs. Gable's vintage chandelier had decided to wage war against gravity, and she was expecting a miracle of restoration by 8 a.m. But the silence in his own apartment was deafening tonight.  He needed the greasy comfort of the *Neptune,* the quiet hum of strangers around him, anything to stave off the loneliness gnawing at his edges. A loneliness that, like the city's aging infrastructure, was proving increasingly difficult to repair.
