**Opening:**

The crackle of static spit from the radio, momentarily drowning out the comforting drone of the Pratt & Whitney R-1830 Twin Wasp engines. Lieutenant Commander Amelia “Amy” Vance ignored it, her eyes fixed on the jagged, snow-capped peaks rising before her. Below, the churning, gray water of the Aleutian Sea stretched to the horizon, a vast and unforgiving landscape mirroring the knot of anxiety tightening in her stomach. This wasn't just a routine patrol. This was a gut feeling, a prickly sense of unease that had been dogging her ever since she'd poured herself her morning coffee – weak, lukewarm, and brewed with the distinct premonition that something was about to go very, very wrong.

**Setting:**

The year is 1943. The scene unfolds over the Aleutian Islands, a desolate, windswept archipelago straddling the Bering Sea between Alaska and Russia. The air is biting cold, even within the confines of Amelia's Lockheed PV-1 Ventura bomber, nicknamed "The Albatross" by her crew. The sky is a canvas of perpetual gray, broken only occasionally by patches of weak sunlight struggling to pierce the heavy cloud cover. The Aleutians are a vital, albeit often forgotten, front in the Pacific Theater of World War II. The strategic importance of these islands makes them a constant target for Japanese incursions, and the US Navy patrols are relentless, a necessary vigilance against an enemy that could strike from the fog at any moment. The constant isolation and harsh conditions have left their mark on the American servicemen stationed here – a grim determination etched onto their faces, a shared understanding of the constant threat that hangs in the air. The airbase, a collection of Quonset huts clinging precariously to a volcanic rock, is a haven of sorts, but also a stark reminder of the war raging across the Pacific.
