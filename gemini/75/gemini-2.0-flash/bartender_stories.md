The clink of ice against glass, a sound Beatrice Marguerite Dubois had heard so often it had become a kind of white noise, was unusually loud tonight. It echoed in the near-empty expanse of The Gilded Lily, bouncing off the mirrored back wall and the plush, velvet booths that lined the perimeter like crimson secrets. Usually, the bar was a low hum of conversation, a swirl of cigarette smoke, and the melancholic croon of Billie Holiday from the antique gramophone tucked in the corner. Tonight, however, a bone-chilling silence had settled, broken only by the rhythmic swish of Beatrice’s bar towel and the occasional drip from a leaky faucet.

The Gilded Lily itself felt more haunted than gilded this evening. Situated on the wrong side of the tracks in the heart of New Orleans’ French Quarter, it was a relic of a bygone era. The Art Deco architecture, once gleaming, was now faded, the gold leaf peeling in places like sunburnt skin. The air, thick with the ghosts of gin-soaked laughter and broken dreams, clung to everything – the worn mahogany bar, the chipped ceramic ashtrays, even the heavy scent of jasmine wafting from the courtyard just beyond the saloon doors. The flickering gas lamps cast long, dancing shadows, turning the ornate details of the interior into grotesque caricatures. Beatrice, leaning against the bar, polishing a glass that was already spotless, couldn't shake the feeling that she was waiting, not for a customer, but for something far more ominous to arrive. The storm outside, mirroring the one brewing inside her, only amplified the disquiet.
