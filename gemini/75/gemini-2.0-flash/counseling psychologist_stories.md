## Story Opening:

The insistent chirping of his phone sliced through the otherwise peaceful hum of the waiting room. Dr. Alistair Finch sighed, pushing back from his desk just far enough to snatch the offending device. He glanced at the caller ID – his sister, Beatrice. He debated ignoring it. Beatrice calling before his first appointment of the day usually meant a fresh catastrophe of the floral-arrangement-gone-wrong variety, and Alistair was in no mood for gladioli-related melodrama.

He answered anyway. “Bea? What is it this time? Did a rogue peony attack someone?”

A breathless voice, laced with anxiety, tumbled through the speaker. “Ali! You won’t believe this. Mother…”

Alistair closed his eyes, bracing himself. He really, really hoped it didn’t involve his mother and power tools again. It had been six months since the Great Hedge Trimmer Incident of ’23, and he was still having flashbacks. He pinched the bridge of his nose and waited for the inevitable.
## Setting:

Dr. Alistair Finch's office occupied the second floor of a converted Victorian house in the quiet, leafy neighborhood of Oakwood Heights. Sunlight streamed through the large, arched windows, dappling the Persian rug beneath his feet with warmth. The walls were painted a calming shade of sage green, adorned with carefully curated, abstract art – pieces that were interesting enough to hold the eye but not so distracting as to become the focus of conversation.

His desk was a large, mahogany antique, inherited from his grandfather, a renowned ornithologist. While Alistair himself possessed a somewhat shaky knowledge of birds, he appreciated the desk's sturdy presence and the sense of history it provided. Scattered across its surface were meticulously arranged stacks of files, a sleek silver laptop, and a small, framed photograph of him, his sister Beatrice, and their perpetually exasperated mother, all standing stiffly in front of the Leaning Tower of Pisa. It served as a reminder that even the most seemingly stable structures can be prone to leaning.

Across from the desk sat two comfortable armchairs, upholstered in a soft, textured fabric, positioned to encourage open and honest conversation. A small side table held a box of tissues, strategically placed within easy reach. The entire space was designed to be a sanctuary, a haven where anxieties could be explored and vulnerabilities could be laid bare, all under the watchful, empathetic gaze of Dr. Alistair Finch.
