The clatter of Mrs. Higgins' dentures always heralded trouble. Eleanor "Ellie" Marie Dubois could hear them chattering from the back, over the hum of the hairdryer and the rhythmic snip-snip-snipping of Brenda giving Mr. Henderson his weekly trim. Ellie took a deep breath, smoothed down the front of her floral print smock, and pasted on a smile that felt as fragile as spun sugar.

The setting was "Shear Bliss," a small-town hair salon nestled on Main Street in Harmony Creek, Iowa. The air was thick with the scent of perm solution, hairspray, and the lingering aroma of Mrs. Higgins' penchant for heavily perfumed hair tonic. Sunlight streamed through the large front window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and reflecting off the chrome of the vintage barber's chairs. The walls were painted a cheerful (though slightly faded) daffodil yellow and adorned with framed photographs of outdated hairstyles - feathered bangs, permed mullets, and gravity-defying beehives. Shear Bliss was a time capsule, a comfortable, if somewhat predictable, haven in a world that seemed to be moving at an increasingly frantic pace. And Ellie, with her warm smile and nimble fingers, was its resident guardian.
