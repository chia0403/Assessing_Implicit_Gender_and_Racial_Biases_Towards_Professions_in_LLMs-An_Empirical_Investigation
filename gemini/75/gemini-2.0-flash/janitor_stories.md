## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights hummed a mournful tune across the polished linoleum of the Westview County Courthouse. Not the cheerful hum of productivity, but the tired, droning sigh of a building left alone with its ghosts. Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins, mop in hand, knew that sigh intimately. He'd heard it every night for the past fifteen years, a constant companion as he chased away the day's debris and prepared the silent halls for another cycle of legal battles and bureaucratic pronouncements.

Tonight, however, the hum seemed different, deeper somehow, resonating not just in his ears but in his bones. He pushed his mop bucket towards the Judge Mallory's chambers, the rubber wheels squeaking a discordant note against the otherwise silent backdrop. Bart paused at the heavy oak door, a strange prickling sensation crawling across the back of his neck. He’d seen the judge leave hours ago, briefcase clutched tight, a frown etched deeper than usual into his weathered face. Something felt…off.

He hesitated, his hand hovering over the handle. He was just a janitor, a cog in the machine of justice, not meant to concern himself with the anxieties of judges or the secrets held within these walls. But that deeper hum, that unsettling feeling, urged him onward. With a deep breath, Bartholomew Higgins pushed open the door, ready to face whatever the courthouse, in its lonely, silent despair, had to reveal.

## Setting:

**Location:** Westview County Courthouse, a grand but slightly decaying building located in the fictional, small town of Westview, nestled amongst rolling hills and farmland in Pennsylvania.

**Time:** Late evening, around 10:30 PM.

**Atmosphere:** The courthouse exudes a sense of both history and quiet desperation. The once-gleaming floors are now scuffed, the paint is peeling in places, and the air is thick with the weight of past decisions and unresolved conflicts. Despite its imposing exterior, the building feels vulnerable and slightly forgotten at this late hour. The fluorescent lighting casts long, stark shadows, adding to the feeling of unease.
