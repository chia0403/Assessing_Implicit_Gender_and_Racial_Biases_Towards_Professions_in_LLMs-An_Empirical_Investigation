The chipped mug warmed Johnathan "Rooster" McKinley's calloused hands as he watched the predawn light creep across the Nevada desert. The diner, "The Last Stop," was exactly that â€“ a greasy spoon oasis seemingly plucked from the middle of nowhere, sitting squat and defiant against a backdrop of endless sand and scraggly Joshua trees. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of frying bacon and regret, punctuated by the rhythmic hiss of the ancient espresso machine. Rooster took a long, slow sip of his coffee, the bitterness a welcome jolt against the exhaustion clinging to him like the desert dust coating his rig, "The Wandering Star." He ran a hand over his grizzled beard, the rough texture a familiar comfort. He had another six hours of hauling a load of industrial pipe to Salt Lake City, and the thought of it made his back ache just thinking about it. He needed this caffeine jolt, this fleeting moment of stillness, before the open road swallowed him whole again. He just hoped, for once, this trip would be uneventful. Lately, uneventful seemed like a luxury he couldn't afford.
