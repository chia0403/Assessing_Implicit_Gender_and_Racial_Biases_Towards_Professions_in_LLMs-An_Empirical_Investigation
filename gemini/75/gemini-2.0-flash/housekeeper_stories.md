## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The biting January wind whipped snow against the tall, gothic windows of Blackwood Manor, a relic of a bygone era perched precariously on the craggy cliffs overlooking the churning Atlantic. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of beeswax, dust motes danced in the feeble sunlight filtering through the leaded glass, and the silence, broken only by the groan of the ancient house settling, felt heavier than any physical object.

**Story Opening:**

Eliza Mae Thornton sighed, the sound a small puff of white against the chill of the morning air. Another day, another labyrinth of rooms to dust, another layer of grime to peel from the ornate surfaces of Blackwood Manor. She tightened the scarf around her neck, the worn wool a familiar comfort against the persistent draft that permeated the house. She’d been cleaning for the Blackwood family for nearly fifteen years now, practically a fixture in this crumbling monument to wealth and eccentricity. But today felt different. A prickling unease settled in her stomach, a feeling as unwelcome and persistent as the damp that clung to the cellar walls. It wasn't just the usual January gloom, or the endless list of tasks Mrs. Blackwood had scribbled on the back of a shopping receipt. No, this was a different kind of weight, a feeling that something was…shifting, settling into a darker, more unsettling place. As she reached for the duster and began her ascent up the winding, creaking staircase towards the portrait gallery, Eliza couldn’t shake the feeling that she was walking towards something more than just another day of cleaning. She was walking towards something unknown, something hidden deep within the heart of Blackwood Manor.
