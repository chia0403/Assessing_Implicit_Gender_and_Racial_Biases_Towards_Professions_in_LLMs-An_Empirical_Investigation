Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a pharmacist as the main character:

**Setting:**

The setting is the sleepy, almost forgotten town of Havenwood, nestled deep in the Appalachian Mountains. Havenwood is a place where time seems to move slower, and the scent of pine needles and woodsmoke hangs heavy in the air. Main Street consists of a handful of businesses: a dusty antique shop, a general store with a creaking wooden porch, a diner perpetually serving lukewarm coffee, and Havenwood Pharmacy. The pharmacy itself is small, with faded floral wallpaper, shelves lined with amber bottles and neatly stacked boxes of bandages, and a comforting, slightly medicinal smell that permeates the air. Sunlight struggles to penetrate the tall trees that surround the town, giving Havenwood a perpetual twilight feel.

**Story Opening:**

Beatrice Eleanor Abernathy, her silver hair pulled back in a practical bun, surveyed the empty street from behind the counter of Havenwood Pharmacy. The clock above the aspirin display read 2:17 PM. Another Tuesday. Another day where the most exciting thing to happen would probably be Mrs. Henderson forgetting to take her blood pressure medication *again*. Beatrice sighed, the sound barely audible over the gentle hum of the refrigerator where she kept the insulin. She was arranging a new shipment of cough drops, meticulously placing each bag in a neat row, when the bell above the door *jingle-jingled* – a sound so rare these days that it made her jump. A tall, dark-haired man, with a worn leather satchel slung across his shoulder, stood just inside the doorway, his eyes scanning the shelves with an intensity that made Beatrice instantly wary. He wasn’t from around here. He had that city look about him – the kind that said “I don’t belong, and I know it.” Beatrice straightened, adjusted her spectacles, and put on her most professional, yet subtly guarded, pharmacist smile. "May I help you?" she asked, her voice a little sharper than she intended.
