**Setting:** The biting wind of a November morning whipped down the cobblestone street of Grimhaven, a town clinging precariously to the edge of the Blackwood Forest. The air, perpetually thick with the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth, today carried a sharper, more metallic tang – the scent of first frost meeting fresh blood. Shop signs, gnarled and weathered, creaked in the wind, their paint peeling like sunburnt skin. The butcher shop, “Grimhaven Cuts,” was nestled between a perpetually shadowed apothecary and a cobbler whose hammer always seemed to echo a little too loud in the narrow alleyway.

**Story Opening:**

Amelia Beatrice Cartwright, wrapped in a blood-stained apron that seemed more a permanent fixture than an article of clothing, slammed the cleaver down on a stubborn rib bone with the force of a thunderclap. The bone cracked with a satisfying snap. Amelia, her face flushed from the exertion, blew a stray strand of auburn hair from her eyes, her brow furrowed in concentration. The fluorescent lights of the shop hummed a discordant tune overhead, a stark contrast to the rhythmic thump, thump, thump of the cleaver on the butcher block. Grimhaven Cuts wasn't exactly bustling this early, but Amelia preferred it that way. It allowed her to commune with the meat, to respect the sacrifice, to prepare it with the precision and artistry her grandfather, Silas, had instilled in her. Today, however, her usual calm was fractured. A chill deeper than the cold storage room had settled in her bones. The unsettling dream from the night before, filled with whispering shadows and eyes that glowed like embers in the Blackwood Forest, still clung to her like the smell of rendering fat. And then there was the raven, perched on the sign outside, its obsidian eyes fixated on her every move. Ravens, in Grimhaven, were never a good sign.
