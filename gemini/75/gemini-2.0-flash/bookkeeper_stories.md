The aroma of dust motes dancing in the afternoon sun, mingled with the sharp, metallic scent of ink, always calmed Beatrice Eleanor Ainsworth. She found solace amidst the towering stacks of ledgers within the confines of "Goodfellow & Sons, Importers of Fine Goods," a cramped, century-old establishment nestled in the cobblestone heart of London's Smithfield Market.

Beatrice, a woman whose thirty-odd years had begun to etch themselves lightly around her perpetually worried brow, wasn't merely a bookkeeper; she was the keeper of Goodfellow & Sons' secrets, whispered in columns of numbers and underlined in faded ink. The room itself was a testament to time, with walls a sickly green from years of gaslight and a single, perpetually flickering gas lamp casting long, dancing shadows. Outside, the raucous cries of market vendors vying for attention and the rhythmic clatter of horse-drawn carts formed a chaotic symphony, a stark contrast to the quiet order Beatrice imposed upon the financial records within. It was 1898, and the air, thick with the promise of autumn, held both the familiar comfort of routine and a simmering unease that Beatrice, with her keen eye for detail, couldn’t quite ignore. Something felt…off.
