The setting was the kind of place you could feel in your bones, a place where the soil was thick with history and the air buzzed with the low hum of cicadas in the long, golden afternoons. Gilead, Nebraska. It was a patchwork of rolling hills stitched together by fields of amber wheat and rust-colored corn stalks, a place where generations had toiled under the relentless prairie sun, their sweat and dreams watering the land. 

From the porch of his weathered farmhouse, Elijah Thorne, a man whose face bore the map of a life lived under that very sun, surveyed his kingdom. Dawn was just breaking, painting the eastern sky in hues of peach and rose, chasing away the indigo shadows clinging to the hollows of the fields. He inhaled deeply, the scent of damp earth and ripening corn filling his lungs. Another day. Another harvest. He took a long pull from his chipped enamel mug, the bitter black coffee warming him against the cool morning air. This year, though, something felt different. A prickle of unease settled in his stomach, a premonition that rustled through him like the wind whispering through the cornfields â€“ a feeling he hadn't known since the drought of '88. And Elijah Thorne, with his hands calloused by years of labor and his eyes the color of a stormy sky, knew better than to ignore the whispers of the land.
