## Story Opening:

The scent of lilies and old money hung heavy in the air of the Grand Edgemont Hotel, a fragrance Eleanor Rose Hawthorne knew intimately. She adjusted the crisp, embroidered lapel of her navy blue uniform and straightened the perfectly aligned pens on her mahogany desk. Another Tuesday morning, another carefully orchestrated performance in the theatre of luxury.

Eleanor, a woman whose smile could soothe a screaming infant and whose memory was sharper than a tack, hadn’t anticipated the tremors that now ran through her fingers. It wasn't the early hour, nor the demanding requests she knew would soon be flooding in. It was the folded newspaper lying innocuously on the corner of her desk. A small, black-and-white photograph stared up at her from the society page. The caption read, "Mr. Julian Blackwood Announces Engagement."

Eleanor took a slow, deliberate breath, the air catching in her throat like a misplaced pearl. Julian. The name was a ghost, a whisper of a past she’d locked away for nearly fifteen years. She hadn’t seen him, hadn't heard from him, not a single word since… well, since the catastrophic event that had landed her, Eleanor Rose Hawthorne, debutante turned dropout, here, behind this polished desk, as head concierge of the Grand Edgemont.

## Setting:

The Grand Edgemont Hotel, a sprawling edifice of Gilded Age architecture, dominated a prime corner of downtown Charleston, South Carolina. Built in the early 20th century, it boasted soaring ceilings, intricately carved moldings, and crystal chandeliers that glittered like captured stars. The lobby, a vast expanse of marble and plush velvet, was perpetually bustling with a symphony of languages, the click-clack of designer heels on the polished floor, and the hushed tones of discreet conversations.

Eleanor's desk, positioned strategically near the main entrance, was her domain. A sleek, custom-built workstation with a built-in computer, phone bank, and an impossibly organized array of maps, brochures, and restaurant guides. Behind her, shelves lined with leather-bound books and framed photographs of the hotel's illustrious past served as a silent testament to its history. From this vantage point, Eleanor could observe the comings and goings of the city’s elite, a constant, curated drama unfolding before her eyes. And now, it seemed, a drama that threatened to engulf her own carefully constructed life.
