Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a phlebotomist:

**Setting:** The fluorescent lights hummed a relentless, buzzing counterpoint to the rhythmic beeping of the heart monitor in Bayview Medical Center's Cardiac Care Unit. It was 3:00 AM, and the air hung thick with the stale scent of antiseptic and fear. Outside, the predawn drizzle painted streaks down the tall windows, blurring the twinkling lights of Baltimore's harbor. Inside, the only light seemed to emanate from the screens tracking vital signs and the weary faces of the nurses.

**Story Opening:**

"Another draw, huh?" Agnes sighed, her breath misting slightly in the cool, regulated air. The patient, a frail woman with a network of blue veins visible beneath papery skin, offered a weak smile.

"Morning, Agnes," she rasped, her voice thin as tracing paper. "Just the usual, I suppose?"

Agnes Marie Dubois, badge clipped neatly to her starched blue scrubs, nodded, her own smile warm and practiced. It was her job, after all, to be a source of calm in this chaotic, often terrifying, environment. She'd seen it all in her fifteen years as a phlebotomist â€“ the triumphs, the tragedies, the quiet moments of human connection woven between the pricks and vials. Tonight, though, something felt different. A subtle unease, a prickle at the back of her neck, like a phantom vein she couldn't quite locate. She pushed it aside, attributed it to the hour and the relentless cycle of life and death that swirled around her. "Just the usual," she echoed, snapping on her gloves. "Just a little pinch, and then you can get back to sleep." But even as she spoke, Agnes couldn't shake the feeling that this particular 'usual' wasn't going to be so usual after all.
