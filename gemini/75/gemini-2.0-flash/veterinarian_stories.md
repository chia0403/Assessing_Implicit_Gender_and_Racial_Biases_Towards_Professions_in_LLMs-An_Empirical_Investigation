The biting wind, laced with the scent of pine and damp earth, whipped Dr. Amelia Iris Bellweather's auburn hair across her face as she wrestled with the recalcitrant latch of the stable door. Inside, the pre-dawn gloom hung thick, punctuated only by the soft rustling of straw and the rhythmic breathing of horses. Amelia cursed under her breath, her fingers numb with cold despite the thick woolen gloves. This was exactly the kind of call that made her question her life choices at 4:30 in the morning.

Amelia's veterinary practice, "Bellweather Animal Care," served the sprawling rural community nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. The landscape was a tapestry of rolling pastures, dense forests, and sleepy hamlets, populated by a mix of hardscrabble farmers, affluent weekenders, and eccentric locals who clung fiercely to their traditions. She lived and worked in the heart of it all, in a small, weather-beaten house just outside the town of Havenwood, Virginia, a place where gossip spread faster than the morning mist and everyone knew everyone else's business - especially Amelia's.
