## Story Opening & Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The scent of burnt coffee and industrial strength disinfectant hung heavy in the air, a familiar aroma that clung to Dr. Eleanor Vance like a second skin. She sighed, the weariness settling in her bones like winter chill. It was 7:00 AM, an hour before the first patients arrived, and Eleanor was already staring down a mountain of paperwork that seemed to multiply exponentially overnight. Outside, the November sky was a bruised purple, promising a day of relentless grey. She took a long, deliberate sip of the acrid coffee, bracing herself. Today, she’d be helping a young boy learn to tie his shoelaces after a traumatic brain injury, guiding an elderly woman relearn to button her coat after a stroke, and working with a teenager struggling to grip a pencil due to juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Each a battle, each a victory waiting to be fought. The battles she didn’t mind. It was the paperwork that truly threatened to break her spirit.

**Setting:**

Eleanor Vance works at **"The Helping Hand Rehabilitation Center,"** a medium-sized facility nestled in the heart of **downtown Portland, Oregon.** The center occupies the second and third floors of a renovated brick building, its exterior a muted, earthy tone softened by climbing ivy. Inside, the atmosphere is a carefully curated blend of clinical functionality and warm comfort. 

The therapy rooms are equipped with specialized equipment: parallel bars, adaptive tools, sensory integration materials, and brightly colored exercise equipment. The walls are decorated with motivational posters and patient artwork, a testament to the progress made within its walls. Natural light streams through the large windows, offering a panoramic view of the city's bustling streets and the distant, snow-capped peaks of the Cascade Mountains. Despite the urban location, the center strives to be a sanctuary, a place where individuals can rebuild their lives and rediscover their independence.
