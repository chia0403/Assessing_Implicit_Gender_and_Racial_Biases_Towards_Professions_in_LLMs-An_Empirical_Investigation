The oppressive Georgia humidity clung to everything like a guilt-ridden conscience. Even the shade offered by the sprawling oak trees that lined the streets of Savannah felt thick and suffocating. Amelia "Amy" Rossetti, a paralegal with the prestigious but often morally ambiguous law firm of Davenport & Sterling, wiped a bead of sweat from her brow with the back of her hand. The dampness did little to alleviate the feeling that something was deeply, fundamentally wrong.

Amy stood before the stately, albeit slightly dilapidated, Victorian mansion on Jones Street. Known locally as the "Hartwell House," it was shrouded in the kind of history that clung to Savannah like Spanish moss – romantic, tragic, and possibly haunted. The peeling paint whispered tales of fortunes made and lost, of whispered secrets and illicit affairs.

She adjusted the strap of her worn leather messenger bag, her fingers tracing the outline of the thick file inside. It contained everything Amy knew about the late, eccentric Eleanor Hartwell's estate – a labyrinthine puzzle box of codicils, hidden assets, and a beneficiary list that read like a Who's Who of Savannah's elite…and the very seedy underbelly they pretended didn't exist. Eleanor Hartwell had died alone, at the age of ninety-two, leaving behind a fortune and a legacy of whispered speculation. And Amy Rossetti, diligent paralegal with a knack for finding things that weren't meant to be found, was about to step inside and uncover the secrets the Hartwell House had desperately been trying to keep buried.
