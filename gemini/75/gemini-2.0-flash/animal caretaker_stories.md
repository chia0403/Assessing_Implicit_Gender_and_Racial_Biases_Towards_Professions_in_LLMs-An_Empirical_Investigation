Okay, here's a story opening and setting focusing on an animal caretaker:

**Setting:**

The biting wind whipped off the grey-churning Atlantic, stinging Eliza Maeve O’Connell’s cheeks as she trudged across the perpetually damp flagstones towards the seal enclosure. Coastal Maine in late November wasn’t for the faint of heart. The Sanctuary for Lost Souls and Weather-Beaten Wildlife, affectionately known by locals as simply “The Ark,” clung precariously to the craggy coastline just north of Bar Harbor. It was a chaotic collection of mismatched buildings: a repurposed fish processing plant served as the main infirmary, a series of aging yurts housed the smaller mammals, and the aviary, a magnificent geodesic dome, was perpetually shrouded in mist, making it feel like a lost world inside. The constant, low moan of foghorns provided a melancholic soundtrack to Eliza's daily routine. The salt-laced air permeated everything - her clothes, her skin, even the inside of her nose. The smell of fish, brine, and something vaguely wild was as familiar to her as her own breath.

**Story Opening:**

Eliza Maeve O’Connell didn't flinch as a blast of icy spray hit her square in the face. Years of working at The Ark had hardened her, both physically and emotionally. She tugged her woolen hat further down over her ears and double-checked the latch on the heavy gate leading into the seal enclosure. Inside, Finn, a magnificent, scarred harbor seal, was already pacing anxiously, his mournful bark echoing across the enclosure. He’d been rescued after being found tangled in fishing nets, his flipper badly damaged. Eliza had nursed him back to health, spending hours coaxing him to eat, cleaning his wounds, and simply talking to him in a low, soothing voice. He was almost ready to be released, but something had been off with him the last couple of days. His appetite was waning, and he seemed unusually lethargic. “Morning, Finn-boy,” Eliza said, her voice thick with a Maine accent. “Let’s see what’s troublin’ you today, shall we?” The seal stopped pacing, his dark, intelligent eyes fixed on her. Usually, he'd eagerly approach her with anticipation of a treat or head scratch. But now, he simply watched, a low, distressed whine escaping his throat. A knot of unease tightened in Eliza’s stomach. This was more than just pre-release jitters. Something was definitely wrong.
