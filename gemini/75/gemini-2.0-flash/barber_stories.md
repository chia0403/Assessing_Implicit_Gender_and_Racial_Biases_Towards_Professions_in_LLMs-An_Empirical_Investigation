## Story Opening:

The scent of bay rum and despair hung thick in the air, clinging to the chipped porcelain sink and the faded crimson velvet of the barber's chair. Bartholomew "Bart" Finchley sighed, wiping a stray curl of silver hair from his already-balding head. He'd been staring at the brass clock above the mirror for the better part of an hour, its tick-tock a relentless metronome counting down the minutes to another slow afternoon at Finchley's Fine Shaves and Haircuts. The town of Hollow Creek wasn't exactly booming, and lately, it seemed like the only heads of hair making their way through his door were attached to the weary, the wary, and the occasionally-too-drunk-to-care. Today, however, even those were scarce. Bart leaned back against the worn leather of his stool, the springs groaning in protest, and wondered if he should just close up shop and join Mrs. Henderson for bingo down at the community center. At least there, the stakes were low, and the company, if nothing else, was predictably eccentric.

## Setting:

Finchley's Fine Shaves and Haircuts, located on the quieter end of Main Street in Hollow Creek, Pennsylvania, looked like a relic from a bygone era. Stepping inside was like entering a time capsule. The walls were painted a pale, almost sickly, green, and were adorned with framed posters of vintage razor blades and Brylcreem advertisements, their edges yellowed and peeling. Sunlight, filtered through dust-laden lace curtains hanging in the front window, cast an ethereal glow on the interior. The air, as mentioned, was perpetually saturated with the aroma of bay rum, mixed with the faint, metallic tang of razor blades and the lingering ghosts of tobacco smoke.

The shop consisted of a single room, dominated by the antique barber's chair â€“ a monstrous thing of chrome and crimson velvet, its footrest worn smooth by decades of use. Across from the chair stood a long, marble-topped counter, cluttered with shaving mugs, brushes, and an assortment of tonics and lotions in amber-colored bottles. A well-worn leather strop hung from a hook on the wall, ready to hone a blade to razor sharpness. In the corner, a silent, black-and-white television sat perched on a stack of dusty magazines, a relic Bart had inherited from his father, who had inherited it from his father before him. The overall impression was one of comfortable decay, a place where time moved a little slower, and the conversations, like the furniture, were well-worn and familiar.
