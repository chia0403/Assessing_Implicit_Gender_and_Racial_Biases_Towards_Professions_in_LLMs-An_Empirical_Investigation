## The Setting:

The year is 2247. Old Shanghai, a sprawling megacity built atop the ruins of its ancient predecessor, is a chaotic tapestry woven from neon-drenched skyscrapers, sprawling bio-domes choked with genetically modified flora, and crumbling concrete tenements that cling to life in the shadows. Hovercars whiz through designated airways, leaving trails of shimmering condensation, while street vendors hawk synthetic delicacies and cybernetic enhancements from makeshift stalls below. The air hums with the constant thrum of the city's bio-engines, a blend of recycled waste and manufactured life that keeps the metropolis breathing. Pollution is a constant, a gritty film that coats everything, but the city's inhabitants are resilient, adapted to its harsh realities.

The specific locale is a particularly dilapidated district known as the "Fractured Quarter," a warren of narrow alleys and collapsing buildings where the law barely dares to tread. Here, amidst the detritus of forgotten technology and discarded dreams, humanity clings to the fringes, augmented or otherwise, forging a desperate existence.

## The Opening:

The flickering neon sign above the entrance to "Dr. Anya Sharma's Clinic - Healing & Hope (Limited)" buzzed erratically, threatening to short-circuit and plunge the alley into darkness. Anya, clad in her worn and stained white coat, meticulously stitched closed a ragged gash on the arm of a hulking, cybernetically enhanced man who went by the name "Brick." Brick, his skin patched with scarred metal and flickering LED lights, winced only slightly. Anya, however, felt the familiar tremor in her hands, a symptom of prolonged sleep deprivation and the gnawing hunger that was a constant companion.

"Hold still, Brick," she said, her voice raspy from the recycled air and the countless arguments she’d had with the district’s various gang leaders. "Almost done. And try to stay out of knife fights for a week, yeah?"

Brick grunted, a sound that could either be agreement or pain. Anya didn't bother to decipher it. She'd learned long ago that in the Fractured Quarter, you took what you could get. Just another night in Old Shanghai. Just another life hanging in the balance under the sickly glow of a failing neon sign.
