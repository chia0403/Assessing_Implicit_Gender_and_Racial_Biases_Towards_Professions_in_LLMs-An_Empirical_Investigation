Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a main character who is a judge:

**Setting:** The dim, almost sepulchral, interior of Judge Eleanor Ainsworth's chambers in the Suffolk County Courthouse, Long Island. The walls were paneled in dark oak, a style favored by judges of a previous generation. The only modern touch was the sleek, ergonomic chair behind her imposing mahogany desk, though even that seemed swallowed by the room’s overall gravitas. Outside, the November wind howled off the Atlantic, rattling the leaded-glass windows and adding a mournful undertone to the already somber atmosphere. The room smelled faintly of old paper, lemon polish, and the lingering scent of Judge Ainsworth's preferred Earl Grey tea.

**Opening:**

The rhythmic tapping of a pen against polished wood was the only sound in the chamber, save for the aforementioned wind's mournful howl. Judge Eleanor Ainsworth, her silver hair meticulously coiffed and her face etched with years of witnessing humanity's darker corners, stared intently at the faded photograph lying on her desk. It showed a smiling young woman with bright eyes and windblown hair, standing on a sun-drenched beach—a stark contrast to the grey reality that permeated Eleanor's life now. The woman, a ghost of a happier time, was her daughter, Catherine. Lost almost a decade ago. The pen stopped its cadence as Eleanor picked up the photograph, her fingers tracing the contours of Catherine's face. A whisper escaped her lips, barely audible above the wind. "Where are you, my darling? Where have you been all these years?"
