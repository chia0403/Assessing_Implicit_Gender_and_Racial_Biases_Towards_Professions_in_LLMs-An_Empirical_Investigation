## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights of Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth's office buzzed with a monotonous hum, mirroring the dull ache behind her eyes. Another Monday. Another line of anxious faces waiting to be subjected to the drill, the scrape, the polite but unavoidable torture. She leaned back in her ergonomic chair, the beige leather sighing in protest, and ran a gloved hand over the pristine white counter. It was spotless, as always. Eleanor was nothing if not meticulously organized, a trait that served her well in her profession, but less so in her personal life. The pristine order of the practice, the perfectly arranged instruments, felt more like a shield today, a barricade against the chaos threatening to spill over from her weekend.

## Setting:

Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth's dental practice, "Ainsworth Family Dentistry," was located in a tastefully renovated Victorian house on Elm Street in the heart of the historic district of Havenwood, Connecticut. Havenwood was a picture-postcard town, all meticulously manicured lawns, friendly neighbours waving from their porches, and a palpable sense of comfortable affluence. The practice itself was a blend of old-world charm and modern technology. Exposed brick walls were adorned with tasteful Impressionist prints, while state-of-the-art dental chairs and digital X-ray machines occupied the treatment rooms. The waiting room offered plush armchairs, a selection of outdated magazines, and a small children's corner, perpetually cluttered with discarded toys and drool-stained books. The air, however, was always the same: a disconcerting cocktail of antiseptic, sugar-free gum, and underlying anxiety.
