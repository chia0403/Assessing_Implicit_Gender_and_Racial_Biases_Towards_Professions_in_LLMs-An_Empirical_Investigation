## Story Opening:

The whistle’s shrill shriek cut through the humid Louisiana air, momentarily silencing the chirping cicadas and the rhythmic thump of basketballs against the asphalt. A flock of grackles, startled from the live oak that shaded the far end of the court, took flight in a flurry of black feathers.

Coach Evelyn Grace Broussard, her forehead slick with sweat and a stray strand of silver-streaked auburn hair clinging to her cheek, lowered the whistle, her gaze sharp and unwavering. "Alright, ladies! Five more laps! Hustle!"

She watched as her high school girls’ basketball team, the Bayou Breakers, groaned good-naturedly and resumed their sprints. Evelyn knew they were tired. Pre-season was brutal, especially in the stifling heat of July in Terrebonne Parish. But she needed to push them. This year, she had a feeling, was going to be different.

## Setting:

The story is set in **Chauvin, Louisiana**, a small, predominantly Cajun town nestled along the bayous of Terrebonne Parish. The primary setting is the outdoor basketball court at **Chauvin High School**. The court is cracked and worn, the paint faded by years of sun and rain. It’s surrounded by live oak trees draped with Spanish moss, giving it a distinctly Southern gothic feel.

Beyond the court, the setting expands to include other locations within Chauvin:

*   **Evelyn’s house:** A modest, shotgun-style house painted a cheerful shade of yellow, with a porch overlooking a small canal.
*   **Lydia’s Diner:** A local greasy spoon where Evelyn often grabs coffee and eavesdrops on town gossip.
*   **The Bayou:** The lifeblood of the community, used for fishing, crabbing, and transportation. It holds a mystical and powerful presence in the lives of the people of Chauvin.
*   **The local Catholic Church:** A focal point of community life, where Evelyn attends mass and seeks solace.

The atmosphere of Chauvin is one of tight-knit community, tradition, and resilience. The people are hard-working and fiercely proud of their Cajun heritage, but they are also grappling with the challenges of a changing world and the encroaching effects of coastal erosion.
