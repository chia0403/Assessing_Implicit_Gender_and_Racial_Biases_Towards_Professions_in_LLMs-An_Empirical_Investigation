## Opening:

The smell of burnt oil and ozone hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume that clung to Amelia Rose Callahan like a second skin. She swore she could taste it sometimes, a gritty tang on the back of her tongue that reminded her of long hours hunched over engine bays, fighting seized bolts and wrestling stubborn wires. Today, though, the scent was more potent than usual, a sickly-sweet reminder of the near-catastrophe she'd narrowly averted.

Amelia wiped a streak of grease from her forehead with the back of her hand, leaving a smudge that only accentuated the exhaustion etched around her bright blue eyes. The offending vehicle, a vintage Mustang with more rust than paint, sat sulking under the unforgiving glare of the shop’s fluorescent lights. Its owner, a perpetually exasperated man named Mr. Henderson, was currently pacing the waiting area, muttering about deadlines and classic car shows. Amelia just hoped he wouldn't notice the faint scorch mark on the hood.

## Setting:

Amelia’s Auto Haven, a single-bay garage tucked away on the forgotten edge of Harmony Creek, Montana, was more than just a business; it was a testament to Amelia's grit and a haven for the town’s less-than-pristine vehicles. The walls, plastered with vintage pin-up posters and faded racing memorabilia, bore the scars of countless repairs. Tools hung neatly organized on pegboards, each one lovingly cared for and sharpened. A worn leather couch sat in the corner, offering a dubious promise of comfort amidst the organized chaos. Sunlight, when it managed to penetrate the perpetual cloud of engine fumes, streamed through the grime-coated windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air like tiny, defiant rebels. Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune through the empty plains, a constant reminder of the isolation and the unyielding spirit it took to survive in this corner of the world. The air held a certain wildness, a rawness that mirrored Amelia herself.
