The relentless chirp of cicadas was Olivia Marie Dubois’s personal soundtrack to the last week of summer. As she sat at her ancient oak desk, nestled in the otherwise sterile confines of Room 2B at Meadowbrook Elementary, it felt as if they were taunting her. *Buzz, buzz, buzz, enjoy your freedom, we’re almost gone, buzz, buzz, back to the chalk dust!*

Room 2B, her classroom and her refuge, was a far cry from the pristine, Instagram-worthy classrooms Olivia scrolled through on Pinterest. Its walls were painted a sickly shade of pale yellow that always reminded her of diluted lemon curd. The linoleum floor was patched and stained, a testament to the generations of sticky fingers and spilled juice boxes that had passed through its doors. But Olivia had done her best to imbue the space with warmth. Colorful paper chains hung haphazardly from the ceiling, a leftover project from last year’s end-of-year celebration. A collection of well-loved children’s books, spines cracked and pages dog-eared, lined the shelves under the windows, beckoning young minds to get lost within their pages. A half-finished alphabet chart, meticulously crafted with pictures representing each letter, leaned against the chalkboard, a promise of the learning that was about to begin. And on the bulletin board, a scattering of postcards from places far and wide - the Eiffel Tower, the Grand Canyon, the Great Barrier Reef – served as a visual reminder of the boundless possibilities that lay beyond the borders of Meadowbrook and the small, sleepy town of Harmony Creek, Ohio.
