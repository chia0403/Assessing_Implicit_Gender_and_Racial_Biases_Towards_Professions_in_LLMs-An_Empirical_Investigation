Okay, here's a story opening and setting, keeping in mind the main character is a real estate agent:

**Setting:** The late afternoon sun, thick and orange, bled across the manicured lawns of Willow Creek Estates, a high-end development just outside of Asheville, North Carolina. The air, usually crisp and mountain-fresh, hung heavy with the scent of cut grass and the lingering aroma of fertilizer. A light breeze rustled the leaves of the perfectly spaced dogwood trees that lined the wide, curving streets.

**Opening:**

"Another 'no,' another freshly baked cookie wasted," lamented Beatrice Eleanor Abernathy, her voice a soft, honeyed drawl that often charmed potential buyers. She sighed, holding the plate of pecan sandies – a local bakery specialty – a little too tightly. The crumbs clung to her perfectly manicured, coral-painted nails. She stood in the doorway of 32 Willow Creek Drive, a sprawling brick colonial with a fountain in the front yard that stubbornly refused to work despite multiple repairs. It was the third showing of the day, and like the previous two, the prospective buyers had politely, but firmly, declined. Beatrice knew the problem wasn't the house; with its gourmet kitchen, five bedrooms, and a view that stretched all the way to the Blue Ridge Mountains, it should have been snapped up weeks ago. The problem, she suspected, was her reputation. Or rather, the whispers that followed it like a shadow. After all, in a town as tight-knit as Asheville, secrets – and rumors – had a way of clinging tighter than kudzu. And Beatrice Eleanor Abernathy had a secret, or at least, that's what they called it. Beatrice preferred to think of it as a… talent.
