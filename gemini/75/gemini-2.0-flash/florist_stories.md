## Opening:

The scent of lilies, a sweet, cloying fragrance that reminded Eleanor Beatrice Ainsworth of funerals and forgotten birthdays, hung heavy in the air. It always did on Thursdays, Lily Day at "Petals & Prose," Eleanor’s small, independent florist shop nestled on the quiet, cobbled street of Elderberry Row. She loved lilies, she truly did, their elegant trumpets reaching for the light, but their scent…well, it was a job hazard. Today, however, the lilies weren't the primary source of her unease. It was the phone ringing - that infernal, insistent chirp that seemed to vibrate directly into her skull.

Eleanor hesitated, her hand hovering above the receiver. Usually, a Thursday morning call was a mundane affair – someone ordering a sympathy arrangement, a last-minute anniversary bouquet, or the dreaded price comparison from Mrs. Periwinkle down the street, who treated Eleanor’s artistic creations like she was haggling for tomatoes at the farmer's market. But today, the air felt different, charged with a strange, almost unsettling energy. She took a deep breath, the lily scent doing little to calm her frayed nerves.  "Petals & Prose, Eleanor speaking," she said, forcing a cheerful tone into her voice that felt as fragile as the petals she arranged.

## Setting:

**Elderberry Row**, a street seemingly plucked from a Victorian storybook, was a haven of small, independent businesses. Cobblestone streets, lined with gas lamps that still flickered on at dusk, wound through two blocks of carefully preserved architecture. Here, you could find a baker whose bread was legendary, a bookstore with shelves overflowing with forgotten tomes, and, of course, Eleanor's "Petals & Prose."

**"Petals & Prose,"** owned and operated by Eleanor Ainsworth, was a riot of color and scent, a fragrant oasis nestled between a dusty antique shop and a tea room known for its gossiping clientele. The shopfront was painted a cheerful, robin's egg blue, with window boxes overflowing with cascading petunias and pansies. Inside, the air was thick with the perfume of roses, jasmine, and, on Thursdays, the ubiquitous lilies. Vases of all shapes and sizes held a vibrant collection of blooms, from delicate orchids to cheerful sunflowers. Bookshelves, crammed with poetry collections and novels about love and loss, lined the back wall, a testament to Eleanor’s other passion. The counter, made of reclaimed wood, was always adorned with a small, hand-tied bouquet, a welcoming gesture to every customer who crossed the threshold.  It was a cozy, inviting space, a haven for those seeking beauty and solace in the heart of the old town.
