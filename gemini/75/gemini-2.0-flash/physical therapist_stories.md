## Story Opening:

The rhythmic hum of the overhead fluorescent lights was a constant, almost comforting presence in the otherwise silent gym at the Evergreen Rehabilitation Center. Dr. Eleanor Amelia Finch, DPT, winced, her own back protesting after a long morning spent coaxing a semblance of movement from limbs that stubbornly refused to cooperate. She wiped a stray bead of sweat from her forehead with the back of her hand, leaving a faint smudge of antiseptic cream there. Outside, the late afternoon sun slanted through the dusty window, casting long, distorted shadows of the parallel bars and weight machines across the polished floor. But Eleanor’s attention was focused solely on the file in her hand: John Abernathy, age 78, right hip replacement, a man whose recovery was proving…challenging.

## Setting:

The Evergreen Rehabilitation Center, located in the quiet, slightly rundown district of Old Willow Creek, Washington, was a place of hope and frustration, of painstaking progress and heartbreaking setbacks. It was a brick building, built in the 1950s, with a vaguely institutional feel. The interior was a patchwork of linoleum floors, pastel-colored walls desperately trying to appear cheerful, and a lingering scent of disinfectant that clung to everything. The main gym, where Eleanor spent most of her days, was a large, open space filled with a variety of exercise equipment: treadmills, stationary bikes, weight machines, parallel bars, and shelves overflowing with resistance bands and foam rollers. Smaller, more private rooms were used for individual treatments and consultations. A small, cluttered office, shared by Eleanor and two other therapists, served as their sanctuary, a place to grab a quick cup of lukewarm coffee and commiserate about the day's challenges. Outside, a small, overgrown garden offered a meager respite for patients and staff alike, a place to breathe in some fresh air and contemplate the slow, often arduous, journey to recovery.
