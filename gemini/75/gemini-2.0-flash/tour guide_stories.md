Okay, here's a story opening with a main character who is a tour guide, along with the setting:

**Story Opening:**

The humid air hung thick and heavy, a scented blanket woven with the fragrance of frangipani and diesel fumes. Rain threatened, pregnant in the bruised purple clouds that swirled above the ancient city. Genevieve "Gen" Dubois, clipboard tucked firmly under her arm and microphone headset already perched jauntily on her head, felt a familiar prickle of anxiety.  Rain meant tourists huddled under inadequate umbrellas, complaining about ruined photo opportunities and generally making her job ten times harder.

She surveyed the gaggle of faces – eager, bored, sunburned, confused – all staring back at her with the expectation that she, a humble tour guide, possessed the key to unlocking the mysteries of Phnom Penh.

"Good morning, everyone!" Gen chirped, her voice amplified and echoing slightly off the crumbling facade of the Royal Palace. "Welcome to Phnom Penh! My name is Genevieve Dubois, but please, call me Gen. I'll be your guide for the next four hours as we explore the heart of this vibrant and complex city." She plastered on her most enthusiastic smile, hoping to inject a bit of sunshine into the pre-storm gloom.  "Today, we'll be delving into the history and culture of Cambodia, from its golden age to its recent, painful past. Prepare to be amazed, intrigued, and perhaps even a little bit moved."

She cleared her throat, adjusting her headset.  A bead of sweat trickled down her temple. This was it.  Showtime.  She just hoped this group wasn't one of *those* groups.

**Setting:**

**Location:**  Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Specifically, the story opens just outside the Royal Palace, a major landmark and tourist attraction. The date is mid-morning, sometime in the rainy season (likely between May and October, but let's say it's early September for the purposes of the story).

**Atmosphere:** Hot, humid, and threatening rain. The air is filled with the sounds of traffic (tuk-tuks, motorbikes, honking cars), street vendors hawking their wares, and snippets of Khmer being spoken. The visual landscape is a mix of grandeur (the Royal Palace with its golden spires) and decay (crumbling colonial-era buildings, dusty streets). There is a palpable sense of history, both beautiful and tragic, hanging in the air.
