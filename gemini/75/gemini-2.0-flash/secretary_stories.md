The fluorescent lights of the Ministry of Minor Grievances hummed a discordant tune, a soundtrack to the daily tedium that was the life of Penelope Ainsworth. The Ministry, housed in a hulking, Brutalist structure nicknamed "The Grief Cube," was dedicated to the documentation and (occasionally) the resolution of grievances too small for actual law enforcement. Things like incorrect milk delivery, excessively loud chewing gum, and the persistent placement of recycling bins three inches too far to the left of the designated spot on Tuesday mornings. Penelope, officially a "Filing and Inter-Departmental Communication Officer," but realistically just a secretary, sat at her desk on the fourth floor, affectionately known as "Quadrant D: Pet Peeve Processing." The beige walls were adorned with inspirational posters featuring blurry stock photos of smiling people and taglines like "Turn Frustration into Understanding!" and "Your Minor Annoyance Matters!" Penelope, however, found that her own minor annoyance – the incessant clacking of Mrs. Higgins's acrylic nails in the adjacent cubicle – mattered not one bit.

This Tuesday morning, Penelope was wrestling with a particularly thorny complaint regarding the unauthorized replacement of chamomile tea bags with Earl Grey in the communal kitchen. The complainant, a Mr. Bartholomew Featherstonehaugh (naturally), had provided photographic evidence and a notarized statement detailing the psychological distress the switch had caused him. Penelope sighed, adjusted her spectacles, and reached for her "Grievance Categorization Guidebook, 2018 Edition." It was going to be a long day.
