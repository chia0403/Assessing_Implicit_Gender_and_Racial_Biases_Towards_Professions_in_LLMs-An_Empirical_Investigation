Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a dental hygienist as the main character:

**Story Opening:**

The squeal of the ultrasonic scaler was, for Imogen Magnolia Finch, a siren song. Not a literal one, of course. More like the internal alert system that kicked in every time she heard that particular high-pitched whine and knew it was time to get to work. This morning, however, the sound was grating more than usual. Maybe it was the leftover stress from last night's disastrous attempt at a blind date (he talked, *only* talked, about competitive birdwatching), or maybe it was the grim realization that she was about to spend the next eight hours elbow-deep in the oral landscapes of strangers. Whatever it was, Imogen took a deep, calming breath, adjusted the overhead light, and pasted on her most reassuring smile. "Good morning, Mr. Henderson!" she chirped, mentally preparing herself for the plaque-encrusted Everest she suspected lay ahead.

**Setting:**

The story primarily takes place in "The Gleaming Grin Dental Clinic," a small, privately-owned practice located in the charming, if somewhat sleepy, town of Willow Creek, nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. The clinic is run by Dr. Theodore "Teddy" Bartholomew, a perpetually cheerful, if occasionally oblivious, dentist. The décor is aggressively cheerful: pastel walls adorned with stock photos of impossibly bright smiles, motivational posters extolling the virtues of flossing, and a waiting room overflowing with outdated magazines and a fish tank populated by remarkably bored-looking goldfish. Imogen's hygiene bay, Station Three, is her domain. It’s a compact space, but she’s tried to personalize it with a small succulent on the counter and a carefully curated selection of calming nature sounds piped through the speakers (though Dr. Bartholomew occasionally overrides it with his preferred polka playlist). The overall atmosphere is intended to be comforting, but the lingering scent of antiseptic and the ever-present hum of dental machinery often undermine that intention.
