The scent of Elmer's glue and freshly-sharpened crayons hung heavy in the air, a comforting, if somewhat headache-inducing, perfume that greeted Miss Eleanor Rose Hawthorne every morning. Inside her classroom, affectionately nicknamed "The Bumblebee Hive" by Principal Thompson due to its constant, buzzing activity, chaos reigned, a beautiful, creative chaos that Eleanor orchestrated with the grace of a seasoned conductor. Five-year-olds were meticulously (or not so meticulously) gluing glitter onto construction paper butterflies, singing off-key renditions of "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star," and engaged in a heated debate over the proper shade of blue to paint a particularly grumpy-looking papier-mâché dog. It was Tuesday, and in the world of Room 4 at Sunny Meadow Elementary, Tuesday was officially "Art-pocalypse Day."
