Okay, here's a story opening and setting, including a main character who is a school psychologist:

**Setting:**

The air in Harmony Creek Elementary was thick with the scent of stale coffee and disinfectant. The beige linoleum floors, polished to a dull sheen, reflected the weak November sunlight filtering through the frosted windows. Outside, a restless wind rattled the skeletal branches of the maple trees lining the playground, promising the first snow of the season. Harmony Creek, despite its idyllic name, was a place where problems fermented under a veneer of forced politeness and bake sale smiles.

**Opening:**

Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Ainsworth sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. The buzzing fluorescent lights of her cramped office seemed to amplify the knot of anxiety tightening in her chest. It was Monday morning, the start of another week at Harmony Creek, and already her inbox overflowed with referrals. A suspected case of neglect in Mrs. Peterson's third grade, escalating bullying incidents in the fifth, and the ongoing saga of Timmy Miller, a second-grader who insisted he was a unicorn trapped in a human body. Ellie took a long swig of her lukewarm coffee, the bitter liquid doing little to soothe her frayed nerves. She knew, as she always did, that behind each referral lay a child struggling, a family unraveling, and a community grappling with its own hidden wounds. She just hoped she had the strength to stitch it all back together, one carefully placed thread at a time. The first appointment of the day was a parent meeting with the Bradshaws, whose son, little Billy, had been caught setting fire to the gerbil cage in the back of the class. "Oh, this is going to be a long week." Ellie muttered to herself.
