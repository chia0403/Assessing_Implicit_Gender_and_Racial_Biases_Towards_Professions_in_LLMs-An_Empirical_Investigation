## Story Opening:

The thrumming bass of the idling helicopter vibrated through Penelope Evelyn Hayes' bones, a counterpoint to the frantic drumming of her anxiety. She gripped the leather armrest, the scent of expensive polish doing little to soothe her frayed nerves. Below, the sprawling emerald green of the Scottish Highlands stretched out like an invitation to a life she wasn't sure she even wanted.

Her phone buzzed, a shrill interruption of the drone of the rotors. Ignoring the call – it was undoubtedly another panicked email from Marketing – she focused instead on the rapidly approaching estate. Craig Inverary Castle, its granite walls softened by centuries of weathering, rose majestically from the loch, a stark contrast to the sleek, glass-and-steel headquarters of GlobalCorp back in Manhattan.

Penelope had been summoned here, to this remote corner of the world, not for a business meeting, not for a strategic takeover, but for something far more terrifying: family.
## Setting:

The primary setting is the **Craig Inverary Castle**, a sprawling and ancient estate nestled in the Scottish Highlands, near the banks of a vast and misty loch. The castle itself is a blend of architectural styles, reflecting centuries of additions and renovations. Imagine thick granite walls softened by ivy, turrets reaching towards the perpetually grey sky, and hidden courtyards filled with the whisper of wind and the scent of damp earth.

Inside, the castle is a mixture of opulent grandeur and faded glory. Grand halls boast intricate tapestries and suits of armour, while other rooms are filled with dusty antiques and portraits of stern-faced ancestors. Modern amenities have been discreetly integrated, like Wi-Fi and central heating, but they do little to dispel the sense of stepping back in time.

The surrounding landscape is equally important. The wild, untamed beauty of the Highlands, with its rolling hills, heather-covered moors, and deep, mysterious lochs, serves as a stark contrast to Penelope's usual urban environment and mirrors the internal conflict she experiences. The weather is changeable, often shifting from bright sunshine to swirling mist and rain within a matter of hours. The remoteness of the location contributes to the feeling of isolation and confinement.
