The pre-dawn chill bit at Elias Thorne's cheeks as he unlocked the bakery's heavy oak door.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single bare bulb hanging overhead, danced in the still air of "Thorne's Treats," a haven of yeasty warmth and sugared dreams nestled on the cobbled side street of Willow Creek.  The town itself was a picture postcard of quaint charm, all rambling ivy-covered houses and sleepy gaslights, but Elias knew the quiet fa√ßade hid a simmering undercurrent of secrets and rivalries, a truth reflected in the complex flavours he coaxed from his ovens.  The scent of freshly baked sourdough, sharp and comforting, mingled with the faint, almost imperceptible aroma of woodsmoke from the nearby hills, a daily reminder of the wildness that lay just beyond the town's meticulously manicured edges.
