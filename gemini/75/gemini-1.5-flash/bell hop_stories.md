The brass spittoon gleamed under the sickly yellow gaslight, reflecting the grime clinging to the mahogany counter of the Grand Majestic Hotel.  Rain lashed against the arched windows, a relentless percussion against the opulent, yet decaying, grandeur within.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale cigars, cheap perfume, and something faintly metallic – the ever-present whisper of the city's underbelly seeping into even the most gilded of establishments.  Twenty-year-old Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, a bellhop whose uniform was more faded than crisp, wrestled a mountain of luggage – a ludicrously oversized steamer trunk overflowing with what sounded suspiciously like rattling bones – onto the rickety baggage cart. The weight threatened to buckle his already straining knees, a familiar ache he'd come to accept as a badge of honor in his less-than-glamorous profession.  Tonight, however, felt different.  The usual symphony of the hotel – the clinking of ice, the murmur of hushed conversations, the distant clatter of kitchen pans – was muted, replaced by an unsettling silence that prickled at the edges of Barty's skin.
