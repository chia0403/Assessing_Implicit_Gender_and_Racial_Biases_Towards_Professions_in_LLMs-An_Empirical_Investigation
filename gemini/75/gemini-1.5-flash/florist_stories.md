The scent of lilies, heady and almost cloying, hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the damp chill clinging to the cobblestones outside.  Rain lashed against the leaded windows of "Petals & Promises," blurring the already fading autumn light.  Inside, amidst a riot of colour – fiery chrysanthemums, deep purple asters, and the last defiant blooms of summer roses –  Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne, owner and sole proprietor, meticulously arranged a funeral wreath.  Her fingers, stained a delicate shade of saffron from handling marigolds, moved with practiced grace, weaving together the somber blooms into a circle of mourning. The bell above the door jingled, a sharp metallic sound cutting through the quiet hum of the shop, heralding the arrival of whoever would break the spell of Amelia's melancholic creation.
