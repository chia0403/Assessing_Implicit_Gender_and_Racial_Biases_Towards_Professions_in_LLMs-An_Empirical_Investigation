The biting wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vance’s auburn braid across her face as she wrestled the stubborn key into the lock of her clinic.  Snow, thick and relentless, piled high against the frosted-glass windows of “Vance Dental,” obscuring the already bleak December landscape of the small, isolated town of Havenwood.
