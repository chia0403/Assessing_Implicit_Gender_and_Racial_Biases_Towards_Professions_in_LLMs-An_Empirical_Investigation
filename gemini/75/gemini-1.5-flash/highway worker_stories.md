The sun beat down on Elias Thorne's neck, turning the sweat already beading on his forehead into a glistening river that trickled down his sun-weathered face.  He squinted, the glare reflecting off the shimmering asphalt of Interstate 40, a ribbon of black snaking across the vast, unforgiving landscape of the New Mexico desert.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of red earth, danced on the horizon, their fleeting existence mirrored in the brief, frantic bursts of activity around him.  This stretch of I-40, a desolate expanse between Albuquerque and Gallup, was Elias’s kingdom – or more accurately, his purgatory.  For the past ten years, he'd been patching potholes, fixing guardrails, and generally keeping the artery of the Southwest from collapsing under the weight of eighteen-wheelers and impatient tourists.  Today, the heat was particularly brutal, even by New Mexico standards, and the air hung thick and heavy with the scent of sagebrush and something faintly metallic, a smell Elias knew all too well – the scent of impending disaster.
