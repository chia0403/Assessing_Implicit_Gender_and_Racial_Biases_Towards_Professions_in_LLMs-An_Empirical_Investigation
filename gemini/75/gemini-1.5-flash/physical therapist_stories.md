The salt spray stung Dr. Eleanor Vance’s face as she wrestled the stubborn fishing net free from the barnacle-encrusted pilings.  The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum sinking towards the churning grey Atlantic, cast long shadows across the weathered planks of the wharf in Port Blossom, Maine.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and decaying seaweed, carried the mournful cry of gulls overhead.  Eleanor, her hands raw and chapped despite the thick gloves, finally freed the net, letting it collapse with a sodden thud onto the wooden deck.  It wasn’t exactly the kind of physical therapy she was trained for, but helping old Captain Silas salvage his gear was part of the unwritten job description of being the only physical therapist in a town where everyone knew your business, and everyone, it seemed, needed your help.
