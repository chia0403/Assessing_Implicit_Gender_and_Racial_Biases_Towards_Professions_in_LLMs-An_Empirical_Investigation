The rusty sign creaked a mournful tune in the October wind, its faded lettering barely whispering "Bartholomew's Barber Shop."  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of Bay Rum and something indefinably older â€“ dust motes dancing in the single shaft of sunlight that pierced the gloom.  Bartholomew "Barty" Higgins, a man whose age was as indecipherable as the faded floral wallpaper clinging to the walls, meticulously honed the edge of his straight razor on a worn leather strop. The rhythmic scrape was the only sound besides the whisper of the wind and the occasional groan from the ancient barber chair, its worn leather groaning under the weight of years and countless behinds.  Barty, with his gnarled fingers and eyes the color of faded denim, wasn't just a barber; he was a custodian of secrets, a silent observer of the lives that unfolded within the confines of his small, dusty shop nestled on the edge of the forgotten town of Oakhaven.
