The chipped paint of the "Welcome to Ms. Eleanor Vance's Class!" sign flaked onto the vibrant, slightly sticky, floor of Room 2B like a gentle, colorful snow.  It was a Tuesday, and the air hung thick with the aroma of impending naptime â€“ a heady mix of peanut butter, slightly sour milk, and the ever-present faint scent of crayons that seemed permanently embedded in the very fabric of the school.  Outside, the late October wind howled a mournful tune against the rattling windows of Willow Creek Elementary, but inside, the chaotic symphony of twenty-five five-year-olds was far louder, a cacophony of tiny voices demanding attention, singing off-key, and occasionally erupting in the kind of joyous shriek only a group of toddlers can produce.  Ms. Eleanor Vance, however, remained remarkably calm, her smile a steady beacon amidst the storm of glitter glue and misplaced shoes.
