The grease-stained overalls of Elias Thorne felt like a second skin, a comforting weight against the biting November wind that whipped through the open bay doors of Thorne's Auto Repair.  Rust-colored leaves, swirling like miniature tornadoes, plastered themselves against the grimy windows of his small, family-run shop nestled on the edge of Harmony Creek, a town so quiet the only sounds usually came from the rhythmic clang of his wrench and the occasional mournful sigh of the old oak tree that stood sentinel across the street.  The air hung thick with the familiar scent of engine oil, burnt coffee, and the faint, metallic tang of something Elias couldn't quite place â€“ a smell that hinted at trouble, a smell that promised a long night.
