The scent of aged paper and leather, a perfume both comforting and subtly melancholic, hung heavy in the air of the Grand Blackwood Library. Dust motes, illuminated by the afternoon sun slanting through the tall, arched windows, danced in the stillness.  Eleanor Vance, a woman whose life had become as intricately layered as the Dewey Decimal System itself, adjusted the spectacles perched on her nose.  Outside, the relentless November rain hammered against the stained-glass depicting a mythical griffin, a creature as elusive and fantastical as the very book she held clutched in her gloved hands â€“ a first edition of *The Lost City of Eldoria*, rumored to contain a map leading to a hidden civilization.  The library, a sprawling Gothic masterpiece nestled amongst the whispering pines of Blackwood Manor, was more than just a repository of knowledge; it was a sanctuary, a labyrinth, and tonight, perhaps, a gateway.
