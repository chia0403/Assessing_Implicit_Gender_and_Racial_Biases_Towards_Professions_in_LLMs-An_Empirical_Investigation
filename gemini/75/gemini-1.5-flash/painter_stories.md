Her weathered canvas, still pristine white, awaited the explosion of colour she envisioned â€“ a tempestuous rendering of the sea, mirroring the turmoil she felt within.  This remote cove, nestled between towering granite headlands, was her sanctuary, a place where the roar of the ocean drowned out the whispers of doubt that haunted her city studio.
