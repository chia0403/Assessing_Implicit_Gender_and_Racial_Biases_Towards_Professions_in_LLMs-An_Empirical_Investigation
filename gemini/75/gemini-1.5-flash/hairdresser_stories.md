The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume unique to Seraphina “Sera” Bellweather’s salon.  Rain lashed against the mismatched windowpanes of “Shear Bliss,” a tiny, almost hidden gem tucked away on a cobbled side street in the ancient port city of Porthaven.  The streetlamps, struggling against the downpour, cast a flickering, yellow light on the weathered brick buildings, their facades slick with rain and reflecting the city’s melancholic mood. Inside, however, the salon hummed with a low, comforting buzz – the whir of the hairdryer, the snip-snip of scissors, and the murmur of Sera’s soothing voice, as she expertly coaxed a stubborn curl into submission.
