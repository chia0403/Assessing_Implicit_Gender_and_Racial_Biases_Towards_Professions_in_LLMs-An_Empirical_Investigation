The biting November wind whipped Elias Thorne's already-chapped lips raw as he wrestled a length of weathered cedar shingle into place.  Below him, the city of Oakhaven sprawled, a patchwork quilt of red brick and grey slate, stitched together by the snaking ribbon of the Ash River.  The air, thick with the scent of woodsmoke and decaying leaves, carried the faint, metallic tang of rain – a rain that promised to turn the already treacherous rooftop into a skating rink. Elias, perched precariously on the gabled peak of a Victorian mansion, barely noticed.  He was lost in the rhythmic clang of his hammer, a counterpoint to the mournful sigh of the wind whistling through the decaying eaves.  The job – repairing the storm damage to Mrs. Gable’s roof – was tedious, but familiar; the view, breathtaking, but predictable.  It was the silence, the unnerving absence of the usual cacophony of the city, that prickled at the edges of Elias’s awareness.  Something was wrong.  Something was very, very wrong.
