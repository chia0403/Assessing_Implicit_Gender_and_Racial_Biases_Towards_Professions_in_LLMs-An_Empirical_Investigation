The biting Antarctic wind howled a mournful song around Dr. Eleanor Vanceâ€™s research station, a lonely outpost clinging precariously to the edge of the ice shelf.  Ice crystals, sharp as shards of glass, stung her exposed cheeks as she wrestled with the recalcitrant satellite dish, its antenna stubbornly refusing to lock onto the geosynchronous orbit.
