The salt spray stung Detective Inspector Ava Thorne's face as the wind howled a mournful dirge across the desolate Cornish coastline.  November’s relentless grey sky mirrored the churning sea below, the waves crashing against the jagged cliffs with a violent energy that mirrored the turmoil in her gut.  The air, thick with the smell of brine and something else…something acrid and faintly metallic… clung to her like a shroud.  She pulled her thick wool coat tighter, the collar scratching against her already chapped cheeks, and stared out at the scene before her: a crumpled fishing boat, half-submerged amongst the rocks, its once vibrant colours now muted and stained a gruesome shade of rust and blood.  The body, partially obscured by a tangle of fishing nets, lay just beyond the reach of the waves, a silent testament to the unforgiving nature of both the sea and, Ava suspected, whoever had left it there.
