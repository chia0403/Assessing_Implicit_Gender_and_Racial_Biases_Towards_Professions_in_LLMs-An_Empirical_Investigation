The salt spray stung Dr. Eleanor Vance’s face as she wrestled the stubborn fishing net onto the small dock.  The setting sun cast long shadows across the weathered pilings of the rickety structure, painting the churning grey water of the Atlantic in fiery hues.  Seagulls cried overhead, their calls a mournful counterpoint to the rhythmic crash of waves against the rocks below.  This wasn't the typical backdrop for a chiropractor's evening, but then again, Eleanor Vance’s life in the remote coastal town of Seabrook, Maine, rarely conformed to expectations.  Her clinic, tucked away above the Seabreeze General Store, smelled less of antiseptic and more of seaweed and the lingering scent of lobster. Tonight, however, the scent of brine and fish was particularly strong, clinging to her clothes like a second skin after a day spent helping her brother, a struggling fisherman, haul in his meager catch.
