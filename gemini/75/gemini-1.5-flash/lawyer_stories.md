The law firm of Dubois and Tremaine occupied the top two floors of this crumbling but undeniably charismatic building, a testament to New Orleans' enduring blend of faded grandeur and vibrant chaos.  Mia, however, found little charm in the peeling paint or the relentless humidity; today, she was wrestling with a case that threatened to unravel her already fragile equilibrium.
