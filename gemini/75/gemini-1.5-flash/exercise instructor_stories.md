The pre-dawn chill bit at Amelia “Amy” Hernandez’s cheeks as she unlocked the gym doors, the metallic clang echoing in the otherwise silent street.  A faint, pearly light painted the eastern sky, promising a sunrise that would soon bathe the city of San Francisco in gold.  Inside, the "Body & Soul Fitness Studio" was a cavern of shadows and dust motes dancing in the weak light filtering through the tall, arched windows.  The air hung heavy with the scent of rubber and sweat – a familiar perfume to Amy, a scent that spoke of early mornings, disciplined bodies, and the quiet satisfaction of pushing limits.  Amy, with her vibrant, waist-length braid and the faint scent of peppermint from her lip balm, was a familiar figure herself in this pre-sunrise sanctuary.  Tonight, however, something felt different.  A subtle unease, like a discordant note in a perfectly tuned symphony, hummed beneath the surface of her usual pre-class routine.
