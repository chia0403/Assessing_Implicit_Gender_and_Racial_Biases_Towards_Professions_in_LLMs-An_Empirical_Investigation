Crayon shavings, remnants of a particularly enthusiastic art project depicting volcanoes, littered the edges of the desks.  The air smelled faintly of glue, old paper, and the lingering sweetness of spilled juice â€“ the familiar, comforting aroma of a classroom that had witnessed a thousand tiny triumphs and countless minor disasters.  Eleanor Vance, a woman whose smile lines spoke of years spent patiently guiding small humans through the labyrinth of learning, sighed contentedly.  It was the end of a long day, but the quiet hum of exhaustion was laced with the quiet satisfaction that came only from a job well-loved.
