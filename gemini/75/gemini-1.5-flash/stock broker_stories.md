The biting November wind whipped Amelia Jean Hawthorne’s tailored cashmere coat around her legs as she hurried across Wall Street, the cacophony of the city a roaring counterpoint to the frantic hammering in her chest.

The scent of roasted chestnuts from a nearby vendor, usually a comforting aroma, did little to ease the knot tightening in her stomach. This wasn't just about money; this was about proving herself, about finally escaping the shadow of her father, a legend on Wall Street whose success felt less like an inspiration and more like an insurmountable mountain.
