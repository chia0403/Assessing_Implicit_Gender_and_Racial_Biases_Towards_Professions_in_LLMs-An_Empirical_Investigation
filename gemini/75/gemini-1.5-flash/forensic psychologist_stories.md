Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes, mirroring the tempest brewing within her.  Evelyn wasn’t just processing a crime scene; she was dissecting a mind, a shattered reflection of the human condition staring back from the blood-soaked carpet.  This wasn't her first case, but something about the chilling precision of the killer's work sent a shiver down her spine, a primal fear that even years of experience couldn't quite quell. The flickering neon sign of the liquor store across the street cast a lurid glow on the rain-slicked street below, offering no solace, no escape from the grim tableau unfolding before her.
