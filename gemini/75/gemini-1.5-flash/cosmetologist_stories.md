The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume only Amelia "Mia" Hernandez truly appreciated.  It was a testament to her long, chaotic day at "Shear Perfection," her bustling salon nestled on the sun-drenched corner of Bleecker Street and Seventh Avenue in Greenwich Village.  Outside, the late afternoon light painted the brick buildings in warm hues, casting long shadows that stretched across the cobblestone street, where a lone street musician was coaxing melancholic notes from a battered saxophone.  Inside, however, the atmosphere was a vibrant whirlwind of chattering clients, the whirring of hairdryers, and the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of Mia's expert shears.  Tonight, though, the usual symphony of the salon was punctuated by the sharp, insistent ringing of the old-fashioned bell above the door, announcing a new arrival â€“ and possibly, Mia suspected, the start of a very unusual night.
