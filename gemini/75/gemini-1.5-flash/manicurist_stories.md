The chipped turquoise paint of Serenity Nails flaked like forgotten dreams under the relentless Florida sun.  Cicadas buzzed a relentless, hypnotic chorus, a soundtrack to the humid afternoon.

Lilac Dubois, owner and operator of Serenity Nails, hummed a slightly off-key rendition of "La Vie en Rose" as she meticulously buffed the already flawless nails of Mrs. Henderson, a woman whose age was as carefully concealed as her meticulously applied ruby red polish.  The small salon, tucked away on a quiet side street in St. Augustine, was usually a haven of calm, a sanctuary from the relentless bustle of tourist season. But today, a storm was brewing, and it had nothing to do with the approaching hurricane.
