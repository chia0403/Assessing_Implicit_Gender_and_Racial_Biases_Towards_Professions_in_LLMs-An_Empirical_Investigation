The chipped Formica countertop felt cold against Elias Thorneâ€™s cheek as he rested his head, the rhythmic clinking of ice against glass a dull counterpoint to the throbbing in his temple.  The air in "The Rusty Mug" hung thick and sweet, a cloying blend of stale beer, spilled bourbon, and the faintly floral scent of cheap perfume clinging to the worn velvet booths.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the neon glow of the "Liquor Store" sign across the street into a hazy, shimmering smear.  Elias, a man whose face bore the roadmap of a life lived mostly in the dim light of such establishments, sighed, the sound lost in the low hum of conversation and the sporadic burst of laughter from a boisterous group huddled in the corner booth. Tonight, however, the laughter felt particularly hollow, echoing the emptiness he felt gnawing at his insides.
