The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Mia” Hawthorne’s thick auburn braid across her face as she wrestled a recalcitrant bale of hay.  The scent of damp earth and pine needles, usually comforting, was overwhelmed tonight by the pungent aroma of wet dog and something faintly…skunky.  Mia shivered, pulling her worn, fleece-lined jacket tighter around her.  She wasn’t just battling the elements at the sprawling Whispering Pines Animal Sanctuary; she was fighting a losing battle against encroaching darkness in the sprawling, overgrown fields behind the main barn. The sanctuary, nestled deep within the redwood forests of Northern California, boasted acres of rescued creatures – from the majestic elk grazing placidly in the distant pasture to the screeching family of orphaned raccoons currently attempting a daring escape from their makeshift enclosure.  Tonight, however, Mia's focus was solely on the unruly hay bale and the distinct feeling that she wasn’t entirely alone.
