The salt spray stung Elias Thorneâ€™s face, a familiar kiss from the unforgiving Atlantic.  He braced himself against the relentless wind, the biting chill seeping through his worn leather jacket despite the multiple layers underneath.  The grey sky mirrored the churning sea, a monochrome canvas that promised nothing but tempestuous weather.  Elias adjusted his battered Nikon F6, its cold metal a comfort in his gloved hands.  He stood perched precariously on the jagged rocks of Kilkee Cliffs, County Clare, Ireland, the wind threatening to rip him from his precarious vantage point.  Below, the waves crashed against the cliffs with a thunderous roar, a symphony of destruction and raw power that Elias, a landscape photographer with a penchant for the dramatic, found both terrifying and intoxicating. Tonight, however, it was more than just the weather that had him on edge.  He was chasing a rumour, a whisper of a fleeting phenomenon, a ghostly green glow said to emanate from the churning waters below... the legendary Green Flash of Kilkee.
