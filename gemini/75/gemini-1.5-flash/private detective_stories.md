The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Jack Hartigan’s office, a relentless percussion that mirrored the throbbing ache behind his eyes.  He rubbed them, leaving smudges of grime and sleep-deprivation on his already-rumpled trench coat.  The single bare bulb hanging precariously above his desk cast long, skeletal shadows across the cramped space, illuminating dust motes dancing in the humid air.  The office itself, perched precariously on the third floor of a crumbling building overlooking the perpetually grimy docks of San Francisco’s Fisherman’s Wharf, smelled faintly of stale cigarettes, cheap coffee, and the lingering scent of brine and diesel.  Outside, the foghorn wailed a mournful song, a mournful counterpoint to the frantic tapping of his fingers on the chipped Formica desk.  Jack Hartigan, private investigator, was waiting.  Waiting for a call that might change everything, or might just add another layer of grime to his already complicated life.
