The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face as he hauled the last crate of ice onto the deck of the *Sea Serpent*.  The wind, a raw, unforgiving beast from the North Atlantic, whipped his apron around him like a frenzied flag.

Elias, despite the chaotic symphony of creaks, groans, and the ceaseless rhythmic thud of the engine, moved with a practiced calm, his hands – calloused, strong, and surprisingly delicate – already sorting through the day's catch: cod, mostly, with a scattering of mackerel and the occasional, prize-winning, silvery herring.  The taste of the coming stew, rich and hearty enough to combat the elements, was already forming in his mind, a comforting counterpoint to the harsh reality of life aboard the *Sea Serpent*.
