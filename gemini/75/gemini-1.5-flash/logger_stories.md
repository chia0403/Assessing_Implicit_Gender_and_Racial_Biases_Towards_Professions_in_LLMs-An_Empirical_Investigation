The biting wind whipped Elias Thorne’s beard across his frost-chapped cheeks, each icy strand a miniature lash against the already raw skin.  He squinted, the rising sun a pale, watery disc struggling to pierce the dense fog clinging to the slopes of Mount Cinder.  The air, thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, carried a deeper, almost metallic tang – the smell of iron and impending snow.  Elias, his breath puffing out in ragged white clouds, leaned heavily on his axe, the worn hickory handle slick with condensation.  He surveyed the towering Douglas firs surrounding him, their colossal trunks draped in a ghostly shroud of mist, their branches burdened with the weight of unshed snow.  This was Blackwood Ridge, a place where the trees clawed at the sky with relentless ambition, and where men, like Elias, wrestled with the wilderness for a living, their lives as precarious as the precarious balance of the ancient forest itself.
