The biting November wind whipped Elias Thorne’s already-chapped lips raw as he wrestled with a recalcitrant oak branch.  Its stubborn grip on the crumbling stone wall of Blackwood Manor was legendary, a testament to the ancient tree’s resilience and the groundskeeper’s increasingly frustrating lack of sufficient leverage.  Blackwood Manor itself hunched over the valley like a brooding gargoyle, its gothic silhouette stark against the bruised purple sky.  Ivy, thick as pythons, snaked across its weathered stone, obscuring crumbling archways and whispering secrets to the wind.  The air hung heavy with the damp scent of decaying leaves and the earthy aroma of the recently turned soil – a familiar comfort to Elias, even on this particularly miserable afternoon.  He adjusted his worn tweed cap, its once-vibrant green now faded to the colour of dried grass, and grunted with exertion, the muscles in his arms screaming in protest.  This branch, he mused, was a fitting metaphor for his own life – stubborn, resistant, and seemingly destined to remain entangled in the complexities of Blackwood.
