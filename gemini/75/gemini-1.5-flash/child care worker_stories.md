The chipped paint of the "Sunshine Daycare" sign flaked onto the overgrown lawn like a forgotten confetti shower.  Rain, a relentless drizzle that had been falling for three days, plastered Amelia Grace Hawthorne's bright yellow raincoat to her thin frame.  She tugged the hood tighter, the dampness seeping through despite its best efforts. Inside, the muffled sounds of tiny voices and the rhythmic thump of plastic blocks provided a surprisingly cheerful counterpoint to the gloom outside.  The aroma of slightly burnt toast and something vaguely resembling cinnamon clung to the air, a comforting, if slightly chaotic, fragrance Amelia associated intimately with her job.  This wasn’t just a daycare; it was a small, slightly damp, eternally slightly messy, and utterly endearing ecosystem of miniature humans, all demanding their share of Amelia's attention – and patience.
