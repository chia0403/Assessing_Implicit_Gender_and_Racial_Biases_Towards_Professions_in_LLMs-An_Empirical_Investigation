The relentless Florida sun beat down on Amelia Hernandez's shoulders, baking the already stifling air inside her beat-up, cherry-red Ford Focus.  Sweat clung to her crisp white linen shirt, a stark contrast to the shimmering turquoise of the Gulf of Mexico visible through the palm trees lining the highway.  Amelia sighed, the scent of salt and sunscreen mingling with the cloying sweetness of hibiscus blooming riotously along the roadside.  She was late, spectacularly late, for a showing on a beachfront property in Pelican Pointe, a gated community so exclusive it felt more like a fortress than a neighborhood.  The house, a Spanish-style monstrosity boasting more balconies than bedrooms, belonged to Mrs. Evangeline Albright, a woman whose reputation for capriciousness preceded her like a hurricane warning.  This wasn't just another sale; this was Ameliaâ€™s shot at proving herself in the notoriously competitive Pelican Pointe market.
