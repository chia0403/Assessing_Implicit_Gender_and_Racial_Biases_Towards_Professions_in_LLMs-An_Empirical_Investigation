The fluorescent lights of Millie’s Tax Service hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the annual symphony of stress that was tax season.  Dust motes danced in the pale light, illuminated like tiny, frantic stars in the otherwise drab office.  Millie Darjeeling, a woman whose neatly-coiffed auburn bun seemed to defy the chaotic energy swirling around her, sat perched on a rolling chair, its wheels squeaking a counterpoint to the humming lights.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee, printer toner, and the faint, almost imperceptible tang of fear – the shared aroma of countless clients wrestling with their financial lives.  Outside, the relentless March wind howled a mournful ballad, mirroring the anxieties brewing within the four walls of Millie's small, but surprisingly busy, tax preparation office in the heart of sleepy, snow-dusted Havenwood, Vermont.
