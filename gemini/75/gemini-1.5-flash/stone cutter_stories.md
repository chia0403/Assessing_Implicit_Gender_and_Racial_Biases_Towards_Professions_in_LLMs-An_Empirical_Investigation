The biting wind whipped Elias Thorne's weathered face, stinging his eyes as he squinted at the grey granite.  Jagged peaks of the Cairngorm Mountains, capped with a fresh dusting of snow, clawed at the bruised purple sky.  Below, the village of Glencoe huddled like a frightened sheepdog, its stone cottages clinging precariously to the steep hillside, a tapestry woven from slate roofs and smoke-stained chimneys.  Elias, his breath misting in the frigid air, ran a calloused hand across the rough surface of the unfinished headstone, the chisel lying abandoned in the snow beside him.  The inscription, barely begun, mocked him with its incompleteness:  *Here liesâ€¦*  The rest remained unwritten, a silent testament to the grief that clung to him like the mountain mist.  The wind howled a mournful dirge through the skeletal branches of the nearby pines, a sound that mirrored the ache in his heart.
