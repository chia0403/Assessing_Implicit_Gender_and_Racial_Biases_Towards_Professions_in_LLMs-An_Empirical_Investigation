The biting November wind whipped Amelia Katherine Blackwood’s hair across her face, stinging her cheeks with icy rain.  She pulled her worn wool scarf tighter, the damp clinging to it like a second skin.  Amelia, or Amy as most people called her, shivered, not entirely from the cold.  The biting wind mirrored the unease churning in her stomach.  She stood before the gargantuan, gothic façade of Blackwood Manor, her ancestral home, a looming testament to generations of artistic triumphs and familial tragedies.  Gargoyles, twisted and grotesque, leered down from the eaves, their stone eyes seeming to follow her every movement.  The manor, perched precariously on a cliff overlooking the churning grey sea, was as dramatic and brooding as the landscape paintings she was known for – a stark contrast to the vibrant, almost feverish colours that exploded on her canvases within its walls.  Tonight, however, the vibrant colours felt absent, replaced by the oppressive greyness of the storm and the chilling weight of expectation.
