The acrid bite of smoke, thick and black as a raven's wing, clawed at Captain Elias Thorne's throat.  His lungs, seasoned veterans of countless blazes, still burned with the familiar protest.  He coughed, the sound swallowed by the roar of the inferno consuming the old Victorian warehouse on Bleecker Street.  Flames, orange and malevolent, danced in the shattered windows, casting flickering shadows that writhed like tormented souls across the grimy brick walls.  The air hung heavy with the stench of burning wood, melting plastic, and something elseâ€¦ something sickeningly sweet, a metallic tang that hinted at something far worse than just a fire.  Tonight, Elias Thorne, a man whose life was measured in seconds and the heat of burning buildings, sensed this was no ordinary blaze.  The city, usually a symphony of sirens and distant shouts, was oddly silent, save for the crackle and roar of the fire itself, a sound that spoke of devastation and untold loss.
