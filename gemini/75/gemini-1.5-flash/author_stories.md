The salt spray stung Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s face, a familiar discomfort she welcomed as a counterpoint to the stifling humidity clinging to the air like a second skin.  Amelia, or Amy as she preferred amongst friends – though few counted themselves amongst her friends these days – gripped the railing of the ferry, the rhythmic chug of the engine a hypnotic beat against the relentless crash of waves against the hull.  The ferry, the *Sea Serpent*,  was a rusty behemoth, its paint peeling like sunburnt skin, groaning its way across the choppy waters separating the mainland from the windswept Isle of Skye.  Amy, however, wasn’t here for the scenic beauty, though the dramatic cliffs and jagged peaks were undeniably breathtaking. She was here for solitude, for escape from the suffocating pressure of a looming deadline and the gnawing emptiness that had taken root in her life since the manuscript rejection that still felt like a fresh wound.  The Isle of Skye, with its brooding atmosphere and fiercely independent spirit, felt like the only place on Earth she might find the clarity to write the next chapter of her life, let alone her next novel.
