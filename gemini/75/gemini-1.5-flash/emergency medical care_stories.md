The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Amy” Hernandez’s dark hair across her face as she wrestled the heavy back door of the ambulance open.  The harsh glare of the sodium vapor streetlights reflected off the slick, rain-streaked asphalt of Riverbend Road, illuminating the scene before her with a sickly yellow hue.

The air hung thick with the scent of woodsmoke and something else, something metallic and sharp that pricked at Amy's nostrils, a scent she knew all too well.  The flashing red and blue lights of her emergency vehicle painted the crumpled remains of a silver sedan in an unsettling strobe effect.  This wasn't just another fender bender; the silence emanating from the wrecked vehicle was a chilling prelude to what Amy knew she was about to face.
