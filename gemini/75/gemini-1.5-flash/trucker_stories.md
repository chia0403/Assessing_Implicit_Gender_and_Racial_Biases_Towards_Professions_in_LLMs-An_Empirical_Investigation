The pre-dawn air hung thick and greasy, smelling of diesel fumes and frying bacon – a familiar, comforting stench to Silas "Si" Blackwood.  He sat hunched in the worn leather seat of his eighteen-wheeler, "The Wandering Moose," its chrome gleaming faintly under the sodium vapor lights of the Truck Stop Oasis.  Rain hammered against the corrugated metal roof, a relentless rhythm that mirrored the drumbeat in his chest.  The Oasis, a sprawling complex of greasy spoons, gas pumps, and weary travelers clinging to the edge of I-40 in the desolate expanse of West Texas, was Si’s temporary haven. Outside, the wind howled a lonely ballad across the flat, unforgiving landscape, a landscape he knew intimately, a landscape that held both beauty and brutality in equal measure.  Tonight, however, the brutality felt a little closer than usual.  The last radio dispatch had sent a shiver down his spine, a cryptic warning about a stretch of highway south of Amarillo, and Si Blackwood, despite years spent battling the elements and the unpredictable nature of the road, felt a knot of unease tighten in his gut.
