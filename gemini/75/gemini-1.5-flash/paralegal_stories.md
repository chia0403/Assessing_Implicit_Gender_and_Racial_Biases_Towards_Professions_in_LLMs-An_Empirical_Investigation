The flickering neon sign of "Benny's Burgers" cast a greasy, orange glow across the rain-slicked street, reflecting in the puddles that mirrored the city’s weary sigh.  A lone figure, hunched against the relentless downpour, huddled deeper into her threadbare trench coat.  This was Amelia Grace Hawthorne, paralegal extraordinaire, or at least, that’s what she told herself as she shivered, the damp chill seeping into her bones.  The air, thick with the scent of exhaust fumes and frying onions, did little to improve her mood.  Amelia’s usual sharp focus was clouded by a gnawing anxiety, a feeling that the seemingly straightforward case she'd been working on for the past three months was about to unravel spectacularly, leaving her, and her boss, in a very sticky situation.  The burger joint, a haven of cheap eats and even cheaper coffee, was her only refuge from the storm – both literal and metaphorical – raging outside and within.
