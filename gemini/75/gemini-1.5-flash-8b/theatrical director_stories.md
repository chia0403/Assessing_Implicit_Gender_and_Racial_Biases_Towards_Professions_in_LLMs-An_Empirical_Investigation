The biting wind howled a mournful dirge against the cracked brick facade of the "Phoenix Theatre," its once vibrant murals now peeling like sunburnt skin.  Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless percussion echoing the tumultuous thoughts swirling within Bartholomew "Barty" Nightingale, the theatre's beleaguered director.  He stood on the rain-slicked cobblestones, a lone figure enveloped in a threadbare overcoat, gazing at the boarded-up stage doors.  Barty, a man whose passion for the dramatic arts burned as fiercely as the city's perpetual twilight, felt the familiar ache of despair settle like a lead weight in his chest.  The Phoenix, once a beacon of artistic brilliance in the city of Ashfall, now languished, a monument to lost dreams and dwindling audiences.  A single, flickering streetlamp cast long, distorted shadows, enhancing the theatre's already dilapidated grandeur and the oppressive sense of futility that clung to the air like the damp chill of the November night.
