The fluorescent lights of the emergency room hummed, a relentless, almost mournful soundtrack to the chaos.  Rain hammered against the windows of the Mercy Medical Center, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Amelia "Amy" Carmichael, a registered nurse with five years of experience under her belt.  But tonight felt different.  Tonight, the storm raged within her, not just around her.

The setting was the bustling, high-pressure environment of a large urban hospital on a particularly stormy night.  The air, thick with the scent of antiseptic and fear, was punctuated by the rhythmic beep-boop of heart monitors and the hushed urgency of medical staff.  The emergency room, normally a whirlwind of activity, seemed to be operating on a higher gear tonight, each gurney and bed a tiny stage for a desperate drama.  Amy, with her perpetually tired eyes and neatly pressed uniform, was already halfway through her third twelve-hour shift, the fatigue weighing on her like a lead apron.
