The fluorescent lights of the "Apex Architectural Designs" office hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Elara Nightingale's workday.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of sunlight piercing the grime-coated window, illuminating the chipped paint of the reception desk.  Elara, a wisp of a woman with perpetually tired eyes and a cascade of auburn curls escaping her bun, meticulously alphabetized the stack of architectural blueprints.  Each sheet, crisp and pristine, felt like a miniature universe of potential, a world held hostage in the grey concrete cage of the office.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and despair, a perfect backdrop for her quiet, yet meticulously organised, life.  Today, as always, the only real world Elara saw existed within the confines of the reception area, a world of appointments, phone calls, and the ever-present, faintly irritating clinking of keys from the office beyond.
