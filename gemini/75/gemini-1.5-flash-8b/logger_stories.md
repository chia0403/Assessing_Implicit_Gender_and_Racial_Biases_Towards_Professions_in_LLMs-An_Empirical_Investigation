The biting wind, a razor-sharp whisper against Elias Thornewood's weathered cheeks, clawed at the exposed skin of his hands.  Dust, the colour of dried blood, swirled in the meagre sunlight filtering through the skeletal branches of the ancient pines.  He squinted, his gaze sweeping across the vast, desolate expanse of the Blackwood Forest.  It wasn't the grandeur of the wilderness that caught his eye, but the ominous silence, a pregnant hush that felt thick and oppressive, hanging heavy in the air.  This was the heart of the Blackwood, a place where the trees stood as sentinels, their gnarled branches reaching out like skeletal fingers towards an unseen sky.  Even the usual chorus of birdsong was absent, replaced by a chilling, almost unnatural quiet.  Elias, a seasoned logger with eyes the colour of storm clouds and hands that could carve mountains, felt a prickle of unease crawl up his spine.  He needed wood.  He needed to provide.  But something about this place, this day, felt profoundly wrong.
