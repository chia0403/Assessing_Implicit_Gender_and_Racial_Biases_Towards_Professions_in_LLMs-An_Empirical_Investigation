The fluorescent hum of the dentist's office was a constant companion, a low, insistent thrum that echoed Amelia Nightingale's anxieties.  Today, the thrum felt particularly loud, a vibrating counterpoint to the knot tightening in her stomach.  It wasn't just the usual pre-appointment jitters. This was different.  This was about Mrs. Henderson, a woman Amelia had treated for years, a woman whose steady, kind eyes held a secret Amelia suspected she couldn't quite decipher.

Amelia, a dental hygienist with a patient smile that often masked her own inner turmoil, adjusted the gloves, the sterile white a stark contrast to the anxiety painting her cheeks.  Her small, cluttered office, nestled within the sprawling, aging brick building of Dr. Albright's Dental Clinic, felt claustrophobic today.  Sunlight, usually a welcome visitor, struggled to pierce the grime clinging to the dusty windows.  A faint, musty smell, a combination of antiseptic and something indefinably old, hung heavy in the air, clinging to the worn, leatherette armchairs and the chipped porcelain sinks.  Each instrument tray, meticulously arranged, felt like a weapon in the silent battle brewing between Amelia and the unknown.
