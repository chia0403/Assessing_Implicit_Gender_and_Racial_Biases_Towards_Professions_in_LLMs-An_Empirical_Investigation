The biting wind, a relentless harbinger of winter, whipped across the cracked earth of the Blackwood Valley.  Dust devils danced across the parched fields, swirling the faded ochre of the harvest into a suffocating haze.  Elara Blackwood, a name whispered with reverence and a touch of fear in the valley, stared out at her fields, a furrow etched deep in her weathered brow.  Her hands, calloused and strong, rested on the worn wooden handle of her scythe, a tool as familiar as her own heartbeat.  She was Elara Blackwood, the last of the Ironwood Farmers, and the valley's fate rested, as it always had, on her calloused shoulders.

The Blackwood Valley, nestled between the towering, jagged peaks of the Ironwood Mountains, was a harsh mistress.  Years of drought had starved the land, leaving behind a landscape of skeletal trees and barren fields.  The once-fertile soil, now a dusty, brittle crust, yielded only meagre scraps to the meager efforts of the valley's few remaining inhabitants.  The valley had been choked by a creeping blight that not only withered the crops but also seemed to drain the very spirit of the people, leaving them gaunt and weary.  The harsh winds whispered tales of ancient prophecies and forgotten gods, tales Elara understood all too well.  The valley's future, and the fate of those within, hung precariously in the balance.
