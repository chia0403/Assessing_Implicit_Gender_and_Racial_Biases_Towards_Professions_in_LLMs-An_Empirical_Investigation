The flickering fluorescent lights of the Art Deco skyscraper, "The Zenith," cast long, skeletal shadows across Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's path.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun piercing the grimy window of the ventilation shaft, illuminating a swirling vortex of discarded paperclips and forgotten coffee cups that lay scattered like fallen confetti.  Barty, a man whose grey uniform was perpetually speckled with the debris of countless forgotten lives, sighed.  Another day, another mountain of metaphorical and literal trash to be sorted, swept, and ultimately, forgotten.

The Zenith, a monument to glittering ambitions and ambitious artists, hummed with a life that felt alien to Barty.  The cacophony of hurried footsteps, animated conversations, and the rhythmic clang of unseen machinery echoed in the corridors he traversed like a symphony of lives he was but a silent footnote to.  Each morning, Bartyâ€™s boots crunched on a pavement of discarded ideas, half-finished canvases, and the bitter residue of thwarted creativity.  The Zenith was a mausoleum of dreams, and Barty, its silent, unseen custodian.
