Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the dilapidated clinic, a relentless drumming that mirrored the relentless pressure building inside Dr. Eleanor Vance.  The air hung thick with the smell of antiseptic and something subtly metallic, a faint, lingering trace that clung to the sterile walls like a ghost.  Eleanor Vance, a forensic psychologist with eyes the color of storm clouds and a mind honed by years of dissecting fractured memories, stared out at the skeletal branches of the ancient oak tree clawing at the grey sky.  This wasn't a hospital; it wasn't a modern facility.  This was the crumbling, forgotten outpost of Blackwood Manor, a place whispered about in hushed tones in the town of Ashworth, a town clinging to the foothills of the Appalachian mountains where secrets festered like the damp earth beneath their feet.

The setting: Blackwood Manor Clinic, a neglected Victorian structure nestled deep within a sprawling, overgrown estate.  Ivy choked the walls, obscuring the windows. The grounds, once manicured, were now choked with weeds and the skeletal remains of elaborate flowerbeds.  A sense of decay permeated the air, mirroring the psychological wounds that Dr. Vance suspected lay hidden within the walls.  A chill, deeper than the rain-soaked air, seemed to cling to the very stones, a palpable weight pressing down on the already burdened psychologist.
