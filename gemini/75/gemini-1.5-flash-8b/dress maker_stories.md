The scent of lavender and beeswax hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint, sweet aroma of freshly baked bread drifting up from the bakery below.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom of Amelia  Seraphina Nightingale’s tiny workshop.  Rows of meticulously pinned fabrics – silks the colour of twilight, cottons the hue of morning dew, velvets the deep indigo of a summer night – lined the walls, their textures whispering secrets only she could understand.  Amelia, a dressmaker of unmatched skill and quiet determination, hunched over a delicate, ivory silk gown, her needle a blur against the pale fabric.  The year was 1888. London, a city humming with industrial progress and Victorian grandeur, sprawled outside her small, cobbled workshop on the quieter side of Fleet Street.  The city’s pulse, however, rarely reached the quiet sanctuary of her cramped, but meticulously organised, space.  It was a world away from the bustling streets and high society balls, a world where whispers of secrets, and stories yet to be woven, were all that mattered.
