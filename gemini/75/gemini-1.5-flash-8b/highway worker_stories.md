The relentless Arizona sun beat down on Elias Thorne, a highway maintenance worker, baking the asphalt into a shimmering, almost oily surface.  Dust devils, whipped up by the unseen wind currents, danced across the vast, empty expanse of the desert highway, swirling around the rusted pickup truck Elias piloted.  He squinted, his weathered face a mask against the glare, and wiped sweat from his brow with a calloused hand.  The air, thick with the scent of sagebrush and something metallic, clung to him like a second skin.  This stretch of Route 66, somewhere between Kingman and Needles, felt more like a forgotten relic than a vital artery of the state.  Broken, cracked, and utterly unremarkable except for the unnerving silence that enveloped it.  Every rustle of the wind, every flicker of heat shimmer, seemed to amplify the profound loneliness. Today, that silence felt wrong.  A strange, unnatural quiet.  He checked the gauge.  Still plenty of gas, thank the Gods.
