The fluorescent lights of the "Super Saver Mart" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Butterfield's weary Tuesday.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the grime-coated window, illuminating the faded posters advertising week-long specials on canned peaches and frozen waffles.  The air, thick with the scent of stale coffee and the ever-present aroma of disinfectant, hung heavy, mirroring Amelia's mood.  Today, the line snaked around the cramped checkout counter like a stubborn, hungry serpent, each individual a miniature obstacle course in patience testing Amelia's dwindling reserve of cheerful pleasantries.  It was 2:17 PM, and the afternoon was already dragging itself into a swamp of slow, relentless boredom.  Amelia wiped down the sticky barcode scanner, its reflective surface mirroring the weary lines etched into her face.  Time, as always, seemed to stretch before her in a maddeningly slow expanse.
