The biting wind whipped Amelia "Em" Cartwright's tweed jacket around her as she surveyed the skeletal branches of the ancient oak.  Dust motes danced in the pale October sunlight, illuminating the stark, barren landscape of the Blackwood Estate.  Em, her brow furrowed in concentration, adjusted her spectacles.

Its upkeep was a demanding, if breathtaking, task.  Now, with autumn's final gasp of colour fading to grey, the challenge felt particularly acute.  The estate needed more than just pruning and weeding; it needed a whisper of life, a vibrant pulse that reflected the burgeoning sense of melancholy hanging in the air.  This particular job, the redesign of the overgrown, neglected rose garden, was proving to be more of a battle than a botanical project.  The gnarled, overgrown roses seemed to echo the turmoil within the walls of the estate itself.
