The biting wind whipped across the exposed stone face of Mount Aethelred, stinging Elara Stonehand's cheeks and stinging her eyes with gritty dust.  Sunlight, fractured and weak, struggled to pierce the swirling clouds, casting long, skeletal shadows across the meticulously carved glyphs etched into the mountainside.  Elara, her name a testament to her profession,  slung a worn leather apron over her shoulders, the rough leather a familiar comfort against her skin.  Her calloused hands, stained a deep ochre from the constant contact with the basalt, moved with a practiced grace, her chisel a faithful extension of her will.  She was alone, as always, in this forsaken corner of the kingdom, her small workshop nestled amidst the jagged peaks, a testament to her stubborn independence and fierce dedication to her craft.  This particular face of the mountain, designated the 'Heart of the Serpent,' was proving more challenging than any she'd tackled before. The patterns, deep and intricate, spoke of a forgotten language, a forgotten era. The King’s decree was clear: reclaim the ancient stonework for the coronation ceremony.  But the markings… they whispered stories Elara couldn’t quite comprehend.
