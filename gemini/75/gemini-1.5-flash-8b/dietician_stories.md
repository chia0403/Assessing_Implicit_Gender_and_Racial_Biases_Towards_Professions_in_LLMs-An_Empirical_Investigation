The aroma of roasted beetroot and cumin hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the sterile white of Dr. Anya Petrova's consultation room.  Sunlight, fractured by the tall, imposing windows of the sprawling, modernist clinic, illuminated dust motes dancing in the air.  Anya, Dr. Anya Petrova, meticulously measured a dollop of coconut yogurt into a small glass bowl, her brow furrowed in concentration.  Outside, the vibrant green leaves of the city's central park rustled in the late afternoon breeze, a symphony of life starkly in contrast to the quiet, clinical hum of the clinic.

The consultation room, a testament to minimalist design, featured a single, polished wooden table and two comfortable chairs. A sleek, modern display screen, mounted on the wall, showed a complex graph detailing a patient's metabolic profile.  Anya had been a registered dietician for 10 years, working tirelessly to help people understand the intricacies of nutrition, and today's patient was a particularly puzzling case.  The quiet clinking of her utensils, as she prepared a sample meal, was the only sound that disturbed the otherwise oppressive silence of the afternoon.
