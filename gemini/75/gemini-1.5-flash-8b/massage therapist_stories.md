Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the "Zenith Spa," a small, ramshackle building nestled deep within the whispering eucalyptus grove bordering the sprawling, neglected Blackwood Estate.  The scent of damp earth and decaying leaves hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the calming lavender and sandalwood oils that usually perfumed the space.  Inside, Amelia "Anya" Blackwood, a massage therapist with hands as gentle as the moonbeams filtering through the trees, sat hunched over her worn massage table.  A single, flickering bulb cast long shadows across her face, highlighting the weariness etched into her brow.  The rhythmic drumming of the rain was a constant companion, a soundtrack to her quiet contemplation.  The Blackwood Estate, once a beacon of opulence, now felt like a mausoleum of faded glory, its sprawling grounds mirroring the melancholic mood that clung to Anya like a shroud.
