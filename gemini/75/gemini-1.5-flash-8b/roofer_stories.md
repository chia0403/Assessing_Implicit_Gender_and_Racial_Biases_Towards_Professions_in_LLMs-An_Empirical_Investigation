The rain hammered against the corrugated iron, a relentless percussion that drowned out the anxieties gnawing at Bartholomew "Barty"  Featherstone's mind.  He hunched lower, the weight of the rusted scaffold pole digging into his shoulder.  Above him, the pewter sky reflected the grimness of the cityscape spread out below.  Towering skyscrapers, like skeletal fingers clawing at the clouds, pressed in on the ancient, three-story brick tenement where Barty worked. The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and the acrid tang of old paint, clung to him like a second skin.  He was perched precariously on a narrow ledge,  eight stories above the churning traffic of bustling Northcliffe Street, his hands gripping the loose boards with a desperation that mirrored the precariousness of his situation.

**Setting:**

The year is 1938.  Northcliffe Street, a grimy thoroughfare in the burgeoning industrial heart of a fictional city named "Atherton," is choked with the smoky exhaust of steam engines and the ceaseless clatter of horse-drawn carts.  The city, though prosperous in some areas, conceals pockets of poverty and despair, where the tenement buildings, like the one Barty was working on, whisper stories of hardship and resilience.  Atherton is a city built on ambition and sacrifice, its skyline a testament to both the industry and the inequality of its times.  The tenement, a crumbling monument to a bygone era, stands as a microcosm of the city's contradictions.
