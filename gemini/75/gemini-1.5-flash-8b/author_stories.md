The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Hawthorne's hands, a meager comfort against the biting January wind that whipped across the cobbled streets of Prague.  Sunlight, fractured and fleeting, illuminated the intricate carvings of the ancient buildings, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to mock the chill in the air.  Amelia, a writer known for her evocative descriptions of forgotten histories, felt a peculiar sense of unease, a cold knot tightening in her stomach.  Her latest manuscript, a collection of interconnected short stories set in the city's mystical underbelly, lay discarded on the worn wooden table of the Café Louvre, untouched for hours.  Outside, the Vltava River, usually a serene silver ribbon, snaked its way between the towering buildings, a relentless current mirroring the tempest brewing within her.  The café's aroma, usually a comforting blend of roasted coffee and spiced pastries, was barely perceptible through the biting wind.  This was not the city that whispered secrets to her pen.  This Prague felt…wrong.
