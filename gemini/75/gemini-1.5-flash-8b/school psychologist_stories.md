This was her third year as the school psychologist at  Evergreen High, and the oppressive weight of the unspoken, the unacknowledged, felt heavier than ever.  The familiar scent of stale coffee and antiseptic clung to the air, a stark contrast to the volatile emotions simmering beneath the veneer of teenage normalcy.  Amelia, with her perpetually rumpled cardigan and well-worn leather satchel, moved through the labyrinthine corridors like a shadow, trying to discern the subtle shifts in student behaviour, the hidden cracks in the facade of a seemingly well-ordered institution.  Today, the tremors felt particularly pronounced. A girl in a faded floral dress clutched a crumpled note, her eyes darting around the crowded halls as if searching for a way out of herself. A group of boys huddled in the corner, their hushed voices carrying whispers of trouble.  And somewhere deeper within the school’s complex systems, the quietest whispers, the most hidden fears, were calling to her.
