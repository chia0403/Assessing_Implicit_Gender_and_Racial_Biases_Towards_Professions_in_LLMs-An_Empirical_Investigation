Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, a relentless percussion that mirrored the rhythmic thump-thump of Amelia Hayesâ€™s heart.  The scent of damp earth and pine needles hung heavy in the air, mingling with the antiseptic tang of the physiotherapy room.  Amelia, a physical therapist with a sharp, observant gaze, meticulously adjusted the splints on a young woman's fractured wrist.  The girl, Lily, barely older than Amelia herself, lay still, her face pale and etched with a quiet resignation that tugged at the therapist's empathy.  The clinic, nestled deep within the whispering woods of Blackwood Forest, was a stark contrast to the bustling city life Amelia had left behind.  It was a haven, or perhaps a prison, depending on your perspective.  The isolated location offered solace, but the isolation felt like a suffocating blanket during the endless grey days.
