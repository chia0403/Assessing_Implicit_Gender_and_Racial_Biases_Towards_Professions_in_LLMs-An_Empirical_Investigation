The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine and something faintly metallic, like old pennies.  Amelia “Amy”  Everett, a flight attendant for Celestial Airways, felt the familiar knot tighten in her stomach.  This wasn't her usual pre-flight jitters; this was a different kind of anxiety, a premonition that clung to her like the scent of stale coffee in the air.  Her assigned flight, Celestial Airways 784, was scheduled for a routine hop across the Caribbean Sea, from the bustling port of Kingston, Jamaica, to the sun-drenched shores of Nassau, Bahamas.  But today, the destination felt ominous, like a storm gathering just beyond the horizon.

The cockpit was a stark contrast to the humid, fragrant chaos of the terminal.  Metal gleamed, instruments blinked with controlled precision, and the rhythmic hum of the engines promised a smooth flight.  Yet, Amy couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss.  The other flight attendants, usually buzzing with pre-flight chatter, were unusually quiet, their eyes flitting nervously around the cabin.

The plane itself, a gleaming Boeing 737-800, was an elegant, aerodynamic beast, a metal bird ready to take to the sky.  But tonight, even the smooth curves of the aircraft seemed to carry a dark undercurrent, mirroring the unease in Amy's own heart. Outside, the bustling chaos of Kingston International Airport began to fade, giving way to the inky blackness of the approaching night.  The island lights disappeared one by one, swallowed by the vast expanse of the ocean.
