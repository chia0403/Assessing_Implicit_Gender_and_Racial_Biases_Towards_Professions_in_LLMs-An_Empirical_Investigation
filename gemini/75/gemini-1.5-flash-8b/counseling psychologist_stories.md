Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the small, cluttered clinic, a rhythmic counterpoint to the frantic tapping of Dr. Eleanor Vance's fingers on her worn mahogany desk.  The scent of mildew, a familiar companion in the forgotten corners of the building, mingled with the faint, sickly sweet aroma of cheap coffee.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom of the waiting room, illuminating a chipped porcelain doll and a half-eaten bag of stale pretzels.  Eleanor, a counseling psychologist with a tired but determined expression, stared at the thick stack of referral forms before her.  Today promised to be another deluge of anxieties, fears, and fractured lives.  The chipped paint on the walls seemed to mirror the fractured pieces of the souls seeking her help.  Outside, the storm raged, a tempest mirroring the emotional turmoil brewing inside the walls of the clinic.  This was her sanctuary, her battlefield, and for now, she was the only one who could hold the storm at bay.
