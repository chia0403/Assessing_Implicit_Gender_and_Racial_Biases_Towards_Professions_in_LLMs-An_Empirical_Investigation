The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual, faded rose, reflected Amelia Nightingale's tired face.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grime-coated windowpanes of "Scissors & Smiles," her tiny salon nestled in the heart of the cobbled alleyway.  The scent of lavender and something faintly metallic, probably old hairspray, hung heavy in the air, mingling with the constant, low hum of the city outside.  Amelia, her name a whisper of delicate beauty amidst the clamor, had been battling a particularly stubborn knot in her own thick braid for the better part of an hour.  Her meticulously manicured nails, usually a testament to her careful precision, were now stained with a stubborn streak of henna, a testament to a client's insistent request.  The rhythmic *plink* of the old grandfather clock in the corner downstairs seemed to mock her frustration.  Outside, the cries of street vendors and the rumble of passing carts were a constant symphony of urban life, a world she both loved and loathed, a world she felt utterly trapped within.
