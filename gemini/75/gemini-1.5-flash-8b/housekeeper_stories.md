The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual, sickly yellow by years of scrubbing greasy pots and pans, reflected Amelia Thistlewick's weary face.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grime-coated window of the sprawling, Victorian manor, echoing the frantic rhythm of her own thoughts.  The air, thick with the scent of lavender and something vaguely metallic, hung heavy in the cavernous hallway beyond.  This was her third day at Blackwood Manor, and already, the house felt like a suffocating shroud, pressing down on her with the weight of unspoken secrets and unseen presences.

Amelia, a woman of forty-two with eyes the color of faded amethyst and a quiet strength etched into her every gesture, meticulously scrubbed a stubborn stain from the chipped ceramic bowl.  The manor, a gothic masterpiece of creaking timbers and looming shadows, stood sentinel on a windswept hill overlooking the misty valley below.  Cobwebs hung like macabre tapestries in the shadowy corners, and a constant, low hum, almost imperceptible, seemed to vibrate through the very foundations of the house. Every room held a story, a history whispered on the breeze, and Amelia felt like a moth drawn to a flame, compelled to unravel the mysteries that simmered beneath Blackwood Manor's stately fa√ßade.
