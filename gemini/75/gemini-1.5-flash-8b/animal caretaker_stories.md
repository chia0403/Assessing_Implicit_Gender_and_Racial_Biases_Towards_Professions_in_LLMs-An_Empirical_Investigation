The biting wind whipped Amelia Thistlewick's dark hair across her face as she surveyed the sprawling aviary.  Sunlight, fractured by the crisscrossing branches of the ancient oak trees that bordered the Whispering Woods Sanctuary, dappled the emerald-green enclosure.  A chorus of chirps, squawks, and the melodic trill of unseen birds filled the air, a symphony only an experienced ear could truly decipher. Amelia,  Animal Caretaker at Whispering Woods, adjusted her worn leather gloves, the cold seeping into her bones.  It was mid-November, and even the hardiest of the sanctuary's feathered residents were seeking shelter from the approaching winter.  Her job, and her life, revolved around this sanctuary, a haven for creatures deemed 'undesirable' or 'unwanted' by the wider world.


The aviary, a sprawling, intricately woven structure of willow and timber, was a haven of its own.  Inside, vibrant macaws, sleek grebes, and shy owls nestled amongst the leafy canopies.  The rich aroma of pine and damp earth clung to the air, a comforting contrast to the crisp chill.   Amelia, with her weathered face framed by wind-whipped hair, felt a deep connection to the creatures she cared for.  Each individual bird, each tiny rodent, each watchful lizard held a story, a tiny glimpse into the vastness of the natural world.  Her boots crunched on the gravel path, leading her towards the aviary's heart, a small hut built into the structure, where the temperature was more manageable, and the scents were less pervasive.  Tonight, the feeding schedule was more demanding than usual, with the arrival of a new, nocturnal owl species; the enigmatic  'Whispering Moon' owl.  And that was just one of the many challenges awaiting her.
