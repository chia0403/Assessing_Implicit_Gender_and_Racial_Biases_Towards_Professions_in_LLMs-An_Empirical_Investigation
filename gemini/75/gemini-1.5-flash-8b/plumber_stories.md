The flickering neon sign of "Bubbly Bob's Plumbing" cast a sickly yellow glow over the rain-slicked cobblestones of Alderbrook Alley.  Water, a constant companion in this perpetually damp backstreet, dripped from eaves and seeped from the cracked foundations of the ancient brick buildings.  Rain hammered relentlessly against the corrugated iron roof of the workshop, a rhythmic counterpoint to the insistent gurgle of a clogged drainpipe, amplified by the confined space.  Inside, Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, a plumber with hands weathered to the hue of faded copper and eyes that seemed to hold the secrets of every leaky faucet in Alderbrook, wrestled with a particularly stubborn sink.  Barty,  a man whose uniform of grease-stained overalls and a perpetually crooked cap spoke volumes about his profession, sighed, a sound that echoed the frustration building within him.  It was a Tuesday, and already, the alley was a symphony of dripping, gurgling, and the occasional desperate, muffled shout for help.
