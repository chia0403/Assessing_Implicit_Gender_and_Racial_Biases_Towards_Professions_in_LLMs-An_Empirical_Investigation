The scent of lilies, jasmine, and something vaguely metallic hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume that clung to the chipped paint of Amelia Nightingale’s flower shop, “Blooming Blooms.”  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless rhythm that echoed the frantic thumping in Amelia’s chest.  She squinted through the grime-streaked window, the muted light reflecting off the water-slicked pavement.  October in the coastal town of Alderhaven was usually a time of muted greys and resigned quiet, but today, something felt… off.  Not in the usual wilting, autumnal way, but in a palpable, almost tangible way that made her stomach churn.

Blooming Blooms was tucked away on a quiet side street, a small, unassuming shop with a front display overflowing with vibrant blooms that seemed to somehow defy the bleakness outside.  Amelia, a woman whose hands moved with an almost ethereal grace amongst the flowers, stood hunched over a basket of dusty roses, their petals drooping like mournful widows.  The shop's interior, though crammed with the usual floral bounty, felt claustrophobic.  Sunlight struggled to penetrate the thick lace curtains, casting long, distorted shadows that danced with the rain-streaked dust motes.  A low hum from the old, groaning refrigerator in the back of the shop mingled with the pitter-patter of rain, a symphony of foreboding.  The scent of lilies, jasmine, and something unfamiliar clung to the air, a potent mixture that seemed to whisper secrets only Amelia could hear.
