The biting wind whipped Amelia "Em" Butterfield's threadbare jacket around her, tugging at the already-loosened straps of her backpack.  Dust devils danced across the cracked earth of the Arboretum's neglected rose garden, swirling the scent of dried leaves and something faintly metallic into the frigid air.  November's skeletal branches clawed at a sky the colour of bruised plums, mirroring the bruise blossoming on Em's temple.  She’d been pruning the overgrown wisteria, her calloused hands aching with a weariness that went deeper than the physical strain.  The Arboretum, once a haven of vibrant blooms and carefully manicured paths, now felt like a forgotten relic, its beauty buried beneath a layer of neglect and rumour.  The whispering pines seemed to hold secrets within their gnarled branches, secrets Em suspected were darker than the spreading blight that had choked the once-prized azaleas.  

The Arboretum, nestled within the foothills of the Whispering Mountains, had been a proud, if somewhat isolated, institution for a century.   Now, shrouded in a perpetual twilight of mist and fading glory, it held an atmosphere as heavy as the leaden sky above.  Cobwebs draped over ancient stone benches, and the scent of decaying roses clung to the air, a stark contrast to the sharp, bracing scent of pine.  Rusty hinges groaned on the massive wrought-iron gates, which were themselves scarred and tarnished by decades of neglect.   The only sounds besides the wind's mournful song were the rhythmic crunching of Em's boots on fallen branches and the occasional, hollow thud as a rusted birdhouse fell from a blighted oak.  This was Em’s kingdom, a kingdom of sorrow and faded beauty, a kingdom she was determined to reclaim, one pruned branch and one carefully watered seedling at a time.
