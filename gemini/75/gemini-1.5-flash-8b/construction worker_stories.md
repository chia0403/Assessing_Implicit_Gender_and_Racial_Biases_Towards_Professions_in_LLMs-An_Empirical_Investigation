The biting wind whipped across the exposed steel scaffolding, stinging Elias Thorne's cheeks.  He hunched deeper into his oversized, rain-soaked parka, the rhythmic clang of metal against metal a familiar, almost comforting sound in the pre-dawn gloom.  Below, the city of Veridian sprawled out in a tapestry of muted grey and bruised purple, the towering skyscrapers seemingly frozen in a perpetual twilight.  Elias was on the 17th floor of the "Horizon Spire," a newly commissioned residential complex, working with the final concrete pouring crew.  His hands, roughened and calloused from years of hammering and lifting, gripped the safety harness, the metal cold against his skin. The air, though frigid, vibrated with the underlying thrum of city life awakening, a symphony of distant sirens and the first tentative honks of car horns.  This was his routine: the pre-dawn chill, the endless climb, and the demanding work that forged him into the man he was.  Today, the Horizon Spire would be his personal canvas, and the concrete, his paint.
