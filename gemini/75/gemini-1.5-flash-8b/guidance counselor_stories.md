The flickering fluorescent lights of the Northwood High School guidance office hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Katherine Finch’s quiet workday.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grimy windowpane, illuminating a jumble of papers, folders, and half-eaten granola bars on her cluttered desk.  Amelia, a guidance counselor with a perpetually tired smile and eyes that held the weight of countless teenage anxieties, sighed. Another Tuesday. Another wave of students seeking direction, hoping for a glimmer of clarity in the overwhelming fog of their futures.

Northwood High was a sprawling, brick behemoth, its imposing façade masking the struggles and aspirations of the students who walked its hallowed halls.  The school, nestled within the shadow of the towering industrial park that dominated the western side of the city, seemed to absorb the grey gloom of the perpetually overcast sky, a tangible sense of quiet desperation clinging to the air. The worn, creaky wooden stairs connecting the different levels echoed with the rhythmic thud of footsteps and the muted whispers of students navigating the labyrinthine corridors.  The smell of stale coffee and old textbooks hung heavy in the air, a familiar aroma that had become a kind of comfort, an olfactory marker of the relentless cycle of school life. Outside, the relentless whine of passing trucks and the distant rumble of machinery blended with the rhythmic squeak of sneakers echoing down the hallways, a constant hum beneath the surface of the day.
