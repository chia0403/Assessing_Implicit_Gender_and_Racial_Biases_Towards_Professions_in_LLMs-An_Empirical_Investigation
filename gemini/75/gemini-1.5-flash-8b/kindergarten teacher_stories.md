The chipped paint on the walls of Ms. Eleanor Ainsworth's kindergarten classroom seemed to absorb the afternoon sun, turning the once vibrant yellows and blues into muted, dusty hues.  Tiny, colourful drawings, haphazardly plastered to the bulletin board, depicted everything from fantastical beasts to perfectly rendered bananas.  A faint scent of crayons and spilled milk hung in the air, a familiar, comforting aroma that was, in some ways, more potent than the expensive air freshener Mrs. Peterson insisted on using.  Today, though, it felt heavier, thicker, laden with an unspoken tension.  The usually boisterous chatter of the five-year-olds was subdued, their usual joyful energy replaced by a nervous quietude.  It was the day before the annual "Super Springtime Storytime Celebration."
