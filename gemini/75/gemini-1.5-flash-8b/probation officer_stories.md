Rain hammered against the grimy windows of the probation office, a relentless percussion mirroring the rhythmic thumping of Amelia "Amy"  Fitzwilliam's heart.  The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sterile, almost accusing glow on the stacks of case files that overflowed from the metal cabinets.  Amy, a probation officer with five years under her belt, stared at the latest report on her newest charge,  a young man named Leo, a name that somehow seemed to embody the very essence of her frustration.

Rain-slicked streets reflected the pale, overcast sky in an almost mirror image, a reflection of the clouded and uncertain future that Amy felt looming over her every interaction.  The muted grey of the surroundings seemed to bleed into the pervasive smell of stale coffee and cheap, synthetic air freshener that clung to the air.  Outside, the city's relentless hum of urban life seemed to exist in another dimension, while within these walls, the suffocating weight of individual failures pressed down.
