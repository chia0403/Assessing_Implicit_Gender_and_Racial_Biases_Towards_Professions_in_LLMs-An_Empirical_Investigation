The chipped paint on the shed door, a faded ochre that whispered tales of countless sunrises and sunsets, offered little resistance to Silas Blackwood’s determined hands.  He, Silas Blackwood, carpenter extraordinaire (though he preferred the less grandiose “repairman”), pressed his palms against the warped wood, a silent battle against the encroaching rot.  The scent of damp earth mingled with the acrid tang of linseed oil, a familiar symphony accompanying the rhythmic *tap* *tap* *tap* of his chisel.  He was in his workshop, a small, cluttered space nestled behind his house on the edge of the whispering woods of Oakhaven, a place that held secrets as deep and ancient as the gnarled oaks that bordered his property.  Cobwebs, thick as spun moonlight, draped from the rafters, and the dust motes danced in the lone shaft of sunlight that pierced the gloom.  Tools, sharp and gleaming, lay scattered like fallen stars on a workbench stained with the rich history of countless projects.  Silas's weathered hands, strong and calloused, were his most trusted companions, his silent partners in the creation of the beautiful and the useful.
