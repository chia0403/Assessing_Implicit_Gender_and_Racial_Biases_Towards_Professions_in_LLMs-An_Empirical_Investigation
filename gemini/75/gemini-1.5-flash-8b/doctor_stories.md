The air hung thick with the smell of antiseptic and something indefinably metallic, a scent that clung to the damp walls like a shroud.  Outside, the jungle, usually a vibrant tapestry of emerald and gold, was now a swirling, inky blackness.

Patients, their faces etched with worry and exhaustion, huddled around the meager fire in the waiting room, their anxieties amplified by the storm's fury.

Aris, his brow furrowed, listened intently to the labored breaths of a young woman, her fever-bright eyes staring blankly.  Tonight, the quiet desperation of Avani threatened to overwhelm him, and the storm outside seemed to share his mounting unease.
