The fluorescent lights of Dr. Amelia Hayes's office hummed a monotonous tune, a stark contrast to the rhythmic crackle of the old, oak floorboards beneath her feet.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun slicing through the grimy windowpanes of the small, second-floor clinic tucked away on a quiet, cobbled street in the heart of the decaying Victorian district.  Amelia, a chiropractor with eyes the colour of warm honey, felt a familiar twinge in her own neck.  It was the kind of ache that came with a day spent coaxing life back into stiff spines, a day spent listening to the whispers of pain and the frustrated sighs of her patients.  Today, however, the whispers were different.  They weren't just the usual complaints of backaches and headaches.  Today, they carried an undercurrent ofâ€¦ unease.
