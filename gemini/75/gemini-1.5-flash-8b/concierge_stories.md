The flickering neon sign of the Grand Zenith Hotel cast a sickly green glow on the rain-slicked cobblestones of Rue des Ã‰toiles.  A single, defiant dandelion stubbornly poked through a crack in the pavement, its yellow head defiant against the encroaching grey.  Inside,  Monsieur Antoine Dubois, Grand Zenith's meticulously-trained concierge, adjusted his impeccably pressed waistcoat.  The Parisian air, usually a symphony of hurried footsteps and cafe chatter, was muted this evening, swallowed by the insistent drumming of rain.  Antoine, a man whose calm was almost a physical presence, surveyed the lobby.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom of the vast, mahogany-lined space.  Tonight, the hotel held a peculiar stillness, an unnerving calm before a storm that felt less like weather and more like the unspoken anxieties of his clientele.  His polished shoes seemed to absorb the silence.
