The biting wind whipped across the cobbled plaza, stinging Sergeant Alistair Finch’s cheeks.  Dust devils, stirred by the unseen currents of the city's heart, danced across the worn stone, obscuring the towering spires of the Citadel of Aethelgard in a hazy veil.  A chill, deeper than the air, settled in Alistair's bones.  Not just the chill of the early dawn, but the gnawing anxiety that clung to him like the frost clinging to the gargoyles that watched over the plaza from every crenelated rooftop.  He tightened his grip on the worn leather strap of his halberd, the cold metal a comforting weight against his palm.  The city, normally a vibrant tapestry of life, was eerily quiet.  Even the usual cacophony of vendors hawking their wares, the whispers of gossips, the children's laughter—all were absent.  This unsettling stillness, this palpable unease, was the city's way of announcing trouble.


The Citadel of Aethelgard, a monument to forgotten empires and arcane knowledge, rose majestically above the sleeping city.  Its many levels, spiralling up into the mist-shrouded sky, were a labyrinth of narrow passageways and shadowy courtyards.  The walls themselves seemed to breathe, whispering stories of long-past wars and forgotten gods.  Alistair, stationed at the base of the western ramparts, felt the weight of centuries upon him.  Every stone, every gargoyle, seemed to watch, judging his every movement.  The city, and its secrets, held him in its ancient grip.
