The chipped Formica countertop, stained a sickly yellow-brown where spilled espresso had long ago succumbed to the relentless onslaught of countless mornings, felt strangely cool under Amelia "Amy"  Fontana's fingertips.  The air in "The Rusty Mug," a diner clinging to the fringes of downtown, hung thick with the scent of stale coffee, simmering bacon, and the faint, lingering perfume of a woman who had probably just left.  It was a Tuesday, the slowest day of the week, and the fluorescent lights buzzed with a monotonous hum, mimicking the rhythm of Amy's own thoughts.

Sunlight, fractured and weak, slanted through the grimy window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the stale air.  Outside, the city stirred, a symphony of honking horns and rumbling engines, oblivious to the quiet drama unfolding within the diner's cramped confines. Amy, perpetually tired and slightly melancholic, sighed. Another Tuesday. Another stack of empty coffee cups to polish. Another round of overheard conversations that would fade into the day's haze as quickly as the morning mist.  The rhythmic clatter of silverware against plates was the only constant, a lullaby of sorts in this otherwise muted world.
