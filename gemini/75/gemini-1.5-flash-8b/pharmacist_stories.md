The fluorescent lights of the "Apothecary's Corner" hummed, a low, monotonous drone that seemed to vibrate through Amelia Blackwood's very bones.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the grime-coated window, illuminating a faded poster advertising a cure for the common cold (circa 1978, judging by the font).  Amelia, a pharmacist with eyes the colour of aged amber and a perpetually tired smile, meticulously labelled a batch of meticulously measured cough syrups.  The scent of antiseptic and decaying leaves hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume of her small-town pharmacy.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful dirge, a symphony of autumn leaves swirling and colliding against the weathered clapboard walls.  Today, however, the usual, comforting rhythm of the pharmacy was disrupted, not by the boisterous crowds of holiday shoppers or the insistent demands of a cough-ridden populace, but by a singular, silent tremor that had settled over the quiet town of Oakhaven, a tremor that resonated deep within the very fabric of the pharmacy itself.
