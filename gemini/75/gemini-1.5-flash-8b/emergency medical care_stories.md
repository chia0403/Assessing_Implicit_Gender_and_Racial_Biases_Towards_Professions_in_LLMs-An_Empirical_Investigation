The fluorescent lights of the emergency room hummed a monotonous, almost mocking, tune.  Rain hammered against the windowpanes, mirroring the frantic rhythm of Dr. Anya Sharma's heart.  Anya, a seasoned emergency medical care provider with five years under her belt, stared at the patient stretcher, her brow furrowed in concentration.  The young man, no older than twenty, lay still, his chest rising and falling with labored breaths, his eyes wide and unfocused.  Around them, the room buzzed with the cacophony of sirens wailing, beeping machines, and the hushed whispers of other medical professionals.


The setting:  The bustling, perpetually-overcrowded emergency department of a large, urban hospital on a blustery autumn night.  A palpable tension hung in the air, a mixture of adrenaline and apprehension.  The smell of antiseptic and fear mingled with the faint aroma of rain-soaked asphalt wafting in from the outside.  Outside the emergency room doors, the city throbbed with life, indifferent to the silent drama unfolding within the sterile walls.
