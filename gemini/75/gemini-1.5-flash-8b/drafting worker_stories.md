The fluorescent lights of the drafting room hummed, a monotonous drone that echoed the rhythmic scratch of pencils across the tracing paper.  Dust motes danced in the pale light, reflecting off the gleaming chrome of the drafting tables.  Elias Thorne, a drafting worker with calloused fingers and eyes that seemed to absorb the intricate lines and curves on the paper, meticulously inked a detail on the blueprints.  The air was thick with the smell of stale coffee and the faint, acrid scent of the photocopying machine, a familiar and comforting aroma for the regulars in the cramped, windowless room.


Setting:  The perpetually shadowed drafting room of a mid-sized architectural firm on the third floor of a nondescript downtown building in the early 1960s.  The city's roar of traffic, a distant yet persistent rumble, was a constant companion to the precise, quiet work within the room.  Outside, the early summer heat pressed down on the city; inside, the air conditioning, if it could be called that, just barely managed to keep the humidity at bay.
