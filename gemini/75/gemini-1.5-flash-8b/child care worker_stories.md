The fluorescent lights of the "Little Explorers" daycare hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia Hawthorne's routine.  Crayon shavings littered the table, a testament to the creative chaos of the 3-year-old art class.  Amelia, a young woman with perpetually tired eyes and a smile that tried valiantly to stay cheerful, knelt beside a tiny, red-haired girl named Lily.  Lily was meticulously arranging tiny, plastic dinosaurs in a row, each one meticulously placed facing a specific, imaginary direction.  Outside, the city of Veridian hummed with a different kind of energy, a relentless thrum of cars and sirens, a far cry from the contained, quiet hum of the daycare.  Veridian was a sprawling metropolis, its tall glass buildings reflecting the perpetual grey sky, often hiding a sun barely strong enough to warm the streets below.  Amelia knew this city well.  She knew the subtle shifts in the ambient temperature, the particular timbre of the announcements blasting from the city hall, and the constant, quiet hum of the urban landscape, even inside the walls of Little Explorers.
