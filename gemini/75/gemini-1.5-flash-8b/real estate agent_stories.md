The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Amie" Hernandez's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks as she hurried down the narrow, cobblestone street.  Leafy branches, skeletal against the bruised twilight sky, clawed at the worn brick facades of the old Victorian houses lining the street.  A faint scent of woodsmoke, mingled with the metallic tang of rain-soaked pavement, hung heavy in the air.  Amie, a real estate agent with the sharp, practical energy of a seasoned mountain climber, navigated the treacherous, almost forgotten alleyways of the historic district, her clipboard clutched tightly in her hand.  Tonight, she had a crucial showing.  The house, a grand, but sadly neglected, three-story Victorian known locally as "The Raven's Nest," was rumoured to have been haunted.  And Amie, despite her pragmatic nature, found herself acutely aware of the chilling whispers of the rumour, a counterpoint to the city's bustling, modern rhythm.  The house, with its darkened windows and the unsettling stillness that seemed to cling to it like a shroud, stood as a sentinel on the precipice of history and the unknown.
