The biting wind whipped Amelia "Ash" Hayes's crimson fire-retardant jacket around her, stinging her cheeks and making her teeth chatter.  Below, the inferno roared, a monstrous, guttural beast consuming the old Victorian mansion on Elm Street.  Flames licked at the eaves like hungry tongues, painting the night sky in an unholy orange.  Smoke, thick and acrid, choked the air, stinging her eyes and filling her lungs with a bitter, choking dust.  Ash, already covered in soot and sweat, gritted her teeth, focusing on the task at hand. This wasn't just another fire; it smelled… *different*.  There was something… metallic in the air, something unnatural.

The setting was Elm Street, a narrow, winding street lined with decaying Victorian houses.  The air, usually crisp and clean with the scent of autumn leaves, was now thick with the acrid stench of burning wood and something else, something metallic and unsettling.  The old Victorian mansion, the heart of the fire, stood at the end of the street, its once-proud façade now a skeletal framework of charred wood, twisted metal, and jagged glass.  The rhythmic clang of axes and the desperate shouts of fellow firefighters echoed around her, a cacophony against the deafening roar of the flames.  The flickering light of the fire trucks cast long, dancing shadows that seemed to writhe and twist in time with the fire itself, obscuring the eerie silence of the surrounding neighborhood, as if to hide something.
