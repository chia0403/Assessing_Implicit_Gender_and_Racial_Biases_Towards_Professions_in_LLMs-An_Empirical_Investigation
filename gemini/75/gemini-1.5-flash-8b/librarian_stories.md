Dust motes danced in the beams, tracing ethereal patterns across the towering shelves.

The air, thick with the scent of aged paper and disinfectant, held the echoes of countless whispered secrets and silent pleas for knowledge.  Outside, the city of Oakhaven, sprawling and gritty, thrummed with a life Elias rarely participated in.  He preferred the quiet sanctuary of the library, a sanctuary now threatened by whispers of a looming economic crisis.
