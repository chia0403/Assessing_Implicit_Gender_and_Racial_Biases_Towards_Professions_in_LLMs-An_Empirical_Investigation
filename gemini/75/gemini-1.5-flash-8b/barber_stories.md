The chipped porcelain sink in Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's barbershop, "The Snip & Snarl," was overflowing with lukewarm water.  Steam, thick and iridescent in the afternoon sun filtering through the dusty windowpanes, curled around the chipped paint on the walls, mimicking the swirling mists in the forgotten corners of Barty’s mind.  Cobwebs, thicker than a spider's silken sheets, draped from the dusty mirror, clinging to faded posters of vintage racing cars and blurry, almost-forgotten photographs of smiling clients.  The only sound, besides the rhythmic drip-drip-drip of the overflowing sink, was the quiet hum of the old-fashioned electric clippers, a persistent, almost mournful, counterpoint to the silence of the afternoon.  Barty, a man whose grey hair, despite the daily shearing, seemed to have sprung from a forgotten woodland, leaned over his current client, a weathered farmer named Silas, a man whose hands told stories as old as the faded photographs.  Outside, the rhythmic clang of the blacksmith’s hammer echoed across the cobbled street, a sound that usually filled Barty with a sense of peace. Today, however, it felt like a persistent, jarring reminder of the world outside the familiar walls of his barbershop.
