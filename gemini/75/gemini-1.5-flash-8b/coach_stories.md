The biting wind whipped across the frozen expanse of the Glacial Valley, stinging Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's cheeks.  Snow, the consistency of powdered glass, crunched under the cleats of the Nordic skiers as they pushed through the early morning chill.  Amy, a woman sculpted from granite and determination, stood at the head of the pack, her breath forming small, white clouds in the frigid air.  Her worn ski jacket, emblazoned with the crest of the "Glacier Gladiators" ski team, seemed to hum with the energy she projected. The valley, carved by millennia of glacial movement, was a breathtaking, unforgiving landscape.  Towering granite peaks, frosted with rime, scraped the bruised, grey sky.  Below, the valley floor, a vast expanse of snow-covered pines and the occasional stark, black rock outcrop, stretched out to the horizon. This was the crucible where champions were forged, and today, Amy Hawthorne was ready to instill her will into her athletes.
