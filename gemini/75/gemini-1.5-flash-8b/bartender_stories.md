The flickering neon sign of the Rusty Mug cast a sickly yellow glow across Amelia "Sparrow"  Featherstone's face.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of moonlight slicing through the grime-coated window, illuminating the chipped porcelain mugs lining the back bar.  The air hung thick with the mingled scents of stale beer, burnt coffee, and desperation.  It was a Tuesday night, the kind that seemed designed to suck the colour from the world, and the Rusty Mug was, as always, the perfect echo chamber.  Sparrow, her name a whispered secret amongst the regulars, poured another shot of whiskey, the ice clinking against the glass like distant thunder.  A new patron, a man cloaked in shadows and smelling faintly of rain and regret, took a seat at the bar.  His face was obscured by the shadows, but a single, piercing emerald green eye caught Sparrow's attention.  It was a gaze that held the weight of unspoken stories, a gaze that hinted at something far more than just a thirst for whiskey.  And Sparrow, seasoned veteran of the Rusty Mug, knew that tonight's story would be a long one.

**Setting:**

The Rusty Mug was a dive bar nestled in the shadowed alleys of the city's Lower Quarter.  Rain-streaked brick walls, peeling paint, and the persistent aroma of damp earth clung to the space like a second skin.  The clientele ranged from weary merchants to shadowy figures with stories best left untold.  The bar itself was a labyrinth of worn wood, cracked Formica, and half-empty bottles.  Its cramped confines were illuminated by flickering fluorescent lights and the occasional flickering gas lamp.  A constant hum of low conversation and the clinking of glasses filled the space, masking the quiet desperation that permeated the air.
