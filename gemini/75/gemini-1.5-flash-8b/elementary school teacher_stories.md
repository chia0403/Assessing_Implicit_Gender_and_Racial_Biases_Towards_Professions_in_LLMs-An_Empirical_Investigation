The chipped paint of Miss Amelia Blackwood's classroom, a faded, buttercream yellow, seemed to hum with a low, persistent thrum.  It wasn't the fluorescent lights, though they flickered erratically, casting long, dancing shadows across the rows of desks.  No, this wasn't a typical Tuesday morning at Maplewood Elementary.  A subtle, almost imperceptible shift in the atmosphere hung in the air, a premonition of something extraordinary, or perhaps, something terribly wrong.  The air itself smelled faintly of woodsmoke and something else, something sweet and unsettling, like overripe fruit trapped in a forgotten cellar.

Amelia Blackwood, a woman whose auburn hair was perpetually tangled with stray strands of yarn from the countless craft projects she oversaw, surveyed her class of fifth graders.  Sunlight, fractured by the grimy windowpanes, caught the glint of nervous anticipation in their eyes. They were, as always, a vibrant tapestry of individualities, but today, the threads seemedâ€¦strained.  The familiar murmur of conversation was replaced by an unnerving quiet.  A faint, almost inaudible, whisper echoed through the room, a sound like a swarm of tiny wings beating against the stillness.
