The rain hammered against the ornately-carved eaves of the Grand Chateau de Paris, a rhythmic tattoo that mirrored the frantic drumming in Elara Seraphina Dubois’s ears.  From her vantage point behind the mahogany desk, the city lights shimmered like a million fallen stars, blurring through the misty sheets of rain.  The Grand Chateau, a monument to opulent French history, stood sentinel against the storm, its grandeur both a comfort and a pressure. Elara, the concierge, felt the weight of the chateau—its history, its secrets, its expectations—pressing down on her shoulders.

The setting:  The Grand Chateau de Paris, a lavish hotel nestled in the heart of the Marais district, a historic neighborhood steeped in Parisian charm and whispers of forgotten stories.  The opulent lobby, normally a scene of hushed conversations and polished shoes, was unusually quiet, the only sound the relentless drumming of the rain against the stained-glass windows.  Antique chandeliers cast long, dancing shadows over the marble floors, highlighting dust motes that danced in the fading daylight.  A faint scent of aged leather and pipe tobacco clung to the air, a familiar perfume of the hotel’s long history.
