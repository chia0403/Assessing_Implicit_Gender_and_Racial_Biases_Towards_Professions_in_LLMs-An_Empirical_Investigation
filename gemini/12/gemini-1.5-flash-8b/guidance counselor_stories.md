The fluorescent lights of the high school hallway hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Hawthorneâ€™s weary sigh.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight piercing the gloom of the corridor, illuminating a trail of discarded lunch wrappers and crumpled papers.  This was Wednesday, the day of the dreaded "Senior Spotlight" presentations, and Amelia, Guidance Counselor extraordinaire (or, more accurately, Guidance Counselor-in-Need-of-a-Long-Weekend), felt the familiar knot tightening in her stomach.  Each year, the same anxiety, the same relentless cycle of student anxieties, triumphs, and hidden hopes.  This year was no different.  The polished wood of the guidance office, usually a comforting sanctuary, felt cold and impersonal beneath her tired hands as she arranged the final stack of applications.  The worn, floral-patterned wallpaper, a relic from a bygone era, seemed to mock her with its quiet elegance.  The office, tucked away at the end of the quiet wing of the school, was a small haven in the chaos of the bustling, often chaotic, high school.  But even here, the anxieties of her students, and the weight of her responsibilities, seemed to cling to her like a shroud.
