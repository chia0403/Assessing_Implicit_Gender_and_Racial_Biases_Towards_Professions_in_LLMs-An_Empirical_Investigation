The biting November wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's trench coat around her legs, tugging at the frayed edges of her scarf.  Rain, a relentless curtain, plastered the cobblestones of the narrow alleyway to a slick, unforgiving surface.  She squinted, the pale light of a streetlamp struggling to pierce the gloom, and adjusted the worn leather satchel slung across her shoulder.  This was her kind of hunting ground, this forgotten corner of the city, the place where whispers of forgotten fortunes and faded grandeur clung to the air like the remnants of a forgotten perfume.  Amelia, a real estate agent with a particular penchant for uncovering the hidden histories of her properties, was on the trail of a house, a Victorian masterpiece rumored to hold the key to a hidden treasure, a trove of forgotten stories.  Her target: 28 Elm Street, the location of the former Blackwood estate.  A name that sent a shiver down her spine, a name that whispered her own family history, a family tied to this very piece of property for generations.

Her office, a stark contrast to the alleyway, was a sun-drenched oasis tucked away on a quiet side street, decorated with muted pastels and overflowing with the tangible promise of dreams.  Stacks of meticulously organized folders, each one representing a potential client, a future homeowner, a new chapter.  But today, the scent of rain and the echo of the city's secrets held a different kind of allure, drawing Amelia away from the familiar comfort of her well-organized life and pushing her into the unknown.
