The pre-dawn chill bit at Amelia "Milly"  Harding's exposed cheeks as she climbed into the cab of the Caterpillar 990.  Dust devils, whipped up by the relentless desert wind, danced across the ochre expanse of the Nevada Test and Training Range.  The air, thick with the metallic tang of exhaust and the faint, acrid smell of ozone, hung heavy around her.  Outside, the sun was a promise, a fiery orange disc just beginning to paint the jagged peaks of the surrounding mountains.  Milly felt a familiar knot of anxiety tighten in her stomach.  Another day, another meticulously planned, yet always unpredictable, job.  This one was different, though.  This one involved a new piece of equipment, a prototype dubbed the "Titan," a colossal, experimental tracked vehicle designed to withstand extreme stress tests, and Milly, as the lead operator, was responsible for its initial deployment.  The silence of the empty landscape, broken only by the whisper of the wind and the rhythmic thump of the Titan's enormous tracks on the packed earth, felt unnervingly profound.  Today, silence held its breath, waiting.
