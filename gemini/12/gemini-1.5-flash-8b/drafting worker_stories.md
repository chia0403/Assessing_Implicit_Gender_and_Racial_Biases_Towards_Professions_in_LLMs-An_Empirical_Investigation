The fluorescent lights of the assembly hall hummed, a constant, almost oppressive drone that echoed the rhythmic clatter of metal against metal.  Amelia Petrova, a drafting worker at the Zenith Manufacturing facility, felt the familiar weight of the day settling on her shoulders.  Dust motes danced in the meagre shafts of light filtering through the grimy windows, illuminating the sprawling rows of drafting tables, each cluttered with blueprints, precision instruments, and the remnants of countless hours spent meticulously tracing and re-tracing designs.  The air, thick with the smell of oil and burnt solder, hung heavy in the stale atmosphere.  Outside, the city of Ashwood, shrouded in perpetual smog, remained a hazy backdrop, barely visible through the industrial haze.  Amelia, a young woman with eyes the colour of storm clouds and hands calloused from years of precise work, adjusted her glasses, her gaze fixated on the intricate diagram before her.  The task, a revised blueprint for the Zenith-400 hovercraft, felt more than just a job; it felt like a responsibility.  She traced the lines with a focused intensity, the familiar click-click-click of her mechanical pencil the only sound accompanying the hum of the factory.
