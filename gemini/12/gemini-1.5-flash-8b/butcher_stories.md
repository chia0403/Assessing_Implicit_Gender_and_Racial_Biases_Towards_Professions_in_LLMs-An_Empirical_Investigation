The air in the "Bloody Butcher" hung thick with the scent of rosemary, sweat, and aged blood.  Sunlight, fractured by the grime-coated windows, cast long, distorted shadows across the polished butcher block where Bartholomew "Barty" Grimshaw meticulously carved a plump, ruby-red sirloin.  The rhythmic *thunk* of his cleaver echoed against the worn wooden floor, a counterpoint to the low murmur of the bustling market square outside.  Barty, a man weathered by the years, his face a map of deep-set lines etched by countless hours spent wielding the cold steel, felt a familiar tremor of unease.  It wasn't the usual pre-market jitters; this was something else entirely.  Something… sinister.

The "Bloody Butcher" wasn't just a shop; it was a small, slightly ramshackle establishment nestled on the cobbled streets of Veridian, a town perched precariously on a cliff overlooking a shimmering emerald bay.  Houses clustered tightly, their painted facades a riot of blues, greens, and oranges, contrasting with the slate grey of the ancient ramparts that encircled the town.  A constant breeze carried the salt spray from the sea, tempering the heat of the midday sun.  The market square, with its overflowing stalls piled high with fresh produce, fish, and exotic spices, throbbed with the energy of a thousand competing voices.  But today, the usual cacophony felt somehow… muted.
