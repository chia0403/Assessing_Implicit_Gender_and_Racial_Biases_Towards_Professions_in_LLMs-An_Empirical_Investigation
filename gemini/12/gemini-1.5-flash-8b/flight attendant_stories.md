The flickering neon sign of the "Aurora Airways" logo cast a sickly yellow glow on Amelia Hernandez's uniform, highlighting the crisp white of her blouse and the faint smudges of coffee that stubbornly clung to her apron.  Below, the sprawling tarmac of the Cancun International Airport stretched out, a concrete jungle buzzing with activity.  The rhythmic rumble of departing jets and the cacophony of Spanish voices filled the air, a soundtrack to Amelia's nightly routine.  She wasn't sure what she was more tired ofâ€”the constant jet lag or the perpetual hum of anxiety that followed her. Tonight, it was both.  She was on flight 747, the penultimate leg of a grueling transatlantic route, and the destination was Chicago, a city that held a mixture of unfamiliar excitement and the familiar weight of unspoken promises.  Amelia, a flight attendant for Aurora Airways, found herself bracing for the inevitable turbulence, not just of the plane, but of the emotions she carried within.
