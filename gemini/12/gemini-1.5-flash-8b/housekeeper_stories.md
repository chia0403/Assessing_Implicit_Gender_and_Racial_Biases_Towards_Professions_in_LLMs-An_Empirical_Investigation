The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual milky grey, reflected the muted light filtering through the dusty, floral wallpaper.  A single, bare bulb flickered above Amelia Hawthorne, casting long, dancing shadows across the immaculate, if slightly worn, mahogany floorboards.  The air, thick with the faint scent of lavender and old books, hung heavy in the silent Victorian house, a symphony of quiet ticking and the rhythmic creak of the floorboards under her feet.  Amelia, a housekeeper for the past five years at Blackwood Manor, hummed a low tuneless melody to herself, her movements precise and deliberate as she scrubbed the grime from the chipped edge of a teacup.

Blackwood Manor stood on a rise overlooking the town of Ashworth, its imposing silhouette – a mix of gothic turrets and delicate Victorian gingerbread – a stark contrast to the brightly colored houses nestled below.  Ivy, thick and gnarled, clung to the crumbling stone walls, whispering tales of forgotten generations in the gentle breeze that sighed through the tall, narrow windows.  The manor felt ancient, steeped in history, both grand and forgotten, like a relic from a different era.  A palpable sense of melancholy hung in the air, a melancholic counterpoint to Amelia’s quiet hum.
