The pre-dawn chill, thick as pea soup, clung to the desolate expanse of Interstate 80.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of sun-baked asphalt and forgotten dreams, danced across the cracked pavement.  Amelia "Amy" Blackwood, a highway maintenance worker with calloused hands and eyes the colour of a stormy sky, adjusted her headlamp.  The beam sliced through the grey, illuminating a stretch of road stretching into an inky void.  This was her domain, this silent, unforgiving landscape of concrete and steel, the place where she found a semblance of peace and purpose amidst the relentless rhythm of the highway's roar.  Amy, a woman who measured her days in miles and her success in successfully patching a pothole, was alone, as she always was, except for the rhythmic hum of her trusty work truck, the relentless drone of the wind, and the silent companionship of the highway itself.

**Setting:** The desolate, sun-baked stretch of Interstate 80, somewhere in the American Southwest.  The time is just before dawn, a time when the desert air is still and the world is quiet before the relentless rhythm of traffic begins.
