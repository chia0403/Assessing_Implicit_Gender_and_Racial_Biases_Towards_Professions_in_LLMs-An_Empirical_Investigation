The fluorescent hum of the truck stop's diner buzzed like a trapped beehive, a counterpoint to the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Reginald "Red"  McIntyre's heart.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the "Truckers' Oasis," blurring the neon glow of the sign.  Red, a grizzled trucker with eyes that held the stories of a thousand miles and a perpetually tired smile, stared at the chipped Formica tabletop.  A half-eaten plate of greasy diner food sat before him, untouched.  His truck, the "Iron Horse,"  stood silhouetted against the stormy sky, a lonely sentinel guarding the endless highway just beyond the diner's parking lot.

The year was 1987. The setting was a deserted truck stop in the heart of the American Midwest, somewhere between the cornfields of Iowa and the rolling hills of Missouri.  A biting wind whipped through the empty parking lot, carrying with it the scent of diesel and damp earth.   The truck stop, usually a cacophony of trucker chatter and the clang of loading docks, was eerily quiet. This particular night felt heavy, thick with an unspoken premonition, a feeling Red couldn't quite shake.
