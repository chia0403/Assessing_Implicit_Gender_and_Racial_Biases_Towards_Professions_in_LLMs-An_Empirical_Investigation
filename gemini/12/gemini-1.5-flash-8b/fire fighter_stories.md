The biting wind whipped around Lieutenant Amelia "Amy" Hayes, stinging her cheeks and tugging at the collar of her fire-resistant jacket.  Snow, thick and unforgiving, coated the already desolate landscape.  The town of Havenwood, nestled deep within the Cascade Mountains, was a ghostly silhouette against the bruised purple sky.  A single, flickering streetlight cast long, dancing shadows that seemed to mock the silence.  The air, heavy with the scent of pine and impending disaster, held the faint, acrid tang of smoke.  Amy, her breath clouding in the frigid air, squinted at the flickering glow emanating from the distant, skeletal remains of what had once been a cozy cabin.  This wasn't just a fire; it was a testament to the fury of winter's wrath.  The mountain winds had been howling all night, carrying embers and snow into the valley. This one had gone beyond mere accident.  It felt deliberate, almost malicious. The entire crew felt it.
