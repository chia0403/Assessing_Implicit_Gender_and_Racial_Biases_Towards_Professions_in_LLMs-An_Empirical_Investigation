The greasy air hung thick and sweet with the scent of burnt oil and cheap coffee.  Sunlight, fractured and distorted by the grime-coated windows, illuminated dust motes dancing in the haze.  This was the workshop of Bartholomew "Barty" Higgins, a haven of whirring gears, clanging metal, and the rhythmic clank of hammers against steel.  Barty, a man whose weathered hands spoke volumes of countless hours spent coaxing life back into sputtering engines, hunched over a mangled Honda Civic.  The car, a victim of a particularly aggressive pothole, lay on its side, its once pristine white paint now a patchwork of scuffs and scrapes, mocking the pristine stainless steel tools scattered across the workbench.  Today, the rhythmic thump of a relentless drumbeat from the street outside seemed to reverberate through the very soul of the workshop, a jarring counterpoint to the usually peaceful symphony of engine repair.
