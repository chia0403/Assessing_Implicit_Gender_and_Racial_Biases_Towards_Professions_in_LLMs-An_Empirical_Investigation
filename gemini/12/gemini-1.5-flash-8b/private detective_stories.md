Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the "Rusty Mug" diner, mirroring the relentless drumming in Amelia "Ace" Cavendish's temples.  The air, thick with the smell of stale coffee and desperation, hung heavy in the small, smoky room.  Outside, the neon sign of the "Crimson Comet" motel flickered erratically, casting long, dancing shadows across the rain-slicked street.  This was Blackwood, a town swallowed by the pines, a place where secrets were as thick as the fog clinging to the mountains in the early morning.

Ace, a private investigator with eyes as sharp as broken glass and a reputation as notorious as the town's dilapidated bridge, nursed a lukewarm black coffee.  Her worn leather briefcase, a constant companion, sat beside her, heavy with the weight of the case that had brought her to this forgotten corner of the state.  The flickering fluorescent lights cast harsh shadows on the chipped Formica table, highlighting the smudged lipstick stain on the corner of a napkin and the half-eaten plate of greasy diner food.  This wasn't her finest hour. The case was a convoluted mess involving a missing heir, a hidden fortune, and a suspicious family of timber barons who seemed to own Blackwood.
