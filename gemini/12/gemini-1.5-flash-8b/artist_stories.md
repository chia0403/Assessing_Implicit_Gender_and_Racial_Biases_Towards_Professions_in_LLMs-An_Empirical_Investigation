Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the "Artist's Retreat," a dilapidated shack perched precariously on a windswept hill overlooking the desolate, ochre-coloured plains of the Dust Bowl.  Dust motes danced in the fractured light filtering through the gaps in the roof, illuminating the cluttered interior.  Amelia Juniper, a young artist with eyes the colour of stormy skies and hands perpetually stained with earth pigments, hunched over a canvas propped against a wobbly easel.  Her palette, a chipped porcelain affair, sat beside a half-empty mug of lukewarm tea, its steam barely visible in the frigid air. Outside, the wind howled a mournful symphony, mirroring the turmoil within Amelia's soul.  The year was 1938.
