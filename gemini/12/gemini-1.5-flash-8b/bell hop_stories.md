The brass bell, polished to a mirror sheen, seemed to hum with a low, insistent vibration as Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, bellhop extraordinaire at the Grand Zenith Hotel, meticulously arranged a stack of freshly laundered linen.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the massive, ornately carved oak door of the reception area.  The Grand Zenith, a gothic masterpiece of sculpted stone and stained glass, stood sentinel over the sprawling, fog-shrouded city of Aethelgard.  A chill permeated the cavernous lobby, a stark contrast to the bustling marketplace that lay just beyond the hotel's imposing walls.  The air hung thick with the scent of roasting chestnuts and damp earth.  Each creak of the polished wooden floorboards, each distant clang of a blacksmith's hammer, seemed to echo the ceaseless rhythm of Barty's heart.  He was, despite his polite smile and impeccably pressed uniform, profoundly restless.
