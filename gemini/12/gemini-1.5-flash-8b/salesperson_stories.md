Rain lashed against the plate-glass windows of the "Evergreen Estates" model homes, blurring the already-saturated landscaping.  The rhythmic drumming echoed the frantic beat of Amelia Blackwood's heart.  It wasn't the downpour, however, that was making her palms sweat.  It was the prospect of another rejection, another empty promise of a sale.  She adjusted the perfectly-creased tie of her charcoal-grey suit, a small, futile act to calm the tremor in her hands.  The cavernous model home, a gleaming testament to modern minimalism, felt suffocating, a stark contrast to the tempest outside.  Sunlight, filtered through the rain-streaked glass, cast an unnatural glow on the pristine kitchen, highlighting the dust motes swirling in the air.  Amelia, a seasoned salesperson for "Homestead Builders," had been diligently showing off the spacious layouts and top-of-the-line appliances, but the potential buyers, Mr. and Mrs. Henderson, remained stubbornly silent.  Their faces, etched with a mixture of apprehension and indecision, seemed to reflect the very anxieties swirling in Amelia's mind.  This was their third viewing of the "Aspen Crest" model, and every time, the same disheartening conclusion seemed imminent.
