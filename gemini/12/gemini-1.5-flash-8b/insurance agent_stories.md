The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Assured Futures" office hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia Blackwood's anxieties.  Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of the third-floor office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  The year was 1987.  Amelia, a young insurance agent with a sharp, almost brittle, exterior, stared at the overflowing paperwork on her desk.  Claims for flooded basements, hail-damaged roofs, and a particularly nasty case of fire damage to a vintage bookstore, were piled high like a miniature Everest.  Her boss, Mr. Grimshaw, a man whose tie always seemed to be one precarious knot away from a full-blown crisis, paced behind her desk, muttering about the looming "perfect storm" of claims.  Amelia, who knew better than to question Mr. Grimshaw's dramatic pronouncements, simply sighed. The relentless workload was a suffocating blanket that threatened to consume her.  The office, a small, cramped space on a bustling street corner in downtown Baltimore,  was a vortex of stress, the air thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. Outside, the city roared with a life that seemed completely oblivious to the storm raging within the small insurance office.
