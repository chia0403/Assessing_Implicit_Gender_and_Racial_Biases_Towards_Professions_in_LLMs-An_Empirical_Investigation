The flickering neon sign of the "Golden Gauntlet" bar cast a sickly yellow glow across the rain-slicked cobblestones of  Old Market Square.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron awning above Amelia "Sparky"  Fitzwilliam's head, a relentless percussion against the hum of the city.  Sparky, a wiry woman with grease-stained fingers and eyes that seemed to see through the flickering lights, crouched beside a sputtering transformer box.  She wasn't afraid of the dark, but the relentless drizzle did tend to make the cramped, subterranean alleyways of the old city feel claustrophobic.  Her worn leather jacket, patched and reinforced with countless scraps of electrician's tape, was plastered to her skin.  Inside the box, copper wires snaked like petrified serpents, their insulation cracked and brittle in the damp. This particular alley, a forgotten cul-de-sac behind the market stalls, smelled faintly of mildew and stale beer. It was here, amidst the rhythmic pitter-patter of the downpour, that Sparky's fortunes, or lack thereof, were often decided.
