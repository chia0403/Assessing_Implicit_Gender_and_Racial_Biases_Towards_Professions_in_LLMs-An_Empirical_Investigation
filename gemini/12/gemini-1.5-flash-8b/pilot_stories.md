The biting wind whipped at Amelia "Amy"  Everhart's flight jacket, stinging her cheeks and frosting her breath into a hazy cloud.  Below, the jagged peaks of the Himalayas clawed at a bruised, cerulean sky.  Amy, co-pilot of the Zephyr 7, wrestled the controls, her knuckles white against the smooth, cold metal.  The mountain air, thin and unforgiving, pressed against the pressurized cockpit, a constant reminder of the altitude and the treacherous terrain she was navigating.  The Zephyr 7, a sleek, silver bird, danced precariously above a valley shrouded in perpetual twilight, a vast chasm swallowing the light.  The only sound besides the roar of the turbines was the rhythmic thump of her own heart, a frantic drumbeat echoing in the confines of the cockpit.  This wasn't a sightseeing flight; this was a mission.  A mission that had already cost her the lives of her crew in a previous, failed attempt.  And now, the fate of the expedition rested entirely on her shoulders.
