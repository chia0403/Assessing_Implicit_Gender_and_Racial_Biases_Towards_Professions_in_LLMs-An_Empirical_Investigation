The flickering neon sign of the Rusty Mug cast a sickly yellow glow on Elara Evangeline Thorne's face, highlighting the faint stubble that had begun to sprout on her chin.  Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof, mimicking the relentless drumming in her temples.  Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of stale beer, cheap cigarettes, and desperation.  The Rusty Mug, tucked away in the back alleys of a sprawling port city, was a place where whispered secrets mingled with the clinking of glasses and the low hum of conversation.  Tonight, the whispers were especially potent.  Elara, despite the late-night haze that always clung to the bar, felt a peculiar tension in the air, a palpable sense of something brewing, something about to spill over.  She ran a hand through her dark, slightly tangled hair, the same hair that had never quite mastered the art of a neat updo, and sighed, a sound barely audible above the rhythmic clatter of the bar.  Her resolve, usually a bedrock of steel, felt surprisingly malleable.  This was going to be a long night.
