Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the precinct station, a relentless drumbeat that mirrored the frantic rhythm of Officer Amelia "Amy" Hayes' thoughts.  The air hung thick with the smell of damp earth and stale coffee, a familiar aroma that tonight held a particularly acrid undertone.  The small town of Havenwood, nestled deep within the whispering pines of the Cascade Mountains, usually exuded a comforting quietude. Tonight, however, that quiet was fractured, replaced by a tense, almost palpable dread.

The setting: Havenwood, Washington.  A town of roughly 3,000 souls, Havenwood clung to the side of a mountain, its streets winding like paths through a verdant tapestry.  The towering pines, draped in heavy rain-slicked branches, cast long shadows that stretched and twisted across the narrow, cobblestone streets.  The precinct station, a squat, weathered building, was the only structure that dared to stand out against the grandeur of the surrounding forest.  Its single flickering fluorescent light seemed to cast an eerie glow over the sparse furniture and even sparser staff.  The air, usually crisp and clean, felt oppressive tonight.
