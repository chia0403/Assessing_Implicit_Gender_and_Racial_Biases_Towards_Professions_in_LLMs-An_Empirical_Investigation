The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's crimson scarf around her neck, a stark contrast to the muted greys and browns of the November landscape.  She squinted, her breath clouding the air as she surveyed the overgrown wilderness that had been the meticulously manicured gardens of Oakhaven Manor just a week ago.  The estate, once a testament to opulent floral displays and perfectly sculpted hedges, now resembled a neglected beast, its emerald heart devoured by encroaching weeds and skeletal branches.  Amelia, owner of "Emerald Green Landscapes," knew the task ahead would be monumental, the sheer scale of the devastation daunting even to her seasoned eye.  

The setting was Oakhaven Manor, a sprawling, ivy-clad estate nestled deep within the rolling hills of the Cotswolds.  Rain-slicked cobblestones and darkened, looming silhouettes of ancient oaks framed the sprawling grounds.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, hung heavy and melancholic.  A single, flickering gas lamp cast long, distorted shadows across the overgrown lawn, illuminating the scattered remnants of broken topiary and shattered flower pots, ghostly echoes of a life long gone.
