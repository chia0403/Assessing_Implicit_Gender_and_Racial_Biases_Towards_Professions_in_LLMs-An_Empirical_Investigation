The biting wind whipped Amelia "Em" Harrison's hardhat around her head, stinging her cheeks like a thousand tiny needles.  The skeletal framework of the new Zenith Tower, a gleaming monument to modern architecture, scraped the bruised purple twilight sky.  Around her, the construction site was a chaotic symphony of clanking metal, roaring engines, and the rhythmic clang of hammers.  Dust motes danced in the fading light, painting the air in a hazy, sepia-toned film.  Em, her breath misting in the frigid air, surveyed the scene.

The towering steel beams that composed the structure seemed to mock her solitary position, their cold, unyielding strength a stark contrast to the fleeting warmth of the sun that had long since retreated behind the ominous clouds. This was her domain, her battlefield.  A war waged against gravity and time, brick by brick, steel by steel.
