The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Drain Devils" plumbing shop cast long, greasy shadows across the worn linoleum floor.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless percussion that seemed to echo the frantic beat of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's heart.  Barty, a lanky plumber with perpetually smudged grease paint and a mop of unruly brown hair, hunched over a meticulously drawn diagram of a subterranean plumbing system.  His brow was furrowed, his pencil poised over a particularly knotty intersection of pipes.  The diagram, a testament to his meticulousness, was marked with various coloured highlighter pens, each representing a different phase of the suspected leak.  The smell of copper and mildew, a familiar comfort to him, hung heavy in the air, punctuated by the occasional metallic shriek of the antiquated plumbing tools scattered across the workbench.  Today, however, the usual hum of frustrated customers and the rhythmic clang of wrenches felt particularly tense.  This wasn't just another leaky faucet; this was a mansion, a historic landmark with a reputation for peculiar problems, and Barty was the only plumber bold enough—or foolish enough—to take on the challenge.
