The chipped paint on the windowsill, the same faded blue as Amelia Blackwood's cardigan, reflected the grey London sky.  Rain hammered against the slate roof of the small, terraced house, a relentless percussion that echoed the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Amelia's heart.  She stood in the cramped hallway of 27 Ashworth Road, the air thick with the scent of damp earth and something faintly metallic, like old pennies.  Her reflection, blurred by the rain-streaked glass, showed a woman etched with the weariness of a thousand whispered anxieties.  Amelia Blackwood, occupational therapist, was about to embark on a case unlike any she'd encountered before.

This wasn't a sprained ankle, a broken arm, or a stroke rehabilitation program.  This was a case of the soul, a splintered, fragmented thing requiring painstaking piecing together.  The client, an enigmatic woman named Eleanor Vance, lived on the top floor of the house, a recluse cloistered within the confines of her own carefully constructed world.  Eleanor was a woman wrapped in a silence thicker than the London fog, a woman shrouded in shadows that danced and shifted with the ever-present flicker of the flickering streetlights.  Amelia knew, with a chilling certainty, that this case would demand more than just adaptive equipment and therapeutic exercises. It would demand empathy, and an unflinching resolve to unravel a web of secrets woven into the very fabric of the house itself.
