The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow on Amelia Blackwood's face, highlighting the exhaustion etched into her tired eyes.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, mimicking the relentless rhythm of the clattering dishes and the hushed murmur of conversations that filled the small, smoky tavern.  Amelia, a server at the Rusty Mug for the past three years, felt the familiar weight of the night pressing down on her.  Tonight, more than most, the air hung thick with unspoken anxieties, a premonition of trouble brewing, just as it had every Tuesday for the past month.  The patrons, usually jovial and boisterous, were subdued, their whispers carrying the weight of secrets and simmering resentments. This Tuesday, the usual Tuesday night regulars had a peculiar mood. The smell of woodsmoke clung to the air.  The dimly lit room was crammed with rough-hewn tables, their surfaces scarred and polished with years of spilled ale and whispered agreements.  Outside, a biting wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the ancient oak trees that ringed the small town of Oakhaven.  The only sound louder than the rain was the persistent ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner, a metronome counting down the minutes until the inevitable reckoning.
