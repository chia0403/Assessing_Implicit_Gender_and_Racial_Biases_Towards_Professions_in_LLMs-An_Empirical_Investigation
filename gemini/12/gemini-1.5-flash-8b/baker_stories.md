The aroma of freshly baked sourdough, a symphony of tangy yeast and toasted flour, hung heavy in the air, clinging to the chipped paint of the bakery walls and the worn wooden tables.  Rain lashed against the awning of "The Golden Crust," a small, unassuming bakery tucked away on a side street of the perpetually overcast city of Aethelgard.  It was a Tuesday, a day most people in Aethelgard chose to hunker down with mugs of spiced cider and blankets.  But not Elara Oakhaven, baker extraordinaire, the one who coaxed perfection from the simplest of ingredients.

Elara Oakhaven, her auburn braid pulled tight against the damp chill, kneaded a ball of dough with practiced hands. The rhythmic thrum of the mixing bowl against the wooden countertop was a counterpoint to the insistent drumming of the rain.  Each fold, each stretch, each turn, was a silent prayer to the Goddess of Flour, a silent promise of warmth and comfort to the hungry souls who would soon seek solace in her creations.  Outside, the city sighed with the melancholic rustle of the wind-swept leaves.
