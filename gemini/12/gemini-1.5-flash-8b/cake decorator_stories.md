The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual caramel hue, reflected the flickering gaslight above Amelia "Amy" Butterfield's cluttered kitchen.  Flour dusted everything: the worn wooden countertop, the chipped ceramic mugs, even the chipped paint on the window frames.  Outside, a biting November wind howled through the skeletal branches of the ancient oak tree, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Amy.  Her atelier, nestled within the cobbled alleyways of the old quarter of Veridia, was a symphony of stifled whispers, the clatter of spatulas against metal, and the faint, sugary scent of vanilla and rosewater.  Today, however, only the rhythmic scratching of her pencil on parchment paper broke the silence. She was tasked with crafting a confectionary masterpiece: a wedding cake for the formidable Lady Isolde de Montaigne, a woman whose reputation was as formidable as her dowry.  Amy, a cake decorator renowned throughout Veridia for her exquisite, often fantastical creations, felt a knot of apprehension tighten in her stomach. Lady Isolde’s expectations, Amy knew, were legendary.  And this cake – a towering confection of sculpted buttercream roses and sugared lilies – was supposed to be the pièce de résistance.
