The scent of lilies, a heady mix of jasmine and something faintly metallic, clung to Amelia Blackwood's skin, even after she'd scrubbed her hands with soap that smelled of lavender.  The air in "Blooms by the Bay," her small but meticulously crafted flower shop, hung thick with the aroma of a hundred different blooms.  Sunlight, fractured by the stained-glass window depicting a soaring phoenix, painted intricate patterns on the polished mahogany floors.  A gentle hum of conversation, the soft clink of pottery, and the rhythmic whir of a nearby coffee machine created a symphony of quiet industry.  Today, however, that symphony was muted.  Amelia felt a prickle of unease, a premonition that the usual, comforting rhythm was about to be disrupted.  Outside, the waves crashed against the rocky shore of the Pacific, their constant roar a stark contrast to the contained calm of her shop.  Amelia, a woman of twenty-eight with eyes the colour of the sea and a shock of raven hair perpetually escaping its braid, glanced at the delicate porcelain clock on the counter.  It was 2:17 pm.
