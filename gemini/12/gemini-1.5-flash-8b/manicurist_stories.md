The chipped enamel of the chipped-off-the-counter-and-now-resting-on-a-heap-of-tissue-paper crimson was a stark contrast to the delicate lavender swirling across Anya Petrova's manicured nails.  Anya, a manicurist at "The Polished Petal," a nail salon tucked into the labyrinthine alleyway behind the Grand Bazaar, adjusted the lamp's angle, the soft hum of the fluorescent lights a constant counterpoint to the cityâ€™s rhythmic pulse outside.  Dust motes danced in the beams, illuminating a small, cluttered space crammed with tubs of iridescent polishes, nail files piled high, and the faint aroma of cotton candy and burnt sugar.  Each corner whispered stories of hurried appointments, whispered secrets painted onto fingertips, and silent dramas enacted between clients and the ever-changing hues of beauty.  Today, however, the only drama was the relentless, almost painful, quiet.  The only sounds were the steady click-clack of Anya's manicuring tools and the occasional sigh escaping the lips of a client lost in thought.
