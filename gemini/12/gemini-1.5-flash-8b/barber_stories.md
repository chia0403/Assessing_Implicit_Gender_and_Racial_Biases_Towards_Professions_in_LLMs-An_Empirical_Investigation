The scent of sandalwood and something faintly metallic hung heavy in the air of "The Razor's Edge," a small barbershop tucked away on a cobbled side street in the heart of Old St. Jude.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the grime-streaked window, illuminating a gleaming brass basin and a row of meticulously arranged razors.  Behind the mahogany counter, Bartholomew "Barty" Finch, a man with eyes the colour of a stormy sea and hands that moved with the practiced grace of a seasoned sculptor, meticulously trimmed the unruly mane of a plump, rosy-cheeked woman named Beatrice.  She sighed contentedly, a low rumble that echoed in the quiet shop, a sound that Barty had come to recognise as the sweet symphony of a satisfied client.  Today, however, a different kind of energy hummed beneath the surface of the shop's usual tranquility.  A faint, metallic tang mingled with the familiar scents, a subtle shift in the usual order of things that Barty sensed but couldn't quite place.  The silence was pregnant with unspoken anxieties. Outside, the rhythmic clanging of a nearby smithy seemed to pound against the very walls.
