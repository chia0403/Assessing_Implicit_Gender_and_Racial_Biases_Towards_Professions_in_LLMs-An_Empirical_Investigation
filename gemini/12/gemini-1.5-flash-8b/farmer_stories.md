The biting wind, a relentless rasp against Elias Thorne's weathered face, whipped the last of the crimson leaves from the ancient oak trees lining the valley floor.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of sun-baked earth, danced across the parched fields of the Thorne Estate.  Elias, a man whose hands, gnarled and strong, seemed to have absorbed the very essence of the land, squinted at the horizon, a thin line of bruised purple and grey against the bruised sky.  The year was 1887, and the drought had gripped the heartland with a cruel, unyielding grip.  Water, the lifeblood of the farm, was scarce.  Even the usually abundant creek that snaked through the valley had dwindled to a thread of muddy brown, barely enough to quench the thirst of the livestock.  His heart, like the parched earth, was heavy with worry.  His family, his livelihood, his very soul, were dependent on the rain clouds that stubbornly refused to part the sky.
