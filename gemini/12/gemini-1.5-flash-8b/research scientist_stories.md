Dr. Elara Vance, a biochemist with eyes that held the perpetual twilight of a northern forest and hair the color of burnt umber, stared at the petri dish.  Within, a swirling vortex of iridescent, bioluminescent algae pulsed with a hypnotic rhythm, a silent symphony of cellular activity.  Her cluttered lab, nestled within the shadowed depths of the University of Oslo's Department of Biological Sciences, was a testament to years of dedicated, often erratic, research.  Bookshelves groaned under the weight of scientific journals, overflowing with esoteric theories and cryptic notes.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of sunlight that pierced the gloom, illuminating a half-eaten bowl of granola and a chipped mug filled with lukewarm chamomile tea.  The hum of the lab's central cooling system was the only sound audible above the rhythmic pulse of the algae.  Today, however, the pulse was different.  It wasâ€¦faster.
