Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the Probation Department, mimicking the relentless drumming of Sergeant Alistair Finch's thoughts.  Alistair Finch, 32, with eyes the colour of stormy seas and a perpetually tired posture, stared at the flickering fluorescent light above his desk.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and the unspoken tension that clung to the worn, beige walls of the office.  He’d been wrestling with Case File 47-B, the latest entry into the overflowing basket of troubled youths, for hours.  The file, a dense compilation of infractions, missing court dates, and missed opportunities, felt like a physical weight pressing down on him.  Tonight, the rain seemed to mirror the tempest brewing inside him.

The setting was bleak, a far cry from the picturesque, suburban neighborhoods Alistair was tasked with navigating.  His office, located on the second floor of a city-center building, was crammed with overflowing file cabinets and the remnants of hastily consumed takeout.  Dust motes danced in the weak light, mirroring the uncertainty swirling around the lives Alistair was meant to guide. Outside, the concrete jungle of the city hunkered down, its towering buildings reflecting the grey gloom of the sky. This wasn’t the quiet suburban streets where he’d dreamt of helping people find a better path.  This was the underbelly of the city, where hope felt as fragile as the papery pages of the cases he reviewed.
