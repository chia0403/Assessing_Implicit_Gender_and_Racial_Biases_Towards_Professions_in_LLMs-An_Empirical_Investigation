The humid air hung thick and heavy, a tangible shroud clinging to the polished floors of "The Gilded Scissors."  Sunlight, fractured and hazy through the grimy cityscape outside, cast long, distorted shadows across the rows of salon chairs.  A delicate floral scent, a desperate attempt to mask the lingering smell of hairspray and desperation, hung in the air, mingling with the faint, metallic tang of blood.  This was Amelia Nightingale's world, a world of sculpted brows, vibrant hues, and whispered secrets.  Amelia, a cosmetologist with hands as precise as surgical instruments and a heart as complex as the intricate braids she fashioned, sighed, pushing a stray strand of dark auburn hair behind her ear.  The soft click of her high-heeled shoes against the polished floor was the only sound in the otherwise silent salon.  It was Tuesday, a day typically reserved for the overflow of boisterous brides-to-be, but today, a hush fell over the shop, a chilling anticipation that clung to the very air.
