The fluorescent hum of the waiting room, a monotonous drone punctuated only by the rhythmic *click-clack* of Amelia Kensingtonâ€™s high heels against the polished linoleum, felt like a physical pressure against her temples.  Amelia, D.C. (Doctor of Chiropractic),  slid into the worn leather chair behind her reception desk, sighing.  Another Tuesday.  Another tide of aches and pains, of slumped shoulders and stiff necks, washing over the small, cluttered office in the heart of a bustling suburban town.  The scent of antiseptic, always potent and slightly cloying, clung to the air, a tangible reminder of the physical toll of daily life.  Outside, the relentless summer sun beat down on the town of Oakhaven, the heat shimmering off the asphalt and casting long shadows across the meticulously manicured lawns.  Amelia knew the relentless humidity would compound the stiffness in her own back, a familiar, nagging ache that mirrored the complaints of her patients.  She wished she could escape the concrete and fluorescent lights, for a breath of fresh air and the scent of pine needles.


This was the life she'd chosen, though.  The life of precise adjustments and attentive listening, the life of helping others find relief from the invisible burdens society placed on their bodies.  And for now, she had to face another wave of patients, each with their own unique tales of discomfort, each needing a gentle hand and an expert touch to find their alignment.
