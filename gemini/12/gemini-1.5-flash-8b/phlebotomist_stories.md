The fluorescent lights of the "QuickDraw Diagnostics" clinic hummed, a monotonous counterpoint to the rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* of Amelia “Amy” Blackwood’s heart.  Amy, a phlebotomist with a perpetually tired smile and hands that moved with practiced ease, felt the familiar knot tightening in her chest.  It was Tuesday, and Tuesdays were always bad.  Tuesdays were the days the nervous energy in the waiting room seemed to amplify, the whispers around the reception desk more urgent, and the scent of antiseptic tinged with fear more pervasive.  The antiseptic smell today was particularly thick, clinging to the air like a shroud.

The clinic, tucked away on a side street in the bustling heart of Oakhaven, was a small, but well-worn, brick building.  Its drab exterior belied the high-tech equipment housed within its walls.  Dusty floral wallpaper clung precariously to the walls of the waiting area, a faded reminder of a time when the clinic was less a hive of medical anxieties and more a pleasant waiting room.  Rows of uncomfortable, beige plastic chairs faced a cracked, polished reception desk that reflected the fluorescent lights back into the eyes of the patients.  A flickering overhead light fixture cast long, dancing shadows on the floor, accentuating the silent tension that hung in the air.  The faint buzz of the automated phone system echoed, a constant reminder of the steady stream of anxious calls outside the walls of the clinic, and the subtle anxieties carried within.
