The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Silver Screen Studio" hummed a discordant symphony, a counterpoint to the frantic whispers that snaked through the cavernous editing room.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grimy window, illuminating a sea of discarded coffee cups and half-eaten takeout containers.  This was the den of Eleanor Vance-Harrington, a young, fiercely independent movie director, and the crucible where her latest film, "The Obsidian Mirror," was undergoing its final, agonizing transformation.  Eleanor, her face etched with the fatigue of countless sleepless nights, hunched over a massive editing monitor, her fingers dancing across the keyboard like a frantic conductor leading a dissonant orchestra.  Outside, the bustling city of Neo-Veridia thrummed with life, a stark contrast to the quiet desperation within the studio.  The year was 2242.
