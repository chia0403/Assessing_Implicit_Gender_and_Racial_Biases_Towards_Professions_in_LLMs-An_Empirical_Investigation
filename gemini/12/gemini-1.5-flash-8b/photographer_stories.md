The biting wind whipped Amelia "May" Carmichael's camera bag tighter against her chest, stinging her cheeks with icy pellets.  Above, the jagged peaks of the Austrian Alps, cloaked in a swirling grey mist, seemed to press down on the valley floor, a suffocating blanket of impending doom.  May, a freelance photographer known for her breathtaking landscapes, huddled deeper into the thick wool of her coat, the tiny, vibrating click of her camera her only companion in the surreal stillness.  She was on the final leg of a month-long trek through the Dolomites, documenting the raw beauty and untamed power of the mountains, a beauty that often hid beneath layers of gloom.  Her current assignment, a series on the region's forgotten alpine villages, was proving particularly challenging.


The village of Val di Funes, nestled deep within a bowl-shaped valley, appeared like a lost relic swallowed by the encroaching fog.  Its weathered, timber-framed houses, painted in faded blues and greens, clung to the hillside as if clinging for life.  Twisted, gnarled paths snaked through the village, leading to hidden courtyards and dusty, forgotten streets.  Only the faintest wisps of smoke curling from the chimneys hinted at the presence of human life within these spectral walls.  This was a place where time had seemed to stand still, a place where the mountains whispered ancient secrets into the wind. May, driven by her fascination with the ephemeral nature of human existence, felt a palpable sense of melancholy.  It was a feeling the mountains themselves seemed to absorb and echo. The biting wind and the relentless mist amplified the sense of isolation, a fitting backdrop for the poignant stories she sought to capture.
