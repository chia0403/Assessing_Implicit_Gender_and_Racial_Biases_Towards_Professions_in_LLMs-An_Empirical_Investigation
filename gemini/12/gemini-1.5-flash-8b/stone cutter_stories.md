The biting wind whipped through the jagged peaks of the Silver Mountains, clawing at Elara Stonehand's threadbare tunic.  Dust, the colour of dried blood, swirled around her, coating the already grey stone of the quarry face.  Above, the hawk-like silhouette of a golden eagle wheeled against the bruised sky, a silent sentinel in this harsh, unforgiving landscape.  Elara, her name echoing the hardness of the mountain itself, braced herself against the wind, her calloused hands gripping the rough-hewn chisel.  Sunlight, fractured and weak, barely touched the vast, echoing emptiness of the quarry.  This was the heart of the Stoneforsaken Valley, a place where mountains groaned under the weight of ages, and whispers of forgotten gods echoed in the hollowed caverns.  Her life, and the lives of those who worked the quarry, were bound to this stone, a tapestry woven of sweat, hardship, and the relentless rhythm of the chisel against the rock.
