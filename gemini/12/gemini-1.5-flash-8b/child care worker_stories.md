The chipped paint of the playroom walls, a faded robin's egg blue, seemed to hum with the collective energy of six small bodies.  A symphony of squeals, shrieks, and the rhythmic clatter of Lego bricks filled the air.  Amelia Grace Hawthorne, her name a whispered secret among the toddlers, carefully monitored the chaos.  A small, well-worn, black notepad lay open on the brightly-coloured picnic table, filled with scribbled notes about each child's mood and preferences.  Sunlight, filtered through the dusty windowpanes, slanted across the room, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and highlighting the smudges of crayon on Ameliaâ€™s jeans.  She was a child care worker at Sunny Days Nursery, a small, community-based centre tucked away in the heart of the sprawling, grey suburbs of Willow Creek.  The neighbourhood, known for its neatly-trimmed lawns and identical houses, felt strangely muted compared to the vibrant energy contained within the four walls of the nursery.  Today, however, an unfamiliar silence had fallen over the room.  It felt heavy, a pregnant pause before the next storm of activity.
