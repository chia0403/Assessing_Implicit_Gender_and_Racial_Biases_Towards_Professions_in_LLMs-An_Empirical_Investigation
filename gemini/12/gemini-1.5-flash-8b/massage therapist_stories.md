Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of "Serenity Springs," the tiny massage parlor tucked away on a side street of the perpetually overcast city of Greyhaven.  Inside, Amelia Juniper, a massage therapist with hands as warm and gentle as the summer sun she rarely saw, was meticulously arranging scented candles and calming crystals on the massage table.  The air, already thick with the aroma of lavender and sandalwood, hung heavy with the quiet anticipation of a rainy Tuesday evening.  Ameliaâ€™s small, cluttered office, a testament to her eclectic personality, was bathed in the soft glow of a single, flickering lamp.  Bookshelves overflowing with ancient healing texts and self-help guides lined one wall, while a collection of dried herbs and fragrant flowers filled another.  A faint melody of classical music, barely audible over the drumming rain, drifted from a tucked-away corner.  Tonight, Amelia expected a quiet night, but a persistent tapping outside had started to break the stillness.
