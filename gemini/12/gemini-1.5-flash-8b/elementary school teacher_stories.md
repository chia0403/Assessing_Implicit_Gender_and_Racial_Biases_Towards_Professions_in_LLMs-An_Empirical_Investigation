The chipped paint on the walls of Miss Eleanor Ainsworth's second-grade classroom at Oakhaven Elementary hummed with a low, insistent thrum, a counterpoint to the frantic buzzing of a thousand tiny, excited voices.  Sunlight, filtered through the dusty panes of the west-facing windows, painted the room in a shifting mosaic of gold and emerald, illuminating the overflowing bins of construction paper, the half-finished clay dinosaurs, and the meticulously drawn landscapes sprawled across the desks.  Today, however, the vibrant chaos felt tinged with an unnerving quietude.  It was the day before the annual school field trip to the Whispering Woods, a day Miss Ainsworth had spent meticulously planning for weeks, a day that, she now suspected, might never come.

Oakhaven Elementary, nestled in the foothills of the Whispering Mountains, was a building of faded glory.  Its aged brick, once a warm ochre, now showed a multitude of grey scars.  The school felt more like a relic of a bygone era than a modern educational institution, its worn wooden floors echoing the footsteps of generations of students.  A faint, almost imperceptible, scent of pine needles and damp earth clung to the air, a scent that normally filled Miss Ainsworth with joy, a scent that now seemed to press down on her like an ominous premonition.
