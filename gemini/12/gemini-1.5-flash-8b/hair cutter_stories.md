The chipped Formica countertop gleamed under the harsh fluorescent lights of "Scissors & Smiles," a salon more accustomed to the scent of hairspray than fresh lilies.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sunbeams that sliced through the grimy windows, illuminating a tangle of crimson highlights and the exasperated sigh of Amelia "Amy"  Featherstone.

Amy, a woman whose own hair, a vibrant cascade of auburn curls, was currently held hostage in a messy bun atop her head, surveyed the battlefield.  Three clients, each with their own unique and often conflicting visions of perfect hair, occupied the three styling chairs.  Across from her, a man with the steely gaze and perpetually furrowed brow of a disgruntled accountant struggled to articulate the exact shade of “burnt caramel” he desired for his already aggressively blonde locks.  A teenager, a whirlwind of anxious energy, fidgeted with a miniature mirror, her brow furrowed in concentration as she compared the reflection to a slightly-too-perfect Instagram image.  And finally, a woman with eyes the color of stormy seas and a quiet intensity that sent shivers down Amy’s spine wrestled with a knot of tightly-braided hair, silently pleading with her reflection to be seen, understood.  

The aroma of antiseptic and stale coffee hung heavy in the air, a familiar symphony of salon life.  Amy, despite the chaotic symphony of demands and desires, felt a strange calmness settle over her. This particular Thursday afternoon felt like a microcosm of her life, a relentless dance between the unruly wishes of others and the quiet, determined need for order. The rhythmic snip-snip of scissors was almost a lullaby, a constant reminder of her purpose in this small, cluttered space.
