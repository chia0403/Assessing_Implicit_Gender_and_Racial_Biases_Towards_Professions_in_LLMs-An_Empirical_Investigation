The biting wind, a skeletal hand, clawed at Bartholomew "Barty" Hemlock's exposed skin.  He hunched deeper into the tattered, grey oilskins, his breath fogging in the frigid air.  The slate tiles of the ancient manor, Greystone Hall, felt like shards of ice beneath his boots.  Each precarious step was a calculation, a dance on a precipice between stability and the terrifying, silent drop.  High above the sprawling, snow-dusted Yorkshire moors, the wind howled a mournful dirge, echoing the unease that stirred within Barty.  He wasn't just another roofer on another treacherous job. This one felt… different.  This one felt… heavy.

**Setting:**

Greystone Hall, a vast, imposing manor perched on a windswept hilltop overlooking the Yorkshire moors.  The house, built centuries ago, had seen countless storms and seasons.  Its once-proud facade, now weathered and cracked, bore the marks of time and neglect.  Icicles hung like frozen daggers from the eaves, and the air, though crisp and biting, carried the faint scent of pine and damp earth.  A stark contrast to the looming, suffocating silence of the Hall itself.  The landscape was a panorama of grey and white:  a bleak, almost otherworldly beauty, only punctuated by the stark black silhouette of the lone, formidable roof that Barty was tasked with repairing.
