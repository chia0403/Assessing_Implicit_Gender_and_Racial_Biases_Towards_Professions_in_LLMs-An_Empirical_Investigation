The chipped paint of the Miss Amelia Peabody Kindergarten classroom, a faded robin's egg blue, seemed to hum with a low, almost imperceptible energy.  Sunlight, filtered through the dusty, floral-patterned curtains, dappled the colourful felt board depicting a fantastical forest.  A gentle breeze rustled the leaves of the miniature oak trees strategically placed on the windowsill, a comforting counterpoint to the quiet hum of children's whispers and the occasional, barely audible giggle.  This was Miss Amelia Peabody's kingdom, a sanctuary of brightly coloured blocks, plush stuffed animals, and the hushed magic of the preschool years.

Amelia Peabody, a woman with eyes the colour of warm caramel and hair the shade of spun honey, surveyed her charges.  The tiny humans, dressed in a dizzying array of bright and slightly mismatched outfits, were engrossed in their own little worlds, building towers of blocks, drawing intricate pictures with crayon, or quietly arranging miniature cars on a miniature tarmac.  It was a Tuesday morning, a day much like any other, yet somehow, today felt different. A strange, almost electric tension hung in the air.
