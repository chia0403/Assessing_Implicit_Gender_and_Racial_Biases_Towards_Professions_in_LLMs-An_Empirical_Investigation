The biting London wind whipped Amelia Kensington's sweat-soaked hair across her face as she surveyed the bustling park.  October leaves, a riot of fiery crimson and gold, danced in the air, swirling around the joggers, pushing the brisk walkers against the stone balustrade bordering the Serpentine.  Amelia, a petite woman with an infectious laugh and a surprisingly powerful physique, adjusted the strap of her water bottle and surveyed her class.  Ten figures, ranging in age from twenty-something students to retired couples, stretched, their faces etched with a mixture of determination and mild terror.  This was her signature "Urban Flow" class, and today's location – Hyde Park, on a crisp autumn morning – was a particular favourite.  The crisp air, the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, and the sheer scale of the ancient park around them were, Amelia felt, inspirational.  She felt the energy of the city around them; the rhythmic rumble of distant traffic, the distant cries of gulls. It was a symphony that resonated deep within her bones, mirroring the rhythmic flow of her class.  They were hers to guide, to motivate, to push, and today, she would help them conquer their autumn anxieties.
