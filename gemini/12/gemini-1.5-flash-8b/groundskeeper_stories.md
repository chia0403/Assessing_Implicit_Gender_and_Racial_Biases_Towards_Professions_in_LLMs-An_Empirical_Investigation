The biting wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks, rattling the chipped paint on the wrought-iron gates of Blackwood Manor.  Rain, a relentless curtain of grey, hammered against the sculpted stone walls.  Inside, nestled in the shadowed depths of the sprawling estate, lived Elias Blackwood, groundskeeper.  Elias Blackwood, a man hardened by years of battling the relentless Yorkshire weather and the meticulous demands of his task, hunched deeper into his thick, waterproof coat.  He squinted at the swirling mist, his breath fogging in front of him.  The manor, a gothic masterpiece built centuries ago, seemed to whisper secrets in the wind, its every creaking window a hollow eye gazing into the storm-tossed world outside.  The grounds, once vibrant with colour, were now shrouded in a monochrome grey, a stark contrast to the riotous hues that usually painted the rolling hills of Blackwood estate.  Today, only the persistent drip, drip, drip of the leaky gutters echoed the relentless drumming of the rain against the slate roof.
