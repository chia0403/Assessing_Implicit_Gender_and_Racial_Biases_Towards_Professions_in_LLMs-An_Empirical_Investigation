The chipped porcelain flamingo, perched precariously on the edge of Elsie Bloom's desk, seemed to mock her.  Pink plastic against a backdrop of grey November drizzle streaking the window of "Bloom's Budget Breaks," its garish cheerfulness felt particularly offensive this morning. Elsie Clementine Bloom sighed, the sound a muted trumpet against the incessant drumming of rain. Her travel agency, nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually empty storefront promising “Authentic Tibetan Cuisine” (Elsie suspected the only Tibetan thing about it was the name), was experiencing a distinct lack of bustling. Outside, the Manchester streets shimmered with reflected streetlights, the pavements slick and uninviting.  Inside, the only warmth came from the humming radiator and the faint scent of jasmine tea Elsie had brewed an hour ago, now lukewarm in its chipped mug. November was always slow, but this year felt different, a deeper chill settling in both the air and Elsie's bank account.
