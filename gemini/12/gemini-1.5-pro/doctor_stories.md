The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, stinging Dr. Elias Thorneâ€™s cheeks as he hurried along the cobbled streets of Wick, the northernmost town on Scotland's mainland.  Slate-roofed houses huddled together against the relentless grey sky, their windows glowing warmly against the encroaching dusk.  It was late November, and the short days offered little respite from the frigid air.  Elias pulled his thick tweed coat tighter around him, the scent of salt and peat clinging to the fabric.  He was on his way to the Caithness General Hospital, a squat, granite building perched on a hill overlooking the churning sea.  The flickering gaslights cast long, dancing shadows that seemed to writhe and twist with every gust of wind, giving the familiar streets an unsettling, almost sinister, air. Elias, however, had little time to dwell on the atmosphere. A telegram had summoned him from a rare evening at home, and a knot of unease tightened in his stomach.  He knew, with a grim certainty that came from years of practicing medicine in this remote corner of the world, that whatever awaited him at the hospital would be far more unsettling than the shadows playing tricks on his eyes.
