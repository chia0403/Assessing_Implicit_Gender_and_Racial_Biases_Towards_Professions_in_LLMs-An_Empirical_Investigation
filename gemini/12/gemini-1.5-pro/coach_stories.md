The biting November wind whipped around Amelia “Amy” Rodriguez as she surveyed the muddy, churned-up field.  Frost clung to the blades of grass, crunching under her worn leather boots. Floodlights cast long, skeletal shadows from the lone, creaking bleacher stand, illuminating the swirling mist that rose from the damp earth.  Eastwood High's football field, usually a vibrant green canvas boasting the school's proud Wildcat mascot, was tonight a desolate, rain-soaked testament to the brutal end of another losing season. Amy tugged her Eagles baseball cap lower over her brow, shielding her face from the relentless wind and, perhaps, the sting of another defeat.  It was late, well past ten, but Amy couldn't bring herself to leave.  Not yet.  Not while the ghosts of missed catches and fumbled handoffs still danced in the fog.  She, Amelia Rodriguez, the first female head coach in Eastwood High’s history, had promised herself, and the town, a winning season.  A promise she'd broken, spectacularly.
