Rain lashed against the arched windows of the Parisian apartment, blurring the already fading twilight into a watercolour wash of grey.  Inside,  Genevieve "Vivi" Beaumont shivered, despite the crackling fire in the ornate marble fireplace. The scent of damp plaster and aged velvet hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume in this grand old building on the Île Saint-Louis.  Vivi, her auburn hair pulled back in a loose braid, surveyed the scene with a critical eye. The apartment, once the jewel of a wealthy textile merchant, was now a chaotic canvas of half-unpacked boxes, draped dust sheets, and glimpses of faded grandeur.  Her latest project – restoring this Belle Époque masterpiece to its former glory – was proving more challenging than anticipated. Not because of the peeling wallpaper or the water-stained parquet flooring, but because of the client.  Madame Dubois, a former opera singer with a voice like shattered glass and a penchant for melodrama, was proving to be as temperamental as the Parisian weather.
