Rain lashed against the windows of Eleanor Vance's small office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  The scent of stale coffee and disinfectant hung heavy in the air, a familiar aroma that usually brought a sense of calm routine. Not today. Today, the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of the rain against the glass felt like an accusatory finger, drumming on the lies Eleanor had built her career upon.  Her office, nestled in the "Wellness Wing" of the prestigious Cedarswood Rehabilitation Center, overlooked a carefully manicured courtyard.  Usually, the vibrant green of the meticulously pruned hedges and the soothing trickle of the fountain provided a tranquil backdrop for her consultations.  Today, though, the courtyard was a blurred swirl of grey and green, mirroring the turbulent thoughts churning in Eleanor's mind.  She stared at the dripping leaves of a Japanese maple, its vibrant crimson muted by the relentless downpour, and a shiver ran down her spine.  Something was about to change. She could feel it in the damp air, in the restless wind, in the very marrow of her bones.
