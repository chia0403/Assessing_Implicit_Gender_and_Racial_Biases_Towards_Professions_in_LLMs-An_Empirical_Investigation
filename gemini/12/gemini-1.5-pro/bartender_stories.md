The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of The Rusty Mug, a rhythm that usually lulled Beatrice "Bea" Ophelia Fitzgerald into a sort of meditative state while she polished glasses.

But tonight, only the flickering neon sign of a beer maiden with inexplicably ruby-red eyes kept Bea company. The desert wind howled outside, whipping sand against the windows in angry swirls, and the only other sound besides the rain and wind was the mournful clink of ice melting in the bottom of Beaâ€™s own whiskey glass.
