Rain lashed against the grimy window of Isabella “Izzy” Diaz’s office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  Neon light from the Lucky Dragon Chinese takeout across the street painted flickering stripes across her worn desk, illuminating dust motes dancing in the humid air.

The peeling paint, the mismatched chairs, even the persistent aroma of stale coffee and desperation - they were all part of the charm, or at least that's what Izzy told herself when the rent was due.  Tonight, however, even the charm was wearing thin.  The rain had been falling for three days straight, matching the relentless ache in her head, and her only company was a half-eaten container of lo mein and the rhythmic drip, drip, drip of a leaky faucet.  It was the kind of night that made even the toughest New Yorker question their life choices.  And Izzy Diaz, despite her tough exterior, was starting to wonder if trading a steady paycheck for the unpredictable life of a PI had been a mistake. Just as she reached for another greasy noodle, a sharp rap echoed through the room, followed by the click of the door opening.  A silhouette framed by the dim light of the hallway hesitated in the doorway, bringing with it a gust of cold, damp air and the faint scent of jasmine.
