Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Beatrice "Bea" Flores's Ford Focus, mirroring the turmoil brewing inside her. The flickering neon sign of the "Lucky Clover Motel" cast a sickly green glow over the cracked asphalt parking lot, illuminating a collection of rusting pickup trucks and cars with dubious license plates.  Water pooled in potholes, reflecting the distorted light like miniature toxic lagoons.  Bea, her damp hair plastered to her forehead, checked the address on the crumpled paperwork one last time: 21B, Lucky Clover Motel, Highway 17, just outside the town limits of Dustbowl, Nevada.  It was almost midnight, and the desert wind howled a mournful tune around the dilapidated building. This was not how Bea envisioned spending her Tuesday night, but probation checks rarely adhered to a schedule, especially when they involved a former meth cook with a penchant for disappearing acts. Tonight's disappearing act belonged to Dale "Sparky" Higgins, and Bea had a sinking feeling this wasn't just a simple slip-up.
