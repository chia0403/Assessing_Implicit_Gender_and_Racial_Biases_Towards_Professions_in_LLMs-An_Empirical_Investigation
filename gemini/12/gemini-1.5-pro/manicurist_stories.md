This was Eliza Jane Peterson’s domain, a ten-by-twelve kingdom built on perfectly sculpted acrylics and precisely blended ombre fades.  The late October sun, weak and watery, slanted through the grimy front window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air like tiny, glittering fairies.  Eliza, perched on a rolling stool, meticulously applied a tiny rhinestone to Mrs. Garibaldi’s already heavily-bejeweled pinky finger. Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the loose panes of glass, but inside, the only sounds were the gentle scrape of the file and Mrs. Garibaldi’s breathless recounting of her granddaughter’s latest theatrical triumph in the school production of  "Annie."  Eliza, a woman who preferred the quiet precision of her work to the messy tangle of human drama, nodded and smiled at the appropriate intervals, her mind already envisioning the elaborate Halloween nail art she planned to create for herself that evening. Little did she know, the howling wind outside was a harbinger of something much more dramatic than a school play heading her way.
