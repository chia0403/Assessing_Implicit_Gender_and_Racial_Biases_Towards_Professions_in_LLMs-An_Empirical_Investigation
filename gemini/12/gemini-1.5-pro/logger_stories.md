The biting pre-dawn air, sharp and clean as a freshly-stropped axe, nipped at Elijah Jedediah Blackwood's exposed cheeks. Frost crunched under his heavy boots as he crossed the clearing towards the mess tent, the scent of pine and woodsmoke already thick in the air.  The sky above the Cascade Mountains, a bruised purple bleeding into pale orange, promised a clear, cold day.  Camp Hemlock, a temporary settlement hacked out of the old-growth forest, was slowly stirring.  A symphony of sounds, the clang of cookware, the muttered curses of men waking to stiff joints, and the rhythmic wheeze of the generator, replaced the quiet whisper of the forest.  Elijah, a man built like an oak, with hands the size of dinner plates and a beard the color of cedar bark, was already thinking of the towering Douglas fir he'd marked the day before, its trunk thicker than a wagon.  He’d named it Goliath, and felling it would be a day’s work, a test of strength and skill that made his blood sing.  He just hoped Goliath wouldn’t sing back.  They said these woods were haunted.
