Rain lashed against the forty-foot windows of Elias Thorne’s office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside him.  The Chicago skyline, normally a glittering tapestry of steel and glass, was obscured by a curtain of grey.  Fifty stories below, the relentless thrum of traffic on LaSalle Street was muted, swallowed by the storm.  Elias, his tie loosened and his bespoke suit rumpled, stared at the plummeting numbers on his Bloomberg terminal, a knot tightening in his stomach.  It was October 29th, 2028, and Black Tuesday was back, only this time, it felt personal.  The market wasn’t just correcting; it was collapsing, taking with it the fortunes of his clients, his firm, and everything Elias Thorne had spent his life building.
