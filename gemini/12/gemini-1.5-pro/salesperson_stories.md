The stale, recycled air of the O'Hare International Airport terminal hung heavy around Beatrice "Bea" Cartwright.  Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the worn linoleum floor. Bea, clutching her well-worn briefcase and a lukewarm coffee, shifted her weight from one aching foot to the other.  It was 6:17 am on a blustery Chicago morning in late November, and the only thing colder than the wind whipping outside was the dread churning in her stomach.  Today, Bea was flying to Boise, Idaho to try and close the biggest deal of her career â€“ selling a fleet of industrial-grade snowplows to the Idaho Department of Transportation.  It was make-or-break for her fledgling career at Blizzard Bros. Snow Removal Equipment, and the pressure felt like an icy hand gripping her throat.
