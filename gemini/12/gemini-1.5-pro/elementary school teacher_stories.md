The late afternoon sun, filtered through the dusty Venetian blinds of Mrs. Eleanor Vance's third-grade classroom, cast long stripes across the worn linoleum floor.  Room 3B at Maplewood Elementary, nestled in the heart of drowsy Oakhaven, Ohio, usually buzzed with the frenetic energy of eight-year-olds. Today, however, a peculiar stillness hung in the air, punctuated only by the rhythmic ticking of the oversized clock above the chalkboard and the faint rustle of Mrs. Vance gathering her things. The last student had departed an hour ago, leaving behind the lingering scent of Elmer's glue and the faint echo of their laughter.  A single, crumpled drawing of a three-headed monster lay forgotten beneath a desk, a testament to the day's creative endeavors.  Outside, the first tentative chirps of crickets heralded the approach of twilight.  Something felt different, off.  Eleanor couldn't quite put her finger on it, but a prickle of unease ran down her spine, a feeling as unsettling as chalk screeching across a blackboard.
