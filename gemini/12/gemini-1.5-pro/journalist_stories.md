Rain lashed against the grimy windows of The Harbour Herald office, blurring the already fading neon glow of "FISH & CHIPS" across the street.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and impending deadline.  Eleanor Vance, a journalist whose byline was more recognized locally than her face, tapped a chipped mug with a bitten-down nail, contemplating the blinking cursor on her computer screen. Saltwind, a fishing town clinging precariously to the edge of the North Yorkshire coast, wasn't exactly a hotbed of international news.  But tonight, something felt different. The rhythmic clang of a buoy bell against the hull of a trawler moored in the harbour usually lulled Eleanor into a state of drowsy productivity, but tonight it echoed with an unsettling dissonance.  The fishing boats were all in, unusually early, and huddled together like a flock of nervous seabirds.  Something had driven them back to shore, and Eleanor had a gut feeling it wasn't just the storm.
