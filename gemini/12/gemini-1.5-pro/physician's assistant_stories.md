The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorne, PA-C, as he hurried across the cobbled courtyard of St. Jude’s Memorial Hospital.  Gargoyles perched atop the gothic revival building leered down at him, their stony faces slick with a mixture of rain and sleet.  The wrought iron gates of the hospital, normally imposing, felt less like a grand entrance and more like the bars of a cage tonight.  Elias pulled his threadbare scarf tighter around his neck, the damp chill seeping into his bones despite the layers he wore. The sickly yellow glow from the gas lamps lining the walkway barely penetrated the dense fog rolling in from the nearby Lake Superior.  Duluth, Minnesota, beautiful in the summer, could be a brutal mistress in the late autumn, and tonight, she was in a particularly foul mood.  Elias had only been at St. Jude’s for six months, having traded the sunny skies of Arizona for the melancholic beauty of the North Shore.  He’d been chasing something elusive, something he couldn’t quite name, and so far, all he’d found was the cold.
