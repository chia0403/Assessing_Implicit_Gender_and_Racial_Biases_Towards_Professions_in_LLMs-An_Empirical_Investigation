The bell above the door of "Petal & Stem" tinkled, a fragile counterpoint to the rumble of a passing garbage truck.  Eleanor Vance, her fingers dusted with pollen from the morning's delivery of anemones, looked up from the arrangement she was crafting.  Outside, the November air hung thick and grey over the cobbled streets of Greenwich Village, leaching the colour from even the brightest storefronts. Inside, however, Petal & Stem was a riot of life. Buckets overflowing with sunflowers and lilies lined the walls, their vibrant hues chasing away the gloom. The scent of damp earth, cut stems, and a thousand different blossoms mingled in the air, a heady perfume that Eleanor had long since ceased to consciously notice. This tiny shop, nestled between a vintage bookstore and a high-end chocolatier, was her sanctuary, a world she'd built with her own two hands.  And today, on this particular dreary Tuesday, she had a feeling something was about to change.
