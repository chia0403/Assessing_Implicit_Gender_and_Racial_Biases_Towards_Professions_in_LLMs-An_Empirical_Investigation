The fluorescent lights of Northwood High hummed a monotonous B-flat, a soundtrack Amelia Hayes, the school's guidance counselor, had become acutely attuned to over her fifteen years at the institution.  Her office, a converted storage closet tucked away near the gymnasium, offered a panoramic view of scuffed lockers and overflowing trash cans, a microcosm, she often thought, of the teenage psyche. The September air, thick with the smell of floor wax and adolescent anxiety, seeped in through the perpetually cracked window.  This particular Monday morning, however, held a different tension.  The quiet before the storm, Amelia mused, rearranging the inspirational posters on her corkboard, a nervous tic she'd developed.  Little did she know, the storm wouldn't involve typical teenage drama, but something far stranger, something that would shake the foundations of Northwood High and test Amelia's dedication to her students in ways she never could have imagined.
