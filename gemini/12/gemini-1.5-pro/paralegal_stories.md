Around her, the office was slowly emptying, the clatter of keyboards and hushed phone calls giving way to the rhythmic swoosh of the automatic doors as her colleagues escaped into the stormy Thursday evening.  A half-eaten container of Thai takeout sat precariously on the edge of her overflowing desk, a testament to the urgency of the case currently consuming her life - the contentious and complicated divorce of billionaire tech mogul,  Jasper Vance.
