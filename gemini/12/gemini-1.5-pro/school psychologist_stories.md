The flickering fluorescent lights of Ashwood High's main office buzzed like trapped insects, a soundtrack that mirrored the anxious thrum in Dr. Eleanor Vance's chest.  Rain lashed against the large, grime-streaked windows, blurring the already dreary November landscape outside. Ashwood, nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, was a town that wore its hardships like a second skin, and the school, with its peeling paint and overcrowded classrooms, reflected that reality. Eleanor adjusted her tortoiseshell glasses, the familiar weight against the bridge of her nose a small comfort. This was her first year as a school psychologist, and Ashwood, with its complex web of poverty, opioid addiction, and generational trauma, was proving to be a baptism by fire.  Today, however, was different. The call from Principal Miller had been urgent, his voice tight with a tension that spoke of something more than the usual teenage angst or playground scuffle. "It's about Sarah Jenkins, Doctor," he'd said. "I'm afraid it's serious."
