The biting November wind whipped across the cracked asphalt of the Texaco station, sending a shiver down Eliza Jane Cartwright's spine despite her thick, grease-stained overalls. The "Open" sign creaked rhythmically above the single bay, its flickering neon reflecting in the icy puddles gathering around the pumps.  Eliza Janeâ€™s garage, "Cartwright's Clutches and Crankshafts," wasn't much to look at.  Nestled on the outskirts of Dustbowl, Texas, a town barely big enough to warrant a blinking yellow light, it consisted of the aforementioned bay, a cluttered office crammed with parts manuals and half-eaten bags of chips, and a rusting tow truck that coughed more than it hauled.  But it was hers. And in Dustbowl, where the only things more plentiful than tumbleweeds were broken-down pickups, it was just enough. This morning, however, the usual quiet was punctuated by an unsettling stillness.  Not a single car rumbled down Main Street, and even the usual chorus of prairie dogs seemed to have fallen silent.  Eliza Jane tightened her wrench, a prickle of unease rising in her chest. Something wasn't right.
