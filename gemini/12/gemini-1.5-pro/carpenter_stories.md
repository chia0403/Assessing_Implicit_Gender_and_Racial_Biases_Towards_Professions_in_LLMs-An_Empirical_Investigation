The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorne, stinging his cheeks and snatching at the brim of his worn felt hat.  Sawdust, stirred up from the pile beside him, danced in the frenzied gusts, momentarily obscuring the skeletal frame of the half-built barn.  Around him, the rolling hills of the Derbyshire Dales, usually a comforting tapestry of greens and browns, were muted by a layer of frost, the drystone walls crisscrossing the landscape like the veins on the back of an old man's hand.  Elias, his calloused hands thrust deep into the pockets of his thick woolen coat, surveyed his work. The barn, commissioned by the taciturn farmer, Johnathan Hemlock, down in the valley, was supposed to be finished by the first snowfall.  Judging by the iron-grey sky and the increasingly frantic dance of the wind, that deadline was fast approaching.
