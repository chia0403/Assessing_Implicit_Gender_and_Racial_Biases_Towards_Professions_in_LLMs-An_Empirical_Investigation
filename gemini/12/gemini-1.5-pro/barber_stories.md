The biting wind whipped down Elm Street, rattling the frosted panes of Elias Thorne's barbershop.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of bay rum and talcum powder, a stark contrast to the icy breath of February clinging to the outside world. Elias, his own breath fogging slightly in the warmth, meticulously stropped his straight razor. The setting sun cast long shadows across the checkered floor, illuminating the worn leather of the barber chairs and the brass gleam of the shaving mugs lined up like soldiers on a shelf.  The bell above the door jingled rarely these days â€“ the harsh winter had kept most of the regulars huddled by their firesides, leaving Elias in the quiet company of his own thoughts and the rhythmic rasp of steel on leather.  The small town of Havenwood, nestled deep in the Appalachian foothills, had always moved at a slower pace, but in winter, it practically hibernated. And Elias, like the town itself, seemed to be waiting for the thaw.
