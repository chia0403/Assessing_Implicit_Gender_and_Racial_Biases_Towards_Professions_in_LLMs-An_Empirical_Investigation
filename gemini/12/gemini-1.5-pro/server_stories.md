The flickering neon sign of the Starlight Diner cast a greasy, iridescent glow over the rain-slicked asphalt of Bleecker Street.  Inside, the air hung thick with the aroma of frying onions, stale coffee, and desperation.  Eleanor Vance, her nametag pinned slightly askew on her faded turquoise uniform, wiped down the sticky Formica countertop with a practiced, circular motion.  It was 2:17 am, the graveyard shift was dragging its heels towards dawn, and the only other occupants of the diner were a lone truck driver hunched over a bowl of chili and a cockroach exploring the sugar dispenser.  Rain lashed against the large front window, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Eleanor.  Tonight, everything felt heavier â€“ the weight of her worn-out shoes, the silence punctuated by the rhythmic drip of a leaky faucet, and the unspoken dread that clung to her like the scent of cigarette smoke.
