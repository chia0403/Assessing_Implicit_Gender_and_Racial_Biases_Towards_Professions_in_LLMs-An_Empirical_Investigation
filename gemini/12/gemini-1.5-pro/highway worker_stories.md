The pre-dawn chill, sharp and biting despite the late May date, seeped through Amelia “Milly” Reyes’s orange safety vest and into her bones.  Condensation beaded on the brim of her hardhat, blurring the already weak glow of the eastern sky.  Around her, the I-95 corridor just south of New Haven, Connecticut hummed with a low, restless energy.  The usual pre-rush hour trickle of tractor-trailers and early-bird commuters had begun, their headlights cutting swaths through the milky fog that clung stubbornly to the asphalt. Milly and her crew, a motley collection of weathered faces she’d come to know better than some of her own family, were tasked with patching a particularly nasty pothole that had claimed more than its fair share of tires and hubcaps in the past month.  The rumble of the approaching pavement breaker, a beast of a machine nicknamed "The Jawbreaker," vibrated through the soles of Milly's steel-toed boots, a familiar tremor that signaled the start of another long day.
