The November wind howled down Sycamore Street, rattling the antique stained-glass window of Dr. Eleanor Vance's dental practice. Inside, the air was warm, scented with clove oil and the faint, metallic tang of disinfectant.  Rain lashed against the glass, obscuring the view of the small, snow-dusted town square of Port Blossom, Maine.  Eleanor, her dark hair pulled back in a practical braid, tapped a gloved finger against an x-ray pinned to a lightbox. The image showed a complex network of roots, a molar stubbornly clinging to existence.  It belonged to Mrs. Agatha Periwinkle, a woman whose stories were as convoluted and intertwined as the roots themselves, and whose visits were invariably punctuated by lengthy digressions on the history of Port Blossom, from the Great Herring Famine of 1888 to the unfortunate incident involving Mayor Thompson's prize-winning pumpkin and a runaway goat. Eleanor sighed, a puff of air fogging the cold glass of the x-ray viewer.  This was going to be a long afternoon.
