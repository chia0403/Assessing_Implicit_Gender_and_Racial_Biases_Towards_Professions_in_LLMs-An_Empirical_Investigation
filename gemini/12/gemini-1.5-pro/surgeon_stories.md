The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne as he hurried across the cobbled courtyard of St. Jude's Hospital, the gothic arches looming above him like skeletal fingers against the bruised twilight sky.  Gargoyles perched on the rain-slicked stone, their grotesque faces seeming to mock the hurried pace of the medical staff rushing in and out of the revolving doors. Elias tugged his worn leather satchel closer, the weight of his responsibilities a familiar pressure against his hip. Inside, the hallowed halls of St. Jude's hummed with a low, constant thrum of activity â€“ the hushed whispers of nurses, the rhythmic beeping of monitors, the ever-present scent of antiseptic and something faintly metallic that clung to the very air.  Built in 1888, the hospital was a labyrinth of echoing corridors and dimly lit wards, a place where life and death danced a precarious waltz, and Elias, a renowned cardiothoracic surgeon, was often the lead choreographer.  Tonight, the music was particularly frantic.
