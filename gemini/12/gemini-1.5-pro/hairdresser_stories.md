The rusty bell above the door of "Shear Perfection" jingled merrily, announcing the arrival of Mrs. Periwinkle, clutching a crumpled coupon for a perm.  Rain lashed against the large front window, blurring the view of the grey North Yorkshire moors beyond. Inside, the salon was warm and brightly lit, a stark contrast to the dreary November day.  Eleanor Grace Hawthorne, her fiery red hair pulled back in a neat chignon, sighed softly and plastered a welcoming smile on her face.  It was another slow Tuesday in the sleepy village of Kettlewell, and the prospect of spending the next three hours wrestling Mrs. Periwinkle's wiry grey locks into submission wasn't exactly thrilling.  Still, rent was due, and a perm was a perm.  Eleanor gestured towards the worn leather chair, "Morning, Mrs. Periwinkle. Come in, come in, out of the cold."
