The wail of the siren was a lullaby to Amelia “Amy” Reyes. It thrummed through the chassis of Medic One, vibrating in her teeth as the ambulance bucked over potholes and roared through intersections bathed in the hazy orange glow of sodium vapor lamps. Rain slicked the streets of Philadelphia, reflecting the city lights back in a distorted, shimmering mosaic. It was 3:17 am, a time when most of the city slept, oblivious to the dramas unfolding in the hidden corners and darkened alleys.  Tonight’s drama, dispatched as a “man down, possible GSW,” was unfolding in the heart of Kensington, a neighborhood notorious for its open-air drug market.  Amy gripped the metal bar above her head, bracing herself as her partner, Marcus “Big Mac” McDonald, wrestled the ambulance around a double-parked car, the flashing lights painting fleeting portraits of the anxious faces peering from behind curtained windows. The air crackled with the static of the police radio, the dispatcher’s voice a monotone counterpoint to the escalating tension.  This wasn't Amy’s first rodeo in Kensington, but the gnawing unease in her stomach told her this one was going to be different.
