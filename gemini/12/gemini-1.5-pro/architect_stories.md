The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorne, architect extraordinaire, as he stood on the unfinished rooftop of the Zephyr Tower, the skeletal steel frame groaning a mournful song against the gale.  Fifty stories below, the lights of Chicago glittered like a spilled jewel box, reflecting off the slate-grey surface of Lake Michigan. Elias pulled his cashmere scarf tighter around his neck, the icy air nipping at the exposed skin of his face.  He wasn't supposed to be here. The site was officially closed for the night, locked down tight against the encroaching storm. But Elias couldnâ€™t stay away. Not tonight. Not when the nearly-completed Zephyr, his magnum opus, a symphony of glass and steel designed to kiss the clouds, felt more like a tombstone than a triumph.  Something was wrong. He could feel it in the unsettling sway of the structure, hear it in the whispers of the wind, a discordant note in the city's usual hum.  And he knew, with a chilling certainty, that if he didn't figure it out soon, the Zephyr, and perhaps everything he'd worked for, would come crashing down.
