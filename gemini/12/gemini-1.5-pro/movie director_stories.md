The biting February wind whipped around Esmeralda "Esme" Reyes as she stood on the precipice of the abandoned quarry, its jagged slate-grey walls a stark contrast to the bruised purple of the twilight sky. Below her, the quarry floor, a chaotic jumble of rusting machinery and half-collapsed structures, looked like the skeletal remains of a forgotten giant. This was her set. This was where Esme Reyes, a director known for her gritty realism and unflinching portrayal of complex characters, would attempt to bring her most ambitious, and arguably most personal, project to life: a neo-noir thriller titled "The Serpent's Kiss."  The isolated quarry, nestled deep in the Welsh countryside, mirrored the isolation of her protagonist, and the biting wind seemed to whisper the secrets the story held within its shadowed depths.
