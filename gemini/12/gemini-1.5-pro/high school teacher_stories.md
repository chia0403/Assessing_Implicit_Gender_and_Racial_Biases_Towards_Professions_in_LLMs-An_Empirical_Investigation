The fluorescent lights of Mr. Silas Blackwood's classroom hummed a monotonous B-flat, a soundtrack to the pre-dawn quiet of Ashwood High. Silas, his tie loosened and sleeves rolled up, surveyed the battlefield of desks.  Paper airplanes littered the floor like fallen sparrows, and a half-eaten apple core sat perched precariously on Shakespeare's collected works.  Outside, the October wind rattled the skeletal branches of a sycamore tree against the windowpane, casting long, skeletal shadows across the room.  Ashwood, nestled in the heart of Vermont's Green Mountains, was already bracing itself for the long, cold winter, and a thin layer of frost glazed the playing fields beyond. This was Silas's tenth year teaching English Literature at Ashwood, a decade marked by the rhythmic turning of seasons and the equally predictable cycle of teenage angst. But this year, something felt different. A disquiet hung in the air, thicker than the wood smoke curling from chimneys across the valley, a premonition of something about to break the sleepy routine of Ashwood.
