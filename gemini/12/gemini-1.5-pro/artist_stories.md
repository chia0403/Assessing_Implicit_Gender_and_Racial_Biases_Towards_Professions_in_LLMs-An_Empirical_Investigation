The salt spray kissed Elara Vivienne Moreau's face as she perched precariously on the jagged rocks overlooking the turquoise cove.  Her easel, battered and paint-splattered, stood defiant against the relentless wind, a wooden soldier guarding her canvas.  The late afternoon sun, a molten gold orb sinking towards the horizon, cast long shadows across the vibrant fishing village of Portmeirion, Wales.  Each brightly coloured house, clinging to the hillside like a cluster of jewels, pulsed with a life that Elara longed to capture, to translate onto the pristine white surface before her.  This was her haven, her escape from the suffocating politeness of London galleries and the stifling expectations of her family's legacy. Here, amongst the crashing waves and the cries of gulls, she felt truly free, a nameless artist wrestling with the light and the sea.
