The biting November wind whipped at Amelia “Milly” Hawthorne’s cheeks, turning them the same shade as the crimson Virginia creeper clinging to the wrought-iron fence she was repairing.  A brittle frost crunched beneath her work boots as she shifted her weight, the rusted hinge squealing in protest. Milly, her breath puffing out in white clouds, surveyed her handiwork with a critical eye.  The sprawling, neglected garden of Oakhaven Manor stretched before her, a tapestry of faded grandeur and encroaching wilderness.  Towering oaks, skeletal against the grey sky, cast long, skeletal shadows across the overgrown lawns, where once manicured hedges now resembled tangled green beasts.  A crumbling fountain, choked with fallen leaves and the occasional opportunistic weed, stood as a forlorn centerpiece. Oakhaven, a relic of a bygone era, perched precariously on the bluff overlooking the churning Atlantic, had seen better days, and so, Milly thought with a wry smile, had the fence.  This was her latest project, a reclamation of a forgotten beauty, a battle against the relentless march of nature. And, like every project before it, Milly intended to win.
