The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of Eldoria, carrying with it the fine, grey dust that coated everything in a perpetual film of grit.  Here, nestled against the base of the jagged, rust-colored cliffs known as the Devil's Teeth, lay the quarry town of Dustbowl.  It was a harsh land, unforgiving and bleak, where life clung precariously to the rock face, much like the lichen that stubbornly speckled the cliffs above.  This was the home of Elias Thorne, a stone cutter whose hands, calloused and scarred, were as familiar with the cold bite of granite as they were with the warmth of his meager hearth fire.  The sun, a pale, watery disc in the perpetually overcast sky, cast long, skeletal shadows across the quarry floor as Elias, his breath misting in the frigid air, prepared for another day's work. The rhythmic clang of hammer against chisel echoed through the still morning air, a mournful song in this lonely, windswept landscape.
