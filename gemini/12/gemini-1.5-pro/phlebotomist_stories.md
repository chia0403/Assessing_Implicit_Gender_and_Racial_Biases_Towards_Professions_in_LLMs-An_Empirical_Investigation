The pre-dawn chill seeped through the thin walls of Amelia Reyes's apartment, raising goosebumps on her arms despite the fuzzy robe she wore. Outside, the Chicago skyline was just beginning to etch itself against the bruised purple of the sky.  Amelia, whose full name was Amelia Sofia Reyes, yawned, a sound swallowed by the insistent buzzing of her alarm clock.  5:15 AM.  Another day, another round of drawing blood.  She was a phlebotomist at Mercy General, a sprawling, perpetually busy hospital in the heart of Lincoln Park, and her shift started at six sharp.  The thought of facing the morning rush, the symphony of beeping machines and hurried footsteps, rarely filled her with enthusiasm, but Amelia found a strange comfort in the predictable rhythm of her work. The steady routine, the precision required to find a vein, the quiet satisfaction of a successful draw â€“ these were the small victories that punctuated her days.  Today, however, a knot of unease tightened in her stomach, a feeling she couldn't quite place. It was as if the usual pre-shift hum of anticipation was replaced by a low, thrumming dissonance.
