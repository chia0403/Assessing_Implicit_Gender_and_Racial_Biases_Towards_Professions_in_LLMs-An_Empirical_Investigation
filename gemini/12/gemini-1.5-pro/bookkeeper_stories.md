The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Bartholomew & Sons Fishmongers, mimicking the frantic tapping of Amelia Grace Holloway's fingers on the keys of her ancient adding machine.  The air, thick with the briny tang of the day's unsold cod and haddock, clung to her like a damp shawl.  Saltash, a small Cornish fishing town perched precariously on the edge of the Atlantic, rarely saw a day without some degree of damp, but tonight felt particularly oppressive. Amelia, perched on her high stool behind a partition of frosted glass in the back office, shivered despite the muggy warmth.  The gas lamp above her desk flickered, casting elongated shadows that danced across the stacks of ledgers and invoices, making the columns of neatly penned figures seem to sway and blur.  Outside, the wind howled, a mournful keening that echoed the growing unease in Amelia's stomach. Something wasn't adding up, and it wasn't just the Bartholomew's accounts.
