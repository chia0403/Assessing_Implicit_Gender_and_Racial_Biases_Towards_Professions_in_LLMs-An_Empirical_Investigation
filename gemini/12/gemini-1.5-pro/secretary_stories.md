The rhythmic clatter of the Smith Corona echoed through the otherwise silent office, punctuated only by the occasional *ding* of the cable car passing on California Street far below.  Elara Josephine Bellweather, secretary to Mr. Archibald Finch, CEO of Finch & Sons Import-Export, paused her typing, her slender fingers hovering over the keys. The fog, a San Francisco staple even in July, had seeped into the ornate office, clinging to the mahogany furniture and swirling around the legs of the oversized globe in the corner.  The only illumination came from a single, brass banker's lamp perched precariously on Elara's desk, casting a warm pool of light onto the meticulously organized papers before her. It was 6:47 am, a full hour and thirteen minutes before Mr. Finchâ€™s expected arrival, but Elara preferred to arrive early. It gave her time to prepare, to anticipate, to ensure that the gears of Finch & Sons ran smoothly, a task she took immense pride in, even if her name was rarely mentioned beyond the confines of her small, wood-paneled office.  This morning, however, something felt different.  A low hum of unease thrummed beneath the city's usual morning symphony of distant foghorns and rumbling delivery trucks.
