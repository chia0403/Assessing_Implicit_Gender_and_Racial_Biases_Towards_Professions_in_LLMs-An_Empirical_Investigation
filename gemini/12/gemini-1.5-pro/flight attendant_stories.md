The stale, recirculated air hung heavy in the cabin, thick with the scent of lukewarm coffee and nervous perspiration.  Cassandra "Cassie" Moreau, her smile expertly plastered in place despite the gnawing anxiety in her stomach, navigated the narrow aisle of the Aeroflot flight from Moscow to Hong Kong. Outside, the inky black of a Siberian night pressed against the tiny oval windows.  The unsettling quiet, punctuated only by the gentle hum of the engines and the occasional sniffle from a passenger, was a stark contrast to the chaotic energy Cassie had just left behind in the bustling Sheremetyevo International Airport.  This particular leg of the journey was always the longest, the emptiest, and, in Cassie's opinion, the strangest.  It felt less like a flight across continents and more like a slow drift into another dimension.  A dimension where the flickering cabin lights cast long, dancing shadows that seemed to have a life of their own, and the faint chime of the call button echoed with an almost supernatural resonance.
