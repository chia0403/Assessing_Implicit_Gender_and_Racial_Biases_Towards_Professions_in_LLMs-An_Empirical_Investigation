The rusty diner sign, barely clinging to its post, creaked a mournful tune against the ceaseless Kansas wind.  It advertised "Stella's Starlight Diner - Pies Like Mama Made 'Em," though the only stars visible were the pinpricks of light struggling against the sodium glow of the truck stop across the highway. Inside, the air hung thick with the aroma of stale coffee and frying onions, punctuated by the sporadic clang of cutlery against chipped ceramic. Rain lashed against the window, blurring the already desolate landscape into an abstract wash of grey and brown. This was Bethany Mae "Betty" Calhoun's regular Thursday night stop on her route from Denver to Chicago, a ritual as ingrained as checking her oil or securing her load.  Tonight, however, something felt different. The usual comforting hum of conversation was absent, replaced by a low, unsettling quiet. Betty, a sturdy woman with hands calloused from years gripping a steering wheel, shifted uneasily in her booth, her gaze fixed on the flickering neon sign outside.  It wasn't the storm that unsettled her; Betty had weathered worse. It was the stillness, the heavy silence that seemed to press against the diner windows like a physical force, that prickled the hairs on the back of her neck.
