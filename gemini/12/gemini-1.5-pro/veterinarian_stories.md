The biting wind whipped off the Puget Sound, carrying the scent of salt and cedar, and stinging Dr. Eleanor Vance’s cheeks as she hurried across the rain-slicked parking lot.  The neon sign of the Bainbridge Island Veterinary Clinic buzzed faintly above her, casting a sickly green glow on the puddles gathering at her feet.  It was nearing midnight, a time when most of the island’s residents were tucked away in their cozy craftsman homes, dreaming of orcas and ferry schedules. But for Eleanor, the night was just beginning. A frantic call from Mrs. Henderson, a woman whose prize-winning Angora rabbit, Mr. Flufferton, had apparently decided to sample the contents of her cleaning cupboard, meant a sleepless night was in store. The clinic was small, just Eleanor and her perpetually exhausted technician, Javier, holding down the fort.  Inside, a single flickering fluorescent bulb illuminated the waiting room, casting long, distorted shadows of the empty chairs and the worn scratching post in the corner.  The air hung thick with the lingering smell of disinfectant and something vaguely… floral.  Eleanor shivered, not entirely from the cold.  Something about tonight felt different.
