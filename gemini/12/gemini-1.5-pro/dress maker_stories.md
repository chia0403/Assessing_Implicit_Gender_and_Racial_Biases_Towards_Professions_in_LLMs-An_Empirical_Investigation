The air in Madame Evangeline Moreau's atelier hung thick with the scent of lavender and the faint ghost of woodsmoke from the nearby bakery.  Sunlight, fractured by the leaded panes of the tall, arched window, painted a mosaic across the polished wooden floor.  Dust motes danced in the golden beams, illuminating the chaotic beauty of Evangeline's workspace.  Half-finished gowns draped over dress forms like ethereal sculptures, bolts of silk and lace cascaded from shelves, and a profusion of ribbons, beads, and buttons spilled from overflowing baskets.  Just beyond the atelier’s open door, the bustling sounds of the Parisian marketplace in 1888 – the cries of street vendors, the rumble of carriages, and the chatter of passersby – created a vibrant counterpoint to the quiet hum of Evangeline’s needle gliding through silk.  A single, perfect crimson rose sat in a chipped porcelain vase on her cluttered worktable, a splash of vibrant colour against the muted hues of her current project: a wedding gown of ivory satin so fine it seemed woven from moonlight itself.
