The sun, a malevolent eye in the bleached-blue Texas sky, beat down on Elias "Eli" Vance's back.  Sweat plastered his faded grey t-shirt to his skin, each movement a sticky reminder of the oppressive August heat.  Below him, the terracotta shingles of the sprawling hacienda-style house radiated heat like a kiln. Austin sprawled in the distance, a shimmering haze of concrete and glass, the air above it writhing in the midday glare. Eli adjusted his harness, the worn leather creaking a familiar song, and shifted his weight on the steeply pitched roof. The only sounds were the distant drone of traffic, the sizzle of the heat on the shingles, and the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of his hammer echoing in the still air. This was Eli's domain, a precarious kingdom of tar and shingles, and he ruled it with calloused hands and a squint that could gauge the pitch of a roof from a hundred yards. Today, however, the silence held a certain tension, a prickling unease that had nothing to do with the height or the heat.  Something feltâ€¦off.
