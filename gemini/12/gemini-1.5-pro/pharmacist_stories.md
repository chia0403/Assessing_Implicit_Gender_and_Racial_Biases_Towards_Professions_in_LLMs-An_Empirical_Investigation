The relentless Nevada sun beat down on the dusty asphalt of Harmony Springs, a town so small its only claim to fame was its proximity to Area 51, a fact exploited by the kitschy alien-themed gift shop across the street from Eleanor Vance’s pharmacy.  Inside, the air conditioning hummed a monotonous tune against the backdrop of gently clinking pill bottles. Eleanor Vance, her auburn hair pulled back in a severe bun, meticulously counted out metformin tablets, the late afternoon light catching the glint of her silver name tag. The pharmacy, "Harmony Springs Apothecary," a relic from a more prosperous era, was filled with the comforting scent of antiseptic and something faintly sweet, like old rose petals.  This Thursday, like most Thursdays, promised to be uneventful.  Eleanor anticipated the usual trickle of customers – Mrs. Henderson needing her blood pressure medication refilled, old Mr. Abernathy picking up his arthritis cream.  But the quiet jingle of the bell above the door heralded the arrival of someone new, someone whose presence instantly shattered the predictable rhythm of Eleanor's day.
