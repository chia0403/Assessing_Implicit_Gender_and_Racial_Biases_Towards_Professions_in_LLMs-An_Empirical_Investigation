The sticky, sweet scent of overripe bananas hung in the air, mingling with the faint, but ever-present, aroma of disinfectant. Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez sighed, pushing a stray strand of dark hair out of her eyes.  Sunlight streamed through the large windows of the Rainbow Rascals Daycare, illuminating a chaotic tableau: a tower of brightly coloured blocks teetered precariously near a group of toddlers engrossed in finger painting, while a chorus of shrieks and giggles echoed from the miniature play kitchen in the corner.  Located in a converted Victorian house on the outskirts of the sleepy town of Oakhaven, Rainbow Rascals was Amy's kingdom, a vibrant and often overwhelming domain ruled by tiny humans with boundless energy and even less impulse control. It was Tuesday, and Tuesday meant glitter, glue, and the inevitable grape juice spill that would stain the pale carpet a disconcerting shade of purple. Amy braced herself. It was going to be a long, but hopefully rewarding, day.
