The chipped, flamingo-pink rotary phone on Elsie Mae Higgins' desk trilled insistently, a shrill counterpoint to the gentle whir of the ceiling fan above. It was a sticky July afternoon in Harmony Springs, Mississippi, a town where time seemed to move at the pace of molasses dripping from a spoon. Elsie Mae, receptionist for the Harmony Springs Funeral Home and Pet Crematorium, sighed, pushing a stray curl of her auburn hair behind her ear.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight slicing through the Venetian blinds, illuminating the faint scent of lilies and formaldehyde that perpetually hung in the air. Outside, cicadas buzzed their relentless chorus, a soundtrack to the languid summer heat that pressed down on the small town like a weighted blanket.  Harmony Springs wasn't exactly bustling, but even for a Tuesday afternoon, the silence in the reception area felt heavy, almost expectant.
