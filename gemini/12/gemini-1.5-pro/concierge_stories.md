Amelia, a veteran of countless such events, maintained her composure, her smile unwavering as she fielded requests for restaurant reservations, theatre tickets, and the ever-elusive, perfectly-pressed suit in under an hour.  This was her domain, a world of meticulously orchestrated details and flawlessly executed requests, and within it, Amelia reigned supreme. But tonight, a different kind of request was about to disrupt her carefully balanced kingdom.
