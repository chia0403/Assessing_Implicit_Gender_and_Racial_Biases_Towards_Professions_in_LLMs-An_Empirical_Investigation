The biting wind whipped down Crown Street, rattling the frosted panes of Elias Finch's tailoring shop and sending a shiver through the single gas lamp that illuminated the interior.  It was December 1888 in Whitechapel, London, and the cobbled streets, normally bustling with vendors and their wares, were eerily deserted.  Inside, Elias, his spectacles perched precariously on his nose, meticulously stitched the final button onto a heavy wool coat.  The shop, small but meticulously organized, was filled with the rich aroma of freshly pressed linen and the faint scent of pipe tobacco, a comfort against the chill seeping through the ill-fitting door.  Shadows danced on the walls, cast by the flickering gaslight and the half-finished garments hanging on their hooks, lending an unsettling air to the otherwise cozy space. Elias, a man of precise habits and quiet demeanor, felt a prickle of unease, a sensation he usually attributed to the late hour and the recent unsettling events plaguing the district.
