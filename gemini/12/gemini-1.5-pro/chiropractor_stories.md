The neon "Open" sign in the window of Aligned Spine & Wellness buzzed faintly, a counterpoint to the rhythmic swoosh of the wipers battling the relentless Seattle drizzle. Inside, Dr. Elias Vance Kettering, his tie loosened and sleeves rolled up, meticulously cleaned the adjusting table. The scent of antiseptic mingled with the faint, earthy aroma of the medicinal herbs he used in his compresses. His clinic, nestled between a pho restaurant and a laundromat in the eclectic Ballard neighborhood, wasn't glamorous, but it was his.  Heâ€™d poured his heart, soul, and a frankly alarming amount of student loan money into creating a space where he could help people find relief from their aches and pains, a space bathed in the warm glow of Himalayan salt lamps and the soothing sounds of a meticulously curated Spotify playlist. Tonight, however, the only sound was the rain, and Dr. Kettering had a feeling it was a harbinger of more than just a typical Seattle downpour.
