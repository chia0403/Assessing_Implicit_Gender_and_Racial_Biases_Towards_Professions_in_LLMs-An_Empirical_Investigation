The biting Antarctic wind whipped Dr. Evelyn Reed’s auburn braid across her face as she wrestled the heavy steel door of the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station shut.  Inside, the relative warmth of -10° Celsius was a welcome assault compared to the -40° howling outside.  Evelyn, bundled in a Michelin-man thick parka, stomped the accumulated snow off her boots, the metallic crunch echoing in the cavernous entryway.  The faint hum of the station's generators and the distant clatter of machinery provided a constant, almost comforting background noise in the otherwise isolating silence of the polar plateau.  It was December 21st, the summer solstice in Antarctica, yet the sun, a pale ghost in the perpetual twilight, barely skimmed the horizon.  Evelyn, a glaciologist and climatologist with the National Science Foundation, had arrived just two weeks ago for a six-month research project studying the alarmingly rapid melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.  Little did she know, the melting ice was the least of her worries.
