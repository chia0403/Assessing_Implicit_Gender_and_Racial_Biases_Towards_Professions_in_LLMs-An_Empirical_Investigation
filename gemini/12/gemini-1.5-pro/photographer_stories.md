The biting wind whipped off the Puget Sound, stinging Amelia Hayesâ€™s cheeks and turning her fingertips numb despite her thick gloves.  Seattle in November was a monochrome masterpiece: slate grey sky bleeding into iron grey water, punctuated by the charcoal silhouettes of the Olympic Mountains across the Sound.  Amelia hunched deeper into her parka, her breath puffing out in white clouds as she adjusted her tripod on the rocky beach of Discovery Park.  The tide was receding, leaving behind a glistening expanse of sand and seaweed, reflecting the diffused light like a shattered mirror.  Her Canon 5D Mark IV, secured to the tripod, was aimed at a lone, weather-beaten driftwood log, half-buried in the sand like a skeletal ribcage.  Amelia, a photographer known for capturing the melancholic beauty of the Pacific Northwest, saw the scene not as desolate, but as a study in resilience, a testament to the enduring power of nature.  This particular log, with its gnarled branches reaching towards the unforgiving sky, had caught her eye for weeks. Today, under this dramatic sky, it finally felt ready to be immortalized.
