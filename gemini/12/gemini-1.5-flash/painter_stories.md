The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face as he wrestled the easel into position, its legs sinking slightly into the yielding sand.  The wind, a relentless sculptor of the Atlantic coastline, whipped his unruly dark hair across his eyes. He blinked it away, the vibrant turquoise of the churning ocean momentarily obscuring the already fading light.  Before him, the craggy cliffs of Cornwall rose like the teeth of some ancient beast, their granite faces etched with centuries of weathering, a symphony of ochre, umber, and deep violet that Elias knew he could never truly capture. The air, thick with the scent of brine and seaweed, carried the mournful cry of gulls overhead, a counterpoint to the rhythmic crash of waves against the rocks below.  He sighed, the chill biting through his worn oilskins.  Tonight, the canvas wouldn't just be a painting; it would be a battle against the elements, a desperate attempt to hold onto the fleeting beauty of the Cornish twilight.
