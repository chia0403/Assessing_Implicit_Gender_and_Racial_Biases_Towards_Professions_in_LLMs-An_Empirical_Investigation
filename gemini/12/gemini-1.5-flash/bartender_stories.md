The chipped Formica countertop felt cold beneath Elias Thorne’s fingertips as he meticulously polished a glass, the amber light of the setting sun catching the dust motes dancing in the air above the nearly empty bar.  Elias, a man whose life seemed perpetually marinated in the bittersweet tang of spilled whiskey and forgotten dreams, ran "The Rusty Mug," a dive bar clinging precariously to the edge of the crumbling docks in the forgotten corner of Seabrook.  The salty air, thick with the smell of brine and decaying timber, hung heavy, a constant reminder of the city's decaying heart. Tonight, however, the usual melancholic hum of the waterfront was punctuated by an unnerving silence, broken only by the rhythmic creak of the old ship moored just outside, its skeletal frame silhouetted against the bruised purple of the twilight sky.  Something felt…off. Even for Seabrook.
