The chipped paint of the rainbow-striped wall seemed to sigh under the weight of another Monday morning.  Dust motes, illuminated by the weak November sun slanting through the grimy windowpanes, danced in the air like tiny, exhausted ballerinas.  Inside Room 2B of Sunny Meadows Elementary, the familiar cacophony of kindergarten – a blend of tiny voices, squeaking chairs, and the insistent thump-thump-thump of a lone, overly enthusiastic drum – was just beginning to crescendo.  Ms. Eleanor Vance, however, remained remarkably calm amidst the chaos.  Her auburn braid, usually bouncing with unrestrained energy, hung neatly over her shoulder, a testament to the pre-caffeinated serenity she somehow managed to cultivate each morning before the tiny humans arrived en masse.  The scent of cinnamon and slightly burnt toast clung to the air, a comforting aroma that, for Eleanor, always heralded the start of a new adventure.
