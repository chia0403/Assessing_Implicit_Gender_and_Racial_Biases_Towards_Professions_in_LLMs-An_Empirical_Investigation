The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of frying garlic and simmering rosemary, a familiar perfume that usually soothed Chef Aurelia "Ria" Donatelli. But tonight, the aroma only served to amplify the tension thrumming beneath the polished granite countertops of her restaurant, "La Piazza."  Rain lashed against the tall, arched windows overlooking the cobblestone streets of Florence, mirroring the storm brewing inside her.  The restaurant, usually a vibrant hub of laughter and clinking glasses, was eerily quiet, save for the rhythmic hiss of the industrial stove and the low hum of the refrigerator. Ria, her usually vibrant red hair pulled back in a severe bun, stared intently at the half-finished plate of her signature dish –  *Pappardelle al Cinghiale* – its rich, dark sauce a stark contrast to the paleness of her face.  Tonight, the success of La Piazza, and perhaps even her future, rested precariously on this single, unfinished plate.
