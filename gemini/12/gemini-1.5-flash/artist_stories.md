The salt spray stung Seraphina "Sera" Moreau's face as she wrestled her easel into a more stable position against the howling wind.  The canvas, already splashed with the furious turquoise of the churning Atlantic, threatened to take flight along with the flock of gulls screeching overhead.  The cliffs of Pointe du Hoc, Normandy, rose behind her like jagged teeth, their scarred faces a testament to a history far older and far more violent than even the tempest raging around her.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and something faintly metallic – the lingering ghost of bloodshed, perhaps – whipped her hair across her paint-smeared cheeks.  Sera, however, didn't flinch.  She was used to the elements battling her art, almost expecting it.  It was in the struggle, in the wild, untamed beauty of the scene before her, that she found her truest inspiration.
