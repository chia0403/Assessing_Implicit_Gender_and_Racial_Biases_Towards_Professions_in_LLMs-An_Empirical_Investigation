The wind, a rasping sculptor itself, tore at Elias Thorne's weathered coat as he surveyed his quarry.  Dust, the fine, grey breath of the mountain, clung to everything – his beard, the roughspun fabric of his trousers, even the granite chips that littered the uneven ground around him.  Above, the peaks of the Dragon's Teeth range clawed at the bruised twilight sky, their jagged silhouettes painted in shades of purple and bruised orange. Elias, his hands gnarled and strong as the stone he worked, ran a calloused thumb across the face of a half-finished angel, its wings still buried within the raw mountain. The air, thin and biting at this altitude, carried the scent of pine and damp earth, a familiar perfume he’d known all his forty-seven years in the remote village of Oakhaven, nestled deep within the shadow of the Dragon's Teeth.  This was his life, a life carved from stone, as unforgiving and beautiful as the mountains themselves.
