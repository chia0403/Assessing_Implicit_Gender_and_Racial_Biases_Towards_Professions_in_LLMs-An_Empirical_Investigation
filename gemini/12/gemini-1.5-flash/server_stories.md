The chipped Formica tabletop felt slick under Amelia Hernandez's fingertips as she polished it for the tenth time that morning.  Sunlight, fractured by the grimy windowpanes of the "Rusty Mug Diner," cast long, distorted shadows across the linoleum floor.  The air hung thick with the smell of stale coffee, frying bacon, and the lingering scent of last night's spilled beer – a pungent perfume only a seasoned waitress like Amelia could tolerate.  Outside, the relentless Texas sun beat down on the cracked asphalt of Route 66, baking the already shimmering heat haze rising from the blacktop.  Amelia sighed, the weight of another long day settling on her shoulders, heavier than the overloaded tray she'd soon be carrying.  It was only 7:15 am, and already the pre-dawn quiet had been replaced by the low hum of anticipation – the hungry growl of the Rusty Mug's regular clientele.
