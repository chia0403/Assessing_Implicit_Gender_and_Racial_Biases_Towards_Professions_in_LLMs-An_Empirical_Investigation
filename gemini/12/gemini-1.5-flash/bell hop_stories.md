The brass spittoon gleamed under the dim, gaslit chandeliers of the Grand Majestic Hotel, reflecting the nervous sheen on Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's forehead.  Barty, a bellhop whose uniform was more rumpled than starched these days, adjusted the precarious stack of luggage balanced on his already overburdened trolley.  The air hung thick with the cloying scent of expensive perfume, stale cigars, and something faintly…metallic, a scent that usually preceded trouble in the Grand Majestic. Tonight, the metallic tang was particularly strong, a harbinger of a storm brewing far beyond the polished marble floors and velvet-roped corridors.  Outside, the Chicago wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the towering windows of the hotel, a fitting soundtrack to the anxieties churning in Barty’s stomach.  He was about to deliver a trunk to Room 313, and a knot of unease, as tight as a sailor's knot, tightened in his chest. Room 313.  It had a reputation.  A very bad reputation.
