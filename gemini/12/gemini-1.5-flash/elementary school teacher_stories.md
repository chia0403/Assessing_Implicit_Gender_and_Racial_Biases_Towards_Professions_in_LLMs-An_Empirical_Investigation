The chipped paint of the "Welcome to Mrs. Eleanor Vance's Third Grade!" sign flaked onto the dusty windowsill like a miniature, decaying snowdrift.  It mirrored the way Eleanor Vance herself felt that Monday morning â€“ worn, slightly brittle, and clinging stubbornly to the hope that this year would somehow be different.  The air in the Oakhaven Elementary School hallway hung thick and heavy with the scent of floor wax and impending chaos.  Children, a kaleidoscope of brightly coloured backpacks and slightly-too-big shoes, zipped past her, a tidal wave of untamed energy threatening to sweep her away before the bell even rang.  Eleanor straightened her sensible cardigan, its buttons a tiny, comforting army against the day's battle, and steeled herself.  Another year. Another thirty rambunctious eight-year-olds. Another attempt to nurture young minds and, perhaps, even save her own sanity in the process.
