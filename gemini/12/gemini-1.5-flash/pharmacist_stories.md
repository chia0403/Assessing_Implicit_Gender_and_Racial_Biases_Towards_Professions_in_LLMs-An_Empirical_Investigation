The chipped porcelain mortar, a relic from a bygone era, felt cool beneath Elara Vance’s fingertips. Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grimy window of Vance’s Apothecary, illuminating the swirling chaos of herbs, tinctures, and meticulously labelled jars lining the shelves.

Outside, the relentless rhythm of the city, Port Blossom, pulsed with a chaotic energy that was a stark contrast to the quiet, almost reverent, atmosphere within her shop.  The cobblestones were slick with a recent downpour, reflecting the gaslight glow in shimmering streaks.  Tonight, however, the usual vibrant hum of Port Blossom felt muted, a low thrum underlying a palpable sense of unease.  Elara, with her spectacles perched on her nose and a frown etched deep between her brows, was already anticipating a night far from ordinary.
