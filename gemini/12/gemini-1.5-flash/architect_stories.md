The biting November wind whipped Amelia Hernandez’s charcoal-grey coat around her legs as she stood perched precariously on the scaffolding, the skeletal remains of the Zenith Tower clawing at the bruised twilight sky.  Below, the city of Prague hummed with a low, resonant thrum – a symphony of trams screeching on cobblestones, distant church bells tolling the hour, and the muffled chatter of a thousand unseen lives.  Amelia, a principal architect at  K&L Design, squinted, the city lights blurring into a shimmering tapestry against the velvet backdrop of the approaching night.  The air, thick with the scent of woodsmoke and damp stone, carried the faint, almost imperceptible tang of something else – a metallic undercurrent that pricked at the edges of her senses, a discordant note in the otherwise harmonious city soundscape.  This wasn't just the usual Prague chill; this felt… different.  The Zenith Tower, her magnum opus, her architectural obsession, felt…wrong.
