The fluorescent lights of Mildred McMillan's tax preparation office hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the frantic tapping of her fingers on the keyboard.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and the faint, metallic tang of fear – a scent Mildred had come to recognize as the aroma of April 15th fast approaching.  Her office, a cramped space above a laundromat in the bustling, slightly rundown, commercial district of Oakhaven, Illinois, was a chaotic symphony of organized chaos.  Stacks of tax forms, meticulously color-coded and labeled, towered like precarious Jenga towers.  A half-eaten bagel sat forlornly on a desk littered with calculators, red pens, and crumpled receipts.  Outside, the March wind howled a mournful ballad against the grimy windowpanes, a stark contrast to the artificial warmth emanating from the ancient space heater sputtering in the corner.  Mildred, a woman whose sensible cardigan barely contained her simmering energy, squinted at the screen, her brow furrowed in concentration.  Another client’s return – another intricate puzzle to solve before the deadline.
