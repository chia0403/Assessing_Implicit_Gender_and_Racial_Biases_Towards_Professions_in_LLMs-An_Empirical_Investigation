The salt spray stung Dr. Elias Thorne's face as he wrestled the stretcher onto the pitching deck of the *Albatross*.  The fishing trawler, a battered vessel smelling strongly of cod and diesel, bucked and groaned beneath his feet, its wooden hull groaning a mournful counterpoint to the screams emanating from below.  The North Sea churned a furious grey beneath a sky the colour of bruised plums, the wind a howling banshee whipping at his already sodden coat.  Elias, his usually crisp white coat now plastered to his frame, gripped the stretcher's handles tighter.  This wasn't the sterile, brightly lit environment of the coastal hospital he was used to; this was a brutal, unforgiving fight for survival, hundreds of miles from land.  The casualty, a young deckhand named Finnigan, lay unconscious, his injuries still unknown, but clearly severe.  The air hung heavy with the metallic tang of blood and the chilling premonition of something far worse than a simple fishing accident.
