The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s auburn hair across her face as she hurried down the rain-slicked cobblestones of Charleston’s historic French Quarter.  The scent of jasmine, usually a comforting perfume clinging to the ancient brick buildings, was overpowered tonight by the sharp tang of salt spray and something else… something metallic, almost blood-like. Rain lashed against the wrought-iron balconies, obscuring the gaslight glow and casting the narrow street into a shadowy labyrinth.  Amelia, a registered nurse at Charleston Memorial Hospital for the past five years, tugged her worn wool coat tighter, the collar scratching against her neck.  She wasn't usually on call this late, but a frantic phone call from Dr. Ramirez had sent her scrambling, leaving behind the comforting warmth of her own fireside and a half-finished novel.  Tonight, the charm of the French Quarter felt less romantic and more menacing, a stage set for something unsettlingly wrong.
