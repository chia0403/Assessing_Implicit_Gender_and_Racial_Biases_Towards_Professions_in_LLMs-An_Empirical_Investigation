The biting wind howled a mournful tune through the skeletal branches of the ancient Douglas firs, whipping snow into a frenzy around Silas Blackwood's calloused hands.  Silas, a man carved from the same rugged granite as the mountains themselves, barely registered the chill.  He’d felt colder.  He'd felt worse. The biting wind was nothing compared to the gnawing emptiness in his gut, a hollowness that had settled there the day the mine collapsed, taking his brother, Jedediah, with it.  The scent of pine and damp earth, usually a comfort, only served to sharpen the memory, the lingering ghost of sawdust and coal dust clinging to the air like a shroud.  He stood on the precipice of Widow's Peak, the wind tugging at his thick wool coat, surveying his domain – a vast, snow-covered expanse of timber stretching towards the brooding peaks of the Cascade Range.  This was his life, his legacy, and the only place he felt remotely at peace, even now, beneath the unforgiving sky of the Washington wilderness.
