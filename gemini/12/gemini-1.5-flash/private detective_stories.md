The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Jack Stratton's office, a rhythm that mirrored the frantic drumming of his own anxiety.  Jack, not Jack Stratton, Private Investigator, but just plain Jack, felt the familiar pinch of indigestion tightening his chest.  His office, a cramped space above a failing bakery on Bleecker Street in the heart of Manhattan's increasingly gentrified West Village, smelled faintly of burnt sugar and desperation.  The sugar was courtesy of Sal's Sweet Surrender, the bakery below, perpetually teetering on the brink of bankruptcy; the desperation was entirely his own.  The flickering neon sign outside, proclaiming "Stratton Investigations â€“ We Find Answers," felt less a boast and more a desperate plea.  Tonight, the plea was particularly urgent.  A crumpled photograph lay on his desk, its edges softened by spilled coffee, showing a woman with eyes that held a storm of unshed tears, a woman whose disappearance had landed on Jack's already overburdened plate, threatening to bury him under a mountain of unpaid bills and unanswered questions.
