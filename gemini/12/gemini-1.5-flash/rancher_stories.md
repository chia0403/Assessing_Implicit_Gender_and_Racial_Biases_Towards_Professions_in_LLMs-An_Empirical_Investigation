The wind, a rasping baritone, howled across the plains, whipping dust devils into a frenzied dance across the parched earth.  Sun, a malevolent eye in the brassy sky, beat down on the cracked soil of the Barrenlands ranch, baking the already brittle grass to a crisp.

Whip, a man carved from the very landscape he commanded, stood on the porch, his silhouette stark against the setting sun, a silhouette that spoke of weathered resilience and a life lived hard against unforgiving odds.  The air hung heavy with the scent of dry earth and the faint, almost imperceptible tang of coming rain â€“ a promise as elusive as a mirage in this unforgiving land.
