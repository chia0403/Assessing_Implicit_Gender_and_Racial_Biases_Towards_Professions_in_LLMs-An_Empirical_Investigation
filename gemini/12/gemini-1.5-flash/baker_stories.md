The aroma of sourdough, sharp and yeasty, battled with the cloying sweetness of simmering apricot jam in the air above Amelia Grace Hawthorne's bakery.  Dust motes, illuminated by the weak morning sun struggling through the grimy windows of "The Flour Child," danced in the shafts of light like tiny, flour-dusted fairies.  Amelia, her hands stained a permanent ochre from years of kneading dough, hummed a jaunty tune off-key as she meticulously shaped a crown of challah, its golden strands gleaming under the harsh fluorescent lights overhead.  The bakery itself was a charming anachronism, a tiny, cluttered space nestled on a cobbled side street in the heart of Prague's Old Town, its walls adorned with chipped porcelain angels and faded photographs of past generations of bakers, each one looking just as weary and flour-dusted as Amelia felt at that particular pre-dawn hour.
