The fluorescent lights of the St. Jude's Medical Center phlebotomy lab hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Hernandez's otherwise silent morning.  The sterile scent of antiseptic mingled with the faint, metallic tang of blood – a familiar perfume that Amelia, after ten years on the job, barely registered anymore.  Rain lashed against the panoramic windows overlooking the city, blurring the already hazy cityscape into a watercolor of grey and black.  Inside, Amelia meticulously prepared her tray: tourniquets, needles of varying gauges, alcohol swabs, and cotton balls – the tools of her trade, laid out with the practiced precision of a surgeon.  Today, however, the usual calm before the storm of anxious patients felt… different.  A tremor of unease vibrated beneath the surface of her routine, a premonition that this Tuesday wouldn’t be just another day drawing blood.
