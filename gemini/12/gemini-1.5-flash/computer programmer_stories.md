The flickering neon sign of the "Cyberia Cafe" cast a lurid green glow across Elara Vance's rain-slicked trench coat.  Water dripped from the brim of her hat, mingling with the condensation clinging to her mug of lukewarm coffee.  Inside, the cafe hummed with a low thrum â€“ the collective murmur of keyboards, the click-clack of mice, and the faint whirring of servers housed somewhere in the depths of the building.  The air was thick with the scent of stale coffee, burnt sugar, and the ozone tang of overtaxed electronics.  Elara, a freelance programmer with a reputation for cracking codes that baffled the best in the business, hunched over her laptop, the glow of the screen illuminating the sharp angles of her face and the intensity in her dark eyes.  Tonight, however, the code wasn't the problem. The problem was the cryptic message she'd received, a single line of seemingly random characters, delivered through a channel so secure it felt like a ghost had whispered it into her ear.
