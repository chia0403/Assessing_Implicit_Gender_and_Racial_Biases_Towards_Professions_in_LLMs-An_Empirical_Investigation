The rasping cough that shook Elias Thorne’s frame was a familiar companion, as familiar as the scent of sun-baked earth and ripening barley that hung heavy in the air.  Dust, the color of dried blood, clung to his worn overalls, mirroring the crimson streaks painting the horizon where the setting sun bled into the bruised purple of the approaching twilight.  Elias, his face etched with the deep lines of a life spent wrestling with stubborn soil and unforgiving weather, leaned heavily on his hoe, the metal cool against his calloused hand.  His farm, nestled in the whispering valley of Oakhaven, was a tapestry of browns and golds at this time of year, a patchwork quilt stitched together by years of tireless labor – a labor that was beginning to feel its toll. The wind, a mournful sigh through the skeletal branches of ancient oak trees, carried the distant, mournful bleating of a lamb, lost perhaps, or simply lonely in the gathering gloom.  This wasn't just a farm; it was a legacy, a burden, and Elias Thorne, a man hardened by years of toil, was its sole protector.
