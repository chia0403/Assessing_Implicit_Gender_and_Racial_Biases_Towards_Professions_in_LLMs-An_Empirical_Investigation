The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Amy” Hernandez’s hair across her face as she surveyed the rain-slicked field.  Floodlights glared, reflecting off the puddles that mirrored the bruised purple sky above.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and the faint, metallic tang of blood – a lingering reminder of the brutal scrum that had just ended.  It wasn't the blood of her players, thankfully, but the remnants of a particularly vicious tackle during the otherwise lackluster practice session of the Redwood City Raptors, the high school rugby team she’d coached for the past five years.  Amy pulled her worn, heather grey fleece tighter around her, the damp chill seeping into her bones despite the layers.  The biting wind seemed to mock her efforts to instill discipline and skill into her relentlessly enthusiastic, yet often clumsy, team.  Tonight, however, the usual post-practice camaraderie felt strangely muted, a palpable tension hanging between the players like the low-hanging clouds.
