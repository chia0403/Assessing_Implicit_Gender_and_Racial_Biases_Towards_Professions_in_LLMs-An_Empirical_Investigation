The fluorescent lights of "Quick Stop Mart" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Hernandez's life for the past three years.  Amelia, a name whispered by the wind chimes hanging crookedly above the door – a constant, irritating reminder of her own quiet existence – stared blankly at the overflowing candy aisle reflected in the scratched Plexiglas of her register.  The air hung thick with the cloying sweetness of cheap bubblegum and the faint, lingering scent of stale coffee, a perfume only a seasoned Quick Stop employee could truly appreciate. Outside, the relentless Arizona sun beat down on the cracked asphalt parking lot, baking the already shimmering heat haze.  Inside, the air conditioning fought a losing battle against the relentless influx of hot, sweaty customers.  Another Tuesday. Another shift. Another endless stream of lottery tickets, lukewarm sodas, and complaints about the price of gas.
