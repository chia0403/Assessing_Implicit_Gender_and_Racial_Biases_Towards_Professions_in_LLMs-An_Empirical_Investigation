The chipped porcelain of Dr. Evelyn Reedâ€™s breakfast bowl reflected the pre-dawn grey seeping through the blinds. Rain lashed against the windows of her small, book-lined apartment overlooking the perpetually damp cobblestone streets of Edinburgh.  The city, usually a vibrant tapestry of history and hurried footsteps, was muffled this morning, hushed under a blanket of relentless November drizzle.  Evelyn, however, was anything but hushed.  She was wrestling with a particularly stubborn bran muffin, her brow furrowed in concentration as she meticulously measured the crumbly remains into a small, calibrated scale.  The faint scent of Earl Grey tea and the lingering sweetness of cinnamon battled with the damp chill that clung to the air, a fitting metaphor for the internal conflict raging within her.  This wasn't just breakfast; it was a meticulously planned experiment, the latest in a series of attempts to perfect a high-fiber, low-glycemic index recipe for her notoriously stubborn patient, Lord Alistair Blackwood.  The stakes, as always, were higher than just a good bowel movement.
