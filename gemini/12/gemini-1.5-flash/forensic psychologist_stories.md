The biting November wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vance's auburn hair across her face as she surveyed the scene.  Rain, a relentless, icy drizzle, plastered her trench coat to her slender frame, mirroring the grim dampness clinging to the air around the abandoned textile mill.  Rust-eaten machinery, skeletal remains of looms and spinning jennies, clawed at the gloom of the cavernous space.  The air hung thick with the smell of decay – a potent cocktail of mildew, damp earth, and something else, something faintly metallic that pricked at the edges of her senses, hinting at the violence that had transpired within these crumbling walls.  A single police car, its headlights cutting pathetic swaths through the pervasive darkness, sat forlornly in the muddy yard, its blue and red lights reflecting in the greasy puddles that mirrored the desolate sky.  This wasn't her first gruesome scene, far from it, but something about the oppressive silence of the mill, broken only by the mournful sigh of the wind, felt… different.  Different and deeply unsettling.
