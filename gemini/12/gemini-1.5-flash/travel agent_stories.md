The scent of old paper and exotic spices hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume only Amelia “Mia” Hawthorne truly appreciated.  Rain lashed against the leaded windows of "Wanderlust Voyages," her travel agency, blurring the already-dim gaslight reflections on the cobblestones of Bleecker Street.  Water trickled down the windowpanes, mimicking the steady stream of anxieties that seemed to pour from the clients who frequented her shop – anxieties she, Mia, was uniquely positioned to alleviate, or at least temporarily soothe, with the promise of faraway lands and sun-drenched beaches.  The worn, mahogany desk, littered with brochures featuring iridescent coral reefs and snow-capped Himalayan peaks, groaned under the weight of her overflowing in-tray; a testament to the unpredictable and often chaotic nature of her profession.  Tonight, however, felt different.  The usual hum of nervous energy was replaced by a palpable stillness, broken only by the rhythmic drumming of the rain and the occasional creak of the ancient floorboards.  Something was brewing, something beyond the usual last-minute flight changes and lost luggage claims.
