The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume unique to Seraphina “Sera”  Bellweather’s salon, "Shear Genius."  Dust motes, illuminated by the afternoon sun slanting through the large bay window, danced in the stillness between the plush velvet armchairs.  Sera, her fingers stained a vibrant fuchsia from a particularly stubborn client's crimson dye job, meticulously swept stray hairs from the pristine white countertop.  Outside, the relentless rhythm of the city – the blare of car horns, the distant wail of a siren – was muted by the thick, soundproofed walls of her little haven.  It was a haven, however, that felt less peaceful than usual.  A tension, almost palpable, hung in the air, thicker even than the cloying sweetness of the hairspray. Tonight was the annual “Hairitage Awards,” and Sera, nominated for “Best Avant-Garde Style,” felt a knot of anxiety tightening in her stomach, far more tangled than any intricate braid she’d ever crafted.
