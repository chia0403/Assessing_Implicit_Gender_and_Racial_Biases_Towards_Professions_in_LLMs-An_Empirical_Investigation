The biting November wind whipped Professor Eleanor Vance’s auburn hair across her face as she hurried across the quad, the ancient stones of Blackwood University slick underfoot with a film of melting snow.  Gothic spires clawed at the bruised twilight sky, their shadows stretching long and skeletal across the manicured lawns.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and woodsmoke from distant chimneys, held a chill that seeped deep into her bones, a chill that mirrored the unease gnawing at her stomach.  Tonight, the usual comforting hum of academic life at Blackwood was replaced by a palpable sense of dread, a silence broken only by the mournful creak of ancient oak branches and the distant, rhythmic tolling of the university bell – a sound that, tonight, felt less like a call to prayer and more like a somber death knell.
