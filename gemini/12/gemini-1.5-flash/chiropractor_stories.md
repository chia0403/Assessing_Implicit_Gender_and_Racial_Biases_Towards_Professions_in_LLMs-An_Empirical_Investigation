The salt spray stung Dr. Eleanor Vance’s face as she wrestled the stubborn fishing net onto the weathered wooden pier.  The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum against the churning grey-green Atlantic, cast long shadows across the rickety planks.  Seagulls shrieked overhead, their cries a counterpoint to the rhythmic crash of waves against the rocky shoreline of Port Blossom, Maine.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and decaying seaweed, held a chill that seeped into her bones, a far cry from the sterile, temperature-controlled comfort of her chiropractic clinic just a short walk away.  Eleanor, however, found solace in the raw, untamed beauty of the coast, a welcome balm to the often aching bodies – both physical and emotional – that filled her waiting room each day.  This evening, though, her focus was entirely on the day's catch, hoping for enough mackerel to fill the freezer and provide a welcome change from the endless stream of kale smoothies she’d been forcing down in an attempt to manage her own persistent back pain.
