The biting wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vance’s auburn braid across her face as she wrestled the heavy oak door of the Alder Creek Animal Clinic open.  Snow, the kind that clung like powdered sugar to everything it touched, piled high against the weathered clapboard siding, practically burying the small, single-story building beneath a pristine, unforgiving blanket.  Inside, the air hung thick with the comforting, slightly antiseptic smell of disinfectant and damp wool – a familiar balm to Eleanor's weary soul after a day spent battling the elements and the stubborn cough of a particularly recalcitrant Border Collie. The only sound was the rhythmic tick-tock of an antique grandfather clock in the reception area, its pendulum swinging with the measured pace of a heartbeat, a stark contrast to the chaotic rhythm of life she usually encountered.  The dying embers in the wood stove cast long shadows across the worn Persian rug, painting the waiting room in shades of amber and deep orange.  Tonight, however, the waiting room remained empty, a silent testament to the quiet solitude of the remote Alaskan village she called home.
