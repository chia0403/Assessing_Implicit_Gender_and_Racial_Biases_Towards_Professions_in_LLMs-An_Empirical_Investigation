Outside, the Chicago wind howled a mournful song against the towering steel and glass of the city's skyline, a stark contrast to the meticulously ordered world contained within the four walls of the drafting room.  Tonight, however, the usual rhythm of her work was disrupted. A new project, a sprawling, ambitious skyscraper, lay before her, its complexities a daunting challenge even for someone with Amelia's years of experience.
