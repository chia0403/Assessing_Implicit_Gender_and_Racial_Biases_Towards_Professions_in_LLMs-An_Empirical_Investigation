The midday sun beat down on Amelia Hernandez's neck, turning the already-sticky humidity of the Louisiana bayou into a suffocating blanket.  Cicadas buzzed their relentless symphony from the Spanish moss-draped cypress trees, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *chug-chug-chug* of Amelia's small, swamp-green tour boat.  The air hung heavy with the scent of decaying vegetation and something else… something subtly sweet and faintly unsettling.  Amelia, a woman whose sun-weathered face betrayed years spent navigating these murky waters, adjusted the brim of her wide-brimmed straw hat and checked the faded map clutched in her hand.  Today's tour group – a slightly anxious-looking family from Ohio – sat expectantly in the boat's stern, their eyes wide with a mixture of anticipation and trepidation as they gazed into the emerald depths of Bayou Terrebonne.  Amelia smiled, a practiced, reassuring gesture.  "Welcome, everyone," she announced, her voice carrying easily over the water, "to the heart of the bayou.  Let's begin our journey."
