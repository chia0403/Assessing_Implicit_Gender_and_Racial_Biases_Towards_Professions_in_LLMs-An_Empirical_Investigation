The diesel engine coughed, a throaty rumble that vibrated through Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins's bones, a familiar tremor he’d felt for twenty years.  He gripped the worn leather of the steering wheel, his knuckles bone-white against the sun-bleached surface.  The cab of his eighteen-wheeler, a battered but trusty Kenworth named Betsy, was bathed in the bruised purple light of a desert sunset.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of ochre and red, danced across the cracked asphalt of Route 66, their swirling forms mirroring the chaotic thoughts churning in Bart’s mind.  Ahead, the sky bled into a fiery orange, mirroring the bruised landscape stretching before him – the endless, unforgiving expanse of the Mojave Desert, a place where the only company was the whispering wind and the ever-present threat of the sun’s relentless glare.  His last delivery had been… unusual.  And he had a feeling this next one would be even more so.
