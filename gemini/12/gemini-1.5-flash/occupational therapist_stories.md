The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Mia” Holloway’s auburn hair across her face as she hurried down the cobbled street, the collar of her worn wool coat pulled high.  Rain, sleeting now, plastered her already damp fringe to her forehead.  She tugged her worn leather satchel tighter against her hip, its contents – a kaleidoscope of brightly coloured therapy putty, textured balls, and a well-loved copy of “The Sensory Integration Handbook” – jostling against each other.  The air hung thick with the smells of woodsmoke and damp earth, a familiar, comforting aroma in the quaint, if slightly dilapidated, seaside town of Port Blossom.  Mia, a registered occupational therapist with a passion for helping children overcome developmental challenges, was late, again.  The old Victorian house looming ahead, its paint peeling like sunburnt skin, was her destination – the home of her newest patient, seven-year-old Finnigan O’Malley, and the epicentre of a puzzle that was already proving more complex than any sensory integration disorder she'd encountered before.
