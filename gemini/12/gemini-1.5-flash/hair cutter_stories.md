The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume only Aurelia “Relly” Blackwood truly appreciated.  Her salon, "Shear Perfection," wasn't your typical upscale establishment.  Tucked away on a cobbled side street in the ancient port town of Oakhaven, it was a haven of mismatched furniture – a velvet chaise lounge beside a chipped wooden stool, a vintage barber’s chair gleaming incongruously amidst the bohemian clutter.  Sunlight, filtered through the dusty windowpanes, illuminated motes of dust dancing in the air, catching the glint of Relly’s scissors, poised mid-air like expectant birds.  Outside, the rhythmic crash of waves against the harbour wall provided a constant, comforting soundtrack to her workday.  But today, the usual calm was shattered.  A frantic knock echoed through the small salon, followed by a voice, high-pitched and laced with desperation, calling out her name.
