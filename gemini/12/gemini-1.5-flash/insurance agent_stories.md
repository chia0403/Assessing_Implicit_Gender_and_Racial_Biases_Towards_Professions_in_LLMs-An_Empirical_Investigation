The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia "Mia" Hernandez's hands, a meager comfort against the November chill seeping through the drafty window of her office.  Rain lashed against the panes, mirroring the turmoil brewing inside her.  Her small, independent insurance agency, Hernandez & Associates, perched precariously on the third floor of a crumbling Victorian building in the heart of San Francisco's Mission District, smelled faintly of old paper, burnt coffee, and the lingering scent of last week's spilled chai latte – a testament to the long hours and even longer list of clients she juggled.  Outside, the vibrant colours of the murals that splashed across the neighbouring buildings were muted by the relentless downpour, a fitting backdrop to the grey anxiety that clung to Mia like the damp fog that often rolled in from the bay.  The only bright spot in the room was a single, defiant sunflower, its head drooping slightly but stubbornly refusing to yield to the gloom.  It was a gift from her grandmother, a reminder to always find the light, even in the darkest of storms – a sentiment Mia desperately needed today.
