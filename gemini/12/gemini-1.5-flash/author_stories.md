The salt spray stung Amelia Grace Hawthorne's face as she wrestled the stubborn canvas awning of her seaside cottage into submission.  October’s wind, a howling banshee fresh from the Atlantic, threatened to tear the thing from its moorings entirely.  Amelia, however, was tenacious, a quality honed not just by years spent battling the elements on the windswept cliffs of Cornwall, but also by a lifetime spent battling writer's block – a far more formidable opponent, in her opinion.  Her cottage, perched precariously on the edge of a crumbling cliff overlooking the churning grey sea, mirrored her current state of mind: battered, beautiful, and clinging stubbornly to life.  The scent of brine and decaying seaweed mingled with the faint, almost imperceptible aroma of woodsmoke from a distant village, a melancholic perfume that perfectly captured the mood of her unfinished novel.
