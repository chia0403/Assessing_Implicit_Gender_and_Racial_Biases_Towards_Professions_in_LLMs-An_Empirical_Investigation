The chill wind, thick with the scent of woodsmoke and brine, whipped around Archibald "Archie" Finch's ankles as he hauled a side of beef into his shop, "Finch's Finest."  The air hung heavy with the metallic tang of blood, a familiar perfume that clung to the rough-hewn wooden walls and the worn flagstones beneath his feet.  Finch's Finest, nestled on the edge of the windswept coastal town of Port Blossom, was more than just a butcher shop; it was an institution, a place where generations had come for their Sunday roasts and the comforting clink of Archie's cleaver.  The gas lamps flickered weakly against the encroaching gloom of a November evening, casting long, dancing shadows that played tricks on the rows of cured meats hanging from the rafters.  The only other sound besides the wind was the rhythmic *thwack-thwack-thwack* of Archieâ€™s cleaver, a steady counterpoint to the rhythmic crash of waves against the nearby cliffs.
