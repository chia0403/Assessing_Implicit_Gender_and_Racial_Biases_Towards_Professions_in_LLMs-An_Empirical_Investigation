The scent of lavender and old silk hung heavy in the air, a comforting perfume that clung to the velvet curtains and the chipped porcelain figurines lining the shelves of Amelia Featherstonehaugh's atelier.  Dust motes, illuminated by the afternoon sun slanting through the tall, arched windows, danced in the shafts of light that fell across bolts of shimmering brocade, crisp linen, and richly textured damask.  Outside, the cobbled streets of  Little Venice hummed with the muted sounds of a bustling London afternoon – the clip-clop of horses' hooves, the distant rumble of a carriage, and the murmur of voices – a world Amelia, lost in the meticulous task of hand-stitching a delicate rose onto a pale blue silk gown, barely registered.  Her needle, a tiny silver dart, moved with practiced grace, guided by fingers that knew the language of fabric as intimately as she knew her own name.
