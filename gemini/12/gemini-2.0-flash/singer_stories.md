## Story Opening:

The smoky haze clung to the air in The Velvet Curtain, a dive bar so perpetually dark it felt like midnight at noon. Alistair Finch, his full name a mouthful even he rarely used, stood hunched over the battered piano, its ivory keys yellowed with age and countless spilled drinks. He ran a hand through his perpetually disheveled, auburn hair, the gesture doing little to tame the stray strands that fell across his brow. Tonight, the air felt particularly thick, laced with the usual stale beer and cheap perfume, but also something else â€“ a nervous anticipation that prickled at his skin.

He took a slow, deliberate drag from his cigarette, the cherry glowing a defiant red in the gloom. Around him, the usual suspects occupied their usual corners: grizzled veterans nursing their whiskies, lonely souls clinging to the hope of fleeting connection, and the occasional tourist brave enough to venture off the well-trodden path. They were his audience, his confidantes, and his escape, all rolled into one boozy, bittersweet package. Tonight, however, they were more restless than usual, their murmurs a low hum beneath the incessant clatter of ice in glasses.

Alistair glanced up at the clock above the bar, its hands frozen permanently at 3:17 AM. Time had always been a fluid concept in The Velvet Curtain, a place where yesterdays bled into tomorrows, and regrets lingered longer than the smell of last call. Tonight, however, time mattered. Tonight, someone important was coming. Tonight, Alistair Finch was singing for his life.

## Setting:

**The Velvet Curtain:** A dimly lit, run-down bar located in the historic (and somewhat seedy) district of **New Orleans, Louisiana**, near the French Quarter.

**Details:**

*   **Interior:** Characterized by red velvet drapes (hence the name), peeling wallpaper, mismatched furniture, and a general air of faded grandeur.
*   **Atmosphere:** A haven for artists, musicians, and outcasts. The air is thick with cigarette smoke, the scent of cheap liquor, and the ghosts of countless stories.
*   **Notable Features:** A battered, out-of-tune piano, a small, raised stage barely big enough for a single performer, and a perpetually sticky bar top.
*   **Location Importance:** The New Orleans setting provides a backdrop of rich musical history, vibrant culture, and an undercurrent of mystery and darkness, all of which contribute to Alistair's character and the overall mood of the story. The bar is his sanctuary, but also a constant reminder of the faded dreams and broken promises that permeate the city.
