## Story Opening:

The first hint something was wrong wasn't the smell of smoke. That was Tuesday for Firefighter Emily Carter. No, it was the unsettling silence. Usually, at this hour, Engine 12's bays were a symphony of clanking metal, roaring engines being prepped, and the cheerful (if somewhat raucous) banter of her crew. Now, the air hung thick and still, broken only by the faint hum of the fluorescent lights overhead. A chill snaked down Emily's spine, prickling the hairs on the back of her neck. She double-checked her watch: 06:45. They were usually in full swing by now. Where was everyone?
## Setting:

The story begins at **Fire Station 12 in the Oakhaven district of Southbridge City**. The station itself is a red-brick building, built in the 1950s, showing its age in the chipped paint and faded station crest above the main entrance. Inside, the main bay is a large, cavernous space designed to house three fire engines. The walls are lined with lockers and shelves overflowing with equipment â€“ hoses, nozzles, axes, and spare helmets. To the side, a staircase leads to the living quarters, a common room with mismatched furniture, a well-worn television, and a kitchen perpetually smelling of burnt coffee and half-eaten leftovers. The overall atmosphere is one of well-worn practicality, reflecting the demanding and often dangerous work that takes place within its walls. The Oakhaven district surrounding the station is a mix of residential homes, small businesses, and the sprawling industrial park that provides a significant source of callouts.
