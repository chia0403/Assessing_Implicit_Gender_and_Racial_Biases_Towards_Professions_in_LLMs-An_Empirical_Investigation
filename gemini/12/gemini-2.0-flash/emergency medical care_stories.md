## Story Opening & Setting:

**Opening:**

The screech of tires tearing into asphalt was a song Amelia "Amy" Marie Rodriguez knew all too well. It was the prelude to chaos, the overture to tragedy, and tonight, it was playing just for her. She slammed the Suburban into park, gravel spitting out from under the tires, the flashing lights of her mobile medical unit painting the scene in stark reds and blues. The air hung thick and humid, heavy with the metallic tang of blood and the acrid burn of burnt rubber. Amy didn't hesitate. She was out of the truck and running before the engine had even died, her medical bag banging against her hip, adrenaline already pumping through her veins.

**Setting:**

The scene was a rural intersection just outside of the small, struggling town of Harmony Creek, Tennessee. It was a Friday night, late, around 11:30 PM. The neon sign of the dilapidated "Harmony Creek Diner" flickered in the background, casting long, dancing shadows across the twisted wreckage of a pickup truck and a small sedan. Cornfields, tall and whispering in the night breeze, stretched out on either side of the intersection, silent witnesses to the carnage. The nearest hospital was a good forty minutes away, making Amy Rodriguez and her mobile unit the only hope for anyone still trapped inside the twisted metal. The air was alive with the whirring of sirens, the distant bark of dogs, and the terrified whimpers that Amy knew instinctively came from someone in desperate need of her help. The country quiet of Harmony Creek had been shattered, replaced with the urgent cacophony of a nightmare.
