## Story Opening & Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The scent of buttercream and burnt sugar was thick enough to cut with a palette knife, clinging to Amelia Rose Carter's floral apron like a second skin. She sighed, her breath puffing out a cloud in the chilly pre-dawn air seeping in from the cracks around the bakeryâ€™s old window frames. Five more tiers. Five more miniature sugar roses. Five more opportunities to either achieve cake-decorating immortality or collapse in a heap of exhausted, frosting-smeared despair. Amelia glanced at the clock, its hands mocking her with their slow, deliberate crawl. 3:47 AM. And the bride would be here to pick it up at 9:00 AM sharp.

**Setting:**

"Sweet Surrender" bakery, nestled on a quiet side street in the quirky, artsy town of Bellflower Creek, Oregon. The bakery is a charming, if slightly dilapidated, building with peeling paint the colour of faded lavender and a sign that perpetually swings just a little bit too much. Inside, it's a chaotic ballet of flour dust, scattered sprinkles, and the rhythmic whir of stand mixers. The walls are lined with mismatched shelves overflowing with cake pans, piping bags, and jars of brightly coloured edible glitter. A large, stainless steel counter dominates the front of the shop, showcasing a rotating display of Amelia's creations - everything from whimsical cupcakes to elaborate, multi-tiered wedding cakes. The back, where Amelia spends the majority of her time, is a slightly less-charming extension of the chaos, cluttered with bowls, spatulas, and half-finished masterpieces. The air is always thick with the sweet scent of baking, a comforting aroma that both inspires and threatens to overwhelm.
