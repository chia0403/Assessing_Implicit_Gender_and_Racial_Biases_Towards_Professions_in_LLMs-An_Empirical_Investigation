## Story Opening:

The humid Florida air clung to Dr. Amelia Grace Rodriguez like a damp shroud as she wrestled with the stubbornly jammed lock on her clinic’s door. Sunrise, a riot of pink and orange bleeding across the horizon, offered little solace against the gnawing dread in her stomach. She wasn't usually this early, but a frantic call from Mrs. Peterson, her most vulnerable and emotionally dependent patient, had pulled her from a fitful sleep at 5 AM.

“Said something about not being able to feel her legs anymore,” Amelia muttered, yanking harder on the doorknob. The lock finally yielded with a protesting click. Stepping inside, the familiar scent of antiseptic and therapeutic putty barely registered. All Amelia could think about was Mrs. Peterson, trapped in her pastel-decorated condo a few blocks away, her fragile spirit threatening to shatter like a dropped teacup. Amelia just hoped she could piece it back together again, like she always did.
## Setting:

**The Physical Therapy Clinic:**

Amelia works at "Restore & Renew Physical Therapy," a small, independent clinic in a bustling suburb of Orlando, Florida. The clinic itself is located in a nondescript strip mall, sandwiched between a nail salon and a perpetually empty storefront that has, at various times, been a vape shop, a tax preparation service, and a short-lived artisanal pickle stand.

Inside, the clinic is bright and airy, a deliberate contrast to the drab exterior. Sunlight streams through the large windows, bouncing off the polished floors and cheerful, turquoise-painted walls. One side is dedicated to assessment and treatment rooms, each meticulously clean and equipped with various machines: ultrasound units, electrical stimulation devices, and adjustable treatment tables. The other side is a spacious gym area filled with exercise bikes, treadmills, resistance bands, and a disconcertingly large collection of multicolored therapy balls. Potted plants, struggling valiantly against the air conditioning, dot the corners, adding a touch of forced cheer to the clinical environment. The air is thick with the scent of antiseptic cleaner and the subtle, almost medicinal, aroma of therapeutic putty, a constant reminder of the daily battles fought and won (or lost) against pain and physical limitations.
