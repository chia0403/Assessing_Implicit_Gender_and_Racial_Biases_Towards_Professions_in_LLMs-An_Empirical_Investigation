## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights of the Quick Stop hummed a monotonous tune that mirrored Mildred Agatha Pennyfeather's internal soundtrack: a low, buzzing discontent punctuated by the occasional ping of the register. Mildred, perpetually perched on her stool behind the chipped Formica counter, watched the rain lash against the steamed-up windows. It was a Tuesday, the bleakest day of the week, and even the promise of half-price microwave burritos couldn't lure in more than the usual assortment of down-on-their-luck souls and teenagers looking for trouble.

Mildred sighed, rearranging the candy bars for the tenth time that hour. The Snickers needed to be at the front, she reasoned, their caramel-peanut glory a beacon of sugary hope in the gray drizzle. It wasn't much of a purpose, organising chocolate, but it was *her* purpose, at least for the next six hours. She glanced at the clock. Only three down, three to go. Tonight, she promised herself, tonight she would finally start that online pottery class. Maybe learning to mold something beautiful from clay would be the antidote to the soul-crushing monotony of scanning lottery tickets and dispensing stale coffee.

## Setting:

The Quick Stop was a relic, a greasy spoon convenience store stubbornly clinging to life in a rapidly gentrifying neighborhood. Located on the corner of Bleecker and Carmine, it was a small, boxy building squeezed between a trendy vegan bakery and a boutique selling ethically sourced artisan soaps. The paint, once a vibrant yellow, was now peeling and faded, revealing patches of drab gray underneath. Inside, the air hung heavy with the combined scents of old coffee, stale cigarettes, and something indefinably chemical emanating from the back of the store, where Tony, the owner, brewed his infamous "mystery meat" chili.

The shelves were crammed with a hodgepodge of items: dusty cans of soup, dented boxes of cereal, and a perpetually rotating selection of questionable snacks that seemed to have been abandoned by other, more discerning convenience stores. A single, flickering fluorescent bulb buzzed overhead, casting a harsh, unflattering light on the worn linoleum floor and the faded promotional posters plastered on the walls. The only splash of color came from the lottery tickets hanging by the register and the precarious tower of brightly coloured sodas stacked near the entrance. Outside, the relentless New York City rain continued to fall, washing the grime from the sidewalks and reflecting the neon glow of the city in shimmering puddles.
