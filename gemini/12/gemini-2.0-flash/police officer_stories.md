## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The relentless, humid air hung heavy over Miami, Florida, clinging to everything like a second skin. The pre-dawn sky was a bruised purple, barely hinting at the fiery sunrise to come. Palm trees rustled in the lukewarm breeze, a soundtrack to the urban symphony of distant sirens and the rumble of delivery trucks already crisscrossing the city. The location was a strip mall on NW 7th Street, its once-vibrant pastel paint chipped and faded under the harsh Florida sun. A lone, flickering fluorescent light buzzed over the entrance to a boarded-up laundromat, casting long, distorted shadows that danced with the nervous twitch of stray cats.

**Story Opening:**

The aroma of Cuban coffee, strong and bitter, did little to cut through the grit clinging to Detective Isabella “Izzy” Rodriguez’s tongue. She leaned against the hood of her unmarked Ford Taurus, the worn leather of her holster digging into her hip. Steam rose from the styrofoam cup in her hand, a pathetic attempt to ward off the creeping chill of the early morning air. This wasn’t her jurisdiction, but a favor was a favor, especially when it came from Captain Esposito. Besides, a body was a body, no matter the zip code. The yellow crime scene tape, strung haphazardly around the laundromat, flapped in the breeze like a macabre banner. Izzy took another sip of the coffee, her gaze sweeping across the scene. Something felt off. It wasn't just the inherent ugliness of death, or the pathetic desperation etched onto the victim’s face, visible even under the harsh glare of the police floodlights. It was something deeper, a subtle discordance that set her teeth on edge. She crumpled the empty coffee cup in her hand, the plastic groaning under the pressure. This wasn't going to be a clean one. This was going to be messy. And messy in Miami, Izzy knew, usually meant a whole lot of trouble.
