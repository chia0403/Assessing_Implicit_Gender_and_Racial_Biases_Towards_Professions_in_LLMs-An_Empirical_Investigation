## Opening:

The chipped ceramic mug warmed Agatha Beatrice Finch's hands, a small comfort against the pre-dawn chill that clung to everything in Port Blossom, even in late July. Steam curled upwards, a phantom of the potent Earl Grey tea she'd brewed, and momentarily obscured the fog-drenched view from her salon window. Fog that looked less like a romantic shroud and more like a damp, grey judgement looming over the little coastal town.

Agatha sighed, a sound that rustled through the faded, floral wallpaper of "Agatha's Clipping Corner," a sound as familiar as the snip-snip-snip of her shears. Today was shaping up to be one of *those* days. She could feel it in her bones, a dull ache that echoed the persistent thrum of the foghorn out on the bay. The kind of day where Mrs. Higgins would complain about the "atrocity" of her last perm, where young Timmy Sullivan would inevitably wiggle so much during his buzzcut that he'd end up looking like a lop-eared bunny rabbit, and where, most frustratingly, the fog would seep into the salon, making the mirrors look perpetually cloudy and blurring the perfect lines she strived for.

She took a long sip of tea, bracing herself. Port Blossom and its residents, with their salt-sprayed hair and wind-chapped faces, needed her. And Agatha Beatrice Finch, despite the fog and the pre-dawn gloom, wouldn't let them down.
## Setting:

**Agatha's Clipping Corner** sits perched on the edge of Mariner's Wharf in Port Blossom, a quaint but often windswept town nestled on the rugged coast of Maine. The building itself is a former fisherman's cottage, painted a cheerful, if slightly peeling, robin's egg blue. Inside, the space is cramped but cozy.

*   **Interior:** A single haircutting chair, upholstered in worn vinyl, dominates the center of the room. Around it, a carefully curated collection of vintage mirrors reflects the light (when there is any) and makes the small space appear larger. One wall is lined with shelves overflowing with every hair product imaginable, from Grandma Finch's homemade rosemary hair tonic to the latest salon-grade shampoos. The air is thick with the scent of hairspray, lavender, and a hint of the salty sea air that perpetually seeps in through the ill-fitting windows.

*   **Details:** Newspaper clippings featuring Agatha's award-winning trims (back in her younger, more competitive days) are proudly displayed alongside faded photographs of Port Blossom from a bygone era. A chipped porcelain cat sits sentinel on the windowsill, overlooking the bustling wharf. The floorboards creak with every step, a testament to the building's age and the countless footsteps that have crossed its threshold.

*   **Exterior:** The exterior features a small, hand-painted sign swinging gently in the breeze, proclaiming "Agatha's Clipping Corner - Fine Haircuts & Friendly Chatter Since 1952." Flower boxes overflowing with vibrant petunias and geraniums add a splash of color against the weathered blue paint. The constant sound of seagulls squawking and fishing boats chugging in and out of the harbor provides a constant backdrop to life at Agatha's.
