The tar sizzled under Arthur Percival Finch's worn leather boots, the smell thick and acrid in the midday heat. He wiped a bead of sweat from his brow with the back of his calloused hand, leaving a streak of grey grime across his already sun-baked skin. Arthur, a man built like a brick chimney himself, surveyed the roof of the old Victorian on Willow Creek Drive. It was a monstrosity of angles and gables, a patchwork quilt of mismatched shingles and crumbling mortar that would make a lesser roofer weep.

The town of Havenwood, nestled deep in the Appalachian foothills, was a place where time seemed to move a little slower, and where the houses, like the people, carried the weight of generations. This particular house, belonging to the recently deceased Mrs. Eleanor Ainsworth, was one of the oldest, a rambling three-story testament to a bygone era of prosperity and, Arthur suspected, a fair share of whispered secrets. The overgrown wisteria climbed the porch columns like grasping claws, and the paint peeled from the clapboard siding in long, ghostly strips. It was a house that seemed to breathe with a life of its own, a life Arthur was about to disrupt, one shingle at a time.
