## Story Opening and Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The rhythmic scrape of graphite against vellum was the soundtrack to Arthur Penhaligon’s life. He pressed a little harder, emphasizing the precise curve of the load-bearing arch. Damn Mr. Abernathy and his insistence on these flamboyant, neo-Gothic flourishes. Arthur, personally, preferred the clean, unadorned lines of the Bauhaus movement, but a man had to earn a crust, and Mr. Abernathy, with his booming laugh and even louder ties, was paying him handsomely. As the late afternoon sun streamed through the grimy window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air, Arthur felt a familiar prickle of frustration. Was this all there was? Meticulously rendering someone else’s vision, brick by brick, arch by arch, until the ink stained his fingers and his back ached with protest?

He sighed, pushing his spectacles further up his nose. Just then, a sharp rap on the door jolted him from his reverie.

**Setting:**

The story is set in a dimly lit, cramped office in **Glasgow, Scotland, in 1938.** The office, belonging to the architectural firm of Abernathy & Sons, is located above a bustling bakery, the aroma of freshly baked bread constantly permeating the air, albeit tinged with the less appealing smells of industrial grit and coal smoke from the city streets. Arthur Penhaligon's personal workspace consists of a large, cluttered drafting table, covered in blueprints, rulers, compasses, and various grades of pencils. A single, bare bulb hangs overhead, providing inadequate lighting that casts long, dancing shadows across the room. Shelves overflowing with architectural books, old journals, and half-finished projects line one wall, while another is adorned with faded photographs of completed buildings and sketches by previous employees. The atmosphere is one of quiet industry, punctuated by the occasional rumble of trams passing by on the street below and the persistent scratching of drafting tools. The air itself feels thick with the weight of history and the promise of a city on the cusp of change.
