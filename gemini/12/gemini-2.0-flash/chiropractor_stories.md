## Story Opening and Setting

**Opening:**

The smell of eucalyptus and rubbing alcohol hung heavy in the air, a familiar balm to Dr. Eleanor Rose McKinley’s frazzled nerves. It was the kind of Tuesday that felt like a Monday after a three-day weekend filled with toddler tantrums and questionable barbecue. Outside, the Seattle rain hammered against the windowpanes of McKinley Chiropractic, mirroring the relentless pressure she felt building behind her own eyes. She scrubbed her hands raw at the sink, the hot water doing little to soothe the phantom ache radiating from her own lower back. This was the last appointment of the day, and frankly, she needed it as much as, if not more than, her patient. A sigh escaped her lips. "Showtime," she murmured to her reflection, a pale face framed by dark, perpetually messy curls.

**Setting:**

McKinley Chiropractic was nestled in the heart of Ballard, a charming Seattle neighborhood known for its Scandinavian heritage and trendy breweries. The office itself occupied the ground floor of a converted brick building, its large windows offering a view of the bustling Market Street. Inside, the space was meticulously organized, a deliberate attempt to counteract the chaos Eleanor often felt internally. Warm, honey-toned wood floors led to two treatment rooms, each equipped with state-of-the-art chiropractic tables and anatomical charts. A small waiting area, adorned with a vintage map of Seattle and a collection of succulents, offered a haven of calm for patients bracing themselves for the snap, crackle, and pop of spinal realignment. The air was always meticulously clean, a testament to Eleanor's germophobia and a necessity given the close physical contact inherent in her profession. Even the faint scent of essential oils, strategically diffused throughout the space, was chosen with care, designed to soothe anxiety and promote a sense of well-being. It was her sanctuary, a space where she could – usually – make people feel better, even when she felt like falling apart herself.
