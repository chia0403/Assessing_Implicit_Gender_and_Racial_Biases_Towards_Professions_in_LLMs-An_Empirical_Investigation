The shrill whine of the drill cut through the delicate strains of Debussy, momentarily drowning out the bubbling, gurgling symphony that was the water suction in Beatrice Eleanor Finch's operatory. Beatrice, a woman who believed even root canals deserved a soundtrack of the finer things, sighed internally. Mrs. Higgins always flinched at the high notes, dental or musical.

The year was 2042, and while the world outside Gleaming Smiles Dental Practice in the heart of downtown Neo-Phoenix boasted flying cars and genetically modified kale, inside, Beatrice's corner of the future felt stubbornly analog. The plush, forest green chairs, relics from a bygone era of comfort, were deliberately chosen to contrast with the sterile steel and digital displays of the latest dental technology. Gleaming Smiles wasn't just about fixing teeth; it was about providing an experience, a comforting pause in the relentless march of progress.

Her practice occupied the top floor of what was once a grand art deco skyscraper, now dwarfed by shimmering, gravity-defying structures that clawed at the turquoise Arizona sky. From her panoramic window, the sprawling metropolis unfolded like a tapestry of neon and chrome, a vibrant testament to human ingenuity. Below, hovercrafts zipped between buildings, leaving trails of shimmering light, while holographic advertisements shimmered in the air, hawking everything from virtual vacations to instant dental implants (much to Beatrice's professional chagrin).

Beatrice, her grey hair neatly pulled back in a low bun, her face etched with the kind of gentle concern only a lifetime of peering into gaping mouths could inspire, adjusted her magnifying lenses. Today, she was battling Mrs. Higgins' stubborn molar, a battlefield of decay hidden beneath layers of sugar-fueled regret.
