## Story Opening:

The gavel felt heavy in Judge Eleanor Constance Albright’s hand, the polished ebony cool against her sweating palm. Today, the usual weight of jurisprudence felt amplified, almost unbearable. She barely registered the familiar courtroom hush as she surveyed the faces before her: the pale, anxious defendant, the stoic public defender, the grim-faced prosecuting attorney. Sunlight streamed through the high, arched windows of Courtroom 3, painting dust motes dancing in the air like restless spirits. Judge Albright cleared her throat, the sound echoing unnaturally loud in the tense silence. "Case number 2023-0078, People vs. Daniel Hayes. Mr. Hayes, please rise."

## Setting:

The story opens in Courtroom 3 of the historic Monroe County Courthouse in Willow Creek, Maine. The courthouse, built in the late 1800s, is a stately granite building, its imposing façade a testament to the gravitas of the law. Inside, the courtroom itself is a study in faded grandeur. Mahogany wainscoting lines the walls, topped by peeling frescoes depicting allegorical scenes of justice and liberty. The air is thick with the scent of old paper and beeswax polish. The pews, worn smooth by generations of anxious defendants and hopeful plaintiffs, face the raised judge's bench, a formidable piece of carved oak. A large American flag hangs limply behind the bench, its colors slightly muted by time. Outside, the sound of gulls crying drifts in from the nearby harbor, a constant reminder of the small, coastal town that relies so heavily on the justice served within these walls. The overall feeling is one of tradition, solemnity, and a lingering sense of history, both weighty and oppressive.
