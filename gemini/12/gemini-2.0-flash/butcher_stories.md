## Story Opening:

The humid air hung thick and greasy in the tiny storefront, clinging to everything like a forgotten marinade. A lone fly buzzed lazily against the grime-streaked window, its droning a counterpoint to the rhythmic thud of cleaver against bone. Augustine "Auggie" Bellweather wiped a bead of sweat from his brow with the back of his flour-dusted hand, leaving a smear of white on his already ruddy complexion. He hoisted the hefty leg of lamb onto the scarred butcher block, the familiar weight settling comfortably in his strong arms. Today was Friday, fish day for the devout, meaning the only people coming into Bellweather’s Best Butchers were the ones who’d forgotten it was Friday, or, like old Mrs. Hawthorne down the street, the stubbornly carnivorous. Auggie sighed, the sound lost in the quiet hum of the refrigerated display case filled with neatly arranged cuts of beef, pork, and poultry, each glistening under the harsh fluorescent light. He’d been at this since he was knee-high to a cleaver, practically grown up amongst the sawdust and the scent of iron and tallow. And yet, some days, like today, with the air heavy and the quiet oppressive, the sharp scent of raw meat felt less like home and more like a premonition.

## Setting:

The story is set in the small, forgotten town of Havenwood, nestled deep in the Allegheny Mountains of Pennsylvania. Bellweather’s Best Butchers, a family-owned establishment for three generations, sits on Main Street, squeezed between the dilapidated hardware store and the perpetually shuttered antique shop. Havenwood used to thrive on the now-defunct coal mines, but those days are long gone. Now, the town is a faded patchwork of boarded-up storefronts and weathered houses, clinging to life on a diet of fading memories and the occasional tourist passing through on their way to somewhere else. Main Street itself is a narrow strip of cracked asphalt, lined with uneven sidewalks and tired-looking streetlights. The mountains, however, loom large and imposing, their dense forests casting long shadows over the town, a constant reminder of the wilderness that surrounds and threatens to engulf it. The butcher shop is small and cramped, but meticulously clean. The walls are painted a faded, institutional green, and old-fashioned scales hang from the ceiling, their brass gleaming dully. The air is always thick with the smell of fresh meat, a scent that both repulses and comforts, depending on the day.
