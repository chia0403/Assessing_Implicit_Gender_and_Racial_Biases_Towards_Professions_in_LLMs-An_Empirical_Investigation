## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights of Goldstein & Finch buzzed, an incessant soundtrack to Amelia Rose Hernandez's Thursday night. She squinted, massaging the bridge of her nose. Number crunching – specifically, dissecting the finances of a dead man notorious for hiding assets better than Houdini – was the only thing standing between her and a weekend binge-watching true crime documentaries with a tub of overpriced ice cream.

Amelia sighed, pushing a stray strand of dark hair behind her ear. The air conditioning, usually aggressive enough to give polar bears frostbite, seemed to have given up the ghost sometime after lunch. Sweat prickled at her hairline, mirroring the mounting frustration she felt with the spreadsheets on her monitor. She was so close, she could taste it. One more discrepancy, one more off-shore account to unearth, and maybe, just maybe, she could convince Mr. Goldstein that this case wasn't a lost cause.

A low, rhythmic tapping broke her concentration. Amelia glanced up, bracing herself for another patronizing lecture from Harold Finch on the importance of meticulously alphabetizing case files. Instead, she saw a silhouette in the doorway of her tiny, windowless office.

"Amelia?" a husky voice murmured.

Her heart skipped a beat. That wasn't Mr. Finch. And he never called her by her first name.

## Setting:

The story is primarily set in the law offices of **Goldstein & Finch**, a mid-sized firm specializing in estate law and probate, located in the Financial District of **Chicago, Illinois**.

*   **Amelia's Office:** A small, cramped, windowless room crammed with overflowing bookshelves and stacks of legal documents. The decor is strictly utilitarian: a generic desk, a basic ergonomic chair, and a motivational poster featuring a soaring eagle that Amelia found ironically depressing.
*   **Goldstein & Finch Office Overall:** The firm itself is a mix of modern and slightly outdated aesthetics. The reception area boasts sleek, minimalist furniture and a gleaming marble floor, while the individual offices tend to be cluttered and personalized, reflecting the long hours and demanding nature of the legal profession. The overall atmosphere is professional, if a little stiff, with a palpable undercurrent of competitive ambition.
*   **Chicago, Illinois:** The vibrant and bustling cityscape of Chicago serves as a backdrop, hinting at the high stakes and complex network of individuals that Amelia's cases often involve. The story may venture out to other locations within the city, such as probate courts, banks, and perhaps even the luxurious residences (or seedy haunts) of the deceased individuals whose lives and legacies Amelia investigates.
