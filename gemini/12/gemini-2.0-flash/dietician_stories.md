Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a character who is a dietician:

**Setting:** A bustling, open-plan kitchen in a trendy co-working space called "The Hive" in Portland, Oregon. Exposed brick walls are adorned with motivational posters featuring healthy foods. The aroma of kombucha and freshly ground coffee hangs in the air. Sunlight streams through the massive windows overlooking a vibrant street scene, filtering through hanging plants. In one corner, a small, meticulously organized "Nutrition Nook" is set up, complete with a standing desk, a whiteboard covered in meal plans, and a vibrant display of colorful produce.

**Story Opening:**

Dr. Amelia Chen, Registered Dietitian Nutritionist, pinched the bridge of her nose, the faint scent of kale and chia seeds clinging to her fingertips. It was Tuesday, the day she dreaded most: "Taste Test Tuesday" at The Hive. Each week, a different member of the co-working space was tasked with showcasing a new, usually "revolutionary," healthy food concoction. Amelia, as the resident nutrition expert, was invariably asked to weigh in, offering her professional (and usually politely dissenting) opinion. This week's offering? Cricket flour protein balls, flavored with spirulina and a mysterious "ancient grain" called amaranth.

Amelia sighed, the fluorescent lights of the Nutrition Nook reflecting in her oversized glasses. She loved her job, genuinely, but the constant barrage of dietary fads and misinformation swirling around her like a rogue dust bunny was enough to make even the most ardent advocate for balanced eating crave a deep-fried Twinkie. A perky voice broke through her thoughts.

"Dr. Chen! Ready to have your mind blown?"
