The fluorescent lights of the abandoned wing buzzed with a frantic, almost desperate energy, a stark contrast to the tomb-like silence that blanketed St. Augustine's Hospital at this hour. Dust motes, disturbed by the tremor in his hand, danced in the sickly yellow glow, each a tiny, accusing spotlight on Theodore Bartholomew Finch.

Theodore, a man shaped like a question mark from years of bending and reaching, gripped the handle of his mop tighter. He could hear his own pulse thrumming in his ears, a relentless rhythm that threatened to drown out the whispers he swore he’d been hearing for the past hour. Whispers that seemed to slither from the cracks in the peeling paint, from the shadows that clung to the corners of the long-forgotten psychiatric ward.

Theodore had been the overnight janitor at St. Augustine's, a sprawling, gothic edifice that had seen better days, for twenty-seven years. Twenty-seven years of scrubbing floors, emptying bins, and ignoring the prickling unease he felt within its walls. He told himself it was just the age of the building, the stories he'd overheard from the dwindling number of staff, the loneliness of the night shift. He told himself anything to avoid acknowledging the truth: St. Augustine's wasn’t just old; it was haunted.

And tonight, in the silent, derelict wing, that haunting felt very, very close. The air hung thick and heavy, like a shroud, and the metallic tang of disinfectant, usually a comfort, now felt like a morbid preparation for something unspeakable. He told himself he should just finish mopping the already-clean floor and get out, before the whispers turned into something more. But his feet were rooted to the spot, his breath caught in his throat. He knew, with a certainty that chilled him to the bone, that whatever was whispering wasn't going to let him leave just yet.
