The persistent drone of the ultrasonic scaler filled the small examination room, a high-pitched whine that burrowed into Dr. Albright's operatic playlist and threatened to drown out Pavarotti. This was it, Amelia Claire Hawthorne thought, her Tuesday soundtrack: Pavarotti versus plaque. It was a battle she usually enjoyed, but today, the familiar routine felt more like a prison sentence.

Amelia glanced out the window, a rectangle offering a sliver of freedom. Outside, the perpetually overcast sky of Astoria, Oregon, hung heavy over the town, mirroring the low-slung mood she'd woken up with. The quaint, Victorian-era buildings that usually charmed her now seemed like gloomy mausoleums, lining the streets like silent, disapproving ghosts. Even the gulls, usually raucous and entertaining, seemed subdued, their cries muffled by the damp air.

She was in the back exam room of "Smiles by the Sea," a cozy, if slightly cramped, dental practice owned by Dr. Robert Albright, a jovial man with a booming laugh and an impressive collection of porcelain teeth. The walls were painted a calming, nautical blue, adorned with framed prints of lighthouses and clipper ships. A small, antique wooden chest sat in the corner, overflowing with children's prizes: stickers, temporary tattoos, and brightly colored toothbrushes. The atmosphere was designed to soothe anxieties, but today, even the aroma of minty fluoride varnish couldn't lift Amelia's spirits.

Her patient, a burly fisherman named Dale Henderson, was snoring softly in the dental chair, his mouth agape, a small river of saliva pooling on the paper bib. Amelia paused her scaling, wiping her brow with the back of her gloved hand. He was normally a chatty one, full of tales of his latest catch, but today, he'd been unusually quiet, his eyes heavy with a weariness that resonated deeply with Amelia. Maybe it was the weather. Maybe it was something else. Whatever it was, she felt it too.
