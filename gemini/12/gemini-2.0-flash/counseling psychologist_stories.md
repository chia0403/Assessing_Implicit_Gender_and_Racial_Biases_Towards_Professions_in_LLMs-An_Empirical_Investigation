## Story Opening:

The lukewarm coffee did little to chase away the chill that seemed to cling to Dr. Eleanor Grace Ainsworth's bones. It was the perpetual chill of late autumn in Boston, a dampness that seeped into brick and bone alike. She stared out the rain-streaked window of her office, the Charles River a blurry, grey ribbon bisecting the city's muted palette. The sky pressed down, heavy and suffocating, mirroring the weight in her chest. It wasn't the weather, though. It was Mrs. Hawthorne. Again. The woman had a penchant for booking the last appointment of the day and then, with a theatrical sigh and a wavering voice, unraveling a tapestry of grievances that stretched back decades. Eleanor suspected Mrs. Hawthorne enjoyed the captive audience. As the clock ticked relentlessly towards six, Eleanor braced herself. The knock, when it finally came, was hesitant, almost apologetic, a sharp contrast to the storm of words that she knew was about to follow.

## Setting:

Dr. Eleanor Grace Ainsworth's office was located in a renovated brownstone on Marlborough Street in Boston's Back Bay. The exterior, a stately relic of Victorian architecture, contrasted with the modern, minimalist interior she had carefully curated. Cream-colored walls were adorned with abstract art in soothing blues and greens. Sunlight, when it dared to pierce through the Boston gloom, streamed through tall, arched windows, illuminating the carefully chosen furniture: a plush, dove-grey sofa, a comfortable armchair, and a small, antique writing desk. A low, glass-topped coffee table sat between them, usually littered with tissues and strategically placed water glasses. The room was designed to be a sanctuary, a place of quiet contemplation and vulnerability, a stark contrast to the bustling city outside and, sometimes, a frustratingly ironic echo of the emotional turmoil that unfolded within its walls. A small, antique bookshelf lined one wall, filled with well-worn volumes on psychology, philosophy, and a surprising number of detective novels, Eleanor's guilty pleasure.
