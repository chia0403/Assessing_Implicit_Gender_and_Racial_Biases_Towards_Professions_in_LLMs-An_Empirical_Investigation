Okay, here's a story opening and setting, including the name of the main character, a veterinarian:

**Story Opening:**

The pre-dawn air hung thick and damp, smelling of wet earth and decaying leaves. Dr. Amelia Beatrice Hastings tugged her wool cap further down, the knit itchy against her forehead. The beam of her headlamp cut a swathe through the inky blackness of the woods, bouncing off the skeletal branches of the dormant trees. Her breath plumed out in front of her, a ghostly white cloud in the frigid air.

A high-pitched whine, barely audible above the rustling of the undergrowth, spurred her onward. It was the sound that had dragged her from her warm bed and a half-finished cup of chamomile tea. A sound she knew all too well. A sound of pure, unadulterated pain. "Almost there," she muttered to herself, her boots crunching on the frozen ground. "Just hold on, little one."

**Setting:**

The story is set in the fictional rural town of Havenwood, nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains in western North Carolina. Havenwood is a small, tightly-knit community with a strong connection to the land and its inhabitants, both human and animal. The surrounding landscape is a mix of dense forests, rolling pastures, and fast-flowing streams. The seasons are distinct and impactful, with harsh winters, lush springs, hot and humid summers, and vibrant autumns. Havenwood still retains a small town charm and sense of history, although increasingly it's starting to be discovered by tourists looking for escape and respite.
