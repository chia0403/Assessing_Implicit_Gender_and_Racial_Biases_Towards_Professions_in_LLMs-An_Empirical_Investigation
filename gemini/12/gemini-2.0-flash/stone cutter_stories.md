## Story Opening:

The rasp of steel against granite was the first sound Elara Rosewood heard each morning, a familiar counterpoint to the dawn chorus. Today, however, the sound was different. There was a desperation in its rhythm, a ragged urgency that pulled her from sleep like a nagging cough. She pushed aside the thick, woolen blanket, the air in her small cottage biting at her exposed skin, and crossed to the window. The pre-dawn sky was a bruise of indigo and slate, barely beginning to lighten over the jagged peaks of the Greycrown Mountains. And down below, in the courtyard of the Rosewood Stone Works, Elara could just make out the hunched figure of her father, Silas Rosewood, his usually steady hands working with frantic, almost feverish speed on a block of granite. He shouldn't be working before dawn, especially not on his own. He never did. Something was terribly wrong.

## Setting:

The story is set in the small, isolated village of Stonehaven, nestled deep within the foothills of the formidable Greycrown Mountains. The village owes its existence entirely to the grey granite that forms the mountains' spine. Generations of Stonehaven residents have made their living quarrying and carving the stone, their lives interwoven with the cold, unyielding rock. The Rosewood Stone Works, owned and operated by Silas Rosewood, is one of the oldest and most respected workshops in the village, known for its intricate carvings and sturdy construction. The village itself is a collection of stout, stone buildings clustered around a central square, dominated by a towering monument to the villageâ€™s founder, a legendary stone cutter named Eamon Blackheart. Life in Stonehaven is hard, dictated by the seasons and the demands of the mountain. The people are stoic and resilient, their faces etched with the lines of wind and sun, their hands calloused and strong from a lifetime of working the stone. The atmosphere is generally quiet and peaceful, punctuated by the rhythmic clang of hammers and chisels, the murmur of the wind through the mountain passes, and the ever-present sense of the Greycrown Mountains looming large, watchful and ancient, over everything.
