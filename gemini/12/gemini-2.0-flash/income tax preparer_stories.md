## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights of the strip mall office hummed a monotonous song, a song Amelia Beatrice Finch had grown intimately familiar with over the past fifteen years. It was a sound as comforting, and as soul-numbing, as the drone of data entry and the endless stream of client anxieties. Outside, a weak winter sun tried its best to melt the grey slush lining the parking lot, but February in Minneapolis was a stubborn beast. Amelia, fortified with a lukewarm cup of Earl Grey and the unwavering belief that she could, in fact, make sense of anyone's chaotic financial life, leaned back in her ergonomic chair, the worn fabric creaking in protest. Today's schedule promised a tapestry of woe â€“ a recently divorced yoga instructor, a struggling freelance web designer, and, capping off the afternoon, the infamous Mr. Henderson, whose deductions were always...creative, to say the least. Amelia took a deep breath, straightened the stack of meticulously organized forms on her desk, and braced herself. Another tax season had officially begun.

## Setting:

The story is set in a small, somewhat drab office in a strip mall in **Minneapolis, Minnesota**, during the height of **tax season (February/March)**. The office, "Finch Financial Solutions," is a small, independent tax preparation business. It's clean but clearly shows its age.

**Key Details:**

*   **Inside:** The office is functional rather than stylish. The walls are painted a neutral beige, and the floor is covered in a worn, commercial-grade carpet. The furniture is practical and ergonomic, prioritized for comfort during long hours. A large window looks out onto the busy parking lot. A framed, slightly-yellowed certificate of accreditation hangs on the wall behind Amelia's desk. A small, cluttered waiting area sits just inside the entrance, furnished with uncomfortable plastic chairs and a stack of outdated magazines.
*   **Outside:** The strip mall is unremarkable, featuring a mix of small businesses - a dry cleaner, a nail salon, a pizza place, and a discount clothing store. The parking lot is perpetually busy, and during the winter, it is often covered in slush and ice.
*   **Atmosphere:** The atmosphere is one of quiet desperation and weary resignation. Clients come in burdened with their financial anxieties, seeking help and solutions. Amelia's office offers a brief respite from the chaos, a place where numbers are made sense of, and perhaps, where a little bit of hope can be found.
