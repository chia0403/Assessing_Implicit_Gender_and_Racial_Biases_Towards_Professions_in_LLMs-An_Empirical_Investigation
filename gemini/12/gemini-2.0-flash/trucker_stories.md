The rain was coming down in sheets, blurring the already indistinct lines of the I-40 as the semi barreled westward. Inside the cab, a symphony of white noise – the hum of the engine, the rhythmic slap of windshield wipers against glass, the static-laced country music crackling from the radio – formed a familiar, almost comforting backdrop. Behind the wheel, hands steady on the grip, sat Amelia Grace Harding, a trucker with more miles under her belt than most folks had birthdays.

Amelia wasn't built like the stereotypes. She wasn't a burly, bearded man, nor was she a petite blonde bombshell trying to prove a point. Amelia was solid, grounded, with shoulders that sloped comfortably, and hands calloused from years of maneuvering steering wheels and securing cargo. Her dark hair, usually pulled back in a practical braid, was starting to frizz around her face from the humidity, and the lines around her kind brown eyes were deepening, etched in by sun, wind, and the endless road ahead.

The setting was a particularly desolate stretch of I-40 in Oklahoma, somewhere between Oklahoma City and the Texas border. Flat, open fields stretched out on either side, punctuated by the occasional skeletal oil derrick silhouetted against the stormy sky. The air hung thick and heavy, pregnant with the threat of more rain, and the only sign of life was the occasional glint of headlights approaching or receding in the rearview mirror. It was the kind of place that made you feel utterly alone, utterly insignificant, and utterly dependent on the reliability of your rig. And right now, Amelia Grace Harding was feeling all three.
