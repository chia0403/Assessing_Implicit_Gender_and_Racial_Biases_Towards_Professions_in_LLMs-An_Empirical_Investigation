Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring an insurance agent named... let's go with...

**Story Opening and Setting:**

The salt-laced wind whipped through Amelia Beatrice Penhaligon’s thin raincoat, stinging her cheeks as she wrestled with her umbrella. She cursed under her breath, the words lost in the relentless squawk of seagulls circling overhead. "Bloody Cornish weather," she muttered, finally managing to collapse the defiant black fabric.

Amelia was a creature of routine, a quality that served her well in her profession. As a senior insurance agent for "Coastal Coverage," her days typically began with a strong pot of Earl Grey and a meticulous review of her client files. Today, however, that routine was disrupted. She found herself standing on the blustery quayside of Port Isaac, a postcard-perfect fishing village clinging to the rugged North Cornish coast.

Cobalt blue fishing boats bobbed restlessly in the harbor, their masts clanging a discordant tune against the slate rooftops of the tightly packed cottages. The air smelled of brine, fish, and something else... something vaguely acrid that Amelia couldn't quite place. The quaint charm of the village, usually so appealing, felt oppressive this morning, a stage set for some unknown drama.

She clutched the manila envelope tighter against her chest. It contained the details of her newest client, a Mr. Silas Blackwood, a reclusive artist who'd inherited a sprawling, dilapidated manor house on the cliffs just outside of town. He was seeking comprehensive insurance coverage, a request that, on the surface, seemed perfectly ordinary. But something about Mr. Blackwood’s gruff voice on the phone, the unsettlingly high coverage amount he requested for his *antique collection*, and the fact that he lived in what the locals referred to as "Blackwood Hall," had set Amelia's finely tuned insurance-agent instincts tingling.

Amelia shivered, not entirely from the cold. This wasn't going to be a typical policy review. This felt like a cover story, and Amelia had a unsettling feeling there was something else far more sinister underneath the surface.
