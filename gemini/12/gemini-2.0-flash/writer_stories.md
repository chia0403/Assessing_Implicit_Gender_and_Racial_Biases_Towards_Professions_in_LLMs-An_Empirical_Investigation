The scent of brine and rotting seaweed hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the pristine white linens and antique furniture that filled the writing room. This incongruity, a constant battle between the refined interior and the untamed exterior, was precisely why Alistair Bartholomew Finch found solace here. He sat hunched over his mahogany desk, the late afternoon sun painting stripes of gold across his wrinkled brow, a half-smoked pipe cooling precariously in an ashtray overflowing with ash. Alistair, a writer of gothic romances whose popularity had peaked a decade prior, stared at the blank page in his typewriter with the same weary resignation a sailor might reserve for an approaching storm.

The house, passed down through generations of Finches, was as much a character in Alistair's life as any he had penned onto paper. Its drafty corridors whispered tales of shipwrecks and smugglers, its creaking floorboards echoed the footsteps of long-dead relatives, and its panoramic view of the churning Atlantic served as a constant reminder of the vast, unpredictable forces that lay just beyond its crumbling walls. He was trapped here, not by chains or obligation, but by a profound, unsettling inertia. The house, and the ghosts it held, were his prison, and his only muse.
