The insistent shrill of the telephone sliced through the pre-dawn stillness of Amelia Hayes's small apartment. Sunlight hadn't yet dared peek over the brick buildings that crammed together on Bleecker Street, leaving the room shrouded in a dusky blue twilight. Amelia groaned, burrowing further under the threadbare comforter, her hand blindly groping for the receiver.

The setting was quintessential Greenwich Village, 1958. Amelia’s apartment, perched on the fourth floor of a walk-up above a dusty antique shop, was a testament to bohemian living and tight finances. Overflowing bookshelves lined the walls, threatening to topple over at the slightest tremor. Stacks of newspapers and magazines formed precarious towers in the corners, a physical manifestation of Amelia’s professional life bleeding into her personal space. The aroma of stale coffee perpetually clung to the air, a lingering reminder of late nights spent hunched over her typewriter, chasing deadlines and the elusive truth. The chipped paint and mismatched furniture told a story of previous tenants – artists, poets, and activists – all drawn to the Village's vibrant, albeit gritty, allure. And right now, that alluring grit was about to be disrupted by whatever lurked on the other end of the phone.
