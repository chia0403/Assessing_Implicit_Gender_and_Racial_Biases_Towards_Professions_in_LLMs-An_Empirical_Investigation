**Story Opening & Setting:**

The aroma of lavender-scented disinfectant mingled with the metallic tang of sweat, a potent cocktail familiar to Isolde "Izzy" Moreau. It was 5:55 AM, and the pre-dawn gloom clung stubbornly to the windows of "The Grind House," a boutique fitness studio nestled between a trendy vegan bakery and a pawn shop on Elm Street in the heart of Maplewood, New Jersey.
