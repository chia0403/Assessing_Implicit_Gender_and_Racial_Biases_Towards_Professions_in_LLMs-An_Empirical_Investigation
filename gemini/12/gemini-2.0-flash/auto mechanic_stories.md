The gritty smell of motor oil and burnt rubber was as familiar to Arthur "Art" Petrovich as the shape of his own calloused hands.  Sunlight, strained and weak through the grease-streaked windows of Petrovich's Auto Repair, painted dust motes dancing in the air.  Art wiped his brow with the back of his hand, leaving a streak of grime across his forehead that mirrored the permanent lines etched there by years of wrestling stubborn engines.

Petrovich's Auto Repair wasn't exactly a thriving business.  Tucked away on the wrong side of the tracks in the forgotten industrial district of Havenwood, Pennsylvania, it mostly catered to the rusted-out relics of the town's blue-collar population â€“ folks who patched and prayed their cars would last just one more paycheck.  The building itself was a testament to its age, a hulking brick box with a faded sign barely clinging to its moorings.  Inside, a single, bare bulb sputtered intermittently, casting long, ominous shadows across the cluttered workshop.  The air hung thick with the scent of yesterday's failures and the faint promise of tomorrow's challenges, a potent cocktail that Art Petrovich both loathed and thrived on.
