## Story Opening:

The rain hammered against the windows of "The Gilded Lily," mimicking the frantic beat in Isabella "Izzy" Rossi's chest. Outside, Seattle's grey sky bled into the cobblestone streets of Pioneer Square. Inside, the amber glow of Edison bulbs struggled against the oppressive gloom, casting long, dancing shadows across the vintage bar.

Izzy, her dark hair pulled back in a practical braid, meticulously wiped down the mahogany surface with a practiced hand. Each swirl of the damp cloth was a silent mantra, a futile attempt to smooth the anxieties bubbling inside her. It wasn't just the weather, or the usual Monday night blues. It was the feeling, sharp and persistent as a splinter, that something was about to change.

The clock above the cash register ticked with agonizing slowness. 7:57 PM. Any minute now.

The heavy oak door creaked open, letting in a blast of icy wind and a figure shrouded in a dark trench coat. Izzy plastered on her most welcoming smile, the one she usually reserved for regulars like old Mr. Henderson, who always ordered a Manhattan and told stories about his days as a lumberjack. But the figure didn't approach the bar. They paused just inside the doorway, their face obscured by the shadows of the hood, and Izzy's heart hammered a little harder. This wasn't just another customer seeking refuge from the rain. This was something else entirely.
