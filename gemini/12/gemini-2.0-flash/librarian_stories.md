The scent of aged paper and lemon polish clung to the air, a familiar comfort to Eleanor Rose Thorne. Outside, the relentless January wind howled a mournful tune against the gothic windows of the Blackwood Historical Society and Library, nestled on a quiet, snow-dusted street in the sleepy town of Havenwood, Maine. Eleanor, Head Librarian and the library's sole employee, barely registered it; she was too engrossed in the brittle, leather-bound volume open before her on the mahogany desk.

The library itself was a cavern of forgotten treasures. Dark oak shelves, taller than Eleanor herself, stretched towards the ornate, plasterwork ceiling, groaning under the weight of centuries of knowledge. Each shelf was meticulously labeled in elegant, faded script: "Local Histories," "Maritime Lore," "Ornithology of the North Atlantic," and so on. Dust motes danced in the weak afternoon sunlight that struggled to pierce the gloom, illuminating forgotten portraits of stern-faced benefactors staring down from the walls. The air hung heavy with secrets, whispering stories of sailors lost at sea, of the town's founding fathers, and of the strange, unexplained events that seemed to cling to Havenwood like the salt air. Today, however, Eleanor was less interested in the town's past and more interested in the curious symbols etched into the margins of a 17th-century grimoire she'd discovered tucked away in the restricted section.
