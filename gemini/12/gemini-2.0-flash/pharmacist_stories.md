Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a pharmacist named…

**Story Opening:**

The bell above the door jingled a tired, familiar melody, a sound that had been as much a part of Elara Finch's life as the scent of rubbing alcohol and faded roses.  She barely looked up from the meticulously labelled bottles she was restocking, her fingers dancing over the plastic with a practised ease.  "Be with you in a sec," she called out, her voice a low murmur that was quickly absorbed by the quiet hum of the refrigerator behind the counter. Outside, the wind picked up, rattling the ancient windows of Finch & Sons Pharmacy.  Elara sighed, the small puff of air fogging her glasses. November in Havenwood. Predictable and unforgiving.  Suddenly, a throat cleared from beyond the shelves of cough syrup. Elara finally looked up, and everything suddenly felt off-kilter.

**Setting:**

Finch & Sons Pharmacy sits on the corner of Elm Street and Oak Avenue in Havenwood, Maine, a town that boasts a population just shy of 3,000 souls.  The building itself is a relic, a two-story structure with a faded brick facade and a peeling awning that bravely announces its presence in faded blue lettering.  Inside, the air is thick with the comforting aroma of old medicines mingling with the faint, sweet smell of the penny candy jar that sits by the register – a tradition started by Elara's grandfather and stubbornly maintained despite the times.  The pharmacy's walls are lined with wooden shelves, overflowing with everything from prescription medications to locally made soaps and herbal remedies.  A small, cluttered dispensary sits in the back, where Elara compounds prescriptions with the same care and precision her father and grandfather instilled in her. The floors creak with every step, and the lighting is perpetually dim, casting long shadows that dance across the dusty shelves.  It's a place steeped in history, a place where everyone knows your name, your ailments, and your favorite brand of cough drops.  It's Havenwood’s heart, and for Elara Finch, it's always been home.
