The scent of industrial-strength cleaner mingled with the sweet aroma of stale Cheerios, a concoction only truly appreciated, or perhaps endured, within the walls of Happy Hearts Daycare. Inside, nestled between a miniature kitchen adorned with plastic fruit and a construction zone overflowing with Duplo blocks, sat Beatrice Clementine Ainsworth, attempting to coax life back into a wilting drawing of a purple dinosaur.

Happy Hearts wasn't fancy. It was a small, family-run affair tucked into the bottom floor of a brick apartment building in a working-class neighborhood on the outskirts of Havenwood, a town known for its picturesque landscapes and perpetually overcast skies. Beatrice, at twenty-four, had been working there for almost three years, and in that time, sheâ€™d become adept at deciphering toddler hieroglyphics, mediating territorial disputes over the red crayon, and feigning enthusiasm for the tenth rendition of "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star."

The afternoon sun, weak and watery, filtered through the barred windows, painting pale squares on the linoleum floor. A low hum permeated the air, a symphony of quiet chaos: the rhythmic whir of the fish tank in the corner, the muffled shriek of laughter from the block corner, and the gentle snores emanating from little Timmy, who had finally succumbed to naptime in his caterpillar-shaped sleeping bag. It was, Beatrice thought with a tired smile, perfectly, predictably, Happy Hearts.
