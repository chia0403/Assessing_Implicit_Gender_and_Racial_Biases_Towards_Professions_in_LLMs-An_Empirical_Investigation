## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The year is 1957. A thick fog, the kind that clings to everything like a damp shroud, has rolled in off the Atlantic and settled over the sprawling, windswept grounds of Blackwood Manor. The Manor itself, a hulking edifice of grey stone, sits perched on the cliffs overlooking the ocean, its numerous windows like vacant eyes staring out into the swirling mist. The air smells of salt, brine, and the lingering scent of freshly cut grass, a scent struggling to overcome the prevailing dampness.

**Story Opening:**

The rhythmic snick-snick-snick of the hand shears was the only sound that dared break the oppressive silence. Bartholomew "Bart" Ainsworth, a man whose face seemed permanently etched with the lines of wind and weather, moved slowly along the meticulously trimmed rose bushes that bordered the Manor’s east wing. Bart, head groundskeeper of Blackwood Manor for the past thirty years, barely registered the dampness seeping into his worn leather gloves. His focus was solely on the roses, coaxing them into bloom even as autumn’s chill began to bite. These particular roses, a delicate shade of cream known as ‘Moonlight Whispers,’ were Mrs. Blackwood's favorites, and Bart wouldn't dream of disappointing her, especially not today. Today was the anniversary, and the Manor held its breath with a palpable, unspoken dread. As Bart snipped a spent bloom, a sudden, mournful cry echoed from the cliffs below, piercing through the fog and sending a shiver down his spine. He knew that cry. It was the call of the Selkie, and it always came on this day. Bart straightened, his hand instinctively reaching for the silver compass he always wore beneath his shirt, a small trinket his grandmother had given him, a shield against the things that whispered on the wind and lurked in the shadows of Blackwood Manor. He muttered a silent prayer, hoping that this year, the Manor, and Mrs. Blackwood, would be spared.
