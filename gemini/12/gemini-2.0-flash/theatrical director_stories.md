## The Story Opening:

The air in the abandoned church hung thick with dust motes, dancing in the weak sunlight filtering through the stained-glass windows depicting a rather forlorn Saint Sebastian. Bartholomew "Bart" Finch, Director Extraordinaire (or at least, that’s what he liked to call himself, especially when facing empty pews in a dilapidated building), coughed, flapping a hand theatrically in front of his face. He surveyed the nave with a critical eye, a glint of manic inspiration warring with a practical assessment of the structural integrity.

"Magnificent, isn't she, Dolores?" he called out, his voice echoing in the cavernous space. No response, save for the rustling of pigeons nesting somewhere high above. He sighed. Dolores, his long-suffering assistant and the sole human soul brave enough to follow him to this forgotten corner of the city, was probably outside wrestling with the temperamental generator.

Tonight, Bart was going to breathe new life into this decaying edifice. Tonight, he was going to stage the most ambitious, the most audacious, the most... *budget-restricted* production of "Hamlet" the world had ever seen. He just needed to figure out how to get a ghost effect using a sheet, a spotlight, and a prayer.

## The Setting:

**St. Jude's Abandoned Church, on the outskirts of Port Blossom, Massachusetts.**

Once a vibrant hub of the local community, St. Jude’s had fallen into disrepair decades ago, its congregation dwindling until only dust bunnies and stray cats remained. The towering Gothic architecture, while still impressive, showed the ravages of time. Paint peeled from the walls, plaster crumbled like forgotten promises, and the once-gleaming brass fixtures were now coated in a thick layer of verdigris.

The surrounding neighborhood mirrored the church's decline. Once a prosperous blue-collar area, it now bore the scars of economic hardship. Vacant storefronts lined the streets, their windows boarded up. Graffiti adorned the brick walls, a defiant scream against the backdrop of urban decay. The only signs of life were the occasional stray dog scavenging for food and the distant rumble of the train that ran along the edge of the city, a constant reminder of the world that had moved on without Port Blossom.
