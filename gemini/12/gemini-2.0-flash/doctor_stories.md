## Story Opening:

The sterile scent of antiseptic and old coffee clung to Dr. Annelise Marie Dubois like a shroud. It was a familiar comfort, a constant in the chaotic symphony of her life, but tonight, it did little to soothe the gnawing anxiety that tightened her chest. Outside, the biting December wind howled through the corridors of St. Jude's General Hospital, rattling the windows and whipping up flurries of snow that danced briefly in the harsh glare of the parking lot lights. Inside, Annelise stared at the radiology report displayed on her monitor, the stark black and white images a silent accusation. The shadows within the scans were subtle, almost imperceptible, but they were undeniably there. And Annelise knew, with a chilling certainty that burrowed deep into her bones, that they spelled trouble for one of her most vulnerable patients.

## Setting:

The story begins in **St. Jude's General Hospital**, a large, somewhat dilapidated public hospital located in **Buffalo, New York**. Built in the 1950s, it has seen better days. The paint is peeling in places, the linoleum floors are scuffed and worn, and the equipment, while functional, is often outdated. However, the hospital serves a vital role in the community, providing crucial medical care to a diverse population, many of whom are uninsured or underinsured. The hospital is staffed by a mix of seasoned veterans who have dedicated their lives to public service and bright-eyed young residents eager to make a difference. The atmosphere is often tense, a constant push and pull between the limited resources and the ever-increasing demands of patient care. The harsh Buffalo winters only exacerbate the situation, bringing an influx of weather-related injuries and illnesses that strain the already overloaded system.
