The steam from Amelia Grace Thornton's Earl Grey curled upward, blurring the already smudged edges of the rain-streaked windows of "The Willow Bloom Respite Center." Outside, the November gloom had settled over the Berkshires like a wet, wool blanket. The gnarled branches of the willow trees that gave the center its name were stark silhouettes against the gray sky, their bareness mirroring the feeling in Amelia's own heart. She took a slow, deliberate sip of her tea, willing its warmth to penetrate the chill that had been clinging to her ever since Mrs. Hawthorne, a spunky 92-year-old battling arthritis and a sharp wit, had confessed that the annual Thanksgiving pie-baking contest was the only thing keeping her going.

The Willow Bloom Respite Center was a haven, or at least, it was supposed to be. Tucked away in the sleepy town of Stockbridge, Massachusetts, it catered to elderly residents struggling with cognitive or physical decline, offering a safe and stimulating environment to help them maintain their independence and dignity. Amelia had been drawn to its quaint charm and commitment to holistic care after leaving the sterile, impersonal environment of a large city hospital. Here, she could spend more time with each individual, tailor her occupational therapy to their specific needs and desires, and witness the small, incremental victories that made her job so rewarding. But lately, the "small victories" felt harder to come by, and the weight of everyone's needs was starting to press down on her.
