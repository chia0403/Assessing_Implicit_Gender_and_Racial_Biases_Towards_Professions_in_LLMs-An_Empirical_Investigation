## Story Opening:

The chill October wind whipped around Professor Eleanor Vance's ankles, tugging at the hem of her tweed skirt. She hunched deeper into her well-worn trench coat, the collar scratching against her jaw. Across the cobblestone square, the gargoyle-laden facade of Blackwell University loomed, a gothic silhouette against the bruised purple of the dawn sky. It was far too early, even for a historian with a morbid fascination for the past. But something had pulled her from sleep, a nagging unease she couldn't quite define, a feeling as persistent and unwelcome as the damp clinging to the air. She just hoped whatever restless spirit had woken her wasn't lurking within the hallowed halls, waiting to disrupt her lecture on the Salem Witch Trials.

## Setting:

**Blackwell University**, nestled in the small, historic town of Aylesbury, Massachusetts, is an institution steeped in tradition and secrets. Founded in 1788, its architecture reflects a somber, imposing grandeur. Buildings constructed from dark grey stone boast intricate carvings, arched doorways, and countless windows that seem to peer out with watchful eyes. Ivy, thick and ancient, clings to the walls, obscuring hidden corners and adding to the air of mystery. The grounds are meticulously maintained, with sprawling lawns, ancient oak trees, and a scattering of statues depicting esteemed figures from the university's past. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth, fallen leaves, and the faint, persistent odor of aged parchment emanating from the library. While the university attracts bright, ambitious students from around the world, a sense of history, and perhaps something more sinister, pervades every corner of its campus. The town of Aylesbury itself is a sleepy New England hamlet, seemingly untouched by time, with quaint shops, a picturesque town square, and a population deeply connected to the university's past.
