The scent of mildew and despair hung thick in the air, a pungent perfume that only a truly dedicated plumber could appreciate – or at least tolerate. Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins adjusted the brim of his Chicago Cubs cap, the worn fabric offering little protection from the drip, drip, drip echoing from somewhere deep within the bowels of the dilapidated Victorian. He sighed, the sound a weary exhale that joined the mournful chorus of leaky pipes.

Bart was standing in the basement of Mrs. Eleanor Abernathy's house, a three-story gingerbread nightmare that had seen better days, and possibly, better tenants. The low-hanging ceiling, crisscrossed with exposed pipes and cobwebs thick as cotton candy, made him stoop. The only light came from the bare bulb swinging precariously from a frayed wire, casting dancing shadows that played tricks on his already tired eyes. He could hear the faint strains of opera music filtering down from the floors above, a dramatic accompaniment to his impending plumbing woes.

This wasn't just any plumbing job, mind you. This was the kind of plumbing job that made him question his life choices. Mrs. Abernathy had described the problem as a "minor gurgle," but Bart, a seasoned professional with twenty years of experience unclogging the unmentionable, knew that no plumbing issue in a house this old was ever truly minor. He braced himself, grabbed his trusty pipe wrench, "Bertha," and plunged into the darkness, ready to face whatever horrors the Abernathy basement had to offer. He just hoped it didn’t involve any actual ghosts, because Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins dealt with water, not the supernatural.
