The June sun, a malevolent eye in the cloudless sky, beat down on Elara Penelope Finch's neck, turning the tendrils that had escaped her messy bun into sticky, irritating strands. Dust motes danced in the shimmering heat haze rising off the freshly tilled soil of Mrs. Higgins’ prize-winning rose garden. Elara wiped a bead of sweat from her brow with the back of her dirt-smudged hand, leaving a brown streak across her forehead. She surveyed her work: neat rows of petunias, their vibrant purple a stark contrast to the manicured green lawn. It was good work, honest work, the kind of work that let her be outside and think, a rare commodity these days.

The setting was the quaint, almost aggressively charming town of Willow Creek, nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. Every house had a porch swing, every lawn was meticulously maintained, and every resident seemed to know your business before you did. Elara had arrived in Willow Creek five years ago, seeking an escape from the city's suffocating pressure. She'd started "Finch's Flora & Fauna," a landscaping business that catered to the town's particular obsession with floral perfection. While the work wasn't glamorous, it provided a comfortable living and a degree of anonymity, a privilege she fiercely guarded. But the tranquility of Willow Creek was starting to feel… brittle. Like a perfectly manicured lawn hiding a festering rot beneath the surface. And Elara, with her keen eye for detail and her aversion to pretense, was beginning to suspect she was about to unearth something far more than weeds.
