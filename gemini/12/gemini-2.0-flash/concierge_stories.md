Okay, here's a story opening and setting, focusing on the concierge:

**Setting:**

The grand, but subtly aging, Hotel de l'Étoile du Nord in Nice, France. Sunlight streams through the enormous windows of the lobby, catching the dust motes dancing in the air. Worn, but meticulously polished, marble floors gleam underfoot. Ornately carved pillars support a high, frescoed ceiling depicting scenes of the French Riviera's golden age. The air hums with a mixture of languages – French, English, Russian, Arabic, and a dozen others. While the hotel was once the undisputed queen of the Promenade des Anglais, a newer, flashier establishment down the street now holds that crown, leaving the de l'Étoile du Nord to rely on its history, discreet service, and unwavering elegance to attract its clientele.

**Opening:**

Jean-Luc Dubois, Hotel de l'Étoile du Nord's head concierge, adjusted the knot of his perfectly tied navy tie. His reflection stared back from the polished brass surface of the reception desk – a lean, handsome face etched with the subtle weariness that comes from anticipating and fulfilling the whims of the wealthy and occasionally eccentric. At precisely 8:00 AM, he smoothed an invisible wrinkle from the impeccably pressed lapel of his suit jacket and turned his attention to the day ahead, marked by a list of to-dos carefully written in elegant cursive on a small, leather-bound notepad. First: arrange a private helicopter tour for Mrs. Van Derlyn, who had requested "something that sings of opulence." Second: source a rare bottle of Château Margaux 1982 for Mr. Petrochenko, who, rumor had it, had made his fortune in less-than-savory ventures. Third, and most perplexing: decipher the cryptic message left by Mademoiselle Dubois, which simply read, "The swallows return at dusk. Look to the rose garden." His sister had a flair for theatrics, but Jean-Luc could never tell if she were seeking his assistance, or simply pulling his chain. The bell atop the desk jingled. Madame Dubois's shenanigans would have to wait. Duty called.
