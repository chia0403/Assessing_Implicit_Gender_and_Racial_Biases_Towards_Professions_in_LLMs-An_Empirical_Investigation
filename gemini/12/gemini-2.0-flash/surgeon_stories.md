Okay, here's a story opening with a surgeon character and setting:

**Opening:**

The low thrum of the dehumidifier was Dr. Evelyn Grace Ramirez's only companion in the pre-dawn gloom. It whirred steadily, battling the oppressive humidity that clung to everything in coastal Louisiana like a stubborn shadow. Evelyn stood before the panoramic window of her apartment, a steaming mug of chicory coffee warming her hands. Beyond the glass, the Mississippi River was a sluggish, coffee-colored serpent, barely discernible beneath the pre-dawn mist that clung to the water's surface. The only light pierced the gloom from the distant lights of the oil refineries that fringed the horizon, blinking red warnings against the encroaching darkness.

She took a slow sip, the bitter coffee a familiar comfort against the knot of tension that had taken root in her stomach. Today was the day. The day she would attempt a minimally invasive aortic valve replacement on a patient deemed inoperable just months ago by specialists in Houston. A risky procedure. A desperate gamble. But Elias Dubois, her patient, deserved a chance.

**Setting:**

Evelyn's apartment is located in the Warehouse District of New Orleans, in a converted sugar refinery loft. It's spacious, minimalist in design, with exposed brick walls and polished concrete floors. The large windows offer a stunning view of the Mississippi River. Her decor is sparse but carefully chosen: a vibrant abstract painting by a local artist, a comfortable leather armchair, and bookshelves overflowing with medical texts and the occasional well-worn novel. The kitchen is modern and gleaming, but rarely used beyond brewing coffee. The overall feel is one of quiet efficiency, a sanctuary designed to counteract the chaos and emotional weight of her demanding profession. It smells faintly of coffee, disinfectant (from her work bag), and the salty tang of the river.
