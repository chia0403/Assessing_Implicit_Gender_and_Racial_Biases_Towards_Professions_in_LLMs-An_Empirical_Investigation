## Story Opening:

The insistent buzz of the antique rotary phone ripped Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth from the comforting warmth of her chamomile tea. She sighed, the delicate porcelain cup clattering softly against its saucer as she set it down. Outside, the October wind howled through the towering pines that surrounded her secluded cabin, a sound that usually soothed her, but tonight felt like a harbinger of something unsettling. Hesitantly, she reached for the phone, its black Bakelite surface cold and slick beneath her fingers.

"Dr. Ainsworth," she answered, her voice a low, calming cadence honed over years of listening to the anxieties and traumas of others.

A strained, raspy voice crackled through the line, barely audible over the static. "You... you have to help me... before it's too late..."

The line went dead.

## Setting:

Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth's cabin, "Havenwood," is nestled deep within the heart of the Redwood National and State Parks in Northern California. It's a small, rustic structure, built in the 1930s by a reclusive artist who sought solace in the ancient forest. The exterior is weathered redwood, darkened with age and moss, blending seamlessly with the surrounding trees. A thick, green carpet of ferns and undergrowth surrounds the cabin, isolating it from the outside world.

Inside, the cabin is cozy and meticulously organized. Walls are lined with bookshelves overflowing with psychology texts, literature, and antique volumes on folklore and mythology. A crackling fireplace provides warmth and light, casting dancing shadows across the room. Comfortable armchairs and a worn leather couch offer inviting spaces for contemplation and conversation. The scent of woodsmoke and chamomile hangs in the air, a testament to Eleanor's preference for simplicity and tranquility. The only modern intrusion is the aforementioned antique rotary phone, stubbornly clinging to its place in the past, and a small, discreet computer tucked away in a corner of the room, used primarily for research and occasional online consultations. The cabin is a sanctuary, a place where Eleanor can escape the pressures of her practice and reconnect with the restorative power of nature. But tonight, the sanctuary feels threatened, the peace shattered by a single, desperate phone call.
