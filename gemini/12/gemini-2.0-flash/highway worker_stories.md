## Story Opening and Setting:

The rumble of a semi-truck, laden with something vaguely industrial and smelling of hot rubber, shook the very ground beneath Ronald Earl Johnson's boots. He squinted, wiping the sweat from his brow with the back of his gloved hand. The dust devils were dancing again, spiraling madly across the shimmering asphalt of Highway 17, like miniature tornadoes mocking his exhaustion.

The setting was the Mojave Desert in the heart of August, a landscape brutal and beautiful in equal measure. Heat radiated upwards in visible waves, blurring the horizon. The highway, a black ribbon bisecting the ochre and scrub-brush landscape, stretched endlessly towards a horizon that was always just out of reach. To the east, the jagged peaks of the Amargosa Range serrated the sky, their harshness softened only by the atmospheric haze.

Ronald, a man built like a brick shithouse but with a heart softer than the asphalt he worked on, sighed. He'd been out here since dawn, patching potholes and enduring the endless onslaught of traffic. His bright orange work vest, usually a beacon of safety, felt like a furnace strapped to his chest. Today, the monotony was getting to him. It wasn't just the heat, or the endless stream of cars, or even the gnawing loneliness that settled in his bones out here on the open road. No, it was something else, a feeling he couldn't quite place, like a low hum vibrating beneath the surface of the world.

He spat into the dust, the sound swallowed by the desert's vastness. Something feltâ€¦wrong.
