The fluorescent lights of Sterling & Sinclair, Attorneys at Law, hummed a relentless, almost hypnotic drone. For Beatrice Eleanor Finch, it was the soundtrack to Tuesday, and indeed, every other weekday that wasn’t a holiday. She sat, ramrod straight, behind the polished mahogany reception desk, her fingers hovering over the keyboard, ready to deflect the incessant barrage of phone calls and walk-ins that comprised the backbone of her workday. Outside the plate-glass windows, the Chicago wind howled a mournful dirge, rattling the panes and swirling snow against the grimy cityscape. It was the kind of bone-chilling cold that seeped into the very marrow, a cold that Beatrice, even buried under a meticulously ironed floral blouse and a sensible grey cardigan, could feel nipping at her extremities. The reception area itself was a study in corporate blandness – tasteful abstract art that no one ever looked at, uncomfortable leather chairs for clients waiting for their appointments, and a perpetually wilting fern in a ceramic pot that Beatrice had long given up hope of resurrecting. This was her domain, a carefully curated illusion of calm in the swirling vortex of legal battles fought within the building's 38 floors. And today, she sensed, was going to be a particularly turbulent one.
