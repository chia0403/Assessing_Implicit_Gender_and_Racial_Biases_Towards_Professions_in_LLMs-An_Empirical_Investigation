The late afternoon sun, a bruised apricot hue, bled through the grimy window of the studio, painting dust motes dancing in the air. Eleanor Vance, her palette a riot of barely-touched colors, scowled at the canvas. It stared back, blank and insolent. Outside, the city - Paris, of course, where else would a failing artist come to fail spectacularly? - hummed with the muted symphony of honking taxis, chattering voices, and the distant clatter of a streetcar. She could practically taste the grit and exhaust fumes that coated the building, a converted garret tucked away in the Marais district, far from the glamorous ateliers of Montmartre. Eleanorâ€™s studio, a chaotic testament to abandoned inspiration and questionable housekeeping, was a cramped space overflowing with half-finished canvases leaning against damp walls, brushes caked with dried paint, and the pungent aroma of turpentine that clung to everything, including her threadbare clothes. Eleanor herself, dressed in paint-splattered overalls and a faded beret, resembled a rather disgruntled magpie, her dark hair escaping its confines in unruly tendrils around her face, her brow furrowed in perpetual concentration. Today, however, that concentration felt more like a siege than a creative spark. The canvas remained stubbornly, maddeningly, white.
