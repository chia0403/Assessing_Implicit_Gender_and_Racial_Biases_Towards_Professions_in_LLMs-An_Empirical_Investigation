The scent of beeswax and silk hung heavy in the air of "Madame Evangeline's Atelier de RÃªves," a tiny shop tucked away on a cobblestone lane just off the Place des Vosges in Paris. Sunlight, strained through layers of antique lace curtains, painted dancing patterns on the overflowing bolts of fabric that lined the walls. Here, amidst the hushed whispers of threads and the rhythmic snick of scissors, lived and breathed Evangeline Moreau, dressmaker extraordinaire.

Evangeline, all of twenty-eight years old, with nimble fingers perpetually pricked and a heart brimming with more dreams than she had space for in her small atelier, stood perched on a velvet stool, her brown eyes narrowed in concentration. A half-finished gown, a riot of emerald green silk and intricate beading, lay draped across a mannequin before her. Tonight, it would grace the back of the notorious socialite, Comtesse de Valois, at a glittering opera gala. Evangeline had poured weeks into the piece, each stitch a testament to her dedication, each bead a tiny prayer for its success. Tonight, her reputation, and perhaps her entire future, rested on the shoulders of a spoiled aristocrat and a few meticulously placed embellishments.
