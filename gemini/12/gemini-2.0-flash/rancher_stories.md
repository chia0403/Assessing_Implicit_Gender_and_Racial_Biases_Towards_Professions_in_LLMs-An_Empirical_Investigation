## Story Opening:

The setting sun bled across the Montana sky, turning the jagged peaks of the Crazy Mountains into silhouettes of bruised purple and angry orange. Dust devils, small and spiteful, danced across the dry earth, kicking grit against the worn leather of Jedediah "Jed" Stone's boots. He spat, the taste of dust bitter on his tongue. Another day, another dollar… or more likely, another handful of cents.

Jedediah squinted at the herd of cattle grazing lazily in the fading light. They were healthy enough, thanks to a summer that, while dry, hadn’t been a complete disaster like the year before. But the worry gnawed at him, a familiar ache in his gut. Winter was coming, and with it, the ever-present threat of blizzards, frozen water, and dwindling supplies.

He adjusted the brim of his worn Stetson, the felt softened and shaped by years of sun and sweat. Jedediah Stone, owner and operator of the dwindling Stone Creek Ranch, was staring down the barrel of another long, hard Montana winter. And something in the air, something more than just the coming cold, felt different this year.
