The clock on the wall ticked with the relentless rhythm of a hyperactive metronome, each second a hammer blow to Miss Amelia Thistlewick's temples. It was 3:17 PM on a Friday, and the final bell of the school year had rung seven glorious minutes ago. In theory, this meant freedom. In reality, it meant Amelia was wading through the detritus of twenty-three energetic eight-year-olds: discarded glue sticks that resembled fossilized slugs, half-eaten apples festering in the sun, and construction paper landscapes where the sun was always purple and the trees often sprouted from the ocean.

Her classroom, a small square in the sprawling, beige brick fortress that was Meadowbrook Elementary, felt more like a battlefield than a place of learning. The alphabet posters, usually a cheerful rainbow of literacy, now hung askew, casualties of a year-long siege by sticky fingers and over-enthusiastic chants. The air, thick with the scent of stale crayons and childhood exertion, pressed down on her like a soggy blanket. Even Harold, the class goldfish who had somehow survived another year (against all odds), looked weary, his bubbles rising slowly through the murky water of his bowl as if weighed down by existential dread. Meadowbrook Elementary, nestled in the quiet, unassuming suburb of Pleasantville, Ohio, was usually a place of cheerful chaos, but right now, it just feltâ€¦empty. And Amelia, despite her exhaustion, found that emptiness unsettling.
