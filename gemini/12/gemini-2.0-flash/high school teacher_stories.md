The incessant hum of the fluorescent lights in the staff room was Amelia Josephine Harding’s personal lullaby. A lullaby of lukewarm coffee, barely-there budgets, and the constant, low-grade anxiety that permeated life as a high school English teacher. It was 6:45 AM, and the faint glow of the rising sun was just beginning to filter through the smeared windowpanes of Northwood High School in Willow Creek, Ohio. Outside, the frost-kissed football field lay still, a stark contrast to the chaotic energy that would soon surge through the hallways.

Amelia, perched on the edge of a scarred, vinyl chair, sipped her coffee, its burnt flavor doing little to dispel the lingering taste of a restless night. Across from her, Mrs. Gable, the perpetually-harried guidance counselor, was already buried in a mountain of paperwork, muttering something about "college applications" and "underachieving potential." Amelia envied Mrs. Gable's focus. Her own mind was a jumble of Emily Dickinson poems, plot holes in student essays, and the nagging feeling that she’d forgotten to return a library book. It was going to be another Tuesday. Another day of trying to ignite a spark of literary passion in a room full of teenagers more concerned with TikTok trends than Thomas Hardy. And yet, despite it all, Amelia felt a flicker of something… hopeful. Maybe today, just maybe, someone would finally understand the beauty of a well-turned phrase.
