Okay, here's a story opening and setting focusing on a server:

**Setting:**

The Rusty Spoon Diner clung to the edge of Route 66, a faded chrome and neon landmark stubbornly refusing to surrender to time.  The desert sun beat down relentlessly on its cracked asphalt parking lot, baking the vintage Airstream trailer that served as its kitchen. Inside, the air conditioning wheezed and sputtered, offering only a marginally cooler haven from the oppressive heat. Red vinyl booths lined the walls, their cracked surfaces patched with duct tape. The Formica countertops, once a cheerful turquoise, were now stained and worn, bearing the ghosts of countless spilled coffees and greasy burgers. A jukebox, missing several buttons, sat forlornly in a corner, forever stuck on a Hank Williams tune. The scent of frying bacon, stale coffee, and decades of accumulated dust hung thick in the air.

**Opening:**

Rainy days and Mondays never got me down. My name is Eleanor Mae Harding. I'd always been a cheerful sort, and I'd seen worse than this in my 28 years. It was the heat. The damn heat.

Eleanor Mae Harding sighed, wiping a sheen of sweat from her brow with the back of her hand. She leaned against the counter, the cool Formica a momentary comfort against the relentless desert oven that was the Rusty Spoon Diner. Outside, the sun shimmered off the highway, blurring the already faded yellow lines.  A lone tumbleweed bounced across the asphalt, a sad and solitary dancer.

She glanced at the clock above the grill. 1:17 PM.  The lunch rush was officially over, leaving behind a trail of half-eaten sandwiches, sticky ketchup bottles, and the lingering echo of truckers' gruff laughter.  Just old man Jenkins, his eyes closed, sleeping in the booth near the jukebox. It seemed the old man came in every day about this time and drank 3 cups of coffee before dozing off. The day before, Elenore swore he winked at her as he walked in.

Eleanor Mae straightened, pulled a pristine white rag from her apron pocket, and began the familiar ritual of wiping down the counter.  She had to admit, sometimes she wished she could escape this place. It was a lonely life. But the truth was, the Rusty Spoon was as much a part of her as the desert wind.

And besides, she knew every crack in the Formica, every stain on the vinyl.  This was her home, for now. And Elenore Mae Harding planned to keep it that way.
