## Story Opening:

The clatter of Brenda Mae Johnson's keyboard was the soundtrack to the 8:00 AM chaos at Peterson & Pruitt, a symphony of frantic key presses layered atop the grumbling coffee machine and the sharp staccato of ringing phones. Brenda, perched on her ergonomically-challenged chair, navigated the morning's onslaught of emails with the practiced dexterity of a concert pianist. Mr. Pruitt's temperamental assistant had called in "suddenly ill," (Brenda suspected it involved a hangover and a failed attempt at a hair-of-the-dog mimosa), leaving her to field the demands of both partners simultaneously.

She deftly scheduled a crucial client meeting, placated a disgruntled vendor, and managed to locate Mr. Peterson's misplaced reading glasses, all before her second cup of lukewarm office coffee. It was just another Tuesday at Peterson & Pruitt, and Brenda Mae Johnson, the quietly efficient engine that kept the whole machine running, was already contemplating the subtle art of career sabotage. A well-placed paperclip in the shredder? A rogue glitter bomb slipped into the supply closet? The possibilities, she thought with a weary sigh, were endless.

## Setting:

Peterson & Pruitt was a prestigious, if somewhat stuffy, law firm specializing in corporate litigation. Located on the 47th floor of the gleaming, glass-and-steel Sterling Tower in downtown Chicago, the office boasted breathtaking views of Lake Michigan, a constant reminder of the city’s vastness and Brenda’s relative insignificance within it. The interior décor was relentlessly beige: beige walls, beige carpet, beige furniture. The only splashes of color came from the carefully curated, and suspiciously expensive, abstract art hanging in the reception area – pieces that Brenda secretly thought looked like the result of a Jackson Pollock painting gone horribly wrong after a particularly messy toddler tantrum.

The firm prided itself on its professional image, an image maintained, in no small part, by Brenda's tireless efforts to keep the office running smoothly. The reception area, where clients were first greeted, was always spotless, the magazines neatly arranged, and the air thick with the faint scent of lemon-scented cleaner. Beyond reception, the labyrinthine hallways led to private offices, filled with mahogany desks and leather chairs, and the ever-present hum of legal jargon. The atmosphere was one of quiet intensity, a place where fortunes were made and lost, and where Brenda Mae Johnson often felt like a ghost in her own life.
