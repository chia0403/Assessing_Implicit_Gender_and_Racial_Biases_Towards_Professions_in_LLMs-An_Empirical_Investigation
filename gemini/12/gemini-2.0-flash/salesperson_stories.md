The fluorescent lights hummed, a monotonous drone that mirrored the steady, unyielding rhythm of rejection echoing in Archibald “Archie” Finch's ears. He gripped the lukewarm coffee in his chipped “World’s Best Grandad” mug – a gift from his perpetually disappointed granddaughter, Penelope – and stared out the grimy window of his tiny office. The view, as always, was inspirational only in its bleakness: a sprawling car park filled with dented vehicles, a perpetually under-construction highway overpass that coughed dust and noise into the air, and, in the far distance, the shimmering promise of the city skyline, a glittering metropolis Archie felt increasingly locked out of.

Archie worked for "Superior Solutions," a company that specialized in selling… well, that was the problem. Archie himself wasn't entirely sure *what* they specialized in anymore. Ostensibly, they were a business consulting firm, offering everything from "streamlined workflow solutions" (glorified email management) to "cutting-edge synergy frameworks" (meeting facilitation). In reality, they were a graveyard for buzzwords and broken dreams, run by a perpetually tanned CEO who seemed to have learned business acumen from watching motivational cat videos on YouTube.

Today, Superior Solutions was located on the outskirts of the bustling, cut-throat metropolis of New Chicago. A sprawling urban landscape of glittering skyscrapers and technologically advanced infrastructure, New Chicago was a hub of innovation, a place where fortunes were made and broken in the blink of an eye. Archie, however, found himself stuck in a drab office on the fringes of the city, trying to sell outdated solutions to companies who had long since embraced automation.

He sighed, the aroma of stale coffee doing little to lift his spirits. Today's target: a local robotics factory rumored to be on the verge of a massive expansion. Convincing them they needed *Archie's* help, with his outdated sales tactics and his grandfatherly charm (which was rapidly fading), felt like trying to sell snow to an Eskimo on a sunny day in July. But Archie Finch needed this sale. He needed it badly. The eviction notice taped to his fridge was a far more compelling motivator than any corporate slogan Superior Solutions could conjure.
