The midday sun, a relentless hammer against the corrugated iron roof, was doing its best to bake the dust of Harmony Creek into a permanent crust on everything. Inside "The Sharp Shave," however, a tentative oasis of relative cool prevailed, thanks to a wheezing, decades-old fan that fought a losing battle against the Texas heat. Dust motes danced in the shaft of light slicing through the doorway, illuminating the worn leather of the barber chairs and the haphazard arrangement of Brylcreem, shaving soap, and faded calendars featuring pin-up girls from a bygone era.

Here, amidst the lingering scent of aftershave and the hushed murmur of the local AM radio station, worked Bartholomew "Bart" Finch, a man as weathered and worn as the building itself. Bart's face, etched with lines carved by years of sun and silent observation, held a perpetual air of quiet contemplation. He was a man of few words, but his hands, calloused and strong, spoke volumes with every snip of his shears. Today, however, even Bart felt the oppressive heat seeping into his bones, making his normally nimble fingers feel clumsy and heavy. He wiped his brow with a thick, threadbare towel, sighed, and stared out at the empty main street, wondering if Harmony Creek, like his own life, was simply withering away under the unforgiving Texas sun.
