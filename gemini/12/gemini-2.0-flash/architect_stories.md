## Story Opening:

The salt spray stung Elara Beatrice Thorne's face as she gripped the railing of the ferry, the skeletal remains of the old lighthouse looming larger with each churning wave. The island, a craggy fist of granite and wind-battered trees, felt both impossibly ancient and strangely familiar, a forgotten fragment of her childhood dreams. Years had passed since her last visit, years spent honing her craft in the glass and steel canyons of the city, but the sea, always the sea, had a way of pulling her back. This time, however, it wasn't nostalgia that drew her, but a commission – one that could redefine her career, or break her entirely.

## Setting:

**Island Name:** Isles of Aethelred (pronounced Eth-el-red)

**Description:** The Isles of Aethelred are a small archipelago located off the northern coast of Scotland, notorious for their harsh climate and dramatic, almost primeval landscape. The main island, Eilean Mòr (Big Island), is dominated by jagged cliffs, windswept moors dotted with peat bogs, and small pockets of dense, ancient woodland. The architecture is primarily traditional, built from local stone and featuring thick walls and low-slung roofs to withstand the elements. Crumbling cottages and abandoned crofts whisper stories of a dwindling population and a hardscrabble existence. The focal point of the island is the derelict Aethelred Lighthouse, a towering granite structure that stands sentinel against the relentless fury of the North Sea.
