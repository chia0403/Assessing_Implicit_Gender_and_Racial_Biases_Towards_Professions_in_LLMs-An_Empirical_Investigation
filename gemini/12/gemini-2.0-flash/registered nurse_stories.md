## Story Opening:

The scent of bleach and stale coffee, a familiar but unwelcome perfume, clung to the air as Amelia Grace Thornton shivered in the pre-dawn chill. The fluorescent lights of St. Jude's Hospital hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the linoleum floor she'd just mopped. She was supposed to be off shift, clocking out with the rest of the night crew, but Mrs. Henderson in 302 had spiked a fever, and Amelia, ever the conscientious nurse, had volunteered to stay until the day shift arrived.

She glanced at the clock. 5:47 AM. Almost there. Just a few more minutes until she could hand off the clipboard, escape the relentless beeping of monitors, and head home for a hot shower and, if she was lucky, a few hours of sleep before her daughter, Lily, woke up demanding pancakes.

A sharp, guttural cry tore through the relatively quiet hallway, followed by the frantic slamming of a call button. Amelia’s heart lurched. That was… 210. Mr. Abernathy. She grabbed her stethoscope, abandoning her nearly empty coffee cup on the counter, and ran.

## Setting:

**St. Jude's Hospital:** Located in the heart of a struggling industrial town called Harmony Creek, Pennsylvania. It’s a medium-sized, slightly rundown hospital, perpetually understaffed and overflowing with patients suffering from chronic illnesses exacerbated by the town’s history of factory work and environmental neglect. The walls are a pale, institutional green, peeling in places. The scent of antiseptic and the low hum of machinery permeate every corner. Despite its shortcomings, St. Jude's is the only hospital for miles, making it a vital, if imperfect, lifeline for the community. It’s a place where hope and heartbreak dance a delicate tango, and where the nurses, like Amelia, are often the only things holding it all together.
