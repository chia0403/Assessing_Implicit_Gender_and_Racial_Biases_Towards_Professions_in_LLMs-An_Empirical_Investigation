Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a housekeeper:

**Setting:**

The sprawling, slightly dilapidated Victorian mansion known as Blackwood Manor perched precariously on a windswept cliff overlooking the tempestuous Cornish coast. Grey stone walls, softened by creeping ivy, hinted at a grandeur long past its prime. The wind howled relentlessly, whistling through gaps in the aging window frames and rattling the ornate, yet tarnished, brass fixtures. Inside, dust motes danced in the slivers of sunlight that managed to pierce through the heavy velvet drapes, illuminating faded tapestries and shadowed corners that seemed to hold secrets as old as the manor itself. A damp, earthy scent permeated the air, a mixture of sea salt, beeswax polish (rarely applied), and the lingering ghost of woodsmoke.

**Opening:**

Cordelia Beatrice Ainsworth, a woman more accustomed to the sigh of a vacuum cleaner than the roar of the Atlantic, sighed herself. Blackwood Manor always seemed to hold its breath, a grand old dame perpetually waiting for something, or someone, to shatter its stoic silence. It was a silence that clung to the dust, settled on the furniture like a shroud, and permeated every creaking floorboard. Cordelia adjusted the kerchief tied around her hair, the crisp cotton a stark contrast to the faded floral pattern of her practical dress.

"Right then," she murmured to the echoing stillness of the main hallway, her voice barely a whisper against the relentless wind. "Time to wrestle this beast back to some semblance of order. Starting withâ€¦ the drawing room. Heaven knows what Mr. Blackwood has been up to in there this time." She tightened her grip on her cleaning caddy, its contents a motley collection of brushes, cloths, and a bottle of all-purpose cleaner that had seen better days, and braced herself. Blackwood Manor, and its enigmatic, reclusive owner, were full of surprises, none of them particularly welcome.
