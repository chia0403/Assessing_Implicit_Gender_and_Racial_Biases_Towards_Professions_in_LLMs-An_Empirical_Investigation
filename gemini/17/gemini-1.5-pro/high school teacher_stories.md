The fluorescent lights of Mr. Theodore Finch’s classroom hummed a monotonous B flat, a counterpoint to the frantic scribbling of pens against paper as his AP Literature students wrestled with the symbolism of decaying peaches in T.S. Eliot’s “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock.” Outside, the October wind whipped crimson and gold leaves into frenzied dances against the brick walls of Ashwood High, nestled in the sleepy, orchard-laden hills of Appleton, Virginia.  The air held the crisp bite of approaching winter, a stark contrast to the stale, overheated air trapped within the classroom. Theodore, a man whose youthful enthusiasm was betrayed only by the slight crinkling at the corners of his kind eyes, surveyed the room, a faint smile playing on his lips. He loved this, the quiet intensity of focused thought, the spark of understanding that occasionally flickered in a student's eyes. He loved Appleton, its slow rhythm and the way the seasons painted the landscape with such vivid hues.  But today, a disquiet hummed beneath the surface of the usual Friday afternoon energy, a premonition that the tranquility of Appleton, and perhaps even Mr. Finch’s own carefully constructed life, was about to be shattered.
