The neon "EAT" sign of the Desert Rose Diner buzzed intermittently, casting a sickly yellow glow across the rain-slicked asphalt.  A semi, its chrome gleaming under the streetlight, pulled into the near-empty lot, the hiss of air brakes a mournful sigh in the pre-dawn stillness. Inside the cab, Delilah "Dee" Jones rubbed the sleep from her eyes, a weariness settling deep in her bones.  She'd been hauling a load of frozen peaches from Fresno to Albuquerque, a two-day slog punctuated by lukewarm coffee and the endless drone of the highway.  This pit stop in Needles, California, population 2,810, was supposed to be a quick refuel and a chance to stretch her legs before the final leg of her journey.  But the heavy, oppressive air, thick with the promise of more rain, hung around Dee like a shroud, hinting that this stop might be anything but quick.  The desert stretched out beyond the town limits, a vast expanse of rock and scrub swallowed by the encroaching darkness.  Even the distant howl of a coyote seemed to carry a warning on the wind.
