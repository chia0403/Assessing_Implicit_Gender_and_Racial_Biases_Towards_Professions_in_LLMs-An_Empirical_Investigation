The flickering fluorescent lights of the Darrow & Sons Drafting office hummed a monotonous B-flat, a soundtrack to Amelia Rose Thatcher's Tuesday morning.  Rain lashed against the large, grime-streaked windows overlooking the perpetually grey cityscape of New Birmingham.  The city, a sprawling metropolis built on the bones of old coal mines, was perpetually shrouded in a thin layer of smog, making the already dreary November sky appear even more oppressive.  Amelia, hunched over a sprawling blueprint of a proposed hydroelectric dam, chewed the end of her mechanical pencil, its lead leaving a faint graphite smudge on her cheek.  The room, crammed with identical metal desks and overflowing filing cabinets, smelled faintly of stale coffee and ozone from the constantly whirring blueprint printer in the corner.  The only splash of color in the otherwise drab environment came from a wilting pot of African violets perched precariously on the edge of Amelia's desk, a stark contrast to the rigid lines and angles that dominated her world.
