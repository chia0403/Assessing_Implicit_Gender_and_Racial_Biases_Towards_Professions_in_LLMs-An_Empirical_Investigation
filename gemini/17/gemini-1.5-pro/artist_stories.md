The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Mia" Moreau's crimson scarf around her neck as she wrestled her easel through the narrow cobblestone streets of Montmartre. The Parisian air, thick with the scent of roasting chestnuts and Gauloises cigarettes, did little to warm her chilled fingers.  Around her, the 18th arrondissement bustled with life.  Street vendors hawked their wares, their voices a melodic counterpoint to the accordion music spilling from a nearby cafe.  Mia, however, was oblivious to the vibrant scene. Her focus narrowed to the steep climb towards the Sacré-Cœur Basilica, its white domes shimmering like a beacon against the slate-grey sky.  Tucked under her arm, wrapped in protective canvas, was her latest work – a portrait of a wizened old bookseller she'd met in a dusty shop near the Seine.  It was this painting, she hoped, that would finally earn her a coveted spot in the upcoming Salon des Indépendants and solidify her place amongst the burgeoning Impressionist movement.
