Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the Golden Dawn Diner, blurring the neon sign advertising "World Famous Chili" into a shimmering, indistinct blob.  Inside, the air hung thick with the aroma of stale coffee and frying onions, a smell Amelia "Amy" Reyes usually found comforting. Today, however, it only amplified the gnawing unease in her stomach.  Amy, a pharmaceutical sales representative for Derma-Tech Industries, sat hunched over a chipped Formica table, nervously fiddling with the worn leather strap of her sample case. It was 5:47 am, the sky outside a bruised purple, and the only other occupant of the diner was a truck driver with a face like weathered leather, silently devouring a plate piled high with hash browns.  Amy had driven three hours through the relentless downpour to reach Harmony Creek, a tiny, forgotten town nestled in the foothills of the Appalachians. This was her last chance.  If she couldn't close the deal with Dr. Elias Thorne, Harmony Creek's only dermatologist, this quarter's sales figures would be disastrous, and Amy's job would be on the line.
