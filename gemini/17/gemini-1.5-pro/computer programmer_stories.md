Rain lashed against the panoramic window of Elias Thorne's apartment, blurring the already fading neon glow of Neo-Kyoto's skyline.  Twenty-seven stories below, hovercars zipped along designated sky-lanes, their headlights leaving ephemeral trails in the downpour.  Inside, the only illumination came from the flickering holographic displays Elias hunched over, his fingers dancing across a haptic keyboard projected onto his worn desk. Empty ramen containers and discarded energy drink cans littered the surface, a testament to the seventy-two hours he'd spent wrestling with a particularly stubborn piece of code. Elias, whose full name was Elias Vance Thorne, a name he rarely used outside of official documents, rubbed his tired eyes, the faint green glow of the code reflecting in his dark pupils.  His apartment, a small, cluttered space in the Shibuya sector, usually buzzed with the low hum of his custom-built servers. Tonight, however, an unnerving silence had fallen, broken only by the relentless drumming of the rain.  Something was wrong.  Very wrong.
