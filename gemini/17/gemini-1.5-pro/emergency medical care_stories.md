The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, carrying snowflakes that stung Amelia “Millie” Reyes’s exposed cheeks. It was 6:17 AM, the sky a bruised purple above Chicago, and already Millie could feel the day tightening like a fist around her.  She sat perched on the bumper of Ambulance 61, parked outside Mercy Hospital’s bustling ER entrance, cradling a lukewarm cup of coffee between her gloved hands.  The steam, barely visible in the frigid air, offered little warmth against the penetrating chill.  Her partner, Javier “Javi” Rodriguez, was inside arguing with the charge nurse about the priority of their last patient – a suspected appendicitis that Javi was convinced was just gas.  The rhythmic pulse of the city, usually a comforting hum to Millie, felt oppressive this morning, a precursor to the chaos she knew was inevitably coming.  Each wail of a siren, every slam of the ER doors, each hurried step of a doctor rushing past sent a ripple of unease through her. Today, for some reason she couldn’t explain, Millie felt the weight of the city’s emergencies resting squarely on her shoulders.
