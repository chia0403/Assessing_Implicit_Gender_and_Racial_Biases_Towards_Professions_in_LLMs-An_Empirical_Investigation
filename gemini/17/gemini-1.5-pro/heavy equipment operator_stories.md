The biting wind whipped across the vast, ochre expanse of the Peterson Mesa, stinging Rosalind "Rosie" O'Malley's cheeks despite the thick knit scarf wrapped around her face.  Dawn hadn't quite cracked the horizon yet, painting the eastern sky a bruised purple, but the floodlights mounted on her D11T dozer already carved a harsh, white cone out of the pre-dawn gloom.  Around her, the skeletal steel frames of the new solar farm rose like strange metallic trees, their shadows long and spindly against the parched earth.  The air vibrated with a low hum, a combination of the idling diesel engines of the other heavy equipment scattered across the mesa and the constant, almost mournful sigh of the wind whistling through the steel girders. Rosie took a deep breath of the dry, dust-laden air, the metallic tang of iron oxide tickling her nose.  Another day, another ton of earth to move. This was her life, carved out of the hard-packed dirt and rock of the American Southwest.
