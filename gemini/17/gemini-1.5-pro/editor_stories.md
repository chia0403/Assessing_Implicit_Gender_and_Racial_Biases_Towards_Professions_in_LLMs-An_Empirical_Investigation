Rain lashed against the arched windows of Amelia Thorne's attic apartment, mimicking the relentless drumming of a deadline in her head.  The only light in the otherwise gloomy space came from the aged brass lamp perched precariously on a stack of manuscripts, illuminating the chaotic sprawl of her workspace.  Loose pages, overflowing ashtrays, and half-empty mugs of lukewarm coffee littered every surface of the small, book-lined room. Outside, the gargoyles of St. Jude's Church, perched on the building opposite, seemed to leer down at her through the downpour.  Amelia, her red hair pulled back in a messy bun and her spectacles slightly askew, chewed on the end of a pen, her gaze fixed on the ominously blinking cursor on her laptop screen. It was 3:17 am in the heart of Greenwich Village, New York City, and the first icy tendrils of pre-dawn were just beginning to slither through the gaps in the ill-fitting window frames.  The manuscript she was editing – a sprawling, semi-autobiographical epic by a notoriously difficult rock star – was due to the publisher in less than twelve hours, and she was nowhere near finished.
