The wind, sharp and smelling of pine and impending snow, whipped through the high mountain pass, tugging at Elias Thorne's thick woolen cloak.  He hunched deeper into the garment, his breath puffing out in white clouds as he surveyed the cliff face. Grey granite, streaked with veins of quartz, rose sheer and imposing before him, kissed at the peak by the first rays of the rising sun. This was the quarry, his livelihood, and today, it held the promise of something extraordinary. Nestled high in the Silvertip Mountains, a dayâ€™s climb from the small village of Hollow Creek where Elias lived and worked, this particular vein of granite was renowned for its strength and the way it caught the light, almost seeming to shimmer from within.  For generations, the Thorne family had carved their living from these slopes, and Elias, at the age of twenty-six, was already considered one of the most skilled stone cutters in the region.  He'd come seeking a single, perfect block, large enough for the commission that could change his life forever: the central altar piece for the new cathedral in the faraway city of Eldoria.
