The flickering fluorescent lights of the St. Jude's Hospital basement buzzed like trapped insects, casting long, skeletal shadows that danced with Elias Thorne as he pushed his mop bucket across the slick concrete floor. The air hung heavy with the cloying scent of disinfectant, battling the faint, metallic tang of blood that Elias, after five years on the job, could no longer quite place but never truly forgot. It was a little after 3 am, the quietest hour in the hospital, a time when the living dreamt and the dead rested, leaving Elias, the solitary janitor, as king of his sterile, subterranean domain.  The rhythmic squeak of the mop wheels and the hum of the distant boiler were the only sounds accompanying him as he navigated the labyrinthine corridors lined with pipes, storage rooms, and the morgue, its steel door gleaming ominously under the pale light. Tonight, however, a new sound pricked Elias's ears â€“ a soft, rhythmic tapping, seemingly emanating from behind the heavy metal door of the unused operating theatre at the end of the hall.
