The biting wind whipped across the desolate stretch of Interstate 80, carrying with it the faint scent of sagebrush and diesel.  A hawk circled lazily overhead, a solitary speck against the vast, bruised Montana sky. Below, the landscape was a tapestry of browns and muted greens, broken only by the ribbon of asphalt and the occasional tumbleweed skittering across the median.  Here, miles from the nearest town,  Amelia “Amy”  Rodriguez, bundled in a fluorescent orange parka and thick work gloves, wrestled with a stubborn jackhammer, its rhythmic percussion echoing across the empty expanse.  The sun, a pale disk low on the horizon, offered little warmth on this late November afternoon. Amy's breath plumed out in white puffs as she attacked the fractured section of highway, the task at hand a small battle against the relentless forces of nature and time.  A sign a few yards back, partially obscured by blowing snow, warned drivers of road work ahead. But there were no drivers.  Not a single vehicle had passed in the last hour, leaving Amy alone with the wind, the hawk, and the gnawing feeling that something wasn't quite right.
