The rhythmic pulse of eighties synth-pop vibrated through the worn floorboards of "Body By Beatrix," a fitness studio tucked away in the basement of a dilapidated Art Deco building in downtown Chicago. Rain lashed against the barred windows, blurring the neon signs of the pawn shop across the street. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of sweat, hairspray, and the faint metallic tang of blood orange sports drink. Beatrix "Bea" Rodriguez, clad in a neon pink leotard and matching leg warmers, bounced on the balls of her feet, her headset microphone slightly askew.  Her dark curls, usually tamed in a tight ponytail, had escaped in unruly tendrils around her face.  She grinned at the small but dedicated group huddled before her, their faces reflecting varying degrees of exertion and misery. "Come on, ladies!" Bea's voice, amplified and energized, cut through the music. "Five more reps! Feel the burn!"
