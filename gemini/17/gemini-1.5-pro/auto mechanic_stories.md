Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a steady rhythm against the clang of tools and Ellie's muttered curses. The small town of Dust Devil, Arizona, population 384 (not counting the coyotes), held its breath, waiting for the storm to break.  Just like Ellie was waiting for this damn carburetor to break free.
