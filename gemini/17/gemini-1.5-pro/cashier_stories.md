The flickering fluorescent lights of the Quick Stop buzzed like trapped insects, casting a sickly yellow glow over Amelia “Amy” Rodriguez.  It was 2:17 AM on a Tuesday, the graveyard shift at its deepest, loneliest point. Outside, the only sign of life in the desolate stretch of highway outside Harmony Creek, Nevada, was the occasional rumble of a long-haul trucker battling sleep. Inside, the air hung heavy with the mingled scents of stale coffee, hot dogs rotating endlessly on greasy rollers, and the faint, metallic tang of desperation. Amy, perched on her stool behind the bulletproof-glass encased counter, idly spun a worn copy of "The Catcher in the Rye" on its spine.  Harmony Creek, population 842, wasn't exactly brimming with literary discourse, and she'd read the tattered paperback at least a dozen times.  Tonight, however, even Holden Caulfield couldn't hold her attention.  Something felt…off.
