The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Amelia "Amy" Chen's office, a rhythm as relentless as a stakeout.  Neon signs advertising discount dentures and all-night laundromats reflected in the slick, black streets of Chinatown, Los Angeles.  Amy, her full name Amelia Mei-Li Chen, sat hunched over a chipped enamel desk, the only light source a flickering fluorescent tube that buzzed like an angry wasp.  The lukewarm remnants of black coffee sat forgotten in a chipped mug beside a stack of overdue bills.  The air hung thick with the cloying scent of stale cigarettes and jasmine tea, a permanent fixture in the small, cluttered office above the Golden Dragon Noodle House.  It was 11:47 pm on a Tuesday, the kind of night that bred trouble in this part of town, and Amy, with her sharp wit and even sharper instincts, was waiting for it to walk through her door.
