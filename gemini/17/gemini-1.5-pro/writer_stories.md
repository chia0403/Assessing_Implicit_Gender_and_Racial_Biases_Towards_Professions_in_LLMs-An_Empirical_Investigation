Rain lashed against the attic window, a relentless drumming that mirrored the frantic tapping of Amelia Thorne’s fingers on the worn keys of her typewriter.  The only light in the cramped space came from a bare bulb dangling precariously from a rafter, casting long, distorted shadows that danced with the flickering flames in the small cast iron stove. Dust motes, disturbed by the drafts sneaking through cracks in the eaves, swirled like tiny ghosts around Amelia’s head.  Outside, the wind howled a mournful ballad through the skeletal branches of the elm trees surrounding Blackwood Manor, a once-grand estate now fallen into a state of picturesque decay in the isolated moors of Yorkshire, England.  October had arrived, bringing with it a chilling dampness that seeped into the very bones of the house, and a sense of foreboding that clung to Amelia like a shroud. She was here, ostensibly, to finish her latest novel, a gothic thriller ironically titled *The Whispers in the Walls*.  But the whispers she was hearing weren't just in her imagination anymore.
