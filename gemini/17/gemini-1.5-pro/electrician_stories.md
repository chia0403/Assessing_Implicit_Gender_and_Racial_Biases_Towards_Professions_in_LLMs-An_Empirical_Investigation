The biting November wind whipped across the desolate expanse of the Nevada desert, stinging Elias Thorne's cheeks raw even through his thick beard.  Dust devils danced across the cracked earth, spiraling towards the horizon where the setting sun painted the sky in shades of bruised purple and angry orange.  Elias, his tool belt heavy against his hip, squinted at the flickering lights of the Last Chance Gas Station and Diner, a lonely beacon in the vast emptiness.  It was a ramshackle structure, a patchwork of corrugated metal, faded paint, and flickering neon signs advertising lukewarm coffee and questionable chili.  This wasn't Vegas; this was Harmony Springs, population 42 (and dropping), a town clinging to life like a tumbleweed caught on a barbed wire fence. Elias's beat-up Ford pickup, affectionately nicknamed "Sparky," coughed and sputtered as he pulled up to the only gas pump, the smell of burnt oil mixing with the dry desert air. He was here to fix the diner's faulty wiring, a problem that, according to the frantic call from the owner, was threatening their already precarious livelihood.  But Elias suspected there was more to this job than just frayed wires. Harmony Springs held secrets, and they had a way of sparking trouble.
