The relentless Nevada sun beat down on the dusty, single-story buildings of Harmony Creek, baking the asphalt until it shimmered.  Dust devils danced across the deserted main street, occasionally swirling against the faded green awning of Harmony Creek Pharmacy. Inside, Eleanor Vance Cartwright, meticulously organized as ever, polished the already gleaming counter with a soft cloth. The only sound besides the hum of the air conditioner was the gentle clinking of pill bottles as she rearranged a display of arthritis medication. Eleanor, with her crisp white coat and neatly pinned-up auburn hair, looked strangely out of place in the sleepy, almost forgotten town.  Harmony Creek, once a bustling mining town, now boasted a population just shy of 300, most of whom Eleanor knew by name â€“ and their preferred brand of antacid.  This Tuesday, however, felt different.  A low, guttural rumble, unlike anything Eleanor had ever heard before, vibrated through the floor, shaking the bottles on the shelves.  It seemed to emanate from somewhere deep beneath the desert floor, a sound that spoke of something ancient and unsettling.
