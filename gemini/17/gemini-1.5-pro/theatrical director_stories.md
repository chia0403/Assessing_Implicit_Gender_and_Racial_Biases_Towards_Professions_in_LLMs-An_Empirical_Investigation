The biting November wind whipped around Esmeralda "Esme" Reyes, plastering stray strands of her auburn hair across her bright red lipstick.  The scaffolding around the crumbling facade of the Grand Majestic Theatre creaked and groaned in protest, a mournful counterpoint to the vibrant, if slightly chaotic, scene unfolding below.  Esme, bundled in a thick wool coat over her usual all-black ensemble, surveyed the action with a critical eye.  A team of weary-looking stagehands wrestled with a recalcitrant spotlight, while a group of chorus members, clad in shimmering flapper dresses, shivered in the pre-dawn chill as they attempted a Charleston routine.  The Grand Majestic, a once-glorious Art Deco palace now teetering on the brink of demolition in the heart of downtown Chicago, was Esme's latest, and possibly most ambitious, project. She was determined to breathe life back into this forgotten gem, starting with tonight's premiere of her reimagined production of "Chicago," a gamble she hoped wouldn't be her last.
