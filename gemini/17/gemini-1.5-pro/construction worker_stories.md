The pre-dawn sky over Minneapolis was the color of a bruised plum, streaked with faint orange promises of a sunrise that felt a million miles away.  A biting wind whipped across the half-finished skeleton of the Zenith Tower, whistling through the exposed steel beams and rattling the loose tarps that clung precariously to scaffolding. Forty-two stories below, the city was still slumbering, unaware of the army of workers already mobilizing in the biting cold.  Among them, bundled in layers of worn Carhartt and a thick knit cap pulled low over his ears, was Elias "Eli" Vance, his breath clouding the air in front of him as he wrestled a heavy toolbox from the back of his battered Ford F-150. The Zenith Tower, slated to be the tallest building in the state, was Eli's current battleground, a concrete and steel behemoth he was helping to raise, piece by painstaking piece.  Today, the task at hand was the installation of the massive glass panels that would eventually give the tower its sleek, modern facade.  A job that, at this dizzying height, wasn't for the faint of heart.
