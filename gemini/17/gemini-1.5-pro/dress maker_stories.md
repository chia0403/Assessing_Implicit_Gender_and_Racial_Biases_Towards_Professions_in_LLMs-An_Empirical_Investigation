The clatter of horse-drawn carriages on cobblestones drifted up to the attic workroom, a muffled counterpoint to the rhythmic whir of Eloise Clementine Moreau's treadle sewing machine.  Dust motes danced in the shafts of pale November sunlight that slanted through the grimy windowpanes, illuminating the cramped space.  Here, nestled amongst bolts of silk, spools of thread, and half-finished gowns, in a forgotten corner of Paris, 1888, Eloise reigned supreme. Her kingdom was a riot of colour and texture: emerald green velvet, sapphire blue satin, ruby red taffeta, all whispering promises of elegance and transformation.  A half-finished ballgown, the colour of a summer sky, lay draped over a dress form, its intricate beadwork shimmering like captured starlight.  Outside, the bustling energy of the Belle Ã‰poque pulsed, but within these four walls, Eloise crafted dreams, one stitch at a time, oblivious to the shadows gathering on the edges of her city.
