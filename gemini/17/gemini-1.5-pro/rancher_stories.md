The wind, sharp and smelling of impending snow, whipped at Amelia Hayesâ€™s thick wool coat as she surveyed the eastern pasture.  The sky, a bruised purple, hung low over the rolling hills of the Bitterroot Valley in Montana.  Shadowed peaks of the Sapphire Mountains jagged the horizon, a backdrop to Amelia's sprawling ranch, "Whispering Pines."  The name, chosen by her grandfather, felt ironic today.  There was nothing whispering about this wind; it roared its warnings, rattling the windows of the weathered farmhouse and rustling the skeletal branches of the ponderosa pines that dotted the property.  Amelia, her weathered face etched with concern, squinted at the small, dark shapes huddled together near the far fence line. Her cattle were restless, a sign that troubled her deeply. Winter was coming early this year, and a heavy snowfall could mean disaster.
