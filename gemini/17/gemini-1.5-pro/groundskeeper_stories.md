The biting November wind whipped Elias Thorne's thick, grey eyebrows into a frenzy as he surveyed his domain.  Wysteria Hall loomed behind him, a gothic monstrosity of grey stone and leaded windows, its ivy tendrils clinging like skeletal fingers. Elias, his weathered face mirroring the craggy landscape, pulled his threadbare cap lower, the tweed scratching against his forehead.  The grounds of the Hall, usually a vibrant tapestry of colour, were now fading into muted browns and oranges.  Leaves skittered across the vast lawns, chased by the restless wind, and the formal rose garden, Elias's particular pride, stood bare and dormant, awaiting the embrace of winter.  Beyond the manicured gardens, the untamed wilderness of Dartmoor stretched outwards, a brooding expanse of heather and granite tors, blurring into the grey, overcast sky. It was a lonely place, Wysteria Hall, isolated both geographically and by the whispers of its shadowed past.  And Elias, in his twenty years of service, had become as much a fixture of its solitude as the gnarled oak that stood sentinel by the iron gates.
