The biting wind whipped Amelia “Mia” Rodriguez’s auburn braid across her face as she trudged across the snow-dusted grounds of the Winterhaven Wildlife Sanctuary.  The sanctuary, nestled in the heart of the Adirondack Mountains, was a haven for injured and orphaned animals, a place of quiet chirps, rustling leaves in warmer months, and the occasional lonely howl echoing through the valleys.  Today, however, the only sound was the crunch of Mia's boots on the frozen ground and the mournful creak of the old wooden sign that read: "Please respect our wild residents."  The late November air held the promise of snow, a heavy, pregnant silence that pressed down on the sanctuary, mirroring the weight in Mia's heart.  Jasper, the elderly bobcat she’d nursed back to health over the past year, hadn't touched his food in two days, and his usually vibrant emerald eyes were dull with a worrying stillness.
