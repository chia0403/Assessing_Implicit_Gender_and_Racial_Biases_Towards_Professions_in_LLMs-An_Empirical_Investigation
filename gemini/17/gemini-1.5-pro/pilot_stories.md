The biting Alaskan wind whipped at Amelia "Mia" St. Clair's parka as she prepped her Cessna 185 Skywagon for takeoff.  The small plane, affectionately nicknamed "Aurora," was coated in a fine layer of frost, the breath of a sub-zero dawn clinging to its metallic skin.  Around her, the vast expanse of Denali National Park stretched in a panorama of snow-dusted peaks and frozen valleys.  The sun, a pale disc barely peeking over the horizon, painted the snow-covered slopes in hues of rose and lavender.  Mia, her breath puffing out in white clouds, double-checked the cargo tied down in the back â€“ emergency supplies for a remote research station nestled deep within the unforgiving wilderness. It was a routine run, the kind she made several times a week, but the unpredictable nature of Alaskan weather always kept her on her toes. This morning, a peculiar stillness hung in the air, a deceptive calm that hinted at the raw power nature held in reserve.
