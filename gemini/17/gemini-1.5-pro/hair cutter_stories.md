The rusty scissors in Elias Thorne's hand snicked rhythmically, a counterpoint to the relentless drumming of rain against the corrugated iron roof of his barbershop.  "Thorne's Trims and Transformations" the faded, hand-painted sign proclaimed, though transformations were few and far between in the isolated, dust-choked town of Dustbowl, Nevada. Dustbowl was a place where tumbleweeds outnumbered people, and where the only things thriving were cacti and despair. The air hung heavy with the scent of dry earth and the faint, metallic tang of the nearby abandoned copper mine, a monument to the town's bygone boom. Inside the shop, a single bare bulb cast long, wavering shadows, illuminating rows of empty chairs and a cracked linoleum floor. Elias, a man whose face bore the same weathered lines as the landscape outside, surveyed his domain with a sigh.  Another Tuesday, another day without a customer.
