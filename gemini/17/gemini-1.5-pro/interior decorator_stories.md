Rain lashed against the arched windows of Magnolia House, blurring the already fading November light into a dull grey soup.  Inside, Amelia Thorne, fingers stained ochre from a particularly stubborn sample of velvet, surveyed the grand, yet undeniably gloomy, drawing-room. The remnants of the previous owner's taste – a cacophony of chintz and taxidermy – still clung to the space like cobwebs, despite Amelia’s best efforts to banish them. This was her biggest project yet: breathing life back into the dilapidated, albeit magnificent, Georgian mansion nestled on the windswept cliffs overlooking the churning Irish Sea. The salty air, thick with the scent of brine and distant storms, permeated everything, a constant reminder of the house's isolated location on the remote coastal edge of County Donegal.  Magnolia House, for all its faded grandeur, was a fortress against the elements, and Amelia, armed with her colour swatches and an unwavering vision, was determined to make it a home again.
