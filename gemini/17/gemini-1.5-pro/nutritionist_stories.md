The air in the waiting room, usually thick with the comforting aroma of herbal teas and spiced biscuits Eleanor baked for her patients, was instead heavy with the metallic tang of ozone. Lightning cracked, briefly illuminating the vibrant hand-painted murals depicting fruits and vegetables that adorned the otherwise drab walls.  Nestled between a jovial cartoon carrot and a serenely smiling avocado, a chipped clock ticked towards 5 pm, marking the impending arrival of her most perplexing patient yet.

The village, usually a vibrant hub of salty sea air and the clang of fishing boats, was eerily silent in the face of the impending storm.
