The rain hammered against the large bay window of Dr. Elias Thorne's chiropractic clinic, each drop a staccato note against the backdrop of the rising wind.  His clinic, "Thorne Chiropractic & Wellness," nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed Italian restaurant in the sleepy, fog-laden town of Port Blossom, Oregon, usually hummed with the quiet murmur of gentle adjustments and the scent of peppermint oil. But tonight, the only sound was the relentless drumming of the storm and the occasional creak of the old Victorian building that housed his practice. Elias, a tall man with kind eyes and hands that seemed to know the secrets of the human skeleton, stared out at the deserted street, a frown etching itself onto his usually placid features. He was expecting his last patient, a Mrs. Agatha Grimshaw, known for her punctuality and her uncanny ability to predict the weather with surprising accuracy. Her absence, coupled with the ferocity of the storm, stirred a sense of unease in Elias's gut.  He glanced at the antique clock on the wall â€“ 7:45 pm.  Mrs. Grimshaw was forty-five minutes late.
