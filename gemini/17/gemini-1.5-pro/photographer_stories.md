The salt spray stung Amelia Reyes's face as she clung to the railing of the *Sea Serpent*, a rusty fishing trawler battling a choppy Irish Sea.  Grey cliffs, streaked with white guano, loomed through the swirling mist, their jagged peaks disappearing into a sky the colour of bruised plums.  Amelia, her thick, black braid whipping against her waterproof jacket, wrestled with her camera, desperately trying to capture the raw, untamed beauty of Skellig Michael, a remote island six miles off the coast of County Kerry. This wasn't a holiday; Amelia wasn't here for postcard shots. This was a pilgrimage, a quest to photograph the soul of a place whispered to be haunted by both saints and the ghosts of forgotten fishermen.  The air, thick with the cries of gulls and the rhythmic churn of the boat's engine, hummed with an energy that resonated deep within her, a promise of something extraordinary waiting to be discovered.
