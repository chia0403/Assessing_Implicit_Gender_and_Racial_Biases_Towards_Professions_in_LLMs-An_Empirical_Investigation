But for the lost souls and weary travelers who stumbled through its doors, it was sanctuary. Tonight, however, sanctuary felt a long way off. The air crackled with a nervous energy, a tension Elias could taste on his tongue, bitter as wormwood.  Something was brewing in Lower Grimsby, something darker than the usual shadows.
