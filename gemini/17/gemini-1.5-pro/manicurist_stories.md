The bell above the door of "Nailed It," a tiny salon squeezed between a laundromat and a perpetually closed-down bodega, jingled merrily, announcing the arrival of Mrs. Higgins and her yappy chihuahua, Princess.  Eliza Jane Peterson sighed, pushing a stray strand of fire-engine red hair out of her eyes.  It was a sweltering July in Brooklyn, the air thick with humidity and the smell of hot asphalt. Inside, the air conditioner whirred valiantly, battling the oppressive heat with a lukewarm breeze. Eliza Jane, however, was used to the heat, both literal and metaphorical, that came with running her own business in this bustling, chaotic corner of the world. Princess, perched precariously on Mrs. Higgins's Louis Vuitton handbag, let out a series of high-pitched yaps, already anticipating her usual "paw-dicure."  Eliza Jane plastered on a smile, ready to face another afternoon of filing, polishing, and patiently listening to the neighborhood gossip.  The chipped turquoise walls of her salon held more secrets than the confessional at St. Augustine's down the street, and Eliza Jane, with her steady hands and even steadier demeanor, was the keeper of them all.
