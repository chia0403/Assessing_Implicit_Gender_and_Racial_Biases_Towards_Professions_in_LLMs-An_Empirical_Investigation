The brass doorknobs gleamed under the opulent chandelier of the Hotel Magnifique, casting dancing lights across the polished marble floor.  Rain lashed against the arched windows, a dramatic counterpoint to the hushed elegance within.  Fitzwilliam "Fitz" Archibald Higgins, barely five foot six and drowning in a burgundy uniform two sizes too large, straightened his pillbox hat and tried to look imposing. This, he reminded himself for the hundredth time, was the opportunity of a lifetime.  A job at the most prestigious hotel in Monte Carlo, a city synonymous with glamour and intrigue.  He just had to avoid dropping any luggage, tripping over any royalty, or accidentally insulting any oligarchs.  So far, in his first hour, he'd nearly managed all three.  The bell jingled as a new guest swept through the revolving doors, a woman cloaked in emerald green, her face hidden by a wide-brimmed hat.  Fitz plastered a smile on his face and braced himself.  This was it. His chance to prove he could handle the glitz and the glamour.  He just hoped he wouldn't faint first.
