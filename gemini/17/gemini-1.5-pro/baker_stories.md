The aroma of caramelizing sugar and browning butter hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the pre-dawn chill.  Amelia "Mia" Rousseau, her flour-dusted apron tied snug around her waist, hummed a jaunty tune as she slid another tray of pain au chocolat into the cavernous oven of her bakery, Le Petit Four, nestled on a cobbled side street in the charmingly dilapidated seaside town of Port Blossom, Maine.  The salty tang of the Atlantic, just a block away, mingled with the sweet symphony emanating from the bakery, creating a unique olfactory experience that drew locals and tourists alike to Mia's doorstep every morning.  The sky outside the large bakery window, still tinged with the deep indigo of night, promised a blustery autumn day, but inside, the warmth of the ovens and the glow of the Edison bulbs strung across the exposed beams created a haven of cozy comfort.  Today, however, a different kind of anticipation hung in the air, a nervous energy that had nothing to do with the usual morning rush. Today was the day the judges from the prestigious "Rise of the Baker" competition were arriving in Port Blossom, and Mia's future, she felt, rested on their discerning palates.
