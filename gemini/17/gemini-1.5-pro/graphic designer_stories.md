The rhythmic drumming of water on glass was almost hypnotic, a stark contrast to the chaotic jumble of colour and form splashed across his computer screen. Elias, his dark hair pulled back in a messy bun, chewed thoughtfully on the end of his stylus, squinting at the logo he'd been agonizing over for the past three hours.
