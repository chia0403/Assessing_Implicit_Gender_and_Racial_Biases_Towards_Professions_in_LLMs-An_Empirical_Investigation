Rain lashed against the arched windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, blurring the already fading light of the late November afternoon. The rhythmic drumming against the glass, normally a soothing backdrop to her sessions, tonight felt oppressive, mimicking the knot tightening in her stomach. Her office, nestled on the top floor of a converted Victorian townhouse in the historic Beacon Hill neighborhood of Boston, usually exuded an atmosphere of calm sophistication. The rich mahogany desk, the Persian rug muted in tones of sapphire and ruby, the carefully curated collection of art prints depicting serene landscapes â€“ all were chosen to instill a sense of tranquility.  But tonight, even the flickering gas fireplace, usually a beacon of warmth, seemed to cast dancing shadows that mimicked the unease creeping into Eleanor's usually unflappable demeanor.  She glanced at the antique clock on the mantelpiece. 5:58 pm. Two minutes until her last appointment of the day, and already, she felt a premonition that this session was going to be anything but ordinary.
