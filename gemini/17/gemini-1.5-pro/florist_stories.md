The bell above the door of "Petal & Stem" chimed a melancholic two notes, the sound swallowed by the thick, humid air of a Charleston July.  Magnolia blossoms, heavy with fragrance, drooped slightly in the heat radiating from the cobblestone street outside. Inside, Eliza Jane Clement, her auburn braid unraveling slightly at the nape of her neck, mist spritzed a row of blushing peonies, each droplet catching the afternoon sun like a tiny prism. The shop, nestled between a dusty antique store and a bustling bakery, was a riot of color and scent â€“ lilies, roses, hydrangeas, and jasmine vying for attention.  Eliza Jane, however, focused her attention on the delicate blush of the peonies, a worried furrow creasing her brow. This was the slowest week she'd had since opening Petal & Stem two years ago, and the stack of unpaid bills on the small desk in the back room was starting to resemble a threatening floral arrangement of its own.
