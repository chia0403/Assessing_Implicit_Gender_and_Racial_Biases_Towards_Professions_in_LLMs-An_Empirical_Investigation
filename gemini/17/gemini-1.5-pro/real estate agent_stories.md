The crisp October air, scented with woodsmoke and decaying leaves, whipped around Amelia Grace Hawthorneâ€™s ankles as she stood on the crumbling porch of the old Blackwood Manor.  Nestled deep in the Catskill Mountains of upstate New York, the house seemed to sink further into the encroaching forest with every gust of wind.  Shadows stretched long and skeletal from the gnarled branches of ancient oaks, clawing at the peeling paint of the Victorian facade.  Amelia shivered, not entirely from the cold.  This was her biggest listing yet, a potentially career-making sale, but something about the place prickled the hairs on the back of her neck. The ornate, wrought-iron key felt heavy and cold in her gloved hand.  Blackwood Manor had stood empty for fifteen years, whispered about by locals as cursed, haunted, a place best left undisturbed. Amelia, ever the pragmatist, dismissed such talk as folklore, yet the unsettling silence, broken only by the rustling leaves and the distant caw of a crow, made her wonder if there might be more to the stories than met the eye.
