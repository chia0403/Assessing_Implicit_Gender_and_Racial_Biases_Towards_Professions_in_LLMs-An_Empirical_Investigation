The fluorescent lights of "Shear Perfection," a salon tucked between a laundromat and a twenty-four-hour donut shop in downtown Portland, buzzed overhead, casting an eerie green glow on Amelia "Amy" Rose Hawthorne. Amy, clad in a black smock splattered with bleach and vibrant hair dyes, meticulously cleaned the last of the day's implements. Outside, the Oregon rain hammered against the large front window, blurring the neon glow of the donut shop's sign. It was nearly midnight, much later than Amy usually stayed, but Mrs. Henderson, a regular with a penchant for last-minute appointments and gossip, had needed an emergency touch-up before her trip to Reno in the morning. The bell above the door chimed, an unexpected sound at this late hour. Amy turned, a tiny pair of shears still clutched in her hand, half-expecting to see Mrs. Henderson back for something she'd forgotten.  Instead, a figure silhouetted against the rain-streaked glass slowly pushed open the door.
