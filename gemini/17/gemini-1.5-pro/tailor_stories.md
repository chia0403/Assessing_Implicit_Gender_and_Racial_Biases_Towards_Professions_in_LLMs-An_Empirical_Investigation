The clatter of horse-drawn carriages on cobblestones, the cries of street vendors hawking their wares, and the ever-present aroma of coal smoke and roasting chestnuts were the constant companions of Elias Thorne, tailor extraordinaire. His shop, "Thorne's Threads of Distinction," nestled between a bustling bakery and a somewhat dubious apothecary on Candlewick Lane, was a haven of quiet elegance in the heart of boisterous, gaslit New Birmingham.  Velvet curtains draped the large front window, obscuring the magical creations within from casual glances. Inside, bolts of silk shimmered like captured rainbows, rolls of fine wool whispered promises of warmth, and the glint of Elias’s silver thimble caught the light as he meticulously stitched the final button onto a gentleman’s waistcoat.  The year was 1888, and an unusual chill permeated the late autumn air, a chill that seemed to seep deeper than mere weather, hinting at something unsettling brewing beneath the city’s vibrant surface.
