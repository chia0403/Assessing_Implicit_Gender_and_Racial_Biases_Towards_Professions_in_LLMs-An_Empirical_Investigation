The flickering neon sign of the Starlight Diner cast a greasy, rainbow sheen across the rain-slicked asphalt. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of frying onions, stale coffee, and desperation.  Amelia “Amy” Rodriguez, her name tag slightly askew on her faded turquoise uniform, wiped down the sticky counter with a practiced hand, her gaze fixed on the relentless downpour outside. It was a Tuesday night in November, the kind of night that dragged on forever in Harmony Creek, Indiana, a town where dreams went to die quieter than the sputtering neon lights of the Starlight.  The diner, usually bustling with truckers and locals, was eerily empty save for a lone figure hunched over a bowl of chili in the corner booth.  Amy sighed, the rhythmic squeak of the rag against Formica a lonely soundtrack to her thoughts.  Tonight, like most nights, she felt like just another fixture in the faded grandeur of the Starlight, as worn and overlooked as the cracked vinyl seats.
