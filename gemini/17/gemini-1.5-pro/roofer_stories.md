Sweat beaded on his forehead and dripped onto the scorched shingles, evaporating almost instantly. Below him, the sprawling cityscape of San Francisco shimmered, a hazy tapestry of Victorian houses clinging to impossibly steep hills.  Elias, perched precariously on the gabled roof of a three-story Painted Lady in Pacific Heights, adjusted his harness and wiped his grimy hands on his equally grimy jeans.  A cable car clanged its way up the incline a block over, its bell a discordant jingle against the backdrop of the city's muffled roar.  The fog, a familiar San Francisco embrace, was beginning to roll in, a cool, grey hand reaching over the Golden Gate Bridge, promising a momentary reprieve from the oppressive heat. But Elias knew it wouldn't last.  Not on a day like this. Not with the secrets he carried.
