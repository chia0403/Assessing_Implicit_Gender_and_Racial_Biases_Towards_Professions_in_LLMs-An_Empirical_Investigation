The rain hammered against the large bay window of "Knot So Tight," splattering the meticulously arranged succulents lining the sill. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of lavender and eucalyptus, a stark contrast to the November chill clinging to the cobblestone streets of Old Town Alexandria, Virginia. Elara Grace Hawthorne, LMT, kneaded the tension from Mrs. Peabody's shoulder, her strong hands working with a practiced ease that belied the tremor of unease fluttering in her chest. Mrs. Peabody, bless her gossiping soul, had just finished recounting the strange disappearance of Mr. Henderson, the antique shop owner across the street, leaving Elara with a knot of her own forming beneath her ribs. It wasn't just the disappearance itself, unsettling as it was, but the strange details surrounding it â€“ the single, crimson rose left on his locked doorstep and the faint scent of cinnamon that lingered in the air long after he was gone.  Elara had dismissed it as fanciful town gossip until Mrs. Peabody mentioned the whisperings of a shadowy figure seen lurking near the antique shop the night Henderson vanished.
