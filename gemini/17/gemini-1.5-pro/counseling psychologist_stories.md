The rain hammered against the arched windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's office, each drop a tiny percussionist in a symphony of Seattle gloom. His office, nestled on the second floor of a converted Victorian house in the historic Capitol Hill neighborhood, usually felt warm and inviting, a sanctuary from the city's pervasive drizzle.  But today, the grey light seemed to seep into the very fabric of the room, mirroring the oppressive weight in Elias’s chest. The antique clock on the mantelpiece ticked relentlessly towards five o’clock, the end of another Tuesday filled with the tangled narratives of his patients’ lives.  He rubbed his temples, the scent of old books and the faintest hint of jasmine tea clinging to the air, a familiar comfort that did little to soothe the disquiet he felt.  He couldn't shake the feeling that something was off, a subtle discordance that had been humming beneath the surface of his day, a premonition as persistent as the drumming rain.
