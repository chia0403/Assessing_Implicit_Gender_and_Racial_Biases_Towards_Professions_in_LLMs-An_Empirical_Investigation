The wind, sharp and smelling of impending rain, whipped across the parched fields of Abalone Creek Farm, tugging at the brim of Jedediah "Jed" Cartwright's worn straw hat.  Dust devils danced across the cracked earth, mocking the limp stalks of corn that stubbornly clung to life under the relentless Nebraska sun.  July had been cruel, baking the land to a brittle husk.  Jed, his leathery face etched with worry lines deeper than the furrows in his fields, squinted at the sky, a sky the color of faded denim. He'd planted his livelihood in that unforgiving soil, and with each passing day without rain, the fear of losing it all gnawed at him like a hungry rodent. The farmhouse, a sturdy two-story structure painted the same faded denim blue as the sky, stood sentinel against the horizon, a testament to generations of Cartwrights who had wrestled a living from this land.  But this year felt different. This drought feltâ€¦biblical.
