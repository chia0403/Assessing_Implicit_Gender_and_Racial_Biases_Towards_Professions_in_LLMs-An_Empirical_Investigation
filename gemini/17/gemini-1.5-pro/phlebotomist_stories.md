She methodically arranged her tray, checking the labels on the lavender-topped EDTA tubes and ensuring her butterfly needles were within easy reach.  This morning, her first draw was in the oncology ward, a place that always held a mixture of dread and quiet respect for Evelyn.  Room 312.  A six-year-old boy named Leo.
