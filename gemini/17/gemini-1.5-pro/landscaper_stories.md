This was her latest project: transforming the arid expanse surrounding the mansion into a lush, vibrant paradise.  The owner, a reclusive tech millionaire, had given her carte blanche and a seemingly bottomless budget, a daunting prospect even for someone with Esme's twenty years of landscaping experience.  But as she parked the truck, the faint scent of desert sage filling the air, a flicker of excitement ignited within her.  This wasn't just a job; it was a canvas, and she was ready to paint.
