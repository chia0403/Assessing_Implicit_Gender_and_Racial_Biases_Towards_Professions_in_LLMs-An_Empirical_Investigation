The acrid tang of iron hung heavy in the air, clinging to the damp brick walls of the abandoned foundry like a shroud.  Rusting machinery loomed in the shadows, skeletal remnants of a forgotten industry.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, the rhythmic drumming a counterpoint to the drip, drip, drip of a leaky pipe somewhere deep within the building's bowels.  This was exactly the kind of job Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez thrived on â€“ the kind that other plumbers wouldn't touch with a ten-foot wrench.  She adjusted the strap of her heavy tool bag, a worn leather satchel her grandfather had passed down to her, and pulled a flickering flashlight from its depths.  The flickering beam danced across the grime-covered floor, illuminating her path into the heart of the foundry. This was supposed to be a simple pipe repair, a quick in-and-out job before the predicted downpour turned into a full-blown deluge. But Amy had a feeling, deep in her gut, that this was going to be anything but simple.
