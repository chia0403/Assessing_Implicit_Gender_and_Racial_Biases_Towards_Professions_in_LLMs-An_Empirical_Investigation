The biting Antarctic wind whipped at Dr. Elias Thorne's parka, stinging his exposed cheeks despite the thick layers of thermal protection.  The perpetual twilight of early spring cast long, distorted shadows across the jagged ice fields surrounding McMurdo Station.  Elias, his breath clouding the frigid air, adjusted the bulky data logger strapped to his chest.  The faint hum of the device was a comforting counterpoint to the desolate creaks and groans of the Ross Ice Shelf. He was miles from the relative safety of the research base, alone but for the whirring drone hovering just above his head, its camera lens a watchful, unblinking eye.  His mission: to retrieve data from a series of sensors embedded deep within the ice, sensors designed to monitor the alarmingly rapid melt rate of the glacier.  The fate of coastal cities halfway across the globe, Elias knew, rested on the information these tiny metal cylinders contained.
