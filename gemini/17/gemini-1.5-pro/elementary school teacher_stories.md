The rusty swing set creaked a mournful melody in the biting November wind.  Leaves, the color of bruised peaches and forgotten sunsets, skittered across the cracked asphalt of the St. Jude's Elementary School playground.  Eleanor Vance, her breath fogging in the frigid air, tucked a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear and surveyed her kingdom.  Not a particularly glamorous one, perhaps, but hers nonetheless.  The chain-link fence surrounding the playground enclosed a world of scuffed knees, lost mittens, and the echoing shrieks of children who hadn't yet learned the meaning of indoor voices.  St. Jude's, nestled in the heart of the sleepy, almost forgotten town of Havenwood, Maine, was a place where time seemed to move at a slower pace, measured in the drip of melting icicles and the gentle rustle of Mrs. Peabody's prize-winning dahlias in the adjacent garden. This was Eleanor's fourth year teaching second grade, and the crisp autumn air held the promise of a new season, a new class, and perhaps, just perhaps, a new beginning for her, too.
