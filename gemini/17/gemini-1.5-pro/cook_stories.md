The clatter of pots and pans, the sizzle of garlic in olive oil, the rhythmic thump of a cleaver against a wooden board – these were the sounds that composed the morning symphony of Eleanor Ainsworth’s life. Her small kitchen, tucked away in the back of "The Wandering Wok," a vibrant food truck parked permanently on the edge of Seattle's Pike Place Market, was a whirlwind of controlled chaos.  Rain lashed against the corrugated metal walls, blurring the vibrant hand-painted koi carp that adorned its exterior. Inside, the air hung thick and fragrant, a heady blend of ginger, chili, and the sweet perfume of jasmine tea brewing on a tiny, portable stove. Eleanor, her dark hair pulled back in a messy bun, moved with the grace of a seasoned dancer, her hands a blur as she expertly diced vegetables, her focus absolute. Outside, the first customers of the day, huddled under brightly coloured umbrellas, were already starting to queue, their breath misting in the damp, pre-dawn air, anticipating Eleanor's renowned fusion cuisine.
