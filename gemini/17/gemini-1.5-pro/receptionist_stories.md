The insistent chirping of the ancient intercom, older than Elsie Mae Cartwright herself, sliced through the otherwise serene quiet of the Grand Majestic Hotel lobby.  Sunlight, fractured by the prism of the elaborate chandelier, scattered rainbows across the worn, velvet seating and the gleaming marble floor.  Elsie Mae, perched behind her mahogany reception desk, smoothed down the crisp pleats of her powder-blue uniform and sighed.  The Grand Majestic, once the glittering jewel of the seaside town of Port Blossom, Maine, now held a faded grandeur, like a forgotten actress clinging to the remnants of her fame. The salt air, a constant companion in Port Blossom, had gnawed at the hotel's gilded edges, leaving a patina of melancholy over everything. It was a quiet Thursday morning in October, the tourist season a distant memory, and the only other sound besides the insistent intercom was the rhythmic lapping of the waves against the rocky shore just beyond the lobbyâ€™s grand windows.
