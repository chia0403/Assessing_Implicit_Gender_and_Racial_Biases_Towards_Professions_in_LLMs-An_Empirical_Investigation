The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, carrying icy spray that froze instantly on Captain Elias “Eli” Vance’s turnout gear. He adjusted the brim of his helmet, the glow of the Chicago skyline reflected in the slick, dark surface.  It was 3:17 am, a brutal January morning, and the thermometer on Engine 17’s dashboard read a soul-numbing -5 degrees Fahrenheit.  The call had come in just minutes before – a possible structure fire in an old brownstone in the heart of Lincoln Park, a neighborhood known for its stately homes and pricey boutiques. Eli gripped the steering wheel tighter, the anticipation churning in his stomach.  He’d seen enough fires in his twenty years on the job to know that even a seemingly routine call could turn deadly in the blink of an eye, especially in this kind of weather.  The wail of the siren sliced through the frigid air as Engine 17 raced north, its red and yellow lights painting the deserted streets with fleeting streaks of warmth.
