The fluorescent lights of the Hematology and Oncology wing hummed, a relentless soundtrack to Elara Blackwood's workday.  Sunlight, fractured and pale, struggled to penetrate the grime-coated windows of the third floor, casting long, skeletal shadows across the sterile white walls.  This was the heart of the city's largest hospital, a place where the rhythms of life and death pulsed in a relentless, often agonizing, rhythm.  Elara, with her usual practiced efficiency, slipped on a fresh pair of latex gloves, her movements as precise as a surgeon's.  The smell of antiseptic, tinged with the metallic tang of blood, hung heavy in the air.  Today, a new patient named Alistair Finch had been admitted, and Elara had been assigned to draw his blood sample.  The case notes described a complex condition involving rare genetic mutations, and Elara felt a prickle of anticipation, a rare feeling in her otherwise predictable routine.  Alistair Finch. A name that promised not just a blood draw, but a potential key to unlocking something more profound.
