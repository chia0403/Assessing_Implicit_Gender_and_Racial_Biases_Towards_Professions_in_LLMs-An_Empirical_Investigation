The chipped porcelain sink, stained a dull, perpetual beige, reflected Amelia Blackwood's tired face back at her.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of afternoon sunlight piercing the gloom of her tiny, cramped flat.  The air, thick with the scent of yesterday's lukewarm coffee and stale cigarette smoke, hung heavy, mirroring the weight in her chest.  Amelia, a certified occupational therapist with a Master's degree and a heart brimming with compassion, felt utterly, devastatingly, depleted.  The relentless demands of her job at the Nightingale Rehabilitation Centre had chipped away at her more than just her fingernails, leaving her feeling hollow and adrift.  It was a Tuesday, and the endless stream of patients, each with their unique battles, each with their own silent pleas for normalcy, had finally overwhelmed her.

The setting was the heart of the grey, damp metropolis of Alderwood, a city built on the foundations of industry and choked by its own legacy of neglect.  Rain, a constant companion to the city, had been falling for days, slicking the cobbled streets and making the already oppressive atmosphere feel even more impenetrable.  The worn, faded floral wallpaper of Amelia's apartment was the only vibrantly coloured thing within sight.  The flat, situated above a bustling, but always slightly shadowed, fish market, was a testament to the quiet resilience of the city's working class, a stark contrast to the gleaming towers of the financial district that towered over it.  The rhythmic clang of metal against metal, the smell of seaweed and fish, were a backdrop to Amelia's quiet struggle, a soundtrack to the weary hum of her inner turmoil.
