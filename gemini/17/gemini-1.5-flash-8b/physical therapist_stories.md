Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, a relentless drumming that echoed the frantic rhythm in Amelia Josephine Finch's head.  The fluorescent lights of "Rehab Rx" flickered, casting long, distorted shadows across the sterile, slightly-too-clean waiting room.  A single, skeletal potted fern drooped sadly in a corner, its once vibrant green now dulled to a muted grey.  The air, thick with the scent of antiseptic and the lingering damp of the approaching winter, felt heavy, mirroring the weight Amelia carried within her.  Today, a particularly challenging case awaited her.  The appointment schedule, a meticulously organized chart of rehabilitative therapies and patient profiles, felt like a labyrinth.  Each name, each description of injury and struggle, seemed to tighten the knot of anxiety in her stomach.  It was a Wednesday, and she knew that this particular patient, a young musician with a broken leg, was one of the hardest appointments she would tackle all week.
