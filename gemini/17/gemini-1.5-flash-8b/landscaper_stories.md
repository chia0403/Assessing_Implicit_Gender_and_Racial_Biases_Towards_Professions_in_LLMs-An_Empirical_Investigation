The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's terracotta-colored scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks like tiny shards of ice.  Snow, thick and relentless, coated the already skeletal branches of the ancient oaks lining Willow Creek Road.  Even the usually boisterous creek, normally a rushing ribbon of icy water, was now a frozen, glassy ribbon reflecting the bruised grey sky.  Amelia, a landscaper with hands calloused from years of coaxing life from stubborn soil, hunched deeper into her worn parka.  The biting cold wasn't just a physical assault; it seeped into her spirit, a mirror of the quiet despair settling in her heart.  It was the kind of day that whispered of the impending winter dormancy, a dormancy that felt eerily similar to the one looming over her own life.

Amelia Blackwood worked on a small, struggling landscape design firm called "Green Thumb Gardens," nestled in the shadow of the imposing Blackwood Manor.  The manor, a Gothic masterpiece with towering turrets and a brooding history, had always loomed large over the valley, a constant, stark reminder of the powerful Blackwood family and their legendary – and often troubled – past.  Amelia, a distant relative, had never felt a strong connection to the family, preferring the earthy embrace of the landscape to the echoing halls of the manor.  But her family’s legacy, including the manor and its sprawling grounds, felt inescapable.  The snow-dusted gardens, normally vibrant with colour and life, were now a bleak tableau, reflecting the bleakness within her. The small, but stubbornly independent, company seemed a pale imitation of the grandeur that surrounded them,  a small, fragile thread clinging to a vast and potentially unforgiving world.
