The wind howled a mournful dirge against the skeletal frame of the Victorian mansion, rattling the corrugated iron sheets beneath Bartholomew "Barty"  Featherstone's worn boots.  Rain lashed against the slate roof, a relentless drumming symphony that mirrored the insistent throbbing in his temples.  He hunched lower, clutching the frayed edge of the ladder, the biting chill seeping into his bones.  Dust motes danced in the sliver of light filtering through the grey clouds, illuminating the intricate patterns of the decaying wooden beams.  Barty, his weathered face a roadmap of years spent battling the elements,  focussed on the next repair, another tiny battle in the endless war against the relentless deterioration of the old house.  He was a roofer, a specialist in the delicate dance between man and the storm-ravaged skyline, and this particular roof, the crest of the Blackwood Estate, was his current battlefield.  The Blackwood Estate.  A name whispered with a mixture of awe and dread in the small, rain-swept village of Ashworth, tucked away in the foothills of the misty Pennines.
