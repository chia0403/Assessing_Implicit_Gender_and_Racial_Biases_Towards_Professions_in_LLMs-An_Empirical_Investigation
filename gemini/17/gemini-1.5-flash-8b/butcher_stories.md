The chill of the early morning seeped into Bartholomew "Barty" Grimshaw's bones even through the thick wool of his butcher's coat.  He adjusted the worn leather apron, a familiar weight against his lean frame, and peered out at the grey London fog clinging to the cobbled streets of Spitalfields.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and something faintly metallic, smelled eerily familiar.  It wasn't just the fog; a sense of foreboding, like a low growl rumbling in the depths of the earth, settled upon him.  Barty, known throughout the district for his sharp eye and unwavering hand, felt a prickle of unease he couldn't quite place.  His shop, "Grimshaw's Gilded Hides," nestled between a raucous alehouse and a sprawling, recently-built tenement block, was already humming with the pre-dawn bustle.  But the usual cacophony of hawkers and early risers was muted, replaced by an unsettling quiet. The fog, clinging like a shroud, seemed to press down heavier than usual, blotting out the weak morning sun and casting long, distorted shadows that danced with the chill.
