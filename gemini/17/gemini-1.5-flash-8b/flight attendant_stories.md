The stale air of the Boeing 787, nicknamed "The Celestial Serpent" by the seasoned flight attendants, hung thick with the scent of recycled air and cheap coffee.  Amelia "Amy" Hernandez, meticulously polishing the chrome trim around the emergency exits, felt a familiar tremor of anxiety.  Tonight's flight, BA247, from Mumbai to London, was slated to be the busiest one yet.  The full passenger manifest showed a mix of corporate executives in their power suits, families gathered for the holidays, and a handful of tourists eager to explore the city of a thousand wonders.  But it was the unspoken, underlying current of the impending monsoon season that unsettled Amy more than anything.  The forecast had predicted heavy storms over the Channel, and Amy couldn't shake the premonition of turbulence, both literal and metaphorical, that seemed to be brewing in the air.

The setting was the cramped, pressurized galley of the Boeing 787, just before take-off.  Flickering fluorescent lights cast a harsh glow on the gleaming stainless steel surfaces.  The faint hum of the engines, a low thrumming sound, resonated through the narrow space, punctuated by the rhythmic clatter of trays being cleared and the hushed murmur of fellow flight attendants as they prepared for the journey.  Outside, the tarmac stretched into the fading twilight of a humid Indian evening, the outlines of the vast city blurring into an indistinct mass. Amy could almost taste the spice and the promise of London, but a knot of apprehension tightened in her stomach.
