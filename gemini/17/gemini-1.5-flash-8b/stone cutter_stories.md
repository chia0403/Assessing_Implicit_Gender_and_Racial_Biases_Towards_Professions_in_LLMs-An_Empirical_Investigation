The chipped, grey stone dust, fine as talcum powder, swirled around Elara Blackwood's ankles as she knelt beside the colossal slab.  Sunlight, filtered through the dense canopy of ancient oaks that draped over the quarry, painted the stone in shifting patterns of light and shadow.

Elara, her arms, calloused and scarred, braced against the cold, rough surface, her heart a steady drum against her ribs.  This was the heart of the Whispering Quarry, a place steeped in legend and whispered promises, a place where stone itself held secrets.  She was Elara Blackwood, stone cutter of Blackwood's Quarry, and today, she was facing a challenge unlike any she had encountered in her twenty years of carving.
