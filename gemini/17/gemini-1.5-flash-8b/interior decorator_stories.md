The chipped paint of the Victorian-era banister scraped Amelia Nightingaleâ€™s gloved hand as she ascended the winding staircase.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single, flickering bulb hanging precariously from the ceiling, danced in the air like tiny, ethereal ballerinas.  Below, the cavernous living room, once a riot of vibrant colours and ornate furniture, now lay shrouded in a dusty gloom.  Amelia, a meticulous interior decorator with a penchant for bold colour palettes and a sharp eye for detail, felt a familiar pang of melancholy. This house, the sprawling Victorian manor on the outskirts of Oakhaven, was a testament to a life long past, and now, a silent canvas for her touch.


The house, known as Blackwood Manor, was a gothic masterpiece, its dark grey stone facade etched with intricate carvings.  Ivy, thick as a forest, clawed its way up the walls, creating a shadowy canopy around the estate.  Inside, the air hung heavy with the scent of old books and forgotten memories.  High ceilings, once painted in vibrant hues, now reflected the pallid light in a ghostly sheen.  Large windows, overlooking the shadowed gardens, let in a sliver of pale moonlight, illuminating dust motes that swirled in the still air.  Sunlight struggled to penetrate the dense foliage outside, casting long, skeletal shadows across the opulent, but neglected interior.  The house whispered secrets, and Amelia, with her passion for restoration, was ready to listen.
