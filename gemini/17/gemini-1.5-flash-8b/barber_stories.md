The scent of freshly cut hair, a heady mix of woodsmoke and lavender, clung to the air in "The Razor's Edge," a barbershop tucked away on a cobbled street in the heart of Old Saint-Ã‰milion.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight slicing through the grime-streaked window, illuminating the intricate patterns carved into the mahogany barber's chair.  Behind the gleaming counter,  Bartholomew "Barty" Dubois, a man whose hands seemed to possess a life of their own, meticulously sharpened his shears.  His weathered face, etched with the stories of countless clients, held a quiet intensity, a subtle tension that mirrored the hum of the city outside.  The rhythmic clatter of hooves and the distant cries of vendors were muffled by the thick stone walls, creating an almost serene bubble within the bustling town square.  It was a Tuesday, a day usually slow, but today, Barty felt a prickle of anticipation.  He sensed something was shifting, something out of the ordinary, something that would likely change everything.
