The fluorescent lights of the high school hallway hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to the daily drama unfolding around Amelia Hayes, Guidance Counselor Extraordinaire.  Her name, a mouthful of syllables, often got lost in the murmur of teenage anxieties, the clatter of lockers, and the general cacophony of adolescence.  Today, however, the air felt thick with a palpable tension, a pre-storm stillness that settled over the otherwise vibrant corridors of Westview High.  Posters advertising upcoming school dances and club meetings were plastered on the walls, but even the bright colours seemed muted, dimmed by the impending storm.  Amelia, with her perpetually tired eyes and a perpetually organized planner clutched in her hand, felt a prickle of unease. This wasn't just another Tuesday.  This was going to be different.

The setting was the sprawling, somewhat dilapidated, but undeniably iconic Westview High School.  Built in the mid-20th century, the building’s brick façade had seen decades of students come and go.  Now, cracks in the mortar and peeling paint were the only visible signs of the school's aging infrastructure.  Inside, a labyrinth of hallways snaked through various classrooms, each with its own particular personality, each echoing the anxieties, dreams, and failures of the students they housed.  The air hung heavy with the scent of old textbooks, stale coffee, and the faint, lingering perfume of teenage angst. The worn wooden floors creaked under the weight of hurried footsteps and the soft thud of backpacks slamming against lockers.  The entire atmosphere was imbued with a palpable sense of anticipation and uncertainty, a feeling that mirrored the weight Amelia felt pressing down on her shoulders.
