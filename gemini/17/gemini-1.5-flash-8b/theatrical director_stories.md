The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the cobbled alleyway, illuminating the chipped paint of the "Grand Guignol" theatre.  Rain, a relentless curtain of grey, hammered against the corrugated iron roof, mirroring the storm brewing within Amelia Nightingale, Director of the Grand Guignol.

The cast, a motley crew of aspiring actors and seasoned veterans alike, were a whirlwind of anxieties, each one a tiny tremor in the vast, looming structure of her carefully constructed production.  Amelia, ever the meticulous conductor, surveyed the scene, her gaze flitting between the backstage chaos and the silent, expectant figures huddled within the darkness of the auditorium.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale sawdust, fear, and anticipation, and Amelia knew, with a sinking feeling in her stomach, that this opening night was going to be anything but smooth sailing.
