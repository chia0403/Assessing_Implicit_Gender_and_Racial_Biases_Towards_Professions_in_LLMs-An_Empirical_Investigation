The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Plumb-Easy" storefront cast a sickly yellow glow on Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, Jr., as he wrestled with a stubborn drainpipe.  Water, a relentless enemy, poured from the overflowing sink, a miniature Niagara cascading into the already overflowing bucket heâ€™d positioned precariously beneath.  The air hung heavy with the smell of mildew and desperation.  He was, as usual, the last plumber in the city still open for business this late on a Friday night.  Barty, a man whose calloused hands seemed permanently intertwined with tools, sighed, the sound muffled by the rhythmic gurgle of the overflowing sink.

The setting was the cramped, cluttered back room of Plumb-Easy, a small, independently-owned plumbing shop nestled between a dusty antique store and a bakery with a mysteriously sweet smell that seemed to be fighting for dominance against the wet, stagnant air of the shop.  A tangle of copper pipes, rusted sprockets, and half-finished jobs littered the space, their metallic sheen reflecting the anemic light.  The worn wooden floorboards groaned beneath Barty's weight as he moved from tool to tool, each one a testament to the endless permutations of plumbing problems he'd encountered over the years.  A single, dusty window offered a glimpse into the bustling, chaotic city beyond, where the weekend was already well underway.
