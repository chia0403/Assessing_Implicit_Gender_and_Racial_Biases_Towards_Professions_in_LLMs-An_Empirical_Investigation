This town, Havenwood, nestled in the foothills of the Whispering Mountains, felt different, heavier, and not just because of the impending autumn chill that had settled in.  The air crackled with an unseen tension, a silent tremor that mirrored the unsettling pressure building in Eleanor's chest.  Her practice, nestled in the heart of the quiet town square, felt like a lonely outpost on a rapidly changing frontier. The antique oak desk, polished smooth by countless years of use, seemed to whisper secrets of past lives, past tensions, past traumas.  The faded floral wallpaper, though charming, felt oddly suffocating today.
