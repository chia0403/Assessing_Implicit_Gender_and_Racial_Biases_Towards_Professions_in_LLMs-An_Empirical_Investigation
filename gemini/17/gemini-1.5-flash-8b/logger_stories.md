The biting wind, a relentless claw of ice, whipped across the exposed peaks of the Sawtooth Mountains, stinging Elias Thorne's cheeks.  He hauled himself further up the treacherous slope, the frozen earth clinging to his worn leather boots like a second skin.  The air, thin and frigid, tasted of pine and impending doom.  The sun, a pale disc struggling behind a curtain of swirling clouds, offered little comfort.  Elias, his breath puffing out in white clouds, cursed under his breath.  Another brutally cold day in the unforgiving wilderness of the Idaho backcountry.  He was alone, a solitary figure against a landscape that seemed to swallow him whole.

This section of the Sawtooths, carved into a labyrinth of jagged peaks and shadowed valleys, was known as the "Whispering Pines."  The forest, ancient and impenetrable, was more than just a place to Elias; it was a living entity, whispering tales of forgotten battles and secrets buried deep beneath the roots.  He knew this part of the wilderness like the lines etched into his calloused palms, a knowledge passed down through generations of loggers. But even he, a seasoned woodsman with eyes that could see the very soul of the trees, sensed a foreboding presence, a subtle shift in the forest's usual stillness.
