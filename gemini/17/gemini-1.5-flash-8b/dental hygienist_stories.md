The fluorescent hum of the dental office, a relentless, white-noise soundtrack to Amelia Grace Blackwood's life, was a familiar comfort.  It was the rhythmic heartbeat of her existence, the constant thrum that accompanied the gentle scraping and whirring of instruments, the soft, anxious breaths of her patients.  Today, however, the usual symphony was punctuated by an unusual silence.  The waiting room, usually buzzing with the hushed conversations and rustling of magazines, was eerily quiet.  Just Amelia, hunched over the stainless steel sink, scrubbing a particularly stubborn stain from a patient's porcelain crown.

The setting was Dr. Alistair Finch's dental practice, a stately Victorian building tucked away on a quiet side street in the heart of Blackwood, a town known more for its ancient oaks than its bustling urbanity.  Sunlight, filtered through dusty-rose stained glass windows, cast long shadows across the polished mahogany floors, highlighting the intricate carvings and decorative moldings of the century-old structure.  The scent of antiseptic and faint, floral-scented hand soap hung heavy in the air, a familiar bouquet that had marked Ameliaâ€™s life since her first dental hygiene appointment, the memory of it as vivid as today's unnatural silence.
