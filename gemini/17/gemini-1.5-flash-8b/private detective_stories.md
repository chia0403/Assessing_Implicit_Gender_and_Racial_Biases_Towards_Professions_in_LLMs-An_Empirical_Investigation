The biting wind whipped Amelia Hawthorne's crimson trench coat around her legs, stinging her cheeks with icy pellets.  Grey clouds, thick as a shroud, obscured the already-dim afternoon light in the cobbled alleyway behind the Grand Opera House.  The air, heavy with the scent of damp brick and something vaguely metallic, clung to her like a shroud. This was the heart of Victorian London, a place where shadows stretched long and secrets whispered in the narrow, twisting streets. Amelia, a private investigator with eyes like polished obsidian and a sharp tongue as quick as a viper's strike, hunched deeper into herself, her gaze fixed on the flickering gaslight illuminating a discarded, blood-stained handkerchief.  The case,  a delicate spiderweb of lies and whispered accusations, had led her to this desolate backstreet.  This one, she knew, would require a delicate touch, and a good deal of grit.

Setting: Victorian London, 1888.  The city pulsed with a restless energy, a blend of opulent wealth and grinding poverty.  The Grand Opera House, a magnificent edifice of marble and gilded ornamentation, stood as a stark contrast to the squalor of the alleyways that snaked around it.  Gaslights, flickering and unsteady, cast long, dramatic shadows across the city's streets, illuminating the faces of the wealthy, whilst leaving the poor shrouded in darkness.  A sense of impending change hung in the air, a premonition of the tremors that would soon shake the very foundations of society.
