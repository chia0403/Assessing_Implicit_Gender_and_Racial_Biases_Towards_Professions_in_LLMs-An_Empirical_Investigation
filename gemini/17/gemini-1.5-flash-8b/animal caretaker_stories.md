The biting wind whipped across the exposed moorland, stinging Elara Blackwood's cheeks as she surveyed the sprawling enclosures.  Each clang of a metal gate, each mournful hoot echoing across the desolate landscape, seemed to amplify the chill permeating the air.  The Keeper's Quarters, a small, weather-beaten stone cottage nestled precariously on the edge of the Whispering Moors, was her refuge, a fortress against the howling elements and the even more ferocious loneliness that clung to this forgotten corner of the kingdom.  Elara, a seasoned animal caretaker at the isolated Blackwood Sanctuary, knew the rhythms of the creatures here as intimately as she knew the constellations.  This particular morning, however, a strange quiet hung over the sanctuary, a silence that sent shivers down her spine, more unnerving than the frigid winds. The sanctuary housed a diverse collection of creatures, from the majestic, snow-white polar bear, to the vibrant, emerald-hued emerald gecko lizards that inhabited the biodome.  Elara's specialty though, was the enigmatic, deeply misunderstood wolf-like creatures known as the "Howlers".
