The scent of sugared almonds and buttercream hung heavy in the air, a sweet, cloying perfume that clung to Amelia Josephine Thistlewick like a second skin.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom of her tiny, cluttered bakery, "Sugarplum's Delight."  Stacks of meticulously crafted cake stands, each laden with miniature edible forests and fondant castles, lined the walls, their vibrant colors a stark contrast to the chipped paint and worn linoleum floor.  Amelia, her apron smeared with chocolate frosting and her brow furrowed in concentration, meticulously piped a delicate rose onto a layer cake destined for a lavish wedding.  The rhythmic *tap-tap-tap* of her piping bag was the only sound that broke the otherwise oppressive quiet of the early morning.  Outside, the city hummed with the restless energy of a waking giant, oblivious to the intricate world Amelia was crafting within the four walls of her bakery.
