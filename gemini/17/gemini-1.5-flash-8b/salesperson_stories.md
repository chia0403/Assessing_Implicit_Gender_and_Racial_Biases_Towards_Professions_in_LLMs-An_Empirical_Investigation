Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the "Deals Galore" pawn shop, mirroring the relentless drumming in Elara Blackwood's head.  The air, thick with the smells of stale coffee and desperation, clung to her like a second skin.  Empty shelves, lined with dusty relics of forgotten lives, mocked the dwindling hours of her shift.  Elara, a salesperson with a penchant for finding the silver lining in the most tarnished of objects, was convinced this particular Saturday was going to be a bust.  Deals Galore, tucked away on a side street of the perpetually overcast city of Ashwood, was more a haven for the lost than a hub of commerce.  Her job, a desperate means to an end, felt more like a pilgrimage to a desolate altar.
