The chipped porcelain of the sink, cool against Amelia Cavendish's palm, reflected the flickering neon sign of the "Grand Zenith Hotel."  Rain hammered against the etched glass, blurring the already dim lobby into a swirling grey canvas.  A single, stubborn magnolia blossom, clinging precariously to a wilting vase near the front desk, was the only splash of vibrant color in the otherwise muted space.  Amelia, her tailored navy blazer a stark contrast to the sepia-toned surroundings, meticulously arranged a stack of reservation cards. Each one, a tiny sliver of hope for the weary travelers hunkering down from the storm outside.

The Grand Zenith Hotel, a relic of a bygone era, stood on the edge of the sprawling, perpetually overcast city of Aethelgard.  Once a beacon of opulence, its grandeur had faded, replaced by a quiet, almost melancholic grandeur.  The opulent chandeliers, once glittering with thousands of facets, now cast a dim glow on the polished parquet floors, their light muted by layers of grime.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light piercing through a stained-glass window depicting a mythical phoenix rising from the ashes.  The hotel, a testament to a lost age, held secrets within its crumbling walls, secrets whispered on the wind and felt by the chilled stone. This, Amelia knew, was the quiet, understated drama of her job. And she was, to the core of her being, a connoisseur of that.
