The flickering fluorescent lights of Dr. Eleanor Vance's dental office hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *tap-tap-tap* of her drill.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of afternoon sunlight piercing the grime-coated window, illuminating a stray strand of auburn hair clinging to her temple.  Eleanor Vance, a dentist with a practice nestled on the edge of the perpetually overcast city of Ashbrook,  felt a familiar knot tighten in her stomach.  Not the gnawing anxiety of a particularly challenging extraction, but something deeper, something unsettling that clung to the edges of her awareness like the metallic tang of blood on the air.

**Setting:**

Dr. Vance's practice, "Vance Dental," is a small, unassuming storefront on a side street in Ashbrook, a city perpetually shrouded in a pale, overcast sky.  The city itself feels grey and damp, its architecture a mix of decaying Victorian row houses and newer, utilitarian structures.  A thick layer of industrial smog hangs low over the streets, clinging to the damp cobblestones and the perpetually muddy gutters. The air itself holds a scent of damp earth and something vaguely metallic, a constant undercurrent of unease in the already-unhappy atmosphere.
