Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the second-floor office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Amelia Blackwood, a junior associate at Sterling & Crane, a prestigious but notoriously cutthroat law firm in the heart of London's financial district.  The city, a kaleidoscope of illuminated skyscrapers piercing the gloom, offered little comfort.  Amelia, a woman of meticulous habits and even more meticulous dress, felt a familiar knot tightening in her stomach.  The case—*Re:  The Disappearing Dividend—* was spiralling out of control, and her client, the elderly and frail Lord Ashworth, was losing his fortune, and possibly his sanity, piece by piece.

The office, a cramped space crammed with overflowing filing cabinets and the faint scent of stale coffee, was a far cry from the meticulously organised, if somewhat sterile, world Amelia envisioned for herself.  The relentless ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner of the waiting room seemed to amplify the pressure, each second another nail in the coffin of her client’s hopes.  Outside, the city pulsed with the relentless rhythm of London life, oblivious to the silent struggle taking place within the confines of Sterling & Crane's hallowed halls.
