The fluorescent lights of the "Little Learners" daycare hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Katherine Davies’s life.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun filtering through the grimy windows of the brightly coloured playroom, illuminating a chaotic scene of toddlers wrestling over a discarded teddy bear, a three-year-old wailing about a missing crayon, and a pair of identical twins meticulously stacking blocks that kept falling in a perfect cascade of destruction.  Amelia, a wisp of a woman with perpetually tired eyes and a scattering of dark curls escaping her bun, sighed, the sound barely audible over the din.  It was Tuesday, the day the twins, Leo and Leo, decided to unleash their inner demolition crews.  This, she’d learned, was a recurring theme in their young lives, and her day was shaping up to be the perfect storm of toddler tantrums and meticulously constructed towers of play-dough, crumbling under the relentless onslaught.  Outside, the midday sun beat down relentlessly on the quiet suburban street, a stark contrast to the slightly suffocating atmosphere of the brightly coloured daycare centre.
