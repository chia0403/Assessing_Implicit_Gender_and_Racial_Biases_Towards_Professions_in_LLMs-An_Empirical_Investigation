The biting wind, a razor-sharp whisper against Amelia Blackwood's cheeks, whipped through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks that ringed the abandoned airstrip.  Dust devils, swirling miniature tornadoes of ochre and grey, danced across the cracked tarmac, their ephemeral forms mirroring the chaotic thoughts churning in Amelia's mind.  The rusted skeleton of a biplane, its wings like broken bones against the bruised sky, mocked her from the centre of the overgrown runway.  This wasn't the pristine, manicured tarmac of the Royal Air Force Academy.  This was nowhere near civilisation, a desolate speck on the map swallowed by the unforgiving vastness of the Australian outback.  Amelia, a Spitfire pilot with eyes the colour of storm clouds and a spirit forged in the crucible of relentless training, felt the cold seeping into her very soul, mirroring the chill in the air.  Her name, once a source of pride and recognition within the tight-knit world of military aviation, felt now like a burden, a testament to a past she desperately wanted to erase.  The whispers of the wind seemed to carry the ghosts of missions past, each one a phantom echoing in the lonely expanse.
