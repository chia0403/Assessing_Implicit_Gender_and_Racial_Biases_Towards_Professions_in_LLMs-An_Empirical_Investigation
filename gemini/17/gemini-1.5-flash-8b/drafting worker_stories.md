The rhythmic click-clack of the drafting table echoed through the cavernous workshop, a symphony of precision punctuated by the occasional groan of a metal beam or the exasperated sigh of a tired draftsman.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grime-coated windows of "The Ironclad Forge," a workshop swallowed by the sprawling industrial heart of New Birmingham.  It was a place where steel reigned supreme, and ideas, forged in the minds of men like Elias Thorne, were translated into the tangible form of bridges, buildings, and ships.

Elias Thorne, a drafting worker with hands as calloused as the blueprints he meticulously traced, hunched over his table.  He wore a faded blue smock, the remnants of countless hours spent within the suffocating heat of the forge, and his spectacles were dusted with charcoal, mirroring the smudged graphite on the tracing paper beneath them.  Around him, other figures moved with the familiar, practiced movements of their trade.  Men with faces etched by years of toil, women with strength in their eyes, each contributing to the vast, intricate tapestry of the cityâ€™s infrastructure.
