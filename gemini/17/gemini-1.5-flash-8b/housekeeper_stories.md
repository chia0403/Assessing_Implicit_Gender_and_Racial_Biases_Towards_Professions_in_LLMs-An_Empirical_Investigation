The chipped porcelain sink, stained a dull, perpetual beige, reflected the sickly yellow light filtering through the grime-coated windowpanes of Mrs. Abigail "Abby" Blackwood's cleaning sanctuary.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light, pirouetting like miniature ballerinas in a forgotten ballet.  Abby, her auburn hair pulled back in a tight bun,  scrubbed at a stubborn smudge on the antique mahogany sideboard with a zeal that belied her seventy-two years.  The scent of lavender, a constant companion in her small, cluttered apartment, mingled with the faint, cloying perfume that clung to the air of the grand Victorian mansion she cleaned.  It was the kind of perfume that screamed of wealth and barely-contained desperation.

The house, known as "Willow Creek Manor," stood perched atop a hill overlooking the sprawling, fog-shrouded valley.  Ancient oaks, their branches draped with spiderwebs like ghostly shrouds, surrounded the imposing structure, their gnarled roots clawing at the foundations as if trying to drag the mansion into the earth.  Ivy, thick and emerald green, clung to the crumbling stone walls, its tendrils reaching out like grasping fingers, obscuring the windows and hinting at the secrets within.  The air itself felt thick with a history that whispered of generations past, of hushed conversations and whispered secrets, of grand balls and silent tears.  Within these walls, Abby, the quiet, unassuming housekeeper, bore witness to the ever-shifting dramas of the Blackwood family.
