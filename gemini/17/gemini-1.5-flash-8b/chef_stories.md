The aroma of roasted cinnamon-spiced apples hung heavy in the air, mingling with the sharp tang of citrus from the nearby lemon grove.  Sunlight, filtered through the leaves, dappled the polished terracotta tiles of the courtyard, illuminating the intricate mosaics depicting mythical creatures.  This was the heart of "Aromas of the Aegean," a small, family-run restaurant tucked away in a sun-drenched corner of Santorini, and it was where 27-year-old  Athanasia "Theo" Dimitriou, a chef with a fire in her soul and flour dusted on her apron, meticulously crafted her culinary masterpieces.  Today, a particularly boisterous wedding party was celebrating their union, their laughter echoing through the ancient stone walls. Theo, with her olive-toned skin and eyes the colour of a summer sky, felt a surge of creative energy.  The pressure cooker, a gleaming silver behemoth, hissed softly, a rhythmic counterpoint to the joyful chaos.  This was her stage, this was her symphony, and today, she would conduct it with precision, passion, and a sprinkle of magic.
