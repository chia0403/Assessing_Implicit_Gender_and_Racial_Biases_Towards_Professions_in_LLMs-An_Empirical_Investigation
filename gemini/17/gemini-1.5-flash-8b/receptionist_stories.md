The fluorescent lights of the "Apex Consulting" reception hummed, a monotonous drone that echoed Amelia Blackwood's quiet sigh.  8:15 AM.  The chipped Formica of her desk felt cool against her palm as she meticulously alphabetized the overflowing stack of urgent memos.  Outside, the city was already stirring, a low rumble of traffic and distant sirens a constant backdrop to her meticulously organized chaos.  Amelia, with her perpetually neat bun and perfectly pressed uniform, felt strangely adrift.  The typical flurry of morning activity – the hushed whispers of clients, the insistent ringing of the phone, the controlled chaos of paperwork – hadn’t yet begun.  It was the quiet before the storm, and it felt unsettlingly empty.  The beige walls of the reception area, stark and impersonal, seemed to absorb the silence.  Apex Consulting, a firm specializing in high-stakes mergers and acquisitions, exuded an aura of quiet power.  Today, that power felt distant, almost oppressive.
