The fluorescent lights of the emergency room hummed, a dissonant counterpoint to the frantic murmurs and the rhythmic beep-boop-beep of the heart monitors.  Rain lashed against the windows of St. Jude's Hospital, blurring the already-hazy cityscape outside.  Dr. Amelia Hayes, a registered nurse with five years of experience, stood hunched over a gurney, her brow furrowed in concentration.  The air, thick with the smell of antiseptic and fear, clung to her like a second skin.  A young man, barely out of his teens, lay unconscious, his chest rising and falling with laboured breaths, his face pale and clammy.  Around them, the other nurses and doctors moved with the frantic precision of ants in a collapsing anthill, their movements a blur of hurried footsteps and hushed conversations.  The relentless pressure of the night shift was palpable, a tangible weight pressing down on Amelia. This wasn't just another night; something felt different, something ominous.  This wasn't just a patient. This was a crisis, and Amelia was on the front lines.
