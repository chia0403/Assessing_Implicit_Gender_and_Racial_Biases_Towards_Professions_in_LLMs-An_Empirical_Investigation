Professor Alistair Finch-Wren, a man whose tweed jacket perpetually held the faint scent of old books and pipe tobacco, stared out the grimy window of his cramped office at the perpetually overcast London sky.  Rain, a relentless, pewter-coloured curtain, hammered against the ancient panes, mirroring the tempest brewing inside him.  The year was 1932, and the air in the cramped, cluttered room of the University College of London, usually thick with the murmur of student chatter, felt almost suffocatingly still.  Not a single student dared approach his door, for word had spread like wildfire: Professor Finch-Wren was lost in a labyrinth of his own making, his lectures cancelled, his research seemingly abandoned.  Weeks ago, the discovery of a cryptic manuscript, hidden within the dusty archives of the college library, had sent him spiralling into a profound obsession.  He believed the words held a key, not just to an obscure historical mystery, but to a far more profound, unsettling truth about the nature of reality itself.  And now, the relentless rain, the echoing silence, and the growing weight of unanswered questions threatened to consume him entirely.
