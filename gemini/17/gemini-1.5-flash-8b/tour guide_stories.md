The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks as she surveyed the cobbled streets of Prague.  Above, the spires of St. Vitus Cathedral pierced the leaden sky, a stark contrast to the muted colours of the early November day.  This was her 27th year leading the "Hidden Prague" tour, and yet, the city never ceased to surprise her.  Today's group, a gaggle of boisterous American tourists, were already chattering excitedly, oblivious to the quiet drama unfolding behind the weathered facades.  Amelia, dressed in her signature well-worn brown coat, adjusted her satchel, her fingers tracing the familiar constellations of her guidebook.  This particular tour focused on the city's alchemists and their shrouded secrets. The whispers of forgotten laboratories, lost potions, and stolen treasures hung heavy in the air, a siren's call to anyone with a thirst for the extraordinary.  She knew, instinctively, that this tour held a particular resonance for her, a pull deeper than the usual thrill of sharing stories.  It was not just about the history; it was about the unseen energy humming beneath the city's surface, a silent promise of untold tales.
