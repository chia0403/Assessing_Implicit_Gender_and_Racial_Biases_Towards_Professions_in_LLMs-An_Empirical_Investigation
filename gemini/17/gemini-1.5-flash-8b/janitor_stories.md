The fluorescent lights of the Metropolitan Museum of Art hummed, a monotonous drone that punctuated the otherwise silent corridors.  Dust motes, illuminated by the harsh glare, danced in the air like spectral confetti.  Elias Thorne, a man whose own quiet presence seemed almost to disappear against the grand backdrop of marble and gold, pushed a gleaming chrome cart laden with cleaning supplies.  His uniform, a navy blue polo shirt and khaki pants, blended seamlessly with the shadows, making him almost invisible in the cavernous halls.  He was a janitor, a silent guardian of the city's artistic treasures, a man whose work was as much about preservation as it was about quiet duty.

The setting was the vast, echoing galleries of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, a sprawling labyrinth of history and artistry. Sunlight, filtered through stained-glass windows, dappled the polished floors in patterns of shimmering color, while the air hung thick with the scent of old paper and aged paint.  The hushed whispers of museum visitors, a constant murmur of awe and admiration, were largely unheard by Elias, lost in the rhythmic rhythm of his cleaning.  Today, however, a peculiar chill lingered in the air, a sense of something unseen yet palpable, a disquiet that unsettled the usual tranquility of the museum.
