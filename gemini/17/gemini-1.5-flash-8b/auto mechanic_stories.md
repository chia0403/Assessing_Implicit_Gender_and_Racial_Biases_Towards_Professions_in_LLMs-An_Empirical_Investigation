The greasy air hung thick with the smell of burnt rubber and spent engine oil, a familiar perfume to Bartholomew "Barty"  Fitzwilliam.  He wiped a smear of grime from his brow, the fluorescent lights of "Rusty Wrench Repair" flickering overhead like anxious eyes.  The shop, nestled between a bakery with a perpetually overflowing display of pastries and a secondhand bookstore filled with forgotten tales, hummed with the low thrum of machinery and the occasional frustrated sigh.  It was a Tuesday, a day usually reserved for the less urgent repairs, the ones that could wait until the weekend rush subsided.  But today, a peculiar sound had drawn Barty's attention, a high-pitched whine that echoed through the workshop, a sound unlike anything he'd heard before.


The setting is a small, somewhat cluttered auto repair shop in a bustling, if slightly run-down, urban neighborhood.  The mix of smells – freshly baked bread, old paper, and the metallic tang of car parts – creates a unique atmosphere.  The shop itself reflects Barty's personality – organized chaos; tools neatly arranged amongst heaps of parts, the faint glow of LEDs illuminating the space, and the constant hum of machinery.  Barty's worn, yet practical mechanic's uniform, stained with the marks of a hundred previous jobs, suggests years of experience and a deep connection to the inner workings of machines.
