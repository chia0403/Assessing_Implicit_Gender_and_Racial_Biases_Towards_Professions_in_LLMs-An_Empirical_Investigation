Rain hammered against the grimy windows of the law firm, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic rhythm of Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's thoughts.  The fluorescent lights of the paralegal office buzzed, casting an eerie glow on the mountains of legal documents piled haphazardly on her desk.  She was drowning in discovery requests, each one a tiny, yet overwhelming, wave threatening to capsize her carefully constructed schedule.  It was a Tuesday in late October, a day that felt like a week, and the air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and impending deadlines.

The office, a small, cramped space tucked away on the third floor of a downtown skyscraper, was more reminiscent of a storage unit than a legal haven.  Dusty, beige carpeting muffled the sounds of the relentless typing and hushed whispers that emanated from the partner's office directly above.  The stale air, heavy with the scent of photocopying paper and desperation, hung like a shroud.  Beyond the narrow windows, the city sprawled out in a muted palette of grey and brown, a cityscape reflecting the turmoil brewing within Amelia.
