Rain lashed against the stained-glass windows of the English department, blurring the already faded floral patterns into a kaleidoscope of muted colors.  Dampness clung to the air, mirroring the heavy weight in Amelia's chest.  It wasn't just the cold; it was the unease, the creeping suspicion that something – something profoundly wrong – was about to shatter the fragile peace of her meticulously ordered life.

Its weathered brick buildings, shadowed by ancient, gnarled oaks, whispered tales of bygone glory, tales Amelia, with her passion for forgotten poets and dusty tomes, was acutely aware of.  Today, though, those whispers seemed to hold a sinister undercurrent.  The school felt…suffocated.
