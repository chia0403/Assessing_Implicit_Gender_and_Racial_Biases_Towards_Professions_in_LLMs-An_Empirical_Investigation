The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune, bouncing off the meticulously organized piles of tax forms stacked precariously on the desk. Amelia Pearl Finnegan, income tax preparer extraordinaire, suppressed a groan. Another late night. The air in her small office, nestled above a bustling bakery in the heart of Cedar Creek, smelled faintly of cinnamon and regret – the regret of procrastinators who’d waited until the last minute to file their taxes, now begging for her mercy. Outside, the cheerful chatter of the bakery staff closing up drifted up, a stark contrast to the tense silence that Amelia preferred. She rubbed her tired eyes, the screen of her computer blurring with W-2s and 1099s. Cedar Creek, a quaint town known for its annual Apple Blossom Festival and the suspiciously high number of antique shops per capita, seemed idyllic from the outside, but Amelia knew its dark secret: everyone procrastinated on their taxes. And Amelia Pearl Finnegan was their only hope.
