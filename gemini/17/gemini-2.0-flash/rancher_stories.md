## Story Opening:

The wind, a relentless sculptor of the plains, had been chewing at Jedediah Lincoln Caldwell's weathered face all morning. He squinted against the dust devil dancing across the dried-up creek bed, its swirling chaos a miniature replica of the worry churning in his gut. The sun, a pitiless judge in the cloudless sky, beat down on his worn Stetson, offering no reprieve from the heat. Jedediah spat a stream of tobacco juice into the parched earth, the brown stain disappearing almost instantly. He hadn't seen rain in what felt like a lifetime, and the land was screaming for it, each brittle blade of grass a testament to its thirst.

## Setting:

The sprawling Caldwell Ranch, nestled precariously on the edge of the Dust Bowl's remnants in southwestern Oklahoma, was once a testament to Jedediah's grandfather's vision. Now, the once-lush pastures were cracked and barren. The sturdy, two-story farmhouse, built of red brick and framed by a wide, wrap-around porch, stood as a lonely sentinel against the encroaching desolation. Beyond the house, a cluster of weathered barns and outbuildings huddled together, their paint peeling like sunburnt skin. In the distance, the Wichita Mountains rose like jagged teeth against the horizon, a stark reminder of the harsh, unforgiving beauty of the land.
