The air in Dr. Eleanor Vance’s office hung thick with the cloying scent of lavender and unspoken anxieties. Rain lashed against the panoramic window, blurring the neon grid of downtown Chicago into an Impressionist smear of color. Eleanor, perched on the edge of her worn, velvet armchair, watched the water cascade down the glass, mirroring the tumultuous emotions she often absorbed from her patients.

Eleanor’s office, high up in the John Hancock Center, was her sanctuary. The sleek, modern building provided a stark contrast to the warm, almost bohemian, interior she had painstakingly cultivated. Persian rugs muffled the sounds of the city, while bookshelves overflowing with Freud, Jung, and the latest neuroscientific research lined the walls. A small, carefully curated collection of antique clocks ticked softly, a constant reminder of time's relentless march, a truth Eleanor grappled with daily in her practice.

This particular Tuesday evening, the rain seemed to amplify the darkness that clung to her last patient of the day, a darkness Eleanor was steeling herself to confront. She straightened the framed photograph of her late father, a gentle smile gracing her lips for a fleeting moment. He had been the one to encourage her path, to see the empathy in her eyes before she even recognized it herself. Now, she just hoped she had enough left to offer whoever was about to walk through that door.
