The scent of stale glitter glue and apple slices hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume that usually soothed Ms. Eleanor Penelope Hawthorne. Today, however, it only amplified the knot of anxiety tightening in her stomach. It was picture day at Little Sprouts Academy, and Eleanor knew, with a bone-deep certainty, that chaos was brewing.

Little Sprouts was nestled in the heart of Oakwood, a charming suburb dotted with sprawling oak trees and meticulously manicured lawns. The Academy itself was a converted Victorian house, painted a cheerful shade of dandelion yellow, with a white picket fence enclosing a playground that was, on most days, a miniature battlefield of imagination and runny noses. Eleanor's classroom, the "Busy Bees," occupied what was once the grand dining room. Sunlight streamed through the bay window, illuminating rows of tiny chairs and tables covered in colorful construction paper creations. Posters depicting the alphabet, numbers, and various farm animals adorned the walls, alongside the children's own artwork, a vibrant collage of handprints, squiggly lines, and abstract portraits of their families.
