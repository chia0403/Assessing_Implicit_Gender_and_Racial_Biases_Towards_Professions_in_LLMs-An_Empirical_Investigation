The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, stinging Marco Anthony Bellini’s cheeks and turning the perpetually damp Chicago air into icy needles. He pulled his Carhartt hood tighter, the familiar smell of sawdust and diesel clinging to the fabric. Marco squinted at the steel skeleton of the future “Harborview Residences,” a gleaming glass and steel monolith that promised luxury living to the city’s elite. His gloved hands, roughened and scarred from years of wrestling concrete and steel, tightened around the cold metal beam he was about to walk across. Forty stories up, without a safety net in sight, the wind was his only companion, and the churning, gray expanse of the lake his unforgiving audience. Below, the city spread out like a child’s scattered toys – yellow taxi cabs, miniature people scurrying along the sidewalks, the distant rumble of traffic barely audible over the wind's howl. This was his office for the next eight hours, and today, like most days, Marco wasn't entirely sure he'd make it back down. He took a deep breath, the frigid air burning in his lungs, and reminded himself: one beam at a time.
