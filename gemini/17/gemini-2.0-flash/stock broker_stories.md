Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a stock broker:

**Opening:**

The stale scent of coffee, mingled with the frenetic buzz of Bloomberg terminals, clung to the air like a shroud. Theodore Alexander Blackwood III stared out at the pre-dawn Manhattan skyline, a million shimmering, uncaring rectangles reflecting back his own anxiety. Another day. Another billion dollars to chase. His stomach churned, not from the mediocre espresso he'd choked down, but from the gut-wrenching fear that today, the delicate house of cards he'd so painstakingly built would finally come crashing down. He adjusted his perfectly knotted tie, the silk suddenly feeling suffocating, and picked up the ringing phone. The familiar voice of his biggest client, Reginald Barrington IV, boomed in his ear. "Blackwood! Where are my numbers? I need to see green, Theodore. Green!"

**Setting:**

The story is primarily set in the high-stakes world of **Wall Street, New York City** during the **early 2000s**, a period of relative economic boom but also simmering unease leading up to the 2008 financial crisis.

*   **Specifically, Theodore's primary location is the high-powered trading floor of "Goldstar Sachs,"** a fictional investment bank. The floor is a chaotic symphony of ringing phones, shouting traders, and glowing screens displaying real-time market data.
*   **His lavish, impeccably decorated office on the 40th floor** offers panoramic views of the city, a constant reminder of the wealth and power he wields, and the potential for both to vanish in an instant. Itâ€™s a space of polished mahogany, expensive art, and a subtle undercurrent of tension.
*   **The story also occasionally ventures into the opulent apartments of Theodore's clients** on the Upper East Side, exclusive restaurants where deals are brokered over expensive wine, and the luxurious Hamptons estates where the elite unwind (or pretend to) on weekends.

I hope this is a good start! Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on anything or continue the story.
