## Story Opening:

The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of frangipani and exhaust fumes, a uniquely Colombo cocktail that assaulted Eleanor Rose Ashworth's nostrils as she waited for her tour group to gather. Sunlight glared off the corrugated iron roofs of the Pettah market, making her squint despite the wide-brimmed straw hat perched on her head. Eleanor sighed, the sound lost in the cacophony of hawkers yelling their wares, tuk-tuks buzzing like angry wasps, and the rhythmic clang of metal being hammered into intricate brass pots. Her carefully curated smile, the one she reserved for tourists bewildered by the organized chaos of Sri Lanka, was starting to feel a little brittle.

"Right on time, as always," she muttered to a stray dog, its ribs showing prominently through its matted fur. He didn't reply, just gave her a wary glance before ambling off in search of discarded scraps. Eleanor glanced at her watch, a battered old Timex that had seen more of the world than most of her clients. Precisely nine o'clock. Where were they?

## Setting:

The story opens in the *Pettah Market* in Colombo, Sri Lanka. This vibrant, bustling marketplace is a sensory overload of sights, smells, and sounds. Narrow, crowded streets overflow with vendors selling everything from spices and textiles to electronics and fresh produce. The air is thick with the aroma of exotic spices, the clatter of bargaining, and the incessant honking of vehicles trying to navigate the chaotic traffic. Buildings are a mix of dilapidated colonial structures and more modern, but often equally run-down, storefronts. The scene is a kaleidoscope of color, from the vibrant saris of the local women to the mountains of brightly colored fruits and vegetables piled high on market stalls. The humidity hangs heavy, making even simple tasks feel exhausting. The market represents a microcosm of Sri Lanka itself: a blend of ancient traditions and modern challenges, poverty and resilience, beauty and grit.
