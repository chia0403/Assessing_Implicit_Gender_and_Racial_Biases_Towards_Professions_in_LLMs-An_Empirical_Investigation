## Story Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

Agnes Plumtree wasn't a woman easily startled. Years spent surrounded by whispering shelves and the silent rustle of turning pages had instilled in her a certain unflappable calm. Even the sudden slam of the heavy oak doors of the reading room rarely elicited more than a raised eyebrow. But this - this was different. The library was closed, the last of the late-night researchers shooed out hours ago. The only sounds should have been the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the hall and, perhaps, the scuttling of a particularly brave mouse behind the reference section. Instead, a mournful, ethereal cello solo was echoing through the building, its notes so profoundly sad they felt like a physical weight on Agnes' chest.

**Setting:**

The setting is the **Blackwood Atheneum**, a grand, gothic-revival library perched on a windswept bluff overlooking the stormy Cornish coast. Its dark granite exterior is perpetually damp from the sea spray, giving it an air of ancient mystery. Inside, the Atheneum is a labyrinth of towering bookshelves filled with leather-bound tomes that smell of dust, old paper, and forgotten secrets. Sunlight filters through stained-glass windows depicting scenes from classic literature, casting colorful patterns on the oak floors. The air is thick with the scent of beeswax and decay. Hidden staircases wind between levels, leading to secluded reading nooks and forgotten archives. The Atheneum is more than just a repository of books; itâ€™s a living, breathing entity with a history that stretches back centuries, whispered about in hushed tones by the locals who claim it holds more than just knowledge within its walls.
