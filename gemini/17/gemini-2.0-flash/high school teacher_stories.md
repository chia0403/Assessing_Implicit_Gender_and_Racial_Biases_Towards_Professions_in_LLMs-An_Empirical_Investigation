The insistent bleating of his phone cut through the pre-dawn gloom like a rusty saw. Arthur Reginald Penhaligon groaned, burying his face deeper into his pillow, a faded tartan monstrosity he’d inherited from his Great Aunt Mildred. He knew exactly what it was: a school-wide emergency alert regarding a burst pipe in the gym. He’d only just managed to convince his students that the French Revolution was about more than just cake, and now this.

The setting was the small, perpetually damp coastal town of Port Blossom, Maine. The air smelled perpetually of salt and slightly decaying seaweed, a scent Arthur had grown accustomed to, despite harboring dreams of escaping to sun-drenched Tuscan vineyards ever since he’d first cracked open a bottle of Chianti Classico back in college. He lived in a modest, slightly lopsided Victorian house on Lobster Cove Road, a street lined with similar homes, each with peeling paint and a stubborn, defiant air that mirrored the spirit of its inhabitants. His house, affectionately nicknamed "The Seashell," was filled with an eclectic collection of antique furniture, mismatched china, and an ever-growing library of classic literature, reflecting his passion for history and a yearning for a time when things felt…simpler.
