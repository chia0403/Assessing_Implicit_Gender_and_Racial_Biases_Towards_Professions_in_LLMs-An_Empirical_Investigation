The chipped ceramic mug, adorned with the aggressively cheerful slogan "Keep Calm and Counsel On," warmed Dr. Eleanor Victoria Ainsworth's hands as she stared out the rain-streaked window. The view, typically a vibrant tableau of elementary school children scampering across the playground, was a muted wash of gray. The perpetually damp Pacific Northwest weather seemed to mirror the collective mood hanging heavy in the halls of Hawthorne Elementary, a well-worn but beloved institution nestled in the heart of Maplewood, Oregon.

It was Monday morning, a notoriously volatile day even on the sunniest of weeks, but this Monday was different. This Monday, the shadow of a student tragedy hung over everything, thick and suffocating. Eleanor, a veteran of countless parent-teacher conferences and adolescent anxieties, felt the familiar knot of dread tightening in her stomach. She knew, instinctively, that this week wouldn't be about standardized tests or friendship squabbles. This week would be about grief, about healing, and about trying to help a community – a community she was deeply embedded in – navigate the unthinkable. The lukewarm coffee did little to settle her nerves. She took another sip, bracing herself for the inevitable knock on her door and the barrage of questions she knew she wouldn't have easy answers for.
