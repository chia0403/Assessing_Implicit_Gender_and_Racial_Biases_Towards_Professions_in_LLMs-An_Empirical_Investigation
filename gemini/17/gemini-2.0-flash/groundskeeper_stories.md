Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a groundskeeper named Bartholomew Finch:

**Setting:**

The story opens on the sprawling, untamed grounds of Blackwood Manor, a gothic monstrosity perched precariously on the cliffs overlooking the churning Atlantic. Blackwood Manor hadn't seen a paintbrush or a social call in decades. Vines, thick as pythons, wrestled with the crumbling stonework, and the once-manicured lawns had surrendered to a riot of wildflowers, thistles, and the relentless, salty wind. The air was thick with the scent of sea salt, damp earth, and something else… something indefinably *old* and slightly unsettling, like dust motes dancing in a forgotten attic. The perpetual gloom clung to the manor, even on the rare days when the sun dared to break through the thick, gray clouds.

**Story Opening:**

The rusted gate, groaning like a tormented soul, gave way under the familiar weight of Bartholomew Finch's shoulder. He straightened, a thin man with a stooped posture and a weathered face that seemed to have absorbed the color of the granite cliffs themselves. Bartholomew pushed a stray strand of silver hair from his eyes, the wind whipping it around his face, and surveyed his kingdom – a kingdom of rampant weeds and dilapidated grandeur.

Another limb had fallen from the ancient oak near the west wing, he noted with a sigh. And the ivy was creeping dangerously close to the stained-glass window of the library. Bartholomew Finch had been the groundskeeper of Blackwood Manor for over thirty years, long after the family, the Blackwoods, had faded into whispers and legends. He was the sole caretaker of this decaying monument, a silent sentinel against the relentless march of time and the encroaching wilderness. He knew every gnarled root, every crumbling gargoyle, every whispering breeze that snaked through the overgrown paths. He knew them better, perhaps, than he knew himself.

He pulled his worn leather gloves tighter and adjusted the brim of his battered tweed hat. Today's task was the rose garden. Or what *used* to be the rose garden. More likely, today's task was a battle against the insidious brambles that had claimed the space, a battle he fought and lost, then fought again, every single year. As he trudged towards the overgrown patch, a flicker of movement caught his eye. Something white, nestled amongst the thorns, glinted in the pale morning light. Something... unusual.
