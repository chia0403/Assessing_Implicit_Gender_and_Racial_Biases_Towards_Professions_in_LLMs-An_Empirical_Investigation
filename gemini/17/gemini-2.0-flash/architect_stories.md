Okay, here's a story opening and setting, focusing on architect Eliza Rowan Thorne:

**Setting:** The story opens on a blustery late-autumn morning in Charleston, South Carolina. Not the historic district, brimming with tourists and horse-drawn carriages, but the slightly rougher, rapidly gentrifying neighborhood of Elliotborough. The air smells of salt, damp brick, and brewing coffee from the artisanal roastery down the block. Victorian row houses, some lovingly restored, others crumbling with faded grandeur, line the narrow streets. Overhead, Spanish moss drips from live oaks like ghostly curtains. The rhythmic clang of hammers and the roar of construction vehicles are a constant soundtrack, a symphony of change.

**Opening:**

Eliza Rowan Thorne, architect, stood shivering on the stoop of 31 Legare Street, a half-empty mug of lukewarm coffee clutched in her gloved hands. The Charleston wind, a biting, almost malevolent force today, whipped at the loose strands of hair escaping her messy bun, stinging her cheeks. Thirty-one Legare. It was more ruin than residence. Decades of neglect had reduced the once-stately townhouse to a shell – peeling paint, rotting porch timbers, and a roof that sagged with the weariness of centuries.

She sighed, the steam of her breath vanishing into the grey morning. This was her most challenging commission yet. Not because of the structural deficiencies, which were plentiful, nor the labyrinthine legal battles with the estate of the deceased owner, which were ongoing. But because of the whispered stories that clung to the place like the ubiquitous Spanish moss, stories of a tragic fire, a heartbroken ghost, and a legacy of bad luck. Eliza, a woman who prized logic and clean lines above all else, usually dismissed such nonsense. But even *she* felt a prickle of unease as she stared at the decaying façade, the eyes of the house seemingly staring back, daring her to disturb its slumber. Today, she would begin. Today, she would attempt to breathe new life into this haunted husk. Today, she would probably regret ever answering the damn phone.
