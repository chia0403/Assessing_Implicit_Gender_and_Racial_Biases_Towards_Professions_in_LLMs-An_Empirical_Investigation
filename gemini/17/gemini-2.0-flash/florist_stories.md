## Story Opening and Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The scent of damp earth and dying lilies hung thick in the air, clinging to Clementine Willowbrook like a second skin. She knelt, her linen trousers dusted with peat moss, coaxing a wilting orchid back to life. The delicate purple petals, once vibrant and proud, now drooped with a resignation that mirrored her own. Outside, the relentless Seattle drizzle hammered against the greenhouse glass, a melancholic soundtrack to her solitary battle against the encroaching decay. Clementine pinched off a yellowing leaf, a sigh escaping her lips. Another Tuesday, another floral funeral.

**Setting:**

Clementine Willowbrook owns and operates a small, independent flower shop called "Willowbrook Blooms" located in the quirky, artsy neighborhood of Ballard, Seattle. The shop itself is a study in organized chaos. Bunches of vibrant blooms in every imaginable color overflow from galvanized steel buckets, contrasting against the worn, wooden floors and the peeling paint on the walls. A vintage chandelier, draped with dried ivy, hangs precariously from the ceiling, casting a warm, albeit dim, glow. The back of the shop opens into a small, perpetually humid greenhouse, a haven for more exotic and temperamental plants. Rain-streaked windows offer a glimpse of the bustling street outside, a constant reminder of the world beyond her fragrant, green sanctuary. The air is a heady mix of earthy soil, sweet perfume, and the faint, metallic tang of flower shears.
