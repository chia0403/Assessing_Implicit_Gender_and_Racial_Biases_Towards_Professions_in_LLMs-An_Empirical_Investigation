## Story Opening:

The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the shack, mimicking the relentless pounding in Eleanor Vance's chest. She squinted at the blurry, black-and-white photograph held up to the flickering gas lamp. A young woman, barely out of her teens, stared back with eyes that had seen far too much. Her lips were set in a defiant line, a stark contrast to the haunted fragility that clung to her like the damp chill of the bayou. Eleanor tapped the photo against her knee, the sound swallowed by the storm raging outside. Three months. Three months since her disappearance, and the local Sheriff had already labeled it a runaway case. Eleanor knew better. The Sheriff hadn't looked, not really. He saw a swamp girl, nothing more. Eleanor Vance saw a story. A story that simmered with injustice, with secrets buried deep in the Louisiana mud. A story that was about to break wide open.

## Setting:

**Location:** A dilapidated, one-room shack on the fringes of the Atchafalaya Basin in Louisiana. The shack sits precariously on stilts above the muddy ground, surrounded by cypress trees draped with Spanish moss. The air is thick with humidity and the smell of decay.

**Time:** Late evening, a stormy night in October.

**Atmosphere:** Oppressive, isolated, and filled with a sense of foreboding. The constant sound of the rain and wind amplifies the feeling of being cut off from the rest of the world. The interior of the shack is sparsely furnished: a rickety cot, a small wooden table cluttered with papers and empty coffee cups, and a kerosene lamp that casts long, dancing shadows on the walls. The only splash of color comes from a map of the Atchafalaya Basin pinned to the wall, marked with various locations and cryptic notes in Eleanor's messy handwriting.
