The fluorescent lights of the Starlight Cinema buzzed with a nervous energy that seemed to hum right into the bones of Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins. It was 3:17 AM, and Bart, armed with his trusty mop and a bucket full of industrial-strength cleaner, was the last sentient being left in this cathedral of cinematic dreams. The stale smell of popcorn and regret hung heavy in the air, a testament to the double feature that had just ended: a rom-com that even Bart, a man of simple pleasures, found saccharine and a superhero flick so loud it threatened to dislodge the fillings in his teeth.

The Starlight was a relic, a grand old dame clinging to the past in a world obsessed with streaming services and fifteen-dollar popcorn. Located on the once-glamorous, now-slightly-rundown edge of downtown Havenwood, it boasted three screens, each adorned with faded velvet curtains and a lingering air of faded grandeur. Tonight, Bart was tackling Screen One, the largest and most frequently used, its vast expanse of plush seating now littered with discarded wrappers, half-eaten boxes of candy, and the occasional lost glove, a silent testament to the lives momentarily lived within its darkened confines. He sighed, the sound swallowed by the cavernous space, and began his Sisyphean task. The Starlight Cinema was more than just a job to Bart; it was a sanctuary, a place where, in the quiet hours, he could lose himself in the echoes of stories and the comforting rhythm of his work.
