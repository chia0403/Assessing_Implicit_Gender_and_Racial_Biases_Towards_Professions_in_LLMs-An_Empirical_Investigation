The bell above the door of "Shear Bliss" tinkled a cheerful, albeit slightly desperate, chime as Agnes Beatrice Plumtree stepped inside, shaking the rain from her floral-patterned umbrella. Agnes, with her perpetual expression of bewildered kindness and a cloud of perpetually untamed, frizz-prone auburn hair, was precisely the kind of customer that Evelyn Rose Carter both dreaded and secretly adored.

Shear Bliss, Evelyn's tiny salon, was a haven tucked away on Lavender Lane, a cobblestone street in the heart of Meadowbrook, a town that had a disproportionate number of elderly residents and a distinctly disproportionate lack of trendsetters. The walls were painted a calming lavender (naturally), adorned with framed, slightly-yellowed prints of hairstyles from bygone eras. A faint, lingering scent of perm solution and lilac potpourri hung in the air, a scent that Evelyn, a thirty-two-year-old with a secret yearning for the vibrant chaos of a big city salon, had long ago become desensitized to.

Beyond the reception desk, which was currently piled high with magazines featuring celebrities whose styles were at least five years out of date, were three chairs upholstered in a faded velvet. Each station boasted a large, ornate mirror that reflected the soft, diffused light streaming in from the rain-streaked window. Today, only one chair was occupied, by Mrs. Higgins, a regular who was currently having her blue rinse topped up. Evelyn Rose Carter, armed with her trusty scissors and a weary smile, emerged from the back room, hoping that Agnes hadn't come in with another of her "earth-mother" inspired requests. The last time, it had involved Evelyn trying to sculpt Agnes's hair into the shape of a mushroom, and she still hadn't recovered.
