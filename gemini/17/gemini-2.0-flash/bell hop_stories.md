Okay, here's a story opening and setting:

**Setting:** The opulent, and slightly faded, Grand Astoria Hotel. It stands like a wedding cake gone slightly stale on the edge of the shimmering Atlantic in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The year is 1957. The carpets are a plush, if slightly worn, crimson, and the air perpetually smells of expensive perfume trying to cover up the lingering scent of stale cigarette smoke and yesterday's champagne. The lobby is dominated by a massive crystal chandelier, which, on its best days, throws dazzling rainbows across the marble floor, but more often than not, just looks heavy and in need of a good dusting.

**Opening:**

The brass buttons on Bartholomew "Bart" Fitzgerald's bellhop uniform gleamed dully under the strained illumination of the Grand Astoria's elevator, reflecting a distorted image of his anxious face. He adjusted his cap, the thin fabric doing little to hide the way his brow furrowed with concentration. The elevator groaned its way upwards, each mechanical hiccup echoing in the otherwise silent cabin. He chewed on his bottom lip, a nervous habit he'd tried, and mostly failed, to break since starting the job at the Grand Astoria.

"Fourth floor," a disembodied voice, crackling through the ancient speaker system, announced, and the doors wheezed open. Bart straightened his shoulders, plastering on the practiced, slightly vacant, smile he reserved for guests who hadnâ€™t yet tipped. Tonight, though, that smile felt like a lead weight pulling at his cheeks. He clutched the worn leather handle of his bellhop cart, the weight of it a familiar comfort against the unsettling knot in his stomach. Tonight wasn't just about tips. Tonight was about survival.
