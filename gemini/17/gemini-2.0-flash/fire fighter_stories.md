## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The humid, choking air of late August hung heavy over New Orleans' French Quarter. The wrought-iron balconies, usually overflowing with tourists, were draped in a ghostly silence, broken only by the mournful wail of a distant ambulance. The scent of fried beignets and stale beer, usually so prominent, was now masked by the acrid tang of smoke and the lingering smell of diesel fuel. The sun, a malevolent orange eye in the smoky haze, threatened to bake the city alive.

**Story Opening:**

Sergeant Evangeline "Evie" Broussard slammed the truck door shut, the metal protesting with a groan that echoed her own exhaustion. Sweat plastered her dark curls to her forehead, streaking her dirt-stained face. The heat radiating off the crumbling brick building in front of her was almost palpable, even from fifty feet away. St. Louis Cathedral, a beacon of white amidst the growing chaos, seemed to shrink under the oppressive sky.

"Damn it, Evie," Captain Dubois barked, his voice barely audible over the roar of the hoses and the frantic shouts of other firefighters. "Get your team inside! Third floor, south side! We've got reports of a trapped resident. Old lady, can't move well."

Evie adjusted her helmet, the weight suddenly feeling unbearable. Trapped resident. Old lady. Those words were a cold stone in her gut. Taking a deep breath, she gripped her axe.

"Let's go," she ordered her team, her voice hoarse but resolute. "Let's get her out." She charged towards the inferno, the familiar burn on her skin a grim reminder of what awaited her inside. Tonight, the French Quarter was burning, and Evangeline Broussard was going to do everything in her power to stop it.
