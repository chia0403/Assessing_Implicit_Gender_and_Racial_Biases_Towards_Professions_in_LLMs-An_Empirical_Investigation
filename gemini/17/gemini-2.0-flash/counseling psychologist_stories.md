## Story Opening:

The buzzing of the fluorescent lights in Dr. Eleanor Rose Thorne’s small, windowless office seemed to amplify her own inner hum of anxiety. Outside, the November wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the old glass of the building and probably chasing the last of the golden leaves off the skeletal trees in the parking lot. Eleanor hated this time of year. It always felt like everything was slowly, inevitably dying.

She took a slow, deliberate sip of lukewarm chamomile tea, the paper cup crinkling slightly under her trembling fingers. Five minutes until Mrs. Periwinkle arrived. Mrs. Periwinkle, with her meticulously coiffed silver hair, her perpetually pursed lips, and her unwavering belief that Eleanor was single-handedly responsible for the decline of modern society. Eleanor exhaled, the steam barely visible in the chilly air. Today, more than usual, she needed all the patience she could muster.

The buzzer on her desk shrieked, jolting her. Time to face the music. Or, more accurately, the carefully orchestrated symphony of complaints and thinly veiled judgments that was a typical session with Mrs. Periwinkle. Eleanor smoothed down the front of her navy blue cardigan, plastered a professional (and hopefully convincing) smile on her face, and reached for the intercom.

"Send her in, Brenda," she said, her voice a touch higher than usual.

**Setting:**

Eleanor’s office is located on the second floor of a tired-looking brick building on the outskirts of Hemlock Hollow, Pennsylvania. The building houses a motley collection of small businesses: a tax preparation service, a struggling real estate agency, and a small law office specializing in wills and estates. The overall atmosphere is one of quiet desperation and faded grandeur.

Eleanor's office itself is sparsely furnished. A worn, comfortable armchair sits opposite a slightly-too-large, mahogany desk that dominates the small room. A framed diploma from the University of Pennsylvania hangs askew on the wall, struggling to lend an air of legitimacy to the space. A small bookcase crammed with psychology textbooks and self-help guides sits in one corner. The walls are painted a neutral beige, a color chosen more for its supposed calming effect than its aesthetic appeal. The only personal touches are a small, slightly faded photograph of Eleanor's grandparents on her desk and a single, struggling spider plant perched precariously on the windowsill. The air always smells faintly of dust and chamomile tea.
