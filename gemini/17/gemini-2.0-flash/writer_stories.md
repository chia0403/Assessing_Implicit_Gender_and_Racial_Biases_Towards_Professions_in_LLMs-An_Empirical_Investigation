## Story Opening & Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The rhythmic click of the typewriter keys was the only sound breaking the oppressive silence of the storm. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, clawing at the shutters of the old lighthouse with relentless fury. Rain hammered against the thick glass, blurring the already treacherous view of the churning Atlantic. Elias Thorne leaned closer, his eyes strained in the dim glow of the single desk lamp, the amber light catching the deep lines etched into his forehead. He chewed on the end of his pen, the nib digging into his lower lip, a nervous habit he’d never quite managed to shake. He'd been staring at the same sentence for the past hour, the words mocking him with their inherent blandness: "The sea was angry that day." God, how cliché. He crumpled the page with a frustrated sigh, the sound swallowed by the tempest raging beyond the walls. Another dead end. Another wasted day.

**Setting:**

The story is set within the isolated, and slightly dilapidated, lighthouse on the fictional island of North Point, located off the coast of Maine. The lighthouse, constructed in the late 1800s, has been automated for years, making the keeper's quarters available for rent to artists and writers seeking solitude. The interior is spartan but functional, with thick stone walls, echoing chambers, and a spiral staircase that winds all the way up to the lamp room. The furniture is a mix of antique pieces and more modern, utilitarian additions. The air is perpetually damp and carries the faint, metallic scent of the ocean. North Point itself is a rugged island, sparsely populated, with dramatic cliffs, windswept beaches, and a history steeped in local folklore and whispered tales of shipwrecks and forgotten tragedies.
