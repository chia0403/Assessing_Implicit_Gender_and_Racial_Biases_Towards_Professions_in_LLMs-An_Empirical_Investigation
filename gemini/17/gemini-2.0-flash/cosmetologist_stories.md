The jingle of the antique bell above the door always made Eloise Magnolia Bloom sigh. It wasn’t a happy sigh, mind you. More like a preparatory sigh, the kind you expelled before plunging your hands elbow-deep into lukewarm dishwater. Today, the bell announced Mrs. Henderson, her bi-weekly appointment for a "scorch and set," as Eloise, with a roll of her hazel eyes, secretly called it.

Eloise Magnolia Bloom, cosmetologist extraordinaire and owner of Bloom Beauty & Wellness, tightened the belt of her embroidered linen smock. She loved her small salon, nestled in the heart of Havenwood, a quaint, if slightly suffocating, town in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Havenwood was all antique shops, bake sales, and whispered gossip over overflowing plates of sweet tea at Millie’s Diner. The town was picturesque, certainly, but also stagnant. Eloise, who dreamed of sleek bobs and bold colors, was largely limited to perms, rinse-outs, and the occasional eyebrow wax.

Bloom Beauty & Wellness, despite its grand name, was really just one sun-drenched room. Light streamed through the large bay window, illuminating the vintage barber chair, the chrome hood dryer that looked like a prop from a forgotten sci-fi film, and the shelves crammed with products – from organic lavender hand cream (a concession to the "Wellness" part of the business) to tubs of bright pink hair wax she kept hidden in the back, hoping against hope someone, *anyone*, would request it. Outside, the gentle rumble of cicadas filled the humid summer air, a constant, droning reminder of the predictable rhythm of life in Havenwood. Eloise, dusting the already spotless countertop, braced herself. Mrs. Henderson was here, and with her, another two hours of small talk about the weather, the price of blueberries at Farmer McGregor’s stand, and the scandalous sight of young Timmy Abernathy sporting ripped jeans.
