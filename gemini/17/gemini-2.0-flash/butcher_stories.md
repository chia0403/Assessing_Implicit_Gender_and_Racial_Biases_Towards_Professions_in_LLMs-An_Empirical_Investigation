The smell of sawdust and iron-rich blood clung to Arthur Bertram Peabody like a second skin. It was a scent he hadn't noticed for years, as ubiquitous and unremarkable to him as the rustle of the wind through the plane trees that lined Elm Street. Outside, the late October sun cast long, skeletal shadows, painting the brick facades of Harrow Creek a vibrant crimson. Inside, Peabody & Sons, Purveyors of Fine Meats, was a dim, cool cave of gleaming steel and marbled flesh.

Arthur Bertram Peabody, his hands gnarled and calloused from decades of wielding cleavers and honing knives, wiped his brow with the back of his forearm, leaving a streak of tallowy grime across his forehead. He’d been up since four, breaking down a side of beef that had arrived fresh from the Miller farm. Now, at nearly noon, the lunch rush was trickling in – Mrs. Henderson with her precise instructions for the perfect pot roast, young Timmy Olsen, sent by his mother for a pound of sausage for tomorrow’s spaghetti.

Harrow Creek, nestled deep in the Catskill Mountains, was the kind of town where everybody knew everybody, and Arthur knew them all, and their meat preferences besides. Generations had come and gone through his shop, their stories intertwined with the aroma of curing hams and the rhythmic thud of his cleaver. He'd seen babies teethe on pig ears, brides-to-be order lamb chops for their celebratory dinners, and bereaved families seek comfort in a comforting stew.

But today, there was a disquiet in the air, heavier than the usual chill seeping in from the mountains. A nervousness prickled at the back of Arthur’s neck, a feeling he hadn't experienced since the Great Flood of '87. Something was different, something unsettling, and it wasn't just the unseasonably large crows that had been circling the town all morning.
