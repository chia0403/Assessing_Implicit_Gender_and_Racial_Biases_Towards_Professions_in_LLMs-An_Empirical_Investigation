## Story Opening:

The relentless drumming of rain against the glass of The Grand Meridian Hotel threatened to drown out the soft jazz tinkling from the lobby’s speakers. Reginald Thornton, crisply uniformed and eternally composed, barely registered it. He was too busy mentally rearranging the seating chart for Mrs. Van Derlyn’s charity gala, a task akin to herding cats through a hurricane. A guest, a harried-looking man with a perpetually wilting tie, approached the concierge desk.

"Thornton, right?" the man barked, barely making eye contact. "I need a table. Tonight. Something…romantic. Somewhere…quiet."

Reginald raised a perfectly sculpted eyebrow. "Certainly, sir. May I inquire as to your preferred cuisine and ambience?"

The man fidgeted. "Doesn't matter. Just…magic. Make some magic happen, Thornton. And I'm running late."

Reginald's polite smile remained fixed, but a silent sigh escaped his lips. Magic. Everyone wanted magic. Especially in the pouring rain, in a city that felt more like a soggy battlefield than a haven for romance. He glanced at the reservations book, a leather-bound tome that held the key to countless culinary dreams and disastrous dates. Tonight, it seemed, he'd have to pull something extraordinary from the hat.

## Setting:

The Grand Meridian Hotel dominates the skyline of New Birmingham, a city built on steel and now attempting to reinvent itself as a hub for art and innovation. The hotel itself is a monument to both eras, a towering art deco structure that has been painstakingly renovated to include modern amenities while preserving its historical charm. Gleaming marble floors reflect the opulent chandeliers that hang from the vaulted ceiling. Brass accents and plush velvet seating add to the air of old-world luxury.

Located in the heart of the Theatre District, the hotel bustles with tourists, business travelers, and local socialites alike. Its proximity to renowned restaurants, upscale boutiques, and world-class performance venues makes it a prime location. Despite the city's ongoing struggles with urban decay and economic disparity, The Grand Meridian remains a beacon of elegance, a sanctuary where guests can temporarily escape the harsh realities outside its gilded doors. Reginald Thornton, more than anyone, is tasked with maintaining that illusion.
