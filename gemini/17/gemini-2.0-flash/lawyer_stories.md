The rain hammered against the floor-to-ceiling windows of Eleanor Vance’s office, mimicking the relentless drumming in her chest. Outside, Seattle was a blurry, grey impressionistic painting, the Space Needle poking through the fog like a silver needle aimed at the heavens.

Her reflection stared back at her from the dark glass, a woman with sharp cheekbones, a severe bob that framed a determined jaw, and eyes that had seen more than their fair share of injustice. She was used to pressure, used to high-stakes cases, used to the relentless scrutiny that came with being one of Seattle’s most sought-after lawyers. But this… this was different. This was personal.
