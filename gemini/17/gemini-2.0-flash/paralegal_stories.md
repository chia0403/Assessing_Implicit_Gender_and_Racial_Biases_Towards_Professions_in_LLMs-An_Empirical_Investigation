**Opening:**

The fluorescent lights of Silverman, Davies, and Klein hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Claire Harding's Thursday night. She squinted at the overflowing file, the manila folder practically screaming at her. “Anderson v. GlobalTech,” it proclaimed in bold, black letters, a title that had haunted her for weeks. Amelia sighed, the scent of stale coffee and legal jargon clinging to the air around her. Outside, the city rumbled on, oblivious to the mountains of discovery requests and depositions that awaited her attention. A siren wailed in the distance, a lonely cry swallowed by the urban cacophony. She rubbed her tired eyes, the faint imprint of her glasses leaving red marks on the bridge of her nose. Just one more hour, she told herself, just one more hour and then blissful, glorious sleep. But she knew it was a lie. One more hour would probably just lead to another. This case was a bottomless pit, and Amelia was precariously close to falling in.

**Setting:**

Amelia's workspace was a testament to organized chaos. Her cubicle, located on the bustling 8th floor of Silverman, Davies, and Klein’s downtown Chicago office, was crammed with towers of legal documents. Stacks of post-it notes, color-coded by case and deadline, clung to her monitor like tenacious vines. A half-eaten granola bar lay next to a mug emblazoned with the sarcastic slogan "I'm a paralegal. What's your superpower?" Tacky motivational posters, courtesy of the firm's HR department, hung askew, their empty promises of "Synergy" and "Innovation" mocking her late-night solitude. Beyond her cubicle wall, she could hear the faint hum of the server room and the occasional muffled conversation from the few other souls still toiling away. The building itself was a sleek, modern glass and steel structure, overlooking Millennium Park, a glittering jewel box amidst the urban sprawl. But tonight, the park was shrouded in darkness, its beauty obscured by the relentless pursuit of justice (or at least, billable hours).
