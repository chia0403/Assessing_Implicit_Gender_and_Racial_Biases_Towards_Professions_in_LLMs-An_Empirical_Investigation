Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a story featuring a nutritionist named Eloise Evelyn Albright:

**Setting:**

The story opens on a blustery Tuesday morning in the small, coastal town of Port Blossom, Maine. The sky is a mottled grey, threatening rain, and the salty air bites at exposed skin. The protagonist, Eloise, works in a renovated Victorian house painted a cheerful (and slightly incongruous) sunshine yellow. The sign hanging above the porch reads: "Eloise Albright Nutrition: Nourish Your Life." Inside, the office is cozy and inviting, with exposed brick, soft lighting, and the aroma of herbal tea perpetually brewing in the waiting area. Jars of nuts, seeds, and dried fruits line the shelves, a testament to Eloise's belief in whole, unprocessed foods.

**Opening:**

The insistent ring of the antique rotary phone jolted Eloise Evelyn Albright from her half-formed daydream of sun-ripened tomatoes and basil. She'd been mentally planning the summer's vegetable garden, a small patch behind her office that provided her with a surprising amount of produce. With a sigh, she wiped her hands on the floral apron covering her organic cotton dress and plucked the receiver off its cradle.

"Eloise Albright Nutrition, Eloise speaking," she answered, her voice warm and professional, the kind of voice that immediately put her clients at ease, even when she was about to suggest they trade their beloved donuts for a bowl of steel-cut oats.

"Eloise, darling, it's me, Mildred," a breathy, slightly panicked voice crackled on the other end. "I need you. Desperately. It's about the clam bake."

Eloise's stomach did a little flip-flop. The annual Port Blossom Clam Bake was a town institution, a veritable festival of butter, lobster, and questionable cholesterol levels. And Mildred Butterfield, the event's organizer and notorious social butterfly, was precisely the type of client Eloise usually tried to politely avoid.
