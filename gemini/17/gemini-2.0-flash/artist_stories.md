## Story Opening:

The salt-laced wind whipped strands of auburn hair across Annelise Marguerite Dubois' face as she wrestled with her easel, its wooden legs stubbornly refusing to stay put on the cliff's edge. Below, the churning Atlantic gnawed relentlessly at the rugged coastline, a symphony of roars and crashes that both inspired and intimidated her. Annelise gritted her teeth, pushing a loose strand of hair behind her ear with the back of a paint-stained hand. Damn the wind! It was almost as temperamental as her muse. But the light... oh, the light! This specific, fleeting moment, when the setting sun bled crimson and gold across the turbulent water, transforming the grey waves into liquid fire, was what she lived for. This was the heart of her latest piece, the one she hoped would finally break her out of the doldrums of predictable, picturesque landscapes and into something trulyâ€¦ raw.

## Setting:

The story opens on a windswept, craggy cliffside on the coast of **County Clare, Ireland**. The time is late afternoon, the air thick with the smell of salt and seaweed. The sun is beginning to set, casting long, dramatic shadows and bathing the landscape in vibrant hues of orange, red, and gold. In the distance, the Aran Islands sit like ghostly sentinels on the horizon. The weather is volatile, with patches of blue sky vying for dominance against dark, brooding clouds. The sounds of crashing waves and the mournful cry of gulls are constant, creating an atmosphere that is both beautiful and unsettling. The ground is uneven and treacherous, scattered with loose rocks and tufts of hardy, wind-battered grass. It is a place of wild beauty, both inspiring and unforgiving, and it perfectly reflects the internal landscape of Annelise Marguerite Dubois.
