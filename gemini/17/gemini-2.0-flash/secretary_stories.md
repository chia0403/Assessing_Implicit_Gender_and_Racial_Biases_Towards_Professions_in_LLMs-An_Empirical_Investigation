**Opening:**

The rhythmic clatter of Lucille Mae Harding’s vintage Underwood typewriter filled the otherwise silent air of the Northwood Law Offices. It was a sound she found oddly comforting, a steady pulse in the chaotic heart of her day. Outside, the Chicago wind howled, a bitter January tempest that rattled the windowpanes and sent shivers down her spine, despite the layers of her wool cardigan. She adjusted her spectacles, the chain clicking softly against the pearls she wore – a single strand, a gift from her late grandmother – and meticulously corrected a typo in Mr. Northwood's brief on the Peterson vs. Peterson divorce case. Divorces, she thought with a sigh, were always messy business. Just like life itself.

**Setting:**

The Northwood Law Offices occupied a prime corner suite on the 27th floor of the Art Deco masterpiece that was the Marquette Building in downtown Chicago. The office, however, felt less like a symbol of progress and more like a relic of a bygone era. Thick, mahogany doors, stained glass accents depicting scenes of justice, and portraits of stern-faced founders dominated the space. Lucille’s desk, a hulking piece of dark oak, stood just outside Mr. Northwood’s private office. It was strategically positioned to allow her to monitor the comings and goings of clients, lawyers, and the occasional confused visitor. The room was illuminated by a large, ornate chandelier and the pale winter light filtering through the frosted glass windows, which offered a breathtaking, albeit bleak, view of Lake Michigan. A perpetually overflowing in-tray, a stack of manila folders threatening to topple, and a half-empty cup of lukewarm coffee were permanent fixtures on Lucille’s desk, testaments to the endless stream of tasks that filled her days. The scent of old paper, aged leather-bound law books, and a faint whiff of Mr. Northwood’s pipe tobacco permeated the air, creating a distinctly musty and somewhat intimidating atmosphere.
