## Opening & Setting:

The relentless Georgia sun beat down on the asphalt shingles, turning them into shimmering, heat-soaked torture devices under Archibald "Archie" Finch's worn work boots. He squinted, wiping the sweat that stung his eyes with the back of his calloused hand, leaving a greasy streak on his forehead. Another nail, another tap, another whisper of prayer that this roof wouldn’t be the death of him.

He was perched precariously on the gable of the old Victorian house, clinging to the steep incline with the practiced ease of a mountain goat… a very hot, very sweaty, very middle-aged mountain goat. Below him, the quaint town of Harmony Creek simmered in the summer heat haze. Honeysuckle vines draped themselves over picket fences, and the air hummed with the lazy drone of cicadas. 

Harmony Creek was postcard-perfect, all clapboard houses and manicured lawns, a place where the biggest excitement was Mrs. Gable's prize-winning petunias and the occasional sighting of a particularly fluffy squirrel. But beneath the saccharine sweetness, Archie knew, lurked secrets like rot in the rafters, and he was getting the distinct feeling he was about to uncover one.
