The hum of the Collins R-390A receiver was the lullaby of Arthur Reginald Finchâ€™s life. It resonated deep in his bones, a comforting vibration that drowned out the static crackle of loneliness that often plagued his small existence. Arthur, at 58, had dedicated the better part of four decades to the innards of radios, diagnosing their ills and coaxing them back to life, a physician of the airwaves.

The setting was his workshop, a claustrophobic extension built onto the back of his modest bungalow in the sleepy coastal town of Port Blossom, Oregon. Sunlight, already weak in late October, struggled to penetrate the grime-streaked windows, casting the room in a perpetual twilight. Benches crammed with soldering irons, oscilloscopes, and dismantled radios were the dominant features, their surfaces littered with wires, resistors, and vacuum tubes like metallic confetti. The air was thick with the scent of flux, ozone, and dust motes dancing in the meager light beams. Bookshelves, overflowing with dog-eared manuals and schematics, lined one wall, threatening to topple onto the unsuspecting. The only touch of personality, aside from a framed, faded photograph of Arthur in his navy uniform from his younger days, was a battered, wind-chapped seashell resting on top of a particularly archaic oscilloscope. It was a reminder of the vast, powerful ocean that lay just beyond the hum of his radio world, a world he rarely ventured into.
