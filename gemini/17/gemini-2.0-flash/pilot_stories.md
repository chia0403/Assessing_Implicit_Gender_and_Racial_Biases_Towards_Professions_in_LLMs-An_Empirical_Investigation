The harsh Alaskan wind bit at the canvas of Isabella "Izzy" Rodriguez's makeshift hangar, a flimsy affair cobbled together from salvaged airplane parts and sheer stubbornness. Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of aviation fuel, oil, and the faint, lingering scent of Izzy's grandmother's lavender soap. It was a scent incongruous with the rugged wilderness surrounding her, but a comforting reminder of a life before, a life back in sunny California that felt a lifetime ago.

Outside, the world was a canvas of white and gray. A bruised sky pressed down on the frozen tundra, obscuring the distant, jagged peaks of the Brooks Range. The only signs of life were the occasional raven circling overhead and the faint, almost imperceptible tracks of caribou snaking through the snow. This was Coldfoot, Alaska â€“ less a town, more a collection of hardy souls clinging to the edge of civilization, drawn here by the promise of the haul road and the whispers of gold that still echoed in the mountains.

Izzy, bundled in a thick, patched-up Carhartt jacket and wool beanie, cursed under her breath as she wrestled with a stubborn bolt on the cowling of her beloved Cessna 185, nicknamed "The Raven." Her breath plumed out in white clouds, momentarily obscuring the view of the mountains outside. Today was a bad day to be tinkering, but Old Man Hemlock needed his medicine drop, and Izzy was the only one crazy enough to fly in this weather. The responsibility weighed heavy on her shoulders, a constant reminder of the crucial role she played in this isolated community. And, if she was honest with herself, a role she wouldn't trade for anything.
