## Story Opening & Setting

**Setting:** The perpetually damp, salt-laced air of Astoria, Oregon, clung to everything, even the perpetually squeaking hinges of Dr. Penelope Ainsworth’s tiny, second-floor dental office. Rain lashed against the panoramic window, blurring the view of the Columbia River churning angrily. The rhythmic clang of the buoy bell offshore was a constant, melancholic hum. Inside, the air was thick with the slightly sweet, vaguely antiseptic smell of fluoride and fear.

**Story Opening:**

Penelope Ainsworth, DDS, better known to the townsfolk as simply "Dr. Ainsworth," stared with grim fascination at the X-ray shimmering on the lightbox. A dark, insidious shadow gnawed at the roots of young Billy O’Malley’s molar – something far beyond a standard cavity. It looked...wrong. Deeply, profoundly wrong. It resembled, disturbingly, a miniature, calcified octopus clinging to the bone. Penelope swallowed, the familiar taste of worry – a sharp, metallic tang – coating her tongue. She'd seen her fair share of dental oddities in her twenty years of practice in this isolated coastal town, but nothing, absolutely nothing, like this. This wasn't just decay. This was something else entirely. And the growing sense of unease in her gut told her it was something far more sinister than she could ever have imagined.
