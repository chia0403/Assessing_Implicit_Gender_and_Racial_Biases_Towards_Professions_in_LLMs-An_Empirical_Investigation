## Story Opening:

The wrench slipped, biting a chunk out of Eliza Mae "EJ" Jones's knuckle. She cursed, a colorful, muttered string of profanity punctuated by the rhythmic clang of metal on metal. Wiping the grease-stained sweat from her brow with the back of her arm, EJ squinted into the engine bay of the '67 Ford Mustang. It was a mess. A beautiful, vintage mess, but a mess nonetheless. She'd been battling this stubborn beast for three days, chasing a phantom misfire that taunted her skills and threatened to drain the already thin profit margin on the restoration.

"Almost there," she muttered to the Mustang, as much to reassure herself as the car. "Almost there, you cantankerous old mule."

The smell of gasoline and burnt oil hung heavy in the air, a familiar, comforting aroma to EJ. It was the smell of home, of heritage, of sweat and ingenuity. It was the smell of Jones Garage.

## Setting:

**Jones Garage** was a sprawling, ramshackle affair located just outside the sleepy town of Harmony Creek, nestled in the rolling hills of West Virginia. The main garage building was a Quonset hut, weathered and patched with mismatched panels, its corrugated steel roof groaning under the weight of years of neglect. Inside, the concrete floor was stained with a Jackson Pollock-esque splatter of every fluid imaginable: oil, coolant, transmission fluid, brake fluid, and even the occasional spilled cup of coffee.

Sunlight streamed in through a large, perpetually open bay door, illuminating a chaotic landscape of car parts, tools hanging precariously on pegboards, and half-finished projects. A battered cherry-red toolbox, passed down through generations of Jones mechanics, stood sentinel next to each work bay.

Outside, a graveyard of rusted vehicles stretched across the back lot, a testament to EJ's skill (she could fix almost anything) and the sometimes-fatal consequences of mountain driving. Old tires lay stacked like forgotten monuments, and weeds stubbornly pushed through the cracks in the asphalt, reclaiming the land inch by inch. A hand-painted sign, faded and peeling, hung precariously above the entrance: "Jones Garage - If we can't fix it, it ain't broke (probably)."
