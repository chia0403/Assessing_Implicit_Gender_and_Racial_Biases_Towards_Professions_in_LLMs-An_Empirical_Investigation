## The Story Opening:

Rain lashed against the windows of the office, mirroring the storm brewing in Albert Humphrey’s stomach. He stared at the spreadsheet on his monitor, the numbers swimming like restless tadpoles in a murky pond. Profit margins, already thin, were evaporating faster than morning mist. He’d been staring at this same page for the past six hours, fuelled by lukewarm coffee and the gnawing fear that he was about to deliver a fatal blow to Mrs. Willowby's beloved Tea Room. Albert sighed, his breath fogging momentarily on the cool glass of his spectacles. He massaged his temples, the dull ache there a constant companion these days. He knew, with a certainty that chilled him to the bone, that this wasn't just a financial problem. Something else was going on, something far more…peculiar.

## The Setting:

Albert Humphrey’s office occupied the top floor of a converted Victorian townhouse in the quaint seaside town of Seabrook. The building, affectionately nicknamed "The Pigeon Coop" by its tenants, was a hodgepodge of mismatched architectural styles and questionable DIY repairs. Albert's office itself was cramped, dominated by a large, oak desk overflowing with paperwork and a disconcertingly orange swivel chair that creaked ominously with every movement. Bookshelves crammed with accounting textbooks and tax law manuals lined one wall, while another was adorned with a framed picture of Albert's prize-winning begonia, Mildred. A single, bare bulb cast a harsh, unflattering light on the room, highlighting the dust motes dancing in the air and the overall impression of organized chaos. Outside, the charming, albeit slightly faded, glory of Seabrook was being hammered by the storm. The normally vibrant promenade was deserted, the colorful beach huts shuttered tight against the wind and rain. Even the seagulls, usually so bold, had sought shelter, leaving the town to the mercy of the elements. The salty tang of the sea, normally a refreshing balm, was now tinged with a hint of something…else. Something unsettling.
