The hum of the Cavitron scaler was Amelia Rose Hawthorne's morning lullaby. It wasn't a particularly melodious lullaby, admittedly, but after six years of scraping away plaque and polishing enamel, it was a familiar comfort, a sonic backdrop to her carefully choreographed dance around a patient's gums. Today, the unfortunate recipient of this percussive poem was Mrs. Higgins, a sweet, elderly woman with a penchant for hard candies and a remarkable accumulation of tartar build-up on her lower anteriors.

Amelia leaned in, her magnified visor giving her an almost alien appearance, and expertly maneuvered the vibrating tip around a particularly stubborn patch of calculus. Outside, the late October sunlight dappled the tree-lined street of Willow Creek, Ohio. Ameliaâ€™s corner office, nestled in the charmingly rustic Hawthorne Dental Clinic (a legacy practice started by her great-grandfather), offered a picturesque view of falling leaves in vibrant shades of crimson and gold. It should have been a scene of bucolic tranquility, a perfect antidote to the incessant whirring, but a faint unease had settled over Amelia all morning. Perhaps it was the impending Halloween festivities, a holiday she usually enjoyed with childish enthusiasm, but this year felt different, tinged with a subtle, unexplained apprehension.

Willow Creek itself was a town steeped in history and, some whispered, a touch of the uncanny. Founded in the early 1800s, it boasted a charming Main Street lined with antique shops, cozy cafes, and the aforementioned Hawthorne Dental Clinic, a three-story Victorian house painted a cheerful shade of buttercup yellow. Beneath the quaint facade, however, ran a current of quiet secrets and long-held traditions. Amelia, despite being a Hawthorne through and through, couldn't quite shake the feeling that she was missing a vital piece of Willow Creek's puzzle, a piece that whispered just beyond the reach of her everyday reality. And today, the whispers seemed a little louder, a little closer.
