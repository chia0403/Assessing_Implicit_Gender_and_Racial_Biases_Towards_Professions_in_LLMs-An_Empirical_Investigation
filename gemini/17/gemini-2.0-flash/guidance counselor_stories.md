**Opening:**

The clock on the wall of Eleanor Beatrice Ainsworth's office ticked with a relentless rhythm that mirrored the anxiety churning in her stomach. 2:57 PM. Three more minutes until her last appointment of the day. Three more minutes until she could escape the cacophony of teenage angst and try, for a brief moment, to quiet her own. She adjusted her glasses, a nervous habit she’d developed over years of squinting at dimly lit graduation ceremonies, and reread the student's file on her desk: Daniel "Danny" Miller, sophomore, exhibiting signs of…withdrawal.

**Setting:**

Eleanor Ainsworth’s office, Room 204, was located in the heart of Northwood High, a sprawling brick building that had seen better days. Sunlight, filtered through the grimy window overlooking the football field, cast long, weak shadows across the room. Eleanor had attempted to inject some warmth into the sterile space with a carefully curated collection of motivational posters – "Dream Big," "Reach for the Stars," "Every Day is a New Beginning" – though she suspected the students mostly found them ironic. A worn, floral-patterned armchair sat opposite her desk, strategically positioned to appear inviting, despite the faint stain of spilled soda that marred its armrest. Stacks of college brochures, course catalogs, and standardized test pamphlets threatened to topple from the overflowing shelves behind her, a visual testament to the constant pressure to succeed that permeated the school. The air, thick with the scent of disinfectant and stale coffee, hummed with the low thrum of fluorescent lights, a sound that Eleanor often found both comforting and deeply unsettling.
