The bell above the door of "The Willow Creek Pharmacy" tinkled a cheerful, almost mocking, melody in the pre-dawn gloom. Agnes Abigail Abernathy, her auburn hair already pulled back into a severe bun despite the early hour of 5:30 AM, didn't return the cheer. Her shoulders, perpetually slumped forward from years of hunching over prescriptions, only sagged further.

Willow Creek, nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, was idyllic in postcards and tourist brochures. Agnes, however, knew the reality. Its picture-perfect charm often masked a persistent undercurrent of loneliness and quiet desperation, fueled by dwindling industries and the slow creep of progress threatening to swallow the town whole.

The setting sun, or rather, the promise of it, painted the sky in hues of bruised purple and charcoal grey. A faint, almost imperceptible mist clung to the narrow Main Street, lending an ethereal quality to the quaint, brick buildings. Across the street, the bakery, "Mama Rosa's," was just starting to stir, the warm glow of its lights a stark contrast to the chilling dampness that permeated Agnes' bones.

Agnes shuffled behind the counter, the linoleum cold beneath her sensible shoes. The pharmacy itself was a relic. Wooden shelves lined the walls, overflowing with amber glass bottles, faded medical charts, and the comforting, if slightly musty, aroma of herbs and time. It was a place steeped in history, a place Agnes had inherited from her grandfather, a place she was fiercely, almost irrationally, determined to keep alive, even if it meant starting her day before the birds.
