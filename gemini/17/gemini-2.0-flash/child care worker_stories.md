The stale scent of microwaved mac and cheese hung heavy in the air, clinging to the brightly colored walls of the "Tiny Treasures" playroom. Inside, chaos reigned: a symphony of squawks, giggles, and the rhythmic thud of small bodies colliding. It was just another Tuesday afternoon, and for Cordelia Beatrice Ainsworth, it was a test of her patience, her sanity, and the structural integrity of her sensible, waterproof footwear. Cordelia sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. Somewhere between the finger-painting disaster zone in the corner and the block tower threatening to topple like a miniature leaning tower of Pisa, she needed to locate little Timmy Millerâ€™s missing shoe. And prevent a meltdown, preferably her own.

**Setting:** "Tiny Treasures" Daycare Center, located in the bustling downtown area of Oakhaven. The building is a converted Victorian house, painted a cheerful, if slightly faded, yellow. The interior is a kaleidoscope of primary colors, designed to stimulate young minds, but often serving as a visual assault to exhausted childcare workers. The playroom is large, with worn-but-clean carpet, and divided into several activity areas: a reading nook with mismatched cushions, an art corner with easels and overflowing paint pots, a block building zone dominated by colorful plastic bricks, and a dramatic play area with a small stage and a trunk overflowing with costumes. Outside, a small, fenced-in playground boasts a swing set, a slide, and a sandbox that is currently more sand-less than sand.
