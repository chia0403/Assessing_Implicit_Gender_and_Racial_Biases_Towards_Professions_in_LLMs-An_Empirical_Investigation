The pre-dawn chill bit at Elias Thorne’s exposed skin as he wrestled his battered Ford pickup, affectionately nicknamed "Sparky," into a rut-filled parking space. Above him, the hulking silhouette of the abandoned textile mill loomed, a gothic monument to a bygone era, its skeletal windows gaping like vacant eyes. The air hung thick with the scent of damp brick and river mud, a familiar aroma that always managed to both repel and fascinate him.

Elias, a man whose calloused hands spoke more eloquently than his quiet voice, killed the engine, plunging the cab into a near-total darkness. He was a practical man, but even he couldn’t deny the oppressive atmosphere that clung to Blackwood Mill like a persistent fog. He was here on assignment from the Historical Society - tasked with assessing the feasibility of running power to the old administration building for a potential museum. It was a big job, a prestigious one, but something about the place made the hair on the back of his neck prickle. Blackwood Mill had been shuttered for decades, a silent witness to the rise and fall of the town, and some said, more than a few tragedies. Elias just hoped he could get the job done without adding to the mill's already grim history.
