Okay, here’s a story opening and setting featuring a physical therapist named:

**Main Character:** Genevieve Eleanor Ainsworth

**Opening and Setting:**

The humid Georgia air hung thick and heavy as Genevieve Eleanor Ainsworth wrestled with the clinic door, a stack of patient charts threatening to spill like a poorly built Jenga tower.  The aroma of chlorine from the nearby therapy pool mingled unpleasantly with the faint scent of antiseptic and stale coffee that perpetually clung to the walls of “Revitalize Rehabilitation Center.”  Genevieve, or Gen, as she preferred, sighed.  Another Monday morning, another parade of aching backs, stiff knees, and post-op shoulders.  The clock on the reception desk, a relic from the 1980s with a perpetually blinking ‘8,’ insisted it was already 8:05 AM. Mr. Henderson, notorious for his punctuality and his equally notorious complaints about the color of the therapy bands, was probably already fuming in the waiting room.

Gen shifted the charts, a wisp of her auburn hair escaping her messy bun and tickling her nose.  She pushed open the door, the bell above it jingling a tired, unenthusiastic greeting.  The waiting room was predictably sterile - beige walls, generic landscape prints, and the rhythmic drone of a daytime talk show emanating from a small television precariously balanced on a rolling cart.  And there he was, Mr. Henderson, his face a roadmap of wrinkles etched deeper by indignation, already tapping his foot impatiently.  This was going to be a *long* week.  But as Gen plastered on her most professional and encouraging smile, something about the usually meticulously arranged magazines on the coffee table caught her eye.  They were scattered, almost haphazardly, and one of them was opened to an article about… missing persons?  It was an odd choice for a waiting room curated mostly for articles on golf tips and arthritis remedies.  A flicker of unease, an unwelcome prickle on the back of her neck, broke through the routine.  Something felt…off.
