**Story Opening:**

The morning bit at Silas Blackwood's knuckles like a hungry wolf. He pulled his wool cap further down, the scent of pine needles and damp earth clinging to its fibers. The first rays of dawn, a bruised purple bleeding into a weak orange, barely penetrated the dense canopy overhead. The chainsaw, heavy and cold against his thigh, hummed softly as he tugged the starter cord. It sputtered, coughed, and then roared to life, a guttural promise echoing through the silent forest. Today was going to be a long day.

**Setting:**

The story is set in the heart of the Olympic National Forest in Washington state. The year is 1978. Towering Douglas firs and ancient Sitka spruces, their bark thick and gnarled with age, dominate the landscape. The air is perpetually damp and cool, thick with the smell of decaying wood and fertile earth. Mist hangs in the valleys, clinging to the ferns and moss that carpet the forest floor. Streams, swollen with meltwater, rush through the undergrowth, carving paths through the tangled roots. Remnants of past logging operations – stumps weathered gray and overgrown with vegetation – are scattered throughout, a testament to the generations who have worked these woods. The nearest town, Forks, is a small, isolated community, its economy almost entirely dependent on the timber industry.
