## Story Opening and Setting

**Setting:** The biting wind whipped off the Greenland Ice Sheet, stinging exposed skin and rattling the prefabricated walls of Research Station Delta. Inside, the air was thick with the recycled breath of a dozen scientists and the low hum of machinery. Neon lights flickered overhead, casting a sterile glow on the banks of monitors displaying seismic readings, atmospheric pressure, and ice core analysis charts. Outside, a perpetual twilight reigned, the weak Arctic sun forever struggling to pierce the heavy cloud cover. It was late October, and the long, dark winter had already tightened its grip.

**Opening:** Dr. Evelyn Rose Thorne ignored the insistent beeping of her phone, her brow furrowed in concentration as she stared at the holographic projection before her. The image, painstakingly constructed from weeks of ground-penetrating radar data, showed the geological formations beneath the ice, a chaotic jumble of rock and ancient riverbeds. She was so close, she could feel it. After years of searching, she was on the verge of confirming her hypothesis: a subterranean lake, untouched for millennia, potentially teeming with life unlike anything known on Earth.

The beeping persisted, louder this time. Evelyn sighed, the frustration evident on her face, and deactivated the projection. "What is it, Lars?" she asked, her voice tight with impatience.
