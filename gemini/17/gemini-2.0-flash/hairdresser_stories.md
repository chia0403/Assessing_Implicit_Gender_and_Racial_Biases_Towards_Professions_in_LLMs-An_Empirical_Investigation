The humid Shreveport air hung heavy and sweet with the scent of magnolias, seeping into the small brick building like a persistent ghost. Inside, under the buzzing fluorescent lights of “Southern Charm Salon,” Beatrice Eloise Dubois wielded her comb with the practiced grace of a seasoned sculptor. Sweat beaded on her brow despite the whirring of the overworked ceiling fan, and a stray auburn strand had escaped her carefully pinned-up bun.

Beatrice hated Saturdays. They were a chaotic symphony of chattering ladies, the cloying aroma of hairspray, and the constant ringing of the ancient rotary phone, all demanding her attention like restless children. Her station, tucked away in a corner amidst a jungle of rollers, perm solutions, and half-empty bottles of hair dye, felt like a sanctuary and a prison all at once.

Today’s victim – *er, client* – was Mrs. Delphine Hollingsworth, a woman whose hair resembled a tangled bird's nest and whose opinions rivaled its volume. Beatrice had spent the last twenty minutes untangling the web while politely nodding through a monologue about the scandalous new preacher at the First Baptist Church. Just as she was about to finally apply the first layer of Miss Clairol’s “Golden Sunrise Blonde,” the phone shrieked its insistent ring. Beatrice sighed, pinched the bridge of her nose, and prepared for another onslaught of Saturday madness.
