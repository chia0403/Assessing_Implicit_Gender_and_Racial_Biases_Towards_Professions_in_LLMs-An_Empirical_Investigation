Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a main character who is a Physician's Assistant:

**Story Opening:**

The biting wind whipped off Lake Michigan, stinging even through Amelia Grace Callahan's thickest scarf.  She cursed under her breath, already picturing the inevitable static cling that would plague her all afternoon.  Another day, another parade of sniffles, aches, and dubious Google diagnoses at the West Harbor Clinic. Usually, she loved the predictability, the small-town rhythms of checking in patients and relaying information to the clinic physician.  But today, a knot of unease had settled deep in her stomach, a feeling she couldn’t quite shake off, like a phantom limb throbbing with an unknown pain. Perhaps it was the cryptic voicemail left on her personal phone this morning, a low, raspy voice murmuring something about “the old agreement” and "consequences." Or maybe it was the way Mr. Henderson, the usually jovial butcher, had given her an unusually long, intense stare when she picked up her ground beef yesterday. Whatever it was, Amelia was operating on high alert, a feeling that was only amplified when her boss, Dr. Miller, informed her that he would be leaving early for a medical conference. The clinic was officially in her hands until closing, and she had the nagging suspicion that the day was about to take a sharp turn.

**Setting:**

The story takes place in the small, lakeside town of West Harbor, Wisconsin. The focal point of the opening is the **West Harbor Clinic**. It's a modest, single-story building with a brick facade, adorned with a sign featuring a stylized sailboat. Inside, the waiting room is cheerfully decorated with nautical-themed artwork, comfortable but worn armchairs, and a fish tank bubbling quietly in the corner. The examination rooms are functional and sterile, smelling faintly of antiseptic and the reassuring scent of pine cleaner. The overall atmosphere is one of comfortable familiarity and modest efficiency.  The clinic is located on the edge of the town's central square, allowing for easy access to local businesses like Mrs. Peterson's "Knit & Natter" yarn shop, the aforementioned butcher shop, and the charming but slightly dilapidated West Harbor library, where Amelia spends most of her free time. The town itself is nestled on the shores of Lake Michigan, its economy largely dependent on tourism during the summer months. In winter, however, West Harbor takes on a quieter, more introspective character, often blanketed in snow and swept by the lake's unforgiving winds.
