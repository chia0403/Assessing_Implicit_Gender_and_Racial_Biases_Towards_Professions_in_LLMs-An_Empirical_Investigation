## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The pre-dawn chill clung to the cracked asphalt of the I-40 West rest stop just outside of Oklahoma City. A lone, sickly fluorescent light buzzed over a cluster of rigs, casting long, skeletal shadows. The air smelled of stale diesel and burnt coffee, a familiar perfume for those who lived their lives on the long haul.

**Opening:**

The squeal of air brakes jolted Ezekiel "Zeke" Bartholomew awake. He grumbled, swatting at the threadbare blanket that covered him in the sleeper berth of his Kenworth W900. He wasn't sure how long he'd been out, maybe two, three hours max. The dispatcher was breathing down his neck to get to Albuquerque with that load of artisanal goat cheese before it started smelling like, well, actual goats. He squinted at the digital clock on the dashboard â€“ 4:17 AM. Great. Plenty of time to feel thoroughly miserable before the sun even considered making an appearance. Zeke wrestled himself out of the berth, the rusty springs groaning in protest. He reached for the thermos of lukewarm coffee on the dash, its dented surface a testament to countless miles and even more near-misses. He took a long, unsatisfying swig. Albuquerque and its pretentious goats awaited.
