## Story Opening:

The smell of burnt coffee and desperation hung thick in the air of the "Breakroom" at Global Solutions Inc. - a potent cocktail that Marcus Aurelius Thorne knew all too well. He swirled the dregs in his chipped ceramic mug, the lukewarm brown liquid mirroring the bleak landscape of his Q3 sales projections. Outside, the Denver skyline shimmered with promise, but inside, Marcus felt like he was staring into the abyss of another missed quota. The motivational posters plastered around the breakroom – "Reach for the Stars!" "Success is Just Around the Corner!" – mocked him with their saccharine optimism. He’d reached for the stars, alright. He’d just kept missing them.

This week, however, *had* to be different. This week, he *had* to close that deal with StellarTech. His mortgage depended on it. He swallowed the bitter coffee and the bitter truth: Marcus Aurelius Thorne, seasoned veteran and once-star salesman, was on thin ice. And the ice was cracking.
