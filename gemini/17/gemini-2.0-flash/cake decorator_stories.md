**Opening:**

A plume of powdered sugar erupted in a cloud around Seraphina Magnolia Bloom, obscuring her face in a ghostly white mask. She coughed, waving a hand erratically in front of her. “Blast it all, Beatrice!” she muttered, more to the air than anyone else. The ancient stand mixer, nicknamed Beatrice after her formidable Aunt Beatrice who gifted it to her, churned on, oblivious to the near-disaster it had just caused. Seraphina grabbed a damp cloth and scrubbed furiously at the sugary mess coating the counter, her already frazzled nerves threatening to snap.

**Setting:**

The year is 1928. Seraphina’s Cake Emporium, a small but charming bakery nestled on a cobblestone street in the heart of New Orleans' French Quarter, was her pride and joy. The scent of vanilla, cinnamon, and roasted pecans hung heavy in the air, a comforting balm that usually soothed her. Today, however, it only amplified the pressure. Sunlight streamed through the lace-curtained windows, illuminating the gleaming glass cases filled with meticulously crafted confections: miniature king cakes dusted in vibrant purple, green, and gold, decadent chocolate gateaux adorned with spun sugar roses, and towering wedding cakes embellished with intricate piping. The walls were painted a soft, buttery yellow, and a collection of antique cake stands and vintage cookie cutters lined the shelves, adding to the shop's whimsical charm. Outside, the sounds of street musicians and chattering tourists mingled with the rhythmic clatter of horse-drawn carriages, a constant reminder of the vibrant life that thrived just beyond her door. But inside, Seraphina felt utterly alone, the weight of expectations pressing down on her like a poorly constructed layer cake.
