## Story Opening:

The clatter of falling dominoes was a surprisingly soothing sound, a counterpoint to the gnawing anxiety that had settled in Leo Maxwell’s stomach. He hadn't touched the half-finished pattern in days, not since the first vague ache had surfaced in Mrs. Gable's left trapezius. Now, surrounded by the colorful plastic pieces, scattered like vibrant, fallen soldiers, Leo found himself strangely drawn to their potential for order, for a satisfying, predictable collapse.

He reached out, his fingers, usually so adept at palpating spinal misalignment, now clumsy as he tried to stand a tiny red domino on its end. It wobbled, threatened to fall, and Leo sighed. Maybe he should just pack it all up. Maybe he should just...

The shrill ring of the landline cut through his thoughts like a scalpel. He hesitated, dreading what he might hear. Every new patient felt like a loaded question these days, a potential carrier of the creeping fear that was slowly, inexorably, shutting down his practice. He knew he couldn't ignore it forever. He just wished he had a little more time to savor the quiet before the storm broke.

He picked up the phone. "Maxwell Chiropractic, Leo speaking."

## Setting:

Leo Maxwell's chiropractic office, "The Body Balance Center," was nestled in a converted Victorian house on Elm Street in the sleepy town of Havenwood, Massachusetts. The exterior, painted a cheerful robin's egg blue, was a stark contrast to the increasingly anxious atmosphere within. Sunlight streamed through the stained-glass window in the waiting room, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and the faded floral wallpaper.

Inside, the office was meticulously organized, a reflection of Leo’s desire to control the chaos he felt brewing within himself. Skeletons and anatomical charts adorned the walls, alongside framed certificates and awards. The examination room was equipped with a state-of-the-art chiropractic table, now gleaming and sterile, waiting for patients that were becoming increasingly scarce. The lingering scent of lavender oil, usually a comforting presence, now felt faintly artificial, a fragile shield against the encroaching dread.
