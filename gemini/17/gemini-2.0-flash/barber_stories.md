Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a barber as the main character:

**Setting:**

The humid, sticky air hung heavy over the port city of Galveston, Texas. It was late August, and the threat of another hurricane loomed on the horizon, mirroring the general unease clinging to the salt-tinged breeze. The year was 1935, and the Depression had sunk its teeth deep into the heart of the city, leaving a trail of boarded-up storefronts and weary faces in its wake. Within a block of the docks, a faded red, white, and blue barber pole stood sentinel outside "Art's Clippers & Shaves," a small, slightly dilapidated haven from the storms, both literal and figurative, that ravaged the outside world. Inside, the air smelled of bay rum, talcum powder, and the quiet dignity of tradition.

**Story Opening:**

Arthur Bartholomew "Art" Finch adjusted the worn leather strop affixed to his barber chair. The rhythmic *thwack-thwack-thwack* was a familiar comfort, a steady beat against the disquiet simmering in his stomach. The radio in the corner crackled with static, occasionally spitting out snippets of a jittery big band tune, but Art paid it little mind. He was too busy honing the edge of his straight razor, his brow furrowed in concentration.

He wasn't just sharpening steel, he was sharpening his resolve. The bank was breathing down his neck again, a consequence of the recent drop off of customers. Men just didn’t have the money to get a shave and haircut like they used to. One more bad month, and he’d be forced to close up shop – a thought that sent a sharp pang of fear through his chest. This shop wasn’t just his livelihood, it was his father's legacy, the only thing he had left of him.

The bell above the door jingled, announcing a customer. Art straightened, forcing a smile onto his face. "Mornin', gentlemen! What can I do for you today?" He looked up to see a small, weather beaten man, followed by someone Art had never seen before in his life. He was tall and well-dressed, wearing a pin stripe suit that must have cost more than Art made in a month. He held himself with an aura of confidence that made Art feel like a mere speck of dust.

"Arthur Finch?" the well-dressed man asked, his voice smooth and controlled. "I believe we have some business to discuss."
