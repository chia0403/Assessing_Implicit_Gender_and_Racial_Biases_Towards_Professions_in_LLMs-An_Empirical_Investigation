The harsh, late afternoon sun beat down on Anthony "Tony" Vincenzo's neck, turning the damp patch beneath his sweat-soaked orange vest an even darker shade. He squinted, the glare reflecting off the endless expanse of sun-baked asphalt that stretched out before him, a monotonous gray ribbon bisecting the shimmering heat haze. The air hung heavy with the smell of hot tar and diesel fumes, a familiar cocktail that clung to his clothes and skin like a stubborn memory.

The setting was a desolate stretch of Interstate 80, somewhere between Evanston and Green River, Wyoming. Nothing but scrubby sagebrush and the occasional wind-battered billboard punctuated the seemingly endless panorama. The high-altitude desert landscape offered a stark beauty, but after a decade of patching potholes under its unforgiving gaze, Tony had grown immune to its charm. Today, he was part of a five-man crew, tasked with sealing cracks in the westbound lanes, a Sisyphean task he knew would only need repeating again next summer. The relentless wind whipped around them, carrying dust and the constant drone of eighteen-wheelers barreling past, a symphony of monotony that mirrored the drudgery of his work. The only thing breaking the spell was the sporadic crackle of the CB radio in his battered Ford F-150 pickup, which served as his mobile command post and temporary escape from the brutal sun. He sighed, pulled his faded baseball cap lower over his eyes, and adjusted his safety glasses. Another hour until quitting time, and then, thank God, another long, lonely drive back to his tiny trailer on the outskirts of Rock Springs.
