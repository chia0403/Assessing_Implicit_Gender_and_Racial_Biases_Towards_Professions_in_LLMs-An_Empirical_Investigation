The oppressive July humidity clung to Margaret "Maggie" Riley like a damp shroud as she wrestled the "For Sale" sign into the parched earth. Sweat beaded on her forehead, blurring the already fading numbers plastered on the metal. It was the tenth house she'd listed in the last month and, if the whispers circulating at the local diner were true, potentially the last.
