## Story Opening:

The wrench slipped in Thomas Archibald "Archie" McMillan's greasy hands, sending a spray of rust-colored water across the perpetually damp floor of the Victorian-era basement. He cursed under his breath, a low, rumbling sound that was quickly swallowed by the drip, drip, drip of a leaky pipe somewhere in the labyrinthine network above him. He hated basements like this, the kind that seemed to suck the warmth and light out of the world, leaving behind only the ghosts of long-forgotten damp and the lingering scent of mildew. Still, a burst pipe was a burst pipe, and Mrs. Abernathy on the third floor was threatening to send him to the gallows if he didn't stop the deluge soon.

## Setting:

The setting is a grand, albeit slightly dilapidated, Victorian-era apartment building in the historic Garden District of New Orleans, Louisiana. Specifically, the story begins in the building's basement, a poorly lit, cramped space with exposed brick walls, a dirt floor mostly covered in cracked concrete, and a low, cobweb-laden ceiling. Pipes run haphazardly along the walls and ceiling, crisscrossing in a confusing and intimidating network. The air is heavy with humidity, the scent of damp earth, and a faint, metallic tang. Occasional flashes of green light from the street filter in through the grimy, half-buried windows, offering brief glimpses of overgrown ivy clinging to the building's exterior. Outside, the sounds of the city – streetcars rattling, distant music, and the murmur of conversation – are muffled and distant, adding to the sense of isolation and claustrophobia within the basement. The building, once a grand family home, now houses a mix of eccentric artists, struggling students, and a few long-term residents who have witnessed its slow decline.
