## Story Opening:

The acrid smell of dragonfire clung to the air, a phantom limb of the battle that had ravaged the city just days ago. Sergeant Aella Thorne, her face grimy with soot and exhaustion etched into the lines around her eyes, leaned heavily against the charred remains of what had once been a grand merchant's stall. Dust motes danced in the weak dawn light filtering through the broken archway above her, illuminating the devastation that stretched as far as she could see. The rhythmic clang of hammers echoed in the distance - the city's heart, though wounded, still beat. She took a long, slow drag from her flask, the cheap, watered-down ale doing little to soothe the rawness in her throat or the ache in her bones. But it was something. Anything was something these days.

## Setting:

The story is set in the city of **Silverhaven**, a once-thriving port city nestled between the jagged peaks of the Serpent's Tooth mountains and the shimmering expanse of the Azure Sea. Silverhaven was known for its bustling trade routes, its intricate network of canals, and its renowned Academy of Scribes. However, recent events have left their mark. Dragonfire scorches the buildings along the harbor, and rubble chokes the once-busy thoroughfares. The city guard, already stretched thin before the dragon attack, are now struggling to maintain order amidst the fear and uncertainty. The docks are damaged and choked with debris, slowing the flow of vital supplies. Despite the destruction, signs of resilience are emerging â€“ colorful banners of defiance hang from surviving buildings, and the sound of construction resonates throughout the ruined streets. The heart of Silverhaven has been wounded, but it refuses to be broken.
