## The Setting:

The salty air tasted of brine and decaying wood, a familiar flavor to most residents of Port Blossom. Nestled into a crook of the rugged coastline, Port Blossom clung to the edge of the world, a place where time seemed to slow down and the sea dictated the rhythms of life. Gnarled, weather-beaten houses, painted in faded shades of blue and green, stood sentinel against the persistent wind. Fishing boats, patched and repainted more times than anyone could remember, bobbed restlessly in the harbor, their masts clanging a mournful song in the breeze. The scent of fish, both fresh and less so, permeated everything, mingling with the earthy smell of the surrounding pine forest. The heart of the town was a sprawling, ramshackle marketplace, where fishermen hawked their daily catches, farmers offered meager crops gleaned from the rocky soil, and the occasional traveler haggled for supplies. This was a place where secrets whispered on the wind, and the sea held mysteries that even the oldest sailors couldn't fathom.

## The Story Opening:

Eliza Maeve Tanner hated the smell of fish guts. Even after thirty years of living in Port Blossom, the stench still turned her stomach. She hammered another nail into the warped frame of the shop sign, the rhythmic clang echoing through the mostly deserted marketplace. "Tanner & Sons, Fine Carpentry," it would proclaim, once she finished patching it up. Though, she amended silently, it should probably read "Tanner & Daughter," seeing as her brother, Finn, had traded his chisel for a rum bottle five years back, leaving her to single-handedly run the business her father had started. She spat a stray strand of dark hair from her mouth and squinted at the fading paint. The relentless sun and salt spray were slowly devouring everything in Port Blossom, including, she suspected, her patience.

A low groan drew her attention. It came from the direction of the old, abandoned lighthouse, its skeletal frame a constant, haunting presence on the horizon. A shiver ran down Eliza's spine. The lighthouse had been dark for as long as she could remember, shrouded in whispers and rumors. Locals claimed it was cursed, haunted by the ghost of a drowned sailor. Eliza, a woman of practicality and sawdust, scoffed at such nonsense. But still, the sound...it sounded like wood screaming under immense pressure. She gripped her hammer tighter, a knot forming in her stomach. Something wasn't right in Port Blossom, and Eliza Maeve Tanner had a feeling it was about to get a whole lot worse.
