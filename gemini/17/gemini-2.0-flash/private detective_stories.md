## Story Opening:

The rain was a vindictive lover, clinging to the slate rooftops of Chicago and whispering promises of pneumonia. Inside, the cheap whiskey did its best to ward off the damp chill, but it was a losing battle. Smoke, thick and acrid from a dozen cheap cigarettes extinguished in a chipped ashtray, clung to the air like a ghost. I took another pull, the fiery liquid burning a welcome path down my throat. Just when I thought I might actually start feeling warm, the buzzer screeched like a rusty gate swinging open to hell.

I sighed, the sound a weary expulsion of all the disappointment life had thrown my way lately. "Just a damn minute," I growled, pushing myself up from the threadbare armchair that was practically glued to my backside. Through the grimy glass of the office door, I could make out a figure, hunched against the downpour, like a drowned rat desperate for shelter. Business, I suspected, was about to walk in. And business, in my line of work, rarely brought good news.

## Setting:

The year is 1948. My office, a depressing sliver of space above a failing tailor shop in Lincoln Park, is a testament to the dwindling success of my profession. The walls are a sickly shade of beige, peeling in places and stained with the memories of countless forgotten cases. A single bare bulb hangs precariously from the ceiling, casting long, unforgiving shadows. The only furniture is the aforementioned armchair, a battered wooden desk piled high with files (mostly cold ones), and a couple of rickety chairs for clients â€“ though, lately, they'd seen more dust than backsides. The neighborhood itself is a blend of struggling immigrant families, ambitious newcomers, and those down on their luck, all vying for a piece of the American dream, or simply trying to survive.
