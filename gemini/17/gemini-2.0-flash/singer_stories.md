Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a singer:

**Setting:**

The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of frying onions, cheap perfume, and stale beer. The "Starlight Lounge," a dive bar clinging to the fringes of Las Vegas's glittering reputation, pulsed with a tired, weary energy. Neon signs flickered intermittently outside, casting a sickly green and pink glow across the chipped Formica tables and the worn red vinyl booths. Inside, the din of conversation, clinking glasses, and the ever-present hum of the overworked air conditioning unit created a low, persistent thrum. It was a Tuesday night, and the Starlight was as busy as it ever got – a collection of tourists down on their luck, locals looking for an escape, and the perpetually hopeful, all clinging to the illusion of Vegas magic.

**Opening:**

The spotlight, a temperamental beast prone to fits of buzzing and dimming, stubbornly refused to focus on the center of the tiny, raised stage.  A cough rippled through the crowd as **Isabella "Izzy" Moreau** adjusted the microphone stand, her fingers tracing the cool metal. She could feel the familiar tremor starting in her hands, a nervous prelude to the night ahead. She smoothed down the shimmering, slightly-too-tight silver dress she'd bought secondhand, a desperate attempt to look "Vegas ready." Tonight wasn't just another Tuesday night at the Starlight Lounge; tonight, Mr. Carmine DeLuca, a producer rumored to have an ear for talent and deep pockets, was in the audience. Isabella closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and remembered her grandmother's words: *“Sing from the heart, Izzy. That’s the only way to reach them.”* Then, opening them again, she gave the band a small nod and launched into the opening chords of “At Last.”
