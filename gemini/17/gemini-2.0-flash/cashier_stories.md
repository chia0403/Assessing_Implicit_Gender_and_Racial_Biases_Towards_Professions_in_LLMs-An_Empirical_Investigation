The fluorescent lights of "Marty's Market" hummed a monotonous song, a soundtrack to Beatrice Eleanor Rose's life. Her fingers, nimble from years of practice, danced across the scanner, the *beep* of each item a percussive counterpoint to the hum. Outside, a slate grey sky threatened rain, mirroring the grey ennui settling in Beatrice's bones. She smoothed down the lapel of her faded blue Marty's Market uniform, the embroidered name tag – "Beatrice" – a stark reminder of the person she was, versus the person she dreamed of being.

Beatrice wasn't supposed to be a cashier at Marty's. She was supposed to be painting murals in Florence, sketching portraits in Paris, *living*. But life, as it often did, had other plans. Plans involving student loans, a sick mother, and a small, suffocating town in Ohio called Harmony Creek. Marty's Market, with its aisles of dusty cereal boxes and wilted lettuce, was a temporary stop, a stepping stone, a place to simply *exist* while she figured things out.

Today, however, felt different. There was a tension in the air, a static electricity that made the hairs on the back of her neck prickle. A sense that something, something significant, was about to disrupt the monotonous rhythm of her day, and perhaps, her life. It wasn't just the impending storm; it was something deeper, a tremor in the very fabric of Harmony Creek, a tremor that Beatrice felt all the way down to the soles of her sensible shoes. The next customer shuffling towards her register, an elderly woman with a basket full of cat food and prune juice, seemed completely oblivious. But Beatrice, Beatrice knew. Something was coming.
