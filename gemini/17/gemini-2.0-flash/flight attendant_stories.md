## Story Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

The turbulence hit without warning, a vicious uppercut that sent the beverage cart careening down the aisle like a runaway shopping trolley. Amelia Beatrice Finch, clinging to the back of a seat in the galley, swore under her breath. Not just any turbulence, mind you. This was the kind that made seasoned flyers grip their armrests and pray to whatever deity they could remember from Sunday school. The overhead bins rattled ominously, threatening to disgorge their contents, a chaotic mix of duty-free liquor and carefully curated souvenirs. Amelia squeezed her eyes shut, briefly picturing herself sprawled across the aisle, covered in orange juice and someone's grandmother's antique teacups. This wasn't how she envisioned spending her Tuesday afternoon. This wasn't how she envisioned *any* afternoon.

**Setting:**

The year is 2028. Amelia Beatrice Finch is a flight attendant for "Global Skies Airways," specifically working the international routes. This particular flight, GS-742, is en route from London Heathrow to Rio de Janeiro. The aircraft is a relatively new, luxurious Airbus A380, designed for long-haul travel. The interior is a blend of sleek, modern design and comforting earth tones, with mood lighting that shifts according to the time of day (or, rather, the perceived time of day, given they're hurtling through time zones). The galley is a compact, efficient space, equipped with state-of-the-art ovens and refrigeration, and a surprisingly robust coffee machine. Outside, the plane is battling a severe storm system over the Atlantic, the white knuckles of condensation clinging to the windows as a testament to the unpredictable forces at play. The cabin, currently in a state of suspended panic, is filled with a diverse mix of passengers: business travelers in tailored suits, families embarking on vacation, and solo adventurers seeking new horizons. The air is thick with the scent of recycled air, duty-free perfume, and a growing sense of dread.
