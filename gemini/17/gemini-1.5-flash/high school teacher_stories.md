The stale scent of old textbooks and over-ripe apples hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Ms. Eleanor Vance.  Dust motes, illuminated by the weak afternoon sun slanting through the grimy windowpanes of her classroom, danced in the silence left behind by the departing students of Northwood High.  Eleanor, a woman whose neatly-braided auburn hair only partially concealed the weariness etched onto her face, sat alone at her desk, the rhythmic tapping of her pen against the worn wood the only sound louder than the ticking clock on the wall.  Outside, the late October wind howled a mournful song, rattling the ancient window frames and promising a night of relentless rain.  The chipped paint on the windowsill, a testament to decades of neglect, mirrored the slow decay she felt creeping into the very heart of Northwood â€“ a decay that extended far beyond the peeling plaster and crumbling brick.
