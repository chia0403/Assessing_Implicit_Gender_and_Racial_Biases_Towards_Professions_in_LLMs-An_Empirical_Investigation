The salt spray stung Dr. Eleanor Vance's face as she wrestled the recalcitrant fishing net, its knotted mesh a stubborn adversary against the fading light.  The air, thick with the briny tang of the North Sea and the sharp scent of seaweed, whipped her auburn braid across her cheek.  Below her, the rocky outcrop of Grimstone Island, barely more than a jagged tooth in the churning grey water, was home to a population more diverse than any mainland town â€“ a colony of puffins, a grumpy seal named Bartholomew who considered the island his personal kingdom, and a scattering of hardy humans, mostly fishermen whose lives were as weathered as the granite cliffs themselves.  This was Eleanor's domain, a place where the calls of gulls often drowned out the ringing of the phone, and where the most urgent cases involved tangled fishing lines, not feline allergies. Tonight, however, felt different. A hushed urgency in the call from old Mr. Silas had hinted at something far more unusual than a limping sheep.
