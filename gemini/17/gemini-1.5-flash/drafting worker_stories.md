The fluorescent lights of the drafting room hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic scratch of Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s pencil on Mylar.  Dust motes, illuminated by the harsh glare, danced in the stagnant air above her drafting table, a miniature galaxy swirling in the confines of the cramped, windowless room.  Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the sprawling industrial complex of Peterson & Sons, a stark contrast to the perpetual twilight within. Amelia, her brow furrowed in concentration, meticulously adjusted a line on her architectural blueprint, the faint scent of stale coffee and developing chemicals clinging to the air like a second skin.  She worked surrounded by the ghosts of past projects – rolled blueprints stacked high to the ceiling, their faded ink hinting at forgotten buildings and ambitious dreams.  Tonight, though, the dream was hers, or rather, Mr. Peterson's, and it involved a rather ambitious new skyscraper slated for the city's burgeoning financial district.
