The chipped paint of Mrs. Eleanor Vance’s classroom desk, a faded floral pattern barely visible beneath layers of crayon and spilled glue, mirrored the state of her own frayed nerves.  It was the last week of school, a week traditionally reserved for chaotic crafts, sugar-fueled meltdowns, and the bittersweet symphony of goodbyes.  But this year, the usual end-of-year pandemonium felt amplified, charged with an almost palpable sense of…unease.  The air in Room 2B of Hawthorne Elementary hung thick and heavy, not just with the scent of tempera paint and impending summer vacation, but with a strange, unsettling quiet that prickled at Eleanor’s skin.  Outside, the usually vibrant playground buzzed with a subdued energy, the laughter muted, replaced by a hushed, conspiratorial whispering that drifted through the open windows like a restless wind.  Even the usually boisterous chatter of her third graders was replaced by a nervous fidgeting and furtive glances. Something was wrong, terribly wrong, and Eleanor Vance, seasoned teacher of ten years, knew it in the pit of her stomach.
