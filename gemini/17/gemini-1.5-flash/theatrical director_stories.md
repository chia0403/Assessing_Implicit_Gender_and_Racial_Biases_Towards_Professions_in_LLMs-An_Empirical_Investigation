The biting November wind whipped Amelia Beatrice Worthington’s auburn hair across her face as she wrestled the recalcitrant stage door open.  The wrought iron groaned a mournful protest, its intricate curlicues silhouetted against the bruised purple of the twilight sky.  Rain, a fine, insistent drizzle, plastered her coat to her back, clinging like a second skin.  Before her lay the crumbling grandeur of the Blackwood Theatre, a majestic Victorian behemoth that had seen better days – and far more glittering premières.  Its once-proud façade, now scarred with the ravages of time and neglect, hinted at the faded glory within, a glory Amelia, with a burning ambition that outweighed the theatre's dilapidated state, was determined to resurrect.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp plaster and decaying velvet, a perfume both melancholic and strangely intoxicating to her.  Tonight, the Blackwood was hers – or at least, it would be, if she could just manage to get the blasted door to cooperate long enough to get inside and start rehearsing.
