The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood’s hair across her face, stinging her cheeks a fiery red.  She pulled her worn, fleece-lined jacket tighter, the collar scratching against her already chapped skin.  The air hung thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, a familiar fragrance that usually calmed her, but tonight, it only served to amplify the gnawing anxiety in her stomach.  The moon, a sliver of bone in the inky sky, cast long, skeletal shadows across the sprawling grounds of Blackwood Manor, its gothic silhouette looming against the starless night like a silent, judging sentinel.  Amelia, head caretaker of Blackwood Manor's menagerie – a collection of rescued and rehabilitated animals as eclectic as the manor itself –  wasn’t worried about the animals; they were tucked safely away in their heated shelters.  No, her unease stemmed from something far more unsettling, a premonition that hung heavier than the winter air.
