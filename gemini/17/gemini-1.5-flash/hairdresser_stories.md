The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume only Amelia "Mia" Carmichael's salon, "Shear Genius," could produce.  It was a humid Tuesday afternoon in Charleston, South Carolina, the kind where the Spanish moss draped languidly from the ancient oaks lining King Street seemed to sigh in the oppressive heat.  Mia, perched on a worn, leather-topped stool behind her styling station, expertly wielded a pair of shears, snipping away at a client’s unruly blonde mane with the practiced ease of a seasoned surgeon.  The rhythmic snip-snip-snip punctuated the low hum of conversation drifting from the other three stations, a symphony of gossip, hairspray, and the gentle whir of blow dryers. Outside, the clip-clop of horse-drawn carriages echoed the steady rhythm of Mia’s work, a comforting counterpoint to the frantic energy simmering beneath the surface of her otherwise picture-perfect salon.
