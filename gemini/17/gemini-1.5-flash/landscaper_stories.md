The dawn mist clung to the manicured lawns of the exclusive Seabrook Estates like a damp shroud, clinging to the dew-kissed blades of St. Augustine grass and the glossy leaves of the camellia bushes.  A faint salt tang hung in the air, a constant reminder of the ocean’s proximity, barely a stone’s throw from the meticulously landscaped properties.  Elias Thorne, his breath puffing white clouds in the pre-sunrise chill, adjusted the worn leather strap of his tool bag.  The weight of it was familiar, comforting even, a counterpoint to the quiet anticipation that always preceded a new day on the job.  His weathered hands, calloused and strong from years spent coaxing life from the earth, moved with practiced ease as he unlatched the bag, revealing the gleam of polished shears, the sturdy grip of his favourite spade, and the comforting scent of fresh potting soil.  Today’s challenge: the notoriously difficult Mrs. Vandergelt’s azaleas.  Elias knew it wouldn't be easy.  Mrs. Vandergelt, with her discerning eye and even more discerning tongue, was a legend among the Seabrook landscapers.
