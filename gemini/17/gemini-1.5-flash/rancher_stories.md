The wind, a rasping baritone, howled across the plains, whipping dust devils into frenzied dances across the parched earth.  Sun-bleached bones of long-dead cattle littered the landscape, grim markers of the relentless drought that had choked the life from the Texas panhandle for the past three years.  Dust clung to everything, a gritty film coating the weathered wood of the ranch house and the calloused hands of Elias Thorne, a man whose face was as deeply lined and sun-baked as the cracked soil beneath his boots.  Elias, with his salt-and-pepper beard and eyes the color of a stormy sky, squinted at the horizon, a familiar tension tightening in his jaw.  The Thorne Ranch, once a jewel of the region, now looked more like a forgotten graveyard.  The only sound louder than the wind was the relentless ticking of the grandfather clock in the silent, dust-laden hall of the main house, each tick a grim reminder of time relentlessly marching on, time that was running out.
