The chipped paint of the fire escape flaked onto Amelia Hernandez's crisp white blouse, a tiny, ironic snowfall on a July afternoon.  Sweat beaded on her forehead, mirroring the condensation clinging to the lukewarm coffee in her hand.  Below, the cacophony of New York City – a symphony of car horns, shouting vendors, and the rhythmic thud of construction – pulsed with a relentless energy that Amelia both thrived on and desperately needed to escape.  From her perch on the third-floor fire escape of the crumbling brownstone that housed "Justice First Legal Services," a distinctly un-glamorous law firm nestled in the gritty heart of the Lower East Side, she surveyed her domain: a chaotic landscape of overflowing dumpsters, graffiti-covered brick walls, and the ever-present aroma of frying onions and exhaust fumes.  It wasn't exactly the picture-perfect view she’d imagined when she’d traded her small-town life for the promise of big-city excitement, but Amelia, a paralegal with a caffeine addiction and a penchant for uncovering hidden truths, wouldn't have it any other way.  This was her battlefield, and today, she had a war to fight.
