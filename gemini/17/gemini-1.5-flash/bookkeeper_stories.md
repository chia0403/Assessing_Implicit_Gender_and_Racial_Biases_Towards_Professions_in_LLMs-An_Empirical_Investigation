The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s fingers, the lukewarm tea doing little to chase away the November chill that seeped through the drafty window of her office.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single, bare bulb hanging precariously above her desk, danced in the weak light.  Amelia, a woman whose life was as meticulously ordered as the ledgers she balanced, stared out at the cobbled street below, the grey sky mirroring the weariness settling in her bones.  Her office, perched on the third floor of a crumbling Victorian building in the once-grand, now decidedly dilapidated, district of Ashwood, offered a panoramic view of neglect.  Broken windowpanes stared back like empty eyes, and the rhythmic clang of a distant blacksmith’s hammer punctuated the otherwise mournful silence of the afternoon.  The air smelled faintly of coal smoke and damp earth, a scent that, despite its unpleasantness, had become as familiar to Amelia as the comforting weight of her well-worn fountain pen.
