The fluorescent lights of the Mercy General Hospital phlebotomy lab hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* of Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s own heartbeat.  It was a sound she’d learned to tune out, a necessary skill for a phlebotomist navigating the chaotic symphony of a busy city hospital.  Amelia, however, found it impossible to ignore the erratic flutter in her chest this morning.  It wasn’t the caffeine – she'd sworn off coffee weeks ago – nor the usual pre-shift jitters.  This was different, a deep-seated unease that clung to her like the faint scent of antiseptic lingering in the air.  Outside, the pre-dawn gloom of a San Francisco November pressed against the panoramic windows, the city lights blurring into a hazy watercolor of grey and gold.  Inside, the sterile, stainless steel counters gleamed under the harsh lights, reflecting the nervous energy that thrummed through Amelia's veins, a stark contrast to the calm efficiency she needed to maintain.
