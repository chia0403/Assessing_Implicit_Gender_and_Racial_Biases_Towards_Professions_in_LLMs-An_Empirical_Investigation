The brass spittoon gleamed under the sickly yellow light of the Palm Royale Hotel lobby, a glint mirroring the nervous sheen on nineteen-year-old Archibald "Archie" Finch's forehead.  Archie, a bellhop whose uniform felt more like a straitjacket than a symbol of service, adjusted the already perfectly positioned cap perched atop his unruly auburn curls. The air hung thick and heavy with the cloying scent of lilies and stale cigarettes, a perfume only slightly less suffocating than the oppressive humidity of the Miami summer night.  Outside, the rhythmic crash of waves against the shore was a distant, almost mocking, counterpoint to the staccato tap-tap-tap of the hotel's aged grandfather clock. The Palm Royale, once a jewel of Art Deco glamour, now possessed a faded, slightly melancholic beauty, its grandeur masked by a layer of neglect and the lingering ghost of its former glory.  Tonight, however, felt different; the usual languid atmosphere thrummed with an almost palpable tension, a sense of anticipation that prickled Archie's skin like the first bite of a Key lime pie.
