Rain lashed against the arched windows, a relentless drumming that mirrored the persistent ache in his left shoulder – a souvenir from a particularly unruly guest, a Mr. Silas Blackwood III, whose lineage was as dubious as his temper.  The Blackwood, a gothic behemoth perched precariously on the cliff overlooking the churning grey sea, was more than a hotel; it was a mausoleum of faded grandeur, a repository of secrets whispered on the wind and etched into the very fabric of its decaying elegance.  Tonight, however, the secrets felt particularly heavy, pressing down on Gus like the damp, sea-laden air.  He sighed, the sound swallowed by the storm’s fury.  Another night, another potential catastrophe brewing behind the hotel's velvet-roped doors.
