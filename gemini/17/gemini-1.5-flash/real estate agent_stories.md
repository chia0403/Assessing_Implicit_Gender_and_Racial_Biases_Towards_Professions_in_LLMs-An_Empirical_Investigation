The salt spray stung Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s face as she wrestled the stubborn “For Sale” sign into the windswept sand.  The wind, a relentless, icy beast from the north, howled a mournful tune across the desolate expanse of Cape Cod’s Outer Beach.

This wasn’t exactly the quaint seaside cottage she usually dealt with; this was a challenge, a tempest in a teacup – or rather, a tempest threatening to swallow the entire teacup whole.  The listing, whispered to her by a tight-lipped, grief-stricken widow, was shrouded in more mystery than even the thick fog that often blanketed the coast.  Amelia braced herself.  This sale wouldn't be easy.
