The fluorescent lights of the Blackwood Memorial Library hummed a discordant symphony, a counterpoint to the rhythmic swish of Elias Thorne's mop.  Elias, a man whose life was measured in the quiet cadence of sweeping and scrubbing, ran the mop across the polished marble floor, leaving behind a gleaming streak that vanished almost immediately under the relentless march of unseen dust motes dancing in the single shaft of moonlight piercing the tall gothic windows.  The air hung thick with the scent of old paper and leather, a fragrance Elias had come to know as intimately as the creases etched into his own work-worn hands.  Tonight, however, a different scent mingled with the familiar – a sharp, metallic tang that pricked at his nostrils and sent a shiver down his spine, a scent that spoke not of aging books, but of something… else.  The library, usually a sanctuary of hushed whispers and turning pages, felt different tonight; heavy, expectant.  The silence itself felt charged.
