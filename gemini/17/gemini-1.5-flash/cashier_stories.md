The fluorescent lights of "Quick Stop & Shop" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Elara Jean Blackwood's Tuesday afternoon.  The air hung thick with the cloying sweetness of cheap air freshener – something vaguely floral trying desperately to mask the underlying aroma of stale coffee and desperation.  Elara, perched on her stool behind the chipped Formica counter, meticulously arranged a display of suspiciously shiny apples.  Each one felt oddly heavy in her hand, mirroring the weight of her own weariness.  Outside, the late summer sun beat down on the cracked asphalt of the parking lot, baking the already sweltering air inside the convenience store into a near-unbearable humidity.  The only other customer was a man hunched over a lottery ticket, his face obscured by shadow, muttering to himself about the elusive numbers that would change his life.  Elara sighed, the sound swallowed by the relentless hum of the refrigerator in the back.  Another Tuesday, another slow day at Quick Stop & Shop.  Another day closer to…well, she wasn’t quite sure what.
