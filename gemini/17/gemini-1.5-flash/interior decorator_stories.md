The chipped paint on the windowsill, a faded robin's egg blue clinging desperately to the crumbling plaster, was the first thing Aurelia “Ria” Blackwood noticed.  It was a detail most people would miss, swallowed whole by the overwhelming chaos of the room: overflowing bookshelves threatening to topple, a tapestry depicting a rather alarmingly realistic unicorn hanging askew, and enough dust to suggest a family of dust bunnies had established a thriving civilization.  Ria, however, lived for these details.  This wasn’t just a room; it was a canvas screaming for a transformative touch, a challenge waiting to be met. The air hung heavy with the scent of old paper, damp earth, and something vaguely resembling forgotten spices, all contained within the rambling, centuries-old stone walls of Blackwood Manor – the ancestral home of her recently deceased, eccentric, and profoundly messy Aunt Mildred.  The inheritance was less a fortune and more a monument to accumulated clutter, but to Ria, a professional interior decorator with a penchant for the dramatic, it was a dream come true.
