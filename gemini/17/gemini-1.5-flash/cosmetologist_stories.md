The low hum of the hairdryer blended with the gentle chatter of women swapping stories over steaming mugs of chamomile tea, creating a soothing symphony that was as much a part of Izzy's life as the sharp snip of her shears. Tonight, however, the usual calming rhythm was punctuated by an unsettling tension, a prickle at the back of Izzy's neck that hinted at something far from the usual salon drama.
