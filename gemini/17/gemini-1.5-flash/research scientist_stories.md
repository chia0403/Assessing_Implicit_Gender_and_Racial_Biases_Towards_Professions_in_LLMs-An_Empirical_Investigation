The biting Antarctic wind howled a mournful symphony around Dr. Aris Thorne’s research station, a relentless counterpoint to the rhythmic whirring of the internal generators.  Ice, sculpted by millennia of glacial movement into fantastical shapes, clawed at the prefabricated buildings, their metal skins groaning under the pressure.  Aris, bundled in layers of thermal gear that felt more like a spacesuit than clothing, peered through the frosted window of his lab.  The blizzard, a swirling maelstrom of white fury, obscured even the usually stark, unforgiving landscape.  He hadn't seen the sun in three days, a fact that weighed heavier on his spirits than the relentless cold.  The isolation, however, was nothing compared to the pressure mounting from the anomalous readings emanating from the ice core sample – readings that defied everything he thought he knew about the planet's geological history.
