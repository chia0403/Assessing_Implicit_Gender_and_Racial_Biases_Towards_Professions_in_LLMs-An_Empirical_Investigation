The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of blood, sawdust, and something vaguely floral – Mrs. Gable’s attempt at masking the inevitable aroma of a butcher shop.  Bartholomew “Barty” Finch, proprietor of Finch’s Finest Cuts, wiped his hands on his stained apron, the crimson smear a stark contrast against the crisp white fabric.  It was a Tuesday, which meant the market rush was over, leaving behind a scattering of stray bones and the lingering chill of early autumn in the air.  Barty’s shop, nestled on the cobbled edge of Oakhaven’s market square, was a time capsule – wood-beamed, low-ceilinged, and overflowing with the comforting chaos of hanging sausages, glistening hams, and the rhythmic thump of his cleaver echoing softly against the aged oak counter. Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the uneven paving stones, painting the scene in hues of burnt orange and fading gold.  The church bell tolled four, a sound that always seemed to signal the start of Barty’s evening, a quiet time for reflection – and perhaps, a well-deserved pint at the Crooked Tankard.
