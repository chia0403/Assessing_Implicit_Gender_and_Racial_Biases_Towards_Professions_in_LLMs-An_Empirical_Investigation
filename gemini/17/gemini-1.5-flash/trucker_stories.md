The battered chrome of Big Rig Bertha’s grill reflected the bruised purple of the Wyoming sunset, a fiery smear across the vast, indifferent sky.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of grit and sorrow, danced across the cracked asphalt of Highway 20, swirling around the eighteen-wheeler like vengeful spirits.  Inside the cab, the air hung thick with the smell of stale coffee, diesel fumes, and the faint, metallic tang of blood – not his, thankfully, but a lingering reminder of the busted deer that had graced his bumper last week.  Forty-seven-year-old  Clarence “Clay”  Montgomery shifted in his seat, the worn leather groaning a sympathetic sigh. His knuckles, thick and scarred like ancient river stones, tightened around the steering wheel.  The radio crackled with static, a fitting soundtrack to the desolate beauty of the landscape, a landscape that had swallowed whole more men than Clay cared to remember.  Tonight, however, the emptiness felt heavier, more personal.  He wasn't just hauling freight across the plains; he was hauling a burden of his own, a secret that gnawed at him with the persistence of a prairie dog digging its burrow.
