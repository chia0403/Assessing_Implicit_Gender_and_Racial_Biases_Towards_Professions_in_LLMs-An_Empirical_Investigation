The chipped paint of the writing desk flaked onto Amelia Grace Hawthorne's manuscript, a tiny, ochre speck mirroring the dust motes dancing in the afternoon sunbeams slanting through the attic window.  Amelia, or Amy as she preferred, sighed, the sound swallowed by the cavernous space.  The attic of her grandmother's rambling Victorian house, Willow Creek, was less a haven for inspiration and more a suffocating mausoleum of forgotten memories and moth-eaten heirlooms.  The air hung thick with the scent of dried lavender and something else, something subtly acrid, like the ghost of a long-extinguished fire.  Outside, a summer storm brewed, the wind rattling the loose shingles like skeletal fingers against glass.  Amy, however, was far more concerned with the blank page staring back at her, a stark, white challenge in the gloom.  Her deadline loomed, a monstrous, shadowy figure pressing down on her like the weight of the attic's decaying timbers.
