Amy shivered, not entirely from the cold. The radio remained stubbornly silent, a chilling void mirroring the emptiness gnawing at her stomach.  Her last transmission, a simple "Approaching Turnagain Arm," had been swallowed by the unforgiving wilderness hours ago. Now, only the rhythmic thrum of the engine and the relentless wind served as companions on this perilous, solitary flight.
