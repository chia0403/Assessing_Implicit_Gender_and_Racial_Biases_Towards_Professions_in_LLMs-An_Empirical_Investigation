The biting Montana wind whipped at Amelia “Amy” Blackwood’s cheeks, stinging like a thousand tiny needles.  It clawed at the exposed skin of her hands, already raw from wrestling with the controls of the D9 bulldozer all morning.  The sun, a weak, watery disc behind a bruised purple sky, offered little warmth.  Amy shivered, pulling her worn, orange-and-black hard hat further down over her ears.  Around her, the vast expanse of the Bitterroot Valley sprawled beneath a blanket of freshly fallen snow, the skeletal branches of pines scratching at the pale canvas like arthritic fingers.  The only other sounds were the rhythmic growl of her behemoth machine, the crunch of its treads on the frozen earth, and the distant, mournful howl of a coyote.  This was her kingdom, a kingdom of mud, rock, and biting wind, and Amy Blackwood, queen of her Caterpillar, was ready to conquer it, one frozen cubic yard at a time.
