The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face, a familiar kiss from the unforgiving Atlantic.  He braced himself against the relentless wind, the biting chill seeping through the layers of his oilskins despite the thick wool lining.  Around him, the craggy cliffs of Cornwall plunged dramatically into the churning grey sea, a symphony of white-capped waves crashing against the jagged rocks below.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and seaweed, carried the mournful cry of gulls, a stark counterpoint to the rhythmic thunder of the ocean. Elias adjusted the strap of his vintage Hasselblad, its cold metal a reassuring weight against his shoulder.  He was perched precariously on a narrow ledge, a precarious perch offering a breathtaking, if slightly terrifying, view of the tempestuous beauty before him. This storm, a brooding leviathan of wind and water, was the subject of his latest obsession, a photographic masterpiece waiting to be captured.  He just needed to find the right angle, the perfect moment, to translate its untamed power onto film.
