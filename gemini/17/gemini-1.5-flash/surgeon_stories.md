The biting November wind whipped Dr. Evelyn Reed's charcoal grey coat around her legs as she hurried across the deserted quadrangle of St. Jude's Hospital.  Rain, the kind that seeped into your bones and chilled you to the marrow, lashed down, blurring the already indistinct gaslights into hazy halos.  The imposing gothic architecture of the hospital, usually a source of grim but comforting familiarity, loomed tonight like a skeletal finger pointing accusingly at the turbulent sky.  Inside, the sterile scent of antiseptic usually fought off the lingering aroma of decay inherent in any place that dealt with life's fragility.  Tonight, however, a strange, metallic tang hung in the air, a coppery whisper that clung to Evelyn's throat and tightened her already knot of anxiety in her chest.  The emergency lights flickered erratically, casting long, distorted shadows that danced like phantoms in her peripheral vision.  This was not a typical Tuesday night at St. Jude's.
