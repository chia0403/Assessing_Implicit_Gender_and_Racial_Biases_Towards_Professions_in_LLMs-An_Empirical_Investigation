The chipped porcelain sink groaned under the weight of Isabella “Izzy” Diaz’s elbows as she stared at her reflection.  The harsh fluorescent light of the cramped bathroom in her Chinatown office mercilessly illuminated the shadows under her eyes – a permanent fixture these days, earned through a steady diet of cheap instant ramen and even cheaper cases.  Rain hammered against the grimy windowpanes, a relentless percussion accompanying the city’s low thrum.  The scent of jasmine tea from Mrs. Chan’s bakery downstairs mingled with the ever-present aroma of exhaust fumes and something vaguely fishy – probably the seafood market two blocks over.  Izzy ran a hand through her already messy, dark braid, the cheap plastic comb snagging on a stubborn knot.  Another night, another case that smelled more like desperation than dollars, clung to her like the damp chill that permeated her tiny, rent-controlled office.  Tonight, it was a missing cat. A Persian, apparently. A very expensive Persian.
