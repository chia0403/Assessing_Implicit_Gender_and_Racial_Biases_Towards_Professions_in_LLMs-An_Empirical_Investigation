The chainsaw’s whine was a counterpoint to the wind’s mournful sigh through the Douglas firs, a symphony of destruction and desolation played out against the backdrop of the Olympic National Forest.  Mist clung to the ancient trees like a shroud, blurring the already indistinct lines between towering trunks and the perpetually twilight undergrowth.  The air, thick with the smell of damp earth and decaying pine needles, carried the metallic tang of sawdust and the faint, sweet scent of resin.  This was Silas Blackwood’s world, a world of giants and shadows, where the rhythm of the axe and the roar of the engine dictated the pace of life.  Silas, his face grimy and etched with the lines of hard work and hard living, paused his work, the saw’s growl subsiding to a low hum, the silence broken only by the drip, drip, drip of condensation from the branches overhead. He wiped a hand across his brow, leaving a streak of grime against the already dirt-stained cheek, and squinted at the overcast sky.  Another storm brewing.  Another day, another mountain to conquer.
