The biting November wind howled a mournful tune around Amelia Grace Holloway as she wrestled the stretcher door closed.  The ambulance’s interior, usually a sterile, harshly lit space, was currently a chaotic symphony of red flashing lights, the rhythmic beep of monitors, and the ragged breaths of the patient slumped within. Rain lashed against the windscreen, blurring the already indistinct streetlights of the Grimsborough housing estate into hazy, watery halos.  Grimsborough, a sprawling labyrinth of concrete and despair clinging precariously to the edge of the city, was Amelia’s nightly hunting ground.  Tonight, the hunt was for a life she wasn't sure she could save. The air hung thick with the smell of damp earth and something else, something acrid and metallic, that clung to Amelia’s throat like a shroud.  This was Grimsborough at its worst, and Amelia, an Emergency Medical Technician with five years of hardened experience etched onto her weary face, was right in the heart of it.
