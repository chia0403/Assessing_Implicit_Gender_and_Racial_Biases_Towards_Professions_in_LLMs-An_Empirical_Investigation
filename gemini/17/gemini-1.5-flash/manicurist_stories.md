The scent of acetone and lavender hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Seraphina "Sera" Dubois.  Dust motes, illuminated by the harsh fluorescent lights overhead, danced in the lazy afternoon sun that streamed through the grimy window of "Nails by Sera," a tiny salon squeezed between a laundromat and a struggling bakery on the wrong side of Bleecker Street.  Cracked paint peeled from the walls, revealing layers of faded floral wallpaper underneath, a testament to the salon's age and Sera's seemingly endless struggle to keep afloat.  Outside, the cacophony of New York City – the blare of car horns, the rhythmic thud of construction, the chattering of a thousand hurried conversations – formed a low, persistent hum against the quiet click-clack of Sera's nail file.  Today, however, the usual rhythm was broken.  A silence, heavy and unnerving, settled over the salon, punctuated only by the erratic drumming of her own anxious heart.  Something was different. Something was wrong.
