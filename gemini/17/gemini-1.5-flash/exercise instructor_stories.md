The pre-dawn chill bit at Amelia Hernandezâ€™s cheeks as she unlocked the gym doors, the metal cold and slick beneath her gloved fingers.  Inside, Fitness First was a cavern of slumbering treadmills and silent weights, the only sound the hum of the ventilation system, a low, almost mournful drone.  Dust motes, illuminated by the weak glow of the emergency lights, danced in the air like tiny, exhausted ballerinas. Amelia, however, felt anything but exhausted.  The scent of sweat and linoleum, normally a pungent mix, was this early a strangely comforting aroma, a promise of the day's invigorating energy soon to fill the space.  She flipped the main power switch, the lights flickering to life and chasing away the shadows that clung to the corners of the vast room, revealing the familiar rows of equipment and the empty, expectant spin bikes. Today, Amelia would lead her 6 AM Body Blast, and she was already buzzing with the kind of frenetic, positive energy that only a true fitness fanatic could muster at 5:30 AM.
