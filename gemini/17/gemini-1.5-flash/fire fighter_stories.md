The acrid bite of woodsmoke stung Lieutenant Evelyn "Evie" Reyes's nostrils, a familiar companion on nights like these.  The air hung thick and heavy with the scent, a cloying sweetness masking the underlying stench of burning pine and terrified wildlife.  Around her, the California chaparral crackled and groaned, a symphony of destruction played out under a bruised, twilight sky.  The flames, a hungry orange maw, danced along the ridge line, threatening to consume the already evacuated hillside community of Oakhaven nestled below.  Evie adjusted her helmet, the weight of it a comforting counterpoint to the chaotic dance of fire and shadow before her.  The radio crackled to life in her ear, a dispatcher's strained voice relaying the latest desperate plea for help â€“ a family trapped in their barn, cut off by the advancing inferno.  This wasn't just another wildfire; this was personal.  Oakhaven was where Evie had grown up, where the scent of woodsmoke had once meant cozy fireplaces and roasted marshmallows, not the terrifying prelude to devastation.
