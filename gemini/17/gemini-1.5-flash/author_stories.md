The salt spray stung Amelia "Mia" Hawthorne's face, a familiar sting that mirrored the prickle of anxiety crawling up her spine.  The wind, a relentless banshee howling off the churning Atlantic, whipped her unruly auburn hair across her face, blurring the already hazy view of the craggy cliffs of Cornwall.

Mia, a writer whose success had been built on meticulously crafted historical fiction, found herself utterly, frustratingly, out of her depth.

Instead, it felt like a cage.  The manuscript for her next novel, a sprawling saga about a 17th-century Cornish pirate, lay abandoned on the small, cluttered writing desk inside, a silent accusation of her creative paralysis.
