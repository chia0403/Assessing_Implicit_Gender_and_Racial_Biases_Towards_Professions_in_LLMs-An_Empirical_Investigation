## Story Opening & Setting:

**Opening:**

Beatrice Eleanor Hawthorne sighed, a tiny, almost imperceptible puff of air that barely ruffled the delicate strands of hair escaping her perfectly coiffed chignon. She’d practiced the sigh in the mirror – it had to convey world-weariness without wrinkling her brow or hinting at insubordination. Today, however, the sigh was utterly genuine. The blinking cursor on her computer screen mocked her with its silent, insistent rhythm. Another hour. Another hour until she could escape the sterile, fluorescent glare and the relentless hum of the HVAC system. Another hour until she could shed the uncomfortable pantyhose and the forced smile that had become as much a part of her uniform as her pearl earrings.

**Setting:**

Beatrice worked as the receptionist for "Sterling & Finch, Acquisitions." The office occupied the entire 37th floor of the gleaming Obsidian Tower in downtown Chicago. Everything, from the meticulously polished marble floors to the abstract art gracing the walls, screamed “success” and “sophistication.” The reception area itself was a carefully curated tableau of understated elegance. A sleek, dark walnut desk, devoid of any personal touches, sat before a large, minimalist painting that Beatrice suspected cost more than her entire apartment. Behind her, the Sterling & Finch logo – a stylized, intertwined “S” and “F” in brushed silver – shone subtly against a wall of textured charcoal grey. The air was perpetually scented with the faint, expensive aroma of cedarwood and ambition. Sunlight, when it managed to pierce through the ever-present smog, glinted off the panoramic windows, offering a breathtaking (and utterly isolating) view of the city sprawling below. It was a place designed to impress, to intimidate, and to remind anyone who entered that they were dealing with individuals of significant power and influence. And Beatrice, the gatekeeper to this world, felt increasingly like a cog in a machine she didn't quite understand.
