The scent of lavender and ylang-ylang hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the biting November chill that clawed at the windows of "The Kneaded Relief" spa. Clara Elisabeth Davies, her fingers slick with warm apricot oil, kneaded a knot the size of a robin's egg out of Mr. Henderson's left shoulder blade. He groaned, a sound that could be interpreted as either pleasure or agony; Clara had long since learned to discern the difference.

The spa, nestled on a quiet side street in the picturesque, almost excessively charming town of Havenwood, Connecticut, was Clara's haven as much as it was her clients'. With its exposed brick walls softened by cascading ivy, muted earth tones, and the constant, gentle hum of a water fountain, it was a sanctuary designed to disconnect from the ceaseless noise of the modern world. Clara had inherited it from her grandmother, a woman whose hands were legendary for their ability to heal and soothe. Clara felt a heavy responsibility to maintain that legacy, especially now, with the holiday season rapidly approaching and the weight of expectation settling on the shoulders of Havenwood's residents like early snowfall.
