The Aegean sun, a molten coin in the sky, bleached the whitewashed walls of Santorini to an almost painful brilliance. For Penelope Anastasia Rossi, however, the view from her office window, a postcard-perfect panorama of the caldera, held little joy this Monday morning. Her stomach churned with something more potent than seasickness.

"Delphi Dreamscapes" wasn't exactly crumbling, but Penelope knew the cracks were showing. The internet, with its tempting discounts and instant bookings, was slowly but surely eroding the foundations of her small, fiercely independent agency. The aroma of strong Greek coffee, usually a comforting scent, now felt like a subtle reminder of the dwindling clientele and the mounting bills tucked away in her antique wooden desk.

Penelope pushed the half-eaten spanakopita around her plate, the flaky pastry flaking even further, mimicking the precarious state of her finances. She glanced at the calendar tacked to the wall, a picture of a blissful couple strolling hand-in-hand through a Florentine vineyard. Tomorrow marked five years since Delphi Dreamscapes had opened its doors, five years since she'd gambled everything on her passion for crafting unforgettable travel experiences. The celebration she'd envisioned - champagne, live bouzouki music, maybe even a traditional Sirtaki dance - was rapidly dissolving into the bitter reality of impending closure.
