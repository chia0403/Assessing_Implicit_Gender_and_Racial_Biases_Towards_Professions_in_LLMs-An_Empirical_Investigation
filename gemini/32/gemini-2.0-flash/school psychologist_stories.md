## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights of Meadow Creek Elementary buzzed with a manic energy that mirrored Dr. Eleanor Abigail Davies’ own simmering anxiety. It was Parent-Teacher Conference night, and the air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee, nervous sweat, and the faint, lingering aroma of burnt popcorn from the science fair earlier that week. Eleanor adjusted the nameplate on her desk, straightening it for the tenth time in as many minutes. “Dr. Eleanor Davies - School Psychologist.” It felt more like “Dr. Eleanor Davies - Professional Mediator of Childhood Chaos and Parental Panic Attacks.”

Across the hall, Mrs. Peterson, the second-grade teacher with the perpetually worried frown and a talent for attracting the most… *vibrant*… of students, was already engaged in what appeared to be a heated discussion with a man whose face was rapidly turning the color of a ripe tomato. Eleanor sighed. It was only 6:03 PM. This was going to be a long night.

## Setting:

The story takes place in **Meadow Creek Elementary School**, a modest but well-maintained building nestled in the quiet, suburban town of Oakwood Grove, Illinois. The school prides itself on its "community feel" and its commitment to providing a "holistic education." In reality, it's a pressure cooker of standardized tests, overscheduled children, and parents vying for their offspring's place in the coveted Gifted and Talented program.

Eleanor's office is a small, windowless room tucked away between the nurse's office and the storage closet for the janitorial supplies. She's tried to make it feel welcoming, adorning the walls with colorful children's artwork (mostly gifted by students trying to get out of a counseling session) and a calming landscape print she bought on sale at Target. A plush, overstuffed armchair sits in one corner, intended to soothe the anxious souls who find themselves seeking her help. However, on a night like tonight, it mostly serves as a convenient dumping ground for her overflowing tote bag and a half-eaten bag of trail mix, her fuel of choice for navigating the treacherous terrain of parent-teacher conferences.
