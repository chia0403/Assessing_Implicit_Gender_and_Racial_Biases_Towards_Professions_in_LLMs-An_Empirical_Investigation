## Story Opening:

The faint scent of old paper and lavender hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma Dr. Eleanor Vance had cultivated over years in her practice. Outside, the insistent patter of Seattle rain hammered against the leaded glass windows of her Queen Anne Victorian office, a rhythmic counterpoint to the knot of anxiety currently twisting in her stomach. She straightened the stack of patient files on her mahogany desk, her fingers tracing the worn edges of Amelia Finch's intake form. Amelia Finch. The name felt ominous, a low hum resonating within her gut. Eleanor took a deep breath, trying to center herself, a trick learned during her residency at Bellevue. She was a professional, a doctor. Fear was a luxury she couldn't afford, especially not before she'd even met the patient. Still, there was something about this caseâ€¦ something that prickled the hairs on the back of her neck. The bell above the waiting room door chimed, its delicate melody sounding jarringly cheerful in the gloom. Eleanor rose, smoothed the wrinkles from her tweed skirt, and plastered on her most reassuring smile. "Showtime," she murmured to the empty room, the word lost in the insistent drumming of the rain.

## Setting:

**Dr. Eleanor Vance's Practice, Seattle, Washington:**

* **Location:** A beautifully restored Victorian house in the Queen Anne neighborhood of Seattle. The house stands out amidst more modern architecture, exuding an old-world charm that borders on the gothic.
* **Interior:** The office is decorated in muted tones of green, brown, and cream, creating a calming and serene atmosphere. Antique furniture, Persian rugs, and carefully chosen art pieces (mostly impressionist landscapes) contribute to the feeling of quiet sophistication. The waiting room features comfortable armchairs, a well-stocked bookcase, and a perpetually simmering pot of herbal tea. Eleanor's office is larger, dominated by a massive mahogany desk and a plush leather couch. Bookshelves line one wall, filled with psychology textbooks, research journals, and well-worn novels. The rain is a constant presence, often casting long, eerie shadows throughout the space.
* **Atmosphere:** The setting is intended to evoke a sense of safety, intelligence, and perhaps a hint of melancholy. It suggests that Dr. Vance is a competent and empathetic professional, but also someone who carries a certain weight of experience. The Victorian architecture and the perpetual Seattle rain contribute to an undercurrent of unease, hinting at the darker secrets that might lie hidden within her patients and the city itself.
