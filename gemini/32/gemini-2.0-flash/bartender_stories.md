## Story Opening:

The neon glow of "The Serpent's Coil" pulsed a sickly green onto the rain-slicked street outside. Inside, the air was thick with the mingled scents of stale beer, cheap perfume, and desperation. Bartholomew Finch, his white apron stained with splashes of God-knows-what, wiped down the already-clean mahogany bar with a weary sigh. It was nearing 2:00 AM, the witching hour for the bar's clientele – the lonely, the lost, and those clinging precariously to the fringes of sanity. He'd seen it all behind this bar, from illicit deals unfolding in hushed whispers to tearful confessions spilled over lukewarm whiskey sours. Tonight felt…different. He couldn't quite put his finger on it, but the low hum of the city seemed to vibrate with a restless energy, a premonition that something was about to break.

## Setting:

**The Serpent's Coil** is a dive bar nestled in the heart of Oldtown, a labyrinthine district of crumbling brick buildings and narrow, shadowed alleyways in the sprawling metropolis of Atheria. The bar itself is a haven for the city's underbelly, a place where shadows are welcome and discretion is paramount. The interior is dimly lit, relying mostly on the flickering gas lamps above and the aforementioned neon sign outside. The walls are adorned with faded photographs of boxers and pin-up girls, their smiles offering a stark contrast to the grim faces that usually populate the bar. The floor is sticky with spilled drinks and the lingering residue of countless cigarettes, and the air is perpetually thick with the scent of decay, both literal and metaphorical. In the back, a dusty pool table sits perpetually unoccupied, gathering dust and cobwebs, a testament to the Serpent's Coil's unique brand of solitary misery.
