The biting wind whipped around the corner of the shop, carrying with it the scent of exhaust fumes and the promise of snow. Evelyn "Evie" Riley shivered, pulling her grease-stained Carhartt jacket tighter around her. Inside, the fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune over the rhythmic clanging of wrenches and the low growl of a struggling engine. Evie inhaled deeply, the familiar smell of motor oil and burnt rubber oddly comforting. This was her domain, her sanctuary.

Evie's Garage wasn't much to look at from the outside. A faded sign with peeling paint hung precariously above the double bay doors, and the gravel lot was perpetually littered with abandoned bumpers and rusty engine blocks. But inside, Evie kept things meticulously organized. Her tools hung in perfect rows, each wrench and socket gleaming despite its age. She knew this place like the back of her hand, every dent in the concrete floor, every squeak in the overhead crane.

Evie's full name was Evelyn Marie Riley, and she was the best damn mechanic for a hundred miles in any direction, male or female. She'd inherited the garage from her grandfather, a gruff but lovable old codger who'd taught her everything she knew. Now, ten years after his passing, Evie ran the place single-handedly, catering to the eccentric needs of the small town of Harmony Creek, nestled deep in the Appalachian Mountains of West Virginia. Harmony Creek was a place where time seemed to move slower, where folks still drove beat-up pickup trucks and trusted their neighbors. And they trusted Evie Riley to keep those trucks, and everything else with an engine, running smoothly.
