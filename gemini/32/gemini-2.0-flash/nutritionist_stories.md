## Story Opening:

The flickering fluorescent lights of "Good Grain Goods" cast a sickly yellow glow on the overflowing shelves. Amelia Eleanor Harding, Registered Dietitian, winced and adjusted her glasses. The smell of overripe bananas and something vaguely fermented hung heavy in the air. She'd made a terrible mistake agreeing to come here, even as a "consultant." This wasn't a grocery store; it was a battlefield where healthy intentions went to die a sugary, processed death.

A woman, face tight with suspicion and a shopping basket overflowing with brightly-colored cereal boxes, intercepted her. "You're the nutritionist, right? My Brenda said you're going to tell us everything we're doing wrong."

Amelia swallowed, pasting on a professional smile. "I'm Amelia Harding, yes. And I'm here to help, not judge." She glanced at Brenda, who was currently engaged in a heated debate with a gentleman over the last bag of "Frosted Fantastic Flakes." Help felt like a ridiculously optimistic word at this point.

## Setting:

**Good Grain Goods, a local grocery store in the working-class town of Harmony Creek, Pennsylvania.**

The store prides itself on being a community hub, but is, in reality, a poorly organized jumble of processed foods, discounted snacks, and dwindling produce. The owner, a well-meaning but financially inept man named Mr. Henderson, tries to stock healthy options, but they are often overshadowed by the cheaper, more appealing (and significantly less nutritious) alternatives.

The aisles are narrow and cluttered, the linoleum floor is chipped and stained, and the overall atmosphere is one of perpetual desperation disguised as bargain-hunting. The clientele is a mix of elderly regulars, young families struggling to make ends meet, and teenagers looking for cheap junk food.

Harmony Creek itself is a small, struggling town, its industry having dried up decades ago. Health problems, particularly obesity and diabetes, are rampant, and access to fresh, affordable food is a challenge for many residents.
