## The Setting:

The year is 1938. Dust devils dance down Elm Street in Harmony, Nebraska, leaving a fine grit on the windows of businesses that have seen better days. The Great Depression has gripped the nation, and even in a town as unassuming as Harmony, the struggle is etched on the faces of its residents.  The air hangs thick and heavy with the promise of another scorching afternoon, the kind that makes even breathing feel like work.  

One of the few businesses that still hums with a semblance of life is "The Sharpest Cut," a barbershop distinguished by its faded red and white striped pole and the chipped paint on its window frame. Inside, the scent of bay rum and stale cigar smoke clings to the air, a testament to years of conversations, gossip, and quiet contemplation that have transpired within its walls. The worn leather barber chairs face a long, speckled mirror, reflecting a room that speaks of simpler times, a time before the anxieties of the present had taken root so deeply.

## The Opening:

**Ebenezer Silas Pruitt**, the owner and sole barber of "The Sharpest Cut," squinted at the reflection of his face in the mirror.  He ran a calloused hand over his thinning, grey hair, sighing a breath that seemed to carry the weight of the world.  He was sixty-two years old, and the lines etched around his kind, hazel eyes seemed to deepen a little more with each passing day. He adjusted his spectacles, their wire frames slightly askew, and wondered if he was starting to look more like one of those cracked, leather-bound history books he loved to read.

The shop was quiet this morning, too quiet.  Ebenezer had opened early, hoping to catch the farmers heading into town for supplies, but the only sound so far was the tick-tock of the grandfather clock tucked into the corner, a mournful rhythm that echoed the emptiness in his stomach and in his wallet.  He wiped down the already spotless counter with a damp cloth, trying to ignore the gnawing feeling that the dust storms were only the beginning of Harmony's troubles. Today, Ebenezer Silas Pruitt feared, might be the day The Sharpest Cut would finally lose its edge.
