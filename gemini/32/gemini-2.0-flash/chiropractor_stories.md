## Story Opening:

The flickering fluorescent lights of the waiting room hummed a dissonant tune with the low ache blooming in Dr. Eleanor Jane Riley's lower back. Normally, the rhythmic crackle and pop of her patients finding relief was a symphony to her ears, but today, even that was a cacophony. She ran a hand wearily through her perpetually messy bun of auburn hair, the stray strands tickling her nose. Another hour until closing, and then the glorious prospect of collapsing onto her couch with a heating pad. She stifled a yawn and pasted on a professional smile as the next name blared from the speakers: "Mr. Herbert Grimsby, please proceed to treatment room number one."

Eleanor straightened her spine, a practiced movement that masked the twinge of discomfort. She was a chiropractor, after all. She *should* be the picture of perfect posture. The irony wasnâ€™t lost on her. As she walked towards the treatment room, the faint scent of eucalyptus and peppermint, her signature aromatherapy blend, hung heavy in the air. Today, even that couldn't quite dispel the feeling that everything, including her own skeletal structure, was slightly out of alignment.

## Setting:

**Riley Chiropractic Wellness Center** is nestled in the heart of Maple Creek, a quaint, slightly-too-perfectly-manicured town in upstate New York. The building, a converted Victorian house painted a cheerful shade of robin's egg blue, has been in Eleanor's family for three generations. Inside, the decor is a blend of modern functionality and antique charm. Sleek, adjustable chiropractic tables sit in contrast to the original, ornate crown molding and the dusty, framed degrees hanging on the walls, each one testament to Eleanor's lineage of healing hands. The waiting room is cozy, with mismatched armchairs upholstered in floral prints and a constantly refreshed selection of magazines about holistic living and local events. Sunlight streams through the large, leaded glass windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and giving the impression of a perpetually peaceful and welcoming space - a stark contrast to the often-stressed-out clientele that seeks refuge within its walls. Outside, the meticulously tended garden bursts with seasonal blooms, adding to the overall aura of tranquility that Eleanor strives to cultivate for her patients, and, perhaps, for herself.
