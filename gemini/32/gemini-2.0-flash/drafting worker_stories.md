Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a drafting worker as the main character:

**Setting:**

The late afternoon sun, filtered through the grime-streaked windows of the Atlas Engineering & Construction building, cast long, distorted shadows across the drafting room. The air hung thick with the ghosts of blueprints past, a faint, lingering scent of ammonia and dust. Row upon row of drafting tables, each illuminated by a harsh, adjustable lamp, filled the room, creating a grid of focused light amidst the gloom. The rhythmic scratching of pencils against vellum, punctuated by the occasional sigh of frustration or the rustle of paper, was the room's constant, quiet symphony. Calendars from 1957 still hung on the walls, featuring women in flowery dresses holding vacuum cleaners and men in suits standing proudly next to newly-built homes. This room, though not quite forgotten, felt like a relic, a breathing museum piece struggling to keep pace with the relentless march of progress.

**Opening:**

Clarence Bartholomew Finch, his brow furrowed in concentration, chewed on the end of his pencil, a habit he'd tried, and failed, to break for the better part of thirty years. Outside, Chicago bustled and roared, a symphony of car horns and elevated train screeches, but within the Atlas Engineering drafting room, time seemed to slow, measured only by the slow, deliberate progress of his lines. Today's task: updating the structural plans for the Peterson Building, a tedious endeavor that felt more like archaeological excavation than design. It was an exercise in preserving the legacy of the city, a task he often found more fulfilling than the sleek, modern designs increasingly coming across his drafting table.

He traced the original engineer's shaky lines from the 1920s with meticulous care. Each line, each annotation, was a clue, a whisper from a different era. He added a modern reinforcement steel component to the design when a sudden thought crossed his mind. Why am I doing this? He felt a pull, as if the building itself was whispering in his ear, telling him something he couldn't quite understand. A shiver ran down Clarence's spine despite the warm, stale air. Something was off.
