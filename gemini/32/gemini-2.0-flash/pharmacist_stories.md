The oppressive summer humidity clung to the vinyl of Edgar Bartholomew Finch's pharmacist's stool like a second skin. He sighed, a sound barely audible over the rhythmic whir of the air conditioning unit struggling to maintain a semblance of coolness in Finch's Pharmacy, the only drugstore in the tiny, unincorporated town of Dusty Gulch, Arizona. Outside, the sun beat down on the baked earth, shimmering heat waves rising off the cracked asphalt of Main Street. A tumbleweed, propelled by a stray breeze, bounced past the large window displaying a faded poster advertising Dr. Pepper.

Edgar, 57, balding with a perpetually worried crease etched between his eyebrows, idly rearranged the bottles of antacid on the shelf behind the counter, each label meticulously aligned. It was Tuesday, which usually meant a trickle of regulars needing their blood pressure medication, maybe a tourist desperately seeking relief from sunburn, and the inevitable Mr. Henderson complaining about the price of his denture adhesive. Quiet, predictable, and utterly uninspiring.

He glanced at the clock above the aspirin display. 3:17 PM. Almost quitting time. Almost time to escape the fluorescent hum of the pharmacy and retreat to his little cottage on the outskirts of town, where he could lose himself in the tranquility of his stamp collection and forget, for a few precious hours, the slow, agonizing decay of Dusty Gulch. He just hoped nothing unexpected would come through that door. Because in Dusty Gulch, unexpected always meant trouble.
