Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a butcher, including their full name:

**Story Opening:**

The smell of sawdust and iron-rich blood hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume that clung to Edgar Alistair Finch like a second skin. He’d been breathing it since he was knee-high to a cleaver, since his father first hoisted him onto a rickety stool behind the counter of Finch & Sons Meats, teaching him the secrets of the sirloin and the poetry of a properly trimmed flank. Now, decades later, the scent was less a profession and more a memory woven into the very fabric of his being. But this morning, something was different. A cloying sweetness, almost sickly, lingered beneath the usual smells, a note that scraped against Edgar’s senses like a dull blade against bone. He frowned, wiping his hands on his blood-stained apron and scanning the empty shop, his brow furrowed in a silent question only the meat itself could answer.

**Setting:**

The story is set in the small, perpetually grey coastal town of **Port Blossom, Maine**, in late October. Finch & Sons Meats, the butcher shop owned and operated by Edgar, sits on the main (and practically only) street, wedged between "The Salty Knot" bait shop and "Agnes' Knick-Knacks." The building itself is old, with faded white paint peeling to reveal the gray wood beneath. Salt air has weathered the window frames, and a rusty, hand-painted sign hangs above the door, depicting a slightly cartoonish cow. The shop's interior is functional and spartan. White-tiled walls are perpetually chilled, and the display case gleams under harsh fluorescent lights, showcasing a careful selection of cuts: roasts, steaks, sausages, and the occasional wild game brought in by the local hunters. A thick, scarred butcher block sits behind the counter, where Edgar spends most of his days, wielding his cleaver with practiced precision. The back room is a chaotic jumble of saws, grinders, and hooks, the air thick with the lingering scent of past harvests. Outside, the roar of the Atlantic and the mournful cry of gulls are ever-present sounds, a constant reminder of the unforgiving beauty of the Maine coast.
