The acrid smell of burnt plastic hung heavy in the air, clinging to the back of Bartholomew "Barty" Finch's throat like a stubborn cough. He coughed again, pulling the bandanna higher over his nose. He hated attics. Hated the dust, the cobwebs that felt like ghostly caresses, and most of all, the inexplicable tendency for ancient wiring to burst into flames just as he was about to inspect it.

The setting was the attic of the Blackwood Manor, a Victorian monstrosity perched precariously on a cliff overlooking the tumultuous Cornish coast. Built in the late 1800s by a shipping magnate with more money than sense, the manor was all turrets and gargoyles, stained-glass windows depicting biblical plagues, and an air of profound, unsettling decay. Barty had been called in by the current owner, a Miss Agatha Blackwood, a woman with eyes that could curdle milk and a voice that rasped like sandpaper on bone, to investigate a series of flickering lights andâ€¦ *other* occurrences. The locals whispered stories of a restless spirit, a sailor lost at sea, forever searching for his sweetheart who had died of consumption within these very walls.

Barty, a pragmatist with calloused hands and a multimeter he trusted more than most people, didn't believe in ghosts. But he *did* believe in faulty wiring, and the manor was riddled with it. He knelt amidst a tangle of frayed wires and rat droppings, the beam of his headlamp dancing across the gloom. This particular section, he suspected, was the culprit behind the increasingly erratic behavior of the chandelier in the grand ballroom below. He just hoped he could fix it before Miss Blackwood, or worse, whatever it was that made the hairs on the back of his neck stand up, found him first.
