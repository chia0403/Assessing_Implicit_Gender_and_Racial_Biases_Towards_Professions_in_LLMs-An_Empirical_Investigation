## Story Opening and Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The hum was back. Eleanor Vance groaned, pushing her greasy forelock off her forehead with the back of her hand. It wasn't a loud hum, not yet. Just a faint thrumming, like a nervous bee trapped in a glass jar. But Eleanor knew that hum. It was the precursor to static, to garbled broadcasts, to the creeping silence that always threatened to engulf the isolated outpost. And the silence, she knew, was far more terrifying than any storm the Alaskan wilderness could throw her way.

She adjusted the magnifying glass perched on her nose and leaned closer to the aging vacuum tube in her hand, its filament glowing a sickly orange. This damned Westinghouse 1918 was the heart of the long-range transceiver, the only link between her and the outside world, and it was clearly on its last legs.  "Come on, you stubborn piece of history," she muttered, her breath fogging slightly in the frigid air of the shack. "Just a little longer, alright? Just until the resupply plane gets here."

**Setting:**

The story takes place in a remote, abandoned US Army outpost, hastily reactivated during the Cold War. It's nestled deep within the unforgiving Alaskan interior, circa 1962.  The outpost, designated "Echo Station," is a cluster of dilapidated wooden barracks, a mess hall riddled with dry rot, and a crumbling communications shack where Eleanor spends most of her time.

The landscape is a brutal, breathtaking expanse of snow-covered mountains, frozen forests, and wind-swept plains.  The sky is a permanent canvas of grey, punctuated by fleeting moments of vibrant aurora borealis.  Temperatures regularly plummet below freezing, and blizzards can trap the outpost for days, cutting off all visibility and communication.

Echo Station is isolated and lonely, a testament to a forgotten fear and a symbol of the lengths humanity will go to in the name of security.  The ghosts of past soldiers, lost in the icy grip of the Alaskan wilderness, seem to linger in the shadows of the decaying buildings.
