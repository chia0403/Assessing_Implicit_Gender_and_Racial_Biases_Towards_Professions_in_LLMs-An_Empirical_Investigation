The scent of disinfectant wipes and Crayola wafted through the air, a comforting, if slightly artificial, aroma to Miss Eleanor Willowbrook, known affectionately as Miss Ellie by her charges. It was 7:45 AM, and the pre-dawn stillness of Autumn Ridge Elementary School was slowly giving way to the vibrant chaos she both dreaded and adored.

The setting was her kindergarten classroom, a colorful explosion of primary colors and miniature furniture. The walls were plastered with construction paper turkeys, their googly eyes staring blankly ahead, a relic from the previous week’s Thanksgiving festivities. A well-worn rug depicting a farm scene dominated the center of the room, ringed by twenty small, plastic chairs. Sunlight, filtering weakly through the frosted windowpanes, illuminated dust motes dancing in the air. Outside, the skeletal branches of a maple tree clawed at the overcast sky, a stark contrast to the hopeful, blossoming atmosphere Miss Ellie strived to create within her four walls. In moments, the door would burst open, unleashing a flurry of tiny shoes, oversized backpacks, and a symphony of excited, and sometimes tearful, greetings. Today, however, felt different. A strange, almost imperceptible, hum permeated the air, a tension that pricked at the edges of Eleanor’s usually unflappable calm.
