The midday sun, relentless even in late October, beat down on the tin roof of the cabana, making Amelia Beatrice Harding question her sanity. She, a lifelong New Yorker, was supposed to be experiencing the joys of a writer's retreat in the Yucat√°n Peninsula, a place lauded for its "healing energy" and "inspiring natural beauty." Instead, she was sweating through her linen pants, battling a swarm of mosquitos the size of hummingbirds, and staring at a blank laptop screen with the same level of enthusiasm one might reserve for a root canal.

The retreat itself was a collection of brightly painted, palm-thatched cabanas nestled into a sliver of beach a good hour's drive south of Tulum. The air hung heavy with the scent of salt, decaying seaweed, and something vaguely floral that Amelia suspected was a strategically placed air freshener trying to mask the less appealing smells. Turquoise water, the very color of a postcard, lapped listlessly at the shore, but the promised tranquility was constantly interrupted by the screeching of exotic birds and the rhythmic thumping of a nearby construction site where yet another eco-resort was being erected, presumably to offer future writers the very same "healing energy" Amelia was so desperately seeking.
