The chipped ceramic mug warmed Amelia Beatrice Blackwood's hands, a small comfort against the perpetual damp that clung to her bones in this corner of Cornwall.

She took a long sip of her lukewarm tea, the familiar floral scent doing little to soothe the anxiety knotting her stomach. Another day, another blank page, another wave of self-doubt threatening to pull her under, just like the unforgiving sea outside her window.
