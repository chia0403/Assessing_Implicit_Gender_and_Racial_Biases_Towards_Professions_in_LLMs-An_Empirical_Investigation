## Story Opening:

The biting Himalayan wind whipped around Dr. Aris Thorne, stinging his cheeks even through the thick yak wool scarf. He squinted, his breath clouding the air, as he surveyed the scene before him: a cluster of stone huts clinging precariously to the mountainside, nestled beneath a jagged, unforgiving peak perpetually shrouded in snow. This was Kyirong, the last village before the border with Tibet, and, judging by the frantic waving of the small boy rushing towards him, his services were desperately needed. The boy, no older than ten, tugged at Aris's sleeve, babbling in a language he barely understood, but the urgency in his wide, fearful eyes transcended the language barrier. He followed the boy, each step a careful negotiation with the treacherous, ice-slicked path, a knot of dread tightening in his stomach. Another life in the balance, another impossible choice to make in a place where modern medicine felt a million miles away. He adjusted the weight of his battered medical bag, the worn leather familiar and comforting against his gloved hand, and braced himself for whatever awaited him.
