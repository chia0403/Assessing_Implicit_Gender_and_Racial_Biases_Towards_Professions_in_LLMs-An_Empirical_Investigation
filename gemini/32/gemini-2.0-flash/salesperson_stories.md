## Story Opening:

The humid Atlanta air hung thick and heavy as Bartholomew "Bart" J. Finch wiped the sweat from his brow, leaving a smear of sunscreen across his forehead. He adjusted his tie, a garish pattern of paisley and pelicans, and plastered on a smile that felt more like a grimace. It was Tuesday, and Tuesdays meant door-to-door sales in the affluent suburb of Buckhead.

Today's mission? Convincing reluctant homeowners they desperately needed Bartholomew Finch's revolutionary (and arguably overpriced) lawn care system, the "Verdant Vitalizer 5000," a machine that promised golf-course-worthy lawns with minimal effort. Bart wasn't sure he believed in the damn thing himself, but his mortgage payment loomed large, and his boss, a man with a smile as sharp as a freshly honed scythe, had made it abundantly clear that excuses were about as useful as a screen door on a submarine. He just hoped Mrs. Hawthorne, whose meticulously manicured azaleas practically screamed, "Keep off the grass!" wasn't home today. She'd chased him off with a garden hose last month.

**Setting:**

The story opens on a sweltering summer day in Buckhead, a wealthy residential area in Atlanta, Georgia. The streets are lined with sprawling, well-manicured lawns, imposing brick houses with multi-car garages, and the occasional glimpse of a sparkling blue pool. The air is thick with the scent of blooming jasmine and the constant drone of cicadas. The houses are separated by meticulously maintained hedges and wrought-iron fences, creating an atmosphere of both affluence and guarded privacy. It's a place where appearances matter, and keeping up with the Joneses is a full-time occupation. The sun beats down mercilessly, reflecting off the pristine sidewalks and making even walking a chore.
