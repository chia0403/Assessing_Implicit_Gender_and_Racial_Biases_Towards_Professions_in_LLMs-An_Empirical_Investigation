## Story Opening:

The bell above the door of "Silas Thorne, Bespoke Tailor" tinkled a nervous melody as a gust of wind bullied its way into the shop. Silas, his mouth full of pins, barely registered the intrusion. He was too busy wrestling a stubborn length of tweed, its subtle heather tones mocking his efforts to coax it into the perfect curve for Lord Ashworth’s riding jacket.

He mumbled around the pins, “Blast it all, stubborn as a Highland goat!” He shifted the fabric, adjusted the chalk marks, and held his breath, willing the tweed to cooperate. Just as he was about to plunge his shears into the unforgiving cloth, a voice, crisp and laced with the impatience of privilege, cut through the air.

"Mr. Thorne? Silas Thorne, I presume?"

Silas carefully removed the pins from his mouth, depositing them into the small pincushion perched on his lapel, and rose, smoothing down his own well-worn tweed waistcoat. He knew that voice. Trouble was, he knew.

## Setting:

Silas Thorne’s shop, "Silas Thorne, Bespoke Tailor," was nestled on a quiet side street in the bustling market town of Market Harborough, Leicestershire, England. The year was 1888.

The shop itself was a testament to Silas's meticulous nature. Sunlight streamed through the large, dust-moted window, illuminating rows of neatly arranged fabric bolts: Irish linen, Italian wool, thick corduroy, and the aforementioned stubborn tweed. Spools of thread in every conceivable color lined shelves above the worktable, a testament to his discerning eye.

A Singer sewing machine, a formidable black beast, sat perched on a sturdy oak table, its treadle worn smooth by years of use. Scattered around it were remnants of past projects: buttons like polished jewels, scraps of silk in vibrant hues, and half-finished garments draped on dress forms, silently awaiting his expert touch. The air was thick with the comforting aroma of beeswax, freshly ironed linen, and the faint, lingering scent of the pipe tobacco Silas favoured in the evenings.

The walls were lined with framed sketches and fashion plates, offering glimpses into the evolving world of men's attire. A large, antique mirror hung opposite the entrance, reflecting the organized chaos of the shop and occasionally, the anxieties mirrored in Silas's own weary eyes. It was a space where tradition and artistry intertwined, a haven for those who appreciated the enduring elegance of a perfectly tailored garment.
