The clatter of silver trays laden with half-eaten croissants and lukewarm coffee echoed in the vast, cathedral-like lobby of the Grand Majestic Hotel. Dust motes danced in the beams of sunlight that pierced through the arched windows, illuminating the faded grandeur of the once-opulent space. The smell of old money, mingled with the faint antiseptic scent of cleaning products, hung heavy in the air.

It was in this grand, yet slightly decaying, setting that **Bartholomew Reginald Finch**, his back a permanent curve from years of carrying luggage, navigated the polished marble floors. Bartholomew, or Bart as he preferred to be called, although few outside the kitchen staff ever bothered, adjusted his faded maroon uniform, the brass buttons tarnished and dull. He smoothed down the thinning hair he religiously combed over his balding head. He was a bell hop, and he was damned good at it, even if the “damned good” days of the Grand Majestic were long gone. Today, he was on duty, and that meant a smile, a crisp "Welcome to the Grand Majestic!" and a tip, hopefully a generous one, to help pad out his meager wages.
