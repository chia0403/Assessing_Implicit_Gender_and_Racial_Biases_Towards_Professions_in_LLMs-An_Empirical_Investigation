## Story Opening:

The crows were early that morning, their raucous cawing slicing through the pre-dawn stillness like a dull blade. Elias Thorne, farmer and reluctant insomniac, was already halfway through his first cup of lukewarm coffee, staring out at the indigo canvas that stretched over his fields. A light mist clung to the ground, promising a damp, chilly start to the day. He squinted, trying to discern the shapes emerging from the gloom â€“ the hulking silhouettes of his barns, the crooked spine of the old oak that marked the boundary of his land, the promise of a harvest clinging to the corn stalks swaying gently in the breeze. He just hoped that promise wouldn't be a broken one. Last year's drought had taught him a brutal lesson in the capricious nature of the land, and the gnawing worry that he hadn't learned it well enough kept him perched on the edge of his chair, poised for a fight against fate.

## Setting:

The story is set in the heart of the American Midwest, specifically in rural Iowa, in the late summer of 1935. Dust and hardship cling to the land like the ever-present humidity. Elias Thorne's farm, a modest spread inherited from his father, is called "Thorne's Hope" - a name that feels increasingly ironic as the weight of the Depression presses down. The farm itself consists of several weathered barns, a small but functional farmhouse with a porch that sags a little to the left, and rolling fields of corn and soybeans that stretch towards the horizon. The nearest town, Harmony Creek, is a dusty crossroads with a general store, a struggling bank, and a population slowly dwindling as people abandon their dreams for the promise of a better life elsewhere. The air is thick with the scent of earth and ripening crops, but also carries the undertones of desperation and a lingering unease about what the future holds.
