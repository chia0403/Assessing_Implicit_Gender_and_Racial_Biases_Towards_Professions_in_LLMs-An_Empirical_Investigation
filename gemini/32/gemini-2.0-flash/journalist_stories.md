## Story Opening:

The insistent chirping cut through the humid Louisiana air like a rusty saw blade. Eleanor Grace Moreau, a journalist for the Baton Rouge Advocate, groaned and fumbled for her phone on the nightstand, knocking over a half-empty glass of sweet tea in the process. Sticky droplets bloomed across the worn wooden surface.

“Ugh,” she muttered, finally silencing the alarm. 5:00 AM. A truly unholy hour, even for someone whose job description regularly involved chasing fire trucks and badgering politicians. But today, it wasn’t a story she was chasing, it was a ghost.

Eleanor pushed herself upright, the faded floral quilt clinging to her like a humid shroud. Today, she was going home.

## Setting:

Eleanor’s bedroom in the Garden District of Baton Rouge was a testament to controlled chaos. Bookshelves overflowing with dog-eared novels and journalism textbooks lined one wall, vying for space with framed photographs of her late parents and a collection of vintage typewriters she’d inherited from her grandfather, a man she barely remembered but who, according to family lore, had been a legendary reporter in his day.

Sunlight, filtered through the lush foliage of magnolias outside the window, cast dappled shadows on the mismatched furniture. A sturdy oak desk, inherited from her grandmother, was piled high with research papers, notebooks filled with scribbled notes, and empty coffee mugs. The overall impression was one of a mind constantly churning, overflowing with ideas and stories waiting to be told.

Outside, the sounds of the city were beginning to stir: the distant rumble of a garbage truck, the melodic chimes of a bicycle bell, the raucous call of a mockingbird perched atop a live oak tree. But within the confines of her cluttered, sun-drenched room, Eleanor Grace Moreau was momentarily shielded from the world, bracing herself for the journey back to the past.
