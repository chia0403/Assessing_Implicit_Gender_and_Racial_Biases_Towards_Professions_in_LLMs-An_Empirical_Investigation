Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a dental hygienist as the main character:

**Setting:** The pristine, almost sterile, atmosphere of "The Smiling Pearl Dental Clinic," nestled in the burgeoning arts district of Asheville, North Carolina. Sunlight streams through the oversized windows, illuminating the dust motes dancing in the air, making the room feel somehow less antiseptic and more…alive. The walls are a calming shade of seafoam green, adorned with locally sourced artwork featuring abstract representations of teeth (surprisingly tasteful). Soft jazz music plays from the hidden speakers, attempting to soothe the nerves of patients waiting in the plush, ergonomic chairs of the reception area.

**Story Opening:**

The faint, metallic tang of blood hung in the air, a scent Beatrice Marguerite Dubois knew intimately. She barely registered it anymore, too focused on the meticulous work in front of her. "Almost done, Mr. Henderson," she said, her voice soft and reassuring, masked only slightly by the surgical mask covering the lower half of her face. Her gloved hand, steady and precise, danced around the molars of her patient, deftly wielding the ultrasonic scaler. Mr. Henderson, a retired history professor with a surprisingly stubborn amount of tartar buildup, grunted in response, his eyes tightly shut against the bright overhead light.

Beatrice paused, flicking a speck of water from her protective eyewear. She’d been staring at teeth for the better part of a decade, and you'd think she'd be used to it. Yet, each mouth was a new landscape, a unique topographical map carved by genetics, diet, and life’s little traumas. And sometimes, like with Mr. Henderson, she saw echoes of her own… not the traumas, thankfully, but the weariness. A deep-seated ache that resonated in the bone-deep fatigue she felt after a long day of scraping, polishing, and probing. Today, though, was different. A new patient was coming in this afternoon, and a quick glance at the appointment log revealed that they hadn't been to a dentist in years. Beatrice sighed inwardly; she braced herself for the inevitable…and the stories that often came with the decay.
