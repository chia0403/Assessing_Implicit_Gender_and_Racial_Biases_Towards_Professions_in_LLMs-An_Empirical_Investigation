The biting wind, a snarling January beast, clawed at the thin fabric of Michael Anthony DiMarco's gloves as he scaled the scaffolding. His breath puffed out in ragged white clouds, disappearing almost instantly into the steel-grey sky that hung heavy over the city. The skeletal frame of the Grand Majestic Tower, a future beacon of luxury apartments and high-end retail, loomed around him like a metal leviathan, its bones still exposed to the elements.

This wasn't just any construction site, it was *the* construction site. Everyone in Chicago, hell, maybe even the Midwest, knew about the Grand Majestic. It was supposed to be the tallest residential building outside of New York City, a symbol of the city's unwavering ambition and booming economy. Michael, a man who typically preferred the quiet satisfaction of laying brick on a cozy bungalow to the grand theatrics of skyscraper construction, had gotten on the crew for one reason: the money. His daughter, Sophia, was starting college in the fall, and the Grand Majestic promised a paycheck fat enough to cover her tuition and then some.

The setting was Chicago, specifically the rapidly gentrifying River North neighborhood. Gleaming glass towers and trendy restaurants were popping up like mushrooms after a rainstorm, pushing out the old, gritty character of the area and replacing it with sterile modernity. The Grand Majestic, a monument to this transformation, stood at the edge of the Chicago River, its reflection shimmering in the murky water below, a stark contrast to the aged brick warehouses that stubbornly clung to their historical roots just a few blocks away. The city’s constant hum of traffic and construction was a symphony of progress, or at least, that’s what the brochures promised. Michael, clinging to the icy scaffolding, felt a pang of something closer to unease.
