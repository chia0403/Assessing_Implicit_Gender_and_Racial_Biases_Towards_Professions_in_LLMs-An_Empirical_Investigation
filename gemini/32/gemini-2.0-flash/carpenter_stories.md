The biting scent of pine resin and the rhythmic rasp of sandpaper filled the air of the small, sun-drenched workshop. Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light that pierced the gloom, illuminating the fine lines etched around Silas Bartholomew's eyes as he meticulously smoothed the edge of a mahogany plank. Outside, the quaint coastal town of Port Blossom was slowly waking; the cry of gulls mingled with the distant clang of the ferry bell, marking the start of another bustling market day.

Silas, however, remained lost in his craft. He was a carpenter of considerable renown in Port Blossom, his hands capable of coaxing beauty and function from the most stubborn of woods. He built everything from sturdy fishing skiffs to delicate, intricately carved rocking horses, each piece bearing the unmistakable mark of his patient skill and quiet devotion. But today, the rhythmic labor was less a solace and more a distraction from the heavy weight that sat upon his heart. He was building a coffin. And not just any coffin. It was for Mrs. Hawthorne, the kind old woman who had always slipped him extra cookies at the bakery and whose laughter had been a constant, comforting presence on Harbor Street. He hated every nail, every joint, every perfectly smoothed surface. Each precisely placed detail felt like a betrayal of the vibrant life he was trying to encapsulate. Port Blossom, usually a haven of tranquility and salty air, felt oppressive, suffocating him with its reminders of a life that was now tragically, irrevocably changed.
