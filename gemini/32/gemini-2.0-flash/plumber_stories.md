The stench hit Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins like a brick wall the moment he opened the basement door. It was a thick, cloying miasma of stagnant water, mildew, and something vaguely…organic. He wrinkled his nose, pulling his blue baseball cap lower over his bushy eyebrows. He'd been a plumber in the quiet, coastal town of Port Blossom, Maine, for twenty-three years, and you'd think he'd be immune to foul odors by now. You'd be wrong.

Port Blossom itself was a picture postcard: brightly painted houses clinging to the rocky coastline, a harbor bustling with lobster boats, and air that usually smelled of salt and pine. The kind of place where everyone knew your name, your business, and how many times you'd sneezed that week. It was usually peaceful, almost boring. 

But Mrs. Abigail Weatherby’s century-old Victorian mansion, perched precariously on the cliffs overlooking the churning Atlantic, was anything but peaceful. Its peeling paint, overgrown ivy, and the perpetually mournful cry of the gulls circling overhead, gave it an air of gothic gloom that even Bart, a man of logic and pipes, found a little unsettling. Mrs. Weatherby, a wiry woman with eyes as sharp as broken glass and a voice that could shatter porcelain, had called him this morning in a panic. “The most ghastly gurgling noises, Mr. Higgins! And the smell! I believe it’s the spirits…or perhaps something even worse!”

Bart didn’t believe in ghosts, but he believed in clogged pipes. And right now, standing on the top step of the musty, cobweb-draped basement, he had a feeling he was about to encounter something far more terrifying than any apparition. This was going to be one for the record books.
