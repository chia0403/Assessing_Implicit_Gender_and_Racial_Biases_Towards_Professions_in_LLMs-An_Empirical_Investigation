## Story Opening:

The biting wind whipped off the Sea of Whispers, a salty spray stinging Caius Aurelius’s face as he wrestled with the slab of granite. He braced his calloused hands against the cold stone, muscles straining beneath his thick woolen tunic. The rhythmic *thock-thock* of his chisel against the unforgiving surface echoed across the desolate cliffs, a lonely counterpoint to the crashing waves below. He hated winter. It seeped into your bones, numbed your fingers, and made even the most familiar tasks feel like a Sisyphean ordeal.

Caius spat a globule of phlegm onto the grey, already dust-covered ground. He’d been working on this particular piece for three days now, and still the relief wouldn’t yield. It was a commission for Lord Marius, the wealthiest landowner this side of the Tiber, and the demanding old goat wanted a likeness of his beloved, though horribly ugly, pug, Pugnacious. Caius suppressed a sigh. Nobleman and his grotesque dog, both a thorn in his side. He'd much rather be carving the likeness of a god, or even a humble shepherd, but a man had to eat, and stonecutting rarely brought in enough coin to be choosy.

## Setting:

The story unfolds on the wind-swept, rocky coastline of Ostia Antica, an ancient Roman port city near the mouth of the Tiber River. Caius's workshop is a simple, ramshackle structure built into the cliff face, offering meager protection from the elements. The walls are constructed of roughly hewn stones, and the roof is patched with sun-bleached canvas. Tools of his trade are scattered around: chisels of varying sizes, mallets worn smooth with use, whetstones dulled by countless sharpenings, and a crude wooden stool where he rests his aching back. Outside, the view is dominated by the churning grey sea and the towering cliffs dotted with sparse, gnarled pines. Further inland, the ruins of the once-grand port city are slowly being reclaimed by nature, a silent testament to the passage of time and the ephemerality of human ambition. The air is thick with the smell of salt, damp stone, and the faint, persistent aroma of woodsmoke from nearby dwellings.
