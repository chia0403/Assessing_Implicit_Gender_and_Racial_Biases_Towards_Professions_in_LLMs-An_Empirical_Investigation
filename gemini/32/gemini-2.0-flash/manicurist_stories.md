## Story Opening:

The scent of acetone hung in the air, a sharp counterpoint to the sugary sweetness emanating from Mrs. Gable's lemon-drop perfume. Seraphina Isabelle Rossi sighed, expertly smoothing a layer of OPI’s “Big Apple Red” over Mrs. Gable’s already perfectly manicured thumbnail. Mrs. Gable, with her pillowy hands and a voice that could curdle cream, was Seraphina’s first client of the day, and already Seraphina felt the hum of anxiety building in her chest like a faulty fluorescent light.

"You know, Seraphina," Mrs. Gable chirped, her diamond ring glinting under the salon’s bright lights, "Bernie saw Harold Fenwick just yesterday at the club. Harold said his niece, Tiffany, is getting married in Tuscany! Tuscany! Imagine!"

Seraphina forced a smile. "Sounds lovely, Mrs. Gable."

Lovely. That was precisely what Seraphina’s own life was not. She was teetering on the edge of something, she could feel it, a tightrope stretched taut between her dreams and the overwhelming pressure of her reality. The tiny, precise strokes she was making with the brush felt like the only thing keeping her grounded. One wrong move, one jitter of her hand, and she might just shatter into a million tiny pieces, like the chipped nail polish bottle she’d accidentally dropped last week.

## Setting:

**Seraphina works at "The Gilded Lily," a small, somewhat pretentious nail salon located on a bustling, tree-lined street in the affluent suburb of Willow Creek, Connecticut.** The salon is all pale pinks and golds, with crystal chandeliers hanging precariously low over the manicure stations. Each station is equipped with a plush, velvet chair, a magnifying lamp, and a plethora of nail polishes neatly arranged in rainbow order. The waiting area features a plush, floral-patterned sofa and copies of "Vogue" and "Harper's Bazaar" piled high on a glass-topped coffee table. The overall atmosphere is one of hushed luxury and quiet gossip, punctuated by the whir of the nail drills and the occasional high-pitched giggle. Through the large windows, Seraphina can see the carefully manicured lawns of Willow Creek, a constant reminder of the life she desperately craves but feels perpetually out of reach. The back room, where supplies are stored and employees take their breaks, is a stark contrast - cramped, cluttered, and smelling strongly of bleach. It’s a haven of sorts, a place where Seraphina can escape the polished facade and just be herself, even if it's only for a few minutes at a time.
