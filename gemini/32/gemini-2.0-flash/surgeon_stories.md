The pre-dawn light, a bruised purple bleeding into the inky black, barely penetrated the thick blinds of Dr. Vivian Holloway’s apartment. Even so, she could feel it, an insistent pressure against her eyelids, mirroring the pressure building behind them. She hadn’t slept more than two hours, plagued by a recurring nightmare – a sterile operating theater filling with blood, her scalpel slipping in her gloved hand.

Vivian dragged herself out of bed, the silk sheets clinging to her like a shroud. The air was thick with the lingering scent of chamomile tea and the sterile perfume of exhaustion. Her apartment, a minimalist haven on the 27th floor overlooking the steel and glass canyons of downtown Chicago, felt less like a refuge this morning and more like a gilded cage. 

Below, the city was just beginning to stir, the rumble of delivery trucks and the distant wail of a police siren a discordant symphony that echoed the chaos in her own mind. She walked to the panoramic window, the cold glass pressing against her forehead. In a few hours, she would be at Mercy General Hospital, facing another surgery, another life hanging precariously in her hands. The weight of that responsibility felt heavier than usual today, a crushing burden threatening to steal the last vestige of her resolve.
