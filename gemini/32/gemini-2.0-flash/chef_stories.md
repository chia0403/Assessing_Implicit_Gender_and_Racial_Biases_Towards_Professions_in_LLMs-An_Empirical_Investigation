The clatter of pots and pans, usually a symphony to Chef Isabelle Marie Dubois' ears, felt like a discordant, agonizing dirge this morning. Sun, the relentless, blinding Mediterranean sun, poured through the expansive windows of the kitchen at "Le Poisson Volant," staining the stainless steel surfaces a brassy orange.

But not today. Today, it only reminded her of the empty chairs at table four, reserved every Saturday night for Madame and Monsieur Bouchard, a couple as intertwined with the fabric of Le Poisson Volant as the seaweed paintings on the walls.
