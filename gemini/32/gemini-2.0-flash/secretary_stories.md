The fluorescent lights of Dunder Mifflin Scranton hummed a monotonous drone, a sound that had become as familiar to Prudence Eleanor Higgins as the clack of her own keyboard. It was a Tuesday, meaning the coffee was stale and the complaints were fresh. Prudence, perched at her desk like a diligent but weary sparrow, surveyed the landscape of her domain. Papers piled precariously on Michael Scott's desk, forming a beige avalanche waiting to happen. Stanley Hudson buried deep in his crossword, muttering darkly about "seven letters for 'despair'." Dwight Schrute, the self-proclaimed Assistant Regional Manager, was pacing the hallway, barking orders into his Bluetooth headset â€“ likely imaginary orders from imaginary clients.

Prudence sighed, adjusting the slightly crooked nameplate that read "Assistant to the Regional Manager." She knew, better than anyone, that she was *actually* the Regional Manager's assistant, the keeper of the schedule, the protector against unwanted solicitors, and the woman who somehow, inexplicably, found herself cleaning up glitter glue spills after impromptu office "talent shows." She straightened her sensible cardigan, took a deep breath of the recycled air, and prepared for another day in the chaotic kingdom of Dunder Mifflin.
