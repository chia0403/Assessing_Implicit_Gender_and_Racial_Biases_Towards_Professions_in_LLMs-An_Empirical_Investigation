## Story Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

The stale, recycled air hit Amelia Elizabeth Carter square in the face as she ducked out of the galley of Air Paradise Flight 302 to Honolulu. A wave of heat, thick and heavy with the scent of suntan lotion and damp earth, washed over her, a palpable reminder that they had finally arrived. She inhaled deeply, savoring the brief respite before the chaos of deplaning began. A small, secret smile played on her lips. Honolulu was always a welcome sight, even after the six hundred and thirty-seventh time sheâ€™d landed here. It was her escape, her little slice of paradise, even if it was only for a twenty-four-hour layover.

**Setting:**

The scene unfolds on the tarmac of Daniel K. Inouye International Airport in Honolulu, Hawaii. The Boeing 777-200 is parked a respectable distance from the terminal, connected by a brightly-lit jet bridge. The late afternoon sun casts long shadows across the asphalt, painting the airport vehicles and ground crew in hues of orange and gold. Palm trees sway gently in the background, visible just beyond the chain-link fence that separates the active airfield from the rest of the airport property. The air hums with the low thrum of other planes taxiing, taking off, and landing. The noise, usually grating, is somehow softer here, almost muted by the ever-present sound of the ocean, a distant, rhythmic whisper carried on the warm breeze.
