The sterile, minty scent of the office was a familiar, unwelcome comfort to Dr. Eleanor Marie Ainsworth. Outside, a relentless drizzle painted the windows of her practice on Elm Street, a melancholy grey that mirrored the patient file clutched in her hand. "Mr. Harold Grumbly," she read, the name almost a caricature. Harold Grumbly. It suited the grumbling emanating from exam room two perfectly.

Dr. Ainsworth, Ellie to her close friends (a dwindling number these days), had established "Ainsworth Dental: A Smile You Can Trust" ten years ago, envisioning a sanctuary of pearly whites and pain-free experiences. Instead, it felt more like a battlefield. Elm Street, once a charming avenue of boutiques and bakeries, had slowly succumbed to the insidious creep of discount chain stores and dollar pizza joints. The rising cost of rent meant she was one of the last independent businesses clinging to its quaint, albeit increasingly dilapidated, façade. The chipped paint on the door, the slightly faded floral wallpaper inside – they were constant reminders of her dwindling profits and the increasing pressure to sell out and relocate to a soulless strip mall on the outskirts of town.
