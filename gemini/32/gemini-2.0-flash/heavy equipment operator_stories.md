Okay, here's a story opening with a heavy equipment operator as the main character:

**Story Opening:**

The Nevada sun, a merciless inquisitor, beat down on the cab of the Cat D11T bulldozer. Dust devils, miniature cyclones of sand and despair, danced on the horizon, mocking the already stifling air. August in the Mojave was a brutal mistress, and Jedediah Bartholomew “Barty” Crane knew it well. He could taste it in the grit between his teeth, feel it in the sting of his sweat-soaked bandana, and see it shimmering on the cracked dashboard.

Barty adjusted his mirrored sunglasses, the kind preferred by highway patrolmen and guys who spent their days wrestling multi-ton machines across the earth. He squinted at the GPS coordinates flickering on the console. Just another mile to the demarcation point. He tightened his grip on the control levers, the well-worn steel cool against his calloused hands. Another mile closer to uncovering what lay buried beneath centuries of desert silence. Another mile closer to maybe, just maybe, proving that he wasn't crazy for believing in the old legends.

**Setting:**

The story is set in the **Mojave Desert, Nevada**, specifically in a remote and relatively untouched area designated for a controversial new solar energy project. This project, ironically, required the leveling of vast swaths of land, essentially undoing centuries of natural processes. The landscape is a harsh, arid expanse of sand, scrub brush, rocky outcroppings, and the occasional Joshua tree clinging to life. The air is hot, dry, and often filled with dust and the scent of creosote. The nearest town, a dwindling mining outpost called Silver Gulch, is a few hours away by truck, a place where the past feels as present as the relentless sun. The construction site itself is a noisy, chaotic environment, a stark contrast to the surrounding stillness of the desert, with the constant rumble of heavy machinery, the crackle of radios, and the shouts of construction workers echoing across the barren landscape.
