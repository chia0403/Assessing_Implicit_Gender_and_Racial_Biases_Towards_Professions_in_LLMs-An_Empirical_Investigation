## Story Opening:

The midday sun beat down on Arthur "Art" Bellweather's back with the fervor of a vengeful god. Sweat, thick and salty, trickled down his forehead, stinging his eyes despite the perpetually stained bandana he wore. He paused, momentarily, balanced precariously on the crest of the roof of Mrs. Henderson's Victorian monstrosity. Below, the world shrunk: cars became toy-like, the manicured lawns of Willow Creek blurred into a swathe of vibrant green. Up here, though, the only reality was the scorching shingles, the clatter of his hammer, and the nagging voice in his head that sounded suspiciously like his late father.

"Too much dawdling, Arthur," it boomed, even in death. "A roof ain't gonna fix itself, now is it?"

Art sighed, the sound lost in the wind. He knew his father was right, as always. A leaky roof meant a damp ceiling, and a damp ceiling meant angry customers. And Art Bellweather, roofer and reluctantly ordained successor to Bellweather Roofing, had enough angry customers as it was.

## Setting:

The story is set in **Willow Creek, a small, affluent town nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains in North Carolina.** The town is characterized by its manicured lawns, sprawling Victorian houses, and a pervasive sense of Southern gentility. While appearing idyllic on the surface, Willow Creek hides a undercurrent of gossip, secrets, and quiet desperation beneath its perfectly painted facades. The local economy revolves around tourism, catering to retirees and weekenders seeking a peaceful escape from the city. The older generation, like Mrs. Henderson, cling to tradition and the established order, while the younger generation often feels stifled by the small-town atmosphere and yearns for something more. The surrounding mountains, visible from almost every point in town, serve as a constant reminder of the wildness and untamed beauty that lies just beyond the manicured borders of Willow Creek. The year is 2023.
