The chalkboard, a smudged battlefield of fractions and phonics, glared back at Miss Eleanor Beatrice Ainsworth. The harsh fluorescent lights of Room 3B, usually buzzing with the boundless energy of twenty-three seven-year-olds, felt particularly desolate on this Saturday afternoon. Eleanor sighed, pulling a stray strand of her auburn hair, escaping her haphazard bun, behind her ear. The air hung heavy with the scent of disinfectant and construction paper, a peculiar and unsettling combination. Sunlight, pale and weak, filtered through the dusty windows, casting long, dancing shadows of the half-finished gingerbread houses decorating the back table. The Parent-Teacher Association's "Gingerbread Gala" was next week, and Eleanor, designated Gingerbread Coordinator, was knee-deep in powdered sugar and edible glitter, a task she'd vastly underestimated. Each tiny candy cane roof, each gumdrop button, represented another hour spent away from grading papers and prepping for Monday's spelling test. Eleanor loved her students, she truly did, but right now, all she felt was a sugar-induced headache and the creeping suspicion that her classroom was slowly transforming into a gingerbread wasteland.
