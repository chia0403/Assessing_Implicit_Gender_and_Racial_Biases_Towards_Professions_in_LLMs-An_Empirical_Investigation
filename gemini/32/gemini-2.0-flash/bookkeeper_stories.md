The fluorescent lights of "Dusty & Sons Wholesale Plumbing Supplies" hummed a monotonous tune, a fitting soundtrack to the mountain of invoices threatening to bury Eleanor Penelope Ainsworth alive. The air in her tiny, windowless office was thick with the scent of dust and the faint, lingering aroma of yesterday's microwaved tuna casserole. She was nestled on the second floor of the warehouse, accessible only by a creaky metal staircase that announced every visit with the auditory equivalent of a rusty scream. Outside her door, the thrum of forklifts and the shouts of burly men loading and unloading trucks punctuated the silence, a constant reminder of the physical, grease-stained world she only glimpsed through inventory reports.

Eleanor Penelope Ainsworth, a woman whose life largely revolved around meticulously balancing debits and credits, adjusted her spectacles. She was a creature of habit, a devotee of order in a chaotic world. Her grey cardigan was perpetually buttoned to the top, her sensible brown shoes neatly aligned under her desk, and her brown hair was always pulled back into a severe, yet undeniably practical, bun. The world of plumbing held little allure for Eleanor. She preferred the silent conversation between numbers, the satisfying click of a well-placed decimal point, the quiet victory of a perfectly balanced ledger. But Dusty & Sons was a job, and in the quiet town of Harmony Creek, jobs were as rare as a dry spell in July.
