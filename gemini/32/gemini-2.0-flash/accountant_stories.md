The fluorescent lights of Klein & Sterling hummed, a monotonous drone that mirrored the calculations circling in Arthur Pennyworth's head. He sat at his desk, its surface a meticulously organized chaos of spreadsheets and tax codes, a small oasis of order in the larger, more chaotic accounting firm. Outside, the Chicago wind howled a mournful tune against the towering glass buildings, a stark reminder of the biting January chill. Snow, now more slush than snow, clung to the window panes, obscuring the already dim winter daylight.

Arthur, a man whose life seemed to revolve around debits and credits, adjusted his tie, a maroon and navy blue pattern he'd picked out specifically for its subtle, yet professional, appeal. At forty-two years old, he was the senior junior accountant - a title that felt both prestigious and frustratingly permanent. He’d hoped to be further along by now, maybe a junior partner at least, but Arthur excelled at meticulousness, not ambition. He was a master of the numbers, a silent guardian of the firm's financial integrity, but lacked the cutthroat charisma necessary to climb the corporate ladder. Today, though, the usual anxieties were overshadowed by a different sort of unease. He had a meeting with Mr. Sterling himself later this afternoon, and while he hadn't been given the specifics, his gut, which was usually as reliable as his calculator, told him it wasn’t going to be a pleasant one.
