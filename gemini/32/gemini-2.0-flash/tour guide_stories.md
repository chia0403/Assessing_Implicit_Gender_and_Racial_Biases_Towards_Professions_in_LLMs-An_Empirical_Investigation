The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of frangipani and exhaust fumes as Anya Petrova adjusted her headset, the plastic warm against her temple. She smoothed down the creaseless emerald linen dress she wore – a silent prayer that it wouldn't immediately stain with dust or, God forbid, bird droppings – and plastered on her most engaging smile. Today's tour was "Hidden Gems of Hoi An," a curated experience promising a glimpse behind the postcard perfection of the Vietnamese coastal town.

Anya, whose full name was Anya Anastasia Petrova, hadn’t initially envisioned her life taking her to Southeast Asia. Five years ago, she'd been buried in dusty archives at St. Petersburg State University, chasing the ghost of forgotten revolutionaries. Now, she was chasing the fleeting attention spans of sunburned tourists armed with selfie sticks.

Her gaze swept across the small group milling about at the edge of the shimmering Thu Bon River. There was a young couple, already bickering over the best angle for a photo with the Japanese Covered Bridge looming in the background; a gaggle of boisterous retirees clutching guidebooks the size of bricks; and a lone, surprisingly stylish woman in a wide-brimmed hat who gave Anya a knowing smile.

This was it. Another day, another carefully crafted narrative, another chance to peel back the layers of this fascinating city for a few hours. She hoped, as always, to offer them more than just pretty pictures; she wanted them to feel the thrumming heartbeat of Hoi An, to taste its vibrant soul. She just hoped they wouldn't ask too many questions about the specific species of the decorative lanterns. That was always her weak point.
