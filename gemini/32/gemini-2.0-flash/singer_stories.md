The stale, citrusy tang of disinfectant clung to the air in the waiting room, a stark contrast to the velvet curtains and glittering chandeliers Ariana Bellweather was used to.

This was the waiting room of the Northwood Institute for Vocal Rehabilitation, a modest, brick building tucked away on a quiet, tree-lined street in upstate New York. The walls were painted a soothing, yet clinical, shade of pale green. A water cooler gurgled in the corner, and a stack of outdated magazines sat untouched on a small, scarred coffee table. A single, struggling fern clung to life in a ceramic pot on the windowsill, a pathetic mirror of Ariana's own faltering career. This wasn't the spotlight; this was the purgatory for broken voices, and Ariana Bellweather was next in line for judgment.
