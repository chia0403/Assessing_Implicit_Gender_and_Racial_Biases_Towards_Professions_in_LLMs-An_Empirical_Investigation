## Story Opening:

The scent of burnt coffee and regret hung heavy in the air, thick enough to taste. Dust motes danced in the weak morning sun slanting through the grime-streaked windows of the "Last Chance Diner."  Lorraine "Rain" Bellweather wiped down the sticky counter for what felt like the millionth time that morning, the worn vinyl squeaking in protest. Her back ached, her feet screamed, and the fluorescent lights hummed a discordant tune that drilled into her skull.  Outside, the highway whispered promises of somewhere, anywhere, but inside, Rain was stuck.  A semi rumbled past, shaking the diner's foundation, and she sighed, a puff of stale cigarette smoke escaping her lips.  Five more hours. Five more hours until she could peel off her stained apron, scrub the grit from under her fingernails, and maybe, just maybe, forget the hollow ache that had settled deep within her. 

## Setting:

The Last Chance Diner was a relic from a bygone era, a greasy spoon clinging desperately to the edge of Highway 40, about twenty miles south of Cedar Creek, Nebraska.  Its chrome facade, once gleaming, was now pitted and dull, the neon sign flickering erratically, the "C" in "Chance" permanently burned out.  Inside, the red vinyl booths were ripped and patched with duct tape, the formica tabletops etched with generations of spilled coffee rings and bored graffiti.  A chipped tile floor, stained a perpetual muddy brown, groaned under the weight of countless weary travelers and locals alike.  Behind the counter, a stainless steel grill hissed and popped, spitting grease and the promise of artery-clogging delights.  A faded photograph of a smiling family, circa 1970, hung crookedly above the cash register, a silent testament to a time when the diner was thriving, a time Rain could barely imagine.  The air was a constant blend of frying bacon, stale coffee, and the faint, lingering odor of desperation.
