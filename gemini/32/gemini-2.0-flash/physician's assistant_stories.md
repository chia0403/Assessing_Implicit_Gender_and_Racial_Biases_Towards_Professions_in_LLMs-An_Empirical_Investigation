Okay, here's a story opening, setting, and introduction to the main character:

**Setting:**

The biting wind whipped across the exposed parking lot of the St. Jude's Rural Clinic in Havenwood, Montana. Snow, not quite a blizzard but stubbornly determined, swirled around the headlights of Amelia Hayes' aging Subaru. The clinic itself was a low, prefabricated building that seemed to huddle against the landscape. Its paint, a faded beige that was supposed to evoke serenity, looked more like surrender under the harsh winter sky. A single string of Christmas lights, stubbornly clinging to life, blinked weakly above the entrance. Inside, the scent of antiseptic and simmering coffee battled for dominance, a familiar aroma that usually offered a sense of comfort, but tonight, only added to the sense of a long, lonely night ahead.

**Story Opening:**

The scream, thin and reedy, cut through the relative quiet of the clinic. Amelia Hayes, Physician's Assistant, nearly dropped the half-eaten apple she was gnawing on. It wasn't an unusual sound in a clinic that served a population with more than its fair share of farming accidents and backwoods mishaps. But this scream, this one had a desperate, ragged edge that sent a chill crawling up her spine.  She tossed the apple core into the overflowing trash bin and pushed away from her desk, her chair scraping loudly against the linoleum. "Betty?" she called out, her voice calm despite the knot tightening in her stomach. "What's going on out there?" There was no reply, only the continued, escalating wail. Amelia grabbed the emergency kit from the wall, her fingers automatically checking its contents even as she sprinted towards the reception area. Whatever was happening, it wasn't good.
