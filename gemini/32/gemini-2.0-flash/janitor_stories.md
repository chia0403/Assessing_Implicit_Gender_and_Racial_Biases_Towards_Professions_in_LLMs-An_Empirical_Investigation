## Opening:

The hum of the industrial floor buffer was a lullaby to Silas Bartholomew Finch. Not a particularly melodic lullaby, perhaps, but one that soothed him all the same. He pushed the machine back and forth across the polished marble floor of the Grand Atrium, the bristles whirring, devouring dust motes and the ghosts of hurried footsteps. He was a master of his domain, the custodian of this glittering space. And, at precisely 3:00 AM on a Tuesday, he was utterly alone.

## Setting:

The Grand Atrium of the Zenith Corporation Headquarters was a testament to aspiration and unchecked ambition. Located on the 70th floor of the building, it boasted panoramic views of the city, though Silas rarely glanced at them. The city never slept, a constant pulse of light and noise, whereas his sanctuary - the Atrium, at least - was finally still.

The space was dominated by a colossal sculpture of intertwined steel and glass, supposedly representing the synergistic potential of the company. To Silas, it looked like a metallic squid trying to escape a collapsing skyscraper. Around the sculpture were meticulously arranged groupings of minimalist furniture in shades of grey and chrome. Walls lined with abstract art, canvases of furious colour splatters, completed the look of calculated grandeur. Even at this hour, the air was faintly scented with the corporate-approved fragrance, a blend of citrus and something faintly metallic, that always reminded Silas of lemon-scented cleaning fluid.
