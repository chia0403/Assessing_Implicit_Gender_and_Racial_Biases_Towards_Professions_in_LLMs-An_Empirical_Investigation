Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a main character who is a groundskeeper:

**Setting:**

The setting is Blackwood Manor, a sprawling estate nestled deep within the misty hills of the Scottish Highlands. The manor itself is a gothic masterpiece, built of dark grey stone and crowned with imposing turrets and gargoyles. Generations of the Blackwood family have lived and died within its walls, leaving behind whispers of history, both grand and tragic. Surrounding the manor are acres of meticulously kept gardens – a wild, untamed beauty tamed and shaped by human hands. There are rose gardens brimming with fragrant blooms, sculpted hedges that twist and turn into labyrinthine paths, and ancient, gnarled trees that seem to watch over the estate with silent wisdom.  A thick, ever-present fog often clings to the grounds, adding an air of mystery and isolation to the already dramatic landscape.

**Story Opening:**

The first hint of dawn painted the eastern sky a bruised purple as Alistair MacLeod, his breath puffing out in white clouds, began his rounds at Blackwood Manor. The chill air bit at his cheeks, and his gloved fingers ached as he wrestled with the latch of the old potting shed.  He'd been tending these grounds for twenty years, longer than most of the current Blackwood family had even been alive, and every creak of the gate, every rustle of leaves, was as familiar to him as his own heartbeat. He liked the early hours best. Before the tourists arrived to gawk at the history, before the staff bustled about their duties, and most importantly, before Lady Blackwood began her daily inspection of the rose garden, looking for the slightest imperfection. This time was his. A time for quiet reflection, for communion with the plants and the earth that he loved. Today, however, a feeling of unease settled in his stomach as he walked towards the main gate. The fog was thicker than usual, swirling and obscuring the stone lions that guarded the entrance. It wasn't the kind of fog that brought peace. It was a fog that whispered secrets. A fog that felt like something was watching, something old, something…hungry.
