The pre-dawn air in Harmony Creek hung thick and heavy, clinging to everything like a damp shroud. A chorus of crickets chirped a melancholic farewell to the dying night as Detective Isabella “Izzy” Rodriguez trudged across the dew-kissed grass of Mrs. Hathaway’s prize-winning rose garden. She winced with each step, the delicate blooms brushing against her worn leather boots, a sharp contrast to the grim reality unfolding before her.

Harmony Creek, usually a haven of perfectly manicured lawns and neighborly gossip, had been jolted awake by the gruesome discovery. The body of Mayor Thompson, sprawled amongst the prize-winning hybrid teas, his face a frozen mask of terror beneath the milky light of the still-rising moon.

Izzy pulled out a small notepad, the faint glow of her flashlight illuminating the blank page. Harmony Creek. Population: 3,212. Violent crime rate: Practically nonexistent. Until now. This wasn’t just a crime; it was an earthquake in a teacup, a shattered reflection of the idyllic image the town so fiercely guarded. She took a deep breath, the scent of roses mixing with the metallic tang of blood, a cocktail that churned in her stomach. Detective Isabella Rodriguez, thirty-four years old, with a divorce behind her and a career stalled somewhere between ambitious and competent, was about to have her peaceful little corner of the world turned upside down. And she had a feeling it was going to be ugly.
