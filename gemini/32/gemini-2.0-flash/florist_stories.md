The chipped ceramic mug warmed Amelia Isabella Rossi's hands as she watched the dawn bleed across the sky. The sky, a bruise-purple slowly giving way to bruised-peach, was reflected in the rain-slicked cobblestones of Via dei Fiori – Flower Street. Amelia, however, was less impressed with the romantic vista and more concerned with the persistent dampness seeping into her worn leather boots.

Her shop, "Fiori di Amelia," nestled amongst the other businesses on the bustling street, was currently shrouded in the pre-dawn quiet. A gentle glow emanated from within, cast by the single lamp she'd left burning, illuminating rows of patiently waiting bouquets. The air hung thick with the perfume of hyacinths, the earthy scent of damp moss, and the sharp tang of eucalyptus.

Via dei Fiori was a microcosm of Rome itself – ancient and modern, chaotic and beautiful. Laundry hung precariously from wrought-iron balconies overhead, the vibrant colors a jarring contrast to the crumbling stucco walls. The rhythmic rumble of early morning delivery trucks competed with the chirping of the neighborhood's resident pigeons, a discordant symphony that Amelia had grown to love. It was home. It was her haven. And it was about to be invaded by the early morning rush of customers, each with their own unique story, their own reason for seeking the solace and beauty that only flowers could provide.
