## Story Opening & Setting

**Setting:** The vast, unforgiving landscape of Big Bend National Park, Texas, nestled against the Rio Grande. The sun beats down mercilessly on the cracked earth, turning the air thick and hazy. Jagged mountains claw at the sky, their slopes sparsely dotted with cacti and scrub brush. The only sounds are the incessant buzz of cicadas, the mournful cry of a hawk circling overhead, and the occasional rattle of loose rocks tumbling down a distant cliff.

**Opening:**

Dust swirled around Jedediah "Jed" Silas Thorne's worn leather boots as he surveyed the parched land. The sun, a malevolent eye in the vast Texas sky, beat down on him, baking the sweat into his weathered face. He spat, the brown juice disappearing quickly into the thirsty soil. Another week without rain and he’d be forced to make a choice he didn't want to make: sell off half his herd. The Thorn Ranch, passed down through generations, had weathered droughts before, but this one felt different. This one felt… personal. Jed swiped a grimy hand across his forehead, leaving a trail of red dust in its wake. He squinted towards the shimmering horizon, a knot of anxiety tightening in his gut. Something was coming. He could feel it in the dry, stagnant air, in the uneasy silence of the land. He just didn't know what.
