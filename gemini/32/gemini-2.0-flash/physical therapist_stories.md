## Story Opening and Setting:

**Story Opening:**

The slam of the clinic door rattled the glass partition separating physical therapy from reception. Sarah, bless her heart, had a habit of punctuating her arrival with the force of a summer thunderstorm. Amelia Grace Hawthorne sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose. It was Monday, the start of a long week, and her first appointment, Mr. Henderson with his perpetually aching lower back, was already ten minutes late. Amelia glanced at the skeletal model perched precariously on the corner of her desk, a silent sentinel guarding the battlefield of strained muscles and stiff joints. Maybe she should invest in a helmet for him.

**Setting:**

The story unfolds primarily within the walls of "Restore & Revive Physical Therapy," a privately owned clinic located in the heart of a bustling, but slightly faded, coastal town in Maine called Port Blossom. The clinic itself occupies the ground floor of a renovated Victorian building, its original charm fighting a losing battle against the sterile necessity of medical equipment. Sunlight streams through large, arched windows, highlighting dust motes dancing in the air and casting long shadows across the linoleum floor.

The interior is divided into three distinct areas: a small, somewhat cluttered reception area staffed by the perpetually flustered Sarah; a larger, open gym area equipped with treadmills, resistance bands, weights, and various other torture devices designed to rebuild strength and mobility; and two private treatment rooms, each containing a therapy table, a computer workstation, and a collection of anatomical charts and oddly comforting scented candles. The air usually smells faintly of disinfectant, mingled with the sweet aroma of Sarahâ€™s perpetually brewing herbal tea and the faint, ever-present tang of the nearby ocean. Outside, the sounds of seagulls, foghorns, and the rhythmic crashing of waves serve as a constant reminder of Port Blossom's salty, sea-worn existence.
