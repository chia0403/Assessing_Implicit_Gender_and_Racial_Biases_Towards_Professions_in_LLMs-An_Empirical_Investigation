Okay, here's a story opening and setting:

**Story Opening:**

The scent of stale potpourri and desperation hung thick in the air of 314 Willow Creek Drive, clinging to the faded floral wallpaper and the suspiciously damp carpet.  Margaret Evelyn Sterling, realtor extraordinaire (at least, thatâ€™s what her business cards proclaimed), took a deep breath, ignoring the protesting wheeze in her lungs, and pasted on a smile bright enough to power a small city.  "Charming, isn't it?" she chirped, her voice echoing slightly in the cavernous, empty living room.  She gestured vaguely towards the chipped fireplace mantle, where a family of dust bunnies had clearly taken up permanent residence.  "Imagine the Christmases you could have here!"

Truthfully, Margaret imagined more likely scenarios:  black mold, collapsing ceilings, and a hefty bill for whatever ungodly plumbing lurked behind the walls.  But this was her job.  This was how she paid for her expensive taste in antique teacups and her crippling addiction to true crime podcasts.  And, damn it, she was going to sell this house, even if she had to invent a ghost with impeccable taste.

**Setting:**

The story is set in the small, slightly down-on-its-luck town of Havenwood, nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains in western North Carolina.  Havenwood was once a bustling logging town, but its glory days were long gone.  Now, it's mostly known for its antique shops, a surprisingly vibrant (if small) art scene, and the persistent rumor that Elvis Presley once hid out here after faking his death.  Margaret operates out of a small, somewhat dilapidated office above "Granny's General Store" on Main Street.  The real estate market in Havenwood is sluggish, primarily driven by retirees looking for a quiet escape and a few adventurous young families drawn to the lower cost of living. 314 Willow Creek Drive is located in the older, less desirable part of town, known locally as "Whispering Pines", a neighborhood filled with neglected gardens and houses that have seen better days.
