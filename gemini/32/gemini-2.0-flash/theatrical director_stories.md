## Story Opening:

The scent of dust and dried roses clung to the air in the Grand Majestic Theatre, a familiar perfume to Alistair Finch. He stood alone in the cavernous space, the light filtering through the stained-glass dome painting rainbows across the velvet seats. Rehearsals were over for the day, the cast and crew dispatched to their respective homes, leaving Alistair with the quiet company of his thoughts and the echoing silence of a stage that had seen better days. 

Tonight, however, the silence felt heavier, pregnant with a disquiet Alistair couldn't quite place. Perhaps it was the weight of expectation hanging over the upcoming premiere of his adaptation of "The Raven," a production that had already bled him dry of money, patience, and seemingly, inspiration. Or maybe, he thought, stroking his neatly trimmed beard, it was the feeling that he wasn't truly alone. He could almost feel the ghostly presence of the theatre's legendary, and notoriously critical, former owner, Mrs. Beatrice Blackwood, peering down from her old box seat, ready to deliver her stinging judgment. Alistair shivered, despite himself. 

## Setting:

The story takes place in **present-day London**, primarily within the walls of the **Grand Majestic Theatre**. The theatre itself is a grand, but decaying, landmark. Once a vibrant hub of the London theatre scene, it has fallen into disrepair in recent years. The velvet seating is worn and threadbare, the ornate plasterwork chipped and faded, and the lighting system temperamental at best. The air hangs heavy with the scent of dust, old wood, and a faint hint of bygone glamour. Despite its dilapidated state, the Grand Majestic retains a certain charm and a palpable history. The dressing rooms backstage are cramped and cluttered, filled with forgotten props and costumes, each with a story of its own. The theatre is located in a slightly overlooked corner of the West End, struggling to compete with the flashier, more modern venues nearby.
