The salt spray kissed Élodie Marguerite Dubois' face as she wrestled with the easel. The wind, a notorious bully on the Île de Groix, threatened to rip her canvas right out of its supports and send it tumbling into the turbulent, slate-grey sea below. She gritted her teeth, digging her heels into the rough, gorse-covered cliff edge. The air tasted of iodine and impending rain.

Élodie, a woman whose face was etched with the history of a life spent under the Breton sun and whose hands were permanently stained with the vibrant hues of her palette, refused to be deterred. This was her spot. This wild, windswept corner of the island, where the relentless waves crashed against the jagged rocks, was where she found her inspiration.

Below, the old lighthouse, Phare de Pen Men, stood sentinel against the angry sky, its whitewashed walls gleaming faintly even under the oppressive cloud cover. This lighthouse, more than any other landmark on the island, held the key to Élodie’s soul, a silent witness to her triumphs and her heartbreaks, her loves and her losses. She tightened her grip on the brush, its bristles worn smooth from years of use, and dipped it into a glob of cobalt blue, ready to capture the tempestuous beauty before her. Today, she would paint the storm, and perhaps, in doing so, she could finally paint away the ghosts that haunted her.
