Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Isabella "Izzy" Diaz's office, a staccato rhythm accompanying the mournful saxophone solo crackling from the vintage radio perched precariously on a stack of dusty case files.  Her office, nestled above a laundromat on Bleecker Street in the heart of Greenwich Village, New York City, was small, cramped, and perpetually smelling faintly of detergent and stale coffee.  The peeling paint on the walls and the overflowing ashtray on her desk testified to long nights fueled by cheap diner coffee and even cheaper cigarettes.  Izzy, a woman of sharp angles and even sharper wit, stared out at the neon-slick streets, the city lights blurring through the rain-streaked glass.  It was a Thursday night in November, the kind of night that clung to you like a damp shroud, and the kind of night that usually brought trouble to her door.  Tonight was no different.  A sharp rap echoed through the room, followed by the creak of the door as a figure emerged from the dimly lit hallway.
