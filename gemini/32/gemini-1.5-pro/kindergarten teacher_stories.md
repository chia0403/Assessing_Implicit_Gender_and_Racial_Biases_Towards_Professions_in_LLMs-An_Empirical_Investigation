The insistent California sun, already high and hot even at 8:00 am, beat down on the brightly colored plastic play equipment outside Mrs. Eleanor Vance’s kindergarten classroom. Tiny handprints, some faded by rain and time, others vibrant and fresh, dotted the window through which Eleanor watched her students navigate the miniature world of slides, swings, and a precarious-looking plastic castle.  Room 5, affectionately known as the “Rainbow Room” due to Eleanor’s penchant for vibrant displays and the student-painted rainbow mural spanning one entire wall, was located at the far end of Sunnyside Elementary, tucked against a fragrant grove of eucalyptus trees. The air, thick with the scent of eucalyptus and sunscreen, hung heavy with the promise of another scorching summer day. Inside, the remnants of the morning's pre-playground frenzy – scattered blocks, half-finished drawings, and abandoned toy trucks – lay strewn across the colorful rug, waiting patiently for the return of their small owners.
