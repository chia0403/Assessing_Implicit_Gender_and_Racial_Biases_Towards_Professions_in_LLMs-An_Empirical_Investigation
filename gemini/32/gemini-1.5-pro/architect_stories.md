The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, stinging Amelia Reyes’s cheeks as she surveyed the skeletal frame of the Saltwick Tide House.  Grey clouds scudded across the sky, mirroring the turbulent, slate-coloured water crashing against the cliffs below.  Salt spray hung in the air, coating everything in a fine, gritty film, including Amelia’s thick, wool-lined parka.  The house, perched precariously on the edge of the Yorkshire coastline near Whitby, was her most ambitious project yet – a testament to sustainable architecture, designed to harness the raw power of the tides.  But today, as the steel girders groaned against the relentless wind, Amelia felt a knot of unease tighten in her stomach.  It wasn't just the weather.  Something about the site, something beyond the predictable challenges of building on such an exposed location, felt…off.  Almost as if the cliffs themselves were whispering secrets she wasn’t meant to hear.
