The biting wind whipped off the North Sea, carrying the scent of salt and something vaguely metallic, clinging to Elias Thorne's thick wool coat.  He hunched deeper into the collar, his breath clouding the frosty air as he trudged across the shingle beach towards the looming silhouette of Orford Ness Lighthouse. January on the Suffolk coast was a brutal mistress, and 1953 was proving no exception.  Elias, his toolbox clanking rhythmically against his leg, was already regretting the thick mug of tea he'd forfeited to make this early morning call.  The lighthouse keeper, a grizzled old salt named Silas, had reported a persistent crackling interference on the emergency radio beacon, a problem that couldn't wait for fairer weather. The isolated spit of land, a desolate finger of shingle and marshland stretching out into the grey expanse of the sea, was known for its capricious weather, and the forecast hinted at a gathering storm.  The lighthouse, a solitary sentinel against the gathering gloom, was Elias's sole destination, and for now, his entire world.
