The insistent London drizzle seemed to mirror the relentless thrum of Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's headache.  It was a Tuesday, the kind that felt like a Monday’s hangover, and the neon glow of Soho advertising signs reflected off the slick cobblestone streets.  Amy, hunched against the damp chill in a worn leather jacket, pushed open the heavy glass door of “Brew & True,” a tiny cafe crammed between a vintage clothing store and a suspiciously vibrant adult shop.  The bell above the door jingled a discordant welcome as she stepped inside, the aroma of burnt coffee and something vaguely floral assaulting her senses.  Her messenger bag, overflowing with design drafts and half-eaten granola bars, thumped against her hip as she navigated the cramped space, her eyes scanning for an empty table amidst the mismatched furniture and overflowing bookshelves. Brew & True wasn't glamorous, but it was cheap, close to her tiny studio apartment above a falafel shop, and offered a relatively reliable Wi-Fi connection – the lifeblood of a freelance graphic designer in the heart of London's creative chaos.
