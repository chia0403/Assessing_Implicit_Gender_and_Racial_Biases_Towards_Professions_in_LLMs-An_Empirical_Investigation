The biting wind whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne, stinging his cheeks and rustling the dead leaves clinging to the oak trees lining the long drive. November in the Hudson Valley had a stark, melancholic beauty, all bare branches and iron-grey skies. Elias pulled his threadbare scarf tighter around his neck, the wool scratching against his beard, and trudged towards the sprawling Victorian house that served as both his home and the Cedar Hill Veterinary Clinic.  The porch light cast a warm, inviting glow against the gathering gloom, a beacon against the encroaching night and the unsettling quiet that had settled over the valley in recent weeks. It was a quiet that went beyond the usual stillness of late autumn; a silence that hummed with an almost palpable tension, making the hairs on the back of Eliasâ€™s neck prickle with unease.
