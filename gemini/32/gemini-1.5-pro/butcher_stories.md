The fluorescent lights of "Chop Shop Charlie's," buzzing like trapped wasps, cast a sterile, bluish glow over the refrigerated cases.  Fat beads of condensation clung to the shrink-wrapped packages of prime rib and pork loin, shimmering like misplaced jewels.

He wasn't a poet, not by a long shot, but even Elias could appreciate the grim poetry of a butcher shop at 5:00 am, just before the town began to stir.
