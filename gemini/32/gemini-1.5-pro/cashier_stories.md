The flickering fluorescent lights of the Quick Stop buzzed in a monotonous rhythm, a soundtrack to Amelia “Amy” Rodriguez’s Tuesday night. Rain lashed against the single windowpane beside her register, blurring the neon glow of the “Open 24 Hours” sign. The Quick Stop, nestled uncomfortably between a laundromat and a bail bondsman on the outskirts of bleak, grey Grimsborough, wasn't glamorous, but it paid the bills.  Amy tapped her chipped, cherry-red nails against the worn countertop, the scent of stale coffee and hot dogs clinging to the air like a second skin.  At 11:57 pm, the bell above the door chimed, its shrill jingle momentarily breaking the oppressive silence.  Amy plastered a practiced, weary smile on her face, ready to greet Grimsborough’s latest night owl.
