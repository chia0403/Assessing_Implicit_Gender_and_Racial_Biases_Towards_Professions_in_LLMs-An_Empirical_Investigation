Rain lashed against the windows of the Quonset hut clinic, a relentless drumming that mirrored the anxiety churning in Amelia Reyes’ stomach.  The wind howled like a banshee, rattling the flimsy metal structure that served as the only medical outpost for miles in the isolated Alaskan fishing village of Port Blossom.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and fish, a peculiar combination that Amelia had grown strangely accustomed to over the past year.  She glanced at the battered clock on the wall: 11:47 pm.  Another late night. Outside, the storm raged, and with it, a new emergency was brewing. The radio crackled to life, a frantic voice cutting through the static, “…Mayday…Mayday…fishing vessel *The Wanderer*…taking on water…need immediate medical assistance…”  Amelia’s hand instinctively went to the small silver cross she always wore around her neck.  Tonight, it felt less like a symbol of faith and more like a lead weight.
