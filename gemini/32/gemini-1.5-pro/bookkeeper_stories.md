The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Bartholomew "Barty" Finch's bookkeeping office, a rhythmic drumming that mirrored the nervous flutter in his stomach.  His office, tucked between a pawnbroker and a perpetually smoky chiropractor's clinic on Grimshaw Lane, wasn't much to look at.  Dust motes danced in the weak light filtering through the grime-streaked window, illuminating rows of meticulously organized ledgers and a chipped porcelain bust of Benjamin Franklin, Barty’s unlikely muse. Grimshaw Lane itself, a narrow artery in the heart of the perpetually overcast city of New Birmingham, was a study in urban decay – a place where flickering neon signs cast an eerie glow on crumbling brick facades and the air hung thick with the smell of exhaust fumes and desperation.  Today, however, the usual melancholic hum of the Lane was punctuated by an unusual tension, a palpable sense of anticipation that prickled Barty’s skin and made him wish he’d stayed home with a pot of tea and his beloved copy of “Debits and Credits for Dummies.”  He’d just finished reconciling Mrs. Higgins’ haberdashery accounts – a task made considerably more challenging by her insistence on paying in buttons and hatpins – when a sharp rap at the door made him jump.
