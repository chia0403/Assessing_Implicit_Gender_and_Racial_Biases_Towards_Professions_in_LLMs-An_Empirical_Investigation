The insistent California sun, filtered through the gauzy curtains, painted stripes across Amelia Reyes's face. She blinked awake, the lingering scent of lavender and eucalyptus clinging to her like a second skin.  Her small bungalow, perched on the hillside overlooking the sleepy coastal town of Cypress Cove, was usually a sanctuary.  This morning, however, the usual tranquility felt fragile, stretched thin by the persistent hum of anxiety that had become her unwelcome companion. Amelia, whose full name was Amelia Sofia Reyes, swung her legs out of bed, the worn wooden floor cool beneath her bare feet.  She ran a hand through her tangled dark hair, already dreading the day ahead.  It wasn't the clients â€“ Amelia genuinely loved her work as a massage therapist, finding solace in easing the knotted muscles and stressed minds of others.  It was the unsettling quiet in Cypress Cove, a quiet that had descended like a thick fog after the disappearance of old Mrs. Henderson, a woman whose lavender-scented garden was just a stone's throw from Amelia's own.
