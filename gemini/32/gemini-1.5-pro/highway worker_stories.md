The biting pre-dawn chill seeped through Elias Vance’s orange work vest, making the thin fabric feel like a cruel joke against the November wind. Frost crunched under his steel-toed boots as he trudged along the shoulder of Interstate 80, just east of Rawlins, Wyoming. The vast, ink-black sky, speckled with a million indifferent stars, stretched out above the rolling plains, broken only by the jagged silhouettes of the distant Seminoe Mountains. The only sounds were the low hum of his own breath, the whisper of the wind, and the occasional whoosh of a semi-truck hurtling through the darkness on its cross-country journey. Elias’s breath plumed in the frigid air, each exhale a small, ephemeral rebellion against the encroaching winter.  His job this morning:  replace a series of damaged reflector posts along a two-mile stretch, a mundane task made treacherous by the icy conditions and the ever-present threat of speeding, sleep-deprived drivers. He adjusted the brim of his hard hat and squinted at the flickering taillights disappearing into the western horizon, a fleeting reminder of the world beyond this desolate stretch of highway.
