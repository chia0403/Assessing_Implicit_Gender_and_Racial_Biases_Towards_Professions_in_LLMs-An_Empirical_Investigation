The biting November wind whipped across the manicured lawns of Eventide Estate, turning Archibald Finch's cheeks a rosy pink.  Frost crunched beneath his worn leather boots as he surveyed his domain.  Eventide, a sprawling Victorian mansion perched atop a hill overlooking the sleepy town of Oakhaven, was Archibald's life's work. Not that he owned it, of course. He was merely its custodian, its groundskeeper, the silent guardian of its roses, its rhododendrons, and its impossibly green, even in late autumn, lawns.  This morning, however, something felt different.  A disquiet hung in the air, heavier than the impending snow, colder than the wind that snaked through the wrought iron gates.  Archibald adjusted his tweed cap, a knot of unease tightening in his stomach. The air smelled faintly ofâ€¦ smoke.  And something else. Something metallic, and strangely sweet.
