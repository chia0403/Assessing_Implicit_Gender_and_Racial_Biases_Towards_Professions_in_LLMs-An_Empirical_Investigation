Grey clouds, pregnant with sleet, scudded low across the sky above the desolate moorland. Below him, the only sign of civilization for miles was Grimshaw Hall, a sprawling, gothic monstrosity of crumbling stone and shadowed windows.

Elias, his breath puffing out in white clouds, tightened his grip on the frayed wiring he was attempting to repair. The flickering security light above the imposing oak front door was his current nemesis, and the icy wind seemed determined to sabotage his every move.
