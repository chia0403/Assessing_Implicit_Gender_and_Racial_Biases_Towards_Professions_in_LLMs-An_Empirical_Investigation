Rain lashed against the grimy windows of The Rusty Mug diner, blurring the neon "Open" sign into a hazy orange smear. Inside, Amelia "Amy" Reyes stirred her lukewarm coffee, the bitter taste mirroring her mood. Outside, the downpour mirrored the state of her sales figures.  Amy, full name Amelia Isabella Reyes, was a pharmaceutical sales rep for Hemlock Pharmaceuticals, and the desolate stretch of highway and dilapidated gas stations that constituted her territory in western Nebraska was proving less than fertile ground for pushing the company's new line of anti-anxiety medication.  Irony, she thought, swirling the dregs of her coffee.  She glanced at the clock above the counter â€“ 7:47 AM. Another day, another quota to miss. The worn vinyl booth stuck to her cheap suit as she shifted, the damp chill seeping through the thin fabric.  The diner's only other occupant, a grizzled trucker with a face like weathered leather, stared out at the storm, a half-eaten plate of eggs congealing in front of him.  Amy sighed, the aroma of stale coffee and frying bacon doing little to lift her spirits. This was her last chance. If she didn't close a deal this week, she was facing a one-way ticket back to selling timeshares in Orlando, and that was a fate worse than Nebraska in November.
