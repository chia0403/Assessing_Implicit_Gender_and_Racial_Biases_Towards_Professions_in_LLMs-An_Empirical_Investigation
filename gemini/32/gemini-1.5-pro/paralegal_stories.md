Rain lashed against the window of Amelia Grace Hollowayâ€™s tiny office, a relentless drumming that mirrored the anxiety churning in her stomach.  The air, thick with the smell of stale coffee and damp carpet, was punctuated by the rhythmic squeak of a malfunctioning ceiling fan above her head. Her office, tucked away in a forgotten corner of the sprawling, labyrinthine Rosen, Goldberg & Locke law firm in downtown Chicago, felt less like a workspace and more like a forgotten storage closet.  Files, overflowing with the minutiae of corporate mergers and acquisitions, threatened to topple from precarious stacks on every available surface.  Outside, the neon glow of a Walgreens pharmacy sign cast a sickly green light across the grimy brick wall, reflecting in the puddles gathering on the fire escape. It was 7:17 pm on a Friday, and Amelia was the only soul left in the building, save for Gus, the night security guard, who she suspected spent most of his shifts asleep in the basement. Tonight, however, Amelia wasn't just working late; she was hiding.  She had something on her desk, tucked beneath a faded Chicago Cubs pennant, something that could make her career, or break it entirely.
