The biting November wind whipped around Esmeralda "Esme" Reyes, plastering strands of her fiery red hair across her chapped lips.  She tugged her threadbare scarf tighter, the damp wool scratching against her chin.  Above her, the marquee of the dilapidated Grand Majestic Theatre creaked ominously, its once-gilded lettering now flaking like dried paint.  Located on a forgotten block of Chicago’s South Side, the Grand Majestic had seen better days – much better days.  In its heyday, it had hosted vaudeville legends, Broadway tours, and even a fledgling Charlie Chaplin. Now, it was Esme’s kingdom, a crumbling testament to her unwavering belief in the transformative power of theatre, even if her current production was a far cry from the grandeur the Majestic had once known. Tonight was opening night for a community theatre production of  "A Midsummer Night's Dream," and Esme, its passionate and perpetually exhausted director, felt the weight of the world, or at least the weight of a thousand tiny fairy wings, resting squarely on her shoulders.
