The rusty tang of drying blood mingled with the scent of tar and asphalt clinging to Elias Thorne’s calloused hands. He perched precariously on the edge of Mrs. Gable’s gabled roof, a shingle hammer resting beside him like a loyal, if inanimate, companion. Below him, the sleepy town of Harmony Ridge, Pennsylvania, stretched out like a patchwork quilt of green lawns and grey slate roofs, oblivious to the drama that had just unfolded three stories above.  The late September sun, a bruised orange orb dipping towards the horizon, cast long, distorted shadows across the valley, making the familiar streets seem strangely sinister. Elias wasn't looking at the view, however.  His gaze was fixed on the crumpled form lying on the newly shingled section of the roof, a dark stain blooming slowly across the man's checkered shirt.  It had started as a normal Tuesday – a leaky roof, a slightly overbearing client, the usual.  Now, it was anything but.
