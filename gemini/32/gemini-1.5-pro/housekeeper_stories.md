The biting November wind whipped around Agnes Prunella Hawthorne's ankles as she trudged up the long, gravel driveway of Eventide Manor. Dead leaves, the colour of rust and decay, swirled around her sensible brown shoes like tiny, frantic dancers. Eventide, a sprawling Victorian edifice of grey stone and darkened windows, perched on a hill overlooking the churning grey expanse of the North Sea.  It loomed before her, a gothic behemoth against the bruised, twilight sky. The only sign of life was a single, flickering gas lamp in a third-story window, casting a ghostly, elongated shadow that stretched across the manicured, but now frost-covered, lawn. Agnes clutched her worn carpetbag tighter, a shiver that had nothing to do with the cold running down her spine. She had answered the advertisement for a live-in housekeeper at Eventide with a mixture of desperation and trepidation, and now, standing on the doorstep of this isolated mansion, she couldn't shake the feeling that she'd made a terrible mistake.
