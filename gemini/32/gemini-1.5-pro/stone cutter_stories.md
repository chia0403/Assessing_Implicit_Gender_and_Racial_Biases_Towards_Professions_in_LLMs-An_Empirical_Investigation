The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of Eldoria, carrying with it the fine grit of volcanic sand that stung Elias Thorne's exposed skin. Above, a bruised, lavender sky promised more snow before nightfall.  Elias, his calloused hands tucked deep within the pockets of his worn leather jerkin, surveyed the cliff face.  Streaks of obsidian and basalt ran through the pale grey rock, like the veins of some ancient, petrified beast.  This was the Quarry of Whispers, a place shunned by most of the Eldorian folk, who claimed the winds carried the lamentations of the stone itself. Elias, however, found a strange solace in the quarry's isolation. For him, the whispers were not of sorrow, but of potential – the potential held within each unforgiving block of stone, waiting to be unearthed by his hammer and chisel. He had come to this desolate place seeking a particular shade of moonstone, a ghostly white flecked with blue, whispered to exist only in this haunted quarry, for a commission unlike any he’d undertaken before.
