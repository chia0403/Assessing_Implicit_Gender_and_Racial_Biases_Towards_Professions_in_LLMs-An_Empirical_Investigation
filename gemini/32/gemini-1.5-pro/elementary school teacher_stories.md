The late afternoon sun, a buttery yellow orb sinking towards the jagged peaks of the San Gabriel Mountains, cast long shadows across the asphalt playground of Maplewood Elementary.  Amelia Rose Hawthorne, her auburn hair escaping its usually meticulous bun, knelt beside a small boy with tear-streaked cheeks and a scraped knee. The air, still warm from the California sun, smelled of dried leaves and the faint, sugary ghost of lunchtime popsicles.  A symphony of childish shrieks and laughter echoed around them, a counterpoint to the gentle murmur of Amelia's voice as she soothed the boy, applying a brightly coloured band-aid to his injury.  Maplewood, nestled in the sleepy, sun-drenched town of Oakhaven, was a world away from the bustling city life Amelia had once known, but in the three years she'd been teaching there, it had become her sanctuary, a place where magic, both big and small, seemed to happen every day.  This particular afternoon, however, held a different kind of magic, a darker, unsettling kind, that was just beginning to prickle at the edges of Ameliaâ€™s awareness.
