The bell above the door to "Petal & Stem" tinkled merrily, a counterpoint to the drumming rain outside.  Rain lashed against the large storefront window, blurring the vibrant colours of the tulips and daffodils displayed within.  Inside, Eloise Wren Hawthorne, her hands stained green from re-potting ferns, hummed along to a Billie Holiday record playing softly on the vintage turntable perched precariously on a stack of gardening books.  The air hung thick with the scent of damp earth, lilies, and the subtle sweetness of Eloise's signature lavender hand cream. Petal & Stem, nestled between a bustling Italian deli and a dusty antique shop on the cobbled streets of Oakhaven, was her sanctuary, a vibrant splash of colour in a town otherwise muted by the perpetual drizzle of the Pacific Northwest.
