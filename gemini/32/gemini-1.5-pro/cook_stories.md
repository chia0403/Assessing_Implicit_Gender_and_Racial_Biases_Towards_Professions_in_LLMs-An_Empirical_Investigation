The clatter of pots and pans was a familiar lullaby to Elias Thorne.  His kitchen, tucked away in the back corner of The Salty Siren, a ramshackle seaside tavern clinging to the cliffs of Aisling Cove, was his sanctuary.  Salt spray from the crashing waves below often kissed the small, grimy windowpanes, adding a unique seasoning to the air already thick with the aroma of simmering chowder and baking bread.  Aisling Cove itself was a forgotten speck on the map, a collection of weathered houses huddled against the relentless wind, its inhabitants a hardy bunch of fishermen, smugglers, and those who simply preferred to be forgotten by the world. The sky, a bruised purple and streaked with angry orange, hinted at an approaching storm â€“ a common occurrence in these parts.  Elias, a sturdy man with hands calloused from years of kneading dough and wielding a cleaver, wiped a stray bead of sweat from his brow and surveyed his domain.  Tonight's special was a hearty fisherman's stew, a recipe passed down through generations of Thornes, and the rich, savory scent was already drawing the Cove's denizens towards the tavern's warmth and the promise of a full belly.
