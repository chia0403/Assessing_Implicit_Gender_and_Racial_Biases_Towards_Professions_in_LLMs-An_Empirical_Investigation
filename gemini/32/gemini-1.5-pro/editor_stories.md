Rain lashed against the arched window of Amelia Thorne's attic office, each drop a staccato note against the backdrop of a rumbling thunderstorm.  Loose papers danced on her desk, stirred by the draft that snaked its way through the ill-fitting pane.  Outside, the gothic spires of St. Jude's pierced the bruised twilight sky, their silhouettes jagged against the flickering gas lamps of Victorian London.  Amelia, her auburn hair pulled back in a severe bun, chewed the end of her quill pen, her gaze fixed not on the tempest outside, but on the manuscript spread before her.  "The Curious Case of the Clockwork Cadaver," the title page proclaimed in bold, looping script. It was the latest offering from her most eccentric, and most popular, author, and it promised to be either a masterpiece or a magnificent disaster.  The air in the small, book-lined room smelled of old paper, printer's ink, and the faintest hint of ozone. A single flickering gas lamp cast long, dancing shadows that seemed to animate the dusty tomes lining the shelves, turning them into silent, watchful observers of Amelia's nocturnal struggles.
