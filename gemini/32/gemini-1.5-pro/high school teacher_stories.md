The biting November wind whipped around Amelia Hayes’ ankles as she hurried across the parking lot of Northwood High.  Dead leaves, brittle and brown, skittered across the asphalt like nervous insects.  The sky, the color of a bruised plum, promised snow before nightfall.

The fluorescent lights of the school building buzzed, a stark contrast to the deepening twilight outside. Northwood was a sprawling, single-story brick structure, typical of many suburban high schools, but to Amelia, it felt more like a fortress – a refuge from the complexities of the world, and sometimes, a prison of routine.  Today, however, a strange tension hung in the air, a palpable unease that had nothing to do with the impending snowstorm.
