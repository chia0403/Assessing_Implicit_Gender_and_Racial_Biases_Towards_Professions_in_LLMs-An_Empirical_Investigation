The perpetually overcast sky above the small town of Hollow Creek seemed to press down on the Agnes Hazelwood Memorial Library like a damp grey blanket.  Ivy, thick and ancient, clawed its way up the library's brick walls, obscuring the stained-glass windows depicting scenes from classic literature.  Inside, dust motes danced in the slivers of light that managed to pierce through the leafy siege, illuminating rows upon rows of towering bookshelves.  Eleanor Vance Holloway, the town librarian, sat perched on a rolling ladder, her spectacles perched precariously on the bridge of her nose,  re-shelving a first edition copy of "Wuthering Heights."  The scent of old paper and beeswax polish hung heavy in the air, punctuated by the faint, rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner.  It was a Tuesday afternoon, the quietest day of the week, and Eleanor relished the solitude.  Little did she know, the tranquility of Hollow Creek, and her own peaceful existence, were about to be irrevocably shattered.
