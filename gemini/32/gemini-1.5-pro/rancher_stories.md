The wind, a constant companion in this part of the world, whipped at Amelia Grace Holloway's weathered face as she surveyed the parched landscape. Dust devils danced across the cracked earth of the Holloway Ranch, swirling red dirt into the already hazy afternoon sky.  The sun, a malevolent eye in the heavens, beat down on the desiccated fields that stretched as far as the eye could see, broken only by the jagged silhouettes of the Sangre de Cristo mountains in the distance.  New Mexico in July was unforgiving, even more so this year.  The promised monsoon rains hadn't arrived, and the usually vibrant green pastures were now the color of rusting iron. Amelia, her calloused hands gripping the worn wooden rails of the corral fence, felt a knot of worry tighten in her stomach.  This drought, if it continued much longer, threatened not just her livelihood but generations of Holloway history.
