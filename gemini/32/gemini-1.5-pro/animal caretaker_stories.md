The biting wind whipped Amelia "Mia" Rodriguez's auburn braid across her face as she trudged across the frozen expanse of the Wolf Run Wildlife Sanctuary.  Dawn painted the snow-dusted pines a soft lavender, the only sound the crunch of her boots and the distant, mournful howl of Kanti, the sanctuary's alpha female timber wolf. Mia pulled her thick fleece tighter around her, the icy air nipping at any exposed skin. Wolf Run, nestled deep in the Adirondack Mountains of upstate New York, was a haven for injured and orphaned wildlife, a place where broken wings mended and abandoned cubs found solace.  It was Mia's sanctuary too, a place where she found purpose and connection amidst the wild beauty and the silent understanding of the animals in her care.  This morning, however, a strange unease prickled beneath her skin, a feeling as sharp and cold as the wind itself.  Something feltâ€¦different.
