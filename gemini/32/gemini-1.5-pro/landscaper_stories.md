The biting November wind whipped at Amelia “Milly” Reyes’s cheeks, turning them the same shade as the crimson leaves skittering across Mrs. Hawthorne’s meticulously manicured lawn.  Milly tugged her beanie further down, the wool scratching against her forehead.  Ironwood, Connecticut, was picturesque, nestled as it was in the foothills of the Berkshires, but come late autumn, picturesque translated to bone-chillingly cold.  Milly surveyed her work: the Hawthorne property, her largest and most prestigious client, was ready for winter.  The hydrangeas were pruned back, the perennials bundled in burlap, and the last of the fallen leaves gathered into neat piles awaiting the town’s composting pickup.  A thin layer of frost already dusted the pumpkins flanking the front door, a vibrant orange against the slate-grey of the house.  From the distance, the rhythmic whir of a leaf blower signaled that her assistant, Marco, was finishing up on the far side of the property.  Milly breathed out, a puff of white against the grey sky, satisfied.  Winter was coming, but her business, “Earth and Bloom,” was thriving, and for that, at least, she felt a warmth that no amount of New England chill could extinguish.
