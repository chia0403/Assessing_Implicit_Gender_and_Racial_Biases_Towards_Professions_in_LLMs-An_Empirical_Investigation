The flickering neon sign of the "Lucky Horseshoe Diner" cast a sickly green glow over Elias Thorne's Ford Fairlane, parked haphazardly on the cracked asphalt.  Rain, the relentless kind that seeped into your bones and soured your mood, lashed against the windshield, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Elias.  He hated Mondays. Hated Bakersfield.  Hated, most of all, driving two hours out to this godforsaken stretch of highway to assess the damage to a rusted-out combine harvester, supposedly struck by lightning.  Elias Thorne, insurance agent for the perpetually understaffed and perpetually overwhelmed Allstate Mutual of Central California, sighed, pulled his worn fedora lower over his eyes, and grabbed his battered briefcase. The air hung thick with the smell of wet earth and diesel, and the distant rumble of thunder promised the rain wasn't going anywhere soon.  This was going to be a long night.
