The rusty squeak of the screen door announced another sweltering Georgia afternoon. Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight slicing through the gloom of Floyd’s Barber Shop, illuminating the worn leather of the barber chairs and the faded posters of pompadoured rockabilly stars clinging to the wood-paneled walls.  Elias Walker Finch, his own salt-and-pepper hair slicked back in a style reminiscent of a bygone era, sighed and wiped his brow with a checkered handkerchief.  The small town of Harmony Creek, Georgia, was stuck in a perpetual summer slumber, and business, like the air, was thick and slow. Outside, cicadas droned their relentless chorus, a soundtrack to the stillness. Inside, the only other sound was the rhythmic snip-snip of Elias’s scissors as he meticulously trimmed the overgrown hedges of a plastic fern, the only plant hardy enough to survive the combined neglect and affection of his clientele.  He glanced at the dusty clock ticking above the cash register. 2:17 PM.  Another hour, maybe two, before anyone else dared brave the heat for a trim.
