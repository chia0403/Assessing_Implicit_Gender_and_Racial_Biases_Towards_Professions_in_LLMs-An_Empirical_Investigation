The rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Amelia Thorne’s forty-second-floor office, blurring the already fading London skyline into a hazy wash of grey.  Each drop seemed to echo the knot of tension tightening in her stomach. Amelia Thorne, Chief Operating Officer of Thorne Dynamics, a global leader in sustainable energy solutions, tapped a manicured nail against the polished mahogany of her desk.  The rhythmic tapping was the only sound in the otherwise silent office, save for the relentless drumming of the storm. Scattered across the desk were meticulously organized files pertaining to Project Chimera, Thorne Dynamics’ most ambitious – and potentially most perilous – undertaking yet.  A single, stark white orchid, its delicate petals trembling in the draft from the faulty air conditioning vent, sat in a silver pot, a stark contrast to the otherwise sterile environment.  The air, thick with the scent of impending crisis, crackled with an unspoken energy, a premonition of the storm brewing not just outside, but within the very heart of Thorne Dynamics.
