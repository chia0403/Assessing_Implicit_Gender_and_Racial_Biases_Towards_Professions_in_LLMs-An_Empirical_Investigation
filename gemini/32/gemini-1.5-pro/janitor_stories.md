The flickering fluorescent lights of the Zenith BioTech research wing buzzed like trapped insects, casting a sickly yellow glow over Elias Thorne. Elias, his name tag pinned slightly askew on his faded blue Zenith uniform, pushed his mop bucket across the polished concrete floor, the squeaky wheels a counterpoint to the hum. It was 3:17 AM, the quietest hour in the sprawling complex nestled in the redwood forests overlooking the Pacific. Outside, the fog hung heavy, muting the rhythmic crash of waves against the cliffs below. Inside, the air thrummed with a low, almost imperceptible vibration, a secret hum Elias had grown accustomed to over his five years cleaning the labs. Tonight, however, the hum feltâ€¦ different. Sharper. More urgent.  And it seemed to be emanating from Dr. Albright's lab, a place usually locked tighter than a drum at this hour.
