Rain lashed against the window of Amelia Rose Hawthorne's cramped office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  Tax season, that annual descent into organized chaos, had arrived in full, dreary force. Her office, nestled above a laundromat in the perpetually damp town of Port Blossom, Oregon, was awash in the scent of stale coffee and desperation. Stacks of W-2s, 1099s, and crumpled receipts threatened to engulf Amelia like a paper tsunami.  Outside, the neon glow of the "Suds & Duds" sign cast a sickly green light onto the rain-slicked street, offering little cheer to the beleaguered taxpayers who trudged towards her door, clutching their shoeboxes full of financial hope and dread. Amelia sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear.  This was going to be a long one.
