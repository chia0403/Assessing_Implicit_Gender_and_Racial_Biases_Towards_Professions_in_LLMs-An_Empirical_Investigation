The biting Alaskan wind whipped at Amelia "Amy" Reyes's parka as she prepped her Cessna 206 for takeoff. The tiny Denali National Park airstrip, a mere ribbon of gravel carved into the tundra, offered little protection from the elements.  Towering snow-capped peaks, bathed in the ethereal glow of pre-dawn, loomed like silent giants around her.  Amy’s breath plumed white in the frigid air as she checked the fuel lines, her gloved hands clumsy with cold.  This was her third supply run to the remote research outpost nestled deep within the park – a routine flight, she kept telling herself, despite the knot of unease tightening in her stomach.  The weather forecast had called for clear skies, but the wind’s insistent howl and the ominous steel-grey clouds gathering over Mount McKinley hinted at a different story. This morning, the wilderness felt particularly vast, particularly unforgiving.
