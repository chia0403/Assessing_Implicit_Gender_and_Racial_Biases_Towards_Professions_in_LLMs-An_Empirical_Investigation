The salt spray kissed Amelia Zephyr Thorne's face as she leaned against the weathered railing of her balcony, the rhythmic crash of waves against the rocky Cornish coast a familiar lullaby. Her cottage, perched precariously on the cliff edge, offered a breathtaking view of the turbulent Atlantic, a view that had both inspired and haunted her for the past five years.  "Stormwatch Cottage," as she'd christened it, had been meant as a sanctuary, a place where she could escape the clamor of London literary circles and finally finish her second novel.  Instead, it had become a prison of writer's block, each empty page a stark reminder of her dwindling confidence and the crushing weight of expectation that followed her surprise bestseller debut.  The wind whipped through the overgrown ivy that clung to the stone walls, mirroring the turmoil in Amelia's heart.  The sky, a bruised purple and ominous grey, threatened a storm, much like the one brewing within her own creative spirit.
