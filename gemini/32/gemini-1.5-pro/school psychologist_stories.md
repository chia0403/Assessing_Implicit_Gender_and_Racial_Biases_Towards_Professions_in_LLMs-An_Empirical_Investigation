The crisp October air, scented with woodsmoke and decaying leaves, nipped at Dr. Elias Thorne’s exposed ears as he hurried across the courtyard of Hemlock Falls High School.  Grey granite buildings, gothic in their stoicism, loomed around him, their windows reflecting a bruised, pre-dusk sky.  Elias tugged his tweed jacket tighter, the worn fabric offering little resistance against the encroaching chill.  He was late. Again. Mrs. Peterson, the exasperated school secretary, had specifically requested his presence at 3:15 sharp to discuss the escalating behavioral issues of a certain Jason Crowley, a student whose file was thicker than Elias’s winter coat.  He glanced at the ornate clock tower, its hands mockingly pointing to 3:22. Jason Crowley was just one piece of the puzzle that was Hemlock Falls High – a puzzle Elias was increasingly convinced he lacked the pieces to solve.  The town itself, nestled deep in the Appalachian Mountains, seemed to exude a quiet unease, a palpable tension that seeped into the very foundations of the school, affecting students and staff alike.  And Elias, in his first year as the school psychologist, was caught right in the middle of it.
