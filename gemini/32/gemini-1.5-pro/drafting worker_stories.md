The flickering fluorescent lights of the D&M Architectural firm buzzed like trapped insects, a soundtrack to Amelia Reyes's Tuesday morning.  Amelia, whose full name was Amelia Isabella Reyes, hunched over her drafting table, the cool metal a welcome contrast to the rising summer heat radiating through the large, dusty windows.  Outside, the clamor of downtown San Francisco – car horns, distant sirens, the rumble of cable cars – was muted, swallowed by the thick glass and the even thicker layers of blueprints piled around her workspace.  The office, a converted warehouse in the South of Market district, was a labyrinth of identical metal tables, each occupied by a drafter bent low over their work, illuminated by the same pale, unforgiving light.  The air smelled faintly of pencil shavings, printer ink, and the stale coffee perpetually brewing in the breakroom.  Today, however, a new scent mingled with the familiar – the sharp, metallic tang of anxiety, emanating from Amelia herself.  This morning's meeting with Mr. Henderson, the notoriously demanding senior partner, loomed over her like a skyscraper about to topple.
