The insistent California sun, already a force at 7:00 am, streamed through the gap in Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s floral curtains, illuminating dust motes dancing in the otherwise sterile air.  Amelia, a Registered Dietitian with a penchant for order and a mild obsession with chia seeds, blinked awake, the faint scent of eucalyptus from her neighbour’s tree drifting in through the open window.

From her vantage point, the city resembled a glittering, concrete tapestry, woven with threads of shimmering freeways and punctuated by the emerald green of stubbornly persistent palm trees.  This morning, however, Amelia wasn’t admiring the view. She was fixated on a single, rogue crumb clinging stubbornly to her pristine white duvet cover.  It appeared to be a remnant of last night's clandestine indulgence – a single, forbidden square of dark chocolate.  The crumb, in its flagrant defiance of her meticulously planned dietary regime, was a jarring start to what promised to be a particularly unusual day.
