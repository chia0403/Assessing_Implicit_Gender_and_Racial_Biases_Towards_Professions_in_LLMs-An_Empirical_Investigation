The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of The Rusty Mug, a rhythm Elias Finch had come to find strangely comforting.  Nestled in the heart of Port Blossom, a once-thriving fishing town now clinging to the edge of Maine's rocky coast, the bar was Eliasâ€™s domain.  Salt air, tinged with the faint aroma of frying fish from the chippy next door, perpetually hung in the air, mingling with the sweeter notes of whiskey and stale beer inside. The interior, dimly lit by flickering neon signs and a single, stubborn overhead bulb, was a tapestry of worn leather booths, scarred wooden tables, and a long, mahogany bar polished smooth by years of elbows and spilled drinks.  Tonight, however, the usual Friday night buzz was absent. Only a handful of regulars hunched over their drinks, their faces reflecting the melancholic glow of the jukebox, mirroring the grey, churning sea outside.  Elias, a man built like a sea captain with weathered hands and eyes the color of a stormy ocean, wiped down the bar with a practiced hand, a pensive frown etched on his face.  He knew Port Blossom was fading, and with it, a piece of him.
