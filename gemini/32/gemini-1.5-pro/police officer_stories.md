The biting wind whipped Amelia “Mia” Diaz’s dark hair across her face as she surveyed the scene.  Frozen sleet crunched under her heavy boots, the sound swallowed by the vastness of the abandoned shipyard.  Towering cranes loomed like skeletal giants against the bruised twilight sky, their rusted hooks swaying gently in the wind, a mournful creak accompanying each swing.  The air, thick with the tang of salt and decaying metal, hung heavy in Mia’s lungs.  The flickering sodium lights of the Baltimore PD patrol car cast long, distorted shadows that danced across the corrugated steel walls of the warehouses, making the already desolate space feel even more sinister.  Tonight's call – a suspected break-in – was shaping up to be anything but routine.
