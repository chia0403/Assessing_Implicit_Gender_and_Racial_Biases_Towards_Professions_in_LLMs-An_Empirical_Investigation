The flickering fluorescent lights of the Grand Majestic Hotel lobby buzzed like trapped wasps.  Amelia Rose Hawthorne, perched behind the swirling walnut reception desk, tapped a chipped crimson nail against the worn leather blotter. Outside, the Detroit wind howled a mournful tune, whipping snow against the grand arched windows that showcased a bleak, grey January afternoon. The lobby, usually bustling with businessmen and wide-eyed tourists, was eerily quiet. Only the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner and the occasional muffled cough from Mr. Henderson, the resident pigeon whoâ€™d taken up roost in the rafters, disturbed the silence. Amelia, dressed in her crisp navy uniform and a forced smile, felt a prickle of unease. This kind of quiet never boded well.
