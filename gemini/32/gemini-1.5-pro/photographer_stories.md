The salt spray stung Cassandra “Cassie” Moreau’s face as she leaned precariously over the railing of the ferry, her Canon EOS R5 gripped tight in her calloused hands. The Isle of Skye, a jagged silhouette against the bruised purple of the pre-dawn sky, loomed closer with each churn of the propeller.  The air, thick with the promise of rain and the tang of seaweed, whipped Cassie’s dark, wind-blown hair across her face, momentarily obscuring her view of the island’s dramatic cliffs and hidden coves. This wasn't a holiday. This was a pilgrimage.  Cassie had come to Skye, drawn by the whispers of its untamed beauty and the haunting legends of the selkies, mythical creatures said to shed their seal skin and walk among humans.  She planned to capture the essence of the island, the raw, elemental power that pulsed beneath its heather-covered hills, and maybe, just maybe, glimpse something more.
