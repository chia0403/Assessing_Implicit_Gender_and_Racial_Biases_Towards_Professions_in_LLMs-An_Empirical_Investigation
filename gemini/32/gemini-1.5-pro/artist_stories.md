The salt spray stung Eliza Jane Holloway's face as she perched precariously on the jagged rocks overlooking Port Blossom's churning harbor.  Her easel, weighted down with stones, battled the insistent wind, its canvas flapping like a startled bird.  Below, the fishing boats bobbed and clanged, their brightly painted hulls a stark contrast to the steely grey of the November sky. Port Blossom, nestled on the craggy coast of Maine, was a town draped in the melancholy beauty of late autumn.  The tourist season had long since ebbed, leaving behind a quiet solitude that Eliza cherished.  This was when the true colors of the town emerged, the vibrant hues of summer replaced by a muted palette of greys, blues, and the deep ochre of the decaying seaweed clinging to the rocks. It was this melancholic beauty Eliza sought to capture, her fingers already stained with the charcoal she used to sketch the dramatic scene unfolding before her.
