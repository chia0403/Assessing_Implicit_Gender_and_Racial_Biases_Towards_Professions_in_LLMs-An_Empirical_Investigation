The clatter of the El train vibrated through the floorboards of Seraphina Iris Thorne's small apartment, a rhythmic counterpoint to the whir of her Singer sewing machine.  It was a sweltering July in 1923, and the air in Chicago hung thick and heavy, even with the single window propped open, its screen buzzing with trapped flies.  Seraphinaâ€™s workshop, carved out of the corner of her living room in a modest walk-up in Lincoln Park, was a kaleidoscope of fabrics. Bolts of emerald green velvet, crimson silk, and butter-yellow chiffon were stacked precariously on shelves, spilling onto chairs and even the small icebox that hummed faintly in the corner.  A half-finished flapper dress, shimmering with silver beads, lay draped across a dress form, waiting for Seraphina's deft touch to bring it to life. Outside, the city throbbed with the pulse of jazz and the promise of a long, hot night, but in Seraphina's little sanctuary, the only music was the steady hum of creation.
