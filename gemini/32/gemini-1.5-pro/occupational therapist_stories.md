Gargoyles perched on the gothic building's rain-slicked ledges, their stony grimaces mirroring the grey, churning sky above.

The wrought iron gates, usually open wide, were chained shut this morning, adding to the unsettling feeling that clung to the air like the damp.  Amelia, clutching her thermos of strong coffee in one hand and a battered leather satchel overflowing with patient files in the other, frowned.  This was unlike St. Jude's; usually, even in the face of inclement weather, the gates remained open, a symbolic gesture of welcome to those seeking refuge within its walls. Today, something felt different.  Almostâ€¦sinister.
