The biting wind whipped off the Obsidian Sea, stinging Elias Thorne's cheeks and rattling the iron links of the Watchtower gate.  Jagged black peaks clawed at the bruised twilight sky, mirroring the serrated edges of the obsidian cliffs below.  Elias, bundled in thick furs despite the persistent summer chill of the Northern Reaches, stamped his feet against the stone floor, trying to ward off the numbness creeping into his toes.  He was three hours into his four-hour shift guarding the Stormwatch Citadel, the lone outpost between the civilized lands of Aeridor and the desolate, whisper-filled wastelands known as the Whispering Barrens.  The Citadel, a grim fortress of dark stone and iron, clung precariously to the edge of the cliff, its foundations seemingly fused to the very rock itself. Tonight, the only sound besides the howling wind was the rhythmic clang of the lighthouse beacon, a lonely pulse of light against the encroaching darkness.  Something about the stillness, a stillness deeper than usual, made the hairs on the back of Elias's neck prickle.
