The biting November wind whipped at Amelia "Mia" Rodriguez's turnout coat as she stood on the icy rooftop, the Chicago skyline a jagged, glittering silhouette against the bruised twilight sky. Flakes of lake-effect snow, fat and lazy, danced in the beams of the emergency spotlights that illuminated the three-story brownstone below.  Smoke, thick and acrid, billowed from the shattered windows of the second floor, occasionally punctuated by bursts of orange flame. The roar of the fire engines and the shouts of her fellow firefighters from Engine Company 17 formed a chaotic symphony against the backdrop of the city's usual hum. Mia, her dark hair plastered to her forehead with a mixture of sweat and melting snow, adjusted her oxygen mask and gripped her axe tighter, the cold steel a reassuring weight in her gloved hand. The fire was spreading fast, and the information relayed over the radio – possible trapped occupants on the third floor – made a chill run down her spine that had nothing to do with the temperature.
