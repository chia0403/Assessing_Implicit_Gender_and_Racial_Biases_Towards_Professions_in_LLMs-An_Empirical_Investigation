The fluorescent lights of St. Jude's Medical Center hummed a monotonous tune, reflecting off the polished linoleum floors.  Rain hammered against the tall windows of the outpatient lab, blurring the already grey November sky into a featureless wash. Inside, the air crackled with the low murmur of anxious patients and the rhythmic squeak of rolling chairs.  Eleanor Vance, a phlebotomist with ten years of experience and a remarkable ability to find even the most elusive veins, adjusted the tourniquet on a nervous teenager's arm.  The boy's eyes, wide and fixed on the approaching needle, reminded Eleanor of a startled fawn.  She gave him a reassuring smile, a small, genuine curve of her lips that, over the years, had calmed countless jittery patients.  "All right, sweetheart," she murmured, her voice soft but steady. "Nice, deep breath for me."  But even as she spoke, a strange, metallic tang filled the air, and the lights flickered ominously, plunging the lab into a brief, unsettling darkness.
