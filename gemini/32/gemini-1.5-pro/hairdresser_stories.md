The aroma of coconut oil and burnt sugar hung thick in the air, a peculiar but not unpleasant blend unique to Clementine's Curl Up & Dye.  Rain lashed against the large bay window, blurring the neon "Open" sign and the view of the usually bustling Magnolia Street in downtown Havenwood, Oregon. Clementine "Cleo" Bellweather, her fingers stained a vibrant magenta from a recent color treatment, sighed dramatically, watching the rivulets of water race each other down the glass. This Tuesday afternoon was shaping up to be slower than a snail in a molasses factory, and Cleo, despite her outward theatrics, was secretly grateful.  The past week had been a whirlwind of updos, perms, and demanding brides-to-be, leaving her craving a moment of blessed quiet.  She perched on a velvet-upholstered stool behind the counter, a chipped teacup warming her hands, and idly flipped through the pages of a well-worn copy of "1001 Hairstyles for the Discerning Woman." The bell above the door chimed, a discordant jingle in the otherwise peaceful salon, and Cleo braced herself, pasting on a smile. This was Havenwood, after all, and even a downpour couldn't keep the secrets and scandals from swirling.
