Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's chiropractic clinic, mimicking the persistent ache in his own lower back. The "Thorne Chiropractic & Wellness Center" sign, usually a beacon of hopeful neon green, was barely visible through the downpour that had settled over the small town of Havenwood, Oregon.  Inside, the waiting room was empty except for a single wilting fern and the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock Elias had inherited from his grandmother. The scent of pine-infused cleaning spray hung in the air, a stark contrast to the musty petrichor that seeped in whenever the front door opened. Elias, dressed in his usual crisp white shirt and khaki pants, stared out at the deserted Main Street, his fingers drumming a restless tattoo against the polished oak of the reception desk. He’d seen slower Tuesdays in Havenwood, even in the depths of winter, but this felt different. It felt…omenous.
