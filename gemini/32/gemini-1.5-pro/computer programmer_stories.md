The air hung heavy with the scent of burnt coffee and the faint, metallic tang of ozone, a byproduct of the crackling energy emanating from the custom-built server rack humming in the corner.  Elias, clad in his usual uniform of a faded black t-shirt and worn jeans, paced restlessly, his fingers twitching as if itching to return to the keyboard where, just hours ago, he’d stumbled upon something he couldn’t explain. Something that terrified him.
