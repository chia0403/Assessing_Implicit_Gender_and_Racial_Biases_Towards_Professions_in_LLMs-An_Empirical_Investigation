Jed stamped his feet, the crunch of frost-covered earth a sharp counterpoint to the mournful sigh of the wind. Around him, the Blackwood Lumber Camp, a collection of rough-hewn cabins and sheds nestled in a clearing, was slowly stirring to life.  Smoke curled from the chimney of the mess hall, promising the warmth of coffee and the hearty smell of fried bacon. But Jed wasn't thinking of breakfast. His gaze was fixed on the towering Douglas fir that stood sentinel at the edge of the clearing, its trunk thicker than any man could embrace. This was the Old Man, the largest tree on the mountain, and today, Jedediah Blackwood was going to bring it down.
