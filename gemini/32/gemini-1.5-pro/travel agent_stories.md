The relentless Glasgow rain hammered against the window of "Globetrotters' Gateway," blurring the neon pink and lime green lettering of Eliza Jane MacIntyre's travel agency.  Inside, the air smelled faintly of coconut sunscreen and stale coffee, a peculiar blend Eliza had come to associate with dashed dreams and delayed flights.  It was a Tuesday afternoon in late November, the kind of grey, damp day that made even the most vibrant travel brochures look washed-out and unappealing. Eliza, perched on a stool behind her cluttered desk, tapped a chipped mug painted with the Eiffel Tower against her teeth, her gaze fixed on the persistent downpour. The only other occupant of the small, brightly painted office was Bruce, a rubber plant whose wilting leaves mirrored Elizaâ€™s own flagging spirit. This November had been particularly brutal, both for the weather and for business.  People, it seemed, preferred hibernating to holidaying.  Eliza sighed, the sound lost in the drumming of rain and the faint hum of the travel brochures, stacked high and gathering dust on the shelves.  She desperately needed a booking, preferably one involving a sun-drenched beach and a cocktail with a tiny umbrella.
