The relentless Nevada sun beat down on the dusty storefront of Yucca Springs Pharmacy, its faded turquoise paint peeling like sunburnt skin.  Inside, the air conditioning hummed a monotonous tune, battling the oppressive heat.  Dr. Evelyn Reed, PharmD, straightened a stack of prescription pads with a sigh, the silence broken only by the rhythmic whir of the ceiling fan and the distant clinking of wind chimes hanging from the eaves.

Evelyn had envisioned a different kind of life when she graduated top of her class, a life filled with cutting-edge research and complex cases. Instead, she found herself dispensing antihistamines for dust allergies and refilling prescriptions for blood pressure medication, the desert wind whispering tales of forgotten dreams through the cracks in the window frame.  This Tuesday morning, however, felt different. A low rumble, like distant thunder, vibrated through the floor, and the wind chimes stopped their gentle song.
