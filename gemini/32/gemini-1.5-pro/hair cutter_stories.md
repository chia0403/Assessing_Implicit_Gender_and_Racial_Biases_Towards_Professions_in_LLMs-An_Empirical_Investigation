The rusty scissors, cool and familiar in Elias Thorne's hand, snicked rhythmically, punctuating the low hum of conversation in Thorne's Tonsorial Parlour.  The Parlour, nestled between Mrs. O’Malley’s perpetually fragrant bakery and a dusty antique shop in the small, seaside town of Port Blossom, Maine, was a haven from the biting November wind whipping off the Atlantic.  Sunlight, filtered through the large, frosted window facing the harbour, glinted off the brass and chrome of the barber chairs, illuminating the swirling motes of dust dancing in the air. Elias, a man whose face seemed perpetually etched with a gentle smile, carefully sculpted the sideburns of old Mr. Henderson, a man whose stories were as long and tangled as his now-neatly trimmed beard.  The scent of bay rum and talcum powder mingled with the sweet aroma of cinnamon rolls drifting in from next door, creating a uniquely Port Blossom ambiance.  This afternoon, however, the usual calm of the Parlour was about to be shattered.
