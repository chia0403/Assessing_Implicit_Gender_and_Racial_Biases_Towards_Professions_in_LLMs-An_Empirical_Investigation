The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of plumeria and exhaust fumes, as Isabella "Izzy" Cortez adjusted the microphone clipped to her coral linen shirt.  A gecko, emerald green and impossibly still, observed her from a crack in the crumbling ochre wall of the sixteenth-century Spanish fort.  Below, the turquoise waters of Cartagena Bay lapped gently against the sea wall, reflecting the vibrant colours of the Colombian fishing boats bobbing in the harbour. Izzy smiled, a practiced, welcoming curve of her lips that didn't quite reach the weariness in her dark brown eyes.  Twenty-eight sweaty tourists, mostly retirees from Ohio, fanned themselves expectantly beneath the unforgiving midday sun. This was Izzyâ€™s third tour of the Castillo San Felipe de Barajas this week, and while she loved sharing the stories of her city, sometimes, just sometimes, she dreamed of trading her microphone for a hammock and a cool glass of limonada.
