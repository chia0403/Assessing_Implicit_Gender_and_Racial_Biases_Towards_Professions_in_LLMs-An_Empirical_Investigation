The biting wind whipped off the East River, slicing through Dr. Elias Vance’s thin paramedic jacket as he stared up at the skeletal frame of the half-constructed skyscraper.  A single, flickering work light clung precariously to a steel beam thirty stories up, swaying like a frantic firefly against the inky backdrop of a pre-dawn Manhattan sky. Sirens wailed in the distance, their mournful cries echoing off the canyons of glass and steel, growing louder with each passing second. Elias’ breath plumed out in white puffs, momentarily obscuring his view of the chaotic scene below.  Twisted metal, shattered concrete, and a disconcerting stillness hung heavy in the air, punctuated by the frantic shouts of firefighters and the intermittent clang of rescue equipment.  This wasn't just another construction accident; Elias could feel it in the pit of his stomach. This was something…bigger.
