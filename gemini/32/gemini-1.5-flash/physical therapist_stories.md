The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Mia" Hernandez's auburn hair across her face as she hurried down Bleecker Street, the scent of roasting chestnuts and damp asphalt clinging to the chill air.  Greenwich Village, usually a charming kaleidoscope of brownstones and bustling life, felt muted under a blanket of grey skies. Rain threatened, promising to transform the already slick cobblestones into a treacherous skating rink. Mia pulled her worn scarf tighter, the wool scratching against her chapped cheeks.  She was late, again. Not a good look for a physical therapist who prided herself on punctuality, especially when her client was Mr. Fitzgerald, a notoriously grumpy retired judge with a temper as sharp as his walker's wheels.  The flickering neon sign of "Rehab & Restore" cast a pale, uncertain glow on the building ahead, a beacon in the gathering gloom.  Inside, the comforting aroma of antiseptic and brewed coffee promised a brief respite from the relentless November chill.
