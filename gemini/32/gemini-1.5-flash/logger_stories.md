The biting wind howled a mournful tune through the skeletal branches of the ancient Douglas firs, whistling a song only Silas Blackwood understood.  Silas, a man carved from the same stubborn granite as the mountains themselves, hunched deeper into his worn sheepskin coat.  The air, thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, hung heavy in the pre-dawn gloom of the Cascade Range.  He stood at the edge of the Blackwood Timber Claim, a sprawling expanse of old-growth forest that had been in his family for generations, its trees reaching towards the heavens like supplicants pleading for mercy from a capricious god â€“ a god that, Silas knew, had little patience for sentiment.  The axe leaned against a snow-dusted log, its polished head gleaming faintly in the weak light, a silent promise of the hard work to come.  The silence, broken only by the wind and the occasional snap of a twig underfoot, was a deceptive calm; the forest, Silas knew, was a wild thing, capable of both breathtaking beauty and terrifying fury.
