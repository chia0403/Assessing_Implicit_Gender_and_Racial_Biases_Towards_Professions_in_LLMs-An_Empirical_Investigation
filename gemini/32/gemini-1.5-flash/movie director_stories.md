The initial scouting trip, planned as a whirlwind three-day affair, had stretched into a week, and the looming deadline felt like a dark cloud gathering on the horizon, as threatening as the storm clouds currently assembling over the churning ocean.  This remote corner of the world, a place where the whisper of ancient myths still clung to the windswept heather, was proving to be as challenging as it was breathtakingly beautiful.
