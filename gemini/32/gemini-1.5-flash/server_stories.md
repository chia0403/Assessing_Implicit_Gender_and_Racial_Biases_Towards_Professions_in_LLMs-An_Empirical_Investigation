The chipped Formica tabletop vibrated faintly under Amelia Grace Hathaway’s hand as she balanced a tray laden with precarious towers of pancakes, each drowning in a sugary syrup waterfall.  The air in the “Sunrise Diner” hung thick with the scent of frying bacon, burnt coffee, and the faint, almost imperceptible tang of desperation – a smell Amelia had come to know intimately after five years of wiping down sticky counters and enduring the endless stream of grumpy early-morning commuters.  Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a pale, sickly yellow glow on the linoleum floor, reflecting dully off the chrome of the worn-out stools. Outside, the pre-dawn sky bled from bruised purple to a hesitant, watery grey, promising another day of relentless humidity and the relentless grind of the Sunrise Diner.
