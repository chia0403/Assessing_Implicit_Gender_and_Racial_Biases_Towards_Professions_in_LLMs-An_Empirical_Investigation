The scent of coconut and chamomile hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Seraphina “Sera” Moreau.  Rain lashed against the oversized windows of her salon, "Shear Perfection," blurring the neon lights of the city into shimmering streaks of colour.  Inside, however, it was a haven of warm, inviting light.  The plush velvet armchairs, worn soft from years of client chatter and the gentle hum of hair dryers, were arranged around a central island displaying an array of gleaming hair products – bottles like tiny, jewel-toned potions promising miracles.  Sera, with her own fiery red hair pulled back in a practical braid, expertly wielded a pair of shears, her movements precise and fluid as she sculpted a cascade of blonde waves.  The rhythmic snip-snip of the scissors was the soundtrack to her evening, punctuated only by the soft murmur of the television in the corner, broadcasting a cheesy reality show she barely registered.  Tonight, though, the usual calm was broken by a tension that hung thicker than the vanilla-infused hair conditioner.  A new client sat in her chair, a woman whose haunted eyes hinted at a story far more compelling than anything on the television screen.
