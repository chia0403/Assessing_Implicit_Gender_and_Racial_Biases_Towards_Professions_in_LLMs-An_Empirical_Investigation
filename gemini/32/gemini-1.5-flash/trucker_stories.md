The biting Montana wind howled a mournful song around Ezekiel “Zeke” Stone’s rig, a symphony of ice scraping against metal and the distant, lonely wail of a coyote.  Snow, thick and relentless, plastered the windshield of his battered Kenworth, obscuring the already fading light of a late November afternoon.  Zeke, his weathered face etched with the map of a thousand miles and a lifetime spent battling the elements, wrestled the steering wheel, the truck groaning under the strain of the uphill climb towards the Continental Divide.  The only illumination came from the flickering dashboard lights and the occasional, fleeting glare of his headlights, cutting brief, icy swaths through the swirling whiteout.  Ahead, the road, barely visible beneath a thick blanket of snow, stretched onward, an unforgiving ribbon into the heart of a winter’s fury.  His CB radio crackled with static, a fitting accompaniment to the desolate landscape.  This wasn't just a job; it was a fight for survival, a lonely battle waged against the unforgiving power of nature.
