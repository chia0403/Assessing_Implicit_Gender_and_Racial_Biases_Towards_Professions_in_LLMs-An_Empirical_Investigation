The salt spray stung Detective Inspector Amelia Stone's face as the relentless wind howled a mournful dirge across the desolate expanse of Croyde Bay.  November’s grip held the North Devon coastline in an icy embrace, the usually vibrant hues of the cliffs dulled to a palette of grey and bruised purple under a sky the colour of a pewter tankard.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and seaweed, carried the faint, metallic tang of blood.  Amelia, her thick wool coat doing little to ward off the penetrating chill, pulled her collar higher, the collar of her police-issue jacket already frosted with a fine layer of ice.  Ahead, the jagged silhouette of Baggy Point clawed at the stormy sky, a grim sentinel guarding the scene that lay sprawled below – a scene that promised to be far more brutal than the elements themselves.
