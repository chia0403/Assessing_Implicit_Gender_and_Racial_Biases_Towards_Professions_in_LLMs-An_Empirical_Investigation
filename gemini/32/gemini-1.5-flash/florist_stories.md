The scent of lilies, heady and almost cloying, hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the biting November wind rattling the panes of Willow Creek Florist.  Rain lashed against the small shop's windows, blurring the already fading light of a late afternoon.  Inside, amidst a riot of colour that seemed to defy the grey gloom outside, Amelia Rose Hawthorne carefully arranged a cascade of deep crimson roses, her nimble fingers moving with practiced grace.  The bell above the door chimed a discordant jingle, a sharp interruption to the peaceful rhythm of her work.  Amelia, her brow furrowed in concentration, barely registered the sound, her attention wholly consumed by the delicate art of floral design.  The shop, nestled on the edge of a sleepy coastal village, was as much a haven for Amelia as it was a business; a place where the chaos of life outside was muted by the fragrance of blossoms and the quiet rustle of leaves.
