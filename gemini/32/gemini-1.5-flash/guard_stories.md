The biting wind whipped across the obsidian peaks of the Dragon's Tooth mountains, carrying with it the scent of pine and the faint, metallic tang of blood.  A lone raven circled overhead, its shadow a fleeting inky stain against the bruised purple of the twilight sky.  Below, nestled precariously on a narrow shelf of rock barely wider than a man's outstretched arms, stood the Citadel of Silvanus.  Its grey stone walls, scarred by centuries of siege and storm, seemed to claw at the darkening sky.  Within those walls, patrolling the ramparts with the methodical tread of a seasoned veteran, stood Guard Captain Elara Rhys.  The weight of her chainmail, heavy even in the crisp mountain air, felt strangely comforting against the gnawing unease that had settled deep in her bones.  Tonight, something felt different.  The usual quiet hum of the Citadel – the creak of aged wood, the muffled sounds of guardsmen shifting their weight – was replaced by an unsettling silence, broken only by the mournful cry of the wind.
