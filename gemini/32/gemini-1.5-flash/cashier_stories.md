The fluorescent lights of "Quick Stop & Shop" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Grace Hawthorne's life.  Amelia, or Amy as everyone except her grandmother called her, rested her chin on her hand, the cool plastic of the countertop a welcome contrast to the throbbing ache behind her eyes.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the already indistinct view of the deserted highway outside.  The only sounds besides the hum were the rhythmic *click-whirr* of the ancient scanner and the occasional spatter of rain against the glass.  Inside, the air hung thick with the cloying sweetness of stale donuts and the faint, metallic tang of spilled soda, a familiar perfume that clung to everything in the cramped convenience store. Tonight, however, the usual quiet ennui was punctuated by a low, almost imperceptible tremor that ran through the floorboards.  Amy, attuned to the rhythms of the Quick Stop as she was to the beat of her own weary heart, knew that something was different.  Something was coming.
