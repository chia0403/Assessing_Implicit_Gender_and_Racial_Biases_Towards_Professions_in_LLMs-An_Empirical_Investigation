The scent of burnt sugar and rosemary hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume only Amelia Grace Hawthorne truly appreciated.  Amelia, owner and sole stylist at "Shear Genius," a salon tucked away on a cobbled side street in the ancient, fairytale-esque town of Oakhaven, sighed, the sound lost in the rhythmic whir of her vintage hair dryer. Rain lashed against the leaded glass windows of her tiny shop, blurring the already hazy gaslight glow of the street outside.  Oakhaven, despite its charming facade, held a secret dampness, a chill that seeped into the very bones, especially on nights like this. Tonight, that chill felt particularly menacing, a premonition prickling at the back of Amelia's neck, even more unsettling than the usual autumnal gloom.
