The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Mia” Hawthorne’s auburn hair across her face as she hurried down Elm Street, the collar of her tweed coat pulled high.  The scent of woodsmoke and roasting chestnuts battled with the metallic tang of exhaust fumes, a peculiar perfume unique to late autumn in the quaint, slightly decaying coastal town of Port Blossom.  Rain threatened, clinging to the air in a heavy, expectant silence, mirroring the tension coiled in Mia’s own shoulders.  Port Blossom, with its charmingly crooked houses and perpetually stormy sky, was a picturesque postcard, but tonight, the picturesque felt oppressive.  Mia’s chiropractic clinic, "Hawthorne Holistic Health," was just around the corner, a small, brightly lit beacon against the encroaching darkness, and the only thing standing between her and the mounting pressure of a particularly demanding day.  Inside, the scent of lavender and eucalyptus would hopefully soothe, both her patients and herself.
