The biting wind whipped Dr. Evelyn Reed’s auburn braid across her face as she wrestled the recalcitrant gate open.  Rust groaned a mournful protest under the strain, mirroring the ache in her own bones after a grueling day spent delivering a calf in a blizzard and patching up a hawk with a broken wing.

The only sound louder than the wind was the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the reception area – a stark counterpoint to the howling wilderness beyond.  Evelyn shivered, not entirely from the cold.  A gnawing unease settled in her stomach, a feeling far colder than any mountain winter.  Tonight, she wasn't just treating animals; something felt profoundly… wrong.
