The recycled air hung thick and sweet with the cloying scent of jasmine perfume and stale coffee, a familiar aroma to Seraphina “Sera”  Montgomery.  Outside, the pre-dawn sky over the South China Sea bled from bruised purple to a hesitant, watery rose.  Sera, perched on a jump seat near the galley of Cathay Pacific flight CX887 from Hong Kong to Vancouver, idly polished her already gleaming name badge. The cabin was hushed, save for the low hum of the engines and the occasional soft sigh of a sleeping passenger.  Empty coffee cups and discarded magazines littered the tiny table beside her; remnants of a long, turbulent flight punctuated by screaming toddlers and a surprisingly heated debate about the merits of in-flight Wi-Fi.  Vancouver.  Home, in a way, even if "home" felt more like a collection of memories than a physical place these days.
