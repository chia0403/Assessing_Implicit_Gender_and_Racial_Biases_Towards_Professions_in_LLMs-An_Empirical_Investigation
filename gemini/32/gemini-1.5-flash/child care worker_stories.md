The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne's hair across her face as she hurried down Maple Street, the collar of her worn peacoat pulled high.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp leaves hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the brightly-lit windows of the Victorian houses lining the street, each one glowing warmly with the promise of family dinners and crackling fires.  Amelia, however, was headed towards a different kind of warmth, the kind found in the chaotic but loving embrace of Sunny Days Childcare.  Situated in a converted garage behind Mrs. Gable's rambling rose-covered house, Sunny Days was less a building and more a vibrant, slightly chaotic organism, pulsing with the energy of a dozen toddlers and the near-constant hum of a washing machine battling a mountain of tiny, mysteriously-stained clothes.  Tonight, however, the usual cheerful cacophony was muted, replaced by a nervous, anticipatory hush â€“ a hush that Amelia sensed held more than the usual pre-bedtime quiet.
