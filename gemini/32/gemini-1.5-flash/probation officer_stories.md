The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s auburn hair across her face as she navigated the crumbling steps leading to the dilapidated brick tenement building.  Number 14 Bleecker Street loomed before her, a monument to urban decay, its windows like vacant eyes staring out onto the bleak, rain-slicked alleyway.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp concrete, stale cigarettes, and something else…something subtly acrid, like burnt sugar and desperation.  Amelia, a probation officer for the city’s notoriously overcrowded and underfunded Department of Corrections, adjusted the collar of her worn wool coat, the familiar weight of her keys a small comfort in the chilling atmosphere.  Tonight's visit was to see Marcus Riley, a young man convicted of petty theft, whose increasingly erratic behaviour had Amelia seriously considering a violation of his probation.  The flickering neon sign of the "Golden Dragon" takeout across the street cast a lurid glow on the grimy brickwork, highlighting the peeling paint and the graffiti-covered walls that spoke volumes about the lives lived within. This wasn't Amelia's first foray into Bleecker Street's underbelly, but it was always a reminder of just how far the city's shadows could stretch.
