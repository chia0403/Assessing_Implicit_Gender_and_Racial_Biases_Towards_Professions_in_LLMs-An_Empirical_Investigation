The humid air hung thick and heavy, a shimmering veil over the mirrored walls of "Body & Soul Fitness."  Sweat beaded on the forehead of  Isabelle "Izzy" Diaz as she surveyed her 6 AM Spin class.  Izzy, with her fiery red hair pulled back in a tight bun and a determined glint in her usually sparkling brown eyes, adjusted the microphone clipped to her shirt.  The rhythmic thump of house music pulsed through the studio, a counterpoint to the anxious rustling of lycra and the nervous coughs of the early-morning fitness enthusiasts spread across their stationary bikes. Outside, the pre-dawn light was just beginning to paint the Los Angeles sky in shades of bruised purple and pale orange, a stark contrast to the neon-lit intensity of the gym.  The scent of chlorine from the adjacent pool mingled with the potent aroma of sweat and exertion, creating a uniquely invigorating, and somewhat pungent, atmosphere.  Today's class was particularly important; it was the final session of her eight-week "Shred Your Summer" program, and Izzy felt the weight of her clients' expectations—and her own self-imposed pressure—pressing down on her.
