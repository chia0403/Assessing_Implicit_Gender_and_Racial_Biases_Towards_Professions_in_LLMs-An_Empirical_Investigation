The scent of sandalwood and old paper hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the biting November wind whistling through the gaps in the warped windowpanes of Apothecary & Herbs.  Inside, amidst rows of amber jars brimming with dried herbs and meticulously labelled bottles of tinctures, stood Dr. Elara Vance, her brow furrowed in concentration as she meticulously weighed powdered valerian root.  The scales, ancient and brassy, creaked a mournful protest with each tiny shift of the weight.  Outside, the cobblestones of Oakhaven were slick with rain, reflecting the gaslight’s feeble glow in shimmering pools, a stark contrast to the warm, earthy aroma that permeated Elara’s sanctuary.  The apothecary, nestled on a quiet side street, felt worlds away from the bustling market square just a block over, a secret haven preserved in time, much like Elara herself.
