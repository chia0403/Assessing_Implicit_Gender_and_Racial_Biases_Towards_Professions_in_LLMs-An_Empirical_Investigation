Barty himself, a man whose age was as indecipherable as the stains on his worn leather apron, sat perched on a three-legged stool, the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of his shears a counterpoint to the cicadas' relentless drone.  His barbershop, a cramped, single-room affair nestled on the edge of bayou country, smelled of bay rum, old wood, and a faint, indefinable sweetness that might have been honeysuckle or something altogether more mysterious.  Dust motes danced in the shafts of sunlight that pierced the gaps in the slatted blinds, illuminating the chipped porcelain sink and the cracked mirror reflecting a life lived mostly in quiet contemplation.  Today, however, the quiet was broken, not by the usual humdrum chatter of the townâ€™s gossips, but by a nervous tapping at the door.
