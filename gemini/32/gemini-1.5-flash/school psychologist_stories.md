The flickering fluorescent lights of Northwood High hummed a discordant symphony, a soundtrack to Dr. Eleanor Vanceâ€™s late-night solitude.  Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of her office, blurring the already indistinct cityscape into a hazy watercolor of grey and black.  The scent of old paper and stale coffee hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Eleanor, a comforting blanket against the emotional turbulence she often navigated within these walls.  Tonight, however, the silence felt heavier, more oppressive than usual.  The usual chaotic energy of a high school, usually echoing faintly through the floorboards even at this hour, was absent, replaced by an unnerving stillness that prickled at the back of her neck.  It wasn't the silence itself that bothered her, but the feeling that something profound and unsettling was lurking just beneath the surface, hidden amidst the neatly stacked files and the comforting weight of her worn copy of "The Interpretation of Dreams."
