The biting Antarctic wind howled a mournful song around Dr. Aris Thorneâ€™s research station, a symphony of ice cracking and groaning punctuated by the rhythmic whir of the wind turbines.  Aris, bundled in layers of thermal gear that felt more like a spacesuit than clothing, squinted at the swirling snow obscuring the desolate landscape.  The Vostok Station, usually a starkly beautiful expanse of white, was today a blurry, almost malevolent canvas of blizzard fury.  Inside, the warmth of the station was a deceptive comfort; the air hung heavy with the scent of ozone and the underlying, ever-present tang of diesel fuel, a testament to the precarious balance between human life and the unforgiving wilderness.  This was not the serene scientific paradise Aris had envisioned when he'd first applied for the Antarctic research grant; this was survival.  And tonight, survival felt particularly tenuous.
