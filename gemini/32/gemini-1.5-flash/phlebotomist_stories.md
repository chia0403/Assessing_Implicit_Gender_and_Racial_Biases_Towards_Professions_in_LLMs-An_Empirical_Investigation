The fluorescent lights of the Meadowbrook Medical Clinic hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* of Amelia Katherine "Amy" Holloway's own heart.  It wasn't the usual pre-shift jitters; Amy, a phlebotomist with five years under her belt at Meadowbrook, had long since mastered the art of appearing calm even when faced with a vein that resembled a particularly stubborn earthworm. No, this was different.  This morning, a palpable tension hung in the air, thicker than the antiseptic smell clinging to the examination room curtains.  The usual pre-dawn bustle of nurses prepping rooms and doctors murmuring over charts felt… muted, almost hushed, replaced by a nervous energy that prickled Amy's skin.  The rain lashed against the panoramic windows overlooking the perpetually grey November sky, mirroring the storm brewing inside her. Today, she wasn't just drawing blood; she felt like she was drawing closer to something… unsettling.
