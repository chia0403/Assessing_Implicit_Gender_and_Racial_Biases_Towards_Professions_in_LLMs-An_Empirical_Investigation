The chipped Formica countertop felt cool beneath Elias Thorne's forearms, a welcome contrast to the humid, breathless air hanging thick in "The Rusty Mug."  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the neon glow of the liquor store across the street into a hazy, psychedelic smear.  Elias, a man sculpted from years of late nights and even later regrets, wiped down the already spotless surface with a practiced hand.  The only sound louder than the drumming rain was the rhythmic clinking of ice in the almost-empty glass he polished, a soundtrack to the quiet desperation clinging to the air like the scent of stale beer and regret.  Outside, the city of Porthaven roared, but inside The Rusty Mug, only the slow drip of a leaky faucet punctuated the silence between the occasional mournful sigh of a lonely patron.
