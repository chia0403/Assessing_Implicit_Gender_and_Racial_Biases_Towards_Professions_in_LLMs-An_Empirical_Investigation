The rasp of steel on bone echoed through the chill morning air, a sound as familiar to Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield as the smell of sawdust and blood that clung to his apron like a second skin.  Barty, owner and sole operator of Butterfield's Quality Meats, stood hunched over a side of beef, his broad shoulders almost swallowed by the cavernous coolness of his shop.  The air hung heavy with the scent of aged oak, rendered fat, and something else… something faintly metallic and unsettling that wasn't quite the usual aroma of his trade.  Outside, the cobbled streets of Oakhaven were just beginning to stir, a thin veil of mist clinging to the gas lamps, painting the town in muted grays and blues.  But inside Butterfield's, the only light came from a single, flickering gas jet above his work table, casting long, dancing shadows that played tricks on the eye.  This wasn't just another Tuesday morning at the butcher shop; something felt… off.
