The chipped porcelain teacup rattled in Seraphina "Sera" Nightingale's trembling hand, the floral pattern blurring through a film of unshed tears.  Rain lashed against the single, grime-coated window of her attic room, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single bare bulb hanging precariously from the ceiling, danced in the swirling air, each one a tiny, melancholic ghost of a forgotten melody.  The room itself, perched high above the bustling cobbled streets of Prague's Old Town, was a chaotic symphony of forgotten dreams: half-finished sheet music spilled from overflowing drawers, a battered guitar lay abandoned in the corner, its strings rusted and silent, and a stack of rejection letters, taller than Sera herself, leaned against a crumbling bookshelf.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp plaster and the lingering ghost of burnt coffee, a fitting aroma for a singer whose career was currently as flat as her bank account.
