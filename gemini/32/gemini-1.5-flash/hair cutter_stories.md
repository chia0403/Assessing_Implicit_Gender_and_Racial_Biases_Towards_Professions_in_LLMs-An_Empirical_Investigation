The scent of lavender and ozone hung heavy in the air, a peculiar but comforting blend unique to "Shear Perfection," Aurelia "Auri" Blackwood's tiny salon nestled on a cobbled side street in the ancient, atmospheric town of Oakhaven.  Rain lashed against the leaded-glass windows, blurring the already indistinct gaslight glow of the street outside.  Inside, the flickering candlelight on Auri's mahogany styling station cast dancing shadows on the worn, but meticulously clean, checkered floor.  The only sound besides the drumming rain was the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of Auri's shears, a practiced, almost hypnotic sound that mirrored the steady beat of her heart.  Tonight, however, even the familiar rhythm felt slightly off-kilter.  A nervous tremor ran through Auri’s usually steady hand as she worked on a particularly intricate braid, a knot of anxiety tightening in her stomach.  Something felt…wrong.
