The rasping cough that wracked Elias Thorne's body was a familiar companion these days, as familiar as the smell of sun-baked earth and the lowing of his prize Hereford bull.  Dust, fine as powdered bone, clung to everything in the parched valley of Dustbowl Creek, coating the cracked earth, the withered corn stalks, and Elias himself, a man hardened by years of unforgiving sun and relentless toil.  His weathered face, etched with a network of wrinkles that spoke of hardship and resilience, was framed by a shock of stubbornly gray hair that refused to be tamed by any wind, however fierce.  The year was 1936, and the drought, a cruel, relentless beast, had choked the life from the land, leaving behind only a desolate whisper of what once was a thriving farm.  The only sound louder than Elias's ragged breathing was the mournful creak of his old porch swing, swaying gently in the oppressive stillness of the Oklahoma afternoon.
