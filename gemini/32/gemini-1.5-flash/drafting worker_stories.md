The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune above Elias Thorne's head, a counterpoint to the rhythmic scratch of his pencil on mylar.  Dust motes, illuminated like tiny galaxies, danced in the pale light filtering through the grimy window of his cramped cubicle.  Elias, a man whose life seemed as meticulously organized as the blueprints spilling across his desk, adjusted his glasses, the thin wire digging into the bridge of his nose.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and the faintly acrid smell of developing chemicals from the drafting room down the hall â€“ the olfactory signature of Architectural Designs Incorporated, a firm where ambition was as plentiful as the chipped drafting tables.  Outside, the relentless Chicago wind howled, a stark contrast to the quiet, almost monastic, concentration required within the walls of ADI.  Tonight, however, the usual hum of focused industry was punctuated by an unsettling silence, broken only by the occasional clatter of a distant file cabinet and Elias's own increasingly frantic scribbling.  Something was wrong.  Terribly wrong.
