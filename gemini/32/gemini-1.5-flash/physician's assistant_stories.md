The salt spray stung Evelyn Reed's face as the ferry churned its way across the choppy waters of Puget Sound.  Rain, a persistent drizzle that clung to everything like a damp shroud, plastered her dark hair to her forehead.  Around her, the other commuters huddled deeper into their coats, their faces grim against the relentless wind.  But Evelyn, despite the chill that seeped into her bones, felt a familiar thrill.  She was returning to Bainbridge Island, a place of brooding evergreen forests and craggy cliffs, a place she’d both loved and loathed since moving there five years ago to work at the island’s only clinic, a small, understaffed, and perpetually overwhelmed medical facility clinging precariously to the edge of Winslow. The scent of pine and the distant mournful cry of a seagull were, to her, the comforting aromas of home and the unsettling soundtrack of impending chaos.  Today’s chaos, however, promised to be particularly pungent.  Dr. Albright, her perpetually stressed employer, had called just before she’d boarded, his voice a strained whisper barely audible over the ferry’s engine.  It involved a fishing boat, a storm, and a situation significantly more complicated than a simple case of seasickness.
