The air, thick with the scent of wet concrete and exhaust fumes, carried the distant, mournful wail of a siren – a familiar soundtrack to Elias’s life.  He shivered, not entirely from the cold, but from the gnawing unease that had settled in his gut since the foreman’s cryptic warning that morning: "Stay sharp, Thorne.  Something's not right about this job."
