The rasping shriek of metal on metal, a sound familiar as his own heartbeat, sliced through the pre-dawn quiet.  Elias Thorne, his breath clouding in the frigid October air, squinted at the crumpled remains of a semi-trailer jackknifed across the southbound lanes of Interstate 40.  Crimson paint, chipped and flaking like old skin, bled across the asphalt.  The air hung heavy with the smell of diesel and something acrid, something metallic and sickeningly sweet.  This wasn't Elias's first rodeo, not by a long shot.  He'd seen worse.  But even after twenty years spent battling the brutal realities of highway maintenance in the unforgiving expanse of New Mexico, the sight still clawed at his gut.  The rising sun cast a pale, sickly light on the wreckage, illuminating the desolate landscape: miles of endless asphalt stretching towards the hazy purple mountains in the distance, punctuated only by the skeletal remains of abandoned gas stations and the occasional lonely tumbleweed.
