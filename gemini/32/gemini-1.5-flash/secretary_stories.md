Rain lashed against the gothic windows of Blackwood & Sons Solicitors, a relentless drumming that mirrored the frantic beat of Amelia’s own heart.  Outside, the city of Edinburgh hunched under a bruised, indigo sky, the gaslights casting a jaundiced glow on the slick cobblestones. Inside, the only illumination came from the single desk lamp illuminating the mountain of paperwork threatening to engulf her – contracts, wills, and the ever-present, ominous-looking files marked 'Confidential'.  The air hung heavy with the scent of old leather, damp wool, and something faintly metallic, a smell Amelia had come to associate with the unsettling mysteries that often unfolded within the hallowed (and slightly decaying) walls of Blackwood & Sons.
