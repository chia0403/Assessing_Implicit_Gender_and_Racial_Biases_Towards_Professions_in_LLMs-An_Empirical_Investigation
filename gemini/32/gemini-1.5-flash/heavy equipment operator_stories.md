The diesel engine coughed, a phlegmy groan that vibrated through the worn steel of the cab.  Dust, the fine ochre grit of the Arizona desert, swirled around the massive treads of Beatrice "Bea" Mallory's bulldozer, painting the already-scorching landscape in hazy, shimmering waves.  The sun, a malevolent eye in the cloudless sky, beat down mercilessly, baking the earth to a near-molten state.  Bea squinted, shielding her eyes with a hand that was already tanned the color of saddle leather.  Sweat trickled down her temple, mingling with the grime permanently etched into her skin â€“ the occupational hazard of a life spent wrestling behemoths of metal across unforgiving terrain.  She adjusted the cracked brim of her faded baseball cap, the worn logo of a long-defunct construction company barely visible beneath a layer of dust. This wasn't just a job; it was a baptism by fire, and today's baptism promised to be particularly brutal. The foreman's radio crackled with instructions, his voice tight with urgency.  The deadline loomed, the desert stretched endlessly before her, and Bea knew this was going to be a long, hot day.
