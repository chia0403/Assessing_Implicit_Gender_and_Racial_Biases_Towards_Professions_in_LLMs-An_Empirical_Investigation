Dust motes, illuminated by the harsh fluorescent lights, danced in the silent space between rows of gleaming, impossibly expensive cars.  Amelia Katherine “Amy” Finch, her perfectly coiffed auburn bob threatening to wilt under the oppressive heat, adjusted the pristine white collar of her blouse.  It was already past five, the sun had long since dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows that seemed to mimic the lengthening shadow of her dwindling commission.  Another day, another near-miss.  Another potential customer, Mr. Henderson, who’d promised to return “after thinking it over,” a phrase Amy had come to recognize as code for “I’m never buying a car from you.”
