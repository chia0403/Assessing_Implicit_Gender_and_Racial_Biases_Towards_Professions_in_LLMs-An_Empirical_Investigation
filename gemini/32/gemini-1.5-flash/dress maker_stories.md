The scent of lavender and old silk hung heavy in the air, a comforting perfume that clung to the dusty velvet curtains and the chipped porcelain figurines lining the shelves of Esme Willowick's atelier.  Sunlight, fractured by the leaded-glass windowpanes, dappled the worn wooden floorboards, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the golden shafts.  Esme Willowick herself, a woman whose age was as subtly layered as the finest brocade, sat hunched over a half-finished gown, her nimble fingers coaxing a rebellious seam into submission.  The atelier, nestled on a cobbled lane tucked away in the heart of the ancient city of Porthaven, was a haven of quiet creativity, a stark contrast to the bustling port life that throbbed just beyond its walls.  The rhythmic click-clack of her needle against the fabric was the only sound that broke the stillness, a counterpoint to the distant cries of gulls and the rumble of carts on the cobblestones.
