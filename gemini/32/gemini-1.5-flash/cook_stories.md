The salt spray kissed Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's face as she hauled the last crate of iridescent Manila clams aboard the *Sea Serpent*.  The late afternoon sun, a molten orange orb sinking towards the churning grey horizon of the Irish Sea, cast long shadows across the bobbing deck.  The air, thick with the briney tang of the ocean and the sharp, sweet scent of seaweed, clung to her like a damp wool shawl. Amy, her hands raw and blistered, wiped a smear of seawater from her cheek, a grimace playing on her lips.  The successful haul was a welcome sight, but the real work – transforming these treasures into culinary magic – still lay ahead.  Her tiny, weather-beaten galley aboard the *Sea Serpent*, barely bigger than a walk-in closet, awaited her, promising a night filled with the comforting rhythm of chopping, simmering, and the satisfying sizzle of perfectly seasoned seafood.
