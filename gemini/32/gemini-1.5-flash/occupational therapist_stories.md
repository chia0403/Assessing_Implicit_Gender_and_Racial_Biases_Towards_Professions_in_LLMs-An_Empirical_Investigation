The salt spray stung Eleanor Vance's face as she wrestled the stubborn fishing boat door open.  The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum sinking below the churning Atlantic, cast long shadows across the deck, painting the worn wood in hues of violet and deep orange.  The air, thick with the smell of brine and diesel, vibrated with the rhythmic thrum of the small engine, a counterpoint to the cries of gulls overhead.  Eleanor, a thirty-something occupational therapist with hands perpetually stained with a mixture of ink and surprisingly resilient glitter (a testament to her clientele), gripped the railing, her gaze fixed on the ramshackle cottage clinging precariously to the cliff face above the tiny harbour of Port Blossom, Maine.  This wasn't exactly the serene, sun-drenched rehabilitation centre she'd envisioned when she'd accepted this new post, but then again, nothing about her life in Port Blossom had been quite what sheâ€™d expected.
