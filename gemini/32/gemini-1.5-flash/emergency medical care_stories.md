The biting November wind howled a mournful dirge across the desolate expanse of the salt marshes, whipping Amelia Katherine “Amy” Reed’s already wind-chapped face raw.  The skeletal branches of the black mangroves clawed at the sky, their gnarled fingers silhouetted against the bruised purple of the twilight. Amy shivered, pulling her threadbare fleece tighter around her.  The battered Ford Ranger, its headlights cutting feeble swathes through the encroaching darkness, coughed and sputtered, mirroring the erratic rhythm of her own anxious heart.  This wasn't the manicured suburban sprawl of the emergency room at County General; this was the unforgiving, wild heart of the Outer Banks, where the only sirens were the cries of gulls and the relentless roar of the Atlantic.  Tonight, however, a different kind of distress call had summoned her: a frantic message relayed through static-laced radio, a plea for help from a remote fishing village swallowed by the encroaching night.  Amy gripped the steering wheel, her knuckles white.  Another night, another desperate soul clinging to life on the edge of nowhere.
