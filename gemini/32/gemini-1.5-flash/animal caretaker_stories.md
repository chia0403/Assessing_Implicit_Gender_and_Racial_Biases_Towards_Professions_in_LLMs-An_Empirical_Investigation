The biting November wind whipped Amelia Hawthorne’s auburn braid across her face as she wrestled a recalcitrant bale of hay.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and woodsmoke, stung her nostrils, a familiar perfume in the twilight gloom of the Whispering Pines Animal Sanctuary.  Around her, the sanctuary’s sprawling grounds – a haphazard collection of repurposed barns, rambling outbuildings, and meticulously crafted enclosures – were settling into the quietude of evening.  The last slivers of sun bled across the snow-dusted fields, casting long, skeletal shadows from the ancient oaks that guarded the sanctuary’s perimeter.  Amelia, her breath misting in the cold, tugged the hay bale closer to the weathered wooden fence surrounding the llama enclosure, a low, rumbling grumble emanating from within, a clear indication that Señor Fluffybutt, the resident alpaca with a penchant for dramatic sighs, was expecting his supper.
