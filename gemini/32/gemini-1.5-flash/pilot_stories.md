The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful song around Captain Evelyn "Evie"  Montgomery's weathered Cessna 185, its icy breath frosting the already-pristine snow blanketing the vast expanse of Denali National Park.  The sun, a pale disc barely peeking over the jagged peaks of the Alaska Range, cast long, skeletal shadows that danced across the frozen landscape. Evie shivered, pulling her thick fur-lined parka tighter, the scent of pine and frozen earth filling her lungs.  Below, the Taiga stretched out, an endless tapestry of white and dark green, broken only by the occasional, dark silhouette of a spruce tree clinging stubbornly to life.  This was her office, her playground, her prison â€“ depending on the day.  And today, the air hung heavy with the promise of a long, perilous flight.
