The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of frangipani and something faintly…rotten.  Amelia “Mia” Hernandez adjusted the brim of her wide-brimmed hat, the straw scratching against her forehead.  Sweat beaded on her upper lip, despite the relative coolness of the early morning.  The sun, a molten orange orb, peeked over the jagged silhouette of the Mayan ruins of Ek Balam, its light glinting off the weathered limestone.  Tourists, a gaggle of bleary-eyed early risers mostly clad in ill-fitting khaki shorts and sunscreen-slicked skin, were already assembling at the entrance, their hushed whispers a counterpoint to the chirping of unseen birds deep within the jungle.  Mia, however, wasn't yet focused on them.  Her gaze lingered on a strangely disturbed patch of earth near the base of the main pyramid, a small, almost imperceptible tremor still vibrating in the air. This wasn't in the tour guide brochure.
