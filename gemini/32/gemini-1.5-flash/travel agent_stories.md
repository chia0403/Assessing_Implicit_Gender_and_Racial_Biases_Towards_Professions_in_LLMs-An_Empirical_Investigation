The chipped porcelain cat, a souvenir from a trip to Kyoto that Amelia Hawthorne had long since forgotten the details of, stared accusingly from Amelia’s desk.  Dust motes, illuminated by the weak afternoon sun slanting through the grimy window of her travel agency, danced in the air around it.  “Amelia Hawthorne, Independent Travel Consultant,” the faded gold lettering on the door proclaimed, a lie only slightly mitigated by the equally faded “By Appointment Only” sign tacked haphazardly beneath it.  The shop, tucked away on a cobbled side street in the shadow of Edinburgh Castle, smelled faintly of old paper, forgotten dreams, and the lingering scent of sandalwood incense from a particularly enthusiastic client's request for a spiritual retreat in Bali – a retreat that, Amelia ruefully noted, had apparently been less spiritually fulfilling and more spiritually terrifying, judging by the frantic email she’d received just that morning.  The only other sound besides the tick-tock of a grandfather clock that probably hadn’t been wound in years, was the mournful sigh of the wind whistling through a crack in the windowpane.
