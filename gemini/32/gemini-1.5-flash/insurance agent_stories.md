The chipped paint of Amelia "Amy" Hernandez's 1998 Honda Civic crunched under the tires as she navigated the rutted driveway of the Blackwood Manor.  A skeletal oak, its branches like gnarled fingers clawing at the bruised twilight sky, loomed over the crumbling Victorian, its stained-glass windows glittering like shattered jewels.  Amy, a woman whose life was usually measured in spreadsheets and risk assessments, felt a prickle of unease crawl up her spine.  This wasn't the usual suburban sprawl she insured; this was a gothic nightmare draped in creeping ivy, and tonight, it was her latest client.  The scent of damp earth and decaying leaves hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the sterile aroma of her office back in the city.  Her breath hitched in her chest.  This wasn't just a house; it felt like a mausoleum waiting to happen.
