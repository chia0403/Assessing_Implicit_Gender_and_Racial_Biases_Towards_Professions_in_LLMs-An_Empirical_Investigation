The biting wind whipped Amelia Kensington's hair across her face as she surveyed the desolate expanse of the coastal cliffs.  Rain, thick and persistent, plastered the already-grey sky to the horizon.  Below, the churning Atlantic roared like a caged beast, its spray threatening to engulf the small, weathered lighthouse perched precariously on the outcrop.  This was her territory, or rather, the territory of her patients.  Amelia, Physical Therapist, specializing in post-traumatic rehabilitation, knew the relentless beauty and brutal unforgivingness of this place intimately.  Her small, battered Jeep, a reliable companion through countless storms, was parked at the base of the climb, its wipers battling the onslaught of the elements like tireless, determined soldiers.  Amelia, her parka pulled tight against the cold, adjusted her pack.  Inside, nestled amongst layers of wool and waterproof fabric, lay the tools of her trade:  a collection of therapeutic exercises, her worn copy of "Anatomy for Rehabilitation," and a surprisingly well-preserved supply of colourful resistance bands.
