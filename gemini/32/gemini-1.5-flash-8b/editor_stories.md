The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Crimson Quill" office hummed, a soundtrack to the rhythmic clack of Amelia Blackwood’s keyboard.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of afternoon sun piercing the grime-coated window, illuminating a chaotic landscape of half-eaten takeout containers, crumpled manuscripts, and overflowing coffee cups.  Amelia, a senior editor at Blackwood & Quill Publishing, hunched over her desk, the scent of old paper and stale coffee a familiar comfort.  The year was 2042, and the once-vibrant publishing industry, struggling to adapt to the rise of digital media, felt as brittle as the antique typewriters gathering dust in the back room.  Amelia’s particular corner of the office, a small, slightly cramped space, was surrounded by the ghosts of countless rejected novels, poems lost to the ether, and the barely contained frustration of authors clinging to the fading promise of print.
