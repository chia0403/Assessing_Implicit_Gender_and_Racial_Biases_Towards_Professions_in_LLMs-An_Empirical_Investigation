The fluorescent lights of the law firm hummed, a constant, irritating drone that echoed the relentless rhythm of Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's life.  She hunched over a legal document, the yellowed paper reflecting the harsh glare.  The air, thick with the scent of stale coffee and legal pads, felt heavier than the caseload piling up on her desk.  Amy, a paralegal at the prestigious firm of Sterling & Stone, meticulously cross-referenced a witness statement, each typed word a tiny victory in the battle against overwhelming paperwork.  This particular case, *Doe v. Consolidated Industries*, smelled of corporate greed and environmental negligence.  Amy, despite the monotonous nature of her work, felt a spark of righteous indignation; she believed she could see the corruption behind the legal jargon.


The firm, a granite behemoth rising out of the gray, perpetually overcast city skyline, housed a labyrinthine interior.  Gleaming marble hallways, lined with impossibly expensive art, whispered stories of wealth and power.  Amy's office, tucked away on a far corner of the second floor, was a stark contrast.  Minimalist, utilitarian, and perpetually cluttered, it contained a half-eaten takeout container, a stack of forgotten files, and a worn copy of "A Tale of Two Cities."  From her window, Amy could see the bustling, almost chaotic, urban landscape stretching out beneath her.  The constant drone of city life, with its rhythmic clang of metal on metal, sirens wailing in the distance, seemed to mirror the endless stream of documents she was processing.
