The chipped porcelain sink in the staff restroom of the Blackwood Public Library hummed softly, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* of Amelia Blackwood's heart.  Amelia, a librarian with eyes the colour of faded autumn leaves and hair the shade of midnight, stared at her reflection.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of sunlight piercing the grimy window, mirroring the swirling anxieties in her stomach.  Today, a new book arrived â€“ a rare first edition of "Whispers of the Weeping Woods," rumored to contain unsettling prophecies.  And she, Amelia Blackwood, was the one chosen to catalogue it.

The library itself was a monument to time, a hushed cathedral of aged paper and leather-bound volumes.  Sunlight slanted through the stained-glass windows, depicting mythical creatures and forgotten saints, illuminating dust motes and casting long shadows over the towering shelves that stretched into the gloom.  The air smelled of aged paper, stale coffee, and something else... something indefinably... *wrong*.  A constant, low hum seemed to vibrate from the very foundations, a presence that pressed on her skin like an unseen hand.  This wasn't just any library; Blackwood Public was said to be haunted by the spirits of the forgotten stories it held.  And Amelia felt, for the first time, truly uneasy about her duty.
