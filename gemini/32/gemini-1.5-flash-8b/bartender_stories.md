The flickering neon sign of the "Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow across Amelia "Ace"  Montgomery's face.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom of the bar.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless percussion that mirrored the pounding rhythm of Ace's heart.  She wiped down the sticky mahogany bar top, the worn wood a familiar comfort beneath her calloused fingers.  Tonight, the Rusty Mug was quieter than usual, a mausoleum of whispered conversations and the clinking of ice.  

The setting:  Dust Bowl Oklahoma, 1939.  The town of Dust Creek, nestled in the parched landscape, was a ghost town of its own.  Desperation clung to the air like the dust that perpetually coated everything.  The Rusty Mug, a once-bustling watering hole, was now a lifeline for the dwindling population, a place where men and women alike sought solace, or perhaps just a moment to forget the relentless drought.  The air was thick with the smell of dust and despair, and the only sound louder than the rain was the quiet hum of unspoken anxieties.  A lone dust devil spiralled just outside the doorway, a miniature tornado in a barren wasteland.
