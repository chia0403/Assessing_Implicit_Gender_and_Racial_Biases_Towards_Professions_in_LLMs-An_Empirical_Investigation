The scent of jasmine, a heady perfume that usually calmed Amelia Blackwood, felt oppressive this morning.  Dust motes danced in the shafts of pale sunlight slicing through the grimy windows of her small shop, "Blooms by the Bay," clinging to the delicate spider lilies and the vibrant orchids that were supposed to be vibrant. Instead, they seemed muted, mirroring the muted mood within her.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless drumbeat that mirrored the frantic rhythm of her thoughts.  Outside, the cobbled streets of the old port town, normally buzzing with the cheerful chaos of fishermen and tourists, were eerily silent.  Today, only the wind whispered secrets through the deserted alleys.

Amelia, a slender woman with eyes the colour of forget-me-nots, stood hunched over a dilapidated wooden table, meticulously arranging a bouquet.  Each stem, each petal, seemed to carry a weight heavier than it should. The shop itself was a testament to the passage of time; faded floral wallpaper clung to the walls, antique mirrors reflecting the gloom, and the scent of old paper and damp earth mingled with the floral aroma.  Her small shop was tucked away on a quiet side street of Port Alderney, a town nestled between the churning grey waters of the North Sea and steep, moss-covered cliffs that seemed to hold their breath in anticipation. A constant salty mist swirled around the building, giving everything a perpetual, slightly humid air.  The relentless wind, a familiar presence, whistled through the cracks in the windowpanes.  Amelia knew the storms, both literal and metaphorical, were just beginning.
