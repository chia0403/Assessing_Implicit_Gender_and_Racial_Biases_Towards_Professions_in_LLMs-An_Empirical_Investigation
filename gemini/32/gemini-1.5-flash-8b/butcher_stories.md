The chill of the early November air snaked through the gaps in the boarded-up windows of the "Bloody Cleaver" butcher shop, clinging to the sawdust-dusted floors and the damp, stainless steel of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's work surfaces.  Rain hammered against the corrugated metal roof, a relentless percussion that echoed the insistent rhythm of Barty's cleaver against the thick slabs of beef.  Steam, thick and white, curled from the bubbling cauldrons of simmering broth, mingling with the pungent aroma of roasting herbs and the slightly metallic tang of freshly slaughtered pork.  Barty, his face etched with the grime of a lifetime spent surrounded by blood and bone, was hunched over a massive hunk of venison, its rich crimson a stark contrast against the muted grey of the shop. Outside, the skeletal branches of the ancient oak trees clawed at the sky, their gnarled fingers mirroring the knots and veins that crisscrossed the muscle tissue he meticulously studied.  The year was 1888, and the city of Oakhaven, nestled between the Appalachian foothills and the relentless churning of the Ohio River, held its breath, waiting for winter's icy grip.
