The biting November wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks with icy needles.  Rain, thick and relentless, hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the abandoned cinema, a symphony of despair echoing the emptiness inside.

This wasn't some lavish, sun-drenched set; this was the heart of the ruin, a place where ambition had withered and the only soundtrack was the mournful drip of water.  Amelia, eyes narrowed against the downpour, traced the faded gold lettering on the marquee:  "Roxy Palace - Where Dreams Played." Her breath fogged in the air.  This was her inspiration, her nemesis, her muse â€“ and the setting for her next masterpiece.
