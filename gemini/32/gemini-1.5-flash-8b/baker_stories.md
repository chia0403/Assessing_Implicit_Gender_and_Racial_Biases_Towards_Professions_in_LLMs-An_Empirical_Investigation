The aroma of freshly baked sourdough, sharp and tangy, hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint scent of woodsmoke from the nearby river.  Sunlight, fractured by the leaves of ancient oaks, dappled the cobblestone streets of the village of Oakhaven.  It was a crisp autumn morning, the kind that painted the sky with bruised purples and fiery oranges, and the perfect time for a burgeoning baker like Amelia Blackwood to hone her craft. Amelia, with her flour-dusted apron and a determined glint in her hazel eyes, stood at the heart of her tiny bakery, "The Golden Crust," kneading a dough that promised a symphony of flavour.  The rhythmic thump of her hands against the warm, yielding surface echoed through the quiet shop, a counterpoint to the gentle chirping of the birds in the nearby trees.
