The fluorescent lights of the probation office hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's life.  The sterile white walls, the beige linoleum floor, and the ever-present smell of stale coffee â€“ all conspired to make the space feel more like a waiting room in a hospital than a place where lives were sculpted, or, all too often, shattered.  Amy, a probation officer for the Juvenile Court in the gritty, industrial city of Newhaven, leaned back in her worn leather chair, staring at the meticulously organized file folder in front of her. Inside, nestled amongst meticulously documented violations and progress reports, lay the details of sixteen-year-old Leo Jensen's latest infraction: reckless driving, resulting in minor injuries to a pedestrian.

The city of Newhaven, nestled between the towering smokestacks of forgotten factories and the sprawling, neglected riverfront, held a perpetual twilight.  A haze of pollution hung low, clinging to the brick facades of the decaying neighbourhoods that dotted the landscape.  Amy knew these streets intimately, the shortcuts and hidden alleys, the quiet desperation that clung to every corner.  The juvenile detention centre, a grim, imposing structure of reinforced concrete and razor wire, loomed over the district, a constant reminder of the consequences that awaited those who strayed from the straight and narrow.  The cold, damp air whispered tales of broken promises and unanswered questions.  Today, though, Amy was facing another quiet, frustrating case; a face to a name, a soul behind a series of infractions, all waiting for her judgment.
