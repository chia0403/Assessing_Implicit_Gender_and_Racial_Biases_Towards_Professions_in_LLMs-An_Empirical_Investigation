The wind, a razor-sharp blade, whipped across the manicured lawns of Blackwood Manor, tugging at the vibrant crimson roses that clung to their trellises like defiant banners.  Rain, the colour of gunmetal, hammered against the slate roof, mirroring the storm brewing within Elara Blackwood, the estate's head landscaper.  Her full name, Elara Blackwood, felt almost ironic, a cruel twist of fate considering the animosity she often felt toward the family whose property she tended.  She knelt, her fingers tracing the delicate veins of a fern, desperately seeking a semblance of order in the chaos swirling around her.


Setting: Blackwood Manor, a sprawling gothic estate nestled within the whispering woods of the Ashdown Valley.  Grey stone walls, weathered and moss-covered, rose majestically towards a leaden sky.  The gardens, meticulously designed and maintained, were a stark contrast to the tempestuous weather.  Within them, lush hedges, sculpted topiary, and riotous blooms vied for attention, a testament to Elara's dedicationâ€”and a silent reproach to the often-inattentive Blackwood family.
