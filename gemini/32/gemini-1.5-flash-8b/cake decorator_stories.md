The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the cluttered workshop, illuminating the swirling clouds of icing sugar that clung to the air like a fine, ethereal mist.  Amelia "Amy" Nightingale, her apron stained a delicate shade of pistachio green, meticulously piped a perfect rose onto the sculpted sugar-paste crown of a wedding cake.  Tiny, almost invisible, pearls of edible glitter clung to the petals, reflecting the faint glow of the lamp.  The scent of vanilla, almond, and rosewater filled the air, a fragrant symphony only a cake decorator could appreciate.

Amyâ€™s workshop, tucked away on a narrow cobbled street in the heart of the burgeoning Victorian city of Alderbrook, was a testament to her passion and her peculiar skill.  Rows of intricately designed tins held hundreds of miniature edible flowers, their petals vibrant with colour.  A half-eaten loaf of sourdough bread sat on a wobbly stool alongside a stack of blueprints for elaborate tiered towers of sugar and whipped cream.  Paint-splattered canvases, canvases with designs that echoed the delicate floral patterns Amy was so skilled at creating, hung from the blackened walls, a reminder of her other, slightly neglected, passion for art.  Dust motes danced in the beams of light that pierced the gloom from the few small windows, whispering tales of long nights spent crafting confectionery dreams.
