The sterile, white fluorescent hum of the operating room vibrated through Dr. Eleanor Vance's bones, a counterpoint to the frantic rhythm of her own heart.  Crimson splatters marred the pristine white drapes, a stark reminder of the life – or, perhaps more accurately, the fragments of a life –  before her.  The patient, a young woman named Anya Petrova, lay still beneath the surgical lights, her breathing shallow, a fragile whisper against the mechanical hum of the life-support machines.

Setting:  The operating theatre at St. Jude's Hospital, a sprawling, century-old institution in the heart of the sprawling metropolis of Nova-Alexandria.  The city itself, a tapestry woven from gleaming skyscrapers piercing a perpetually overcast sky, was a stark contrast to the serene, if now tainted, quiet of the operating room.  The air hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and fear, a scent Dr. Vance knew all too well, a familiar companion on this, her tenth year on the surgical staff.
