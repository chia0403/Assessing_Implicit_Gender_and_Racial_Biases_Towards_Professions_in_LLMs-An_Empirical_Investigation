The biting November wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's faded, navy blue jacket around her as she surveyed the overgrown borders of Blackwood Manor.  A relentless, icy rain had hammered the grounds all night, leaving the sculpted hedges flattened and the manicured lawns resembling a battlefield.  Twisted branches clawed at the overcast sky, mirroring the turmoil Amelia felt inside.  She, Amelia Blackwood, groundskeeper for Blackwood Manor, the grand estate that seemed to have swallowed generations of her family, was once again facing a monumental task, one that threatened to consume her very soul.

The estate itself, a sprawling expanse of grey stone and slate roofs, loomed over her.  Its imposing grandeur was a cruel contrast to the desolate landscape.  Towering oaks, once majestic, now bore a skeletal resemblance to weeping willows, their branches laden with the remnants of rain-soaked leaves.  The scent of damp earth and decaying foliage hung heavy in the air, a thick, earthy perfume that seemed to mock Amelia's tireless efforts.  A network of winding paths, once meticulously maintained, were now choked with fallen leaves and stray branches, their original beauty obscured by the relentless storm.  The wrought-iron gates, usually gleaming, were now dulled and obscured by the unrelenting downpour.  And within the shadowed recesses of the manor, whispers of secrets and forgotten tragedies seemed to cling to the very stones, mocking her quiet efforts to keep its external decay at bay.
