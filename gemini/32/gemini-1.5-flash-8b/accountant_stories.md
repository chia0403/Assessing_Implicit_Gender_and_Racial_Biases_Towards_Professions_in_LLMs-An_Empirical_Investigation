Now, just three quarters in, NovaFlux's projections were crumbling faster than a sandcastle in a storm.  The faint scent of stale coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air, a familiar companion in Amy's life.  The entire office, packed with young, ambitious faces, were quietly working, each hunched over their own digital landscapes, each battling their own demons reflected in the cold, clinical light.  Outside, the city roared, a chaotic symphony of honking cars and distant sirens, a stark contrast to the controlled chaos within the walls of Precision Numbers.
