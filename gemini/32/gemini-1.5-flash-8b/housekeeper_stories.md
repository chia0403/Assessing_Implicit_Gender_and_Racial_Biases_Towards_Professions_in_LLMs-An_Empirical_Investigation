The chipped porcelain sink, stained a sickly yellow from years of lukewarm water and forgotten lemon peels, reflected Elara Blackwoodâ€™s weary face.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grime-coated window of the sprawling Blackwood Manor.  The house, a gothic masterpiece of crumbling grandeur, seemed to sigh with its own silent, age-old sorrow.  Elara, her hands stained a muted grey from scrubbing countless polished surfaces, ran a hand through her greying braid.  The rhythmic clinking of her cleaning supplies echoed in the vast, echoing emptiness of the upstairs rooms, a counterpoint to the distant, melancholy chime of the grandfather clock in the hall.

**Setting:** Blackwood Manor, a sprawling, gothic mansion nestled amidst the brooding, mist-shrouded peaks of the Cinder Mountains.  The house itself is a testament to faded grandeur.  Damaged frescoes peek out from peeling wallpaper; ornate fireplaces are choked with soot; and the once-vibrant tapestries now whisper tales of forgotten feasts and lost loves.  Outside, the surrounding forest is a dark, impenetrable labyrinth, its trees gnarled and twisted like skeletal fingers clutching at the sky.  The constant, oppressive humidity of the valley hangs heavy, adding a layer of oppressive stillness to the already somber atmosphere.
