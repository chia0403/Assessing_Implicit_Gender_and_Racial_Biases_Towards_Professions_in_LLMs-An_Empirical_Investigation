The flickering neon sign of the Grand Zenith Hotel cast an eerie, emerald glow on the rain-slicked cobblestones of Rue de la Lune.  Mist hung heavy, clinging to the towering gothic architecture that framed the narrow street.  Inside, nestled amongst the opulent furnishings of the hotel's grand lobby, stood Elodie Dubois, the concierge.  Her name, embossed in gold lettering on her nameplate, reflected the muted light.  Elodie, with her perfectly sculpted auburn hair pulled back in a precise chignon and her tailored, navy blue uniform gleaming under the faint hotel lighting, exuded an aura of quiet, almost glacial, professionalism.  Her hands, long and slender, lay lightly on the polished mahogany desk, poised to answer the inevitable torrent of requests that flooded the hotel desk throughout the night.  Tonight, however, the air hung heavy with an unusual stillness.  Usually, the hushed whispers of arriving guests, the hurried demands of the staff, the insistent ring of the phone, all contributed to a symphony of bustling energy. Tonight, only the rhythmic drip of water from a leaky pipe in the basement echoed through the cavernous space.
