The flickering fluorescent lights of the emergency room hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the ceaseless symphony of beeping monitors and the ragged breaths of the patients.  Dr. Eleanor Vance, her name etched into the weariness of her perpetually tired eyes, stared at the X-ray.  A jagged fracture snaked across the young woman's femur, a stark white line against the shadowed bone.  The air, thick with the antiseptic smell of disinfectant and the metallic tang of blood, felt heavy, pressing down on her like a physical weight.  The clock on the wall ticked relentlessly, each second a hammer blow against the quiet desperation rising in her chest.

Setting:  The emergency room of St. Jude's Hospital in the sprawling, perpetually overcast city of Aethelgard. Rain hammered against the grimy windows, mirroring the relentless storm brewing within the walls of the sterile, yet somehow claustrophobic, room. The hospital itself, a grand Victorian structure long past its prime, seemed to hold its breath in anticipation of the next crisis.  The air, thick with the scent of old linoleum and stale coffee, carried whispers of countless past tragedies and hushed promises of impossible cures.  Aethelgard, a city built on the remnants of forgotten empires and shadowed by ancient legends, was a place where the boundaries between the mundane and the miraculous often blurred.
