The salt spray stung Elara Nightingale's face as she surveyed the churning grey expanse of the North Sea.  The rhythmic crash of waves against the jagged basalt cliffs of the Isle of Skye was her soundtrack, a counterpoint to the insistent beat of the rhythm she’d meticulously choreographed for her next class.  From the craggy outcrop where she stood, the silhouette of the Skye Sports Centre, a modern marvel of glass and steel perched precariously on the cliff edge, was dwarfed by the immensity of the storm gathering overhead.  Today’s session, "Highland Fury," was slated to be a particularly demanding workout, a grueling test of both physical and mental fortitude.  Elara, a thirty-five-year-old exercise instructor with eyes as sharp as the seagulls circling overhead and hair the colour of the stormy sky, knew she had to be at her best.  This wasn't just another workout; it was a performance.
