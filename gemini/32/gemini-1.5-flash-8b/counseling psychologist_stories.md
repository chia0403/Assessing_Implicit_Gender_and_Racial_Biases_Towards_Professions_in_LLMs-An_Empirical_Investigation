Rain lashed against the arched windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance’s office, a relentless drumming that mirrored the turmoil simmering within her.  The scent of damp earth and petrichor hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the sterile, almost clinical, aroma of lavender-scented disinfectant that usually permeated the space.  Her meticulously organized office, a sanctuary of calm in the chaos of her life, felt strangely… empty.  Empty except for the worn leather chair across from her desk, the one where she was about to face another soul wrestling with the demons of their past.  The faint glow of the lamplight cast long shadows that danced with the reflections of the rain, painting the room in a muted, melancholic hue.  Outside, the city of Veridian hummed with a rhythm she couldn't quite decipher, a symphony of sirens and distant shouts that seemed to mock the quiet desperation she felt. Eleanor, a counseling psychologist with ten years of experience navigating the complexities of human emotions, knew this was going to be a long session.
