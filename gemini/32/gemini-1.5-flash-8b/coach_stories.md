The biting wind whipped across the frozen expanse of Lake Geneva, stinging Amelia Hawthorne's cheeks and rattling the flimsy plastic of her water bottle.  Below, the ice, a fractured mirror reflecting the bruised purple twilight sky, hid the silent, slumbering waters of the lake.  Amelia, a woman sculpted from years of relentless training and the unforgiving glare of competitive sports, hunched deeper into her parka.  Her breath puffed out in white plumes against the frigid air.  Tonight, the whispers of the ice weren't about the coming storm, but about the upcoming national figure skating competition.  And they weren't pleasant.

Setting:  A desolate ice rink, the only illumination coming from a few strategically placed floodlights that cast long, skeletal shadows across the frozen lake.  A half-moon, a sliver of pale light, hung low in the inky sky, barely illuminating the distant snow-covered peaks of the Swiss Alps. The air, sharp with the scent of pine and the metallic tang of ice, hung heavy with the unspoken anxieties of an elite athlete and the heavy burden of expectations.
