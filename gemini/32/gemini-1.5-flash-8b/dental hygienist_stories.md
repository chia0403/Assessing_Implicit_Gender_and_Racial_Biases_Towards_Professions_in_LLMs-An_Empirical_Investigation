The fluorescent hum of the dental office, a symphony of slightly jarring white noise, was Amelia "Amy" Blackwood's constant companion.  It was a familiar lullaby, one that had soothed her anxieties and punctuated her days for the past seven years.  Today, however, the hum felt different.  A persistent, low thrumming, like a trapped hummingbird beating its wings against a glass cage.  The air hung thick with the metallic tang of fear, a scent Amy recognized as vividly as the distinct mint-tinged aroma of her own antiseptic mouthwash.

Setting:

Amy's office, Dr. Chen's Dental Clinic, was a pristine, if slightly sterile, space on the second floor of a bustling, renovated Victorian building in the heart of the city. Sunlight, filtered through grimy, ornate lace-covered windows, cast a sickly yellow glow on the polished stainless steel instruments and gleaming white dental chairs.  The worn wooden floors, remnants of the building's history, echoed with the rhythmic click-clack of Amy's footsteps as she moved through the waiting room, a space cluttered with oversized magazines, and the hushed anxieties of patients waiting their turns. A distinct, almost tangible tension hung over the entire practice, a feeling Amy hadn't experienced before.  The city noise – sirens, car horns, distant traffic – usually provided a comforting white noise, but today, it seemed amplified, more insistent.  A palpable unease permeated every corner of the room.  It was almost as if the city itself was holding its breath.
