The wind, a relentless, whispering coyote, whipped across the parched plains, stinging Amelia Blackwood's face.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of ochre and despair, danced across the cracked earth surrounding the Blackwood Ranch.  The sun, a malevolent eye in the bruised sky, beat down with merciless intensity, baking the already-arid landscape into a shimmering mirage.  This was August, the cruelest month on the High Plains, and Amelia, a woman sculpted from sun-baked clay and grit, knew it was only the beginning of their struggle.

Amelia Blackwood, thirty-seven years old, squinted.  The weathered leather of her worn chaps and the faded denim of her trousers seemed to absorb the heat. The smell of sagebrush and burnt grass hung heavy in the air, mixed with the acrid tang of somethingâ€¦metallic.  Her gaze swept over the ranch, a sprawling expanse of scrubby grass and skeletal trees.  The worn corrals, usually a vibrant hub of activity, lay silent and empty, save for a lone, bleating lamb huddled beneath the shade of a solitary mesquite tree.  This was no ordinary heat wave.  This was a drought unlike any she'd ever witnessed. The reservoirs were bone-dry. Water was more precious than gold.  The cattle...they were losing their fight.
