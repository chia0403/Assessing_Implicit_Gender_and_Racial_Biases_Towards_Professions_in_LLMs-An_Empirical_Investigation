The biting wind whipped at the eaves of the small, timber-framed cottage, rattling the panes of the single, dusty window.  Inside, Elias Thorne, a carpenter with calloused hands and eyes the colour of weathered oak, hunched over a workbench strewn with tools.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom, illuminating a half-finished wooden birdhouse, its intricate curves a testament to Elias's meticulous craft.  The scent of pine and linseed oil hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort in this isolated corner of the Whispering Woods.

The village of Oakhaven, nestled deep within the valley, was a patchwork of cobbled streets and smoke-stained chimneys.  Ancient oaks, their branches gnarled and twisted like skeletal fingers, framed the village like a protective embrace, their leaves rustling with a mournful symphony in the constant breeze.  Elias's cottage, perched on the edge of the woods, felt even more secluded, a solitary sentinel amidst the whispering trees.  It had stood for generations, its timber weathered and worn, a silent chronicle of the lives that had passed through Oakhaven.  The villagers spoke of Elias with hushed reverence, not for his wealth or status, but for the uncanny way he seemed to understand the language of wood.  He could coax stories from splinters and whispers of strength from the gnarled branches, a whispered secret known only to him and the ancient trees.
