The chipped paint of the Victorian banister, a faded rose-pink that whispered of a bygone era, caught the afternoon sun.  Dust motes danced in the golden light, swirling around Amelia Hawthorne, Interior Decorator, as she surveyed the scene.  This wasn't just another house; this was the Blackwood Manor, a sprawling, imposing residence with a history as intricate as the tangled vines that clawed at the crumbling facade.  Amelia, her tailored tweed jacket a stark contrast to the decaying grandeur, traced a delicate fingertip along the ornate wallpaper, its floral patterns now muted and faded by time.  The air, thick with the smell of mildew and forgotten memories, hung heavy in the stagnant afternoon.  The manor stood perched atop a windswept hill, overlooking a valley that shimmered with the late summer heat.  Golden wheat fields stretched out beneath, whispering in the gentle breeze, while in the distance, the emerald peaks of the Whisperwood Mountains painted a breathtaking backdrop to the scene.  Amelia knew this job would be unlike any she had ever tackled, one that would require not just design skills, but a delicate touch with the ghosts of the past.
