The aroma of rosemary, thyme, and a hint of something almost metallic hung heavy in the air of "The Copper Kettle," a bustling little bistro tucked away on a cobbled street in the heart of the sun-drenched Italian town of Matera.  Sunlight, filtering through the lace-curtained windows, painted dappled patterns across the polished wooden tables, illuminating the swirling steam rising from the simmering sauces.  A symphony of clinking silverware, hurried conversations, and the rhythmic clatter of Chef Antonio Rossi's nimble hands echoed through the small space, a constant, comforting hum.  Antonio, a man whose face was perpetually etched with the concentration of a sculptor shaping clay, meticulously plated a dish of perfectly seared scallops, a delicate ballet of flavour and colour.  Each scallop, nestled on a bed of saffron risotto, was a miniature masterpiece, a testament to his years of honing his craft.
