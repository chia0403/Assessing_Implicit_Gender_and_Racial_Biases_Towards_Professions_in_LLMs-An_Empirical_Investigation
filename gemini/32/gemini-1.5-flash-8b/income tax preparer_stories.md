The fluorescent lights of the "Tax & Triumphs" office hummed, a soundtrack to Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's meticulously organized chaos.  Stacks of tax forms, each a miniature mountain of paperwork, towered around her.  Empty coffee cups, like miniature volcanic craters, dotted the cluttered desk.

The scent of stale coffee and desperation mingled with the faint, sickly sweet perfume of the overly-enthusiastic air freshener. This was her life:  an oasis of organized spreadsheets and frustrated sighs, wedged between the demands of late-April tax season and the ever-present hum of her next deadline.  The year was 2024.
