The fluorescent hum of the "Wellspring Pharmacy" vibrated through Amelia Blackwood's worn, navy-blue scrubs.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight piercing the grime-coated window, illuminating a chaotic symphony of empty pill bottles, overflowing prescription pads, and towering stacks of medical journals.  Amelia, a pharmacist of twenty years standing, leaned over a mahogany counter, its surface etched with the faint imprints of countless fingertips, tracing the inscription of a handwritten prescription.  The air, thick with the scent of antiseptic and decaying flowers from the overflowing vase on the manager's desk, felt thick and heavy, a tangible weight pressing down on her shoulders.  The familiar, yet oppressive, atmosphere of the small, independent pharmacy was her world.  It was a world she knew intimately, a world about to unravel.

The pharmacy was situated in the heart of Oakhaven, a once-bustling town now struggling to retain its identity in the face of rapid suburban sprawl.  Brick buildings, their facades cracked and chipped like old, weathered skin, lined the narrow, tree-lined streets.  The rhythmic clang of a blacksmith's hammer drifted from a workshop down the street, a melancholic counterpoint to the quiet hum of the pharmacy's fluorescent lights.  Patches of overgrown ivy crept up the sides of the shops, whispering tales of a bygone era, while new, sterile housing developments marched onward, swallowing up the historic character of the town.  Amelia, though born and raised in Oakhaven, felt this insidious change acutely; a tangible, creeping shadow stealing the essence of what she knew.
