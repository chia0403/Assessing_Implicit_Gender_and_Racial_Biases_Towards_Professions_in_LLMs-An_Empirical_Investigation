The fluorescent lights of the brokerage, a sterile white cathedral of high-powered computers and nervous energy, buzzed above Amelia "Amy" Carmichael.  Her reflection, pale and strained, stared back from the polished chrome of the trading desk.  It was 3:17 AM, the graveyard shift of Wall Street.  The air, thick with the scent of stale coffee and impending doom, hung heavy in the room.  The ticker tape, a relentless, rhythmic whisper of numbers, was the only sound besides the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Amy's rapidly beating heart. Outside, the city slept, unaware of the seismic shifts happening inside the cavernous trading floor.

**Setting:**

Amy's office, located on the 32nd floor of the imposing, glass-and-steel skyscraper that housed "Apex Capital," was a monument to minimalist efficiency.  Rows upon rows of computer screens, bathed in the eerie green glow of stock tickers, dominated the space.  The high-backed chairs, hard and unforgiving, were scattered around sleek, polished desks. The faint hum of air conditioning and the constant whir of servers created a symphony of controlled chaos.  The only touch of warmth was the flickering candlelight on Amy's desk, casting long shadows that danced with the ticker tape's relentless pulse.  Rain hammered against the skyscraper's windows, a frantic counterpoint to the calculated moves being made within.
