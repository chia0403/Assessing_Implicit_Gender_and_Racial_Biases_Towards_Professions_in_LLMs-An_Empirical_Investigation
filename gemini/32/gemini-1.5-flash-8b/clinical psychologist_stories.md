Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  The city of Alderhaven, a sprawling metropolis nestled amongst the jagged peaks of the Veridian Mountains, was cloaked in a grey, oppressive gloom.  The rhythmic drumming of the rain on glass was a relentless soundtrack to the growing unease swirling within her.  Eleanor, a clinical psychologist specializing in trauma recovery, stared out at the cityscape, a phantom ache in her chest a constant reminder of the case that haunted her.  Her meticulously organized office, a haven of muted grays and calming greens, felt strangely sterile, a stark contrast to the raw emotion that throbbed beneath the surface.  Empty coffee cups lined the desk, testament to the late-night sessions, the countless hours spent trying to unravel the fragmented memories of her patient,  Elias Thorne.  The city lights, usually a dazzling spectacle, tonight felt like distant embers in a dying fire.  The case was complicated; Elias's account of the incident was fragmented, contradictory, and laced with impossibly vivid hallucinations that danced on the edge of reality.  Eleanor knew that somewhere deep within those fragmented pieces, the truth lay hidden, a truth that threatened to shatter everything she thought she knew.
