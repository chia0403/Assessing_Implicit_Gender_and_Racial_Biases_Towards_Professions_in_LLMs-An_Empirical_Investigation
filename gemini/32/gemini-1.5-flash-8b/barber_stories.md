The scent of sandalwood and something faintly metallic hung heavy in the air of the "Razor's Edge" barbershop.  Sunlight, fractured by the intricate latticework of the awning, painted shifting patterns on the worn linoleum floor.  Barnaby "Barty" Butterfield, a man whose silver hair, surprisingly, hadn't lost its luster, meticulously honed the edge of a gleaming straight razor.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of light piercing the gloom of the small shop, nestled between a bustling bakery and a perpetually overflowing secondhand bookstore.  Outside, the cacophony of a bustling London market day – the cries of hawkers, the clinking of coins, the rumble of carts – faded to a muted hum within the confines of the barbershop.  Barty, hunched over his work, was lost in the rhythmic pulse of the task, the rasp of steel against steel, the whisper of his own thoughts.
