The biting wind, a razor-sharp serpent, whipped across the exposed granite face of Mount Aethelred.  Dust, the colour of dried blood, swirled around Elara Stonehand, stinging her eyes and coating her calloused hands.  She hauled another block of the pale grey stone, its weight a familiar burden pressing against her muscles.  The sun, a pale disc battling the encroaching gloom, cast long, skeletal shadows across the vast quarry.  This was her world â€“ the unforgiving heart of the mountains, a place sculpted not by nature, but by the hands of men like hers, and the relentless rhythm of chisels on stone.  Elara Stonehand, daughter of Kael, lived a life as stark and unforgiving as the mountain itself.
