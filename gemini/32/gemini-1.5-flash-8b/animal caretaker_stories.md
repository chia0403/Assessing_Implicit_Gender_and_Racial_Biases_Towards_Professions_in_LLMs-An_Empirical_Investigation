The biting wind whipped Amelia "Poppy"  Petersen's scarf around her face, stinging her cheeks as she trudged down the gravel path towards the Blackwood Sanctuary.  Each gust carried with it the scent of pine and damp earth, a familiar aroma that soothed her even as it chilled her to the bone.  October in the Allegheny Mountains was a fickle mistress, and today she was on the receiving end of her capricious nature.  Poppy, Animal Caretaker at Blackwood Sanctuary, had been tasked with the delicate job of delivering a rare, hand-reared snow leopard cub named "Whisper" to the nearby mountain peak's newly constructed observation deck for the winter months.

The Blackwood Sanctuary, nestled deep within the whispering woods of the Allegheny, was a haven for rescued and rehabilitated wildlife.  Towering pines, their branches gnarled and twisted by centuries of wind and snow, formed a natural canopy over the sprawling grounds.  A network of winding paths, meticulously maintained despite the encroaching wilderness, led to enclosures housing everything from lumbering bears to skittish skinks, each species demanding a unique approach to care.  A rustic stone cottage, home to the sanctuary's staff, sat nestled beside a babbling brook, its warmth a stark contrast to the biting chill of the surrounding forest.  The air, thick with the earthy scent of decaying leaves and damp moss, held an almost palpable sense of peacefulness, a stark contrast to the frenetic energy of the outside world.
