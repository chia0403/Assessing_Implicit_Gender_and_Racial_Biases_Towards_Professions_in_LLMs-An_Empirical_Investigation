The fluorescent lights of the emergency room hummed, a relentless, almost sinister, counterpoint to the frantic whispers and the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of heart monitors.  Rain lashed against the windows of St. Judeâ€™s, blurring the already hazy city lights into a swirling, grey tapestry outside.  Inside, Amelia Hayes, RN, registered nurse and veteran of countless ER nights, stared at the young man sprawled on the gurney.  He was barely a teenager, pale and still, the faintest trace of a bruise blooming under his cheekbone.  His chest rose and fell with a ragged, shallow breath, each gasp a tiny, desperate plea in the suffocating symphony of the room.  Amelia's gloved hand hovered over his pulse, the rhythmic thump barely audible over the constant cacophony.  This wasn't just another night.  Something felt different, heavy, like a storm gathering on the horizon. This wasn't just another patient.  This was *his* night.
