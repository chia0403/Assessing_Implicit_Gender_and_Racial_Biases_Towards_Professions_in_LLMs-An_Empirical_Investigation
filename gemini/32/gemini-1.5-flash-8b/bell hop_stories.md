The humid air hung thick and heavy over the Grand Imperial Hotel, clinging to the polished mahogany furniture and the starched white linens like a second skin.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grand hall, illuminating a flurry of activity.  Luggage carts rattled and clattered, porters shouted directions in a language that sounded like a symphony of clipped vowels and guttural consonants, and the faint scent of lilies and stale cigarettes hung in the air.  This was the domain of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, bell hop extraordinaire, or at least that was his ambition.

Barty, a lanky young man with eyes the color of faded blueberries and a perpetually bewildered expression, meticulously polished the brass rim of a massive steamer trunk.  Sweat beaded on his forehead, despite the cool breeze from the open windows.  He was, by his own estimation, the most efficient bell hop in the world.  Today, however, efficiency was proving elusive.  He'd already misplaced a pair of opera glasses (and, inexplicably, a priceless antique snuff box), and the aroma of something suspiciously like burnt toast emanating from the adjoining suite had sent a ripple of panic through the hallways.
