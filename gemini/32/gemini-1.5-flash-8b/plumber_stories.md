The flickering neon sign of "Fix-It Freddie's Plumbing" cast a sickly yellow glow over the rain-slicked alley.  Water, in a constant, insistent drip, dripped from the rusted gutters, mirroring the relentless drumming of rain against the corrugated iron roofs.  This was the heart of the city's forgotten corners, a labyrinth of narrow streets and towering brick buildings, where the aroma of stale beer mingled with the pungent scent of damp earth.  Ten-year-old Leo, his nose pressed against a grimy window, watched the figures moving in the gloom.

Amelia "Amy" Nightingale, a young, ambitious plumber with a shock of fiery red hair and eyes that seemed to sparkle with practical solutions, slammed the battered toolbox shut.  The clang echoed through the alley, momentarily silencing the incessant rain.  Amy, Fix-It Freddie's star apprentice, adjusted the thick leather straps of her worn, but sturdy, work boots, her gaze scanning the gloom.  A desperate cry, sharp and punctuated, pierced the night.  It wasn't a cry of joy, but of a desperate need, a cry for help that carried the unmistakable tones of a flooded basement.
