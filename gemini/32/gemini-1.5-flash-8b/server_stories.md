The flickering neon sign of the "Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow over Amelia Petrova, illuminating the greasy smudges on her apron and the weariness etched into her young face.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless percussion that mirrored the steady drumbeat of the clattering dishes and the hushed murmur of conversations in the cramped, smoky tavern.
