The chipped paint of the Miss Emily Carterâ€™s classroom walls hummed with a quiet, almost tangible energy.  Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of afternoon sunlight piercing the grime-coated windowpane, illuminating a rainbow of dried glitter glue projects meticulously arranged on the shelves.  The air, thick with the faint scent of vanilla and old paper, held the lingering echoes of a particularly boisterous read-aloud session.  Eleven-year-old Amelia, with her unruly auburn curls and perpetually surprised expression, was now meticulously tracing the outline of a particularly intricate dragonfly.


The clock on the wall, a relic of a bygone era, ticked in a solemn, metronomic beat.  It was the last hour of Miss Emily Carter's fourth-grade class, a Thursday afternoon, and the air, usually buzzing with the low murmur of conversations and the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of pencils, was oddly still.  The only sound was the soft, measured rustling of paper as Miss Carter carefully filed away graded papers.
