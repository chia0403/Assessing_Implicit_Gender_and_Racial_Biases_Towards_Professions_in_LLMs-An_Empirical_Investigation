The scent of lavender and sandalwood hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the oppressive humidity of the Bangkok afternoon.  Sunlight, fractured into shimmering diamonds on the polished teak floor, illuminated dust motes dancing in the still air.  This was Anya Sharma's sanctuary, "The Lotus Blossom," a small, exquisitely decorated massage parlor tucked away on a side street near the bustling Chatuchak Weekend Market.  Anya, a woman with eyes the colour of jade and a smile that could melt glaciers, meticulously arranged the silk sheets on a massage table.  Her fingers, long and graceful, traced the intricate patterns woven into the fabric.  Today was a particularly quiet day, the usual symphony of low murmurs and gentle sighs replaced by an unnerving stillness. The soft chime of a distant temple bell was the only sound disrupting the almost unsettling peace.
