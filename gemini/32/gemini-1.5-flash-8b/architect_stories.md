The biting wind whipped Amelia Kensington's hair across her face, stinging her cheeks with icy rain.  She hunched deeper into the worn leather of her worn-out, but beloved, vintage motorcycle, the engine sputtering protestingly against the onslaught of the November storm.

Amelia, Architect of Neo-Veridia's famed Ascendant Spire district, was late.  Critically late.

The Ascendant Spire, a colossal, glass-and-steel edifice that pierced the perpetually overcast sky like a metallic spear, loomed before her, an imposing monument to human ingenuity and ambition.  This was no ordinary architectural project; this was a monument to the city's technological prowess, a symbol of its rapidly evolving society, and, more importantly, a symbol of Amelia's career.  Its skeletal framework, crafted from an alloy rumored to react with specific atmospheric conditions, was supposed to be completed by 10 PM. The city's future—as projected in the elaborate, intricate plans she'd spent countless nights poring over—depended on it.
