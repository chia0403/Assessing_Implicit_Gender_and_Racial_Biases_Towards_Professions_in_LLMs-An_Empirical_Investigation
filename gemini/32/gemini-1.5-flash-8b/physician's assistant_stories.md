The flickering fluorescent lights of the emergency room hummed a discordant symphony, a soundtrack to Amelia "Amy" Carter's frantic pace.  The sterile white walls seemed to absorb the frantic energy swirling around her, a stark contrast to the chaotic symphony of coughs, groans, and the rhythmic beep-beep of machines.  Amy, a physician's assistant at the bustling St. Jude's Community Hospital, felt a familiar knot tightening in her stomach.  Tonight, the city seemed to have unleashed its full collection of ailments upon them.  A shattered ankle, a suspected heart attack, a woman in labour â€“ the list stretched long and unpredictable, each patient demanding a different slice of her attention.  Outside, the city of Oakhaven, normally a symphony of car horns and chattering voices, was muffled, swallowed by the stillness of the pre-dawn hour.  The heavy, damp air hung thick and humid, promising a night of sticky discomfort for the patients battling various ills within the four walls of the ER.  Each new patient brought with it a fresh set of anxieties and a new narrative, and Amy, her brow furrowed in concentration, knew she had to remain steady, capable, and empathetic, while battling the exhaustion creeping into her bones.
