The biting wind whipped at Amelia "Amy" Sterling's flight jacket, stinging her cheeks and rattling the flimsy canopy of her small, single-engine biplane, the "Sky Wanderer."  Below, the emerald green valleys of the Appalachian Mountains, shrouded in a morning mist, looked like a patchwork quilt.  Amy, her brow furrowed in concentration, wrestled with the controls, the plane groaning under the strain of the headwind.  The rhythmic thrum of the engine was a constant companion, a lullaby punctuated by the occasional rasping cough.  Today was not going to be easy. The forecast was grim, and Amy knew the mountain passes were notoriously treacherous. This wasn't just a routine flight to deliver supplies to the isolated logging camp nestled high in the Smokies; this was a mission. A mission to find a lost prospector.

Setting: The Appalachian Mountains, spring 1938.  The air is crisp and damp, clinging to the ancient pines and cascading down the steep slopes.  The towering peaks, often shrouded in clouds, are tinged with the pale hues of dawn.  Patches of wildflowers dot the valleys, a stark contrast to the rugged terrain and the persistent chill in the air.  The logging camp, nestled in a secluded hollow, is a collection of weathered wooden shacks and dilapidated outbuildings, nestled amongst the trees.  The remote area is barely touched by civilization, with only the whisper of the wind and the distant call of a hawk to disturb the quiet.
