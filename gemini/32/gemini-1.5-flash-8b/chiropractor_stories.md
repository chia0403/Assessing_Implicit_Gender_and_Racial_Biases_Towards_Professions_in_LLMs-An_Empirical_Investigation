The rhythmic *click* of Dr. Amelia Hernandez's fingers against the adjustment table was the only sound in the small, sun-drenched office.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon light filtering through the tall, floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the bustling city street.  Amelia, a chiropractor with eyes the color of warm caramel, meticulously aligned the vertebra of a patient – a lanky young man with anxious eyes and a perpetually furrowed brow.  The scent of lavender, a calming aroma she'd chosen deliberately for her practice, mingled with the faint smell of old leather and the occasional whiff of antiseptic.  Amelia’s small, cluttered office, nestled in the heart of the vibrant, if somewhat chaotic,  Chinatown district of San Francisco, was a haven of quiet precision amidst the vibrant energy outside.  It was a sanctuary, a place where the aches and pains of daily life could be eased, one adjusted vertebra at a time.  Today, however, the quiet hum of her practice was disrupted by a sharp clang from outside, followed by a frantic knocking.
