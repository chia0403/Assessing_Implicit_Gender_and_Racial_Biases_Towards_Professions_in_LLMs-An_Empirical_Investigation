The wind, a rasping, icy hand, clawed at Bartholomew "Barty" Grimshaw's weathered face.  He braced himself against the precarious metal scaffolding, the biting wind threatening to rip him from the rooftop of the Grand Emporium.  Below, the city of Aethelgard shimmered in a thin veil of snow, its lights twinkling like scattered diamonds against a bruised twilight sky.  The Grand Emporium, once a beacon of glittering opulence, now stood gaunt and grey, its ornate facade shrouded in the silent misery of winter.  Barty, a roofer with calloused hands and eyes that held the grey of a November sky, felt a familiar tremor of anxiety, a premonition of the storm brewing far beneath the frosty roof tiles.  This job, this seemingly simple task of securing a loose shingle, felt more ominous, more weighty than usual.  The Emporium, he knew, held secrets older than the cobbled streets of Aethelgard, secrets whispered in the groaning timbers and the creaking eaves, and Barty was about to pry them open.
