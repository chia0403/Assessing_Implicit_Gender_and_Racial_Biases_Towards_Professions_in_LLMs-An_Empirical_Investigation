The fluorescent lights of the "Corner Grocer" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Blackwood's life.  Each beep of the scanner, each rustle of plastic bags, each impatient sigh from a customer, blended into a dull roar in her ears.  The tiny, beige-painted store, crammed with rows of canned goods and overflowing produce bins, felt like a miniature version of the world, trapped within a perpetual loop of transactions.  Amelia, her name a stark contrast to the muted surroundings, stood behind the counter, the chipped linoleum a cold comfort beneath her feet.  Today, the usual Tuesday morning rush was unusually absent, amplifying the hollow echo of the bell above the door.  The air hung heavy with the scent of stale bread and wilting lettuce, a perfume she knew intimately. This morning, it felt particularly oppressive, almost suffocating.
