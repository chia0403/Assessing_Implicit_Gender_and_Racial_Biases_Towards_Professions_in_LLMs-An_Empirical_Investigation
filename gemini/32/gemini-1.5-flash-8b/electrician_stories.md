The flickering fluorescent lights of the abandoned factory hummed a mournful dirge, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* of Amelia Hawthorne's boots on the cracked concrete floor.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of pale sunlight slicing through a gaping hole in the roof, illuminating jagged shards of broken glass and rusted machinery.  Amelia, her name a whispered echo in the cavernous space, expertly maneuvered a ladder, her movements precise and assured despite the encroaching gloom.  She was a master electrician, though not one to revel in the grandeur of her trade, preferring the quiet mastery of coaxing power from the shadows. This particular night, however, held a particular darkness. Not just the darkness of the factory itself, but a deeper, personal darkness that clung to her like the grime on the old transformers she was inspecting.  The factory, once a humming heart of industrial might, was now a skeleton of its former self, a testament to the relentless march of progress and the inevitable decay of ambition. This was her chosen domain, a realm of broken wires and forgotten dreams.
