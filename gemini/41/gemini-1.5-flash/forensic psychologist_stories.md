The biting November wind whipped at Dr. Eleanor Vance’s coat as she navigated the uneven cobblestones of the alleyway.  Rain, a relentless, icy drizzle, plastered her dark hair to her forehead, blurring the already dim gaslights into hazy halos.

The flickering light from a nearby pub cast long, distorted shadows, making the already claustrophobic alley seem even more menacing.  Eleanor, her breath misting in the cold air, pulled her collar tighter, the scent of blood – faint, but undeniably there – a grim prelude to the work that awaited her.
