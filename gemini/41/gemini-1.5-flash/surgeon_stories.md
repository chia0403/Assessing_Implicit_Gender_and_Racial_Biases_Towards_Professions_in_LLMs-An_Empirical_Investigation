The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Mia" Holloway's charcoal coat tighter around her as she hurried across the rain-slicked cobblestones of Edinburgh's Royal Mile.  The city, normally a breathtaking spectacle of ancient stone and gothic grandeur, was tonight cloaked in a grim, almost malevolent twilight.  Each gas lamp cast a feeble circle of light against the encroaching darkness, highlighting the relentless downpour and the grim, medieval architecture that loomed like brooding gargoyles.  Mia, however, barely noticed.  Her mind, as always when she was on call at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, was a surgical theatre of its own â€“ a precise, highly-focused space where only the next incision, the next suture, the next vital sign mattered. The emergency pager vibrated insistently against her hip, a staccato rhythm against the backdrop of the city's mournful moan.  Tonight, the city's shadows felt heavier than usual, mirroring the weight of the case that awaited her.
