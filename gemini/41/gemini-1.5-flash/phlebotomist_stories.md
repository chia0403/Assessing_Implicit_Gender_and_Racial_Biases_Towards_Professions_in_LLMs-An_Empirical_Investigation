The fluorescent lights of the Meadowbrook Medical Clinic hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the frantic rhythm of Amelia Hernandez’s heart.  Amelia, a phlebotomist whose days usually consisted of the comforting predictability of vein-hunting and bandage-applying, felt a tremor of unease crawl up her spine. The air, normally thick with the antiseptic scent of rubbing alcohol and faintly metallic tang of blood, was today heavy with something else – a strange, cloying sweetness that mingled unpleasantly with the lingering aroma of last night's spilled coffee.  Outside, the late October wind howled a mournful song against the rain-lashed windows of the clinic, rattling the already frayed nerves of the usually unflappable Amelia.  This wasn't just a busy Tuesday; something felt profoundly wrong.
