The dawn mist clung to the manicured lawns of Willow Creek Estates like a damp shroud, clinging to the dew-kissed blades of Bermuda grass and shrouding the extravagant mansions in an ethereal gloom.  Elias Thorne, his breath misting in the chilly October air, surveyed his domain with the practiced eye of a seasoned landscaper.  His worn leather work gloves, stained with the rich brown of topsoil and the vibrant green of countless clipped hedges, were already damp with the morning's humidity.  The air hummed with the quiet industry of the approaching day: the distant rumble of a garbage truck, the chirping of unseen birds, and the low thrum of Elias's own heartbeat, steady and strong like the oak trees lining the estate's perimeter.  Today, however, a different kind of stillness hung in the air, a foreboding quiet that even the relentless chirping couldn't quite dispel.  This was no ordinary landscaping job.
