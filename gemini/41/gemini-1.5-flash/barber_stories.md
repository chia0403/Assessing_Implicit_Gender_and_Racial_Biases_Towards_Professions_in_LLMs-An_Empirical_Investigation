The scent of Bay Rum and stale coffee hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Elias Thorne, owner and sole proprietor of Thorne's Tonsorial Parlour.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single, bare bulb swinging precariously above his worn barber's chair, danced in the afternoon sunlight slicing through the grimy windowpanes.  Outside, the relentless rhythm of the city – the screech of brakes, the rumble of distant trucks, the cacophony of a thousand hurried footsteps – faded to a muted hum within the confines of his small, cluttered shop.  Elias, a man whose face bore the map of a life lived honestly, though not always easily, ran a hand over his own thinning, salt-and-pepper hair, the familiar weight of his clippers a comforting presence in his calloused hand.  The only other sound was the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock in the corner, each chime a tiny hammer blow against the quiet expectancy of the afternoon.
