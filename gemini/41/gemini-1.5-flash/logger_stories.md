The biting wind, sharp as a fallen axe head, whipped across Elijah “Eli” Blackwood’s face, stinging his cheeks raw.  He hunched deeper into his worn sheepskin coat, the collar pulled high, offering scant protection against the relentless February gale that howled through the ancient Sitka spruce forest of the Tongass National Forest in Southeast Alaska.  Snow, heavy and wet, clung to the branches, bowing them low like supplicants before a vengeful god.  The air itself tasted of pine, damp earth, and the metallic tang of iron – the lingering scent of blood, though Eli couldn't place its source.  He gripped the handle of his trusty Stihl chainsaw, its familiar weight a comfort in the unforgiving wilderness.  This wasn't just a job; it was a communion, a wrestling match with nature itself, and tonight, nature was winning.
