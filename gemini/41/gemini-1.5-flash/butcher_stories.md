The rasp of steel on bone, a sound as familiar to Bartholomew "Barty" Butchers as his own heartbeat, echoed through the chill air of his shop.  Barty's Butchery, a squat, timber-framed building clinging to the edge of Oakhaven, smelled of sawdust, blood, and the subtle sweetness of rendered fat â€“ a scent that had permeated Barty's very being over the thirty-odd years he'd spent wielding his cleaver within its walls.  The morning mist clung to the cobblestones of the narrow street outside, obscuring the grim, grey rooftops beyond, and a thin layer of frost still clung to the butcher's block where Barty was meticulously trimming a leg of mutton, his movements as precise and practiced as a surgeon's. The only sounds, apart from the rhythmic scrape of his knife, were the distant clang of the blacksmith's hammer and the mournful caw of a lone crow perched precariously on the weather vane above.
