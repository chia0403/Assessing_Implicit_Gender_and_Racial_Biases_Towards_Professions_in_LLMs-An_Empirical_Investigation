The chipped paint of Elias Thorne’s writing desk flaked onto the manuscript like a persistent snowfall.  Elias, a man whose beard rivaled the unruly tangle of his thoughts, hunched over his work, the flickering gaslight casting long, skeletal shadows across the cramped attic room. Rain lashed against the single, grime-streaked windowpane, mirroring the tempest brewing within him.  Dust motes danced in the weak illumination, each a tiny, ephemeral ghost in the oppressive silence of the converted stable, a silence broken only by the rhythmic scratching of his pen and the mournful sigh of the wind whistling through gaps in the aged wood.  The air hung thick with the scent of old paper, damp earth, and the lingering aroma of pipe tobacco – a comforting blend that did little to soothe the gnawing anxiety clawing at his already frayed nerves.  This was his sanctuary, his prison, his attic; and tonight, it felt more like the latter two.
