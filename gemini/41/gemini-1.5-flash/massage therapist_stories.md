The scent of lavender and sandalwood hung heavy in the air, a comforting balm against the relentless November drizzle lashing against the leaded-glass windows of Serenity Spa.  Rain hammered a relentless tattoo on the slate roof, a counterpoint to the quiet hum of the aromatherapy diffuser and the soft, rhythmic sighs emanating from Room 3.  Inside, Amelia Katherine Davies, a massage therapist with hands as deft as a surgeon's and a heart as warm as a summer afternoon, kneaded the tense muscles of her latest client.  The dim, amber light cast long shadows across the polished wooden floor, highlighting the dust motes dancing in the air like tiny, glittering stars.  Outside, the world was a muted grey, but within the sanctuary of Serenity Spa, Amelia wove a different kind of magic, one that eased pain and soothed troubled souls.
