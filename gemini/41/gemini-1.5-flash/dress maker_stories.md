The scent of lavender and old silk hung heavy in the air, a comforting cloud clinging to the dusty velvet curtains of Esme’s Atelier.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the grimy windowpane, danced in the quiet space.  Esmeralda "Esme" Moreau, her fingers stained a delicate purple from the dye she’d been working with earlier, meticulously stitched a tiny pearl onto the delicate lace trim of a wedding gown.  The atelier itself, tucked away on a cobbled side street in the ancient, labyrinthine city of Prague, was a chaotic symphony of fabrics: bolts of shimmering satin, rolls of crisp linen, and stacks of patterned silks tumbled from overflowing shelves and draped across worn wooden tables.  A half-finished flamenco dress in fiery red and black lay abandoned on a mannequin, its ruffled sleeves seeming to writhe in protest at its unfinished state.  Outside, the sounds of the city – the distant rumble of trams, the chatter of passersby, the melancholic strains of an accordion – were muted by the thick stone walls, leaving only the gentle rhythm of Esme's needle and the soft whisper of the fabric as her quiet, focused work continued.
