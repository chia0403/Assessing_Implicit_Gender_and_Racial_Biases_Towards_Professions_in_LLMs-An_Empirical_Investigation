The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne's dark hair across her face as she hurried down the rain-slicked cobblestones of Charleston's French Quarter.  The scent of jasmine, usually a comforting balm, was overwhelmed tonight by the sharp tang of salt spray and something else… something metallic, faintly sickening.  Gas lamps flickered, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to writhe like phantoms against the ancient brick buildings. Rain hammered against the wrought-iron balconies, a relentless percussion accompanying the frantic beat of Amelia's heart.  She pulled her worn leather satchel tighter, its contents – a battered stethoscope, a well-worn copy of *Gray's Anatomy*, and a half-eaten granola bar – offering little comfort against the growing unease that clung to her like the damp night air.  Tonight, the usual charm of her beloved Charleston felt… wrong.  Deeply, unsettlingly wrong.
