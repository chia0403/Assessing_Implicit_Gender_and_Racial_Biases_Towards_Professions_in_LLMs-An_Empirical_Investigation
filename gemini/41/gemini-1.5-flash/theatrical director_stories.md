The stale scent of sawdust and forgotten dreams clung to the air of the Blackwood Theatre, a relic of a bygone era clinging precariously to life on the crumbling edge of the cobbled streets of Prague.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single, flickering bulb hanging above, danced in the shafts of light that pierced the gloom.  Amelia Katherine Petrova, a woman whose sharp eyes belied the weariness etched into her face, ran a hand over the worn velvet curtain, the fabric cool and slightly damp beneath her touch.  The theatre, her theatre, felt less like a place of vibrant performance and more like a mausoleum â€“ a monument to ambitions deferred and battles lost.  Tonight, however, felt different. Tonight, the air thrummed with a nervous energy that even the pervasive scent of decay couldn't quite mask.  The whispers, barely audible over the rhythmic drip of a leaky pipe, promised a resurrection.
