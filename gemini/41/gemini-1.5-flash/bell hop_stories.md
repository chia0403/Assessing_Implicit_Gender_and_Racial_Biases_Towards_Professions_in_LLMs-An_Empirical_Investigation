The brass spittoon gleamed under the sickly yellow light of the Crystal Palace Hotel lobby, reflecting the nervous sheen on seventeen-year-old Finley "Finn" O'Malley's forehead.  Finn, whose starched white uniform felt more like a straightjacket than a symbol of his burgeoning profession, adjusted the overflowing luggage cart with a grunt.  The air hung thick with the cloying scent of lilies, expensive cigars, and desperation – the usual perfume of the Crystal Palace, a once-grand establishment clinging precariously to its faded glory in the shadow of the booming new skyscrapers of 1920s Chicago.  Rain lashed against the enormous arched windows, mirroring the storm brewing inside Finn himself.  He’d overheard snippets of hushed conversations earlier – whispers of gambling debts, secret rendezvous, and even something about…murder.  Tonight, however, felt different, heavier than the usual baggage he carted for the hotel's tempestuous clientele.  Tonight, Finn felt like he was carrying the weight of the city itself.
