The rasping whine of the asphalt cutter sliced through the pre-dawn stillness, a metallic shriek swallowed almost instantly by the roar of approaching semi-trucks on I-40.  Dust motes, disturbed by the machine's vibrations, danced in the weak, orange glow of the rising sun.  Elias Thorne, his face grimy with sweat and tar, adjusted the earmuffs protecting him from the incessant noise.  He wiped a hand across his brow, leaving a dark streak against the already sun-baked skin.  The air, thick with the smell of hot bitumen and exhaust fumes, hung heavy and still in the Arizona desert.  The relentless sun promised another brutal day on the unforgiving stretch of highway between Flagstaff and Winslow, a landscape as vast and unforgiving as Elias himself.
