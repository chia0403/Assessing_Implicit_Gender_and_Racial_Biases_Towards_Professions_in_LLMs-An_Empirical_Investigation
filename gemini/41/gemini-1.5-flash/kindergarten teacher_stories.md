The aroma of dried paint and slightly burnt toast hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Ms. Eleanor Vance.  Sunlight, fractured by the stained-glass window depicting a rather startled-looking lamb, dappled the worn wooden floor of her kindergarten classroom.  Crayon shavings, like confetti from a particularly vibrant party, littered the edges of the small, brightly colored tables.  Outside, the playground equipment – a rusty slide, a wobbly climbing frame, and a sandpit currently occupied by a family of determined ants – waited patiently for the excited shrieks and delighted squeals of its usual occupants.  This Tuesday morning, however, was unusually quiet.  Too quiet.  A silence so profound it felt almost… ominous.
