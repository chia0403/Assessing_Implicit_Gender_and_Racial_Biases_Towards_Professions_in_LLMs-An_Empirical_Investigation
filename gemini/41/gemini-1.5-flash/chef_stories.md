The salt spray kissed Chef Isabella “Izzy” Rossi’s face as she wrestled the recalcitrant fishing net onto the deck of the *La Sirena*.  The late afternoon sun, a bruised plum against the churning turquoise of the Ligurian Sea, cast long shadows across the boat, highlighting the frantic scurry of her crew.  The air, thick with the scent of brine and diesel, was punctuated by the cries of gulls and the rhythmic slap of waves against the hull.  Portofino, a jewel-toned cluster of pastel buildings clinging to the cliffs, shimmered in the distance, a promise of warmth and the comforting aroma of basil and garlic that was as much a part of Izzy's life as the sea itself.  But tonight, the focus was solely on the catch: a haul of glistening, silvery sardines, crucial for her ambitious menu at "Stella Maris," the renowned seaside restaurant she'd inherited from her Nonna.  The success – or failure – of her latest culinary creation, a daring reimagining of classic Ligurian cuisine, rested entirely on these tiny, wriggling fish.
