He tugged his worn, orange hard hat lower, the faded logo of "Thorne & Sons Construction" barely visible beneath the grime.

Elias, his breath misting in the frigid air, hefted his sledgehammer, the familiar weight a comforting presence in the growing darkness.  Tonight, like every other night this week, finishing the north wing was his battle.  And the wind, it seemed, was his most formidable opponent.
