The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of Xylos, carrying with it the scent of salt and something else… something acrid, metallic, that clung to the back of Sergeant Valerius Thorne’s throat.  He pulled his worn, grey wool cloak tighter, the rough fabric scratching against his chainmail.  The sun, a weak, watery disc hanging low in the bruised purple sky, offered little warmth.  Xylos was a land of harsh beauty, a landscape sculpted by centuries of wind and war, its few meager settlements clinging precariously to the edges of the vast, unforgiving expanse.  Valerius, his breath misting in the frigid air, stood guard at the crumbling remains of the Old Watchtower, its once-proud stones now fractured and stained with the grim history of the borderlands.  The flickering lamplight in his hand cast long, dancing shadows that seemed to writhe with an unnerving life of their own.  He squinted, his gaze sweeping the horizon, searching for any sign of movement in the gathering dusk.  Tonight, the silence felt heavier than usual, pregnant with a foreboding that chilled him to the bone.
