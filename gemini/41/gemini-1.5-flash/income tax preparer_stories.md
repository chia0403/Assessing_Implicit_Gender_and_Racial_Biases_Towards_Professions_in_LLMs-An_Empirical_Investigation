The air smelled faintly of stale coffee and desperation â€“ a familiar aroma in the weeks leading up to the tax deadline.  Bea, her auburn hair pulled back in a tight bun, rubbed her tired eyes, the faint scent of peppermint from her hand lotion doing little to combat the pervasive scent of impending doom.
