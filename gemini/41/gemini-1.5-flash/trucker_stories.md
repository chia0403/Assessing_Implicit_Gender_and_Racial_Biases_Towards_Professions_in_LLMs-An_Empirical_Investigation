The biting Montana wind howled a mournful dirge around Jedediah "Jed" Stone's rig, a symphony of ice cracking against metal and the groan of the aging eighteen-wheeler.  He sat hunched in the cab of his trusty Kenworth, "The Wanderer," its chrome gleaming faintly under a bruised, pre-dawn sky.  The air inside, despite the powerful heater battling the arctic blast, held a thin film of diesel fumes and the lingering scent of stale coffee, a familiar aroma that clung to Jed like a second skin after twenty years on the road.  Outside, the snow piled high against the guardrails of the desolate Interstate 90, the landscape a stark, unforgiving canvas of white against a bruised purple horizon.  The only other visible sign of life was a lone, wind-battered pine clinging precariously to the edge of a snow-covered embankment, its branches twisted into the shape of a desperate plea. Jed checked his CB radio, the static crackle a counterpoint to the wind's lament.  Another long haul ahead, another lonely stretch of road under a sky that threatened more than just snow.
