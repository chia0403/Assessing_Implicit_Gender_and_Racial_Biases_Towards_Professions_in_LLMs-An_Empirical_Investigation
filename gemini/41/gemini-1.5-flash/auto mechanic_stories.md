The greasy scent of motor oil clung to Amelia "Amy" Hernandez like a second skin.  It mingled with the acrid tang of burnt coffee brewing on the ancient, sputtering pot in the corner of her workshop – Hernandez's Auto Repair, a single-bay garage squeezed between a laundromat perpetually smelling of bleach and a perpetually-empty storefront promising "Exotic Dance Lessons" – a promise, Amy suspected, as empty as the storefront itself.  Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof, a relentless percussion accompanying the rhythmic thud of Amy's wrench against a stubborn bolt on a vintage Mustang's engine.  The air hung thick with the humidity of a Louisiana summer, further amplified by the heat radiating from the engine, turning the small, cluttered space into a personal sauna.
