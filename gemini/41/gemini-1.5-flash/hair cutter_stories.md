The scent of rosemary and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Aurelia “Relia”  Montclair.  Relia, owner and sole proprietor of "The Snip & Sip," perched on a worn, velvet-upholstered stool behind her antique barber's chair, the afternoon sun slanting through the large, dusty window of her tiny salon.  Dust motes danced in the golden light, illuminating the chipped paint on the walls, a testament to years of laughter, tears, and countless transformations.  Outside, the cobblestones of  Charleston’s French Quarter shimmered with heat, the rhythmic clang of the horse-drawn carriages a counterpoint to the gentle hum of the old rotary phone on the counter.  Relia, her own auburn hair braided intricately down her back, sighed contentedly.  Another sweltering Charleston summer day was unfolding, and with it, the promise of another day of stories woven amongst the snips and suds.
