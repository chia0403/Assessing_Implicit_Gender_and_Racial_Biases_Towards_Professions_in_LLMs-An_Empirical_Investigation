The scent of rosemary and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a peculiar perfume only Aurelia “Rella” Marigold could conjure.  Rella, owner and sole stylist of "Shear Bliss" salon, perched precariously on a rolling stool, her nimble fingers weaving through a cascade of fiery red hair.  The salon itself was a charming anachronism, tucked away on a cobbled side street in the ancient, slightly crumbling town of Port Blossom.  Sunlight, filtered through dusty lace curtains, dappled the worn wooden floorboards, illuminating the chipped porcelain sinks and the eclectic collection of vintage hair dryers that lined the walls like silent, metallic sentinels.  Outside, the rhythmic crash of waves against the harbour wall provided a constant, soothing soundtrack to the snip-snip-snip of Rella's shears.  Today, however, the usual tranquility was shattered by a storm brewing not in the sky, but in the heart of her latest client.
