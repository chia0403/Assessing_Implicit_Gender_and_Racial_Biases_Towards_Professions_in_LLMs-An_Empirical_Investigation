The flickering neon sign of "Joe's All-Nighter Diner" cast a sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked streets of Oakhaven, reflecting in the puddles that mirrored the city's weary sigh.  Steam rose from the cracked pavement, mingling with the exhaust fumes of a sputtering taxi and the damp chill that clung to everything.  Inside the diner, the aroma of stale coffee and greasy bacon fought a losing battle against the persistent scent of sewage.  This was precisely where Archibald "Archie" Bartholomew Finch, master plumber and reluctant hero of countless clogged drains, found himself at 3:17 AM, nursing a lukewarm cup of coffee and staring morosely at a half-eaten plate of hash browns.  His wrench, usually a comforting weight in his worn tool bag, felt unusually heavy tonight.  The silence, broken only by the rhythmic clatter of cutlery and the low hum of the refrigerator, was oppressive.  Something was rotten in Oakhaven, and Archie, with his trusty plunger and a growing sense of unease, suspected he was about to find out just how rotten.
