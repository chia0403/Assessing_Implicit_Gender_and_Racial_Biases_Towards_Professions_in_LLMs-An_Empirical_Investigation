The biting November wind whipped Amelia Rosaline Blackwood’s hair across her face, stinging her cheeks a vibrant, unwelcome crimson that clashed horribly with the muted greys and browns of the Cornish coastline.  She tugged her thick wool scarf tighter, the rough fabric scratching against her chapped lips.  The slate-grey sea churned restlessly below the crumbling cliffs, a symphony of crashing waves providing a relentless, melancholic soundtrack to her solitary vigil.  Amelia, renowned for her dramatic seascapes that captured the raw, untamed spirit of the ocean, found herself strangely uninspired.  Her easel, perched precariously on a windswept outcrop, remained stubbornly bare, a stark canvas mocking her artistic block.  The usually vibrant palette at her feet lay untouched, a collection of muted pigments mirroring the greyness of the day and the hollowness in her heart.  This particular stretch of coast, known locally as Widow’s Walk, held a particular significance for her, a haunting beauty that usually ignited her creative fire, but today, it offered only a bleak reflection of her own inner turmoil.
