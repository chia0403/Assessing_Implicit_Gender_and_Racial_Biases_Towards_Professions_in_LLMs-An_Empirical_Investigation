The rasp of Elias Thorne's plane sang a mournful tune, a counterpoint to the mournful cry of gulls wheeling overhead.  Salt spray, carried on a brisk October wind, stung Elias's face as he worked, the scent mingling with the sharp, resinous aroma of the cedar he was shaping.  He stood perched precariously on a scaffold, a hundred feet above the churning grey waters of the Atlantic, the wind threatening to snatch his tools from his calloused hands.  Below him, the skeletal frame of the lighthouse, its once proud white paint now flaking and scarred, clawed at the sky.  This wasn't some grand, new construction; this was a restoration, a desperate fight against the relentless erosion of time and sea.  The island of Aisling, a lonely sentinel a day's sail from the mainland, was Elias's workplace, and its weathered beauty, both its charm and its curse.
