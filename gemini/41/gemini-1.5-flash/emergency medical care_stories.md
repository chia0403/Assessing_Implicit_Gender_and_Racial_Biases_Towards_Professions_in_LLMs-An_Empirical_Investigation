The biting November wind howled a mournful tune across the desolate expanse of the salt marshes, whipping Amelia “Mia” Hernandez’s already damp hair across her face.  The rhythmic slap of the waves against the mudflats provided a counterpoint to the frantic beat of her own heart.  Mia, a seasoned Emergency Medical Technician with the Coastal County EMS, gripped the steering wheel of the battered, four-wheel-drive ambulance, its siren wailing a desperate plea against the elemental roar.  The salt spray, thick and stinging, obscured the already fading light, painting the world in shades of grey and gunmetal.  Ahead, barely visible through the swirling mist, lay the skeletal remains of the old Coast Guard lookout tower, a lonely sentinel against the encroaching darkness and the impending storm.  This was where the call had originated – a single, garbled transmission, crackling with static and the desperate rasp of a man's voice.  The only clue: "…injured…marsh…need help…"  Mia's knuckles were white as she wrestled the ambulance through the treacherous, rutted track, each jarring bump a reminder of the urgency of the situation.  The life, or death, of a stranger hung in the balance, swallowed by the unforgiving maw of the encroaching night.
