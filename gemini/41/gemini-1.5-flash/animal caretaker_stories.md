The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Amy” Hawthorne’s hair across her face as she wrestled a recalcitrant bale of hay.  The scent of damp earth and pine needles, usually comforting, was overwhelmed tonight by the acrid tang of woodsmoke clinging stubbornly to the air.  Amy, her breath puffing out in white clouds, glared at the stubborn bale, its twine stubbornly resisting her efforts.  Around her, the sprawling grounds of Blackwood Manor – a rambling Victorian gothic monstrosity perched precariously on a cliff overlooking the churning grey sea – were shrouded in an almost supernatural gloom.  The ancient oaks that ringed the property clawed at the darkening sky like skeletal fingers, their branches groaning under the weight of the relentless wind.  Tonight, the manor seemed less a stately home and more a brooding, watchful beast, its many windows like vacant eyes staring out at the tempestuous night.  Amy, however, was far too preoccupied with the hay to be concerned with the gothic atmosphere.  She had a menagerie of creatures to feed, and a deadline to meet.
