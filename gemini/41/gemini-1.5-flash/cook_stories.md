The air hung thick and sweet, a cloying blend of cardamom, saffron, and simmering lamb, clinging to Amelia Katherine Finch like a second skin.

The low, sun-drenched space pulsed with a life of its own â€“ a riot of colours, from the vibrant silks draped over worn wooden shelves laden with exotic spices to the terracotta tiles underfoot, perpetually slick with spilled oil and hurried footsteps.  Outside, the call to prayer echoed, a melodic counterpoint to the rhythmic clang of Amy's knives, a sound as familiar to her as her own heartbeat.
