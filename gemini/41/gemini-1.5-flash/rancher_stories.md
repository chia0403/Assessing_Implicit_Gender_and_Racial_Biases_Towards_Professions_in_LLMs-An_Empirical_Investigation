The air, thin and crisp at this altitude in the Colorado Rockies, carried the scent of pine needles, frozen earth, and something else – something acrid, unsettling, that prickled the hairs on the back of his neck.  It smelled like…trouble.  The vast, snow-covered expanse of his ranch, usually a source of quiet pride, felt suddenly vulnerable, exposed under the unforgiving gaze of the winter sky.
