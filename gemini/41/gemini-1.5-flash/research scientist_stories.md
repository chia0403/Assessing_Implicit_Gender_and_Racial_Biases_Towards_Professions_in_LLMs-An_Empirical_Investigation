The biting Antarctic wind howled a mournful symphony around Dr. Evelyn Hayes, its icy fingers clawing at the exposed skin of her face.  She pulled her thermal balaclava tighter, the breath fogging momentarily before being snatched away by the relentless gale.  The research station, a squat, metallic behemoth clinging precariously to the ice shelf, groaned under the pressure of the wind and the shifting ice.  Inside, the warmth was a deceptive comfort, a fragile bubble of civilization against the brutal, unforgiving wilderness that stretched to the horizon – a wilderness Evelyn Hayes had dedicated her life to understanding.  The biting wind carried with it the scent of ozone and the faint, metallic tang of something else… something unsettling, something that sent a prickle of unease down her spine despite the layers of thermal protection. Tonight, the familiar Antarctic night felt different. Tonight, something was wrong.
