The chipped Formica tabletop vibrated faintly under the weight of Amelia Grace Hawthorneâ€™s forearm, the tremor mimicking the low hum of the ancient refrigerator struggling to keep pace with the midday rush at the Rusty Mug Diner.  Sunlight, fractured by the grimy windowpanes, painted uneven stripes across the linoleum floor, highlighting the scattered crumbs and the sticky residue of spilled coffee.  The air hung thick with the scent of frying bacon, burnt coffee, and a faint, underlying sweetness Amelia suspected was the result of the waitress-turned-cook, Brenda, experimenting with a new pancake recipe (one that involved copious amounts of brown sugar and a suspicious amount of something resembling motor oil).  Amelia, her nametag slightly askew, sighed, the weight of another overflowing tray threatening to send her already precarious balance into a disastrous cascade of plates. This was, without a doubt, going to be another one of *those* days.
