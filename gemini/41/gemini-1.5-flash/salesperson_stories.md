The humid Louisiana air hung thick and heavy, clinging to Elias Thorne like a second skin.  Cicadas buzzed a relentless, almost maddening chorus from the oak trees lining the cracked asphalt driveway of Maison Dupré, a sprawling antebellum mansion that seemed to sigh under the weight of its own history. Elias, his crisp white shirt already damp with perspiration, adjusted his tie for the tenth time in as many minutes.  He wiped his brow with a handkerchief embroidered with his initials – E.T. – a small, almost pathetically optimistic flourish against the daunting task ahead.  He was Elias Thorne, senior account executive for Southern Comfort Sales, and today, he was selling more than just air conditioning units; he was selling hope.  Hope to Mrs. Evangeline Dupré, a woman whose family had owned this plantation for generations, a woman whose stubborn resistance to modern conveniences was as legendary as the crumbling grandeur surrounding him.
