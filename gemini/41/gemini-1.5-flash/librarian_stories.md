The scent of aged paper and leather hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the November chill seeping through the single-paned windows of the Hazelwood Public Library.  Rain lashed against the glass, a rhythmic drumming that underscored the quiet hum of activity within.  Dust motes, illuminated by the warm glow of the reading lamps, danced in the shafts of light that sliced through the gloom.  Eleanor Vance, a woman whose life had been as meticulously cataloged and organized as the very books she oversaw, sat at her oak desk, a half-finished cup of chamomile tea growing cold beside a stack of overdue notices.  The library, usually a sanctuary of calm, felt tonight like a pressure cooker, the quiet punctuated by the frantic scratching of a pen and the occasional, almost imperceptible, shiver that ran down Eleanor's spine.  Something feltâ€¦off.
