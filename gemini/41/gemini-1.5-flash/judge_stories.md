The chipped paint of Judge Amelia “Amy” Hawthorne’s chambers reflected the weak November sunlight slanting through the grimy windowpanes.  Dust motes, disturbed by the faintest tremor in the ancient building, danced in the amber beams.  The air, thick with the scent of aged leather and forgotten paperwork, hung heavy and still.  Outside, the relentless drizzle of a Seattle autumn hammered against the courthouse’s granite façade, a steady, melancholic percussion to the quiet hum of the city beyond.  Inside, Amy Hawthorne, her face etched with the weariness of a thousand difficult cases, stared at the photograph on her desk – a smiling woman with bright, mischievous eyes, her arm slung around a younger Amy.  The photograph, faded and creased from years of handling, was a stark contrast to the cold, formal reality of her surroundings, a reminder of a life lived far beyond the confines of this austere, echoing room.  Today, however, that life felt impossibly distant, overshadowed by the weight of the impending trial, a case that threatened to unravel not just the defendant's future, but possibly her own carefully constructed sense of justice.
