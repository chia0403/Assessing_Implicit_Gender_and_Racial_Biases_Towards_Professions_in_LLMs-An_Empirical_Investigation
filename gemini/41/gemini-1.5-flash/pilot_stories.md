The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful symphony around Captain Evelyn "Evie" Reed's weathered Cessna 185, its aluminum skin groaning under the strain of the relentless gusts.  Below, the Chugach Mountains clawed at the bruised twilight sky, their jagged peaks dusted with the first snowfall of the season.  The air, thin and crisp, tasted of pine and impending winter, a stark contrast to the humid, tropical air Evie was accustomed to from her previous posting in the Caribbean. This remote corner of Prince William Sound, however, felt like home. Or at least, as close to home as a woman who'd spent more time in the air than on the ground could ever hope to feel.  The radio crackled to life, a jarring intrusion into the otherwise silent majesty of the landscape, announcing a distress call from a fishing vessel trapped in a rapidly forming ice floe.  Evie gripped the yoke, her knuckles white against the worn leather.  This was precisely why she was here.
