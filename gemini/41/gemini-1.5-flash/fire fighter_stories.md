The acrid bite of smoke, thick and greasy with the scent of burning plastic and something sickeningly sweet, clawed at Captain Evelyn "Evie" Reed's throat.  She coughed, the sound swallowed by the roar of the inferno consuming the old textile mill on the edge of Oakhaven.  Flames, a malevolent orange tide, licked at the crumbling brick walls, spitting sparks that danced like angry fireflies against the bruised purple of the twilight sky.  The air vibrated with a chaotic symphony of crackling fire, groaning timber, and the frantic shouts of her crew battling the blaze from precarious positions on the collapsing roof.  Oakhaven, a town clinging stubbornly to its fading industrial past, was once again paying the price.
