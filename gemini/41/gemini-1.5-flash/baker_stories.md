The pre-dawn chill bit at Elara Thistlewick’s cheeks as she unlocked the bakery doors, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clinging to the crisp morning air.  Elara, a woman whose flour-dusted apron was as familiar to her as her own skin, pushed open the heavy oak door to "The Gilded Crumb," its name etched proudly above the frosted glass window.  Inside, the air was thick with the comforting aroma of yeast and simmering spices – a symphony of cinnamon, cardamom, and a hint of something secretly delicious only Elara knew the recipe for.  The gaslights hummed a low, sleepy tune, casting long shadows across the rows of empty bread racks, waiting to be filled with the fruits of her labor.  Outside, the cobbled streets of the ancient town of Oakhaven were still shrouded in slumber, the only sound the distant caw of a crow perched high on the spire of St. Jude's church.  But within the warm embrace of The Gilded Crumb, a new day was already baking.
