The wind, a rasping granite hand, clawed at Elias Thorne's weathered coat as he surveyed the quarry.  Dawn painted the eastern sky in bruised purples and fiery oranges, reflecting in the wet, glistening surfaces of the unfinished monoliths.  Elias, a man carved by the same relentless forces as the stone he shaped, squinted against the rising sun.  His calloused fingers, stained ochre and grey from years of working the earth, tightened around the worn leather handle of his hammer.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and pulverized rock, hung heavy with the promise of another backbreaking day at the Greystone Quarry, a place as unforgiving as the harsh, unforgiving life it had provided him.  The quarry itself, a gaping maw in the side of a windswept mountain, seemed to exhale a sigh of ancient dust with every gust, a testament to centuries of patient, relentless carving by both nature and man.
