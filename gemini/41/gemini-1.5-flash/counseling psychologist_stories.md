The chipped paint of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office window reflected the bruised purple of the late afternoon sky, mirroring the stormy mood brewing inside her.  Rain lashed against the glass, a rhythmic counterpoint to the frantic tapping of her pen against her notepad.  Her small, book-lined office, tucked away on the third floor of a rambling Victorian building in the heart of San Francisco's Castro district, usually hummed with a quiet, comforting energy.  Today, however, it felt claustrophobic, the air thick with unspoken anxieties.  The scent of jasmine from the overflowing planter on her windowsill was almost lost in the damp, earthy aroma of the approaching storm, an olfactory reflection of the emotional tempest brewing within her next client.  Eleanor, a counseling psychologist known for her calm demeanor and sharp intuition, felt a familiar knot of apprehension tighten in her stomach.  This wasn't just another Tuesday afternoon; this was Elias Thorne's appointment, and Elias Thorne was anything but predictable.
