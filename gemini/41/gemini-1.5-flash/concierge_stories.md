The brass nameplate on the mahogany desk gleamed under the soft glow of the lobby's chandelier:  *Augustine "Gus" Moreau, Concierge*.  Gus adjusted his impeccably knotted burgundy tie, the silk whispering against his crisp white shirt.  Rain lashed against the vast, arched windows of the Hotel Magnifique, blurring the already hazy Parisian night into a watercolour of greys and inky blacks.  Inside, the hotel hummed with a low, luxurious thrum – a symphony of hushed conversations, clinking champagne glasses, and the discreet rustle of expensive fabrics.  The scent of lilies and old leather hung heavy in the air, a familiar and comforting perfume to Gus, who had presided over this opulent haven for twenty years. Tonight, however, the usual quiet elegance felt…charged. A palpable tension vibrated in the hushed corners, a discordant note in the hotel's otherwise harmonious melody.  Something was brewing, something Gus, with his keen eye and even keener intuition, sensed before it even dared to whisper its presence.
