The biting November wind whipped Elias Thorne’s weathered face as he surveyed the skeletal branches of the ancient oak, its leaves long since surrendered to the encroaching winter.  Elias, a man whose life was as intricately woven into the fabric of Blackwood Manor’s grounds as the gnarled roots of that very oak, adjusted the worn wool cap pulled low over his ears.  The manor itself, a gothic behemoth of grey stone and shadowed mullions, loomed behind him, a silent sentinel guarding centuries of secrets.  It wasn't the building itself that held Elias's attention, though. It was the grounds – the meticulously manicured lawns, the frozen ponds reflecting the bruised purple of the twilight sky, and the whispering, windswept gardens that stretched out before him, each a silent testament to his tireless dedication. This was his kingdom, his sanctuary, and tonight, it felt particularly cold and lonely.
