The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune above the gleaming, yet strangely lifeless, rows of refrigerators. Another Tuesday at Appliances Emporium. Agnes Plumtree, a name she always felt sounded more like a minor character in a Dickens novel than a powerhouse salesperson, adjusted her headset and plastered on her most winning smile. Today was going to be different. Today, Agnes Plumtree was going to conquer refrigerators, dishwashers, and the existential dread that seemed to seep into her bones with every unanswered "Can I help you find something?"

The setting was sprawling and aggressively beige. Appliances Emporium, a family-owned business clinging precariously to relevance in the age of online behemoths, occupied a prime corner spot in the Maplewood Mall. The linoleum floor, buffed to within an inch of its life, reflected the harsh lighting, creating an artificial sheen that did little to disguise its age. Aisles were meticulously organized, progressing from basic models to the "luxury" series with features like "temperature-controlled butter compartments" and "smart ice dispensers" - features Agnes secretly suspected were more trouble than they were worth. A faint smell of ozone and stale popcorn permeated the air, a testament to the barely-functioning microwave in the breakroom and the dwindling hopes of Agnes and her colleagues. Beyond the rows of gleaming steel and plastic, the large plate-glass windows offered a depressing view of the mall parking lot, currently sparsely populated with a smattering of sedans and minivans baking in the afternoon sun. It was a scene of suburban stasis, a visual representation of the rut Agnes desperately longed to escape.
