Okay, here's a story opening and setting with the full name of the main character, a tour guide:

**Story Opening:**

"Welcome aboard, ladies and gentlemen, to the most haunted bus tour this side of the Mississippi! I'm thrilled to be your guide for the evening, and I promise, by the time we're through, you'll be sleeping with the lights on."  Esmeralda "Essie" Vasquez grinned, her voice amplified by the microphone, as she scanned the eager faces staring back at her from the dimly lit bus. A few nervous giggles rippled through the group, exactly the reaction she was aiming for. "Now, before we embark on our spectral journey, let me remind you – keep your hands inside the bus at all times. Not because of traffic, mind you, but because…well, some of our resident spirits aren't known for their polite manners."

**Setting:**

The story takes place in the historic city of **New Orleans, Louisiana**, specifically during a humid, twilight evening. Essie's tour originates in the **French Quarter**, a labyrinthine of wrought-iron balconies, flickering gas lamps, and crumbling Creole townhouses. The bus, a vintage, refurbished model with a morbidly fitting nickname of "The Phantom Chariot," is parked outside the **Jackson Square**, its black paint gleaming faintly under the nascent moonlight. The air is thick with the scent of jasmine, beignets, and something else, something indefinable, that hints at a history both vibrant and deeply shadowed. The sounds of jazz music, the murmur of conversations in multiple languages, and the distant rumble of a streetcar all contribute to the city's unique, almost palpable, atmosphere.
