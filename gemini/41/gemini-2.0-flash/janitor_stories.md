## Story Opening and Setting:

**Setting:** The grand, echoing halls of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, specifically the European Paintings wing, just after midnight. The last stragglers of a private gala have finally been ushered out, leaving behind a scattering of champagne flutes, half-eaten canapés, and the lingering scent of expensive perfume. The only light comes from the emergency exit signs and the soft, focused spotlights illuminating the masterpieces that hang on the velvet-draped walls: Van Gogh's sunflowers, Monet's water lilies, Renoir's dancers.

**Opening:**

The squeak of his worn-out shoes echoed in the cavernous space, a sound that usually went unnoticed, but tonight seemed deafening. Miguel Angel Ramirez, a man built more for comfort than speed, pushed his oversized cleaning cart down the length of the Impressionist gallery. He paused before Monet’s “Water Lilies,” his breath fogging slightly against the glass. He'd seen it a thousand times, maybe more, but the shimmering greens and blues still held him captive, reminding him of the small pond behind his abuela's house in the Dominican Republic. A pang of longing, sharp and familiar, resonated in his chest. He sighed, pushing the cart forward. Time to earn his keep. Tonight, even the ghosts of artists deserved a clean museum.
