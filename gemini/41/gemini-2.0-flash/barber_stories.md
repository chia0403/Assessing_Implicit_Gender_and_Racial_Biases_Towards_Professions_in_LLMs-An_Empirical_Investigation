## Story Opening:

The bell above the door jingled a cheerful, if slightly rusty, greeting as another gust of wind rattled Clement’s Barbershop. Bartholomew "Bart" Finch, a man whose meticulously trimmed mustache seemed perpetually poised for judgement, sighed and dipped his comb in the Barbicide. He was expecting Mr. Abernathy any minute, and the man was notoriously punctual, not to mention particularly critical of any stray hair left on his crisp, white collar. Outside, the November rain continued its relentless drumming on the corrugated iron awning, painting the grey streets in a deeper shade of gloom. Bart tightened his grip on the comb, a familiar twitch returning to his left eyelid. This Tuesday was shaping up to be just like any other, predictably dreary and utterly unremarkable. He couldn’t have been more wrong.

## Setting:

Clement’s Barbershop, nestled on the corner of Elm Street and Oak Avenue in the small, forgotten town of Havenwood, Ohio, had seen better days. The peeling paint on the exterior was a testament to years of neglect, and the window display, featuring a slightly faded photo of a 1950s pompadour, felt more like a relic of a bygone era than a modern advertisement. Inside, the shop held a comforting, if slightly dusty, charm. Two well-worn barber chairs, upholstered in cracked, forest-green leather, faced a large, fogged-over mirror. Shelves lined the walls, cluttered with various tonics, aftershaves, and forgotten pomades, their labels faded and peeling. The air hung heavy with the scent of Old Spice, Barbicide, and a faint undercurrent of something vaguely…herbal. A vintage cash register, its numbers worn smooth by years of use, sat perched on a small counter next to a stack of dog-eared magazines and newspapers, all at least a decade out of date. The overall impression was one of quiet decay, a place where time moved a little slower, and the echoes of bygone conversations still lingered in the air.
