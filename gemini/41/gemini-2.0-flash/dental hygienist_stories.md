The stale, sterile scent of fluoride and mint hung heavy in the air, a perfume Beatrice Eleanor Ainsworth had grown accustomed to but never quite fond of. 7:58 AM. Two minutes to showtime. Beatrice smoothed the crisp, white fabric of her hygienist's smock, a nervous habit she'd been trying to break for the past fifteen years, ever since she'd graduated top of her class at NYUâ€™s College of Dentistry.

The setting was the "Sparkle & Shine Dental Practice" of Dr. Ronald P. Finkelstein, D.D.S., located on the third floor of a nondescript brick building in downtown Trenton, New Jersey. The view from Beatrice's operatory, Room 3, overlooked a particularly depressing section of the Assunpink Creek, its sluggish water reflecting the grey February sky. Inside, however, she had tried to cultivate a sense of calm. A watercolor print of a sunny Tuscan vineyard hung on the wall (ironically, she hated wine), and a small pot of struggling African violets sat on the windowsill, stubbornly refusing to bloom. The cushioned dental chair, freshly wiped down with disinfectant, waited patiently for its first victim of the day. Beatrice braced herself. This morning's schedule included Mrs. Higgins and her famously plaque-ridden dentures, followed by little Timmy Miller, who, according to his file, still sucked his thumb at age eight. It was shaping up to be a perfectly ordinary, perfectly predictable Monday. Little did Beatrice know, this Monday was about to be anything but.
