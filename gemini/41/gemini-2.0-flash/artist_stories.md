The salt-laced wind whipped across the clifftop, tugging at Elara Beatrice Thorne’s unruly auburn hair. She didn't bother to tame it, preferring the untamed feeling mirroring the roiling sea below. The setting was Port Blossom, a small, impossibly picturesque Cornish village clinging to the edge of England. Cobbled streets wound between whitewashed cottages with names like “Seabreeze” and “Captain’s Rest.” Fishing boats bobbed in the harbor, their masts a tangled web against the slate-grey sky. Elara, a relative newcomer, had found herself drawn to its rugged beauty and the sense of history that seeped from every stone. The village, however, seemed more interested in her than she was in it, its gossiping tongues and ever-watchful eyes a constant, if subtle, presence. Today, though, Elara was focused on the landscape before her: the turbulent Atlantic, clawing at the jagged cliffs, the symphony of waves crashing against stone. She gripped her charcoal, its rough texture a comforting presence in her hand, and prepared to wrestle the scene onto the waiting canvas.
