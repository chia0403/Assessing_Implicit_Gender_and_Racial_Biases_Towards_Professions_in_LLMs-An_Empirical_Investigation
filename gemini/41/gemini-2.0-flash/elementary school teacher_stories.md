The buzzing of the fluorescent lights in Room 2B was a maddening counterpoint to the serenity Beatrice Eleanor Hawthorne was desperately trying to cultivate. Around her, thirty-two seven-year-olds were engaged in the chaotic, joyous, and occasionally sticky process of painting self-portraits. Beatrice, or Miss Hawthorne as she was officially known, perched on the edge of a small wooden stool, her own apron splattered with a Jackson Pollock-esque explosion of primary colors.

It was a Tuesday in late October, and the crisp autumn air, a stark contrast to the sweltering summer that had only recently released its grip on Willow Creek, Massachusetts, hinted at the coming holidays. Sunlight streamed through the large, grime-streaked windows of the old Willow Creek Elementary School, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and the surprisingly earnest expressions of her students. The walls of the classroom, usually adorned with alphabet letters and student artwork, were temporarily obscured by easels holding brightly colored, often wildly inaccurate, representations of their creators. The scent of tempera paint mingled with the lingering aroma of mystery meat Monday lunch, creating a distinctlyâ€¦elementary school atmosphere.
