## Story Opening:

The biting wind, a constant companion on the Isle of Skye, whipped Dr. Alistair MacLeod's thick wool scarf tighter around his neck. He squinted against the driving rain, the grey sky mirroring the turbulent waters churning in the narrow inlet below. The Land Rover, affectionately nicknamed 'The Haggis,' shuddered as it bounced along the rutted track, its headlights struggling to pierce the gloom. A single, flickering light in the distance offered a promise of warmth and respite. He hoped. Tonight's call was from Old Maggie, a crofter with a lung condition that stubbornly refused to respond to treatment. Alistair suspected it was less about medicine and more about company, a listening ear to the woes of a woman alone on a remote hillside. Still, he answered every call, every time. That was the price, and the privilege, of being the only doctor for miles.

## Setting:

The story is set on the Isle of Skye, a rugged and beautiful island off the west coast of Scotland. The landscape is dominated by dramatic mountains, windswept moorlands, and jagged coastlines. Small, isolated communities cling to the hillsides, their traditional crofting practices a way of life passed down through generations. The weather is notoriously unpredictable, shifting from sunshine to torrential rain in a matter of minutes. The population is small and close-knit, deeply connected to their land and their heritage. Access to the mainland is limited, and resources can be scarce, adding to the challenges of living and working in such a remote location. The closest larger town, Portree, offers limited services and is a considerable drive away, particularly in harsh weather conditions. The atmosphere is one of both breathtaking beauty and stark isolation, where the resilience of the human spirit is constantly tested by the forces of nature.
