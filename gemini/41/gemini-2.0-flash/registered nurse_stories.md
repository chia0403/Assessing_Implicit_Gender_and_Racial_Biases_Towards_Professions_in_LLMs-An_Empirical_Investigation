The rhythmic hiss of the ventilator was the lullaby of Intensive Care, a song Amelia Grace Hawthorne had grown intimately familiar with over the past seven years. Tonight, however, it was punctuated by a different, sharper note: the frantic beeping of Mrs. Abernathy's heart monitor. Amelia, her dark hair pulled back in a tight bun, adjusted her glasses and leaned closer to the screen, her own heart hammering a frantic counterpoint. Outside, the relentless Chicago wind howled a mournful cry against the brick walls of St. Jude's General, a sound that mirrored the internal unease clawing at her. The city lights, usually a comforting beacon in the sprawling urban landscape, seemed dimmed and distant, swallowed by the oppressive darkness that blanketed the hospital. St. Jude's wasn't just her workplace; it was a crucible, forging resilience and heartache in equal measure. And tonight, the crucible was red-hot.
