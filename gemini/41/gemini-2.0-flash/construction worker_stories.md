The biting November wind whipped around the unfinished steel skeleton of the new skyscraper, a howling testament to Elias Thorne's life. Up here, thirty stories above the churning, honking city, he could almost forget about the gnawing emptiness that followed him everywhere. The steel groaned under the assault of the wind, a low, mournful song that resonated deep in Elias’s bones. He braced himself against the icy strut, his calloused fingers gripping the cold metal.

The setting was downtown Chicago, a concrete jungle sprawling towards the seemingly endless horizon. Cranes, like giant praying mantises, dotted the skyline, a constant reminder of the ceaseless ambition of the city. The ground, a dizzying distance below, was a blur of yellow cabs and hurried pedestrians, ant-like in their movements. Even from this height, the cacophony of the city – sirens, car horns, and the distant rumble of trains – was a constant hum, a mechanical heartbeat that pulsed beneath Elias's feet. The sky above was a bruised purple, heavy with the promise of snow. This was Elias’s domain, a world of heights and dangers, of grit and steel. This was where he felt most alive, ironically, surrounded by the skeletal remains of something yet to be born.
