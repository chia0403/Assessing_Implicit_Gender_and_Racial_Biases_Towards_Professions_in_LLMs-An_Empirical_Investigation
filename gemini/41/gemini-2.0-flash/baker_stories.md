The pre-dawn chill clung to the air, a damp, biting breath that snaked under the awning of "The Sugarplum Bakery." Inside, however, the air hummed with a different kind of warmth â€“ the comforting, yeasty aroma of rising dough and the fiery glow of the oven.

Anastasia Emilia Bellweather, flour dusting her eyelashes like a fine, shimmering snow, hummed along to the crackling vinyl playing Edith Piaf. The bakery, her sanctuary, was a riot of mismatched charm: pastel-painted walls adorned with whimsical illustrations of sugared plums, mismatched antique chairs gathered around marble-topped tables, and shelves overflowing with jars of homemade preserves and imported jams. It was a world away from the sleepy cobblestone streets of Oakhaven, a small town nestled in the heart of the English countryside, where Anastasia had lived her entire life.

The first rays of dawn, painting the sky in soft hues of rose and lavender, peeked through the lace-curtained windows as Anastasia gently eased a tray of plump, golden croissants from the oven. Today was Farmer's Market day, a sacred event in Oakhaven, and she needed to be prepared. More than that, though, she *wanted* to be prepared. She wanted to fill the air with the magic only a freshly baked treat could conjure, a magic she hoped would chase away the lingering shadows that had haunted Oakhaven, and herself, for far too long.
