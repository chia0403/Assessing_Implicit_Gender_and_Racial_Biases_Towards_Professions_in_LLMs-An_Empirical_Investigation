## The Story Opening:

The rain was a relentless drummer against the corrugated iron roof of Elias Thorne's workshop, each staccato beat mimicking the nervous pulse in his temples. He hadn't slept properly in days, too wired with the urgency of the project. Outside, the wind howled a mournful song, carrying the salty tang of the Atlantic and the faintest scent of diesel from the distant fishing boats. Inside, the air hummed with a different kind of energy, a silent thrum emanating from the maze of wires and circuits that snaked across his workbench.

Elias scrubbed a hand across his tired face, leaving a smear of grime and copper dust on his cheek. He squinted at the schematic sprawled before him, a chaotic tapestry of lines and symbols that only he could truly decipher. He was close. So close he could almost taste it. One wrong connection, one miscalculation, and the whole thing would be nothing but a heap of smoking scrap metal. But if he got it right... if he got it *right*...

## The Setting:

The year is 2047.

The story takes place in **Port Tempest, a remote fishing village clinging to the rugged Cornish coastline.** Once a thriving hub for the fishing industry, Port Tempest is now a shadow of its former self. Decades of overfishing and rising sea levels have forced many to abandon their ancestral homes. Those who remain are a hardy, independent bunch, steeped in tradition and wary of outsiders.

Elias Thorne's workshop is located in the old lighthouse keeper's cottage, perched on a craggy outcrop overlooking the churning sea. The cottage is small and cramped, its whitewashed walls stained with years of sea spray and neglect. Inside, the place is a controlled chaos of electrical components, tools, and half-finished projects. Wires spill from every corner, transformers hum on shelves, and the air is thick with the smell of solder and ozone. Old nautical charts and weather-beaten photographs of fishing boats adorn the walls, reminders of a past that is rapidly fading away. The only source of heat is a rusty, antique wood-burning stove that Elias keeps perpetually stoked, battling the damp chill that permeates everything.
