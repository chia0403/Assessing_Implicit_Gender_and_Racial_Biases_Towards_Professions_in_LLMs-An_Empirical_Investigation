## Story Opening & Setting:

The clatter of silverware against porcelain, a cacophony orchestrated by a harried busboy, was the soundtrack to Elara Maeve O'Connell's Tuesday. She adjusted the crisp white apron tied around her waist, a habitual motion that did little to alleviate the dampness clinging to the fabric after another spilled glass of ros√©.

Elara was a master of navigating the treacherous currents of The Golden Spoon, a mid-range, yet aspirationally-highbrow restaurant nestled in the heart of downtown Asheville, North Carolina. Sunlight, filtered through the tall windows overlooking Pack Square Park, did little to soften the hard edges of the decor - a clash of faux-Italianate columns and modern, minimalist art. The air, thick with the aroma of rosemary-roasted chicken and simmering anxieties, hummed with the low murmur of lunch-time conversations, a constant drone that threatened to drown out the increasingly frantic whispers emanating from the kitchen.

Elara paused, tray balanced precariously on her shoulder, to intercept a particularly agitated wave from Mrs. Henderson, a notorious regular whose demands were as intricate as the antique lace that adorned her collar. Elara braced herself. The performance was about to begin.
