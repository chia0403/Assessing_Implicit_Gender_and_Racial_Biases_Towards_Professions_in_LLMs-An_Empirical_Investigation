Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a drafting worker as the main character:

**Story Opening:**

The hum of the fluorescent lights was a constant, dull ache behind Eleanor Beatrice Davies' eyes. She squinted at the blueprint spread across her drafting table, the fine lines blurring under the harsh glare. Another support beam, another connecting joint, another millimeter-perfect calculation that stood between the architect's vision and a skyscraper that wouldn't crumble under its own weight. Outside, the city throbbed with the relentless energy of a summer morning, sirens wailing and car horns bleating. Inside, Eleanor was lost in a world of steel and concrete, her pencils her only weapons against chaos. She paused, tapping a fingernail against her teeth, a familiar habit that usually preceded a breakthrough. But today, the problem wasn't structural integrity. Today, the problem was a feeling, a nagging sense ofâ€¦wrongness that clung to the design like dust motes in a sunbeam.

**Setting:**

The setting is the office of "Sterling & Bell Architectural Firm," located on the 14th floor of a glass and steel skyscraper in downtown Chicago. The office space is functional and utilitarian, a stark contrast to the artistic designs the firm produces. Eleanor's personal workspace is a corner nook overlooking a partially obscured view of Lake Michigan. Her drafting table is cluttered with blueprints, technical manuals, sharpened pencils, erasers, and a half-empty mug of lukewarm coffee. The air is thick with the scent of paper and the faint, metallic tang of printer toner. The walls are painted a neutral gray, adorned with framed photographs of the firm's most successful projects. Beyond her cubicle partition, the sounds of keyboard clicks, hushed conversations, and the rhythmic whirring of the plotter provide a constant, low-level hum of activity. Sunlight, filtered through the office's tinted windows, casts long, geometric shadows across the floor. There is an overall sense of busy, focused efficiency punctuated by the occasional bursts of creativity and frustration.
