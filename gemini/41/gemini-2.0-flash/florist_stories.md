## Opening:

The scent of lilies, both cloying and comforting, was Henrietta Plum’s constant companion. It clung to her fingertips, woven into the seams of her worn linen apron, even permeated the very air around her, a fragrant halo marking her as undeniably, gloriously, a florist. This morning, though, the lilies seemed to scream, their perfume almost aggressive as she wrestled with a particularly stubborn stem of Casablanca, the heavy, ivory petals refusing to bend to her will.

“Blast it all,” she muttered, finally snipping the stem clean with a decisive *snip* of her shears. Her temper, a rare but potent thing, was simmering. The cause wasn’t the recalcitrant lily, not really. It was the emptiness in the shop, the oppressive silence that had settled like a shroud over "Plum’s Posies" these last few weeks. Even Mrs. Higgins, renowned for ordering a spray of cheerful daisies every Tuesday, had been a no-show.

Henrietta rubbed a smudge of pollen from her cheek with the back of her hand and glanced out the window, her gaze drawn to the overcast sky that mirrored the gloom in her heart. Could a florist starve to death in the middle of bustling Oakhaven? She was starting to suspect the answer was a resounding, and rather fragrant, yes.

## Setting:

**Plum’s Posies** was nestled on the corner of Elm Street and Willow Avenue in the heart of Oakhaven, a charming, if slightly faded, town known for its annual pumpkin festival and its surprisingly robust community theater scene. The shop itself was a testament to Henrietta’s personality: a delightful, slightly chaotic blend of old-fashioned charm and vibrant color.

The front of the shop boasted a large, arched window filled with cascading vines of ivy, potted geraniums in a riot of reds and pinks, and strategically placed seasonal blooms. Inside, the air was thick with the mingled fragrances of hundreds of flowers. Wooden shelves, painted a soft, faded blue, lined the walls, laden with hand-painted watering cans, delicate glass vases, and whimsical ceramic figurines.

A worn, but comfortable, armchair sat in one corner, piled high with flower arranging books and catalogs. Behind a long wooden counter, cluttered with ribbons, twine, and a collection of antique scissors, was Henrietta’s workspace: a stainless steel sink, a large, well-worn cutting board, and buckets overflowing with a kaleidoscope of floral treasures.

The floors were tiled in a charming, if slightly uneven, pattern of black and white squares. A bell, shaped like a tiny hummingbird, chimed cheerfully whenever the door opened, its bright sound a hopeful counterpoint to the creeping silence of slow business. Oakhaven itself, despite its charming facade, was beginning to feel…different. More competitive, less neighborly. And Henrietta, with her old-fashioned ways and unwavering belief in the power of a perfectly placed rose, was starting to feel like a flower out of season.
