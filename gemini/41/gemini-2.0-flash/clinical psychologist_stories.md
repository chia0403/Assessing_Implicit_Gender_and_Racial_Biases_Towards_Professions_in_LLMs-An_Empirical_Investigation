Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a story featuring a clinical psychologist:

**Setting:** A late October evening in the small, windswept coastal town of Port Blossom, Maine. The sky is a bruised purple, threatening rain. The air is thick with the smell of salt and decaying seaweed. Most of the town's residents are already inside, seeking refuge from the creeping chill, but a few stubborn souls still huddle around the harbor, their faces lit by the flickering glow of the lighthouse in the distance.

**Opening:**

The antique brass hinges protested with a mournful groan as Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth pushed open the heavy oak door of the Port Blossom Historical Society. Inside, the air was musty, thick with the scent of aged paper and forgotten things. Eleanor adjusted the strap of her worn leather messenger bag, the low light making the shadows in her face deepen. She always felt a strange resonance within these walls. Tonight, it bordered on oppressive.

She shivered, despite the heavy wool coat she wore. The thermostat, usually a point of heated contention between her and the society’s treasurer, Mrs. Higgins, was clearly set far too low. As if the cold weren't enough of a reminder of the season's decay.

The reason Eleanor was here, though, was less about the past and more about the present. Or, perhaps, the present as haunted by the past. She’d received a desperate call that afternoon, a call she hadn’t anticipated and wasn't sure she was prepared for. Tonight, Eleanor Ainsworth, clinical psychologist, would try to help the newest patient with an old problem. A problem Port Blossom had buried for too long.
