The hum of the Pratt & Whitney engines vibrated through the floor of the Boeing 777, a low, reassuring thrum that usually soothed Amelia Beatrice Fairchild. Tonight, however, it only amplified the nervous tremor in her hands as she ran a final check of her cabin, preparing for descent into Singapore's Changi Airport.

The crimson and gold batik upholstery, painstakingly chosen to evoke a sense of luxurious calm, seemed to mock her disquiet. Overhead, the soft, diffused lighting cast long, ethereal shadows down the aisle, making the empty seats appear as if occupied by ghostly passengers. Outside the oval windows, the inky blackness of the Indian Ocean pressed in, broken only by the faint, shimmering lights of distant cargo ships.

Amelia had flown this route, London Heathrow to Singapore Changi, countless times in her fifteen years with Singapore Airlines. She knew every creak and groan of the aircraft, every lull and surge in the air pressure. But tonight was different. Tonight, a knot of unease tightened in her stomach, a premonition she couldn't shake. Maybe it was the full moon, bloated and malevolent in the sky earlier, or perhaps just the accumulated stress of a particularly demanding passenger manifest. Whatever the cause, Amelia felt a prickling sensation on the back of her neck, a feeling that she was being watched, a feeling that something…unforeseen… was about to happen. The "Fasten Seatbelt" sign pinged to life with a sharp, electronic buzz, and Amelia took a deep breath, forcing a professional smile onto her face. "Cabin crew, prepare for landing." The automated voice echoed through the aircraft, and Amelia, despite her creeping anxiety, braced herself. This was her job. This was what she did. But tonight, she couldn't shake the feeling that it wouldn't just be another routine landing.
