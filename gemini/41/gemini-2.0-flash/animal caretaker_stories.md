Okay, here's a story opening and setting for you, featuring a main character who's an animal caretaker:

**Setting:** The sun beat down on the dusty plains surrounding the sprawling "Havenwood Sanctuary," a refuge for rescued and rehabilitated wildlife nestled on the fringes of the Namib Desert in Namibia. Baobab trees stood like ancient sentinels, their swollen trunks providing the only respite from the relentless heat. The air crackled with the buzz of insects and the distant calls of birds of prey. The Sanctuary itself was a collection of meticulously maintained enclosures, each designed to mimic the natural habitat of its inhabitants, ranging from orphaned meerkats to injured cheetahs. A central complex housed the administrative offices, a small veterinary clinic, and the living quarters for the dedicated team of caretakers.

**Opening:**

The metallic clang of the gate latch echoed in the still morning air, jolting Dr. Amelia "Amy" Rosewood from her reverie. She stood before the enclosure of Kali, a magnificent, yet scarred, leopard rescued from a snare months ago. Amelia, her long, auburn hair pulled back into a practical braid and her khaki uniform already dusted with the fine red sand, took a deep breath. Another day, another round of medications to administer, wounds to clean, and hopes to nurture. She ran a calloused hand along the smooth metal of the gate. Kali was a particular challenge, wary of humans despite Amelia’s tireless efforts to earn her trust. The leopard's amber eyes, filled with a primal mistrust, followed Amelia's every move as she entered, a bucket filled with fresh meat in her hand. This wasn't just a job; it was a promise. A promise to give Kali, and every creature within Havenwood’s fences, a second chance at life. And Amy Rosewood never broke a promise.
