## Opening:

The chipped porcelain of Penelope Ainsworth's mug warmed her hands as she surveyed the lobby. It was 5:57 AM, the pre-dawn stillness clinging to the air like the scent of expensive, faintly stale lilies â€“ a perfume she'd grown numb to after five years at the Grand Meridian Hotel. Outside, the city was still slumbering, unaware of the intricate choreography about to begin within these gilded walls. Penelope sighed, the steam from her Earl Grey fogging her spectacles. Another day, another hundred requests, another thousand polite smiles masking the weary ache in her feet. She took a final sip, the bitter tea doing little to dispel the premonition humming beneath her skin - today wouldn't be just another day at the Grand Meridian.

## Setting:

The Grand Meridian Hotel, a monument to Gilded Age excess, occupied a prime location on Fifth Avenue in New York City. Its facade, a symphony of ornate carvings and gleaming marble, stood in defiant contrast to the modern skyscrapers that clawed at the sky around it. Inside, the lobby was a testament to opulent grandeur. Crystal chandeliers, each a cascading waterfall of light, illuminated a vast space adorned with plush carpets, antique furniture, and priceless works of art. The air, perpetually scented with floral arrangements and the faint aroma of polished wood, hummed with a low, constant thrum of activity. Concierge desk, made of dark mahogany and inlaid with intricate mother-of-pearl, was Penelope Ainsworth's domain, a strategic vantage point from which she observed the daily dramas of the hotel's inhabitants, from visiting dignitaries and celebrated artists to high-powered executives and elusive celebrities. Behind her, a meticulously organized wall held a plethora of maps, brochures, and restaurant recommendations, each a weapon in her arsenal of concierge expertise.
