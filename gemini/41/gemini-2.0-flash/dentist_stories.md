**Story Opening:**

The whine of the drill vibrated through Dr. Evelyn Rose Thatcher's bones, a familiar tremor that usually soothed her, a rhythmic counterpoint to the anxieties held captive in the dental chair. Today, however, it was a discordant scream in her head. She focused on the swirling water, the gleam of the porcelain cuspids she was meticulously shaping, anything to drown out the internal monologue that had been plaguing her for days.

"Almost done, Mrs. Henderson," Evelyn said, her voice deliberately calm, a practiced balm to anxious patients. "Just a little more polishing and you'll be as good as new."

Mrs. Henderson, a sweet woman whose teeth were unfortunately as addicted to sugar as Evelyn was to vintage mysteries, mumbled something unintelligible through the cotton rolls and suction tube.

Evelyn smiled, a reflex honed over years of practice, but her thoughts were miles away, tracing the tangled threads of a puzzle she couldn't quite piece together. It had started with a missing antique dental chair, a chair identical to one she'd secretly coveted for years, and was rapidly spiraling into something far more unsettling.

**Setting:**

Evelyn Rose Thatcher's dental practice, "Thatcher Family Dentistry," occupied a charming, albeit slightly dilapidated, Victorian house in the historic district of Havenwood, Maine. The exterior boasted peeling white paint, gingerbread trim, and a riotous garden overflowing with hydrangeas and roses, a testament to her grandmother's green thumb, though Evelyn did her best to maintain it.

Inside, the waiting room was a carefully curated blend of old and new. The walls were painted a soothing sage green and adorned with framed antique dental tools and black and white photographs of previous Thatcher family dentists. Plush, mismatched armchairs and a crackling fireplace offered a comfortable, homey feel, a deliberate attempt to alleviate the inherent dread associated with the dentist.

The actual treatment rooms, however, were modern and meticulously clean, reflecting Evelyn's commitment to providing top-notch dental care. State-of-the-art equipment gleamed under bright, adjustable lights. Despite the modernization, Evelyn had managed to retain some of the building's original charm, incorporating vintage touches like antique apothecary jars filled with cotton rolls and a small, intricately carved wooden cabinet that held her collection of rare dental probes. The entire practice felt like a comforting blend of history and cutting-edge technology, a reflection of Evelyn herself.
