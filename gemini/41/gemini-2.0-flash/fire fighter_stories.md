Okay, here's a story opening with the setting and full name of the main character, a firefighter:

**Story Opening:**

The clatter of the alarm ripped through the pre-dawn quiet, scattering the fragile dreams clinging to Captain Evander "Van" Blackwood. He lurched upright, tangled in the sheets, the sound a familiar, unwelcome intrusion into the precious few hours he managed to steal between shifts.  He didn't need to look at the clock – 04:17.  Just enough time for a stale cup of coffee and a primal scream into the pre-dawn darkness.

He kicked the sheets off and fumbled for his boots, already half-awake and running on instinct. The automated dispatcher’s voice crackled from the speaker on the wall, its robotic monotone delivering the news that every firefighter dreaded: "Structure fire, commercial, possible entrapment.  Address: 112 Elm Street. Units responding: Engine 22, Truck 8, Medic 5.  Repeat..."

A shiver snaked down Van's spine. Elm Street.  That was Old Man Hemlock’s woodworking shop.  Hemlock was a local treasure, a craftsman known for his intricate carvings and gruff demeanor. Van had stopped in there countless times, admiring the man's dedication to his craft. He hoped to God the "possible entrapment" wasn't Hemlock himself.

**Setting:**

The story is set in the small, close-knit town of Havenwood, nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains in western North Carolina. Havenwood is a town where everyone knows everyone, and community ties run deep.  While modern life has encroached with its chain stores on the edge of town, the heart of Havenwood still retains its old-fashioned charm, with a historic town square, family-owned businesses, and a slower pace of life.

The fire station, Havenwood Fire Department Station 1, is located just off the town square, a brick building that has been a fixture in the community for over seventy years. It's more than just a place where firefighters work; it's a second home, filled with camaraderie, shared meals, and the weight of responsibility for the safety of their neighbors.
