The midday sun, a molten coin in the smoggy Los Angeles sky, pressed against the glass of the "Serene Sanctuary" massage studio. Inside, the air was a cool, lavender-scented balm, a deliberate contrast to the urban heat outside. Sunlight sliced through the blinds, painting zebra stripes across the polished bamboo floor.

This was where Alistair Finch perfected his craft, where the tension of Hollywood executives, struggling actors, and overworked assistants melted under his skilled hands. He was a connoisseur of muscle knots, a whisperer to stressed-out spines, and today, he was anticipating a particularly knotty case: Cassandra Blake, the fiery-haired producer known for her take-no-prisoners attitude and her string of box-office hits. He'd heard whispers that she carried the weight of a hundred bad scripts on her shoulders.

Alistair, a man whose gentle nature was only hinted at by the calming music that always played in the background, checked the settings on the massage table one last time. The plush, heated surface was a small oasis of comfort, and the aromatherapy diffuser hummed softly, releasing a blend of chamomile and bergamot. He straightened the crisp white towels and took a deep breath, hoping he could coax some semblance of peace into the steel trap that was Cassandra Blake.
