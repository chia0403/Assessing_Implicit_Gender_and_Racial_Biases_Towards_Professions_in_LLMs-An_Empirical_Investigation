Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a groundskeeper as the main character:

**Story Opening:**

The dew hung heavy on the emerald blades of the Putting Green Number Three, clinging to the meticulously cut grass like tiny, trembling diamonds. Bartholomew Reginald Higgins, known to everyone at the exclusive Blackwood Country Club as simply "Barth," squatted low, his calloused fingers gently probing the damp earth near a suspect patch of brown. He could practically hear Mr. Abernathy, the club president, choking on his imported cigars if even a single blade of grass dared to look sickly during the prestigious Blackwood Invitational, just a week away. Bartholomew sighed, the sound misting in the crisp morning air. This wasn't just a job to him; it was an art. And art didn't tolerate imperfections. This particular imperfection, however, was more peculiar than usual. It wasn't the familiar fungal blight, nor the tell-tale signs of grub damage. This wasâ€¦ different. There was a faint, almost metallic scent clinging to the affected area, and a strange, subtle energy that made the hairs on the back of his neck prickle. Bartholomew pulled out a small, battered notebook from his pocket, the pages filled with his meticulous notes on soil composition, weather patterns, and the specific quirks of each individual green. He added a new entry: *Putting Green #3: Anomaly. Scent of metal. Prickling sensation.* Then, he glanced up at the dawning sky, a growing unease settling in his stomach. He had a feeling this anomaly was about to become much bigger than a blemish on the putting green.

**Setting:**

The story is set at the **Blackwood Country Club**, nestled amidst the rolling hills of a wealthy, secluded area just outside of Hartford, Connecticut. The club is known for its impeccably maintained 18-hole golf course, sprawling clubhouse reminiscent of a grand manor house, pristine tennis courts, and a palpable air of exclusivity. The grounds are meticulously manicured, with vibrant flowerbeds, ancient oak trees lining the fairways, and sparkling ponds strategically placed to challenge golfers. The overall atmosphere is one of old money, quiet elegance, and unwavering tradition. The story takes place during the week leading up to the annual Blackwood Invitational, a prestigious golf tournament that attracts players from around the world and brings heightened scrutiny to every blade of grass on the property. The time period is modern day.
