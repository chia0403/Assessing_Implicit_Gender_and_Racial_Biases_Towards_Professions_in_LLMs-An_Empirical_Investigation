## The Opening

The siren's wail ripped through the thick, humid air, a discordant screech against the chirping of cicadas that stubbornly clung to the sweltering August night. Officer Isabella “Izzy” Diaz gripped the steering wheel of her Crown Vic a little tighter, the sweat slicking her palms making the leather feel oddly reptilian. Rain, fat and lazy, began to fall, plastering itself to the windshield and blurring the already sparse streetlights. The call had been vague, a potential domestic disturbance on Willow Creek Road, but the dispatcher’s frantic tone had spoken volumes. Izzy had learned in her five years on the force that those were the calls you never took lightly. Those were the calls that haunted your sleep.

## The Setting

The town of Havenwood, North Carolina, nestled deep in the heart of the Appalachian foothills, was the kind of place where everyone knew everyone, and secrets simmered beneath the surface like a pot left too long on the back burner. The air, usually sweet with the scent of pine and honeysuckle, tonight reeked of damp earth and brewing trouble. Willow Creek Road was a particularly desolate stretch, a narrow ribbon of asphalt lined with dilapidated clapboard houses and overgrown yards choked with kudzu. Many of the houses were dark, the residents likely tucked away behind locked doors, pretending not to hear the echoes of their neighbor's misery. The rain intensified, turning the road into a shimmering river reflecting the garish neon sign of the "Havenwood Tavern" a block back, a lonely beacon in the gathering darkness. Izzy slowed, her headlights cutting through the downpour, searching for the address. The peace, however fragile, of Havenwood was about to be shattered.
