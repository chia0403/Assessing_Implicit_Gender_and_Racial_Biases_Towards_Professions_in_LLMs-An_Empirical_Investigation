The clatter of the rain against the corrugated iron roof of the shack threatened to drown out the plaintive melody emanating from Eleanor "Ellie" Ainsworth's ancient record player. The shack, a dilapidated structure overlooking the churning, slate-grey Atlantic, served as Ellie's escape. It was more glorified shed than writer's retreat, a stark contrast to the bustling, literary world she usually inhabited in London. Here, on the rugged, windswept coast of County Donegal, Ireland, the air was thick with the scent of salt and peat, and the only distractions were the relentless gulls and the occasional curious sheep. Inside, the cramped space was a chaotic tapestry of Ellie's life: overflowing bookshelves threatening to topple over, stacks of handwritten pages overflowing from battered notebooks, and half-empty mugs of lukewarm tea forming a ringed constellation on every available surface. The only concession to comfort was a worn armchair pulled close to a flickering gas heater, and a stack of well-loved vinyl records – Billie Holiday, Nina Simone, Leonard Cohen – providing a soundtrack to her struggles. Ellie, a writer wrestling with a crippling case of writer's block after the immense success of her debut novel, had come to Ireland seeking inspiration, or perhaps just oblivion. But so far, the only thing she had found was more rain.
