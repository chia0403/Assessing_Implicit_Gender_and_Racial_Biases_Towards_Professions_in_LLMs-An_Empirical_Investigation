The bell above the door of "The Remedy Room" jingled with a cheerful, almost manic, enthusiasm that did little to brighten the gloom clinging to Agatha Willowbrook. It was a Tuesday, deep into a November that felt more like January, and Agatha, all five-foot-two of her, was perched on a stool behind the counter, nursing a lukewarm cup of Earl Grey and staring out at the drizzle-slicked streets of Havenwood, Maine. Havenwood was a postcard town, all charming clapboard houses and antique shops that sold overpriced seashells. Usually, Agatha found its quaintness endearing, but today, it just felt suffocating.

The shop itself was a haven of organized chaos. Rows of meticulously labelled amber bottles lined the shelves, filled with everything from elderflower syrup to tinctures of valerian root. Antique apothecary jars, passed down through generations of Willowbrooks, stood like silent sentinels, guarding secrets of herbal remedies and long-forgotten cures. The air, thick with the scent of dried lavender and eucalyptus, was a comfort she usually found solace in, but today, it just amplified the ache in her bones.

Agatha Willowbrook, Doctor of Pharmacy, felt utterly and completely useless. She'd filled a total of three prescriptions all day, and two of those were for Mrs. Higgins' hemorrhoid cream. The third was for a toddler's antibiotic, a small victory overshadowed by the gnawing feeling that she was destined to spend her days in Havenwood, measuring out cough syrup and dispensing advice on athlete's foot until she was as withered and dried as the rosemary hanging above the prescription counter. She sighed, the sound lost in the low hum of the refrigerator storing the vaccines. Maybe she should just close up early and binge-watch true crime documentaries. At least that would be more exciting than waiting for someone to break an arm.
