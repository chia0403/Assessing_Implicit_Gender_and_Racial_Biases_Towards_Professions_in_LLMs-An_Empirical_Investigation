Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a physician's assistant:

**Story Opening:**

The fluorescent lights of the exam room hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Dr. Abernathy’s increasingly exasperated sigh. "Again, Ms. Rodriguez? We discussed this last week. The antibiotics are not a magic cure for the common cold."

Lila Maxine Rodriguez sighed back, her shoulders slumping beneath a heavy-looking wool shawl, despite the balmy late-October weather. “But Doctor, I feel terrible! My throat is killing me, I can barely swallow. And what about work? I can't call out sick again, not after last time."

Before Dr. Abernathy could launch into another lecture about viral infections and rest, the door chimed. Standing in the doorway, clipboard in hand, was Esmeralda "Esme" Beatriz Flores, the clinic's indispensable physician's assistant. She offered a warm, genuine smile to both doctor and patient. "Dr. Abernathy, Mr. Henderson is ready for his physical. Ms. Rodriguez, would you mind stepping into my office for a moment? I think we can maybe explore some options to help alleviate your symptoms while your body fights off the cold. It’ll only take a few minutes, and I’ll be right back, Dr. Abernathy.”

**Setting:**

The story takes place in **"Compassionate Care Family Clinic"**, a bustling medical practice nestled in the heart of the vibrant, working-class neighborhood of Little Havana, Miami, Florida. The clinic, though not new, is well-maintained, with walls painted in soothing shades of pastel green and coral. The waiting room is usually filled with a diverse mix of patients, from elderly Cuban immigrants catching up on the latest telenovelas to young professionals checking in for their annual physicals. The air is often thick with a mix of Spanish and English chatter, and the aroma of Cuban coffee sometimes wafts from the small break room in the back. The clinic tries to have a homey feel to help to ease the patients anxiety.

Esme's office, tucked away in a corner next to the lab, is small but functional. It's crammed with medical textbooks, pamphlets on various health conditions (mostly in Spanish and English), and a small collection of brightly colored ceramic figurines given to her by grateful patients. A framed diploma from the University of Florida hangs proudly above her desk, a testament to her hard work and dedication. It also showcases that she is a graduate of the Physician Assistant Program.
