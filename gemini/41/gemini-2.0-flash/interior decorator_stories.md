## Story Opening:

The scent of lavender and newly milled lumber hung heavy in the air, a paradoxical blend that always made Penelope Ainsworth sneeze. Not a dainty, ladylike sneeze, mind you. This was a full-bodied, honking eruption that threatened to shatter the carefully curated serenity of her latest project: the re-imagining of Mrs. Delphine Abernathy's sprawling, oceanside villa. Penelope pinched the bridge of her nose, willing the tickle away with sheer force of will. 

"Bless you, Penelope," Mrs. Abernathy chirped, her voice as bright and bubbly as the champagne that perpetually seemed to be flowing around her. She was perched precariously on the arm of a newly reupholstered chaise lounge, a vision in silk and diamonds, seemingly oblivious to the sawdust dusting her perfectly coiffed hair.

"Thank you, Delphine," Penelope managed to croak, her voice slightly muffled. She straightened, smoothed down her own linen trousers – a practical choice, she thought, for a day knee-deep in plaster dust – and forced a smile. "Just a bit of dust."

But the dust, Penelope knew, wasn't entirely to blame. A knot of anxiety had been tightening in her stomach since she'd arrived this morning. Something felt… off. More than the usual pre-installation jitters. Perhaps it was the unsettling glint in Mrs. Abernathy's normally guileless blue eyes, or the way the morning light seemed to cast long, distorted shadows across the gleaming marble floors. Whatever it was, Penelope had a feeling this particular project was about to become a whole lot more complicated than she'd initially bargained for.

## Setting:

The story takes place in the opulent, seaside town of **Avalon Shores, California**. Avalon Shores is known for its dramatic coastal cliffs, its exclusive gated communities filled with sprawling villas, and its residents, a mix of Hollywood elite, tech moguls, and old money families.

Mrs. Abernathy's villa, aptly named **"Seabreeze,"** is perched atop a particularly dramatic cliff overlooking the Pacific Ocean. The villa is three stories high, with a Mediterranean-inspired architecture: white stucco walls, terracotta roof tiles, and arched windows offering panoramic views. The interior is currently in a state of controlled chaos, a whirlwind of fabric samples, paint swatches, and furniture awaiting its final placement. Outside, the scent of salt and blooming jasmine hangs heavy in the air, a deceptive mask for the undercurrent of secrets that seems to permeate the air in Avalon Shores.
