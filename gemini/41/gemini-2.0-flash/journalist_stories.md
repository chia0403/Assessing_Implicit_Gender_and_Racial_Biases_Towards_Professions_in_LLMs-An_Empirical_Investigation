The lukewarm coffee sloshed precariously in Amelia Josephine Harding's mug as the rickety commuter train lurched violently, threatening to stain her already-worn, navy blue trench coat. Outside, the grimy windows offered a depressing tableau of the decaying industrial landscape that clung to the outskirts of Oakhaven like a persistent cough. Steel skeletons of abandoned factories pierced the perpetually grey sky, their rusted innards exposed to the elements. Graffiti, a cacophony of illegible tags and political slogans, adorned the concrete walls lining the tracks, a visual symphony of urban decay.

Amelia hated the train, hated the commute, and, if she were being honest with herself, hated Oakhaven. But Oakhaven was where the story was, and Amelia Josephine Harding, after five years of covering bake sales and town council meetings in a sleepy upstate New York hamlet, desperately needed a story. Something big. Something that would finally get her noticed.

This train, this dreary landscape, this decaying city, it was all part of the tapestry she hoped to unravel. Today, she was on her way to the Westside Docks, a labyrinthine warren of warehouses and shipping containers, infamous for its shady dealings and even shadier characters. She had a lead â€“ a whispered rumour of a union boss skimming funds, possibly even laundering money for organized crime. It was a long shot, but a shot nonetheless. Amelia clutched her worn leather notebook and a slightly smudged photograph of a man with a face like chipped granite, her adrenaline simmering beneath a layer of carefully cultivated indifference. Oakhaven might be a hellhole, but it was her hellhole, and she was determined to dig up its secrets.
