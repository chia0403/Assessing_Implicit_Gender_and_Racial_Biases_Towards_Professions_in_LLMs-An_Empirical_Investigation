The rusty wrench slipped in Elias Thorne's grip, splattering a fine mist of week-old dishwater onto his already stained overalls. He cursed under his breath, the sound swallowed by the echoing drip, drip, drip of the ancient plumbing in the Winslow Estate's east wing.

The Winslow Estate, perched precariously on the cliffs overlooking the Pacific, was a monument to Victorian excess and slow, agonizing decay. Built in 1888 by the shipping magnate Bartholomew Winslow, the place reeked of money, regret, and, currently, stagnant sewage. It had been abandoned for decades, falling into disrepair, and recently purchased by some tech billionaire with more dollars than sense and a desire to turn it into a "luxury wellness retreat." Hence, Elias's unwelcome presence, wrestling with pipes that looked like they'd been forged in the belly of a kraken.

Sunlight struggled to penetrate the grime-caked windows of what Elias guessed was once a butler's pantry. Dust motes danced in the shafts of light, illuminating cobwebs thick enough to double as hammocks. The air hung heavy with the smell of mildew and something indefinably old â€“ a scent that Elias associated with forgotten secrets and damp, rotting wood. He felt a chill crawl up his spine despite the exertion of his work, a prickling unease that whispered of things unseen lurking just beyond the reach of the dim light. He just hoped whatever those things were, they weren't sharing the pipes with him. He had enough problems already.
