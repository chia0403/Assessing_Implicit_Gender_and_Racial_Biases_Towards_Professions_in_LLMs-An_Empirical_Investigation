The biting wind howled through the crenellations of the north tower, a mournful song that matched Sergeant Silas Blackwood’s mood perfectly. He adjusted the thick fur collar of his worn leather jerkin, pulling it tighter around his neck in a futile attempt to ward off the creeping damp. Each gust felt like a thousand icy needles pricking at his skin. He’d been assigned the night watch on the north tower for what felt like an eternity, and tonight, of all nights, the isolation was crushing him.

The setting was the sprawling fortress of Castle Grimshaw, a monolithic structure of grey stone perched precariously on a cliff overlooking the treacherous Blackwood Sea. Its ramparts, weathered by centuries of relentless storms, were stained with salt and whispered tales of battles long past. Tonight, the sky was a bruised purple, threatening snow, and the only light came from the flickering oil lamp illuminating the small, circular chamber within the north tower. Below, the sea crashed against the jagged rocks, a constant, rhythmic reminder of the wildness that surrounded them. The portcullis, a dark, ominous gate, was lowered, sealing the castle off from the encroaching night. Grimshaw was a prison as much as it was a protector, a cage for the loyal and the damned alike. And tonight, Sergeant Silas Blackwood felt like both.
