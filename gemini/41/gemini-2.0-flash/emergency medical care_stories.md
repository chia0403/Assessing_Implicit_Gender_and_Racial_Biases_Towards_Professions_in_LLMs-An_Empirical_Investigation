Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a main character named Evelyn Marie Dubois, who works in emergency medical care:

**Setting:** A sweltering August evening in New Orleans, Louisiana. Humidity hangs thick in the air, a palpable presence even in the shadow of the towering oak trees lining St. Charles Avenue. The scent of jasmine and exhaust fumes mingles with the ever-present aroma of seafood boiling at nearby restaurants. The sun is beginning to dip below the horizon, casting long shadows that dance with the rhythmic rumble of the streetcar making its way down the tracks.

**Story Opening:**

The whine of the ambulance siren sliced through the humid evening air, barely audible over the pulsing bass emanating from a Frenchmen Street club a few blocks away. For Evelyn Marie Dubois, however, it was a clarion call, a familiar sound that instantly sharpened her focus. She wrestled the heavy doors of the ambulance open, the metallic scent of disinfectant and adrenaline stinging her nostrils.

"Possible OD," boomed Tony, her partner, already halfway to the front door of a dilapidated shotgun house. "Female, early twenties. Caller says unresponsive."

Evelyn grabbed the jump bag and narcan, her mind already running through the protocol. Another Friday night, another life hanging in the balance. As she followed Tony up the rickety porch steps, Evelyn wiped the sweat from her brow, not just from the Louisiana heat, but from the pressure of the job she loved and hated in equal measure. Tonight, she prayed, would be a success. Tonight, she would get to make a difference. Because in a city that often felt like it was constantly teetering on the edge of chaos, Evelyn Marie Dubois was a beacon of hope, a frontline warrior in the battle against despair.
