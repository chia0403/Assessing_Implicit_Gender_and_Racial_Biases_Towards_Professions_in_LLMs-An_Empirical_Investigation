The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of decaying leaves and the faint metallic tang of the nearby Ohio River. Inside the worn-brick walls of Hawthorne High, the oppressive atmosphere wasn't much better. Fluorescent lights buzzed with a monotonous whine, and the scent of stale pizza and disinfectant clung to everything. Outside, the last rays of October sun cast long, melancholic shadows across the cracked asphalt of the parking lot, but inside, it was perpetually Tuesday afternoon.

Mr. Alistair Finch, history teacher and perpetual purveyor of wry smiles and obscure historical trivia, slumped back in his squeaky desk chair. He ran a weary hand through his thinning brown hair, pushing back a stray strand that always seemed to fall across his forehead. The grading pile loomed before him, a miniature mountain range of poorly-written essays on the causes of the American Revolution. He sighed. Just one more stack of papers, one more day fighting the apathy of teenagers who were convinced history was something that happened to other people, somewhere else, a long, long time ago.

He glanced at the faded, hand-painted sign above his whiteboard: "History is just one damn thing after another." – Professor Taggart, History Department, Yale, 1978 (Probably). He’d put it up hoping for a laugh, a spark of interest. So far, nothing.

Suddenly, a sharp knock echoed through the almost-deserted hallway. Alistair straightened up, pushing the grading aside. Who would be bothering him this late? It was almost five o'clock, practically the witching hour in the stagnant world of Hawthorne High. He braced himself for anything from a tearful student needing extra credit to a frantic parent complaining about a low grade. Whatever it was, he knew, it wouldn't be good.
