The humid Iowa air hung thick and heavy, a shimmering curtain that distorted the already blurred horizon. Heat rose in palpable waves from the sun-baked asphalt, making the white lines of Highway 20 seem to writhe and twist like sun-bleached snakes. Earl Franklin, a man built like a dependable Ford pickup truck, wiped a sheen of sweat from his brow with the back of his thick, calloused hand. His orange safety vest, normally a beacon of authority, clung damply to his broad shoulders, offering little relief from the oppressive heat.

The setting was a desolate stretch of Highway 20, somewhere between Sac City and Fort Dodge. Fields of corn, their stalks tall and brittle from the lack of recent rain, stretched endlessly on either side of the two-lane road. The only sound was the drone of cicadas, amplified by the vast emptiness, and the occasional roar of a semi-truck barreling past, leaving a swirling vortex of hot air and dust in its wake. Earl and his crew, the "pothole posse" as they jokingly called themselves, were patching a particularly nasty chasm that had swallowed more than its fair share of unsuspecting hubcaps. Today felt different though. An unsettling quiet had settled over the landscape, a pregnant stillness that made the hairs on Earl's neck prickle. He had a feeling, deep in his gut, that the day was about to get a whole lot more complicated than just filling a hole in the road.
