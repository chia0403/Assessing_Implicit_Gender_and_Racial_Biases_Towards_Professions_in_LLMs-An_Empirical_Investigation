The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the frantic tapping of keys coming from Elias Thorne's cramped cubicle. Elias, a man whose life was as organized and predictable as a well-balanced spreadsheet, felt a bead of sweat trickle down his temple. He adjusted his tie, a navy blue number he'd bought on sale at Macy's five years ago, and squinted at the endless columns of numbers on his monitor.

The setting was the fourth floor of Stern & Bradshaw, a mid-sized accounting firm nestled in the financial district of Chicago. Outside the grimy, double-paned window, the Windy City lived up to its name, a blustery, gray January day swirling around the towering skyscrapers. Inside, however, the atmosphere was one of stagnant air and barely-concealed desperation.
