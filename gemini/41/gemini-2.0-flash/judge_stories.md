## Story Opening:

The gavel echoed, a sharp crack against the worn oak of the bench, silencing the murmurs that had begun to creep through the courtroom. Judge Annelise Beatrice Thorne, a woman whose presence filled the space with a quiet authority, adjusted her glasses and surveyed the room. Her gaze, sharp and intelligent behind the thin, gold frames, settled on the nervous figure hunched at the defendantâ€™s table. 

"Mr. Henderson," she said, her voice a low, clear contralto that carried easily to the back of the room. "Are we ready to proceed?"

Before the defense lawyer could stammer a response, a low thrumming vibration resonated through the floorboards, a sound that quickly escalated into a jarring, rhythmic pulse. The lights flickered, casting dancing shadows across the portraits of past judges that adorned the courtroom walls. A collective gasp rippled through the gallery. Judge Thorne, her brow furrowed in concentration, gripped the edge of the bench. This wasn't a power surge. This was something...else.

## Setting:

The story takes place in the **Edgewater County Courthouse**, located in the fictional town of Oakhaven, Maine. Oakhaven is a small, picturesque town nestled on the coast, its economy reliant on tourism and fishing. The courthouse itself is a grand, neo-classical structure, built in the late 19th century. Its white pillars stand in stark contrast to the dark, weathered clapboard houses that surround it.

Inside, the building is a labyrinth of echoing hallways, lined with faded photographs and dusty law books. Courtroom Number One, where Judge Thorne presides, is a large, imposing space with high ceilings, ornate moldings, and tall, arched windows that offer a view of the harbor. The air is thick with the scent of old paper and polished wood, a testament to the decades of legal battles fought within its walls. Despite its age, the courtroom is well-maintained, a point of pride for the town, representing the steadfastness and tradition of justice. However, the unsettling vibration in the opening suggests that something is about to disrupt that carefully preserved equilibrium.
