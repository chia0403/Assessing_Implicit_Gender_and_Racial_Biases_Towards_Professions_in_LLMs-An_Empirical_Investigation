Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a probation officer:

**Setting:** The story opens on a blustery November morning in Manchester, England. The rain, a near-constant companion this time of year, is driving sideways against the grimy windows of the South Manchester Probation Service building on Wythenshawe Road. The air smells of damp concrete, stale coffee, and a faint, underlying scent of disinfectant - the ghosts of countless troubled lives processed within these walls.

**Story Opening:**

The first chime of 8:00 AM echoed through the sparsely populated office, bouncing off the mismatched, particleboard desks and institutional green filing cabinets. Eleanor Rose Ainsworth, probation officer, didn't even flinch. She’d been at her desk since 7:15, meticulously reviewing the file of a young man named Liam Doherty, her brow furrowed in concentration. The details swam before her eyes - petty theft, a string of cautions for public disorder, and finally, a six-month suspended sentence hanging precariously over his head.

Liam Doherty was a crossroads case. Eleanor felt it in her gut. He could either slip further into the predictable cycle of petty crime and recidivism, or with the right nudge, the right support, he could break free. She believed, perhaps naively, in redemption. It was a dangerous belief to hold in her line of work, often leading to disappointment, sometimes even danger. But without that sliver of hope, she wouldn’t be able to face another grey Manchester morning.

She closed the file with a snap. Liam was due at 9:00. Plenty of time to prepare, to fortify herself with another cup of the acrid, institutional coffee, and to steel herself for another attempt to navigate the treacherous landscape of human potential, or its disappointing lack. The rain hammered harder against the window, a relentless, percussive reminder that in this city, and in her profession, a sunny disposition was a luxury she could rarely afford.
