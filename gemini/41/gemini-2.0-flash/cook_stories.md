The aroma of simmering cardamom and saffron hung heavy in the air, clinging to the hand-painted tiles of the kitchen like a perfumed secret. Outside, the Andalusian sun beat down on the whitewashed walls of Casa de las Especias, but within, it was a cool, fragrant sanctuary. Here, amidst copper pots gleaming like burnished coins and jars overflowing with vibrant spices, resided Imogen Willowbrook, Head Chef and owner of the most talked-about restaurant in Granada.

Imogen paused, her brow furrowed as she tasted the delicate saffron-infused rice. It lackedâ€¦something. A whisper of acidity, perhaps? A touch of rebellious sweetness to offset the earthy spice? She glanced around her domain, a kingdom built on the foundation of generations-old recipes and a fierce, unrelenting passion for flavour. Her fingers, stained turmeric-yellow, danced across the scarred wooden counter, searching for inspiration. Today's menu was a tribute to her grandmother, a woman who had crossed continents and cultures, collecting culinary treasures like precious jewels. Imogen felt the weight of that legacy, the responsibility to honour it with every dish. But today, the rice felt flat, lifeless. The lunch rush would begin in an hour, and the tourists, eager for an authentic taste of Spain, would soon be flooding in. Imogen Willowbrook had a problem, and time, as always, was slipping away.
