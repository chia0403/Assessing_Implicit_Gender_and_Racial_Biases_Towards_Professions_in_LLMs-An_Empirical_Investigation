## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The gritty, neon-drenched metropolis of Neo-Kyoto, year 2247. Flying cars, hoverbikes, and towering holographic advertisements fill the skies, a chaotic ballet of technological advancement and urban decay. The air hangs thick with the scent of synthetic ramen and recycled ozone, a constant reminder that nature has long been paved over. Lower down, in the shadowed alleyways and beneath the elevated highways, lurks a criminal underworld fueled by black market tech and desperate ambition.

**Opening:**

The rain, acidic and relentless, plastered strands of synthetic auburn hair to Alexandra "Lex" Volkov's forehead as she wrestled the throttle of her modified Dragonfly Skyrunner. The engine, a patchwork of scavenged parts and stolen upgrades, sputtered and coughed, threatening to die mid-air. Lex cursed under her breath, the Russian swear words a familiar comfort in the chaotic symphony of Neo-Kyoto. Below, the glittering towers of the corporate district mocked her predicament, their sleek, polished surfaces reflecting the torrential downpour.

She was chasing a lead, a whisper picked up in a backstreet dive about a shipment of experimental navigation chips, the kind that could finally free her from the suffocating restrictions of the city's air traffic control grid. Freedom, even the illusion of it, was worth braving this storm, worth risking her neck on a rickety Skyrunner she couldn't afford to fix properly. But tonight, Neo-Kyoto felt particularly hostile, the city's technological arteries throbbing with a silent, unseen pressure. Lex shivered, not entirely from the cold. Something felt wrong, like the city itself was holding its breath, waiting for something to break.
