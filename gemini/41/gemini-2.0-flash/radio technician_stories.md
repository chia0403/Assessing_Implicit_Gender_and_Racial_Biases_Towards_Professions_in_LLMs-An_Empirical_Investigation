The stale smell of ozone and burnt solder hung heavy in the air of the shack, a familiar perfume that usually soothed Elara Maeve O'Connell. Tonight, however, it did little to calm the frantic flutter in her chest. Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the coastal monitoring station, a deafening percussion that threatened to drown out the delicate whine of the oscillators she was trying to coax back to life.

The shack itself was a claustrophobic rectangle perched precariously on the windswept cliffs of Blackwood Bay, Maine. Inside, it was a chaotic symphony of vintage electronics: hulking vacuum tube amplifiers, spools of tangled wire resembling petrified spaghetti, and oscilloscopes that blinked with an almost sentient glow. Elara had inherited the place, and the responsibility of maintaining its vital function as a coastal distress beacon, from her grandfather, a grizzled old radio man who'd spoken to ghosts on the airwaves and sworn the sea whispered secrets only he could understand.

Now, that sea was screaming, and the beacon was stubbornly silent. Elara, her hands stained with grime and a sheen of sweat on her brow, felt a prickle of fear crawl down her spine. The storm was intensifying, and out there, swallowed by the raging darkness, someone might be needing her help.
