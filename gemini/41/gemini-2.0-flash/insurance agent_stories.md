## Story Opening & Setting:

**Opening:**

The smell of stale coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air of Mildred Higgins's waiting room, thicker even than the dust clinging to the artificial ficus tree. Theodore Bartholomew Finch, his name a cruel joke considering his bird-like posture and perpetual stoop, ran a weary hand through his thinning hair, the rhythm a silent mantra of "please, not another one like Mrs. Periwinkle." Heâ€™d just finished explaining to Mrs. Periwinkle, a woman who believed aliens were trying to steal her dentures, why her homeowner's policy didn't cover intergalactic dental theft. He could feel the caffeine withdrawal headache blooming behind his eyes, a relentless pressure mirroring the anxieties of his clients.

A raspy voice croaked from the doorway. "Mr. Finch? You can see me now."

Theodore pasted on his most empathetic smile, the one he'd practiced in the mirror until it looked only marginally strained. He needed this sale, needed it badly. It was either this, or finally succumb to his wife, Agnes's, constant prodding to take a job at the Piggly Wiggly, bagging groceries. The indignity! He straightened his tie, which felt suddenly too tight, and braced himself for whatever financial apocalypse was about to walk through his door.

**Setting:**

Theodore Bartholomew Finch's insurance agency, "Finch Financial Futures," was located in the heart of Harmony Falls, Iowa, a town that hadn't seen any real excitement since the great pie-eating contest of '98. The office itself was a cramped, single-story brick building squeezed between a laundromat and a taxidermist. The faded sign hanging above the door, promising "Security for Your Tomorrow, Today!", was missing a chunk of paint, revealing the rust underneath. Inside, the decor was a symphony of beige and outdated floral patterns. A poster advertising flood insurance, featuring a cartoon Noah's Ark, hung askew on the wall, perpetually threatening to detach itself entirely. The clatter of Mrs. Higgins's ancient typewriter and the low hum of the fluorescent lights were the soundtrack to Theodore's professional life, a constant reminder of the slow, predictable march of time in Harmony Falls. Despite its lack of glamour, the office was Theodore's haven, a place where he could (usually) help people, even if those people mostly needed help understanding why their pet iguana wasn't covered under their renters insurance.
