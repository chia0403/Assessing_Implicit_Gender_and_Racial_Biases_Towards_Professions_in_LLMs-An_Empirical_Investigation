Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a landscaper main character:

**Setting:** The stifling humidity hung heavy in the air of Belle Isle, Michigan, clinging to everything like a damp shroud. It was early morning, just past sunrise, but the air was already thick and buzzing with the drone of cicadas hidden amongst the ancient oaks. The rose garden, usually a riot of color, was subdued, the dew clinging to the velvety petals like reluctant tears. A thin layer of mist still hugged the ground, obscuring the intricate brick pathways that snaked through the manicured beds.

**Story Opening:**

The whine of a leaf blower shattered the morning quiet. Atticus Silas Thorne, his face already slick with sweat, wrestled the cumbersome machine into submission. He swore under his breath, a string of colorful obscenities that wouldn't be out of place in the garden, though unlikely to be appreciated by the ghosts of the Belle Isle Conservancy members who surely still wandered these hallowed grounds. Atticus hated leaf blowers. They were loud, inefficient, and they always seemed to spit back directly into his face. But Mrs. Abernathy, the Head Gardener, was a stickler for pristine pathways, and what Mrs. Abernathy wanted, Mrs. Abernathy got. Today, however, Atticus's mind wasn't on fallen leaves. He was focused on the strange, unsettling feeling that had been gnawing at him since he'd unlocked the gates of the conservatory just an hour earlier. The air feltâ€¦charged, different. And it wasn't just the humidity. There was something else, something unseen, stirring beneath the surface of the meticulously crafted landscape. It sent a shiver crawling down his spine, and Atticus, a man who prided himself on his rational nature and his understanding of the natural world, couldn't quite shake the feeling that he was being watched. And not just by Mrs. Abernathy.
