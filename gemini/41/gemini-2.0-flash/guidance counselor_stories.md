## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights of Northwood High hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack that had become inextricably linked to the tight knot in Eleanor Ruth Peterson's stomach. It was Monday morning, 7:58 AM, two minutes before the first bell, and already her inbox was flashing a scarlet warning. Parent concerns, student drop requests, the ever-present specter of standardized testing looming large – the usual Monday menagerie.

Eleanor sighed, running a hand through her perpetually messy bun. She glanced at the framed quote on her desk, a hopeful pronouncement from Maya Angelou: "Still, I Rise." It usually helped, a tiny beacon in the swirling chaos of her day. Today, however, it felt like a passive-aggressive reminder of all the problems she hadn't yet solved.

The click-clack of heels echoed in the outer office. Mrs. Henderson, the perpetually flustered secretary, poked her head in. "Eleanor, you have a visitor. A… Mr. Silas Thorne. Says he has an emergency." Mrs. Henderson's voice was laced with a curious blend of apprehension and fascination. Silas Thorne? The name didn't ring a bell. Emergency? On a Monday?

Eleanor straightened her cardigan, took a deep breath, and plastered on her most reassuring guidance counselor smile. "Send him in, Mrs. Henderson."
## Setting:

**Northwood High School, a suburban public school in Willow Creek, Ohio.** The school itself is a sprawling brick building, vaguely resembling a penitentiary from the outside. Inside, however, Eleanor has attempted to cultivate a haven of calm in her office, Room 207.

**Room 207 is small but personalized.** The walls are painted a soothing pale green and adorned with motivational posters that are subtly self-aware – encouraging quotes about perseverance alongside cartoon sloths. A comfortable armchair sits beside her desk, strategically positioned to offer a less formal and more inviting space for students in distress. Bookshelves are crammed with everything from college guides to self-help manuals, and a small succulent plant, stubbornly refusing to die, sits on her windowsill. Despite her best efforts, the room always feels slightly overwhelmed by the sheer volume of paperwork that seems to spontaneously generate on her desk. The window looks out onto the football field, currently empty and silent, a stark contrast to the cacophony Eleanor knows will soon erupt during lunch break. The air is always subtly scented with lavender from the diffuser she keeps running, a small attempt to combat the ever-present aroma of stale coffee and teenage anxiety.
