## Story Opening:

The scent of old paper and brewing chamomile tea clung to Beatrice Abigail Finch like a second skin. Outside, the blustery November wind clawed at the leaded-glass windows of the St. Augustine Public Library, a gothic behemoth perched on the edge of the town square. Inside, a quiet hum of contentment permeated the air, a symphony of rustling pages and hushed whispers. Beatrice, surrounded by teetering stacks of returned books, felt a familiar sense of peace settle over her. It was a peace that rarely extended beyond these walls, not since... well, not since she'd found the peculiar symbol etched into the spine of a forgotten tome in the restricted section. A symbol that, in her dreams, now pulsed with a faint, malevolent light.

## Setting:

**St. Augustine Public Library, St. Augustine, Florida, November 2023:**

The library, a towering structure built in the early 1900s, exudes an old-world charm that borders on the intimidating. Its exterior is clad in grey stone, punctuated by arched windows and gargoyles that seem to leer down at passersby. Inside, the main reading room is a vast, high-ceilinged space with towering bookshelves that reach almost to the ornate, hand-painted ceiling. Sunlight, when it breaks through the perpetually cloudy sky, filters through stained-glass panels depicting scenes from Florida history. The air is thick with the comforting aroma of aging paper, leather bindings, and beeswax polish. A network of narrow, winding corridors leads to various sections, including the dimly lit and somewhat neglected "Florida History & Antiquities" section, where Beatrice spends most of her time, and the heavily locked and rarely accessed "Restricted Section," rumored to contain books deemed too fragile, too controversial, or tooâ€¦ *something else entirely.* The atmosphere, especially after dusk, is undeniably eerie, fueled by local legends of restless spirits and forgotten secrets hidden within the library's very foundations.
