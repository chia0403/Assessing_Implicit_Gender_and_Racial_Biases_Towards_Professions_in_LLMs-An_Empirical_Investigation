## Story Opening & Setting:

**Opening:**

The smell of lavender and stale Play-Doh hung thick in the air, a scent that had become synonymous with "Tuesday" for Gwendolyn Anne Fairchild. Tuesdays meant Tiny Titans, the pre-school sensory group she led at the Bright Horizons Clinic, and Tuesdays almost always meant a sensory overload for at least one child. Today, it looked like little Timmy Miller was nearing his breaking point. His lower lip trembled, his fists clenched around a wobbly tower of blocks, and his eyes darted nervously from the glitter-covered glue stick to the boisterous laughter emanating from the parachute game across the room. Gwendolyn knew that practiced calm was the only weapon she had against a meltdown of epic proportions. She slowly crouched beside him, her voice a gentle murmur in the swirling chaos. “Timmy, those blocks are looking very strong. You built a very tall tower. Does it feel… a little wobbly maybe?”

**Setting:**

The scene is the brightly colored, purpose-built sensory room at the Bright Horizons Clinic, a privately funded pediatric rehabilitation center located in the affluent, yet increasingly gentrified, neighborhood of Brookside Heights in Kansas City, Missouri. The room is designed to stimulate and soothe simultaneously. One wall is covered in a textured, climbing wall with soft, padded holds. Another features a bubbling water feature encased in transparent acrylic. A low, padded platform anchors the center of the room, where a colorful parachute lays discarded, momentarily abandoned after a round of boisterous play. Baskets overflow with sensory toys: squishy balls, textured rollers, musical instruments, and containers filled with beans, rice, and sand. Large windows line the south wall, allowing natural light to flood the space, though sheer curtains provide a soft filter when needed. The room, while intended to be therapeutic, often feels like a controlled explosion of color and activity, a constant test of Gwendolyn's patience and skill.
