The clock on the microwave stubbornly flashed 12:00 AM, mocking Amelia Grace Harrison's exhaustion. She pinched the bridge of her nose, the faint scent of microwaved broccoli still clinging to the air. The fluorescent lights of her tiny, rent-controlled apartment in Brooklyn Heights hummed a lonely tune, a soundtrack to her perpetual state of being overworked and under-appreciated. Outside, the city throbbed with a life that seemed lightyears away from her current reality of nutrient breakdowns and patient meal plans.

Amelia, a registered dietician with a master's degree and a heart full of good intentions, slumped against the kitchen counter, the thin linoleum cold against her back. The fridge, plastered with motivational posters she'd diligently created years ago - "Eat the Rainbow!", "Fuel Your Body!", "You Are What You Eat!" - felt more like a judgment now than encouragement. Tonight's patient load had been particularly draining; Mrs. Periwinkle, convinced that a daily dose of crystal healing would cure her diabetes, and Mr. Henderson, who believed kale was a government conspiracy. Amelia sighed. Sometimes, she felt less like a health professional and more like a translator of the absurd. Brooklyn Heights, with its brownstones and cobblestone streets, felt a million miles away from the holistic wellness retreats and juice cleanses she envisioned when she first moved to New York City. Right now, all she wanted was a hot bath, a cup of herbal tea, and a complete and utter silence.
