## The Story Opening:

The chimes above the door of "The Painted Lady" tinkled a cheerful, if slightly jangled, melody as a gust of February wind whipped through the opening, carrying with it the scent of snow and something faintly floral, like a forgotten summer. Inside, amidst the warm glow of vintage Edison bulbs and the rhythmic hum of hair dryers, Seraphina Mae Bellweather sighed, rubbing her temple with the back of a glitter-dusted hand.

It was Valentine's Day eve, and the salon was predictably manic. Brides-to-be with panic in their eyes and veils clutched to their chests flitted about, bridesmaids giggled nervously while getting their nails done, and the general air was thick with the sweet, cloying smell of hairspray and desperation. Seraphina loved the energy, usually. Loved transforming frazzled women into gleaming goddesses, even if just for a few hours. Tonight, however, her own reflection in the oversized antique mirror behind her station looked more like a goblin than a goddess, and she could feel the pressure mounting. Mrs. Higgins, the notoriously difficult socialite with a penchant for demanding champagne and criticizing everything from the humidity levels to the thread count of the towels, was due in ten minutes for a full-body wax. Seraphina closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and reminded herself that she needed the Higgins money. Desperately.

## The Setting:

**The Painted Lady:** A vintage-inspired salon nestled in the heart of Havenwood, a quaint, perpetually snowy town nestled in the Catskill Mountains of upstate New York. The salon occupies a former Victorian-era tea room, its bones still evident in the ornate molding and the delicate floral wallpaper peeking out from behind strategically placed shelving. Seraphina had painstakingly curated the space, blending the old-world charm with modern touches. Mismatched velvet armchairs sat beneath antique chandeliers, and sleek, stainless steel styling stations were positioned in front of ornately framed mirrors. A vintage record player in the corner often spun old jazz records, adding to the cozy and inviting atmosphere.

**Havenwood:** A picture-postcard town known for its charming boutiques, snow-capped mountains, and surprisingly vibrant artistic community. The town thrives on tourism, particularly during the ski season and the summer months when city dwellers flock to the mountains to escape the heat. Despite its idyllic facade, Havenwood held its secrets, its residents a complex mix of generations-old families and newcomers seeking a simpler life. Beneath the surface of warm apple cider and twinkling fairy lights lay whispers of old rivalries, long-buried secrets, and the occasional unexplained happening.
