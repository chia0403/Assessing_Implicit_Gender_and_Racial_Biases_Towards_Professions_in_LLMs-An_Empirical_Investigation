## The Story Opening:

The scent of rain-soaked concrete and cheap cigarettes clung to the air as Amelia Rosalie Hayes, Esquire, stepped out of the District Attorney's office building. Another grueling plea negotiation, another client barely scraping by. She tugged her overcoat tighter around her, the November chill seeping into her bones despite the layers. Judge Thompson's words echoed in her head: "Ms. Hayes, you fight the good fight, but sometimes, the system simplyâ€¦is."

Amelia scoffed, a puff of white mist escaping her lips. "The system," she muttered to herself. A faceless, unyielding entity, designed to grind down the vulnerable, and occasionally, the righteous. She was starting to feel the grind herself. Years of defending the underdog, the lost souls caught in the gears of bureaucracy, had taken its toll. Tonight, the weight felt particularly heavy, a leaden cloak smothering her already flickering optimism.

## The Setting:

The setting is late November in the industrial heart of **Gary, Indiana**. The sky is a perpetual bruised purple, heavy with the promise of more rain. The city, once a booming steel town, is now a patchwork of decaying infrastructure and pockets of revitalized art districts struggling to emerge from the shadows of abandoned factories. 

Amelia's office, Hayes & Associates, is a small, cramped space on the third floor of a brick building overlooking the dormant steel mills. The windows are grimy, offering a bleak view of rusting machinery and overgrown weeds. Inside, stacks of legal briefs threaten to topple from overflowing shelves. The air smells of stale coffee and paper, a testament to long hours and tight budgets. It's a place that reflects the grit and resilience of the city itself, a place where justice is fought for, not freely given. The occasional flicker of a distant streetlight is the only reminder that life, however diminished, still persists in the heart of this forgotten city.
