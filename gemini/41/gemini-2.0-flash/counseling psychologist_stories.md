Okay, here's a story opening and setting, featuring a counseling psychologist:

**Story Opening:**

The aroma of stale coffee clung to the air like a persistent memory, a scent Dr. Eleanor Rose Campbell had grown immune to after fifteen years in the field. It was Tuesday, the day she dedicated to the court-ordered clients, and already the tension was a palpable thing, buzzing in the fluorescent lights and clinging to the worn fabric of the waiting room chairs. She glanced at the clock – 9:58 AM. Just enough time to take one deep breath and brace herself for the onslaught. Her first appointment was with a teenager named Marcus, charged with vandalism, and Eleanor knew from his file that beneath the bravado and anger lay a well of loneliness she was determined to tap. She just hoped he'd let her. Before she could formulate a plan, the buzzer on her desk hummed, announcing Marcus's arrival.

**Setting:**

Dr. Eleanor Rose Campbell's practice occupied the second floor of a somewhat dilapidated brick building in a small, blue-collar town called Harmony Creek. The building itself housed a mix of businesses – a struggling accounting firm, a dusty antique shop, and a surprisingly popular yoga studio – reflecting the town's own disparate attempts at revitalization. Eleanor's office, while small, was her sanctuary. She'd painted the walls a calming shade of sage green and furnished it with comfortable, mismatched furniture acquired from thrift stores and antique shops. A large, framed print of Georgia O'Keeffe's "Poppy" provided a splash of color above the worn leather couch where her patients would sit. A bookshelf overflowing with psychology textbooks, self-help guides, and well-loved novels lined one wall, subtly suggesting both her expertise and her human side. A small desk, usually piled with paperwork and half-empty mugs of coffee, sat in the corner, facing the couch and offering a clear view of the window overlooking the town's main street. While Harmony Creek might not be glamorous, Eleanor had grown fond of its quiet charm, its resilient spirit, and its genuine, if sometimes troubled, people.
