Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a story featuring a bellhop:

**Story Opening:**

The gilded cage that was the Grand Imperial Hotel hummed with a nervous energy. A convention of diamond merchants, all hard angles and suspicious glances, had checked in that morning, filling the lobby with the subtle rustle of expensive fabrics and the barely-audible click of lockable briefcases. For most of the staff, it meant extra tips and a lot of extra work. For **Edgar Alistair Finch**, the newest bellhop, it meant utter, soul-crushing terror.

He clutched the worn edge of his pristine, maroon uniform, the fabric doing little to absorb the nervous sweat blooming on his palms. He'd only been at the Imperial for three weeks, a probationary period that felt more like a trial by fire. He hadn't yet dropped a bag (a feat considered practically miraculous by his colleagues), or spilled a drink, or forgotten a room number. But today, with the eyes of every discerning gemologist in the Western Hemisphere seemingly boring into him, Edgar felt like the perfect storm of ineptitude was about to break. Just then, the head concierge, a woman whose smile could freeze the Sahara, beckoned him forward with a crisp, almost robotic gesture. "Finch," she clipped, her voice a low hum that promised repercussions. "Room 604. Mr. Beaumont. *Careful.*"

**Setting:**

The Grand Imperial Hotel is a relic of a bygone era, a monument to Gilded Age excess and a testament to the enduring allure of old money. Located in the heart of the (fictional) city of Atherton, a metropolis known for its financial district and historical architecture, the hotel occupies an entire city block.

*   **Exterior:** A towering structure of ornate sandstone, the hotel boasts a grand entrance with towering columns, revolving doors of polished brass and glass, and a uniformed doorman who seems to have been carved from granite. A red carpet always lay perfectly in place, daring guests to take a step up and in.
*   **Lobby:** A cathedral of opulence, the lobby is dominated by a soaring, vaulted ceiling adorned with a massive crystal chandelier. Polished marble floors reflect the light, creating a shimmering effect. Antique furniture, meticulously arranged, invites guests to linger, though few ever do. The air is thick with the scent of lilies, beeswax polish, and the faint, lingering aroma of expensive cigars. There is a large concierge desk to one side, and elevators that are just as ornate in their design.
*   **Guest Rooms:** (Specific to Room 604 - Mr. Beaumont's Room): Room 604 is a suite overlooking the city. Large windows are draped in heavy velvet curtains. Inside is antique furniture, and even an indoor fireplace.
*   **Behind the Scenes:** The hidden network of corridors and service elevators buzzes with the energy of the staff, a stark contrast to the serene elegance of the public areas. The bellhop station, tucked away near the service entrance, is a cluttered space where Edgar and his colleagues can relax (or panic) between assignments.
