## The Story Opening:

The scent of beeswax, pressed linen, and a lingering hint of lavender hung heavy in the air of Augustine Finch's atelier. Outside, the London fog, thick as a miser's regret, muffled the clatter of carriages and the cries of street vendors. Augustine, his spectacles perched precariously on his nose, peered through the large window, a frown creasing his brow. He hadnâ€™t seen a decent sunbeam in weeks.

He sighed, turning back to the half-finished waistcoat draped over his antique dressmaker's dummy. Lord Ashworth was due for a fitting tomorrow, and the silk lining, a deep claret, was proving to be a recalcitrant beast. Augustine prided himself on perfection, on the almost imperceptible curve of a seam, the exact fall of a collar. But today, the fabric seemed to mock his efforts, stubbornly refusing to lie flat.

He picked up his shears, the cool metal a small comfort against the rising tide of frustration. It wasn't just the waistcoat, though. A disquiet, a feeling as heavy and oppressive as the fog outside, had settled over him. A premonition, perhaps. Augustine, a man who trusted in the tangible realities of thread and needle, usually dismissed such feelings as the product of too much strong tea. But tonight, the air crackled with a strange energy, a whisper of something unseen and unknown.

He glanced at the clock on the mantelpiece, a delicate thing of porcelain and gilt, ticking away the precious minutes. Seven past eight. Time to lock up and brave the fog. But as he reached for the latch, a sharp rap echoed through the quiet atelier, a rap that sent a shiver crawling down Augustine Finch's spine.

## The Setting:

**Augustine Finch's Atelier, London, 1888.**

The atelier is located on a quiet, respectable street in the Bloomsbury district of London. It occupies the ground floor of a narrow, three-story Georgian building. The exterior is unassuming, painted a muted grey with a single, large window showcasing a carefully arranged display of fabrics, mannequins, and bolts of shimmering silk. A small, hand-painted sign above the door reads: "Augustine Finch, Tailor & Clothier."

Inside, the space is surprisingly spacious, divided into a work area and a small fitting room. The work area is dominated by a large cutting table, cluttered with patterns, scraps of fabric, and sewing tools. Shelves lined with bolts of cloth in every imaginable color and texture reach towards the high ceiling. Antique sewing machines, each meticulously maintained, sit on sturdy wooden tables. The air is thick with the pleasant aromas of the trade: beeswax, pressed linen, and the faint scent of lavender sachets that Augustine keeps tucked amongst the fabrics.

The fitting room is more refined, with plush velvet curtains, a full-length mirror framed in gilded wood, and comfortable chairs for waiting clients. A collection of fashion plates and fabric swatches adorn the walls, showcasing Augustine's previous creations and offering inspiration to potential customers. Despite the meticulous order, the atelier has a warm and inviting atmosphere, a testament to Augustine's skill not only as a tailor but also as a host. He takes pride in creating a space where his clients feel comfortable and confident in his abilities.
