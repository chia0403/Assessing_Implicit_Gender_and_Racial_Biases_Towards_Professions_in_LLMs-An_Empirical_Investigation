The biting wind howled like a banshee through the skeletal branches of the Wyoming cottonwoods, rattling the chrome mirror of Lucille, her trusty Kenworth T680. Inside, bathed in the warm glow of the dash lights, Rosalie Mae Johnson gripped her lukewarm mug of instant coffee a little tighter. Her breath plumed out in front of her, momentarily fogging the already grime-streaked windshield.

The setting was Exit 78 off I-80, a bleak, desolate truck stop called "The Last Chance." It lived up to its name, being the final outpost of civilization for the next hundred miles, a stretch known amongst truckers as "The Devil's Spine." A mangy mutt, ribs visible beneath its matted fur, scavenged for scraps near the overflowing dumpster, its eyes gleaming like chips of coal in the dim light emanating from the greasy spoon diner. The only other signs of life were a handful of 18-wheelers huddled together, their drivers likely huddled inside trying to catch a few winks before tackling the treacherous mountain pass ahead. The air smelled of diesel, stale coffee, and the faint, lingering scent of fryer grease. Rosalie shuddered. She hated this place. It always felt like the edge of the world, the place where dreams went to die and loneliness took root. And tonight, with the wind screaming its mournful song, that feeling was amplified tenfold.
