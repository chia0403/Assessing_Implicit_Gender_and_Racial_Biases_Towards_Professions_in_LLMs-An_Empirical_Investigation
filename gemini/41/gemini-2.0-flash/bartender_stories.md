Okay, here's a story opening with a setting and a bartender main character named:

**Story Opening & Setting:**

The humid New Orleans night clung to the air like Spanish moss, thick and suffocating. Cicadas whirred a relentless symphony outside, a soundtrack to the clinking glasses and murmurs that filled "The Gilded Lily," a dimly lit bar nestled in the French Quarter's shadowed heart.  Inside, the air was a heady mix of spilled bourbon, stale perfume, and the sweet decay of forgotten dreams.  Heavy velvet curtains muffled the street noise, creating a refuge, or perhaps a gilded cage, depending on your perspective.  Rain streaked down the ornate windows, blurring the already hazy gaslight that flickered above the mahogany bar, casting long, dancing shadows across the room.

**Julian Devereux**, his crisp white shirt a stark contrast to the bar's gloom, polished a glass with practiced ease, his movements fluid and almost hypnotic. He knew this bar like the back of his hand, every crack in the wood, every ghost whispering in the corner. He'd been its keeper, its confessor, its silent observer for the better part of a decade, and tonight felt no different: the same faces, the same sins, the same thirst for oblivion, or perhaps just a damn good Sazerac. But something in the air, a subtle shift in the energy that hummed beneath the surface, told him tonight was going to be anything but ordinary. The clinking of the bell above the door punctuated his thoughts.
