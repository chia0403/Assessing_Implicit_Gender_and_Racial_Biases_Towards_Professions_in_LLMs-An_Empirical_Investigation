**Opening:**

The stale coffee did little to cut through the bone-deep chill that had settled within Dr. Alistair James Finch ever since he'd crossed the threshold of the Blackwood Correctional Facility. The fluorescent lights hummed a discordant tune, mirroring the anxiety thrumming in his chest. He adjusted his tie, a nervous tic he hadn't managed to shake even after years of interviewing the monsters society preferred to forget. Today's interview was different, though. The file sitting on the scarred metal table between him and the soon-to-be-interviewed was thicker than most, filled with grainy crime scene photos and chilling witness statements that seemed to whisper of somethingâ€¦ darker than simple depravity. He hoped, for his own sanity, that he was wrong. He truly did.

**Setting:**

The Blackwood Correctional Facility, located in the remote, fog-shrouded hills of Western Pennsylvania, was a place designed to break spirits. Built in the late 19th century, its imposing gothic architecture cast long, ominous shadows across the exercise yard. The interior was a maze of sterile corridors, painted a depressing shade of institutional green. The air hung heavy with the odors of disinfectant, despair, and something vaguely metallic, a constant reminder of the violence contained within its walls. The interview rooms, small and windowless, were stark and utilitarian, furnished with only a metal table bolted to the floor and two equally unyielding chairs. The silence within these rooms was often more terrifying than the screams that echoed from the cell blocks. It was in this claustrophobic, soul-crushing environment that Dr. Alistair James Finch earned his living, delving into the minds of the incarcerated, searching for answers in the abyss.
