## Story Opening:

The cheap jazz clinging to the smoke-filled air of the Rusty Nail did little to soothe the gnawing emptiness in Theodore "Teddy" Hawthorne's stomach. He nursed the last dregs of his rye, the amber liquid mirroring the dim, flickering gaslight spilling onto the bar. Outside, the November rain beat a relentless tattoo against the grimy windows, a rhythm as insistent and unwelcome as the memory of his last case. A cheating spouse, a staged robbery, the usual parade of pathetic anxieties that paid the bills but offered no satisfaction. Teddy Hawthorne, Private Investigator, was starting to feel like little more than a glorified marriage counselor with a drinking problem.

He was just about to signal for another when a woman materialized beside him, a ghost in a fur stole. Her perfume, something heavy and floral, cut through the stale beer and cigarette smoke like a sharp note in a discordant melody. Without a word, she slid a worn photograph across the sticky surface of the bar. It was a faded image of a young woman with a radiant smile and eyes that held the promise of a life fully lived. A life, Teddy suspected, that had been tragically cut short.

He looked up, his gaze meeting the woman's. They were the color of a stormy sea, filled with a grief that threatened to drown him. He knew, even before she spoke, that his quiet night was about to become a lot louder.

## Setting:

**1947, Chicago, Illinois.** The city, a sprawling beast of brick and steel, was still scarred from the war, but brimming with a restless energy. The air crackled with ambition, corruption, and the lingering echoes of the Roaring Twenties. The South Side, where the Rusty Nail was nestled between a pawn shop and a boarding house, was a melting pot of ethnicities and anxieties. Jazz clubs pulsed with life, while alleyways whispered secrets. Shadows stretched long and deep in the city's canyons, providing ample cover for both the desperate and the dangerous. This was Teddy Hawthorne's hunting ground, a city that offered a constant stream of cases, and an even more constant stream of opportunities to lose himself in the bottom of a glass.
