## Story Opening and Setting:

**Opening:**

The scent of menthol rub and stale coffee hung heavy in the air, clinging to the worn vinyl of the treatment tables. Eleanor Mae Harding sighed, her own shoulders aching from the morning's onslaught of frozen shoulders and balky knees. Outside, the relentless Miami sun beat down on the parking lot, turning asphalt into a shimmering mirage. Inside, she was wrestling with Mrs. Rodriguez's resistance to even the simplest abduction exercise.

"Come on, Mrs. Rodriguez, just a little higher. You're stronger than you think." Eleanor's voice was a carefully constructed blend of encouragement and authority, a skill honed over years of coaxing movement from reluctant muscles. Mrs. Rodriguez, a tiny woman with a formidable glare, grunted and shook her head.

"It burns, Eleanor! Like fire!"

Eleanor pinched the bridge of her nose, fighting the urge to roll her eyes. It was always the same. Progress, then protest. A little give, then a wall of resistance built of fear and pain. It was the constant dance of physical therapy, a tango between healing and hurt. She just hoped, today, she could lead.

**Setting:**

Eleanor Mae Harding practices physical therapy at "Motion & Balance," a small, independently-owned clinic nestled in a bustling strip mall in Little Havana, Miami. The clinic itself is a testament to functional frugality. The walls are painted a calming, if slightly faded, shade of seafoam green. The equipment is well-used, showing the wear and tear of years of service, but meticulously maintained. There's a cramped waiting area with mismatched chairs and a perpetually out-of-date stack of magazines. In the back, a larger, open space serves as the treatment area, divided into individual stations with curtains for privacy. The air conditioning works overtime to combat the Miami heat, but struggles to keep up, leaving a lingering humidity that clings to everything. The sounds of Cuban music drifting in from the nearby bakery often mingle with the moans and groans of patients, creating a uniquely Miami soundtrack to Eleanor's daily grind. It's not glamorous, but it's home, and within these walls, Eleanor fights tirelessly to restore movement and hope to those who need it most.
