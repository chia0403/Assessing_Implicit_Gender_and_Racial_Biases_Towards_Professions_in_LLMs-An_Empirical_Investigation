## Story Opening:

The incessant drumming in Miles Christopher Hawthorne's ear wasn't the pounding of a thousand trades being executed on the floor below. It was the goddamn rhythmic throb of a vein in his temple, a persistent little reminder that he was pushing forty, drinking too much espresso, and living a life increasingly devoid of anything resembling peace.

He squinted at the triple monitors, the flickering green and red numbers blurring into an abstract, nauseating painting. Another sell-off in the tech sector. Predictable. He should have seen it coming, hedged his clients' positions. He'd been distracted, thinking about his daughter's upcoming school play, picturing her as a shimmering, slightly awkward fairy princess. Distracted and, if he was being honest with himself, increasingly jaded.

Miles took a long swig from his lukewarm coffee, the bitter taste doing little to dispel the creeping feeling of existential dread. Heâ€™d made millions for his clients, and a comfortable fortune for himself. He lived in a sprawling loft overlooking Central Park, drove a vintage Porsche, and owned a ludicrously expensive collection of first edition Hemingway. But none of it seemed to fill the void. The numbers on the screen were just that: numbers. Empty, hollow, meaningless.

He felt a tap on his shoulder. "Hawthorne," a voice boomed, cutting through the cacophony of the trading floor. "Mr. Albright to see you. Says it's urgent."

Miles sighed. Albright. Just what he needed.

## Setting:

Miles Christopher Hawthorne's office, a corner suite on the 37th floor of the prestigious Hawthorne & Finch brokerage firm in Midtown Manhattan. Floor-to-ceiling windows offered a breathtaking view of Central Park, a verdant oasis in the concrete jungle. The decor was a carefully curated blend of power and understated elegance: a minimalist desk crafted from reclaimed wood, a leather Eames chair, and a collection of modern art prints chosen more for their investment value than their aesthetic appeal. The constant hum of servers and the frantic shouting from the trading floor permeated the space, a constant reminder of the frenetic energy that fueled Miles's existence. Despite the luxurious surroundings, there was an undeniable air of sterile efficiency about the room, a place where money was worshipped and emotions were kept strictly in check. The smell of burnt coffee and expensive cologne hung heavy in the air, a peculiar and pervasive aroma that Miles had long since ceased to notice.
