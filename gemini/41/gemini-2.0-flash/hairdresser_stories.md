Okay, here's a story opening and setting with a main character who is a hairdresser:

**Opening:**

The bell above the door of "Shear Bliss" chimed with a bright, tinkling optimism that felt jarringly out of sync with Beatrice “Bea” Bellweather’s mood. It was a Tuesday morning, typically a slow day, and Bea was already wrestling with a particularly stubborn clump of hairspray residue clinging to her favorite pair of shears. She hadn't even had her second cup of Earl Grey.

"Morning, Bea!" chirped Mrs. Periwinkle, her voice a little too loud, her floral scarf a little too vibrant. Bea forced a smile, tucking a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear.

"Morning, Mrs. Periwinkle," she replied, carefully not letting her irritation show. "What can I do for you today?"

Mrs. Periwinkle beamed, clutching her purse to her chest. "Oh, just the usual, dear. A trim and a chat. You always know how to make a girl feel better, Bea."

Bea doubted that this morning. She felt like everything was going wrong. She took a deep breath and told herself to focus. This was her job, and she was good at it. She guided Mrs. Periwinkle towards her usual station, a worn but comfortable swivel chair near the large front window. As Mrs. Periwinkle began to regale her with the latest gossip from the gardening club, Bea couldn't shake the feeling that today was going to be anything but ordinary.

**Setting:**

"Shear Bliss" was a cozy, albeit slightly cluttered, salon nestled on a quiet side street in the charming coastal town of Port Blossom, Maine. The building itself was an old Victorian house, painted a cheerful, slightly faded, periwinkle blue (ironically, Mrs. Periwinkle had no input on the colour choice when Bea first opened the shop 5 years ago).

Inside, the salon was a riot of pastel colors and floral prints. Sunlight streamed through the large front window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. The walls were adorned with framed vintage hair advertisements and Bea's amateur watercolors of local landscapes.

Four styling stations lined one side of the room, each equipped with a well-worn leather chair, a mirror, and a trolley overflowing with combs, brushes, and an impressive array of styling products. The air hung thick with the scent of hairspray, perm solution, and Bea's signature lavender essential oil diffuser. In the back, a small, brightly lit room served as a washing station and color mixing area. A vintage radio, usually tuned to a classical music station, sat on a shelf near the coffee machine, which was always brewing, and the kettle for tea was always hot. The overall atmosphere was one of warmth, familiarity, and a touch of organized chaos. It was Bea's sanctuary, and for many of Port Blossom's residents, it was also a place of solace and connection.
