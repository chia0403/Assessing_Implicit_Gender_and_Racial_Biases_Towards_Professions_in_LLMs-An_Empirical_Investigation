The fluorescent lights of the "Apex Architectural Associates" office hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia Nightingale's life.  Her beige cardigan, inexplicably itchy today, felt like a second skin against the sterile backdrop of the waiting room.  Rows of uncomfortable chairs, identical in their dull grey and unwavering support, faced a reception desk that seemed to absorb all the light.  Amelia, with her perpetually tired eyes and a hair-tied, precisely placed bun, was the silent sentinel guarding this architectural purgatory.  Each creak of the floorboards, each whispered conversation from the hushed conversations happening behind the thick glass doors echoed in the small, sterile space.  The air, thick with the scent of stale coffee and the subtle, metallic tang of fear (a peculiar trait of architectural designs that never quite seemed to meet their clientsâ€™ expectations), hung heavy in the air.  Today, a particularly imposing man in a charcoal suit, with an air of quiet menace, sat waiting.  He was a formidable figure, a testament to the weight of unspoken demands and deadlines. The ticking clock on the wall seemed to chime with the pounding of Amelia's own heart.
