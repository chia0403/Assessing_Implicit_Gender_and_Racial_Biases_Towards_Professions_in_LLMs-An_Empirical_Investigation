The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's threadbare scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks like a thousand tiny needles.  The air, thick with the smell of pine needles and damp earth, hung heavy over the Whispering Woods, a place where the very trees seemed to hold their breath.  It was early December, the kind of day that painted the sky in bruised purples and angry grays, and Amelia, Animal Caretaker of the Blackwood Preserve, knew this was no ordinary chill.  A shiver, deeper than the wind's touch, ran down her spine.

The Preserve, a sprawling tract of land nestled within the heart of the woods, was a sanctuary for creatures both large and small.  Towering pines, their branches gnarled and twisted by centuries of storms, formed a labyrinthine canopy overhead.  Beneath, moss-covered rocks hid secret springs, and sun-drenched meadows offered refuge to deer, rabbits, and a multitude of birds.  But today, a preternatural silence hung in the air, a silence broken only by the rustling of unseen creatures and the rhythmic drip, drip, drip of water from unseen ledges.  This sense of unnatural quiet was almost as unnerving as the persistent chill.  Amelia's worn leather boots crunched on fallen leaves as she trudged through the overgrown path, her flashlight beam cutting through the gloom, searching for any sign of disturbance.  The Blackwood family had entrusted her with the well-being of these creatures, and the responsibility weighed heavily on her shoulders.
