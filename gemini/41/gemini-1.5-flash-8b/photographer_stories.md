The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Em"  Montgomery's camera bag around her legs, rattling the lenses like impatient teeth.  Grey clouds, thick as a fog-shrouded shroud, hung low over the jagged peaks of the Wallowa Mountains, mirroring the gloom settling in Em's heart.  Dust devils danced across the barren, windswept plateau, swirling the fallen leaves into a chaotic ballet of ochre and brown.  She was far from the vibrant, bustling city of Portland, a place she'd left behind with a mix of exhilaration and dread.  Here, amidst the stark beauty of the eastern Oregon high desert, lay the subject of her latest assignment â€“ a forgotten homestead, its weathered timbers clawing at the sky like skeletal fingers.  The abandoned cabin, known locally as the "Windswept Widow," was a place whispered about in hushed tones, a nexus of local legend and long-lost sorrow.  Em, a photographer with a reputation for capturing the subtle shifts in human emotion, felt the pull of the unknown, a siren song tempting her to unravel the stories buried beneath the dust and silence.
