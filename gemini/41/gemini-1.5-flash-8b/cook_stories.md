The clatter of pots and pans, a symphony of sizzling bacon and sputtering oil, filled the air of "The Rusty Spoon," a greasy spoon diner nestled in the shadow of the crumbling, gothic spire of St. Jude's Church.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, mimicking the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Amelia Blackwood's heart.  Amelia, a culinary artist with a perpetually flour-dusted apron and eyes that held the wisdom of a thousand simmering soups, was in a foul mood.  Not a bad mood, exactly, but one thick with the despair of a plate of undercooked potatoes.  Today's breakfast rush had been brutal.  Lines snaked out the door, the smell of stale coffee and burnt toast hanging heavy in the air.  The chipped Formica counter was littered with sticky cups and half-eaten biscuits.  Amelia, however, was more concerned with the small, almost imperceptible tremor beneath her feet.  The ancient diner, built on the foundations of a forgotten carriage depot, seemed to vibrate with a nervous energy.
