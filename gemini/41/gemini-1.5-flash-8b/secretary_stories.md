The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Blackwood's hands, a meager comfort against the biting November wind whistling through the gaps in the boarded-up windows of the old Victorian building.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sun slicing through the gloom of the  "Grand Haven" offices, illuminating a layer of forgotten paperwork scattered across Amelia's cluttered desk.  Her fingers, stained a faded ochre from years of handling old legal documents, traced the worn edges of a faded contract.  1887.  It felt like a lifetime ago.

The office, once a hub of bustling activity, now echoed with the ghosts of its former glory.  The high ceilings, once adorned with elaborate chandeliers, were bare save for a single, flickering gaslight.  Musty smells of aged leather and decaying wood hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint scent of Amelia's lavender-scented hand lotion.  Cobwebs draped like macabre tapestries from every corner, silently observing the quiet solitude of the secretary.  A single, dusty typewriter sat on a rickety table, its keys dulled and unresponsive. The only sound other than the wind outside was the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock in the hall, a melancholy counterpoint to the accumulating silence.
