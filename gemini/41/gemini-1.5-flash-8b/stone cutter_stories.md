The biting wind, a relentless sculptor itself, whipped Elias Thorne's cloak around his legs as he clambered up the treacherous incline.  Dust, fine as powdered ash, stung his eyes, swirling with the icy particles that coated the mountainside.  Below, the sprawling city of Aethelgard, a tapestry of gleaming white stone and emerald rooftops, stretched out like a sleeping giant.  He could almost feel the weight of its expectations pressing down on him, a weight he bore, literally, in the form of the heavy mallet clutched in his calloused hand.  Elias was a stone cutter, a whisper of creation in a world built of immutable form.  His work, however, was not merely the fashioning of building blocks; it was the painstaking extraction of stories buried within the mountain itself.


Aethelgard, nestled in a valley carved by an ancient, now-dormant volcano, was a city sculpted from the very heart of the mountain.  Each building, each statue, each intricate spire, spoke of a history etched in stone, a history Elias knew was more complex than the intricate designs he carved each day. The volcanic rock, a deep, obsidian-tinged grey, held secrets within its very pores.  He believed that the stories, the echoes of laughter, tears, and triumphs, were trapped within these rugged slopes, waiting to be released by his chisel.  The mountain, itself a monument to forgotten ages, felt ancient and knowing, watching Elias as he worked, a silent, granite guardian.
