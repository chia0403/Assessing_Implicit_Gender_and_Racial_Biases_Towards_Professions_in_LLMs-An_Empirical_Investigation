The fluorescent lights of Ms. Eleanor Vance's classroom hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the quiet, almost imperceptible, ticking of the clock on the wall.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun filtering through the grimy windowpanes, illuminating a scene of half-empty desks, scattered notebooks, and the faint scent of stale coffee and desperation.  This was Mrs. Vance's tenth period, Advanced Placement Literature, and, as usual, the room felt more like a waiting room than a place of intellectual pursuit.  The rhythmic tapping of a pen on paper was the only sound that broke the low thrumming of the fluorescent lights, and that was coming from the only student remaining in the room, a lanky figure hunched over a worn copy of "Hamlet."  A single, flickering, almost-invisible lightbulb hung precariously above him.  Outside, the world, a riot of autumn colors and rustling leaves, pulsed with a life the classroom seemed to have almost forgotten.
