The fluorescent hum of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office was a constant, almost oppressive, soundtrack to her life.  Sunlight, fractured and pale, struggled to pierce the grime-coated windows of the small, three-story building on the edge of the impoverished district of Ashwood.  Eleanor, a dentist with a practice that had outlived its prime, stared at the chipped porcelain sink, the chipped paint of the walls a mirrored reflection of the worn enamel on her own teeth.  Today, the usual low hum of the drill and the muted whispers of anxious patients seemed absent, replaced by an unsettling quiet.  A single, fat raindrop, the prelude to a torrential downpour, splattered against the window, a stark counterpoint to the stifling stillness inside.

The clinic, tucked between a pawn shop and a dilapidated bakery, had been her life, her sanctuary, and her prison for the past twenty years.  The air hung heavy with the scent of antiseptic and despair.  Each morning, as she opened the heavy door, she was met by the same muted colours â€“ shades of gray, rust, and the muted greens of the sickly plants that clung precariously to life in the window boxes. The constant, hushed whispers of the streets, echoing the low groans of the patients, were the familiar sounds of Ashwood.  This was her world, a world where the teeth of poverty were as prevalent as the decay they often hid.
