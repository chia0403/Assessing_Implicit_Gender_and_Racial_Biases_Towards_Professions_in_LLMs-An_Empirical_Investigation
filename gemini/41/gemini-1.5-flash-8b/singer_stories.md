The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the cobblestones of  Old Southwark, London, 1888.  Rain, a relentless, icy sheet, hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the "Golden Harp" music hall, mimicking the frantic rhythm Amelia Nightingaleâ€™s heart pounded against her ribs.  Tonight, Amelia Nightingale, renowned soprano, was to perform her most ambitious piece yet: a new composition, "The Raven's Lament," commissioned by the enigmatic Lord Ashworth.  The hall, usually vibrant with the buzz of anticipation and the clinking of tankards, was unusually quiet, the air thick with the unspoken tension hanging over the hushed crowd.  Amelia, her breath fogging in the damp air, adjusted the velvet ribbon on her throat, the weight of expectation pressing down on her like the leaden sky itself.  She knew that her performance tonight would either solidify her reputation or shatter it beyond repair.
