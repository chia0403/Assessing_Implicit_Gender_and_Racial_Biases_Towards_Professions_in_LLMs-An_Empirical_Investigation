The flickering neon sign of "Flooded Fixtures" cast a sickly yellow glow on Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's rain-slicked trench coat.  The alley reeked of damp earth and something vaguely floral, probably a particularly pungent variety of overflowing flowerbed from one of the nearby Victorian mansions.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron walls, a relentless percussion against the already-bubbling anxiety in Barty's chest.  He was late.  Again.  His watch, a battered, leather-wrapped antique, ticked with a disconcerting urgency against the backdrop of the downpour.  Tonight, the client wasn't some grumpy old widow with a stubborn drain; it was Lady Beatrice Blackwood, a notorious collector of antique porcelain dolls and a woman whose wrath was legendary in the upper echelons of Ashwood.  Barty swallowed, the metallic taste of fear coating his tongue.  He hoped his tools were sharp enough to silence her ire.  The narrow, cobblestone alley was the heart of Ashwood's hidden underbelly, a labyrinth of forgotten passages and backyards, a place where the city's glittering facade crumbled into grime and shadows.  Barty, the city's most unlikely hero, had to navigate this maze, hoping his pipes and his patience could weather the storm brewing inside the grand Blackwood Manor.
