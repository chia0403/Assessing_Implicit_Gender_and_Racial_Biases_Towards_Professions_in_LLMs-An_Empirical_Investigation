The flickering fluorescent lights of the abandoned factory hummed a mournful tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic thump of Amelia Blackwood's boots on the cracked concrete floor.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom, illuminating a maze of rusted pipes and tangled wires.  Amelia, a wiry woman with calloused hands and eyes that seemed to absorb the darkness, felt a familiar prickle of unease. This wasn't just any old electrical job; this was the Blackwood family estate, a place steeped in history – and whispers.

**Setting:**  The Blackwood family estate, a sprawling, dilapidated factory on the outskirts of a small, forgotten town.  Time has taken its toll on the once-grand building, its towering brick walls scarred with graffiti and ivy, and the inside filled with the remnants of forgotten machinery. Rain streaks the windows, and a persistent chill permeates the air, despite the industrial heat emanating from some of the exposed wiring.  Old blueprints, yellowed and brittle, scattered on a nearby workbench, offered clues to the factory’s original purpose. The smell of damp earth and something vaguely metallic clung to the air, making the silence almost oppressive.
