The fluorescent hum of the pharmacy, a sterile symphony of white and muted beige, vibrated against Amelia Nightingale’s temples.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sun slicing through the grimy windows of "Apothecary's Choice," a fixture on Elm Street for generations.  The scent of antiseptic mingled with the faint, cloying aroma of lilies, a floral tribute left by a recent grieving family.  Amelia, a pharmacist with eyes the colour of faded amethyst, meticulously labelled a jar of lavender balm, her fingers, stained a faint ochre from years of handling herbs, moving with practiced grace.  Outside, the city thrummed with its usual cacophony – a symphony of sirens, car horns, and the distant rumble of the subway.  Inside, the clock ticked, an almost imperceptible beat in the quiet hum of the shop, marking the relentless passage of time, a time Amelia felt she was increasingly losing track of.  Today, the usual rhythm of prescriptions and consultations felt strained, discordant.
