The fluorescent lights of the "Everything You Need, and More" department store hummed, a monotonous counterpoint to the clatter of Amelia "Amy" Carmichael's high heels against the polished linoleum floor.  Amy, a salesperson in the home d√©cor section, surveyed the rows of meticulously arranged vases, candleholders, and throw pillows.  The air, thick with the synthetic scent of pine and freshly-waxed wood, felt suffocating.  It was a Tuesday afternoon, the slowest part of the week, and the only sounds apart from the hum of the lights and the occasional rustle of a shopper's purse were the rhythmic clicks of Amy's pen as she meticulously tracked inventory on her tablet.


The store, a sprawling behemoth in the heart of the burgeoning suburban sprawl, was a monument to consumerism.  Giant windows showcased meticulously arranged living rooms and bedrooms that resembled staged photo shoots more than realistic dwellings.  Rows of shoppers, mostly in muted shades of beige and grey, drifted through the aisles, their expressions ranging from bored indifference to outright frustration. Amy felt the familiar pang of ennui, a constant companion in this sterile environment.  She longed for something more, something beyond the predictable routines and manufactured smiles.
