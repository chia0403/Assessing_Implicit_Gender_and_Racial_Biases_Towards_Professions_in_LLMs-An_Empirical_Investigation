Professor Elara Vance, a woman whose tweed jacket seemed perpetually dusted with the faintest whisper of academic ash, stared out the panoramic window of her office at the swirling grey clouds gathering over the Peak District.  The air in the meticulously organised study, smelling faintly of aged parchment and pipe tobacco, crackled with the unspoken tension of a brewing storm.  Rain lashed against the glass, mirroring the tempest brewing within her.  It had been three weeks since the anonymous package arrived, containing only a single, faded photograph, and the image had haunted her ever since.

Her office, situated on the top floor of the crumbling but grand University of Sheffield building, overlooked a cobbled courtyard.  Sunlight, fractured by the clouds, cast long shadows across the worn stone.  Books, overflowing from towering shelves, lined the walls, creating a labyrinth of knowledge and forgotten secrets.  A fireplace, perpetually overflowing with the remnants of yesterday's lectures and the whispered anxieties of students, cast a comforting but illusory warmth.  The air, thick with the scent of history, seemed to press down on her as she sat, lost in the memory of the image within the photograph.
