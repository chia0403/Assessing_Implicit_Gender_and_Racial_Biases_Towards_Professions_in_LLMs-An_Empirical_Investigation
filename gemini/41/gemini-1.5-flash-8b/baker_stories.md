The biting November wind, a relentless claw, clawed at the shutters of "The Golden Crust," rattling them like bones in a dying fire.  Inside, Amelia  Pendleton, a baker with hands as warm and comforting as freshly-baked sourdough, hunched over the roaring hearth.  Flour dusted her apron, a fine snowdrift clinging to her already-muted grey wool coat.  The aroma of cinnamon, nutmeg, and the faintest whisper of lavender filled the small, cosy bakery, a stark contrast to the icy world outside.  The single flickering gas lamp cast long, dancing shadows across the scrubbed wooden tables and the rows of glistening pastries displayed in the display cases.  A lone figure, huddled in a corner booth, nursed a steaming mug of spiced cider, lost in thought.  Amelia, though, felt the world pressing in, a tangible weight against her broad shoulders.  The coming winter promised to be harsh.  And with it, a debt that felt heavier than any snowfall.
