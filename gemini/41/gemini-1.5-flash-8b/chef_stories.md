The air in Le Coq d'Or hung thick with the scent of thyme, roasting garlic, and something faintly metallic, a telltale sign of the impending disaster.  Chef Antoine Dubois, a man whose face, usually a roadmap of meticulous calculations, was now etched with a furious concentration, slammed a perfectly formed quenelle of foie gras against the polished marble countertop.  The sound echoed strangely in the otherwise hushed kitchen.  The clock above the pass-through window ticked, each second a metronome counting down to a crescendo of chaos.

Antoine, dressed in his pristine white chef's uniform, felt a familiar knot tighten in his stomach. Tonight was the grand tasting for the new Michelin star.  Months of tireless work, sacrifices made, and countless hours spent refining his signature dish, the "Étoile de la Nuit," now hung in the balance.  The restaurant, Le Coq d'Or, a beacon of culinary excellence perched atop the bustling Rue de la République in Paris, was his life. It was where he'd poured his heart and soul for the past twenty years, and now, everything rested on the next few hours.
