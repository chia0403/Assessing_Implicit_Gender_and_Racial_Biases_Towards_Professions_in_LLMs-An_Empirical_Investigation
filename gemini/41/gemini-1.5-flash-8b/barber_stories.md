The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the chipped linoleum floor of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's barbershop, "The Clipper's Cut."  Dust motes danced in the single beam of light slicing through the gloom, illuminating a swirl of faded crimson paint on the walls.  The scent of beeswax, old leather, and something faintly sweet – perhaps overripe fruit – hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to the regulars who frequented the shop tucked away on the backstreet of Oakhaven.  Barty himself, a man whose weathered face bore the marks of countless shorn heads and whispered secrets, leaned into his work.  His practiced hands, stained with the indelible hues of faded mahogany and midnight black, deftly guided the razor across a particularly stubborn beard.  A rhythmic "snip-snip-snip" echoed through the otherwise silent space, a familiar lullaby in the small, forgotten corner of the city.
