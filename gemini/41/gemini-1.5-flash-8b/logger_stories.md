The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's crimson flannel shirt around her, stinging her cheeks with icy needles.  Sunlight, fractured and weak, barely pierced the dense canopy of the Redwood National Forest.  Emerald green, almost unnatural in its deepness, pressed in on her as she hacked away at the gnarled trunk of a centuries-old Coast Redwood.  Amelia, a logger with hands like polished bronze and eyes the colour of a stormy sea, worked with a focused fury, the rhythmic clang of her axe a counterpoint to the mournful cries of unseen birds.  The air hung heavy with the scent of pine and damp earth, a potent perfume that clung to her clothes, her skin, and the very air she breathed.

The setting was the heart of the Redwood National Park, a realm of towering giants stretching towards the heavens.  Deep within the ancient forest, miles from any sign of civilization, lay the Blackwood logging camp.  A collection of rough-hewn cabins, their paint peeling and faded, huddled together like weary travellers.  Smoke curled lazily from the chimney of the cookhouse, promising the lingering smell of sawdust and roasted coffee, a familiar comfort amidst the relentless rhythm of the forest's pulse. Amelia, daughter of a renowned logger and raised amongst the towering redwoods, was intimately familiar with the forest's every whisper, every tremor, every secret held within its ancient embrace.  The forest, to her, was not a resource to be exploited, but a kindred spirit, a force that demanded respect and understanding.
