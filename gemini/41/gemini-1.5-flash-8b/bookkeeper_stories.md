The fluorescent lights of the "Numbers & Nuggets" accounting firm hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Butterfield's life.

Amelia's desk, a bastion of order amidst the chaos, boasted a miniature bonsai tree, a chipped ceramic mug overflowing with lukewarm chamomile tea, and a stack of tax forms that seemed to defy gravity.  A small, framed photograph of her dog, a scruffy terrier named Pip, sat on a pile of receipts, a constant reminder of the world outside the sterile confines of the office.  It was a typical Tuesday, a microcosm of a life that was, for the moment, undeniably ordinary.  But something about this particular Tuesday felt different, disturbingly so.
