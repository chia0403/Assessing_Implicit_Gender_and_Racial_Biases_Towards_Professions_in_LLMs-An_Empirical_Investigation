The fluorescent lights of the Tiny Tots Daycare hummed, a monotonous drone that seeped into Amelia Blackwood's very bones.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sunbeams slicing through the grime-streaked windows, illuminating the kaleidoscope of colours splashed across the walls â€“ rainbow-themed murals that, frankly, were losing their vibrancy.  Amelia, a young woman with eyes the colour of stormy seas and a perpetually tired smile, checked the nap schedule for the toddlers.  Another day, another battle against the relentless sleepiness, the inevitable tantrums, the ceaseless demands of tiny humans.  Today, however, felt different.  A prickle of unease, a feeling she couldn't quite place, ran through her.  The day started uneventfully, until the arrival of a new baby.  Small, wrapped tightly in a pristine, lavender-coloured blanket, the tiny figure seemed to radiate a stillness that both intrigued and unsettled Amelia.  The baby, she learned, was named Elara.
