The biting wind, a relentless harbinger of winter, whipped across the desolate expanse of Interstate 80.  Dust devils danced across the cracked asphalt, mimicking the swirling anxieties in  Alistair Finch's stomach.  He, Alistair Finch, highway maintenance worker, squinted against the grey glare, his worn leather gloves clutching the handle of the jackhammer.  The rhythmic clang echoed in the vast, empty landscape, a counterpoint to the mournful howl of the wind.  Today, the icy grip of early January had brought with it a particularly nasty layer of frost, turning the already treacherous stretch of highway into a skating rink.

Setting: A desolate stretch of Interstate 80, somewhere in the high plains of Wyoming.  The highway stretches endlessly, swallowed by the vast, unforgiving expanse of the winter landscape.  Bare, skeletal trees clawed at the leaden sky, their branches etched against the swirling clouds.  A scattering of snow-dusted, abandoned roadside buildings and weathered farmhouses punctuated the landscape, silent witnesses to the relentless passage of time and the harsh beauty of the Wyoming wilderness.
