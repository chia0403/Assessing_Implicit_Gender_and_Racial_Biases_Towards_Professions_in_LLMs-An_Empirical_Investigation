The biting wind whipped Amelia "Milly"  Fitzwilliam's hard hat around her head, stinging her cheeks with icy particles.  The skeletal frame of the new skyscraper, a gleaming steel monument piercing the grey London sky, loomed before her.  She was perched precariously on a narrow beam, high above the city's chaotic ballet of buses and taxis, the rhythmic clang of distant construction machinery a counterpoint to the relentless howl of the wind.  Below, the cobbled streets of London seemed to shrink into miniature models, the people mere ants scurrying about their lives.  It was a familiar perspective, one Milly had stared at a thousand times while assembling the metal and concrete jungle. This time, however, it felt different.  A different kind of chill, a prickling unease, had settled in her bones alongside the cold air.  The rhythmic clinking of steel, usually comforting, now echoed eerily in her ears.


The setting: The sprawling, modern construction site of the "Spire of Progress" skyscraper, nearing completion, high above the historic, bustling streets of central London.  The time is a blustery November afternoon.
