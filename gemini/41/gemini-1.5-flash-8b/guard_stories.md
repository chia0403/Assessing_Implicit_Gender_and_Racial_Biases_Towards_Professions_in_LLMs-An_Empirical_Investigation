The biting wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks, rattling the iron bars of the Blackwood Prison's outer gate.  A pale, bruised dawn painted the sky in shades of grey and sickly yellow, mirroring the bleakness that clung to everything within the walls.  Sergeant Elias Thorne, his breath misting in the frigid air, tightened his grip on the worn leather straps of his duty belt.  The clang of the gate, a metallic sigh against the biting wind, echoed through the silent compound, a jarring counterpoint to the pervasive stillness.  He was the last man awake, the sole sentinel guarding the shadowed approach to the infamous Iron Cell, a place whispered about in hushed tones â€“ a place where even the ravens dared not linger.


Setting: Blackwood Prison, a towering, gothic fortress carved from the jagged peaks of a remote, windswept mountain range.  Its stone walls, stained with the grime of centuries, seem to absorb the light and whisper tales of forgotten prisoners and even more forgotten horrors. The air within the prison is perpetually cold and damp, thick with the scent of mildew and despair.  The prison is isolated, nestled deep in the valley, surrounded by towering peaks that seem to suffocate it.  A perpetual mist often obscures the valley, adding to the prison's already forbidding atmosphere.
