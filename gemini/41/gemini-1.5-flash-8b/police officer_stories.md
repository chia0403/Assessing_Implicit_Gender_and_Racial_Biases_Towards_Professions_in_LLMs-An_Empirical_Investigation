Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the precinct, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic rhythm in Detective Isabella "Izzy" Diaz's head.  The air in the cramped interrogation room hung thick with the smell of stale coffee and fear.  Outside, the neon glow of the city, usually a vibrant tapestry of light, seemed muted, washed out by the downpour.  This was Precinct 32, a forgotten corner of the sprawling metropolis, a place where shadows stretched long and the ghosts of unsolved cases clung to the walls like damp laundry.  Izzy, a veteran of the force with a perpetually weary gaze and a sharp, almost predatory, instinct, traced the chipped paint on the interrogation table with the tip of her pen.  Tonight, her quarry was a young man named Marcus Hayes, a promising but troubled artist, suspected of a crime that left a trail of unanswered questions.  She needed answers, answers that were as elusive as the city's rain-slicked streets.
