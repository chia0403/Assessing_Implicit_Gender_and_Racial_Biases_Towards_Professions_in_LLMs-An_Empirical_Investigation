Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the antique shop, a frantic percussion mirroring the frantic rhythm of Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's thoughts.  The scent of damp earth and aged paper hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the designer perfumes and polished hardwood floors Amy usually navigated in her high-end real estate dealings.  She was supposed to be viewing a potential listing – a sprawling Victorian mansion on the outskirts of Blackwood, rumored to be haunted – but the antique shop, tucked away on a side street, held her captive.  It was here, amidst the chipped porcelain dolls and tarnished silver tea sets, that she felt the faintest tremor of doubt.

The setting: Blackwood, a town nestled deep within the rolling hills of the Appalachian Mountains, shrouded in a perpetual twilight.  It wasn't the picturesque charm of a postcard town, but an alluring, almost brooding, beauty.  Victorian architecture dominated the landscape, crumbling brick and stained glass windows whispering tales of a bygone era.  The air carried a whisper of secrets, carried on the wind that whistled through the gaps in the weathered houses.  Blackwood wasn't a place for fleeting smiles and quick deals; it was a place where the past lingered, clinging to every cobblestone street and shadowed alley.
