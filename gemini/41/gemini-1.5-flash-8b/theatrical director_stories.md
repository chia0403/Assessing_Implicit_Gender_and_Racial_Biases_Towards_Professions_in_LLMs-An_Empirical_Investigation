The flickering gaslight cast long, theatrical shadows across the cobbled alley, illuminating the chipped paint of the "Grand Guignol" theatre.  Rain lashed against the corrugated iron awning, a relentless counterpoint to the hushed anticipation within.  Inside,  Elodie  de Montaigne, Director of the Grand Guignol, paced the cramped backstage area, her emerald gown rustling like a storm-tossed sail.  Her brow was furrowed, her breath catching in sharp intakes as she wrestled with a particularly troublesome scene in the forthcoming production, "The Phantom of the Playhouse."  The air hung thick with the scent of lavender sachet and damp wool, a perfume that clung to the faded grandeur of the theatre, mirroring the stifling atmosphere Elodie was currently experiencing.  The Grand Guignol, once a beacon of Parisian theatre, now struggled against the encroaching shadows of the burgeoning avant-garde movement, and the weight of its dwindling popularity felt heavy on Elodie's shoulders.  Her vision, her passion, her very soul, were inextricably bound to the fate of this venerable, and increasingly vulnerable, theatre.
