The flickering neon sign of the Rusty Mug cast a sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked alley.  A pungent smell of stale beer and something indefinably floral hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume of the backstreets of  Newhaven.  Private Detective  Jasper Blackwood, a man whose trench coat was almost as weathered as his reputation, hunched against the damp brick wall, a half-empty mug of lukewarm coffee sloshing precariously in his hand.  The city, a tapestry of towering, soot-stained buildings, roared around him, a symphony of distant sirens and the muted thuds of hurried footsteps.

Newhaven, 1938.  A city choked with ambition and shadowed by the ghosts of forgotten fortunes.  The docks, once vibrant hubs of trade, now lay silent and brooding, their warehouses like skeletal fingers reaching into the murky, industrial sky.  The air crackled with unspoken secrets and the whisper of impending change.  This was the city where Jasper Blackwood thrived, a city that offered as much danger as it did opportunity.  He was a creature of the shadows, a man who moved through the city's underbelly like a phantom, drawn to the tangled web of lies and betrayals that lay just beneath the surface of polite society.  Tonight, a new thread had caught his attention, a faint but persistent strand of silk woven into the fabric of Newhaven's dark heart.
