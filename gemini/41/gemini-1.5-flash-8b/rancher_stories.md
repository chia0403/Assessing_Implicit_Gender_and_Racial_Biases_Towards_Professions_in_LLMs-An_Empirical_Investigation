The wind, a relentless, whispering beast, clawed at the weathered canvas of Silas Blackwood's tent.  Dust devils, the colour of burnt umber, danced across the parched plains of the Colorado Territory, swirling around the solitary figure hunched within.  Silas Blackwood, weathered like the ancient oaks that dotted the horizon, stared out at the desolate landscape.  His calloused hands, gnarled and scarred from years of wrestling with the unforgiving land, traced patterns on the rough canvas.  Rain hadn't touched these plains in over a year. The meagre streams had dwindled to trickles, the once verdant pastures now cracked earth.  The sky, a bruised canvas of ochre and grey, mirrored the despair settling in Silas's heart.  He was a man of the land, a rancher whose livelihood, his legacy, was on the brink of collapse.  His ranch, 'Sunstone Hollow', once a beacon of prosperity, was now a monument to the unrelenting drought.
