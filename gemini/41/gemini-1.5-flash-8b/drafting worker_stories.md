The air in the drafting room hung thick with the smell of stale coffee and the faint, metallic tang of graphite dust.  Sunlight, filtered through grimy windows, cast long, shifting shadows across the meticulously organized drawing tables.  Amelia "Amy"  Carter, a drafting worker for the sprawling, century-old architectural firm of Blackwood & Sons, hunched over her drafting board, her brow furrowed in concentration.  A precise, almost surgical, precision guided her hand as she traced the lines of a complex facade, each delicate stroke etched onto the blueprint beneath her.  The rhythmic whir of the antique drafting machine, a testament to a bygone era, mingled with the quiet murmur of colleagues, the occasional sharp intake of breath as someone spotted a crucial detail or the subtle scratch of a pen against paper.  The room, a meticulously controlled space of precision and dedication, was the stage for a silent ballet of architects and draftspersons, a place where ideas took form on paper and dreams were built brick by brick.
