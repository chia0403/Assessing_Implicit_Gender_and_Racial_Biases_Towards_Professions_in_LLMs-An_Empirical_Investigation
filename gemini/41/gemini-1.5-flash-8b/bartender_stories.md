The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow over Amelia Blackwood, bartender extraordinaire, as she wiped down the sticky mahogany bar.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of moonlight piercing the grime-coated window, illuminating a sliver of the rain-slicked alleyway outside.  The air in the dimly lit tavern hung thick with the scent of stale beer, cheap cigarettes, and something indefinablyâ€¦metallic.  Tonight, as usual, the only other patrons were a lone, hunched figure huddled in a corner booth, nursing a whiskey, and a pair of boisterous fishermen arguing about the size of a particularly impressive trout.  Amelia, with her perpetually tired eyes and hands calloused from years of wielding a shaker, felt the familiar weight of the bar settling on her shoulders.  This was her sanctuary, this was her world. But tonight, a chill deeper than the autumn air seeped into her bones. Something was different. Something was...wrong.
