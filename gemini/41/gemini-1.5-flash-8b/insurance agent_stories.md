Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the "Lucky Clover" insurance agency, mimicking the relentless drumming in Amelia Hawthorne's head.  The tiny office, crammed with overflowing filing cabinets and the faint, sickly sweet smell of stale coffee, was her sanctuary and her cage.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grimy window.  Outside, the sprawling, neglected suburbs of Willow Creek sprawled beneath a bruised sky, reflecting the bruised mood Amelia carried within.  It was a Tuesday, the kind of day that felt like a never-ending cycle of unanswered phone calls, lukewarm instant coffee, and the relentless weight of unpaid bills.  As an insurance agent at the struggling Lucky Clover, Amelia found herself constantly battling the undertow of mounting debts and the growing frustration of people who just didn't seem to care about protecting what they had.  Another day, another mountain to climb.
