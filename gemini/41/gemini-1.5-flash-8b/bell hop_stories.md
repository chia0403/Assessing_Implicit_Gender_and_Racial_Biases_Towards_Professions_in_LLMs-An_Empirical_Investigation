The humid air hung thick and heavy, clinging to the brass fixtures of the Grand Imperial Hotel like a damp shroud.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight piercing the lobby's cavernous expanse.  Elias Thorne, bellhop extraordinaire, or at least that's what he aspired to be, adjusted the worn velvet of his uniform, a faded navy blue that seemed to absorb the heat more than reflect it.  The aroma of stale lilies and something vaguely resembling burnt sugar hung in the air, a perfume peculiar to grand hotels on the cusp of their twilight years.  His polished shoes squeaked softly on the aged marble floor as he navigated the throng of well-heeled guests, their laughter echoing like the distant chimes of a forgotten church.  Today, the usual symphony of arriving carriages and departing limousines was muted, replaced by an unnerving stillness, punctuated only by the rhythmic click-clack of his own footsteps.  He surveyed the lobby, a maze of waiting figures and veiled anxieties.  It was a Wednesday, like any other. But something felt different.  A chill.  Not just from the air conditioning (which never seemed to work properly), but something deeper, something unsettling.
