The biting wind whipped Amelia "Milly" Nightingale's trench coat around her legs, stinging her cheeks as she surveyed the desolate landscape.  A skeletal, grey-hued town, the remnants of a forgotten boom-town, huddled precariously against the jagged peaks of the Cordillera Blanca.  Twisted metal skeletons of abandoned mining equipment littered the scrubby ground, rusting silently beneath a sky the colour of bruised plums.  This was El Doradoâ€™s Ghost, and it was Milly's cinematic canvas.

The year is 1928.  Dust motes danced in the weak, filtered sunlight, clinging to the cracked, sun-bleached adobe walls of the town's lone saloon.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of stale whiskey and desperation.  A lone bartender, eyes bloodshot and weary, wiped down a sticky bar top, oblivious to the film crew bustling around him.  This was not a glamorous Hollywood set. This was the raw, unpolished heart of a dying era.  Milly, however, found a perverse beauty in its decay.  She was a director, known for her unflinching portrayal of human fragility, and this desolate corner of Peru was destined to be her latest masterpiece.
