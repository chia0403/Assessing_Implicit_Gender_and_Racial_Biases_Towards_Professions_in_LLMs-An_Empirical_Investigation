Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the abandoned factory, a relentless percussion that echoed the frantic rhythm in Dr. Eleanor Vance's mind.  The air hung thick with the smell of mildew and something else, something metallic and faintly sweet, a sickly scent that clung to the dust motes dancing in the single shaft of weak sunlight piercing the gloom.  This was no ordinary crime scene.  This wasâ€¦ personal.

The setting:  The forgotten heart of  Willow Creek, a rust-belt town choked by the ghosts of its industrial past.  Once vibrant with steel mills and humming machinery, Willow Creek now languished in a slow decay, its decaying brick buildings a testament to vanished prosperity.  Eleanor Vance, a forensic psychologist specializing in trauma and memory, stood in the cavernous space of what had once been a boiler room.  The walls, scarred by years of neglect, were now etched with a horrifying, almost artistic depiction of violence, blood seeping into the aged concrete like a stained-glass window reflecting a nightmare.  A single, flickering fluorescent bulb cast long, skeletal shadows across the scene, emphasizing the raw brutality that had unfolded here.  She felt the familiar knot of dread tightening in her stomach.  This wasn't just a case study; it was a mirror reflecting a fractured memory, and she was determined to find the truth buried within the wreckage.
