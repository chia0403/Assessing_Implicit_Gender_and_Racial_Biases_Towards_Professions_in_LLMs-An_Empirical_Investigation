Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Amelia Cavendishâ€™s penthouse office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  The city lights, usually a dazzling spectacle, looked bleak and unforgiving from this elevated vantage point.  Amelia, CEO of Cavendish Industries, stared out at the swirling grey mass, a phantom ache in her temple echoing the throbbing frustration in her chest.  The quarterly reports, meticulously crafted, meticulously dissected, still didn't explain the disconcerting dip in market share.  The data, cold and impersonal, failed to capture the gnawing unease that had been clawing at her for weeks.  She traced the outline of a chipped porcelain teacup on her polished mahogany desk, its delicate fragility a stark contrast to the looming weight of the business empire she commanded.

**Setting:** The penthouse suite of a towering skyscraper in the heart of Manhattan, New York City.  The city lights reflected in the rain-streaked windows, creating a shimmering, yet melancholic atmosphere. The office itself, though expansive and luxuriously appointed, was shrouded in a subdued, almost oppressive, quiet.  The scent of expensive leather and old wood filled the air, mingling with the faint aroma of rain-soaked pavement.
