The desert wind, a relentless, sandpaper rasp, whipped at Amelia "Milly" Stone's weathered face as she wrestled the colossal rig, the "Iron Colossus," into the narrow canyon.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of ochre and gray, danced around her oversized truck, obscuring the already meager visibility.  The sun, a molten orb sinking towards the jagged peaks of the Sierra Madre, cast long, skeletal shadows that stretched across the cracked earth.  Milly, her face streaked with grime and sweat, muttered a curse under her breath.  This stretch of the Arizona highway, notorious for its unforgiving turns and phantom desert creatures, was never pleasant, and tonight, the silence was unnerving.

The remnants of civilization clung to life along the skeletal highways, arteries of a fragmented nation.  Trucking, once a bustling industry, had become a perilous lifeline, a dangerous dance with the elements and the forgotten dangers of the past.  The Iron Colossus, her pride and passion, was more than just a machine; it was a sanctuary, a mobile home, and a portal to the past.
