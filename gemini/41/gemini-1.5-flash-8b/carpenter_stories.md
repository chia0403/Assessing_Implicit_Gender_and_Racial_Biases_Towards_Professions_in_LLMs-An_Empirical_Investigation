The scent of sawdust and linseed oil hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Elias Thornewood.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom of his workshop, illuminating splinters of wood caught in the intricate curves of a newly carved chair.  Elias, a carpenter of considerable skill and quiet renown in the village of Oakhaven,  adjusted his spectacles, his brow furrowed in concentration.  He was, as usual, deep in the throes of a project, a custom-built armoire destined for the esteemed Lady Beatrice Blackwood, a commission that had been both a challenge and a source of quiet anticipation.  Oakhaven, nestled in the heart of the whispering, ancient woods, was a place of predictable rhythms, where the changing seasons painted the landscape in hues of emerald, ochre, and burnt sienna, and where the sound of the carpenter's mallet was as familiar as the church bells.  The village, though small, held a tight-knit community, a tapestry woven from generations of families and intertwined fates. Today, though, Elias felt a tremor of unease, a sense of something out of place in the usual quietude, like a single raindrop falling on a perfectly still pond.
