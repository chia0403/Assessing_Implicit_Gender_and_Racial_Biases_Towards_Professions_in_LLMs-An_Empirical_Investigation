The fluorescent lights of Dr. Anya Petrova's office hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the rhythmic click-clack of Amelia Hayes's instruments.  Amelia, a dental hygienist with a perpetually tired smile and eyes that held the secrets of countless smiles and grimaces, carefully polished a molar.  The patient, a young woman with anxious eyes and a nervous twitch, bit her lip, a stark contrast to the gleaming perfection Amelia was striving for.

The office, nestled within the bustling heart of a rapidly gentrifying neighborhood, was a stark contrast to the vibrant murals and street performers outside.  Inside, polished mahogany walls and sterile white tile gave a sense of clinical calm, punctuated by the faint scent of antiseptic and the faint, lingering aroma of freshly brewed coffee from the small, worn-out machine in the back.  Sunlight, filtered through the grimy windowpanes, cast long shadows across the examination tables, making the space feel both sterile and oddly intimate.  Amelia, absorbed in her task, almost didn't hear the soft click of the door opening.
