The biting wind, a relentless, skeletal hand, clawed at the faded crimson tapestry of the Elizabethan-era roses clinging to the stone walls of Blackwood Manor.  Rain, the colour of pewter, hammered against the leaded glass windows, echoing the frantic rhythm of Elias Thorne's heart.  Elias, groundskeeper for the formidable Blackwood family, shivered, pulling his threadbare wool coat tighter around him.  The manor, steeped in centuries of whispered secrets and shadowed histories, was a monument to the unpredictable power of time, and tonight, it seemed to hold its breath, listening to the storm's furious symphony.  He hated the storm. It always brought with it the faintest possibility of more mischief, more damage.  More work.

Towering cypress trees, their needles sharp as daggers against the overcast sky, lined the long driveway, leading to the imposing manor house, its many windows like vacant eyes staring out into the tempest.  Elias, though accustomed to the groundsâ€™ somber beauty, found the storm's fury particularly unsettling.
