Her orders were simple, almost cruelly so: locate the lost settlement of Shangri-La, and if possible, retrieve the ancient artifact known as the Sunstone. The air, thin and unforgiving, pressed down on her with every gust.  Every creak and groan of the Thunderbolt echoed the relentless urgency of her mission.  The fate of an entire, unknown tribe hung in the balance.
