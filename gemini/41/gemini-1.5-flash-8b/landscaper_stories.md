The biting November wind whipped Amelia Ashworth's coat around her legs as she surveyed the skeletal remains of the garden.  Crimson leaves, once vibrant, now scattered like confetti on the frost-bitten earth.  The meticulously sculpted hedges, her pride and joy, were flattened, their carefully pruned shapes now fractured and defeated.  This wasn't just a bad storm; this was a war, a brutal winter onslaught against the carefully cultivated beauty she’d dedicated her life to.  Amelia, a landscaper by trade, a gardener by soul, felt a familiar twinge of frustration, a cold knot tightening in her chest.  The job, a sprawling estate known as "Havenwood," had been a commission meant to be a masterpiece, a testament to her skill, but the unrelenting winter had turned it into a battlefield of dead foliage.  Across the road, the opulent facade of Havenwood, a sprawling Tudor mansion, seemed to mock her from its lofty perch, its stained-glass windows glowing with a warm, indifferent light.  

Amelia lived in a small cottage nestled within the winding, tree-lined lanes of the secluded village of Oakhaven, a community steeped in history and tradition, a community that appreciated the artistry of landscaping, even if the weather did not. Her tools, her worn leather gloves, her trowel and spade—all were familiar companions, symbols of a life intertwined with the natural world.  This particular winter, though, felt different. This winter felt more than just challenging; it felt…defeating.
