Rain hammered against the leaded-glass windows of "Airy Spaces," a boutique interior design firm nestled in the heart of Bloomsbury, London.  Inside, Amelia Nightingale, a whirlwind of a woman with emerald eyes and a perpetually ruffled auburn bob, paced her office.  Stacks of blueprints, swatches of fabric, and mood boards overflowed the mahogany desk, a chaotic testament to the current project: transforming the grand, yet sadly neglected, manor house of Lord Ashworth on the outskirts of the county.  Lord Ashworth, a man Amelia considered both imposing and oddly charming, was notoriously difficult to please.  He had, after all, commissioned her to recreate a space that had last seen a design update in the 1800s, a period when extravagance was expected and practicality was a forgotten concept.  Amelia, while adept at conjuring opulent yet livable spaces, felt a nagging anxiety about this particular project.  The house hummed with a palpable history, a history that felt both inviting and foreboding.  Tonight, a particularly harsh downpour seemed to mirror the impending tension, and she knew this was going to be one of those projects where the walls themselves seemed to whisper secrets.
