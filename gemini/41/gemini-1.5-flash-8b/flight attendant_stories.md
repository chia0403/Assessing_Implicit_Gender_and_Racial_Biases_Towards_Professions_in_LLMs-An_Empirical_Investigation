Amelia "Amy"  Chandra, her name embroidered on the crisp white uniform, meticulously arranged a stack of complimentary amenity kits.  Each miniature bottle of scent, tiny lip balm, and miniature eye mask felt oddly symbolic, a fleeting moment of luxury in the vast expanse of the traveler's journey.

Something about the encounter with the enigmatic Mr. Tanaka – the man whose eyes had held a storm hidden behind polite smiles – felt off.

The setting was the sweltering cabin of a Singapore Airlines Boeing 777-300ER, the metallic interior humming with the rhythmic thrum of engines. Outside, the earth stretched out beneath them, a patchwork quilt of green fields and hazy cities, blurring into the infinite azure. Inside the cabin, hushed conversations mingled with the faint clinking of trays and the low thrum of the entertainment systems. Amy, stationed near the window seat, took in the serene view and the frenetic energy of the plane, a microcosm of the world itself, while her thoughts whirled around the potential danger.
