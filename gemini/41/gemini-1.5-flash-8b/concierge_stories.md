The chipped porcelain teacup trembled in Amelia "Amy" Nightingale's hand, mirroring the tremor in her stomach.  The afternoon sun, filtered through the dusty rose-colored curtains of the Grand Chateau's lobby, cast long shadows that danced with the swirling patterns of the Persian rug.  A symphony of hushed whispers and the gentle clinking of silverware emanated from the opulent dining room beyond, a stark contrast to the stillness that pressed down on Amy.  This wasn't the usual pre-luncheon buzz of the Grand Chateau; this was… expectant.

The Grand Chateau, a shimmering monument to faded grandeur perched on a hill overlooking the whispering pines of Blackwood Manor, had been her world for the past eight years.  The intricate ironwork of its balconies, the creaking of the ancient parquet floors, the subtle scent of old books and polished mahogany—these were the familiar notes of a song that held both beauty and a certain, unsettling, quietude. Now, a new, unknown melody was beginning to intrude, its first hesitant bars weaving themselves into the usual harmony.  The air hummed with a palpable sense of anticipation, a vibration that Amy, despite her years as a concierge, couldn't quite place.  Who was coming? And why did it feel so...important?
