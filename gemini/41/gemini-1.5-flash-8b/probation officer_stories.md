The fluorescent lights of the probation office hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic clatter of paperwork piling up on Amelia Hayes’s desk.  Dust motes danced in the pale light, mirroring the swirling thoughts in her mind.  Amelia, a probation officer with the stern but compassionate gaze of someone who'd seen too much, ran a hand through her already-disheveled dark hair.  Today, the usual tangle of teenage angst and petty theft felt especially thick, a suffocating fog settling over the small, beige-walled office.  Outside, the grey November sky mirrored the gloom within.  Amelia was stationed in the perpetually overcast, somewhat dreary city of Ashwood, a place where the concrete canyons seemed to swallow the sun whole.  Her office, tucked away on the third floor of the courthouse, was a quiet sanctuary of organized chaos.  Legal documents, case files, and half-eaten takeout containers – a testament to the late nights and rushed meals – cluttered the space.
