Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the dilapidated community centre, a relentless drumming that mirrored the rhythm of Amelia Hayes’ thoughts.  The air, thick with the smell of damp earth and something vaguely sweet, like overripe fruit, clung to her like a second skin.  Amelia, Occupational Therapist,  was deep in the throes of a frustrating assessment.  Her patient, a wiry old woman named Esme, sat hunched in a worn armchair, her gaze fixed on the swirling grey outside.  The community centre itself felt like a forgotten echo of a bygone era.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom of the room.  Cracked paint peeled from the walls, revealing layers of faded colour, like secrets whispering through time.  Amelia could almost hear the rustle of forgotten memories.  The faded posters on the walls – notices for bingo nights, lost dog announcements – were more poignant now, each one a snapshot of a life lived and now, perhaps, slowly fading away.  This was the heart of the old mining town of Oakhaven, a place where time seemed to stand still, and the only thing moving was the steady, relentless rain.
