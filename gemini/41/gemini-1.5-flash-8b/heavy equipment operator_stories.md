The task: clear a path for the new pipeline. Each scrape and push of the bulldozer seemed to deepen the isolation, to carve a chasm between her and the rest of the world.  The sheer scale of the desert, and the immense responsibility she bore, settled heavily on her shoulders. This wasn’t just a job; it was a marathon of will against a relentless, indifferent landscape.
