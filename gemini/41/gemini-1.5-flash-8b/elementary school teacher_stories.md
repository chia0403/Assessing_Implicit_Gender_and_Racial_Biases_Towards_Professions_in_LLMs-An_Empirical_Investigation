The fluorescent lights of Ms. Amelia Hawthorne's third-grade classroom hummed, a constant, irritating drone that somehow managed to permeate even the most spirited of lessons.  Today, however, the usual cacophony of giggles and whispered secrets was muted.  A thick, unsettling silence hung in the air, punctuated only by the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Amelia's pen against her lesson plan.  Outside, the crisp autumn air crackled with the promise of a storm.  Rain hammered against the windows, mimicking the drumming in Amelia's temples.

The classroom, usually a vibrant explosion of crayon colors and childlike drawings, felt subdued, almost somber.  Rows of small, meticulously organized desks, each holding a small collection of colored pencils and meticulously sharpened crayons, faced the front.  A tattered, hand-painted mural of woodland creatures, Amelia's students' masterpiece from the previous spring, still hung proudly above the chalkboard.  Sunlight, usually a welcome guest, was filtered through the storm clouds, casting long, shadowy figures across the room.  The scent of damp earth mingled with the faint, sweet smell of cinnamon that clung to the air from the small, freshly brewed pot sitting on her desk.
