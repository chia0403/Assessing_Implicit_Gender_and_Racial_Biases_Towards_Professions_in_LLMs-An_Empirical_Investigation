The fluorescent lights of the "Sweat Equity" gym hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia Katherine Hayes's life.  Amelia, a petite woman with a shock of fiery red hair perpetually escaping her meticulously-tied ponytail, surveyed the room.  Rows of treadmills groaned under the rhythmic pounding of feet, weights clanged in a discordant symphony, and the air buzzed with the low murmur of conversation, punctuated by the occasional exasperated sigh.  This was her sanctuary, her battlefield, her kingdom of sweat and sculpted physiques.  Today, however, the kingdom felt oddly… empty.  A single, defiant drip from a leaky pipe echoed through the cavernous space, a jarring counterpoint to the usual, purposeful cacophony.  Outside, the early morning city was already stirring, its rumble a distant, metallic thrum.  Amelia tightened her grip on the sweat-stained clipboard, her brow furrowing.  Today’s beginners’ class was supposed to be her most rewarding, her most inspiring.  The potential for transformation, for newfound vitality, hung heavy in the air, but an unsettling premonition clung to her like the lingering scent of chlorine.
