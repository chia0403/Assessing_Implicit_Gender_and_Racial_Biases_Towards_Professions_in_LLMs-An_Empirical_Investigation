Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the St. Jude's Hospice, mimicking the frantic rhythm of Amelia Hawthorneâ€™s pulse.  The air, thick with the scent of antiseptic and lilies, hung heavy in the small, dimly lit ward.  Fluorescent lights buzzed, casting an eerie glow on the pale faces of the patients, their breaths shallow and ragged. Amelia, a registered nurse with five years' experience at St. Jude's, felt the familiar weight of responsibility settle upon her shoulders. Tonight, the quiet hum of the hospice was fractured by an unusually high volume of distress calls, an unwelcome escalation from the usual ebb and flow of dying.  Each call, a new and desperate plea for relief from the unseen hand that gripped them.

The setting was a cramped, but well-meaning, ward of St. Jude's Hospice, a small, rural facility known for its compassionate care of terminally ill patients.  The hospice building itself was an unassuming structure, almost camouflaged by the surrounding rolling hills, but the interior, despite the shadows and the constant hum of machines, held a quiet dignity.  The atmosphere was a unique blend of weariness, hope, and the undeniable presence of mortality.  A palpable tension hung in the air, a stark contrast to the normally serene atmosphere that often marked a final peaceful night.
