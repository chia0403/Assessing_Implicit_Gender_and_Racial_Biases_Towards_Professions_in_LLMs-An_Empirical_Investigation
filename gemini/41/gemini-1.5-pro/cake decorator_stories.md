The scent of burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the usually saccharine atmosphere of "Flourish & Frost," Amelia Rose Hawthorne's bespoke cake studio.  Nestled between a dusty antique shop and a perpetually bustling dry cleaners on Sycamore Street, Flourish & Frost was Amelia's haven, a kaleidoscope of pastel-coloured piping bags, fondant molds shaped like whimsical creatures, and towers of tiered cake dummies.  Outside, the Charleston, South Carolina sun beat down on the cobblestone streets, casting long shadows that stretched across Amelia’s storefront window, currently displaying a magnificent three-tiered wedding cake sculpted to resemble a cascading waterfall of sugar orchids.  But inside, the air crackled with a tension far hotter than the July humidity.  Amelia, her usually immaculate apron dusted with powdered sugar and her auburn braid unraveling, stared with mounting horror at the smoking oven.  Today was supposed to be her triumphant return to the competitive baking scene after a two-year hiatus, and her Grand Marnier soufflé centerpiece was currently resembling something closer to volcanic rock.
