The biting November wind whipped at Amelia "Millie" Cartwright's scarlet scarf as she surveyed the cobbled square, the ancient stones slick with a recent rain.  A shiver, not entirely from the cold, skittered down her spine. Krakow's Rynek Główny, normally bustling with tourists eager for a taste of Polish history and pierogi, was eerily deserted. The pastel facades of the merchant houses lining the square seemed to huddle together, their shuttered windows like closed eyes against the encroaching twilight.  The only sound was the mournful clang of St. Mary's Basilica's bell tower, its hourly chime echoing off the empty buildings. Millie clutched the worn leather strap of her messenger bag, the laminated city map inside rustling like dry leaves. This was the third tour group in a row to cancel in as many days. The whispers had started, spreading through the city like the November fog – whispers of something lurking in the shadows, something ancient and hungry. Millie, a seasoned tour guide with a reputation for unflappability, dismissed them as superstitious nonsense. Until tonight.
