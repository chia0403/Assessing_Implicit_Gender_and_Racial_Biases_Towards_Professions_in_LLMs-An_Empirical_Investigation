The flickering fluorescent lights of the Grand Majestic Hotel lobby hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Elara Josephine Bellweather's Tuesday.  Rain lashed against the ornate glass doors, blurring the neon glow of the "Vacancy" sign across the street.  The Grand Majestic, however, was far from vacant.  Built in the roaring twenties, it clung to a faded grandeur, a relic of a bygone era nestled amidst the gleaming steel and glass of modern Seattle.  Elara, perched behind her mahogany reception desk – a behemoth of a thing, carved with cherubic faces and clawed feet – watched the downpour with a sigh.  The relentless drumming on the glass seemed to mirror the dull ache in her temples. It promised another long, monotonous shift filled with demanding guests and the faint scent of mildew that permeated the aging velvet drapes.
