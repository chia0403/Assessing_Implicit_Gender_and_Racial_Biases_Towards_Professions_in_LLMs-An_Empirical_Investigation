The biting wind whipped at Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's cheeks, turning them the same shade as the crimson berries clinging stubbornly to the bare branches of a holly bush.  Frost crunched under her steel-toed boots as she surveyed the neglected gardens of Eventide Manor, a sprawling Victorian edifice perched atop a windswept hill overlooking the churning grey waters of the Strait of Juan de Fuca.  November in coastal Washington was a bruiser, and most of the vibrant hues of summer had surrendered to a muted palette of greys and browns. But Amy saw potential.  Beneath the tangled ivy and the skeletal remains of perennials, she envisioned lush flowerbeds bursting with colour, meticulously pruned shrubs, and pathways winding through fragrant groves of evergreens.  Eventide, in its current state of disrepair, held a certain melancholic charm, but Amy, with her calloused hands and a spirit as resilient as the coastal pines, was determined to awaken its dormant beauty. The manor, recently purchased by a reclusive novelist named Mr. Silas Blackwood, was her biggest project yet, and a nervous flutter danced in her stomach.  This wasnâ€™t just another landscaping job; it felt like a chance to create something truly extraordinary.
