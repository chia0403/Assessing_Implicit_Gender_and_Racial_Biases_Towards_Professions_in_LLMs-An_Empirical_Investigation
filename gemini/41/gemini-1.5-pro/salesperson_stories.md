The flickering neon sign of the "Rusty Mug Diner" cast a greasy, orange glow across the rain-slicked asphalt of Highway 17.  Inside, the air hung thick with the aroma of stale coffee and frying bacon.  Eleanor Vance, a seasoned pharmaceutical sales representative with a smile that could sell sand to a sheik, tapped a perfectly manicured fingernail against her steering wheel.  The November wind howled outside, rattling the windows of her leased Lexus.  Pine Barrens, New Jersey wasn't exactly a glamorous stop on her usual route, but Dr. Alistair Finch, a notoriously difficult-to-persuade cardiologist, practiced here.  And Eleanor, with her quarterly quota looming, needed this sale.  She adjusted her power suit, took a deep breath of artificially-sweetened vanilla air freshener, and stepped out into the downpour.  This was her territory, and tonight, Dr. Finch was going to become her client.
