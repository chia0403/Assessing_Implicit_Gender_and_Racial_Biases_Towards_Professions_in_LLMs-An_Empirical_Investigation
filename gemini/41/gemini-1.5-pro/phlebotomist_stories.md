The fluorescent lights of St. Jude's Hospital hummed a monotonous B flat, a soundtrack Amelia Reyes had become so accustomed to, she barely registered it anymore.  It was 6:00 AM, the pre-dawn chill still clinging to the air outside, but inside the phlebotomy lab of St. Jude's, it was already a hive of activity.

The lab, a small, sterile room tucked away on the third floor, was dominated by a stainless steel counter cluttered with vials, tourniquets, and butterfly needles.  Outside the lab's single window, the Chicago skyline was just beginning to blush with the rising sun, its steel and glass towers mirroring the cold efficiency of the room in which Amelia began her rounds.  Today, however, the predictable rhythm of her work was about to be disrupted.
