Rain lashed against the stained-glass window depicting Saint Jude, patron saint of lost causes, his halo slightly askew from a crack that no one at O’Malley’s had ever bothered to fix.  The neon shamrock in the window flickered erratically, casting an unsettling green glow across the empty bar.  It was just after 2 am, the witching hour in the Irish quarter of Brooklyn, and the only sound besides the storm was the rhythmic clinking of ice as Elias “Eli” Fitzpatrick polished glasses, lost in thought. He meticulously dried each one with a worn linen cloth, his movements precise and almost ritualistic. O’Malley’s, a dimly lit sanctuary of worn mahogany and lingering cigarette smoke, usually buzzed with life, a haven for dockworkers, poets, and the occasional stray tourist. Tonight, however, it felt like a forgotten tomb, the silence broken only by Eli’s quiet sighs and the relentless drumming of the rain.  He wondered, not for the first time, if he’d made the right choice coming back here, to the place where his dreams had both begun and shattered.
