The salt-laced wind whipped Amelia Iris Thorne's auburn braid across her face, momentarily obscuring the view of the crumbling lighthouse she was attempting to capture on canvas.  Perched precariously on a windswept bluff overlooking the churning turquoise waters of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Amelia braced her easel against a gnarled, wind-stunted arbutus tree.  Around her, the rocky landscape was a riot of muted greens and greys, punctuated by the vibrant purple of blooming heather. The late afternoon sun, already dipping towards the horizon, cast long, dramatic shadows across the scene, transforming the weathered white of the lighthouse into a ghostly, ethereal glow.  Tatoosh Island, a dark and jagged silhouette on the horizon, seemed to beckon towards the open ocean, a silent promise of the wild beauty that lay beyond. This remote corner of Washington State, miles from the nearest town, was Amelia's sanctuary, her inspiration, and, for the foreseeable future, her home.
