The biting Alaskan wind whipped at Amelia “Ace” Reyes’s parka as she prepped her Cessna 206 for takeoff.  The sky above the tiny airstrip at Prudhoe Bay was a bruised purple, the weak sun barely cresting the horizon, casting long shadows across the snow-covered tundra.  Ace, her breath clouding in the frigid air, checked the fuel lines one last time, the familiar ritual calming her nerves.  This wasn't just another cargo run; this was a solo flight deep into the Brooks Range, delivering vital supplies to a remote research outpost cut off by a blizzard.  The radio crackled with a warning from Barrow Weather Service:  winds gusting to 50 knots and visibility dropping fast.  Ace’s hazel eyes narrowed. This was going to be a tricky one.
