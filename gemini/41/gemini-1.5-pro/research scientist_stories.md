The biting Antarctic wind whipped at Dr. Elias Thorne's parka, stinging his exposed cheeks despite the layers of thermal protection.  He adjusted his goggles, the world shifting from a blurry white expanse to a slightly clearer, yet still overwhelming, vista of snow and ice.  The McMurdo Station, a cluster of brightly colored buildings huddled against the vast nothingness, looked disconcertingly small from his vantage point on Observation Hill.

He knew something was out there, beneath the ice, something that shouldn't be.  Something his research had pointed him towards, something he was now desperately close to uncovering.
