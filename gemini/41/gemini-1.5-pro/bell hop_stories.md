The year is 1928. Rain lashed against the arched windows of the Grand Majestic Hotel, drumming a restless rhythm against the leaded glass. Inside, the lobby glowed with the warm light of chandeliers, casting dancing shadows across the polished marble floor.  A fire crackled merrily in the enormous hearth, offering a refuge from the November chill that seeped in with every gust of wind that rattled the heavy oak doors.  Fitzwilliam "Fitz" Archibald Peabody III, all five feet four inches of him in his crisp, burgundy uniform, shivered despite the thick wool of his bellhop jacket. He tucked a stray strand of sandy hair back under his cap and adjusted the brass buttons that gleamed against the fabric. The Grand Majestic, perched precariously on a cliff overlooking the tempestuous Atlantic, was nearly empty this time of year. The summer crowds, with their flapper dresses and raccoon coats, had long since departed, leaving Fitz to contend mostly with the occasional travelling salesman or eccentric recluse. Tonight, however, the air held a different kind of anticipation, a subtle hum of excitement that Fitz couldnâ€™t quite place.  He had a feeling something unusual was about to happen.
