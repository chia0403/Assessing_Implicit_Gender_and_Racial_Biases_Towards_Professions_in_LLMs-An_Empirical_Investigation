The bell above the door of "Nailed It," a tiny salon squeezed between a laundromat and a perpetually-closed bakery, jingled merrily. Rain lashed against the large window, blurring the neon "OPEN" sign into a hazy pink smear. Inside, Eliza Jane Peterson, her auburn hair pulled back in a practical braid, sighed and glanced at the clock. 5:57 pm. Three minutes until closing time on a Tuesday, and the only company she had all day was a half-eaten tuna sandwich and the rhythmic whir of the nail dryer.  The peeling floral wallpaper, a relic from the salon's previous owner, seemed to mock her with its faded cheerfulness. Eliza Jane idly swirled a bottle of iridescent glitter, the tiny flakes catching the dim light.  Willow Creek, Oregon, wasn't exactly a bustling metropolis, and rainy Tuesdays were notoriously slow.  Sheâ€™d almost resigned herself to another evening of reheated leftovers and true crime documentaries when the bell chimed again, a tall figure silhouetted against the downpour.
