Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune, punctuated by the rhythmic slap of the wiper blades on her aging Honda Civic, parked lonely and forlorn beneath the A-1 sign.  The air inside, thick with the scent of stale paper and desperation, crackled with the unspoken promise of either a miraculous windfall or a catastrophic audit.
