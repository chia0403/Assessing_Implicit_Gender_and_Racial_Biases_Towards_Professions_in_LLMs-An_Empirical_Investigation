The flickering neon sign of "Shear Perfection" buzzed intermittently, casting a lurid, purplish glow across the rain-slicked asphalt of Sycamore Street. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of hairspray, perm solution, and the faint, metallic tang of impending thunderstorms.  Amelia "Amy" Rose Hawthorne, her name stitched in elegant cursive on a pristine white smock, sighed and glanced at the clock. 10:47 pm.  Another late night at the salon, the only business still open in this otherwise deserted corner of Oakhaven, a town clinging precariously to the edge of the Ohio River.  Tonight, her only company was the rhythmic drumming of rain against the large picture window and the ghostly whir of the unoccupied styling chairs, spinning slowly in the draft.  Amy tapped a perfectly manicured nail against the counter, a nervous habit sheâ€™d picked up somewhere between her first disastrous perm and her award-winning updo at the state cosmetology competition.  Something felt off.  The quiet wasn't the usual peaceful lull before closing; it was a heavy, expectant silence, the kind that precedes a dramatic entrance, or perhaps, something far more sinister.
