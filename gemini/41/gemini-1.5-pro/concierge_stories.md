The lobby of the Grand Majestic Hotel hummed with a low, luxurious thrum.  Sunlight, fractured by the enormous crystal chandelier, splashed across the polished marble floor in kaleidoscopic patterns.  A gentle mist from the meticulously maintained indoor fountain scented the air with jasmine and bergamot.  Behind the gleaming mahogany concierge desk, Elias Thorne, his name tag pinned precisely to his impeccably tailored navy suit, offered a practiced, welcoming smile to a newly arrived guest.  It was 7:47 am, precisely seventeen minutes before the breakfast rush would begin, and Elias, as always, was ready.  Outside, the San Francisco fog was beginning to burn off, revealing glimpses of the sapphire bay and the majestic span of the Golden Gate Bridge.  Inside, the Grand Majestic was a world unto itself, a meticulously orchestrated ballet of luxury and service, and Elias was its conductor.
