The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne as he hurried across the cobbled courtyard of St. Jude's Hospital, the gothic arches of the building looming over him like skeletal fingers.  The wrought iron lampposts cast long, flickering shadows, painting the already gloomy scene in shades of charcoal and silver.  Fallen leaves, brittle and brown, skittered across the pavement, chasing after his heels like tiny, frantic ghosts. St. Jude's, nestled in the heart of Edinburgh's old town, had stood for centuries, its walls steeped in history â€“ and in the whispers of countless lives saved and lost.  Tonight, Elias hoped to add another to the former category.  His pager buzzed insistently against his hip, a jarring interruption to the rhythmic clang of the church bells echoing from nearby St. Giles' Cathedral.  A complicated aortic dissection.  Time, as always, was of the essence.
