The frosted breath of November clung to the air in Hollow Creek, a town so small you could spit across Main Street and hit the general store from the library steps.  Inside, amidst the hushed rustle of turning pages and the faint scent of old paper, Eleanor Vance, the town librarian, meticulously stamped due dates onto a fresh stack of returned novels. Shadows stretched long and thin across the polished wooden floor, mimicking the skeletal branches of the ancient oak that clawed at the library’s single, arched window. The only sounds were the rhythmic *thunk* of the date stamp and the occasional creak of the building settling, a sound Eleanor had grown so accustomed to she barely registered it anymore.  But tonight, a different sound pricked her ears – a soft, insistent scratching coming from somewhere deep within the library's labyrinthine stacks.
