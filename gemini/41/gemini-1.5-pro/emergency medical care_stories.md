The biting wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Reyes's dark hair across her face as she braced herself against the railing of the Brooklyn Bridge. Below, the East River churned a greasy grey, reflecting the pre-dawn gloom of a particularly raw November morning.  Sirens wailed in the distance, a mournful soundtrack to the city’s constant thrum. Amy, an Emergency Medical Technician with Station 47 in downtown Brooklyn, hadn't even finished her lukewarm coffee when the call came in: jumper on the bridge, south side, pedestrian walkway. This was her third potential jumper this month, and a knot of dread tightened in her stomach. Each time, a sliver of hope warred with the grim reality of what she might find.  The flashing red and blue lights of the ambulance, reflecting off the wet steel girders, painted the scene in an unsettling, almost theatrical light. As she stepped out of the rig, her partner, Marco Diaz, gave her a knowing look.  “Ready for this, Reyes?” he asked, his voice hushed against the wind. Amy just nodded, her breath misting in the cold air.  Every second counted.
