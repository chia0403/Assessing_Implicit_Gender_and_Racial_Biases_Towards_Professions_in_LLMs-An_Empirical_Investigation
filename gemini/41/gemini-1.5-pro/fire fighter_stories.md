The biting November wind whipped around Cassandra "Cassie" Reyes, tearing at the edges of her yellow turnout coat as she perched precariously on the ladder, three stories above the churning grey waters of Lake Michigan.  Ice, thin and treacherous, clung to the railing of the dilapidated pier, threatening to send both her and the shivering teenager clinging to a lamppost crashing into the frigid depths. The air, thick with the smell of lake water and fear, vibrated with the rhythmic clang of the fire engineâ€™s bell as it idled on the lakeshore drive, its flashing lights painting the scene in alternating strokes of red and blue.  The pier, a skeletal finger reaching out into the lake, was normally a haven for summer tourists, but tonight, it was a stage for a high-stakes rescue.  The icy spray from the waves crashing against the pilings coated Cassie's face shield, obscuring her vision, but she could still hear the boy's panicked gasps carried on the wind.  Each one was a sharp reminder of the rapidly dwindling time she had to get him down.
