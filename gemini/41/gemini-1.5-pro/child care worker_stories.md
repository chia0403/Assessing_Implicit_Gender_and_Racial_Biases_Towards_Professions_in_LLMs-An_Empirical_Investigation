The chipped paint of the Rainbow Ranch daycare center sign seemed to mock Amelia "Amy" Hernandez as she trudged through the ankle-deep slush of a late February morning in rural Vermont.  Flakes of snow, fat and wet, clung to her eyelashes and the worn wool of her peacoat. Rainbow Ranch, nestled in a frosty hollow between two snow-laden hills, usually looked picturesque, like something plucked from a children's book.

The biting wind whistled a mournful tune through the gaps in the old wooden window frames, a sound that echoed the unsettling quiet in Amy's heart.  She hadn't had a good feeling about this place since she started two weeks ago, and today, that feeling had intensified into something close to dread.
