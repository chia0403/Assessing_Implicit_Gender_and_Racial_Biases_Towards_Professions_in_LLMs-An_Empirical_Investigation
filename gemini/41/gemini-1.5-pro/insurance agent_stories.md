Rain lashed against the stained-glass window depicting St. Jude, patron saint of lost causes, a fitting tableau for the office of Albert Finch, Insurance Agent.  His cramped office, perched above Mrs. Higgins' perpetually dusty antique shop in the perpetually overcast town of Dullsville, Pennsylvania, smelled of damp wool and stale coffee. Albert himself, a man of forty-two with a comb-over that defied gravity and a perpetually worried frown, stared at the overflowing ashtray on his desk.  Outside, the November wind howled like a banshee, rattling the loose pane in the window frame, a sound that mirrored the uneasy fluttering in his stomach. He hadn't sold a single policy in three weeks, and Mrs. Higgins' rent was due.  This morning, however, something was different.  The phone hadn't rung once, which in itself was unusual, and a thick, unnatural fog had rolled in, clinging to the town like a shroud.  It was the kind of fog that made even the familiar streetlights outside seem sinister.  Just as Albert reached for the lukewarm coffee, a sharp rap echoed through the room.
