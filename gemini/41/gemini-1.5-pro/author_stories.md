The salt-laced wind whipped at Amelia Persephone Hawthorne's shawl as she stared across the choppy waters of the Irish Sea. From her vantage point on the windswept cliffs of Howth Head, the Baily Lighthouse, a stark white sentinel against the bruised purple sky, seemed precariously close to toppling into the churning waves below.  Grey gulls cried overhead, their calls echoing the turmoil in Amelia’s own heart.  She’d come to this remote corner of Ireland seeking solace, a quiet place to finish her latest novel, a gothic thriller set amidst the crumbling grandeur of a forgotten estate.  Instead, she found herself besieged by a different kind of tempest – a paralyzing writer’s block that threatened to swallow her whole.  The quaint cottage she’d rented, perched precariously on the cliff edge, offered breathtaking views, but the beauty only amplified her inner emptiness. The pages of her manuscript remained stubbornly blank, mocking her with their pristine whiteness, a stark contrast to the stormy landscape unfolding before her.
