The biting November wind whipped around Eleanor Vance, PA-C, as she hurried across the cobbled courtyard of St. Jude's Community Hospital.  The ancient stones, slick with a mixture of rain and sleet, offered little traction beneath her worn leather boots.  Above her, gargoyles leered from the gothic architecture, their grotesque faces seeming to mock the swirling flurries.  St. Judeâ€™s, nestled deep in the heart of the Appalachian Mountains in rural West Virginia, felt more like a medieval fortress than a hospital, a feeling amplified by the isolation and the encroaching darkness.  Tonight, the only illumination came from the flickering gas lamps that lined the walkways and the warm, inviting glow emanating from the Emergency Room entrance where Eleanor was headed.  She pulled her fleece-lined hood tighter around her face, a shiver rattling down her spine that had nothing to do with the cold.  Tonight, something felt different. The air itself seemed heavy with a palpable sense of foreboding.
