The rain hammered against the panoramic windows of Cassandra "Cassie" Moreau's office, forty-two stories above the churning grey expanse of Lake Michigan.  The Chicago skyline, usually a dazzling tapestry of steel and glass, was blurred and fragmented, swallowed by the storm. Cassie, Chief Operating Officer of Thorne Industries, tapped a manicured nail against the cool glass, her gaze fixed on the faint glimmer of a barge fighting its way across the turbulent water.  Her office, a minimalist masterpiece of white leather and polished chrome, reflected the muted light, amplifying the sense of isolation.  The only sound besides the relentless rain was the low hum of the climate control system, a constant, almost subliminal reminder of the perfectly controlled environment she had created for herself.  This control, this meticulous order, was Cassie's sanctuary, her armor against a world that seemed determined to descend into chaos.  Today, however, even her carefully constructed fortress felt vulnerable, as though the storm raging outside was a reflection of the tempest brewing within Thorne Industries itself.
