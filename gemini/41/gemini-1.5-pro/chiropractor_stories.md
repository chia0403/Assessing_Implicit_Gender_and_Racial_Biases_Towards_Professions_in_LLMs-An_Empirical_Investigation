The crisp October air, scented with woodsmoke and decaying leaves, whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne as he locked the back door of his clinic.  Fallen maple leaves, the color of burnt orange and rust, skittered across the brick-paved alleyway in downtown Harmony Creek.  Harmony Creek was the kind of town where everyone knew everyone else's business, and where the tallest building was the four-story brick structure housing Elias's practice, Thorne Chiropractic, on the second floor. The flickering gaslights that lined Main Street cast long, dancing shadows that seemed to mimic the swaying branches of the ancient oak trees lining the street. It was a Friday evening, and the air hummed with a quiet anticipation of the weekend, a stillness broken only by the occasional rumble of a passing pickup truck. Elias, his hands shoved deep in the pockets of his tweed jacket, glanced up at the darkening sky, a single star already bravely winking into existence.  He had a long drive ahead of him, back to his secluded cabin on the outskirts of town, a place where the only sounds were the whispering pines and the gentle rush of the Harmony Creek itself.  He was looking forward to the solitude, the quiet escape from the aches and pains, both physical and emotional, that filled his days. But tonight, the quiet felt different, tinged with an unease he couldn't quite place.
