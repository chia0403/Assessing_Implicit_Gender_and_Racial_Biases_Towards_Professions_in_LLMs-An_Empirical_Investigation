The biting wind, scented with woodsmoke and the faint metallic tang of the nearby slaughterhouse, whipped around Elias Thorne's thick wool coat. Frost crunched beneath his heavy boots as he crossed the cobbled market square of Oakhaven, a town nestled deep within the valley where the Blackfen Moors met the whispering Greystone Woods.

His breath plumed white in the frigid air as he unlocked the sturdy oak door of "Thorne's Prime Cuts," a butcher shop his grandfather had built with his own two hands, its sign a weathered depiction of a cleaver crossed with a meat hook.  Inside, the air hung heavy with the rich, earthy aroma of aging beef and the subtle sweetness of curing pork.  Sawdust dusted the floor, absorbing the day's inevitable spills, and a single flickering gas lamp cast long, dancing shadows across the hanging carcasses, their pale forms resembling ghostly dancers in the pre-dawn gloom.
