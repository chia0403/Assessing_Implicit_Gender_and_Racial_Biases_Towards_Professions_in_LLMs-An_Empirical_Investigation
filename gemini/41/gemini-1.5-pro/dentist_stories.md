The insistent Vermont wind rattled the leaded panes of Dr. Elias Thatcher’s office window, a counterpoint to the whirring of his high-speed drill. Snow, the kind that clung to everything and refused to melt even in the weak November sun, piled against the windowsill, obscuring the view of the quaint, snow-globe-esque town of Havenwood. Inside, the scent of antiseptic mingled with the metallic tang of amalgam, a familiar aroma that Elias found oddly comforting. He meticulously filled a molar for Mrs. Higgins, a woman whose stories about her prize-winning zucchini were as legendary as her fear of dentists.  Havenwood, nestled deep in the Green Mountains, was a town where everyone knew everyone else’s business, and Elias, despite his quiet nature, was no exception. His practice, tucked between the general store and the perpetually dusty antique shop, was a cornerstone of the community. He’d returned to Havenwood after dental school, drawn back to the quiet rhythm of life he’d known since childhood, a life that, until recently, had been as predictable as the changing seasons.
