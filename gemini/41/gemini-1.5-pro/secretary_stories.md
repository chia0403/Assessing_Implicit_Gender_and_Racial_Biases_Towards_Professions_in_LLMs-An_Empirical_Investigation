The air, even indoors, carried a faint tang of salt and coal smoke, a smell Amelia had grown accustomed to in her five years as Mr. Grimshaw Seniorâ€™s secretary.  The office itself was a study in mahogany and dimly lit corners, cluttered with dusty ledgers, overflowing ashtrays, and framed pictures of ships that had long since met their watery graves.
