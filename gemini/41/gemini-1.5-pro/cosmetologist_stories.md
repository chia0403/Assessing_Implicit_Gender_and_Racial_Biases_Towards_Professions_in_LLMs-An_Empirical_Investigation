The air in "Curl Up & Dye" hung thick with the aroma of hairspray, perm solution, and that oddly comforting chemical scent unique to beauty salons.  Rain lashed against the large picture window overlooking Main Street, blurring the already fading neon signs of the sleepy town of Harmony Creek, Pennsylvania.  Eleanor Vance, a cosmetologist of twenty years standing, tapped a perfectly manicured nail against her appointment book, a frown creasing her usually cheerful face.  It was a Tuesday afternoon in October, typically a busy time for her, but today the salon was eerily quiet.  Even Mrs. Higgins, who usually popped in for a weekly wash and set, hadn't shown.  Eleanor glanced at the clock, its ornate golden hands frozen at 2:17 pm.  It felt like time itself was holding its breath, waiting for something to happen.
