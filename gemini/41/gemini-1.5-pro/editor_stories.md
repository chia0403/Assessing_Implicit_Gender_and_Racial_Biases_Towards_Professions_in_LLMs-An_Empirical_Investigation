Rain lashed against the arched windows of Amelia Thorne's attic apartment, mimicking the tempest brewing inside her.  The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the cluttered room, illuminating stacks of manuscripts, overflowing ashtrays, and half-empty teacups.  Outside, the Parisian rooftops gleamed slickly under the November downpour, the gargoyles of Notre Dame seeming to leer down at the city below.  Amelia, her dark hair pulled back in a messy bun, perched on a worn velvet chair, a red pen clutched in her hand, poised over the latest submission to *Le Mercure Litt√©raire*.  It was a dreadful piece of romantic drivel, full of swooning damsels and improbably handsome dukes, the sort of thing that made her temples throb.  But rent was due, and *Le Mercure*, despite its questionable literary taste, paid promptly.  Paris in 1923 was expensive, even for a fiercely independent editor like Amelia.
