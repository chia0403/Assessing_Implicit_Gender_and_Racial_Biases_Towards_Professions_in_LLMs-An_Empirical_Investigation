The biting wind whipped off the East River, carrying the scent of brine and something faintly metallic that Detective Isabella “Izzy” Diaz recognized as blood.  It clung to the frayed edges of the crime scene tape fluttering around the abandoned pier on the edge of Brooklyn’s Red Hook.  The sodium-vapor lamps overhead cast a sickly yellow glow, painting the scene in a palette of harsh shadows and lurid highlights.  Rain, a fine, stinging mist, had begun to fall, slicking the cobblestones and turning the chalk outline of a body into a slowly dissolving ghost.  Izzy pulled her collar higher, tucking her chin into the worn leather of her jacket.  This was her third homicide in as many weeks, and the gnawing fatigue, a constant companion these days, burrowed deeper into her bones.  This wasn’t just another body dumped on the waterfront; something about the stillness in the air, the way the shadows clung to the edges of the pier, told her this one was different.
