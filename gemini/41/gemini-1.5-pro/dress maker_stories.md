The clatter of horse-drawn carriages on cobblestones echoed through the tall windows of Madame Evangeline Moreau's atelier, a rhythmic counterpoint to the whisper of silk against silk.  Evangeline, her dark hair pulled back in a severe chignon that emphasized the sharp angles of her face, pinned a length of emerald green satin to a dress form padded to the exact specifications of Lady Beatrice Ashworth.  The room, tucked away on a quiet side street just a stone's throw from the bustling heart of 1888 Paris, was a sanctuary of creativity and meticulous order.  Sunlight streamed through the large windows, illuminating bolts of fabric in every shade imaginable, stacked neatly on shelves that reached the high, vaulted ceiling.  Sketches, half-finished designs, and swatches of lace and ribbon pinned to a large corkboard hinted at the artistry within.  A faint scent of lavender and beeswax, Evangeline’s preferred candle fragrance, hung in the air, mingling with the sharper aroma of freshly sharpened pins and the earthy smell of the dyes she mixed herself.  Outside, the city thrummed with the energy of a new day, but within the confines of her atelier, Evangeline’s world revolved around the delicate dance of needle and thread, transforming fabric into dreams.
