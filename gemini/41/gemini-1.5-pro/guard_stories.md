The biting wind whipped at Elias Thorne's thick wool cloak, the icy tendrils finding their way through even the smallest gaps in his armor. He stamped his feet, the clang of steel boots on the frozen cobblestones echoing through the deserted courtyard of Castle Drakon.  Towering above him, the castle’s obsidian walls seemed to absorb what little moonlight pierced the swirling snow. Built on the precipice of a windswept cliff overlooking the churning Gray Sea, Drakon Castle was as isolated as it was imposing. Tonight, the only sounds were the mournful cry of the wind and the rhythmic crash of waves against the rocks far below. Elias’s breath plumed white in the frigid air as he began his patrol along the western ramparts, the flickering lantern in his hand casting long, dancing shadows that mimicked the swirling snow. This was his third watch of the night, and the biting cold was beginning to numb his senses.  He gripped the worn hilt of his sword, a small comfort against the growing unease that settled in his stomach.  Something felt… different tonight.
