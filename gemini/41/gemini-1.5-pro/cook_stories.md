The clatter of pots and pans was Amelia "Milly" Dubois's morning symphony.  Dawn filtered through the grimy windows of The Salty Spoon Diner, painting stripes of greasy sunlight across the checkered linoleum floor.  The Spoon, nestled precariously between a pawn shop and a laundromat in the perpetually overcast port town of Port Blossom, Maine, wasn't much to look at.  Salt spray from the restless Atlantic had gnawed at the paint, leaving the exterior a peeling patchwork of seafoam green and faded yellow. Inside, the air hung thick with the mingled aromas of frying bacon, stale coffee, and the faint, lingering scent of yesterday's fish special.  Milly, a woman whose ample frame seemed perfectly suited to the bustling kitchen, hummed a tuneless melody as she flipped pancakes with the practiced ease of a seasoned short-order cook.
