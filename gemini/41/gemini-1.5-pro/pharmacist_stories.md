The bell above the door of Apothecary's Rest tinkled a melancholic two-note chime as the last customer of the day exited. Rain lashed against the large bay window, blurring the view of the gas-lit cobbled street in the small, isolated town of Hollow Creek.  Drusilla Evangeline Periwinkle, her name as elaborate and slightly dusty as the shop itself, sighed and rubbed the bridge of her nose. The scent of lavender and chamomile, usually comforting, felt cloying after such a long, dreary day.  Apothecary's Rest, with its dark wood shelves stacked high with jars of dried herbs, tinctures, and powders, had been in her family for generations. It was a place of healing, of quiet whispers and secret remedies, a sanctuary tucked away in the misty folds of the Welsh mountains.  But tonight, the silence felt heavy, oppressive, like a premonition hanging in the air.
