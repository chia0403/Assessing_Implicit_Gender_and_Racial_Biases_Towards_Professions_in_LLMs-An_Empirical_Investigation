The biting November wind whipped around Professor Alistair Finchley as he hurried across the cobbled quadrangle of St. Jude's College, Oxford.  Gargoyles leered down from the honey-coloured stone walls, their grotesque features softened by a dusting of snow.  Alistair clutched his threadbare tweed coat tighter, the chill seeping through to his bones despite the thick layers he wore. The ancient college, with its labyrinthine corridors and hushed libraries, normally exuded an aura of peaceful contemplation. But tonight, a palpable unease hung in the air, a discordant note in the usually harmonious academic hum.  The buttery's warm glow, usually a beacon of comfort on such a night, seemed to flicker nervously, as if reflecting the anxiety that Alistair himself felt tightening in his chest.  He had a lecture to prepare, a particularly complex one on the esoteric symbolism of medieval manuscripts, but his mind was elsewhere, preoccupied by the cryptic message he’d received that afternoon, a single sheet of parchment slipped under his office door, bearing a symbol he hadn’t seen since his days delving into forgotten archives in the Vatican Library.
