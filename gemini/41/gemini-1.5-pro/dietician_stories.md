The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne's auburn braid across her face as she hurried down Bleecker Street, the scent of roasting chestnuts battling with the exhaust fumes for dominance.  A flurry of fat snowflakes, the first of the season, began to swirl around her, dusting the vibrant, graffiti-tagged walls of the West Village with a premature frosting.  Amelia clutched her battered, leather-bound notebook tighter, its pages filled with meticulously scribbled meal plans and calorie counts. Her destination: the newly opened "Clean Slate Cafe," a trendy establishment boasting organic, locally-sourced ingredients and a menu Amelia had been both eager to analyze and slightly apprehensive about.  Sheâ€™d heard whispers of spirulina smoothies and activated charcoal lattes, trendy concoctions that made her practical, evidence-based dietician heart twitch with a mix of curiosity and concern.  This consultation, her first independent client since branching out from the rigid confines of the city hospital, had the potential to make or break her fledgling private practice.  And Amelia, ever the planner, intended to make it a resounding success.
