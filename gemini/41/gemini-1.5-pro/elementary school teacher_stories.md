The late October wind howled a mournful tune around the eaves of Maplewood Elementary, rattling the already-loose panes in Miss Eleanor Vance's third-grade classroom. Rain lashed against the windows, blurring the view of the vibrant playground, now deserted and slick with water.  Inside, the air smelled of wet wool and the faint, sweet tang of construction paper.  Eleanor, her auburn hair escaping its usual neat bun, surveyed the chaos of Friday afternoon: scattered glue sticks, crayon shavings dusting the well-worn carpet, and the lingering echo of twenty-seven eight-year-olds finally unleashed for the weekend.  She sighed, pushing a stray lock of hair behind her ear, and began to tidy up.  Maplewood, nestled in the heart of the sleepy, apple-orchard-dotted town of Harmony Creek, usually exuded an air of peaceful charm. But today, the storm mirroring the growing unease in Eleanor's heart, hinted at something darker brewing.
