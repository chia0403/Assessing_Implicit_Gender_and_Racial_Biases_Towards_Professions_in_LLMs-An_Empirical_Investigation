The flickering neon sign of "Shear Perfection" buzzed intermittently, casting a sickly green light across the rain-slicked pavement of Bleaker Street. Inside, Amelia "Amy" Dubois sighed, watching the rivulets of water trace paths down the dusty window. The 6:00pm rush hadn't materialized, and the only sound besides the rhythmic drip-drip-drip was the hum of the empty barber chairs, patiently awaiting clients who seemed to prefer staying dry at home. Amy, clad in her trademark denim overalls and a faded Ramones t-shirt, idly snipped at a frayed piece of string hanging from her scissors, the only tools sheâ€™d wielded all afternoon. The air in the small salon hung heavy with the scent of cheap hairspray and unspoken disappointment. Bleaker Street, true to its name, was proving less than inspiring for a budding entrepreneurial hairstylist.  The rain hammered against the windowpane, a melancholic soundtrack to Amy's dwindling hopes.
