Rain lashed against the mullioned windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's office, mimicking the tempest brewing inside his newest patient.  The room, perched high above the cobbled streets of Bath, usually felt calming with its muted Farrow & Ball paint, the worn leather Chesterfield sofa, and the subtle scent of sandalwood.  But tonight, the storm outside seemed to amplify the tension crackling in the air. Elias, his full name Elias Peregrine Thorne, adjusted his spectacles and watched as Mrs. Albright twisted a tissue into a tight, damp spiral in her lap.  Beyond the window, the gaslights flickered, casting dancing shadows across the honey-coloured stone buildings of the city, creating an almost theatrical backdrop to the unfolding drama within. It was a Tuesday evening, the kind Elias usually dedicated to catching up on journals or enjoying a quiet pint at the Raven, a pub tucked away in a nearby alley.  Instead, he found himself drawn into a case that already felt unnervingly complex, just from the brief phone call he'd received earlier that day.  Mrs. Albright had refused to disclose anything specific, saying only that it was a matter of "utmost urgency" and that she required his "particular expertise."  Elias, with a sigh he kept hidden, braced himself.  This felt different.
