The biting wind whipped off the Puget Sound, stinging Amelia “Amy” Reyes’s cheeks as she wrestled with a tangle of frozen Christmas lights. They were strung haphazardly across the eaves of the Saltwater Inn, a three-story Victorian edifice clinging precariously to the cliffside overlooking the choppy grey water. The inn, a patchwork of peeling paint and gingerbread trim, was a Bainbridge Island landmark, famous for its breathtaking views and equally breathtakingly eccentric owner, Mrs. Hawthorne.  Amy, bundled in her thickest Carhartt overalls and a beanie pulled low over her ears, muttered a string of Spanish curses under her breath.  The lights, half-burned out and stubbornly resistant to her efforts, were the latest in a long line of electrical emergencies Mrs. Hawthorne had summoned her for.  This time, the elderly woman had insisted they be fixed before the annual Christmas Eve bonfire on the beach below, a tradition almost as old as the inn itself. The salty air smelled of pine needles and impending rain, and the sky, a bruised purple, promised a storm before nightfall.
