The biting November wind whipped around Amelia Reyes, plastering loose strands of her dark hair against her cheeks. She tugged her crimson scarf tighter, the vibrant colour a stark contrast to the greyscale world of scaffolding, concrete, and steel that dominated her view. Below her, twenty stories down, the skeletal frame of the Zephyr Tower clawed at the London skyline. Amelia, a licensed architect for just five years, but with a decade’s worth of relentless ambition packed into her petite frame, traced the building's jagged silhouette with her gloved finger. This was her baby, her first solo project, and the culmination of countless sleepless nights hunched over blueprints and wrestling with recalcitrant city planning officials.  The air vibrated with the clanging rhythm of construction, a metallic symphony that, to Amelia, sounded sweeter than any orchestra.  Grey clouds scudded across the sky, mirroring the churning anxiety in her stomach. Today was the topping-out ceremony, and while the building was structurally sound, Amelia couldn't shake the feeling that something, something she couldn’t quite place, was just slightly…off.
