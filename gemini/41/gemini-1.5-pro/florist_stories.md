The bell above the door of "Petal & Plume" chimed, a delicate counterpoint to the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of Eliza Jane Wilder's shears.  Outside, the November wind howled down Wysteria Lane, rattling the paned glass and scattering fallen leaves across the cobblestone street. Inside, the air hung warm and fragrant, a comforting blend of damp earth, cut stems, and the subtle spice of Eliza’s signature winter blend potpourri – cinnamon, cloves, and dried orange peel.  Petal & Plume, nestled between a dusty antique shop and a perpetually bustling bakery, was Eliza’s sanctuary, a riot of color and texture in the otherwise grey landscape of Hollow Creek, Vermont.  The shop, barely wider than a carriage, was overflowing with buckets of vibrant blooms, from cascading amaryllis to delicate sprigs of baby’s breath.  Sunlight, filtered through the frosted window, illuminated dust motes dancing in the air, creating an almost ethereal atmosphere. Eliza, her auburn braid draped over one shoulder, hummed softly to herself, lost in the meticulous task of arranging a bridal bouquet of ivory roses and deep purple anemones.  She didn't notice the new arrival until a tentative cough broke the spell.
