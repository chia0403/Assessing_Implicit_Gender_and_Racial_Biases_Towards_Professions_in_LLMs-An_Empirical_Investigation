The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Eleanor Vance as she hurried across the snow-dusted quad of Maplewood High.  Dead leaves, the color of burnt caramel, skittered across the cracked asphalt, chased by icy gusts.  Eleanor tugged her burgundy scarf tighter around her neck, the wool scratching against her skin. Above her, the skeletal branches of the ancient oak trees that lined the quad rattled like dry bones.  It was the kind of day that made her long for a roaring fire, a mug of hot tea, and the comforting weight of her old tabby cat, Winston. Instead, she was headed towards the principal’s office, a knot of apprehension tightening in her stomach. This was her first year at Maplewood, and while the sprawling suburban high school seemed idyllic on the surface, a recent spate of student anxiety incidents, coupled with an unsettlingly high number of absences, had created a palpable tension beneath the veneer of normalcy.  Principal Henderson’s email, summoning her for an “urgent meeting,” had only amplified her unease.
