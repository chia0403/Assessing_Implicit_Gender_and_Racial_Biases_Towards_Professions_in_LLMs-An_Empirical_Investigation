The rusty scissors, nestled between the comb and the straight razor in Elias Thorne's worn leather holster, whispered a metallic sigh as he hung them on the hook beside his chair. Dust motes danced in the afternoon sunbeams that slanted through the grimy window of Thorne's Tonsorial Parlour, illuminating the faded posters of bygone hairstyles and the collection of antique shaving mugs lining the shelves.  The shop, tucked between a dusty pawnbroker's and a perpetually closed fortune teller's on Bleaker Street, exhaled the scent of bay rum, talcum powder, and a lingering hint of yesterday's cigar smoke.  Elias, his own silver hair neatly slicked back, wiped a bead of sweat from his forehead with the back of his hand. The oppressive July heat had even driven the usually ubiquitous stray cats of Bleaker Street into the shadows, leaving the street eerily deserted.  It was the kind of afternoon that promised trouble.
