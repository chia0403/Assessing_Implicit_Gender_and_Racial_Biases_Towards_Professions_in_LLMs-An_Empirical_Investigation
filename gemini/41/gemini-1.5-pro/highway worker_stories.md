The biting wind whipped across the desolate stretch of Interstate 80, making the reflective stripes on Elias Vance's orange vest dance like frantic fireflies.  Elias, his breath puffing out in ghostly plumes, tightened the grip on his shovel, the worn metal handle cold against his gloved hand.  Grey clouds scudded low, threatening snow, and the skeletal branches of the cottonwoods lining the highway rattled a mournful tune.  It was just past dawn, the kind of bleak November morning in Wyoming where the sun seemed reluctant to rise, leaving the world painted in shades of grey and steel.  Mile marker 147 stood sentinel, its faded green paint peeling like sunburnt skin.  Beside it, a fractured guardrail, twisted like a discarded ribbon, was Elias's task for the day.  He was alone, save for the occasional whoosh of a passing semi-truck, its headlights cutting briefly through the pre-dawn gloom, a reminder of the world rushing past the quiet solitude of his roadside vigil.
