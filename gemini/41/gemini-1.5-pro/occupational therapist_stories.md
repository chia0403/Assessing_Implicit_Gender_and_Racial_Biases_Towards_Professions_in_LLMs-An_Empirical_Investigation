The rain hammered against the stained-glass window depicting St. Jude, patron saint of lost causes, a fitting image for Drusilla "Dru" Finch's current mood.  Grey November pressed down on the small town of Havenwood, Maine, a place where gossip travelled faster than the biting wind whistling down from the Canadian border.  Dru, bundled in a thick wool cardigan despite the crackling fire in the hearth, perched on the edge of a worn velvet armchair in her office, a converted sunroom overlooking the choppy waters of Havenwood Cove.  The salty air, usually a balm to her soul, brought little comfort today.  The meticulously organized shelves lining the walls, brimming with sensory toys, therapy putty, and adaptive equipment, seemed to mock her with their cheerful practicality.  Seven years she'd been an occupational therapist, helping people regain lost functions, rebuild shattered lives.  But today, Dru felt like the one in need of mending.
