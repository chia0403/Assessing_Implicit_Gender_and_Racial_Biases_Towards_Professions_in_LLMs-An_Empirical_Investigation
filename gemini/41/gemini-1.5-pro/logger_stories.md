The biting November wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the towering pines, whistling a mournful tune that echoed through the Cascade Mountains.  Frost crunched under the heavy boots of Jedediah "Jed" Blackwood as he surveyed the stand of Douglas fir, their green needles dusted with a fine layer of snow.  Dawn hadn't yet broken, painting the eastern sky in hues of bruised purple and deep grey, but Jed was already at work, the pale beam of his headlamp slicing through the pre-dawn gloom.  Camp Hope, a collection of rough-hewn cabins and trailers nestled in a sheltered valley five miles down the mountain, was still asleep, but Jed preferred the solitude of these early hours.  Here, amongst the giants of the forest, he felt a sense of peace he found nowhere else.  The air, crisp and clean with the scent of pine and damp earth, filled his lungs, a stark contrast to the stale cigarette smoke that perpetually hung in the air back at camp. Today, however, a knot of unease tightened in Jed’s gut, a feeling he couldn't quite shake. It wasn't the usual pre-felling jitters, but something deeper, more primal.  The forest felt… different.
