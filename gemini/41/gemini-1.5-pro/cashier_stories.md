The flickering fluorescent lights of the Quick Stop, a 24-hour convenience store nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed psychic's shop, buzzed like trapped insects.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, each drop a tiny, insistent hammer against the glass.  Inside, the air hung thick with the mingled scents of stale coffee, day-old hot dogs, and the faintly sweet, chemical tang of cleaning fluid.  Eleanor Vance, her name tag slightly askew on her faded blue uniform shirt, chewed thoughtfully on the end of a ballpoint pen, her gaze fixed on the rhythmic sweep of the windshield wipers across the empty street.  It was 3:17 a.m. on a Tuesday, the slowest shift of the week, and the only sound besides the rain and the buzzing lights was the low hum of the refrigerated coolers.  Eleanor sighed, pushing a loose strand of dark hair behind her ear.  This was her life, a graveyard shift in a purgatorial convenience store, and tonight, it felt particularly bleak.
