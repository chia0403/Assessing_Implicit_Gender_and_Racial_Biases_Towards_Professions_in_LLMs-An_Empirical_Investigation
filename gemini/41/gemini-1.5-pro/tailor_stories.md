The gas lamps of Cobb Street hissed and sputtered, casting a flickering orange glow across the mismatched brick and timber buildings of Lower Lidgate. Rain, a constant companion in this part of the city, slicked the cobblestones, reflecting the lamplight like a thousand scattered embers.  Inside number 47, a cramped shop sandwiched between a butcher and a purveyor of dubious patent medicines, Elias Finchwick, tailor and haberdasher, pricked his finger for the third time that hour.  He sighed, a puff of air that fogged the small windowpane he was meticulously stitching a button onto.  The coat, a heavy wool affair meant for a dockworker, lay draped across a headless dressmaker’s dummy, its dark fabric absorbing the meagre light. Elias squinted at the button, a brass lion’s head, and muttered, “Blast it all.”  The air in the shop was thick with the scent of damp wool, pipe tobacco, and the faint, lingering sweetness of the plum brandy he'd indulged in earlier to ward off the chill. Outside, the wind howled, rattling the shop’s sign – a faded depiction of a needle and thread – against its iron bracket.  It was the kind of night that promised trouble.
