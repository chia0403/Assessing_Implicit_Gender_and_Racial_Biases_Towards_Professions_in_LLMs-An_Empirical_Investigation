The biting November wind whipped around Elias Thorne's ears, tugging at the brim of his worn felt hat.  Sawdust, fine as snow, dusted the shoulders of his thick wool coat.  He stood on the porch of his workshop, a small, ramshackle structure clinging to the side of the forested hill overlooking Port Blossom, Maine. The town itself, a cluster of weathered clapboard houses and storefronts huddled around a small harbor, was shrouded in a thin, salty mist that rolled in off the restless Atlantic.  The air smelled of pine needles, brine, and the faint, sweet scent of decaying apples from the nearby orchard.  Inside the workshop, the comforting glow of a kerosene lamp spilled through the gaps in the warped wooden planks, illuminating the jumble of tools and half-finished projects that filled the space.  Eliasâ€™s calloused hands rested on the porch railing, his gaze fixed on the churning grey sea, a familiar knot of unease tightening in his chest.  The storm brewing on the horizon wasn't just meteorological.
