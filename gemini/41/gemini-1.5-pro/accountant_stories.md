Rain lashed against the ornate, leaded windows of Amelia Prudence Holloway's office, each drop a tiny, frantic drumbeat against the otherwise silent backdrop of a Sunday evening. Amelia, her normally impeccable auburn hair slightly frizzed from the damp, hunched over a stack of invoices, the green glow of her desk lamp reflecting in her wire-rimmed glasses. Her office, nestled in the attic of Grimshaw House, a crumbling Victorian manor on the outskirts of the perpetually overcast town of Hollow Creek, was usually a sanctuary of order and quiet.  Tonight, however, a disquiet hung in the air, thick and heavy as the storm clouds gathering over the moors beyond. The rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the hall below seemed to amplify the silence between the gusts, each chime a stark reminder of the rapidly approaching deadline she was struggling to meet.  Grimshaw House, bequeathed to her by a distant, eccentric aunt sheâ€™d barely known, was more of a burden than a blessing, its upkeep a constant drain on her already strained finances. And these accounts, for the notoriously difficult Lord Ashworth, were her only hope of staying afloat.
