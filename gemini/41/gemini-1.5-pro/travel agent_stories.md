Rain lashed against the window of "Wanderlust Voyages," blurring the neon pink flamingo sign into a shimmering mirage. Inside, Amelia Rose Hawthorne, her chestnut hair pulled back in a messy bun, sighed and tapped a manicured nail against her keyboard.  The travel agency, tucked between a laundromat and a perpetually empty storefront on a quiet street in Portland, Oregon, usually buzzed with the hopeful chatter of clients planning their escapes.  But tonight, the only sound was the rhythmic drumming of the rain and the occasional ping of Amelia's email notifications, each one another cancellation due to the relentless autumn storms.  The scent of stale coffee and the faint, lingering aroma of the hibiscus tea she'd brewed that morning hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the exotic destinations splashed across the vibrant travel posters that plastered the walls.  Amelia glanced at the clock: 7:48 pm. Another late night. Another night spent rescheduling honeymoons to Hawaii and backpacking trips through the Andes.  She rubbed her tired eyes and wondered if she'd ever escape this relentless downpour, let alone help anyone else do so.
