The rusty nail, slick with sweat and a thin film of pigeon guano, slipped between Elias Thorne's calloused fingers.  Below him, the sprawling patchwork of terracotta rooftops that made up the Old Quarter shimmered in the brutal midday sun. August in Valoria was always a furnace, baking the clay tiles until they radiated heat like angry embers.  Elias, perched precariously on the sloping roof of Señora Flores' bakery, wiped his forehead with the back of his equally grimy hand, leaving a streak of dirt across his sun-weathered cheek. The smell of baking bread, usually a comfort, only intensified the oppressive heat, mingling with the tarry scent of the roofing sealant he'd been applying. A dizzying wave of vertigo pulsed through him, not from the height – Elias had been scaling roofs since he could walk – but from the relentless, baking heat and the gnawing emptiness in his stomach.  He needed to finish this job, collect his meager pay, and get something to eat.  Even a stale crust of bread would be a blessing.  But a glint of something metallic, half-buried in the mortar between two tiles, caught his eye.  It wasn't another stray nail.  It looked like... gold.
