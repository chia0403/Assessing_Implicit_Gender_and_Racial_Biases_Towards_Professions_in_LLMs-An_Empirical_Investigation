The biting November wind whipped around Dr. Elias Thorne, tugging at the edges of his worn canvas coat as he trudged across the frozen farmyard.  The sky, a bruised purple-grey, threatened snow.  Beneath his boots, the churned mud had hardened into treacherous ridges, slick with ice.  The air smelled of woodsmoke and the faintly metallic tang of approaching winter.  Around him, the ramshackle buildings of the old McKinley farm huddled against the wind like a flock of frightened sheep.  Here, nestled in the heart of the Catskill Mountains, miles from the nearest town, Elias was the only thing standing between the McKinleyâ€™s livestock and whatever ills the harsh mountain winter would throw their way.
