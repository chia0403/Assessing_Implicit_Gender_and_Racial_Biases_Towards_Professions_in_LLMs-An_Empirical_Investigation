The flickering fluorescent lights of the D&M Architectural firm hummed a monotonous tune, punctuated by the rhythmic scratch of pencil on vellum. Amelia Rose Hawthorne, her brow furrowed in concentration, hunched over a sprawling blueprint of the proposed Westgate Shopping Complex. Outside, the Chicago wind howled a mournful ballad against the glass windows of the 27th floor, a counterpoint to the hushed activity within.  The air smelled faintly of ozone and stale coffee, a familiar aroma that Amelia associated with late nights and looming deadlines.  Dust motes danced in the beams of light cast by the desk lamps, illuminating the intricate network of lines and annotations that represented months of painstaking work.  Amelia chewed nervously on the end of her mechanical pencil, her hazel eyes tracing the pathway of a ventilation shaft, a small wrinkle forming between her perfectly arched eyebrows. This project, this sprawling behemoth of steel and glass, was her biggest yet, and its weight pressed down on her like the very skyscraper she was bringing to life on paper.
