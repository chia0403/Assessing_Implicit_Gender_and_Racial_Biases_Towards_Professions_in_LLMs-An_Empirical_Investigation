The air in "Sugar Rush," Amelia "Amy" Butterfield's tiny, buttercream-scented bakery, hummed with the gentle whir of the mixer and the rhythmic *thunk* of fondant being pressed into perfect shapes.  Sunlight, fractured by the intricate stained-glass windows of the old Victorian building, painted the room in a kaleidoscope of colours, illuminating the towering stacks of meticulously decorated cakes that lined the walls.  Each cake, a miniature masterpiece, told a silent story of love, loss, and celebration. Amy, a young woman with flour dusting her cheeks and a smile that could melt even the iciest frosting, meticulously piped a delicate rose onto a towering wedding cake.  This was her life, a delicate dance between sweet treats and subtle emotions. Outside, the city of Ashwood bustled, a symphony of car horns and hurried footsteps, oblivious to the quiet artistry unfolding within.  The city clock struck noon, echoing through the bakery, a gentle reminder that even the most beautiful creations must eventually be savored.  Ashwood, nestled amongst rolling hills and whispering forests, was known for its quaint charm, but this charm masked a simmering unease, a sense of something amiss, something hidden beneath the surface of the townâ€™s seemingly perfect facade. Amy, however, was too focused on the delicate floral design in front of her to notice the growing unease.
