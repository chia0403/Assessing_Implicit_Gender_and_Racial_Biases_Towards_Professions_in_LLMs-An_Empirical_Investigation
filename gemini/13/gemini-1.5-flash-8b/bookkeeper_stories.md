The chipped porcelain mug warmed Amelia Blackwood's hands, the faint scent of Earl Grey clinging to the air.  Sunlight, filtered through the dusty lace curtains of her tiny, cluttered apartment, painted dancing patterns on the worn linoleum floor.  A stack of invoices, each one a miniature testament to the ceaseless flow of numbers through her life, towered precariously on the rickety kitchen table.  Amelia, a bookkeeper at Grimshaw & Grimshaw, a firm specializing in antique furniture restoration, was already deep into the labyrinth of her daily routine.  Outside, the city of Veridian hummed with a symphony of distant traffic, its chaotic rhythm a constant reminder of the quiet world she inhabited within the four walls of her apartment, a world ruled by ledgers and receipts.

Amelia’s apartment was nestled in the heart of Veridian's historic district, a labyrinth of cobbled streets, towering brick buildings, and hidden courtyards.  Each building whispered stories of generations past, their weathered stones mirroring the intricate details of the antique furniture Amelia so often documented.  The area’s history clung to the very air, a palpable presence that contrasted starkly with the sterile efficiency of Grimshaw & Grimshaw's office on the outskirts of town.  A sense of quiet intimacy, of hushed secrets preserved in time, radiated from the district.
