The biting November wind whipped across the exposed steel skeleton of the new skyscraper, stinging Elias Thorne's cheeks.  He huddled deeper into his oversized parka, the rhythmic clang of metal on metal a constant, jarring soundtrack to his existence.

This was his world, the unforgiving rhythm of concrete, steel, and the relentless march of progress.  He was Elias Thorne, a journeyman ironworker, and his hands, calloused and scarred, were the only tools he truly needed.   The looming silhouette of the building, still under construction, was a testament to the endless demands on his strength, the relentless pressure to keep deadlines.  Every steel beam hoisted, every girder secured, brought him closer to the finish line, a finish line that seemed ever-receding. Tonight, however, the line felt impossibly distant.
