The flickering fluorescent lights of Dr. Amelia Hayes's cramped dental office hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the rhythmic *tap-tap-tap* of her dental tools.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grime-coated window, illuminating a layer of dental instruments glinting on the countertop.  The scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the faint, lingering aroma of burnt coffee and something vaguely floral that seemed to emanate from the overflowing trash can tucked beside the reception desk.  This was Amelia's sanctuary, her battlefield, her quiet purgatoryâ€”a small, cluttered space in a bustling city where the whispered anxieties of her patients echoed, almost as loud as the relentless whirring of her ancient dental drill.  The afternoon was almost over, the last few patients of the day had drifted away, and the silence that always followed was a comforting cloak of solitude.  Except for the persistent drip, drip, drip, from a leaky faucet that seemed to mock the hushed stillness.
