The biting wind, a relentless sculptor of the already skeletal trees, whipped across the cobbled plaza.  Dust, kicked up by unseen hooves, swirled like tiny, angry spirits.  Above, the grey sky, bruised and threatening, mirrored the mood of Sergeant Alistair Blackwood, standing guard at the crumbling archway of the Sunstone Gate.

The whispers, the faint, persistent rustle of unseen things in the ruined city beyond the gate, were more unnerving.  He'd been stationed here for three moons, and the city of Aeridor, once vibrant, now felt like a wounded beast, gasping for breath in the suffocating embrace of forgotten magic and forgotten terrors.
