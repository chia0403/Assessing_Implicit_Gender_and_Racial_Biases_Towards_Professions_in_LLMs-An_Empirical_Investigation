The chill of the November air seeped into Amelia Blackwood's bones as she stepped out of the physiotherapy clinic, "Rehab Rx," nestled in the shadow of the towering, snow-capped peaks of the Swiss Alps.  A biting wind whipped through the narrow cobblestone streets of the charming village of Zermatt, carrying with it the scent of pine needles and melting snow.  Amelia, a physical therapist with a practiced calm, adjusted her scarf, the crimson wool a vibrant splash against the muted greys and browns of the Alpine landscape.  Her fingers, though calloused from years of working with injured athletes and everyday individuals, still held the delicate grace of a dancer.  She considered the daunting hike ahead, the path winding up towards the Matterhorn, a legendary peak that seemed to pierce the very heavens.  This wasn't just another case.  This was personal.  Sheâ€™d promised her grandmother, whose frail hands had once guided her through the same rugged trails, she'd see this through.  This was for Elsa.
