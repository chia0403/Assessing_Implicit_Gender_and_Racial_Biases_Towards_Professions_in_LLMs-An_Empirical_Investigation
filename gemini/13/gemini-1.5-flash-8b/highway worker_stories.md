The biting wind whipped across the desolate expanse of the Wyoming plains, stinging Amelia Stone's cheeks and rattling the loose rivets in the rusted toolbox strapped to her belt.  Dust devils, miniature tornadoes of ochre and grey, danced across the cracked asphalt of Highway 280, blurring the already hazy horizon.  Sunrise, a pale, anemic ghost of orange, barely illuminated the endless, undulating landscape, painting the skeletal shapes of distant mountains in a muted watercolour. This was Amelia's domain, this vast, wind-scarred stretch of nothingness where the interstate sliced through the heart of Wyoming, a stark reminder of the country's raw, untamed beauty.  Amelia, a highway maintenance worker for the Wyoming Department of Transportation, had been on this stretch of the highway for eight years, working through sun-scorched days and bone-chilling nights, and she knew every pothole, every cracked culvert, every tremor of the earth beneath her weary feet.  Today, though, something felt different.  A strange quiet, heavy as the morning air, settled over the landscape.  Not the eerie silence of the wilderness, but somethingâ€¦emptier.
