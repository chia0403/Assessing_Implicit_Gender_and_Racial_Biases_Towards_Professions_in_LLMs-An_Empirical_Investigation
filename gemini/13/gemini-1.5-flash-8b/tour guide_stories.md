The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks as she surveyed the sprawling, grey expanse of the Yorkshire Moors.  Mist clung to the ancient stone walls of the abandoned abbey, a ghostly shroud draped over the valley.  Autumn leaves, skeletal and ochre, clung precariously to the branches, their rustling a mournful symphony in the eerie silence.  Amelia, a whirlwind of auburn curls and practiced enthusiasm, adjusted her worn leather satchel.  Today, she was leading her "Secrets of the North" tour, a pilgrimage to the haunted ruins of St. Anselm's Abbey, a place whispered about in hushed tones by locals and eagerly sought out by adventurous tourists.   The tour brochure, proclaiming a "journey into the heart of mystery," felt almost ludicrous in the face of the desolate beauty.  But Amelia knew, even in this desolate setting, she had a story to tell.  And a secret to unravel.
