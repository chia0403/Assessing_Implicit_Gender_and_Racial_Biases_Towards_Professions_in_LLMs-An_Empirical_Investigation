The biting wind howled a mournful dirge through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks that lined the perimeter of Blackwood Forest.  Rain, thick and cold, hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the Blackwood Volunteer Fire Department station, a building more weathered than the firefighters themselves.  Inside, Lieutenant Amelia "Amie"  Rivera hunched over a steaming mug of coffee, the aroma battling the scent of damp earth and pine needles that clung to the air.  Outside, the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the emergency siren, a siren that had become almost as familiar as the comforting clink of her chipped mug, punctuated the relentless storm.  Blackwood, nestled deep within the shadowed heart of the forest, was notoriously prone to sudden, ferocious fire storms, especially during the encroaching autumn months.  This particular October night felt pregnant with a danger Amie could feel in her bones.
