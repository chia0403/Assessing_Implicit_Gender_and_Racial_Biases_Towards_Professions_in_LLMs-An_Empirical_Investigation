The stale, theatrical air hung thick with the scent of sawdust and desperation.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight slicing through the grimy window of the "Thespian Troupe," a rehearsal hall more accustomed to echoes than applause.  Amelia Josephine Nightingale, her dark hair pulled back in a tight bun, surveyed the scene with a critical eye.  Twenty-four actors, a motley crew ranging from aspiring ingenues with dewy complexions to seasoned veterans with weary eyes, milled about, their energy fluctuating wildly between feverish enthusiasm and listless resignation.  Amelia, director of this fledgling troupe – a troupe struggling to survive on a diet of ramen and borrowed costumes –  felt a familiar wave of exasperation wash over her.  This production of Shakespeare's *A Midsummer Night's Dream* was, quite frankly, a disaster waiting to happen. The set, cobbled together from discarded furniture and scraps of painted cardboard, looked less like a magical forest and more like a junkyard picnic.
