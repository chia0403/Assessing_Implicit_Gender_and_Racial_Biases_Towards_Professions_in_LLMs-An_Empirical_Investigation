The fluorescent lights of Ms. Eleanor Vance's classroom hummed, a monotonous counterpoint to the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of her students' keyboards.  Eleanor, a history teacher at the prestigious but somewhat stuffy  Northwood Academy, sighed.  Another Tuesday. Another lecture on the French Revolution, another inevitable avalanche of "but what about...?" questions that felt like tiny rocks chipping away at her patience.  The worn leather of her armchair felt comforting against her weary shoulders.  Outside, the crisp autumn air, usually invigorating, felt heavy, thick with a premonition of somethingâ€¦ different.  Her neatly organized desk, a testament to her meticulous nature, seemed to mock her restlessness.  Stacks of meticulously-arranged textbooks and colourful historical posters hinted at a carefully constructed world, a world that felt increasingly fragile.  Today, however, felt particularly unsettling.   A sudden chill, not of the air, but of the atmosphere, had settled over the room.  The usual chatter of the class had fallen silent, replaced by an almost palpable tension.
