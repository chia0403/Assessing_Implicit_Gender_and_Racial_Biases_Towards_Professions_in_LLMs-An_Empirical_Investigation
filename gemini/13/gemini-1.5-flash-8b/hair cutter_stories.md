The chipped porcelain sink of "Scissors & Smiles" gleamed under the harsh fluorescent lights, reflecting the frantic rhythm of Amelia Blackwood's movements.  She expertly snipped, the rhythmic *snip* echoing through the small, cluttered salon.  Amelia, a wisp of a woman with perpetually windblown auburn hair, was a whirlwind of focused energy, her hands flying over the vibrant crimson locks of a client.  Outside, the grey London sky mirrored the muted palette of the salon itself, a stark contrast to the kaleidoscope of colours that bloomed in her creations.

Scissors & Smiles wasn't a high-end salon, nor was it a trendy, Instagrammable space.  Tucked away on a quiet side street, nestled between a fishmonger and a failing bakery, it was a haven of quiet chaos.  Dusty magazines on the waiting area's wooden table covered topics ranging from vintage fashion to the latest in dog grooming techniques.  The faded floral wallpaper hinted at a time when the building held a different purpose, possibly a cozy home.  A single, sputtering potted plant on the counter was the only splash of life amidst the subdued atmosphere.  A soft, almost melancholic jazz tune drifted from the ancient gramophone hidden in a corner.  This was Amelia's sanctuary, her kingdom of snips and shears, where she transformed strands of hair into a fleeting expression of the soul.
