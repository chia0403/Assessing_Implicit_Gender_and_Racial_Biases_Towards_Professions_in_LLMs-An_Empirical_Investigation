The flickering neon sign of the "Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow over Amelia "Amy" Blackwood's worn apron.

Amy, with her perpetually tired eyes and calloused hands, knew them all, or at least, she knew the stories they carried. Tonight, though, a new face, a newcomer to Veridian, was seated alone at the bar, a figure wrapped in a heavy cloak that hid everything but sharp, curious eyes.  The air, usually thick with whispered secrets and the clinking of glasses, felt oddly quiet.  Amy, ever observant, took a sip of her own bitter whiskey, the metallic tang a familiar comfort against the unsettling quiet.
