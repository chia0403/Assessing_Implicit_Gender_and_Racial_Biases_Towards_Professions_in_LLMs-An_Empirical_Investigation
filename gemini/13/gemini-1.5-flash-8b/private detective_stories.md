The flickering neon sign of the "Rusty Mug" cast a sickly yellow glow across the rain-slicked cobblestones of the Lower Quarter.  A chill wind, sharp and insistent, whipped through the narrow alleyways, carrying with it the pungent aroma of roasting chestnuts and stale beer.  This was the heart of the city's underbelly, a labyrinth of shadowed streets and whispered secrets, where Amelia "Ace"  Fitzwilliam, Private Investigator, felt utterly, and rather comfortably, at home.

Ace, a woman built like a sturdy oak, with eyes that could pierce the fog of a thousand lies, hunched deeper into her trench coat.  The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof above her, a relentless percussion against the quiet hum of the city's nocturnal pulse.  A single, flickering streetlamp cast long, dancing shadows that seemed to writhe with a silent malice.  In her hand, she clutched a chipped porcelain teacup, its faded floral design a stark contrast to the grim reality of the case that awaited her within the dimly lit interior of the Rusty Mug.
