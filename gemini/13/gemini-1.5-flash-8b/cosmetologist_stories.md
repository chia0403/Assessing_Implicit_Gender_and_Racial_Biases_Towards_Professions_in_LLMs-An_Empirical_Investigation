The flickering neon sign of "Crimson Curls," a salon nestled on the bustling corner of Elm and Ash, cast a sickly pink glow on Amelia Hawthorne's face.  Rain lashed against the corrugated metal awning, mimicking the tempest brewing inside her.  Amelia, a cosmetologist with hands as deft as they were calloused, stared at the chipped porcelain sink, the reflection of her own weary face staring back.  The salon, usually buzzing with the chatter of happy clients and the rhythmic whirring of hairdryers, was eerily quiet.  It was a Tuesday night, a night normally packed with appointments for the Friday night social scene. Tonight, only the persistent drip of a leaky faucet kept Amelia company.

The salon itself was a relic of a bygone era, its faded floral wallpaper and mismatched armchairs hinting at a time when hairstyles were as elaborate as the city's architectural flourishes.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of moonlight filtering through the grimy window, highlighting the faded portraits of previous salon owners, their smiles as fixed as the faded paint on the walls.  A faint scent of stale coffee and old hairspray hung heavy in the air, a scent Amelia knew intimately, a scent that often masked the underlying anxieties of her clientele.  Tonight, however, the scent was amplified, almost suffocating, leaving her feeling as though the past was trying to catch up to her.
