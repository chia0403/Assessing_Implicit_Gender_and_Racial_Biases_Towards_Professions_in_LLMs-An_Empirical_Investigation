The biting wind whipped across the barren plains of the Alaskan tundra, stinging Amelia Blackwood's cheeks and rattling the rusted metal of the outbuilding that housed the "Arctic Ascent" sled dog training camp.  Snow, the colour of crushed diamonds, blanketed everything in a silent, unforgiving shroud.  The year was 1929.  Amelia, a wisp of a woman with eyes the colour of glacier ice and a will forged in the fires of hardship, huddled deeper into her worn leather coat.  Around her, the huskies, sleek and powerful, strained against their tethers, their breath misting in the frigid air.  The rhythmic thump of their paws, a low, insistent drumming, was the only sound that broke the oppressive silence. This was her domain, her sanctuary, her battlefield.  This was where she sculpted champions from untamed wilderness.  A champion, or rather, *champions*, was her obsession.
