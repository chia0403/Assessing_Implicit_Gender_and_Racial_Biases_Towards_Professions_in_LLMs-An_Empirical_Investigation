She was a cook, yes, but more than that, she was the heart of the Rusty Spoon, a tiny flame trying to keep the dying embers of Oakhaven's spirit alive. Outside, the wind howled, carrying with it the whispers of a town that seemed to be fading into the mists of time, leaving behind only a handful of weathered souls and a diner that clung to the promise of a meal.
