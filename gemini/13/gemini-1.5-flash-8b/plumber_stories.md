The flickering neon sign of "The Leaky Faucet," barely clinging to life above the grimy storefront, cast a sickly yellow glow on Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield.  Barty, a plumber with a perpetually surprised expression and hands perpetually covered in grease, peered through the rain-streaked window.  The alley smelled of damp earth and something vaguely floral – likely a poorly-maintained dumpster overflowing with neglected blossoms.  Tonight's call was particularly unusual. Not a burst pipe or a clogged drain, but a leak in the spiritual plane, it seemed.

Setting:

Rain lashed against the chipped paint of the buildings lining the narrow, cobbled alleyways of Old Quarter.  Brick facades, darkened by centuries of grime, stood sentinel over the damp, shadowed streets.  Twisted iron lampposts, their gaslights sputtering weakly, offered only a partial illumination, leaving pools of inky blackness in their wake. The air, thick with the scent of mildew and aged wood, clung to the alley like a damp shroud.  The Old Quarter wasn't for the faint of heart or the easily disturbed.  Whispers of forgotten lore and whispered tales of magic circulated through the narrow, twisting streets, carrying an undercurrent of unease that had settled deep within the very stones. Barty, however, was used to the unsettling whispers. His job often led him to the edges of the ordinary, and tonight felt unusually…thin.
