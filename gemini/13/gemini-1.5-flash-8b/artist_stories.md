The biting November wind whipped Amelia Nightingale's charcoal-grey coat around her legs as she navigated the cobbled alleyways of Montmartre.  Dust motes, illuminated by the fading light of the setting sun, danced in the air, mirroring the swirling chaos in her mind.  Each chipped brick, each shadowed doorway, seemed to hold a secret, a whispered story waiting to be drawn from the fading light.  Amelia, a portrait painter with a reputation as sharp as her charcoal, sought the raw energy of the city's twilight hours, a time when the veil between reality and imagination thinned to almost nothing.  This particular evening held a particularly insistent whisper, an image demanding to be captured, to be made real on the surface of her canvas.  The air hung thick with the scent of woodsmoke from nearby studios, mingled with the intoxicating aroma of roasted chestnuts and the faint, metallic tang of somethingâ€¦unnatural.  The alley, usually teeming with the colourful chatter of artists and patrons, was unusually quiet.  This was the time when the city surrendered to the night, and Amelia, with her worn sketchbook and charcoal pencils, became its silent observer.
