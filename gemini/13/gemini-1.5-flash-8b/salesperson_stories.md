The fluorescent lights of the "Everything You Need" superstore hummed, a monotonous drone that seemed to vibrate through Amelia Blackwood's very bones.  Dust motes danced in the harsh glare, illuminating the rows of beige shelving units crammed with everything from artisanal pickles to industrial-strength duct tape.
