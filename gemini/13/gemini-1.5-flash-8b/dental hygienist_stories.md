The fluorescent hum of the dental clinic buzzed, a constant, low thrum that vibrated through Amelia Rose Blackwood's polished steel tools.  Dust motes danced in the pale morning light filtering through the grime-streaked windows, illuminating the rows of identical beige examination chairs like miniature torture devices.  Amelia, a dental hygienist with eyes the colour of polished granite and a smile that promised more than just a clean bill of health, meticulously polished a patient's teeth.  The patient, a woman named Mrs. Henderson with a face etched with the stories of a lifetime, sighed, her breath misting in the cool air.  Amelia's attention, however, wasn't fully on the intricate work before her.  A whisper of something else, something urgent, lingered at the edges of her awareness. Something tied to the persistent, almost palpable hum of the clinic, something unsettlingly familiar.  The setting: a small, run-down dental practice nestled on the fringes of a city where the past clung to the present like stubborn plaque.
