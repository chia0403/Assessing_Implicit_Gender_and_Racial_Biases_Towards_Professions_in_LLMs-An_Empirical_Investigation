The chipped paint of the easel, a sickly yellow that mirrored the gloom clinging to the cobblestone alley, scraped against Elias Thorne's calloused fingers.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single, flickering gas lamp hanging precariously from a rusted iron hook, danced in the meagre light, swirling like forgotten dreams.  Rain, a relentless, icy curtain, hammered against the crumbling stone walls of the alley, echoing the tremor in Elias's own chest.  He was in the heart of the Marais, Paris, 1889, a labyrinth of narrow passages and hidden courtyards, a city that both cradled and suffocated him with its beauty and its poverty.  The scent of damp earth, mingled with the acrid tang of coal smoke from nearby workshops, hung heavy in the air.  Elias, his name a whisper in this hushed, unforgiving space, was drowning in a world of muted colours and unspoken anxieties.
