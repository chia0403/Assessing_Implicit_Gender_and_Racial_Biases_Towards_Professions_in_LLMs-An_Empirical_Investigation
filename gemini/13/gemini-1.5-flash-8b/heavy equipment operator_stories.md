The biting wind, a relentless prairie wolf, howled across the cracked earth of the Dakota Badlands.  Dust devils danced like frantic imps, swirling ochre clouds that momentarily obscured the skeletal, eroded peaks.  Fifty-two-year-old  Jeremiah "Jerr"  McDowell, his face weathered and lined like a forgotten map, hunched over the controls of the Caterpillar 992H.

He was a heavy equipment operator, a silent sculptor of the earth, and today, the task was a particularly brutal one â€“ excavating a collapsed section of the abandoned Crow's Nest mine.  The rusted metal cage of the mine entrance, a gaping maw in the sandstone, loomed like a monstrous, skeletal tooth against the bruised twilight sky. This particular stretch of the Badlands was notorious for its volatile history, not just of rock, but of rumors and whispers of long-buried secrets.
