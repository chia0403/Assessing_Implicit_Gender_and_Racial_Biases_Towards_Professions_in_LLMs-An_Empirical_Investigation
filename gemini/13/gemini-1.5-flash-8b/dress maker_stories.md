The scent of beeswax and old linen hung heavy in the air of Elara's workshop, a tiny space tucked between a cobbled alley and a bustling market square.

Elara,  Seraphina Elara,  a dressmaker renowned for her exquisite gowns,  was hunched over a miniature mountain of meticulously sorted silks and satins.  A delicate lace doily, painstakingly embroidered with forget-me-nots, lay beside her, half-finished.  The rhythmic tap-tap-tap of her needle echoed softly against the quiet hum of the city outside.  Veridia pulsed with life – merchants hawking their wares, children chasing pigeons, and the low rumble of carts on the cobblestones.  But inside Elara's workshop, a quiet symphony of fabric and thread played out, a world apart from the clamor of the outside world.  Today, however, a distinct tremor in the air – a mixture of anticipation and apprehension –  had her heart hammering against her ribs.  A most important commission awaited her.
