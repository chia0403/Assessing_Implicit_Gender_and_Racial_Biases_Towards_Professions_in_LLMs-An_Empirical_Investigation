The biting November wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's lab coat around her legs as she hurried across the rain-slicked parking lot of St. Jude's Community Clinic.  The fluorescent lights of the building, a pale yellow smear against the encroaching twilight, seemed to mock the chill seeping into her bones.  Inside, the scent of antiseptic and stale coffee hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort compared to the raw, unforgiving elements outside. Amy, a Physician's Assistant at St. Jude's for the past three years, knew the rhythm of the clinic like the back of her hand: the hurried footsteps in the hallways, the hushed consultations, the occasional burst of laughter from the waiting room.  Tonight, however, the air hummed with an unusual tension.  A particularly rough week had ended on an ominous note.  A rash of flu cases was rapidly escalating, overwhelming the already strained resources, and a cryptic phone call from the county health department earlier that afternoon had left the staff on edge.  Amy knew she was going to be up late.
