The flickering fluorescent lights of the waiting room cast long, distorted shadows across the worn floral carpet.  A faint scent of antiseptic and stale coffee hung heavy in the air, a constant companion to Dr. Eleanor Vance, Counseling Psychologist.  Eleanor, her name a quiet counterpoint to the restless energy of the patients who drifted in and out of the small, beige-walled office, adjusted the strap of her worn leather tote.  Today, it held not just the usual assortment of clinical files and journals, but also a small, intricately carved wooden bird, a gift from a past patient. It sat nestled amongst her papers, a silent observer of the anxieties and hopes that flooded her office.

The setting was the quiet, almost anonymous, corner office of a community mental health clinic nestled in the heart of a sprawling, somewhat decaying, industrial town called Ashwood.  Grey skies, a constant companion to the town, mirrored the melancholic atmosphere of the waiting room. The rhythmic clack of machinery from a nearby factory, a distant but persistent hum, seemed to vibrate with the unspoken tensions of the people who sought refuge within these walls.  This was a place where the quiet hum of the factory engine often sounded more comforting than the silence between patients and therapists, a space where the ghosts of unspoken traumas lingered in the air, as palpable as the scent of steel and rain.
