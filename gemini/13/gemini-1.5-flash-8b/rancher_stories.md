The wind, a relentless, icy hand, whipped across the vast expanse of the Montana plains, stinging Jedediah "Jed" Blackwood's cheeks.  Dust devils, the skeletal fingers of the drought, danced across the cracked earth, swirling the meager remains of the summer's meager crops into a hazy oblivion.  The year was 1887, and the Blackwood ranch, nestled in the shadow of the rugged Beartooth Mountains, felt more like a monument to despair than a haven.  Twisted, skeletal pines clawed at the bruised sky, their branches like skeletal fingers reaching for a rain that seemed to have abandoned the land.  Jed, his face weathered and etched with lines that spoke of years of harsh living, stared out at the desolate landscape.  The relentless wind rattled the worn, wooden cabin, its occupants – Jed and his aging, ailing mother, Elara – the only witnesses to the merciless season's cruel symphony.  His worn leather boots crunched on the gravel as he approached the dilapidated corral, a grim testament to the ranch's failing fortunes.  Water was the lifeblood of the land, and this year, the lifeblood had run dry.
