The fluorescent lights of the "Tax Time Express" hummed, a monotonous soundtrack to Amelia Nightingale's workday.  Paperclips clicked, staplers zipped, and the rhythmic clack of her keyboard echoed through the tiny office, a miniature symphony of tax season chaos.  Amelia, a precise woman with a perpetually tired smile and hair pulled back in a tight bun, meticulously filled out form 1040s, navigating the labyrinthine complexities of deductions and credits.  Outside, the crisp autumn air carried the scent of falling leaves and the distant rumble of construction.  Her small, cluttered office, crammed with overflowing file cabinets and stacks of tax documents, was located in a nondescript strip mall on the outskirts of the rapidly growing city of Oakhaven.  A single potted fern, stubbornly clinging to life in a corner, was the only touch of greenery amidst the beige walls and beige carpeting. Amelia, whose name, a slight twist on the classical, felt both elegant and understated, felt as though she were caught in a relentless cycle, a tax-season cog grinding on in the ever-turning machine of personal finances.
