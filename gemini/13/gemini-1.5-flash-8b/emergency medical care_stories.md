The biting wind whipped Amelia Kensingtonâ€™s hair across her face as she wrestled the battered ambulance into the narrow, cobbled street.

Rain, a relentless curtain, plastered the already grimy walls of the old townhouses to a mirror-like sheen.  This wasn't exactly the picturesque Alpine village brochures boasted about.  This was a hidden, forgotten pocket of the Swiss Alps, a place where centuries-old legends whispered through the mist and the ancient stone spoke of secrets buried deep beneath the earth.  Amelia, Emergency Medical Care Technician, knew she'd stumbled into something more than just a routine call.

The village, nestled amongst towering pines and jagged peaks, felt cloaked in an oppressive stillness.  Windows, dark and opaque, stared out like hollow eyes. The rhythmic clang of a distant church bell seemed to echo the pounding in her temples.  She'd been dispatched to respond to an unspecified medical emergency, only given the name "Villa Alder."  That was all.  The single-word location, coupled with the unnerving silence, sent a shiver down her spine.  She was alone, apart from the increasingly frantic beeping of her equipment and the silent, ominous presence of the Alpine village.
