Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Dr. Alistair Finch's clinic, a relentless drumming that mirrored the throbbing ache in his own temples.  The small, cluttered office, tucked away on a side street in the gritty heart of the industrial district of Oakhaven, smelled faintly of antiseptic and stale coffee.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight piercing the grime-coated window.  A chipped ceramic mug sat beside a stack of X-rays, the faded floral pattern a stark contrast to the skeletal remains captured within.  Dr. Alistair Finch, a chiropractor with eyes the colour of stormy seas, leaned back in his worn leather chair, tracing the lines of a particularly gnarled bone image with a pencil.  The persistent rain outside seemed to mimic the relentless pressure building within him.  He'd been working twelve-hour days for the past week, each session a silent battle against the unseen forces that seemed to be pulling patients, and perhaps himself, apart.
