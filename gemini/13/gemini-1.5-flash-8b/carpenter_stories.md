The chipped paint of the workshop door, a sickly shade of ochre, mocked the relentless drizzle that hammered against the corrugated iron roof.  Inside, Elias Thorne, a carpenter with hands weathered to the colour of aged mahogany, wrestled with a stubborn knot in a piece of seasoned oak.  Sunlight, fractured and weak, pierced the gloom through the grime-streaked window, illuminating sawdust motes dancing in the air.  Elias, his brow furrowed in concentration, swore softly under his breath.  The workshop, tucked away at the edge of the sprawling, rain-slicked docks of Port Blackwood, held a peculiar stillness amidst the constant clatter and cries of the city.  Boxes of unfinished furniture lined the walls, their surfaces gleaming with anticipation, awaiting their final shape.  Elias’s tools – a hammer, a saw, a plane – each a testament to years of hard work, lay scattered across a workbench, almost a silent orchestra in its arrangement.  His weathered apron, stained dark with years of wood dust, clung to his form, as if the workshop itself had absorbed his labour. Outside, the ceaseless rhythm of the rain and the low groan of the ships on the harbor was the only soundtrack to Elias’s struggle with the wood.
