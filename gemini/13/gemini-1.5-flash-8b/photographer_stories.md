Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the "Lost Souls" photography studio, mirroring the turmoil within Amelia Blackwood's soul.  The scent of stale coffee and old paper, a constant companion in the cramped, cluttered space, hung heavy in the air.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of pale light slicing through the gloom, illuminating chipped paint and forgotten negatives scattered across overflowing trays. Amelia, a wisp of a woman with eyes the colour of storm clouds and hair like tangled seaweed, hunched over a battered wooden table.  Empty film canisters, each one a miniature tomb of lost moments, littered the surface around her.  The studio, nestled deep within the shadowed alleyways of the forgotten district of Oldport, was a monument to forgotten stories, whispered tales, and the haunting beauty of a city draped in perpetual twilight.
