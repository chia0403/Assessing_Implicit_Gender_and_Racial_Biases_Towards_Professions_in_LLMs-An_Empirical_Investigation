The fluorescent hum of the I-95 rest stop was a constant, low thrum against the backdrop of Amelia "Ace"  Harding's tinnitus.  It wasn't the rumble of the rig that plagued her, not this time.  This was a different kind of echo, a persistent, metallic clang within her skull.  She squinted at the peeling paint of the chipped picnic table, the faded floral print on the beige vinyl booths.  The whole place smelled faintly of stale coffee and something akin to antiseptic – a scent that, in this moment, felt eerily familiar.  It was a scent that should not have clung to the air so close to the bustling, gritty reality of the highway.

Ace, her weathered face etched with the lines of a thousand miles and sleepless nights, checked the time on her phone.  3:17 AM.  Another hour to go before dawn. Another hour to try and outrun the phantom ringing. Another hour to wrestle with the gnawing feeling that something… *wrong*… had taken root in the heart of her otherwise meticulously-organized life.

**Setting:** A deserted, slightly run-down I-95 rest stop in the early morning hours just as dawn is breaking.  The overall atmosphere is a mix of sterile, mechanical hum of the highway and an unsettling sense of something unseen, hinting at a deeper, unresolved problem.
