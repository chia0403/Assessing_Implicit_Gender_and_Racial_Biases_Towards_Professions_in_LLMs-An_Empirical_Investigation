The chipped porcelain sink, stained a perpetual, muddy brown, reflected the flickering gaslight above Bartholomew "Barty" Grimshaw's head.  He leaned over it, his calloused hands, stained crimson from the recent butchering, scrubbing away at a stubborn smear of blood.  The air in the cramped, back-alley shop hung thick with the aroma of cloves, garlic, and something vaguely metallic that clung to the very fabric of the space, even clinging to the threadbare drapes that barely masked the grime-covered brick walls.  A single, flickering candle on the counter cast long, dancing shadows that danced across the rows of gleaming knives and cleavers, their polished steel glinting eerily in the dim light.

Outside, the cobbled streets of Spitalfields were awash in the sickly yellow glow of the gas lamps, their flickering flames punctuated by the rhythmic clang of a distant blacksmith's hammer and the low cries of hawkers advertising their wares. The scent of roasting meat wafted from neighboring stalls, a tantalizing counterpoint to the pungent, almost sickening smell emanating from Barty's own shop,  "Grimshaw's Finest Cuts."  It was a Thursday night in 1888, and Barty, despite the grime and the late hour, felt a knot of unease tightening in his stomach.  This particular Thursday night felt different.  The air, normally thick with the jostling energy of the market, felt unusually still.
