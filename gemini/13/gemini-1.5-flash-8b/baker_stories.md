The chipped porcelain sign, painted a faded but cheerful robin's egg blue, hung precariously over the bakery door.  It proclaimed, in slightly crooked script, "Le Petit Fournils of Ambroise."  Rain hammered against the corrugated tin roof of the bakery, a relentless percussion that echoed the frantic rhythm of Ambroise Dubois's heart.  He was late.  Very late.  The aroma of freshly baked sourdough, usually a comforting presence in the tiny, cobbled Parisian alleyway, was today overshadowed by the sharp tang of fear.  He glanced at the overflowing basket of pastries, each delicate creation a tiny monument to his frantic morning.  He needed to get these into the hands of Monsieur Leclerc, the esteemed patron of Le Petit Fournils, before the curfew.  

The setting was a narrow, damp alleyway, tucked between a crumbling tenement building on one side and a high, brick wall on the other.  A perpetual drizzle clung to the air, dampening the cobblestones and making the wrought-iron lampposts look ghostly.  The scent of damp earth and dampened wood permeated the air, mingling with the yeasty, sweet fragrance of the bakery.  Inside Le Petit Fournils, the counter was already a flurry of activity, a stark contrast to the quiet gloom of the alleyway. The warm glow from the small, oil-lamp lit oven cast dancing shadows across the countertop.  Small, hand-painted tiles on the wall depicted various pastries and fruits; a testament to Ambroise's love of artistry and the beauty of his craft.  The rhythmic click of his wooden spoon against the mixing bowl, the sizzle of butter on the griddle, all seemed to be racing against the relentless rhythm of the rain.
