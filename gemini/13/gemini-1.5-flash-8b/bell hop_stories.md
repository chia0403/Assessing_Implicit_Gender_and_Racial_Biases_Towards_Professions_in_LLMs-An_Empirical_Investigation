The brass bell, polished to a blinding sheen, echoed faintly in the cavernous lobby of the Grand Imperial Hotel.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of afternoon sunlight piercing the gloom, highlighting the ornate, faded floral wallpaper.  This was the domain of Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield, bellhop extraordinaire (or so he liked to think), and today, the hotel was anything but extraordinary.  A biting wind howled outside, rattling the enormous windows, and the only sound louder than the rhythmic drip-drip-drip of the leaky fountain in the courtyard was the mournful sigh of the hotel itself, seemingly weary from the relentless march of seasons and the endless parade of inconsiderate tourists.  Barty, a lanky youth with eyes the colour of storm clouds, meticulously polished a brass tray, his brow furrowed in concentration. The year was 1928.
