The biting wind whipped across the exposed peaks of the Chiricahua Mountains, stinging Silas Blackwood's cheeks and rattling the loose boards in the dilapidated cabin.  Snow, a stark contrast to the normally vibrant desert landscape, clung to the pines like frosted lace.  Dust devils danced across the parched earth, swirling the remnants of last year's fire into a choking haze.  Silas, a man weathered as deeply as the canyons surrounding him, shivered despite the layers of flannel and leather that draped him. He was alone, as always, except for the creaks and groans of the aging cabin, voices of a mountain long dormant.  The year was 1928.
