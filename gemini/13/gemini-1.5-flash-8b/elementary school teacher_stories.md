The chipped paint of the Ms. Amelia Carmichael’s classroom door, a faded shade of robin’s egg blue, seemed to sigh with the humid afternoon air.  Sunlight, fractured by the dense canopy of ancient oak trees outside, dappled the worn wooden floor in shifting patterns of light and shadow.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the window, illuminating a half-eaten granola bar clutched in the tiny hand of a particularly boisterous student named Leo.  The air hummed with the low thrum of whispered conversations, the soft rustle of paper, and the occasional, sharp clatter of a pencil against a worn desk.  This was Ms. Carmichael’s third-grade classroom at Oakhaven Elementary, a place where the scent of crayons and sticky notes mingled with the ever-present, slightly musty aroma of old books and forgotten dreams.
