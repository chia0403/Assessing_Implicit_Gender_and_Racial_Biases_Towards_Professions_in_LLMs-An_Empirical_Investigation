The biting wind whipped Amelia Blackwood's scarf around her neck, stinging her cheeks like a thousand tiny needles.  She squinted at the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks that clawed at the bruised, grey sky, their gnarled fingers tracing the outline of the crumbling manor house nestled deep within the Valley of Whispers.  This wasn't the lush, verdant landscape she usually craved, but the estate, "Hawthorn Hall," demanded her attention.  The groundskeeper had called in sick, and the Hall's demanding, and notoriously fickle, owner, Lady Eleanor Ashworth, was expecting a miracle.  Amelia, whose business card proudly proclaimed her as "Amelia Blackwood, Artisan of Green,"  had a reputation for exceeding expectations, even—especially—when faced with impossible tasks.

The Valley of Whispers lived up to its name.  Ancient stone walls, interwoven with gnarled ivy, enclosed the property.  Towering, moss-covered pines clung to the steep, rocky slopes, their needles whispering secrets to the wind.  A thick mist, perpetually clinging to the valley floor, veiled the landscape in an ethereal gloom.  Even the light seemed to shimmer, refracting and twisting through the damp air.  The valley itself was a symphony of muted colours: muted greens, muted browns, muted grays.  The only vibrant hues came from the sporadic bursts of colour Amelia hoped to introduce, the vibrant bursts of wildflowers she planned to coax from the desolate landscape.  It was a challenge, a canvas painted in shades of neglect, and Amelia, with her clippers, her trowel, and her unwavering optimism, was ready to transform it.
