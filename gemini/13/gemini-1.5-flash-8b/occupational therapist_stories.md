Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the abandoned hospital, a relentless rhythm that mirrored the pounding in Elara Nightingale’s temples.  The air hung thick with the scent of mildew and disinfectant, a ghostly perfume clinging to the chipped paint and dust-coated equipment.  Elara, Occupational Therapist, felt the familiar knot tightening in her chest.  This wasn't your typical assessment.  This was… different.

The setting was the crumbling remnants of Saint Jude's Rehabilitation Hospital, a once-proud institution now swallowed by the encroaching jungle.  Ivy snaked its way up the peeling walls, whispering secrets to the rusted machinery.  Broken wheelchairs lay scattered like discarded toys, their once-bright chrome now dulled and tarnished by time and neglect.  Sunlight, fractured and weak, struggled to pierce the dense canopy overhead, casting long, skeletal shadows across the empty corridors. The air hung heavy with the unspoken stories of patients who had walked these very halls, their triumphs and tragedies lost to the decay around them. A single, flickering fluorescent light hung precariously above the examination room, casting harsh shadows on Elara's weary face.  It was the only source of light, and it seemed to mock her with its stark brilliance.
