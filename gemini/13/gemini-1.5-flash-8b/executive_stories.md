The sterile, beige-toned walls of the executive boardroom seemed to press in on Amelia Hawthorne, CEO of Hawthorne Industries.  Sunlight, fractured by the strategically placed frosted glass, cast dancing shadows across the polished mahogany table.  A half-eaten breakfast croissant, abandoned amidst a mountain of reports, sat like a monument to the relentless pace of the day.  Outside, the bustling city of Neo-Veridia thrummed with a cacophony of sirens, construction, and the low hum of automated vehicles. Amelia, though accustomed to the relentless demands of her position, felt a tremor of unease, a phantom chill that had nothing to do with the air conditioning.  The quarterly report, nestled within a leather-bound folder, was her current nemesis. Its figures, despite her team's meticulous work, whispered of troubling trends.  A potential loss of market share?  An unexpected spike in production costs?  Or something far more insidious?  Amelia knew the pressure of her responsibilities; the weight of the Hawthorne legacy, built over generations, pressed down on her shoulders like a concrete ceiling.  The clock on the wall ticked, each second a hammer blow against the impending deadline.
