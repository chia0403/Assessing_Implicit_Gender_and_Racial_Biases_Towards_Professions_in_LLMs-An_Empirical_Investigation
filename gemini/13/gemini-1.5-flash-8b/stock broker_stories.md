The fluorescent lights of the "Apex Securities" trading floor hummed, a relentless, insectoid drone that vibrated through Amelia Blackwood's bones.  Concrete, polished to a blinding sheen, reflected the chaotic dance of market tickers, each flashing a new price, a new fluctuation, a new opportunity (or, more likely, a new loss).  The air, thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, hung heavy with the unspoken anxieties of the room.  Amelia, a stock broker with an unnervingly calm demeanor despite the frenetic activity around her, adjusted her meticulously tailored suit, the crisp fabric a stark contrast to the sweat beading on her brow.  She was known for her precise calculations, her ability to dissect market trends with a surgeon's eye, but even her practiced composure felt frayed at the edges.  Today, however, was different.  Today, something feltâ€¦off.
