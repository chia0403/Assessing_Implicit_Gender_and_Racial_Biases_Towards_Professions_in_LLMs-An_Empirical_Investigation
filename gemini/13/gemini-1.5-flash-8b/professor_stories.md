Professor Alistair Finch, a man whose tweed jacket seemed perpetually dusted with the faintest grey of forgotten libraries and the scent of old paper, stared out the rain-streaked window of his study.  The autumnal air, thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, pressed against the small, ivy-covered cottage nestled deep within the whispering woods of Blackwood Manor.  Rain hammered against the leaded glass, a relentless percussion that mirrored the frantic rhythm of his thoughts.  Alistair, usually a man of meticulous order, found himself adrift in a sea of unanswered questions, his carefully constructed world threatening to crumble around him.  Outside, the woods seemed to hold their breath, the only sound the ceaseless drumming of the storm. The library, his sanctuary and refuge, was now a battlefield of papers, books, and half-written notes, a stark contrast to the normally serene arrangement of knowledge that graced its shelves. The air was thick with the aroma of pipe tobacco and something else...something indefinably unsettling.
