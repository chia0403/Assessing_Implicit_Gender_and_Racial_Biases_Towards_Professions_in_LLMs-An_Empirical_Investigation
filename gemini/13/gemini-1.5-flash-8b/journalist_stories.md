The flickering neon sign of the "Midnight Moon Diner" cast a sickly yellow glow across Amelia Hayes's worn trench coat.  Rain, a relentless, icy curtain, hammered against the corrugated steel roof of the dilapidated building, mirroring the storm raging inside Amelia.  She stared at the chipped Formica table, the remnants of a lukewarm coffee staining it, and the half-eaten plate of greasy diner food.  It was 2:17 AM, and the only other patrons were a couple hunched over a booth, lost in the shadows, their whispered conversations swallowed by the relentless downpour.  Amelia, a seasoned investigative journalist for the *Phoenix Gazette*, was supposed to be interviewing Silas Blackwood, the reclusive developer rumored to be behind the controversial Blackwood Heights project.  But Blackwood was nowhere to be found.  He'd vanished without a trace, leaving Amelia with a growing sense of unease and a gut feeling that this was a much bigger story than she'd initially imagined.


The setting:  A small, forgotten town nestled in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains in Washington State.  The town, once a thriving lumber town, was now struggling to survive.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and pine, the smell compounded by the acrid tang of smoke from the nearby Blackwood Heights construction site.  This area, previously untouched wilderness, was now a landscape of earth-moving machinery and stark, unyielding concrete.  The clash between the old and the new, between nature and progress, was palpable, and Amelia felt it keenly.
