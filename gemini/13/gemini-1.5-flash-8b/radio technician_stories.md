The flickering neon sign of "The Rusty Sprocket" cast a sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked cobblestones of Oldport.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the workshop, a rhythmic counterpoint to the low hum of electricity that filled the air.  Inside, amidst a tangle of wires, salvaged parts, and the faint scent of solder and ozone,  Amelia Cavendish, Radio Technician Extraordinaire, meticulously adjusted a complex array of dials and knobs.  Her name, whispered among the regulars of Oldport's flea markets and forgotten alleys, was synonymous with precision and the uncanny ability to coax life from broken electronics.  Tonight, however, a different kind of hum resonated within the workshop, a low, almost imperceptible thrumming that accompanied the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Amelia's fingers against the control panel.  It was a sound that spoke of something ancient, somethingâ€¦wrong.
