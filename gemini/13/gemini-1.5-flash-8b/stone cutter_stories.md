The chill wind, biting through the thin fabric of Elias Thorne's worn leather coat, whipped across the jagged peaks of the Grey Mountains.  Dust, kicked up by the relentless wind, swirled around him like a gritty, miniature blizzard.  High above, the sun, a pale disc struggling against the overcast sky, cast long, skeletal shadows across the vast, grey expanse of the quarry.  Elias Thorne, his weathered hands calloused and cracked, hammered with practiced precision against the cold, ancient stone.  He was a stone cutter, a sculptor of the mountain itself, a solitary craftsman in a land sculpted by hardship and time.  This quarry, known as the Heartstone, was his domain, a place of echoing silence punctuated only by the rhythmic clang of his hammer and the mournful groan of the stone as it yielded to his will.  His task today was the most challenging yet: to carve a likeness of the legendary Gryphon, a creature said to guard the secrets of the mountain's heart.  The image, etched onto a block of obsidian nearly as old as the mountain itself, shimmered with a faint, internal light, as if a living soul pulsed within the dark stone.  The whispers of the quarry, tales carried on the wind and etched into the very stone, spoke of the immense responsibility that came with this task, of the legends whispered across the land that were tied to the Gryphon, and of the price that could be paid for failure.
