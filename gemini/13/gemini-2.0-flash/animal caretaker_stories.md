## Story Opening

The persistent buzz of the fluorescent lights hummed a counterpoint to the rhythmic crunch of Wilfred Theodore Finchley’s boots on the gravel path. Dawn was barely a suggestion in the inky sky above the Whispering Pines Animal Sanctuary, painting the landscape in shades of grey. Wilfred, his breath puffing out in little white clouds, pulled his worn, green parka tighter around him. He could already smell the damp earth, the faintly sweet scent of hay, and the ever-present, earthy musk of a thousand different animals stirring awake. He shivered, partly from the cold, partly from the anticipation. Every morning at Whispering Pines was a fresh start, a chance to make a difference in the lives of the creatures entrusted to his care. He just hoped Bartholomew, the notoriously grumpy badger with a penchant for biting, was feeling cooperative today.
## Setting

Whispering Pines Animal Sanctuary was nestled in a valley carved out of the Appalachian foothills of North Carolina. It wasn't exactly a tourist destination, more a haven for unwanted, injured, or otherwise displaced animals. Spanning fifty acres, the sanctuary boasted a patchwork of habitats – from spacious, fenced enclosures for the deer and rescued farm animals, to custom-built habitats for reptiles and birds. There was a dedicated veterinary clinic, a quarantine building humming with the low thrum of incubators, and a sprawling herb garden tended by a volunteer named Maggie who claimed she could cure anything with the right blend of leaves and roots. A meandering creek, fed by a natural spring, bisected the property, providing a constant source of fresh water. The entire sanctuary was shrouded in a sense of wildness, a feeling that you were on the very edge of civilization, a place where the natural world held sway. It was a haven, a refuge, a place Wilfred Theodore Finchley was proud to call his workplace, and sometimes, even his home.
