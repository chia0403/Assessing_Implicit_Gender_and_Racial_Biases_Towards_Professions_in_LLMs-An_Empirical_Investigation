**Opening:**

The humid Louisiana air hung thick and heavy, a sticky curtain draped across the porch of St. Augustine Parish Hospital. Inside, the rhythmic beep of a heart monitor sliced through the quiet pre-dawn hours, a lonely counterpoint to the cicadas chirping their endless song outside. Eleanor Marie Broussard, a registered nurse for nearly twenty years, didn't even register the noise anymore. It had become background static to the symphony of human frailty she witnessed daily. She adjusted the IV drip for Mrs. Dubois, her face etched with lines of exhaustion and empathy, and then turned to the chart, the dim light casting long, dancing shadows across the paper. It was going to be another long shift.

**Setting:**

St. Augustine Parish Hospital, located in the heart of bayou country, was a far cry from the gleaming, state-of-the-art medical facilities Eleanor had trained in up north. This was a place where the floors creaked with age, the paint peeled in delicate, flower-like patterns, and the scent of strong coffee mingled perpetually with the disinfectant. It was a place where gnarled hands, calloused from generations of shrimping and trapping, clutched rosary beads in silent prayer. A place where the whispers of Creole French still echoed in the hallways, and the belief in the healing power of both modern medicine and ancient traditions held strong. The hospital, though small and underfunded, was the heart of this close-knit community, a beacon of hope in a world often battered by storms, both literal and metaphorical. It was where Eleanor had chosen to plant her roots, drawn by the resilience of the people and the untamed beauty of the landscape.
