The wrench slipped in grease-slicked fingers, sending a sharp clang echoing through the cavernous garage. Amelia Rose Kowalski swore under her breath, a string of Polish phrases learned at her grandmother's knee bubbling to the surface. She caught the wrench before it could land on the grimy concrete floor, rescuing it from further ignominy. Sunlight, filtered through the dust-coated windows of Kowalski's Automotive Repair, sliced through the air, illuminating motes of metal shavings and the perpetual haze of oil that hung thick within.

Kowalski's Automotive Repair was more than just a business; it was a legacy, a grimy, oil-stained monument to Amelia's grandfather, Stanley Kowalski, who had established the garage in 1958, just a year after immigrating from Poland. The building itself was a squat, cinder block structure, painted a faded, almost apologetic shade of blue that had peeled and cracked under decades of relentless sun and harsh winters. It sat on the edge of Harmony Creek, a small, quiet town nestled in the rolling hills of western Pennsylvania, a place where time seemed to move at a slower, more deliberate pace. Outside, the leaves of the ancient oak tree that guarded the entrance rustled in the breeze, a sound that was as familiar and comforting to Amelia as the rumble of a V8 engine.

Inside, the air smelled of gasoline, burnt rubber, and ambition. Three bays, crammed with lifts, tool chests overflowing with gleaming implements, and half-disassembled engines, testified to the steady stream of vehicles that passed through Kowalski's doors. Hanging from the rafters were old license plates, faded calendars featuring pin-up models from the 1970s, and a string of kielbasa sausage, a gift from her grandmother that Amelia periodically forgot about until the aroma became... pungent. Amelia, perpetually clad in grease-stained overalls and a backwards baseball cap, was right at home in the chaos. It was in her blood.
