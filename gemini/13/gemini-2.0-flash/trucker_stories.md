Okay, here's a story opening with a trucker as the main character:

**Story Opening:**

The caffeine was barely cutting it. Earl Franklin “Frank” McKinley squinted at the endless black ribbon of I-40 stretching before him, the rhythmic thump of his eighteen wheels a lullaby against the hum of the engine. The dashboard clock glowed a sickly green 3:17 AM. Another three hours to Oklahoma City, another load of frozen chicken, another night fighting the sandman. He pinched the bridge of his nose, the ghost of a headache throbbing behind his eyes. This run, he’d vowed, was going to be his last for a while. He needed a break. Needed to see something other than asphalt and truck stops.

He flicked on the CB radio, hoping for some chatter, anything to break the monotony. Static crackled and hissed, then a faint voice, barely audible over the wind and road noise, cut through. "...mayday...mayday...down...mile marker 214...need..." The signal broke up entirely, swallowed by the static once more. Frank’s hand tightened on the steering wheel. Mile marker 214 was just up ahead. And that sounded like a serious situation. Forget tired, forget the ticking clock. Someone needed help.

**Setting:**

The story opens on a dark, pre-dawn stretch of Interstate 40 in western Texas. The landscape is flat and desolate, punctuated by the occasional flickering light of a distant oil rig or a lonely, wind-battered billboard. The air is cool and dry, with a hint of the desert's chill. Frank is driving a long-haul semi-truck, hauling frozen chicken from a processing plant in Amarillo, Texas, to a distribution center in Oklahoma City. The interior of the cab is cluttered but functional: maps strewn across the passenger seat, a worn-out thermos of coffee rattling in the cup holder, and dog-eared paperback novels tucked into the overhead compartment. The scene is dominated by the muted glow of the dashboard lights and the harsh glare of the truck's headlights cutting through the darkness.
