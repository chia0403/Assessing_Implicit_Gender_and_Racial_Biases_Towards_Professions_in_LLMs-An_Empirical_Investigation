**Setting:** The dust motes danced in the afternoon sun, illuminating the sheer opulence of the Grand Ballroom at Ravenwood Manor. Gilt-edged mirrors, each reflecting the scene ad infinitum, stretched across the ornate walls, their surfaces meticulously polished to a blinding sheen. Crystal chandeliers, each one a miniature galaxy, hung heavy with the weight of their shimmering pendants. The air, usually alive with the murmur of parties and the clink of champagne glasses, was heavy with the scent of beeswax and the ghost of expensive perfume. Today, the Ballroom was silent, awaiting the arrival of the week’s guest list – a coterie of wealthy socialites, eccentric artists, and ambitious politicians eager to bask in the reflected glory of the Ravenwood name.

Genevieve "Ginny" Eleanor Harding sighed, the sound barely audible over the gentle whir of the industrial vacuum cleaner. Its metallic belly grumbled as she guided it across the expanse of the pristine marble floor, a painstaking task she’d performed countless times. Ravenwood Manor demanded perfection, and perfection was what she delivered, one square inch at a time. Her eyes, the same quiet grey as the stormy Cornish sea she remembered from childhood, scanned the room for imperfections. A stray feather from a forgotten boa? A smudge on a window pane? A rogue cobweb clinging to the corner of a portrait of Lord Ravenwood’s notoriously stern ancestor? Nothing escaped Ginny’s notice. She considered herself a guardian of the manor, a silent witness to its dramas and its secrets, a role she took with quiet pride. But today, something felt different. The air held a strange tension, a prickling unease that had settled in her stomach like a cold stone. It wasn’t the usual pre-party jitters; it was something deeper, something…wrong.
