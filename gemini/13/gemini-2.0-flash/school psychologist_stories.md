## Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights of Crestwood Elementary hummed a monotonous lullaby, a sound Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth had grown immune to after five years of navigating its brightly painted, often chaotic, hallways. Today, however, even the hum felt grating, amplified by the pounding in her temples. It was the end of October, which meant parent-teacher conferences, a gauntlet of furrowed brows, whispered anxieties, and carefully curated platitudes about "unrealized potential." Eleanor pinched the bridge of her nose, her gaze fixed on the overflowing in-tray on her desk. Another request for a gifted and talented assessment. Another note from Mrs. Henderson about little Timmy's persistent refusal to share the crayons. Another child struggling, and Eleanor, armed with her psychology degree and a bottomless supply of patience, was expected to magically fix it.

## Setting:

Eleanor's office, a small, rectangular room carved out of what was probably once a storage closet, was meant to be a haven. She'd attempted to inject some warmth into the sterile space with a plush, teal rug, a calming watercolor print of a serene beach, and a collection of whimsical stress balls shaped like animals. A bookshelf held textbooks alongside well-worn copies of "Where the Wild Things Are" and "The Giving Tree." Despite her efforts, the room still felt inherently clinical, its purpose betrayed by the stark white walls and the faint scent of antiseptic wafting in from the nearby nurse's office. A small, child-sized table and two chairs sat in one corner, waiting for the next hesitant child to unburden their anxieties. Outside, the cacophony of the school day – the shriek of the playground whistle, the booming voice of the P.A. system, the rhythmic thud of basketballs in the gym – served as a constant reminder that Eleanor was just one small cog in a very large, and very loud, machine.
