**Story Opening:**

The first crack of dawn was just painting the horizon a bruised purple when Walter "Walt" Bartholomew climbed into the cab of his Komatsu PC490LC-11 excavator. The machine hummed to life beneath him, a deep, reassuring rumble that vibrated through his boots and up his spine. Walt adjusted his worn leather gloves, the scent of diesel and dirt already clinging to them, a familiar comfort. He glanced at the thermos of lukewarm coffee on the passenger seat, a silent promise of fleeting warmth against the chill of the pre-dawn air. Another day, another mountain to move. This time, quite literally.

**Setting:**

The story takes place in the heart of the Appalachian Mountains, specifically in a small, unincorporated community called Hollow Creek, nestled deep within a heavily wooded valley. The landscape is rugged and unforgiving, characterized by steep, densely forested slopes, fast-flowing creeks, and unforgiving shale rock. Hollow Creek itself is a struggling town, its economy once reliant on coal mining, now slowly dying with the seams played out. Most of the buildings are dilapidated, painted in faded shades of green and brown, remnants of a time when the town was bustling. The general store, its porch sagging under the weight of years, is the only real hub of activity, a place where the few remaining locals gather to exchange gossip and share a cup of coffee.

Walt's worksite is on the outskirts of Hollow Creek, carved into the side of one of the mountains. He's part of a team hired by a logging company to clear a large swathe of land for timber harvesting. The site is a chaotic mix of mud, fallen trees, and exposed rock, dotted with the hulking shapes of heavy machinery. The air is thick with the smell of pine needles, freshly cut wood, and the ever-present scent of diesel. The only sounds are the screech of saws, the roar of engines, and the constant, rhythmic crashing of trees being felled. The valley, once a pristine wilderness, is slowly being reshaped, acre by acre, by the relentless force of human industry.
