The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the ledger spread before Eliza Maeve Thorne. A plume of her own breath mingled with the dust motes swirling in the frigid air of the abandoned railway depot. This wasn’t exactly a bookkeeper’s usual haunt, but then again, Eliza wasn’t exactly a usual bookkeeper. She preferred the rhythmic clatter of her adding machine echoing through these cavernous, forgotten spaces to the stifling atmosphere of a stuffy office.

Tonight, the depot was particularly desolate. Rain lashed against the boarded-up windows, and the wind howled like a banshee through the broken panes, a mournful soundtrack to her calculations. Eliza, huddled deep within her wool coat, barely noticed. Her brow was furrowed in concentration as she scrutinized the figures, each number a tiny piece of a puzzle she was determined to solve. The ledger, bound in cracked leather and smelling faintly of damp earth, held the accounts of “The Nightingale’s Roost,” a speakeasy that had mysteriously vanished from the city map sometime in the late 1920s. Eliza, a self-professed history buff and a meticulous bookkeeper, had found it irresistible. She had a knack for finding discrepancies where others saw only balance, and something about these forgotten accounts screamed of secrets buried deeper than just bad business.
