## Story Opening:

The flickering fluorescent light above Amelia Eleanor Hawthorne’s drafting table hummed a low, insistent tune, a soundtrack to the quiet desperation of 4:58 PM on a Friday. Amelia, however, didn't notice it. She was lost in the dense forest of lines she’d conjured on the vellum, a meticulously rendered architectural detail of a particularly pretentious eyebrow dormer that she suspected would never actually see the light of day. Her pencil, worn smooth from years of use, danced across the paper, adding a final, precise shadow to a minuscule bracket.

She straightened, her lower back protesting with a dull ache. The familiar discomfort was welcome; it meant the end was near. Just two more minutes, then freedom. Freedom from the tyranny of CAD files, the soul-crushing monotony of rendering roof pitches, and the endless stream of lukewarm coffee that perpetually threatened to stain her pristine drafting smock.

Suddenly, the air vibrated. Not with the hum of the lights, but with something deeper, something... wrong.

## Setting:

Amelia's office, a small cubicle carved out of the larger, more prestigious space of "Architectural Visions Inc.," occupied a less-than-desirable corner on the fourth floor. Its primary view consisted of a brick wall and the fire escape ladder that clung to it. The walls of the cubicle were a faded, institutional beige, adorned with a single, dog-eared calendar featuring pictures of Victorian houses, a ironic reminder of the actual, modernist monstrosities Amelia usually ended up drafting.

The space was cramped but meticulously organized. A corkboard held a collection of meticulously sharpened pencils, categorized by hardness and length. Rolled-up blueprints were stacked neatly in a corner, secured with rubber bands. Her drafting table, the only truly significant piece of furniture, dominated the space. It was a relic from another era, a sturdy oak beast scarred with years of use and covered in a thin layer of graphite dust. Next to it sat a battered metal filing cabinet, its drawers overflowing with blueprints, specifications, and half-finished projects that were either long abandoned or eternally “in revision.” The air always smelled faintly of pencil shavings and something indefinably industrial. It was a place of quiet focus, a sanctuary where Amelia could lose herself in the geometry of the built world, or, as was increasingly the case, a prison of precise lines and unfulfilled ambition.
