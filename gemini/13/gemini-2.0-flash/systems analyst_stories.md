The fluorescent lights of the Department of Motor Vehicles hummed a monotonous dirge, a soundtrack to the purgatory that was Tuesday afternoon. Outside, the Seattle drizzle pattered against the grimy windows, blurring the city skyline into a watercolor wash of gray. Inside, the air hung thick with the stale scent of desperation and floor cleaner. Eleanor Patricia Finch, Systems Analyst, resisted the urge to sigh. Again.

Eleanor hated the DMV. Not just for the soul-crushing inefficiency and the screaming children, but because it was a microcosm of everything that was wrong with legacy systems â€“ antiquated, patched together, and held together by duct tape and sheer force of will. And as the new Systems Analyst assigned to *this* particular branch, it was Eleanor's unfortunate mission to drag it kicking and screaming into the 21st century.

She tapped her pen against the worn plastic of her clipboard, a rhythm as impatient as the tapping of the stiletto-heeled woman ahead of her in line, who was currently berating a weary-looking clerk about a misspelled "u" in her address. Eleanor, however, wasn't here to renew her license. She was here to observe. To analyze. To diagnose the digital plague that afflicted this particular circle of bureaucratic hell.
