The setting was Capri in late September, the kind of day where the Tyrrhenian Sea shimmered with an almost aggressive turquoise and the bougainvillea dripped crimson and purple down whitewashed walls. The air held a humid, floral perfume that mingled with the salty tang from the water, creating a heady, intoxicating mix. Tourists, their faces flushed with sun and spritz, milled around the Piazzetta, a cacophony of Italian, German, and the unmistakable twang of American English filling the air.

Amidst this organized chaos, standing near the iconic clock tower, holding aloft a small, tattered Italian flag on a bamboo pole, was Eleanor Rosalind Beaumont, a woman who knew Capri like the back of her hand, probably better than she knew her own address. Ellie, as she preferred to be called, was dressed in her usual uniform: sensible walking shoes, khaki trousers, and a lightweight, pale blue shirt, chosen as much for its breathability as its professionalism. She’d spent the last five years navigating the island's winding roads, ancient ruins, and hidden grottoes, sharing its secrets with anyone who would listen. And today, judging by the hopeful, if somewhat overwhelmed, expressions on the faces gathered around her, she had a captivated audience…at least for the next four hours.
