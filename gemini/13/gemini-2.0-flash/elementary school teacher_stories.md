**Story Opening:**

The scent of stale peanut butter and disinfectant clung to the air, a familiar aroma that both comforted and slightly nauseated Eleanor Amelia Finch. She sighed, adjusting the small, felt letter “F” above her desk, a wobbly testament to the creative (or perhaps destructive) talents of a group of particularly enthusiastic first graders. It was 5:17 PM, well past dismissal, and the only sounds were the rhythmic hum of the fluorescent lights and the faint drumming of rain against the windowpane. Empty juice boxes, discarded worksheets covered in glitter glue, and tiny, brightly colored plastic building blocks littered the floor, a miniature disaster area reflecting the chaos swirling inside Eleanor’s own mind.

**Setting:**

Eleanor Amelia Finch’s classroom, Room 2B, in Maplewood Elementary School. Maplewood itself was a small, unassuming town nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. The school, built in the 1950s, was a squat, brick building, weathered but solid. Room 2B was painted a pale, institutional green, attempting to be calming but ultimately failing to camouflage the cracks in the plaster. Large windows overlooked a sprawling playground, currently drenched in a late autumn downpour. Inside, the room was crammed with child-sized furniture: desks arranged in small groups, a reading corner with a threadbare rug and a collection of well-loved picture books, and a whiteboard perpetually adorned with student artwork and inspirational (and often grammatically questionable) quotes. Despite its imperfections, the room held a certain warmth, a testament to the countless hours Eleanor had spent transforming it into a welcoming space for her students. It was, in many ways, her second home.
