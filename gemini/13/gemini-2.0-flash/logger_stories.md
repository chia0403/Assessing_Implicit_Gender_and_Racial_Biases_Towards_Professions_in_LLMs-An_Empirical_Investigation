## Story Opening:

The biting wind howled through the gaps in Jedediah "Jed" Blackwood's flannel shirt, a lonely symphony echoing the emptiness that had settled in his bones. He spat a stream of tobacco juice into the snow, watching it stain the pristine white a muddy brown. Another day, another felled giant. Another victory in a war he wasn't sure he even believed in anymore. The scent of fresh-cut pine, usually a comforting aroma, clung to him now like a shroud, a constant reminder of the life he'd known, the life he was losing. Jed sighed, the sound swallowed by the relentless wind. He checked the chaps protecting his legs, adjusted his steel-toed boots, and grabbed his axe, its familiar weight a small comfort in a world that felt increasingly fragile. He had a tree to bring down, a debt to pay, and a whole lot of damn cold to ignore.

## Setting:

The story opens in the vast, snow-covered forests of the Cascade Mountains in Washington State, late January. The year is 1958. Towering Douglas firs and western hemlocks, some centuries old, dominate the landscape. Patches of deep snow cover the ground, making each step a labor. The air is crisp and biting, carrying the scent of pine and damp earth. The sky is a steel grey, promising more snow. A logging camp, a cluster of rough-hewn cabins and a central mess hall, huddles at the edge of the forest, a small pocket of human activity in an otherwise untouched wilderness. The camp is spartan and utilitarian, built for function rather than comfort, a temporary home for the men who carve their living from the trees. The silence is broken only by the wind, the distant rumble of machinery, and the occasional cry of a raven. The isolation is palpable, pressing in on the men who live and work here, a constant reminder of their vulnerability in the face of nature's immense power.
