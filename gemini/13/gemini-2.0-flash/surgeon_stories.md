The biting wind howled a mournful ballad against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, a sound that mirrored the anxiety churning in Dr. Eleanor Victoria Hayes' stomach. Situated precariously on the precipice of a windswept cliff overlooking the turbulent North Sea, the “Haven of Hope” clinic was less a haven and more a last resort for the fishermen and their families scattered across the remote Isle of Scarra. The landscape was stark, beautiful in its unforgiving nature: craggy cliffs, heather-covered moorland, and the ever-present, grey-green sea. A lone, skeletal tree clawed at the sky outside Eleanor’s window, its branches contorted by the relentless gale. Inside, the clinic was spartan but clean, smelling faintly of antiseptic and the lingering tang of the salt spray that coated everything. Tonight, however, the usual scent was overpowered by the acrid sting of ozone – the unmistakable prelude to a storm that threatened to isolate them all. Eleanor, a woman usually as calm and composed as the polished steel of her surgical instruments, felt a primal fear prickle at the back of her neck. The radio crackled with a weather warning – Force 9 gales predicted within the hour – and with it, the knowledge that the medevac helicopter wouldn’t be able to land. The news tightened her already constricted chest. Not tonight. Not with him on the operating table.
