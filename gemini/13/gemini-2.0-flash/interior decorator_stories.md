The antique brass door knocker, shaped like a snarling gargoyle, felt cold and heavy in Eloise Amelia Fairchild's hand. Rain lashed against the brim of her favourite tweed hat, threatening to soak through its jaunty feather trim. She wasn’t particularly superstitious, but something about this gothic monstrosity of a house sent a shiver down her spine that had nothing to do with the November chill.

Eloise Amelia Fairchild, interior decorator extraordinaire (at least in her own estimation and the brochures she'd painstakingly designed), was standing on the doorstep of Blackwood Manor, a sprawling edifice of grey stone and shadowed windows that loomed against the stormy Berkshire sky. The house, visible only in glimpses through the skeletal branches of ancient oaks, seemed to exhale an air of forgotten grandeur and lingering melancholy. The sprawling grounds were overgrown, a wild tapestry of tangled ivy, gnarled rose bushes, and moss-covered statues, whispering tales of neglect and secrets best left undisturbed. A rusty wrought-iron gate, perpetually creaking in the wind, guarded the property's entrance like a sentinel warning away any unwelcome intrusion.

Eloise had taken the Blackwood commission despite the whispers, the hushed tones and knowing glances she'd received in the village when mentioning the name. The previous decorator, a flamboyant young man named Jasper, had mysteriously vanished just weeks into the project. "Bad luck, that place," the baker had warned, handing over a sourdough loaf, "bad luck clings to it like cobwebs." Eloise, however, thrived on a challenge. And besides, the money was too good to pass up.

With a deep breath and a determined set to her jaw, Eloise Amelia Fairchild released the gargoyle’s head and listened as its mournful clang echoed through the foreboding silence. Blackwood Manor was waiting.
