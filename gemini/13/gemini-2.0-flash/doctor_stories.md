The biting wind clawed at Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth’s face as she hurried across the snow-covered courtyard. It was a late January afternoon in the fictional, isolated town of Oakhaven, nestled deep within the Adirondack Mountains. Oakhaven, population 842 if you counted the stray dogs and the perpetually grumpy groundskeeper, Mr. Finch, was the kind of place time forgot. Or perhaps, more accurately, the kind of place that actively tried to forget time, preferring the predictable rhythm of wood-burning stoves, gossip at the general store, and the comforting silence of the surrounding wilderness.

The Oakhaven Medical Clinic, a squat, unassuming building with peeling paint and a perpetually crooked 'Open' sign, stood as a beacon of sorts, not just of medical care but of connection to the outside world. Eleanor, bundled in her warmest parka, gloves, and a ridiculous, hand-knitted hat she’d inherited from her grandmother, fumbled with the keys to the clinic. Inside, the aroma of antiseptic mingled with the lingering scent of Mrs. Henderson's rhubarb pie, delivered that morning as a thank you for Eleanor’s successful treatment of her persistent cough. The light was on, casting a warm, yellow glow onto the snow-dusted windows. Tonight, Eleanor wasn't just a doctor; she was a lifeline. And tonight, that lifeline was about to be tested in a way she never expected.
