The rhythmic clack of keys was the only sound breaking the oppressive silence in the outer office of G&B Investments. Not the kind of silence that implied diligent focus, but the kind that screamed of a building-wide power outage and the inevitable collective grumbling to come. Beatrice Eleanor Ainsworth, however, found a strange sort of peace in it.

Beatrice, normally hunched diligently over a mountain of paperwork, was now leaning back in her ergonomically inadequate chair, her fingers interlaced behind her head, a small, almost mischievous smile playing on her lips. The power outage had been announced twenty minutes ago, plunging the sleek, modern office building, all glass and steel, into a disconcerting twilight. Beatrice, the unflappable secretary to Mr. Bartholomew Granville, the firmâ€™s notoriously demanding CEO, had dutifully informed her boss, offered him a cup of tepid, now-definitively-cold coffee, and then calmly declared her right to a well-deserved break.

G&B Investments, a titan in the world of hedge funds and high-stakes investments, occupied the top three floors of the Pinnacle Tower, a gleaming skyscraper overlooking the Hudson River in lower Manhattan. The view, usually a source of bustling energy and inspiring ambition, was now obscured by a hazy, pre-storm grey sky. The polished chrome and mahogany furniture, typically radiating power and affluence, looked oddly vulnerable in the dim light, like stage props stripped of their dazzling performance. The air, usually thick with the scent of expensive cologne and ambition, was still and heavy, pregnant with anticipation of a potential downpour. For once, Beatrice Eleanor Ainsworth felt like she had the upper hand in a game she hadn't even realised she was playing. And she was enjoying every minute of it.
