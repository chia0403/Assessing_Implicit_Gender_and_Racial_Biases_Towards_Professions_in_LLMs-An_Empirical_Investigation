The stale air in the Carver County Courthouse hung heavy with the scent of desperation, a scent that Imogen Alistair Radcliffe had become intimately familiar with over the past fifteen years. Sunlight, weak and filtered through the grime-streaked windows, barely managed to penetrate the gloom that clung to the corners of the antiquated building. A chipped, oak lectern stood sentinel in the center of the courtroom, worn smooth by countless oaths and accusations. Imogen tugged at the collar of her crisp, blue blazer, the fabric suddenly feeling suffocating. This wasn’t her arena; she was a corporate lawyer, usually battling over mergers and acquisitions in gleaming, glass-walled offices, not defending petty thieves in a decaying county courthouse on the outskirts of Minneapolis.

Her case was scheduled to be called any minute now, and the relentless tick-tock of the antique clock on the back wall felt like a metronome counting down to her impending doom. She adjusted the stack of dog-eared files clutched in her sweaty palm. This wasn’t a case she’d volunteered for; it had been assigned to her pro bono by her firm, a not-so-subtle reminder that prestige came with certain…obligations. But more than the unwelcome assignment, it was the abject hopelessness radiating from her client, a young man accused of stealing a loaf of bread, that gnawed at Imogen's resolve. She had to do something. She *would* do something. Even if it meant battling the cynicism that had slowly begun to corrode her idealism, one million-dollar deal at a time.
