The wind, a gnawing beast from the north, clawed at Aella Maris's exposed skin as she chipped away at the stubborn granite. The rhythmic *thwack* of her hammer against the chisel was a familiar lullaby, a counterpoint to the howling wind and the constant crash of waves against the jagged cliffs below. The setting was Dunmar, a village clinging precariously to the edge of the Isle of Skye. Homes, weathered grey stone themselves, huddled together for warmth, their roofs weighted down against the gales. Aella’s workshop, little more than a lean-to built against the largest boulder in the village square, was open to the elements, offering a breathtaking, albeit brutal, view of the churning Atlantic. Dust, a perpetual companion, coated her worn leather apron and dusted her thick, dark braid, escaping the confines of her woolen cap. The raw, unforgiving beauty of Skye fueled Aella’s work, transforming the cold, unyielding stone into objects of art and utility, each piece a testament to the island's enduring strength and Aella’s own quiet determination. Today, however, the wind seemed to carry a particular urgency, a whisper of something unsettling on the horizon.
