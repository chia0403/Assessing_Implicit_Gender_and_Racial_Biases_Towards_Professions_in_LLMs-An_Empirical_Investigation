The fluorescent lights of Northwood High buzzed a monotonous symphony of discontent, a soundtrack Beatrice Eleanor Montgomery knew all too well. Dust motes danced in the air, illuminated by the weak November sun that struggled to pierce the grimy windows of her office. Beatrice sighed, the sound a weary puff that condensed briefly in the chilled air of the room. The radiator, a relic from the building's glory days (glory days that, from what she'd gathered, never actually existed), stubbornly refused to relinquish its grip on the icy tendrils that clung to it.

Beatrice, guidance counselor extraordinaire and designated emotional dumping ground for generations of angst-ridden teenagers, adjusted her floral-print scarf – a valiant attempt to inject some cheer into the institutional beige – and glanced at the ticking clock. 3:48 PM. Just enough time for one more emergency before she could escape to the blessed silence of her apartment.

Outside, the hallway echoed with the slamming of lockers and the shrieks of students released from the day's academic constraints. The air was thick with the combined aromas of stale pizza, industrial cleaner, and desperation. Northwood High, nestled in the forgotten corner of the rust belt city of Mill Creek, was a place where dreams came to be deferred, often indefinitely. And Beatrice Eleanor Montgomery was there to gently, or sometimes not-so-gently, remind them of that reality.
