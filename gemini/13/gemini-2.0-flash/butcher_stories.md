## Story Opening:

The first tendrils of dawn, a watery grey, were just beginning to seep into the narrow alley behind "The Crown & Cleaver" when Alistair "Al" Bartholomew, butcher extraordinaire and chronic grumbler, slammed the heavy oak door shut against the chill. He pulled his thick, blood-stained apron tighter around him, the scent of sawdust, sawdust, and iron lingering in the air. Alistair sighed, the sound a puff of condensation in the frigid air, and squinted at the sky. He knew, with a certainty that only decades of waking before the sun could bring, that it was going to be a bone-chillingly slow day. 

## Setting:

The Crown & Cleaver, Alistairâ€™s butcher shop, was tucked away on a cobbled street in the old market district of Grimshaw, a town renowned for its perpetual drizzle and stubbornly traditional inhabitants. The shop itself was a study in controlled chaos. A single, frosted window showcased neatly arranged rows of sausages, plump chickens, and perfectly marbled cuts of beef, all illuminated by a flickering gas lamp. Inside, the air hung thick with the savory aroma of smoked meats and the metallic tang of fresh blood. Gleaming hooks dangled from the low, beamed ceiling, ready to bear the weight of whatever unfortunate animal Alistair deemed worthy of his cleaver. Sawdust carpeted the floor, absorbing the daily deluge of drippings. Behind the counter, a scarred butcher's block, stained crimson with years of service, stood as Alistair's dominion. Above it hung a collection of gleaming knives, each honed to a razor's edge and each with a specific purpose, a silent testament to Alistair's meticulous craft. Grimshaw, despite its unchanging nature, held secrets beneath its cobbled streets and behind its curtained windows, secrets that Alistair, despite his best efforts, was about to stumble headfirst into.
