Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a highway worker named Elara Juniper Rodriguez:

**Story Opening & Setting:**

The pre-dawn air bit at Elara Juniper Rodriguez’s exposed cheeks, a stinging greeting she'd grown accustomed to after five years of patching asphalt before the sun even considered showing its face. She tugged her thick, neon-orange beanie further down, trying to trap a little warmth, and exhaled a plume of white that danced briefly in the half-light filtering through the towering pines. Highway 17 snaked ahead, a dark ribbon draped across the shoulders of the Cascade Mountains, still draped in shadow.

Elara leaned against the cold, steel bed of her Caltrans truck, the familiar scent of diesel and hot tar thick in her nostrils. In the distance, the faint rumble of an engine grew steadily louder, a lonely sound echoing through the otherwise silent wilderness. This stretch of 17, between the tiny towns of Skykomish and Stevens Pass, was Elara's kingdom – a kingdom of potholes, rock slides, and the occasional bewildered bear. She knew every curve, every bump, every crevice of the aging highway. And, as she listened to the approaching vehicle, she felt a primal unease ripple through her. It wasn't the sound of a logging truck or a delivery van, the usual early risers. This was something…different. Something heavier, and far too fast.

**Setting Details:**

*   **Location:** Highway 17, a mountainous stretch between Skykomish and Stevens Pass in the Cascade Mountains, Washington State.
*   **Time:** Pre-dawn, around 5:00 AM.
*   **Environment:** Dense evergreen forests, rugged terrain, winding road. Weather is cold, likely with frost or even light snow depending on the season (best suited to late fall/early winter).
*   **Atmosphere:** Isolated, rugged, slightly foreboding due to the wilderness and the time of day. A sense of routine mixed with the potential for unexpected danger.

I hope this works as a launching point for your story! Good luck!
