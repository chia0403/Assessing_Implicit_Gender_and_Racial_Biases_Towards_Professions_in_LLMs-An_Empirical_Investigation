Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a bellhop named Charles Frederick Butterfield:

**Story Opening:**

The revolving door of the Grand Majestic Hotel spun with a sigh, ejecting a cloud of expensive perfume and a frazzled woman clutching a chihuahua dressed in a tiny argyle sweater. Charles Frederick Butterfield, a man whose perfectly-pressed uniform hid a soul weary beyond his twenty-three years, plastered on his most charming bellhop smile. "Welcome to the Grand Majestic, madam! May I assist you with your luggage?" He already knew the answer; it was always yes.

The chihuahua yapped, the woman cooed, and Charles braced himself. This was the morning shift, and at the Grand Majestic, the morning shift was alwaysâ€¦ an event.

**Setting:**

The Grand Majestic Hotel occupies an entire city block in the heart of Chicago's Magnificent Mile. It's a monument to Gilded Age excess, with a gleaming white facade, intricate wrought-iron balconies overlooking Michigan Avenue, and a lobby that could house a small village.

Inside, crystal chandeliers the size of Volkswagens hang from a sky-high ceiling, reflecting light onto marble floors polished to a blinding sheen. Plush velvet seating in jewel tones is strategically placed for discreet conversations and lavish people-watching. The air hums with a subtle, almost imperceptible melody composed of hushed chatter, the gentle clinking of champagne flutes from the adjacent bar, and the faint, almost regal whoosh of the central air conditioning.

Behind the grand reception desk, impeccably groomed staff members manage a constant flow of dignitaries, celebrities, and the merely ridiculously wealthy. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingled with the faint scent of lilies and old money permeates every corner, creating an atmosphere of opulence and almost suffocating expectation. This is not just a hotel; it's a carefully curated experience, designed to make its guests feel as though they've stepped into a world where every whim is catered to and every problem disappears with a discreetly slipped fifty. And Charles Frederick Butterfield is right there, in the thick of it, carrying the bags and the burdens of a life far removed from his own.
