The sterile white walls of the "Embrace Wellness Clinic" hummed with the low thrum of the air conditioning, a constant, almost oppressive buzz that did little to soothe the anxieties swirling in Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne's stomach. Outside, the unforgiving Florida sun beat down on the meticulously manicured lawns, but in here, trapped in her small, sparsely decorated office, Amelia felt a different kind of heat building â€“ a simmering frustration with the same tired narrative she heard every single day.

Amelia, a registered dietitian with a master's in nutritional science and a perpetually optimistic outlook (at least, until recently), had always believed in the power of food to heal. She envisioned herself empowering people, guiding them toward vibrant health and sustainable lifestyle changes. Instead, she mostly found herself counseling patients who expected a magic pill, a quick fix to undo years of processed foods and sedentary habits.

Today's appointment was Mrs. Eleanor Higgins, a notoriously difficult client who'd already sent three emails complaining about the blandness of her pre-approved meal plan. Amelia sighed, adjusted the crisp white collar of her blouse, and prepared to put on her most encouraging smile. She just hoped she could muster enough genuine enthusiasm to make it through another hour of lecturing a woman who, in Amelia's increasingly weary opinion, didn't actually want to be helped. The clock on the wall clicked with agonizing slowness, each tick amplifying the tension in the room. It was 1:58 PM. Two more minutes until Eleanor Higgins arrived, and Amelia felt like she was about to face a firing squad armed with sugar-laden donuts.
