Okay, here's a story opening and setting for a story featuring a receptionist:

**Setting:** The lobby of "Synergy Solutions," a mid-sized marketing firm in downtown Portland, Oregon. The lobby is a study in modern corporate blandness: brushed steel accents, a reception desk made of imitation marble, and abstract art that probably cost more than Felicity's entire car. A ficus tree, predictably struggling for survival in the low light, stands sentinel near the elevators. It's a Tuesday morning, around 9:15 am, and the air hums with the subdued, almost menacing, energy of a company about to hit its stride.

**Opening:**

"Another one for Mr. Thompson," Felicity Anne Plum muttered under her breath, slapping a bright pink "RETURN TO SENDER" sticker on yet another oversized package addressed to the notoriously difficult head of Creative. Honestly, did people think he was *actually* going to try and wear that sequined unicorn headpiece? Felicity suspected not. It was barely 9:15, and she'd already dealt with a lost delivery driver, a disgruntled client demanding to speak to "someone in charge," and three separate requests for paperclips, which, apparently, only *she* was capable of locating in the entire building. Felicity sighed, adjusting the ill-fitting headset that perpetually slid off her auburn curls. At least the coffee was still hot. She took a long sip, bracing herself for whatever chaos the rest of the day had in store. The elevators pinged, and Felicity straightened up, pasting on her best professional smile. Time to face the music â€“ or, more accurately, the corporate elevator music, which, let's be honest, was far less appealing.
