Okay, here's a story opening and setting, featuring our phlebotomist main character:

**Story Opening:**

The sterile scent of antiseptic clung to the air, a fragrance Beatrice Eleanor Hawthorne knew better than her own perfume.  At 6:15 AM, predawn was still clinging to the Philadelphia sky, a bruised indigo visible through the frosted glass of the donor bay windows.  She tapped her pen impatiently against the clipboard, the faint click echoing in the otherwise silent room. Her first appointment of the day, Mr. Henderson, was fifteen minutes late, a breach of punctuality that bordered on sacrilege in Beatrice's world.  She hated starting her day off-kilter. More patients were trickling in now, lining up near reception. With a sigh, Beatrice set down the clipboard and began meticulously preparing her station, laying out butterfly needles, vacutainers, and tourniquets with the precision of a surgeon.  Some people found the sight of blood unnerving, a primal fear bubbling to the surface.  Beatrice found it fascinating.  Each vial, each drop, held a story, a tiny window into the intricate workings of the human body.  If only Mr. Henderson would cooperate and provide the first chapter on time.

**Setting:**

The story takes place in the main outpatient phlebotomy clinic of **"City General Hospital"** in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  The clinic itself is a relatively modern space, attempting to balance clinical efficiency with a modicum of comforting design. Think muted blues and greens, padded chairs, and abstract art on the walls â€“ attempts to distract from the inherent anxiety surrounding needles and blood draws.  There's a large, bustling reception area at the front, with several waiting chairs. Behind that is a horseshoe-shaped counter with several receptionists busily checking in patients.  Behind the reception desk, a hallway leads to a series of small, individual phlebotomy bays, each equipped with a specialized chair designed for blood draws, a rolling cart stocked with supplies, and a sink for handwashing. The atmosphere is usually a mix of hushed anticipation and quiet chatter. Outside, the city rumbles to life as the workday begins, a stark contrast to the controlled, almost meditative atmosphere of the clinic.
