The bell above the door of "Fitzwilliam's Fine Cuts" jingled a weary, familiar tune, a sound that usually sent a shiver of anticipation down Barnaby Fitzwilliam's spine. Today, however, it barely registered. He was staring, as he often did on slow Tuesdays, at the faded photograph pinned above his mirror. His grandfather, a dapper man with a handlebar mustache that could rival a walrus, beamed back at him, clutching a pair of gleaming clippers. Heâ€™d built this place, brick by painstaking brick, in 1928, during a time when a clean shave and a neatly trimmed head of hair were considered a man's civic duty. Now, in 2023, Barnaby felt more like a relic than a respected craftsman.

The setting was Oakhaven, a sleepy town nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. Once a thriving hub for coal mining, Oakhaven had withered along with the mines, leaving behind a population of aging locals and the occasional lost tourist searching for "authentic Americana." Fitzwilliam's Fine Cuts, located on Main Street, was one of the last remaining businesses that remembered Oakhaven's glory days. The shop itself was a time capsule, smelling of bay rum, leather strop, and the faint, lingering scent of his grandfather's pipe tobacco. The original barber chair, a hulking behemoth upholstered in cracked burgundy leather, held pride of place, facing a wall lined with dusty jars of hair tonic and pomade. Sunlight, strained through the lace curtains in the window, cast long, melancholic shadows across the checkerboard tile floor, making Barnaby Fitzwilliam feel more like a museum curator than a barber.
