## Story Opening:

The rhythmic *whirr* of the lumbar traction table was almost hypnotic. Dr. Evelyn Grace Holloway, D.C., leaned against the cool ceramic counter, the fluorescent lights of Holloway Chiropractic Clinic buzzing softly overhead. She watched Mr. Peterson, his wrinkled hands clasped over his bulging abdomen, being gently stretched like taffy. He'd been coming to Evelyn for years, ever since his golf swing had betrayed him and launched him into a whirlwind of sciatic pain.

Evelyn sighed, a knot forming between her shoulder blades that she knew she'd need to adjust herself later. It wasn't just the pressure of the day, the endless stream of strained backs and twisted necks. It was a feeling, a nagging sense of unease that had been clinging to her for weeks, like the damp sea air that permeated the small coastal town of Port Blossom.

The town siren wailed, a long, mournful sound that echoed through the clinic's double-paned windows. Evelyn’s hand instinctively went to the small, silver charm bracelet that adorned her wrist. Each charm represented a significant moment in her life, a physical reminder of where she'd come from and who she was. The lighthouse charm, a miniature replica of the iconic Beacon Hill Light that stood sentinel on the cliffs overlooking the town, felt strangely cold against her skin. Something was wrong in Port Blossom, and Evelyn had a feeling she was about to be caught in the undertow.

## Setting:

The story unfolds in Port Blossom, Maine, a quaint, albeit slowly decaying, coastal town clinging to the edge of the Atlantic. Once a thriving fishing port, Port Blossom now relies mostly on tourism and a dwindling lobster industry.

*   **Holloway Chiropractic Clinic:** Evelyn's practice is located in a converted Victorian house on Main Street. It boasts a waiting room filled with comfortable armchairs and nautical-themed decor, exam rooms with state-of-the-art equipment, and a small, private office cluttered with anatomy charts and research papers. The clinic is Evelyn's sanctuary, a place where she can help people find relief from pain and connect with her community.

*   **Beacon Hill Lighthouse:** A majestic, historic landmark overlooking the ocean, the lighthouse is a symbol of Port Blossom and a personal touchstone for Evelyn, whose grandfather was its last official keeper. It stands tall and proud, but its age is showing, mirroring the town's own struggle to remain relevant.

*   **The Rusty Anchor Tavern:** A local watering hole known for its salty clientele, cheap beer, and the best clam chowder in Maine. It’s a place where secrets are whispered and stories are exchanged, a place where Evelyn often finds herself seeking information and observing the pulse of the town.

*   **The surrounding coastline:** The jagged, rocky coastline, dotted with hidden coves and windswept beaches, provides a dramatic backdrop and a sense of isolation, emphasizing the town's vulnerability to the unpredictable forces of nature and perhaps, something more sinister.
