**Opening:**

The scent of rain-soaked earth clinging to her sensible, but stylish, boots was a familiar comfort. Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth always felt more grounded when the world was a little damp. Which was fortunate, considering the perpetually overcast skies of Seattle. Tonight, the rain was a downpour, drumming a frantic rhythm against the tinted glass of her office window, mimicking the anxious beat of her own heart. She’d just finished with Mr. Henderson, a man whose grief was a black hole, sucking in everything around him. He’d been a particularly heavy session, and Eleanor felt the familiar tug of vicarious trauma tightening her shoulders. As she watched the city lights blur through the rain-streaked glass, her phone vibrated on her desk, the caller ID displaying "Unknown." She usually let those go to voicemail, but something about the insistent buzz felt…different. A premonition, perhaps? Or just the weary paranoia that came with being a counseling psychologist.

**Setting:**

Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth's office, "Ainsworth Counseling," occupied the top floor of a renovated brick building in the vibrant Fremont neighborhood of Seattle. The space was carefully curated to be both professional and calming. Sunlight streamed through large windows during the day, illuminating the soft, neutral tones of the walls. A plush, oatmeal-colored rug covered the hardwood floor, muffling sounds and adding a layer of warmth. Two comfortable armchairs, upholstered in a muted teal fabric, faced each other, inviting intimate conversation. Between them, a low, circular coffee table held a carefully arranged selection of smooth river stones and a small, thriving succulent. Bookshelves lined one wall, filled with texts on psychology, philosophy, and even a few well-loved novels. A framed print of Georgia O'Keeffe's "Sky Above Clouds IV" hung above Eleanor's desk, a constant reminder of the vastness of the human experience. The overall effect was one of serene order, a sanctuary from the chaotic world outside.
