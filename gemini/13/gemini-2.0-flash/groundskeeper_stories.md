## Opening:

The morning dew clung to everything, painting the manicured lawns of Blackwood Manor with a shimmering, ephemeral beauty. For a moment, Bartholomew Reginald Finch, the groundskeeper, simply stood at the edge of the rose garden, a weathered hand resting on the cool iron of his shears, and breathed. The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and blooming tea roses, held a fragile peace that he knew wouldn't last. Not on a day like today. Today, the new owners were due to arrive, and Bartholomew had a feeling his quiet existence was about to be irrevocably disrupted.

## Setting:

Blackwood Manor was a gothic behemoth, a testament to a bygone era of wealth and eccentricity. Nestled deep in the heart of the Yorkshire Moors, it was a place of towering spires, ivy-choked walls, and shadowed secrets. For generations, the Blackwood family had ruled over the surrounding lands, their influence radiating like a dark halo. The Manor itself was a labyrinth of echoing corridors, dusty libraries filled with forgotten lore, and cavernous ballrooms that hadn't seen life in decades.

Outside, the grounds sprawled for acres, encompassing meticulously crafted gardens, a sprawling orchard heavy with ancient apple trees, a shimmering lake rumored to be bottomless, and a sprawling, untamed wood that bordered the property. Bartholomew knew every inch of this land, every root and every stone. He was its silent guardian, its confidante, its only constant amidst the shifting tides of fortune that had washed through Blackwood Manor for centuries.
