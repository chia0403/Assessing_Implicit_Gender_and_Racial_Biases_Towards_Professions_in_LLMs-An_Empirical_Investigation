## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** The biting February wind whipped across the Brooklyn Bridge, a howling, frigid symphony echoing against the steel cables. Snow, long turned to greasy slush, clung to the pedestrian walkway, making each step a potential slip into the dark, swirling waters below. The glittering Manhattan skyline, usually a beacon of aspiration, was today shrouded in a melancholic grey, mirroring the city’s mood.

**Opening:**

The scream cut through the wind like a broken siren, momentarily silencing the city's usual cacophony. Eliza Thorne, her gloved hand instinctively reaching for the recorder in her satchel, cursed under her breath. Damn it, she was already late. But a scream like that... you didn’t just ignore it.

Eliza, a hardened crime reporter for the *New York Chronicle*, pushed her way past a gaggle of startled tourists, her breath fogging the air. She scanned the walkway, her eyes, sharpened by years of chasing sirens and interviewing hardened criminals, immediately picking out the small crowd huddled near the centre of the bridge. Their faces, pale and strained, told her all she needed to know. This wasn’t just a dropped bagel or a forgotten wallet. This was something far, far worse. She quickened her pace, a grim anticipation settling in her stomach. This was the story she’d been dreading. This was the story that would haunt her.
