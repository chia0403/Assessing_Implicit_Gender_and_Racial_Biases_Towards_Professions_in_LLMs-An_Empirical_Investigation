## Story Opening:

The scent of cedar and sawdust hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to **Arthur Bartholomew Finch**. He’d inhaled this particular blend practically since birth, his lungs accustomed to its soothing, almost melancholic perfume. Today, though, the scent did little to calm the gnawing anxiety that had taken root in his stomach. He ran a calloused thumb over the smooth, unfinished edge of the mahogany coffin, a grim testament to his current occupation, and swallowed hard.

He hadn’t wanted to take the job. Arthur preferred building things with life, not preparing them for death. He excelled at crafting sturdy, welcoming porches, intricately carved headboards, and rocking chairs that sang a lullaby of comfort. But work was scarce in Havenwood these days, and Widow Mallory paid well, very well, for a job done quickly and discreetly.

**Setting:**

Havenwood, a small, isolated town nestled deep in the Appalachian Mountains, was a place where time seemed to move slower, clinging to traditions and secrets like moss on ancient stones. The buildings were mostly weathered wood, painted in muted shades of grey, brown, and faded green, as if trying to blend into the surrounding forest. A single, winding road snaked through the heart of the town, leading to the church, the general store, and ultimately, to the sprawling, dilapidated manor on the outskirts, home to Widow Mallory and, now, the scene of Arthur's uncomfortable task. The air was thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, a constant reminder of the forest’s encroaching presence, always threatening to reclaim the town entirely.
