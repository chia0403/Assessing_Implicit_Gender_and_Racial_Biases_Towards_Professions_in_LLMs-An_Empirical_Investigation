**Setting:** The humid air hung thick and heavy over the small, dilapidated baseball field. The stands were mostly empty, the weathered wooden planks groaning under the weight of the few parents who'd braved the late afternoon heat. Rust ate away at the chain-link fence surrounding the diamond, and weeds stubbornly poked through the parched dirt of the infield. This was Miller Field, home to the forgettable Willow Creek Wildcats, a team more accustomed to losing than winning.

**Story Opening:**

Sweat plastered strands of greying hair to the forehead of **Elias "Eli" Danielson**. He squinted against the harsh sunlight, the lines around his eyes deepening as he watched his team bumble through another fielding drill. The crack of the bat sounded weak and lifeless, a stark contrast to the energy Eli remembered from his own playing days. He chewed on the inside of his cheek, a nervous habit he hadn't been able to shake since taking the coaching job at Willow Creek High five years ago. Five years of near misses, of heartbreaking defeats, and of watching promising talent wilt under the pressure of expectation â€“ or, more often, the pressure of apathy. He slammed his worn clipboard against his thigh, the sound echoing in the oppressive stillness. "Alright, that's enough!" Eli's voice, usually a booming baritone, sounded strained. "Let's try and look like we actually *want* to be here, huh?" The teenage faces in the field looked back at him, a mixture of resignation and annoyance clouding their expressions. Eli sighed. This was going to be a long season.
