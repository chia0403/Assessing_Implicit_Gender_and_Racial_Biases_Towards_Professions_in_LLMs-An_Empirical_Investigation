The fluorescent lights of the abandoned wing hummed with a discordant, unsettling energy. Dust motes danced in the stale air, illuminated like tiny, rebellious stars. The scent of decay – a mixture of old paper, forgotten chemicals, and something faintly fungal – clung to everything, a persistent reminder of the decades that had passed since these rooms had last held life.

It was in this silent, echoing space that Bartholomew Abernathy shuffled along, his oversized mop bucket clanging softly against the worn linoleum. Bartholomew, a man more accustomed to the shadows than the spotlight, was the night janitor at the Blackwood Asylum, a hulking Gothic monstrosity perched on the edge of the windswept moorland. Tonight, he’d drawn the short straw – or, more accurately, the grimy, crumpled work order – assigning him to clear out the long-sealed West Wing. He clutched the handle of his mop a little tighter, the familiar grip a small comfort in the face of the growing unease that prickled his skin. He’d heard whispers about this wing, hushed tales of experiments gone wrong, of patients driven to madness within its walls. Bartholomew Abernathy preferred facts and logic, but even he couldn’t quite shake the feeling that tonight, the silence of the West Wing was hiding something. Something he wasn't sure he wanted to find.
