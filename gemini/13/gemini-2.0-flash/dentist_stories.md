## Story Opening:

The low thrum of the suction unit was a lullaby to Dr. Eleanor Vance. Not a particularly pleasant lullaby, perhaps, more like the mechanical snore of a grumpy giant, but a lullaby nonetheless. It meant she was knee-deep in a molar, shielded by her loupes from the grim reality of decay, and for the next forty minutes, the world outside her practice could simply cease to exist.

Today, that world was clamoring to get her attention. The relentless Seattle drizzle drummed against the frosted glass of her office window, a rhythm that mirrored the insistent buzzing in her pocket - a buzzing she resolutely ignored. She had Mrs. Higgins open wide and trusting (well, as trusting as one can be with a metal pick inches from their gums), and Eleanor refused to be distracted by whatever fresh chaos her life had concocted. The buzzing persisted. Eleanor sighed inwardly, tightened her grip on the explorer, and focused on tracing the outline of a stubborn piece of tartar. She'd deal with the apocalypse later. First, she had a quadrant to clean.

## Setting:

Dr. Eleanor Vance's dental practice, "Vance Family Dentistry," was located in a renovated Victorian house in the heart of Seattle's quirky Fremont neighborhood. Despite its somewhat outdated exterior, the interior was meticulously modern, a stark contrast designed to reassure patients that while the building might have seen a century or two, the equipment inside was state-of-the-art. Light poured in through the large windows, illuminating the cool, calming blues and greens of the d√©cor. The waiting room, deliberately uncluttered, featured local artwork and a fish tank populated by brightly colored Betta fish, an attempt to distract from the inherent anxiety of an upcoming dental appointment. The individual examination rooms were meticulously clean and organized, each equipped with a high-tech dental chair, digital X-ray machine, and an arsenal of tools that Dr. Vance considered her personal instruments of (gentle) healing. The faint smell of antiseptic, mingled with the subtle aroma of the freshly brewed coffee in the waiting room, created a unique, almost sterile, atmosphere - the scent of fear mitigated by the promise of a perfect, gleaming smile.
