## Opening:

The midday sun beat down on the dusty window of "Wanderlust & Wings," the hand-painted lettering peeling ever so slightly in the corner. Beatrice Eleanor Fairchild sighed, swatting at a stray fly buzzing around the miniature Eiffel Tower on her desk. Another Tuesday, another hour spent staring at spreadsheets and fielding inquiries about all-inclusive resorts in Cancun. Beatrice longed for adventure, for the scent of jasmine in a Moroccan souk, for the echoing chants of monks in a Tibetan monastery. But instead, she was here, in the suffocatingly beige confines of her agency, selling watered-down versions of the world to people who mostly wanted a guaranteed tan and an endless supply of lukewarm margaritas.

The phone buzzed, shattering her reverie. Beatrice reluctantly picked it up, plastering on her most professional (and practiced) tone. “Wanderlust & Wings, this is Beatrice speaking, how can I whisk you away today?”

## Setting:

The setting is **Stillwater, Nebraska, in the late summer.** Stillwater is a quintessential Midwestern town: wide, tree-lined streets, a historic Main Street struggling to stay afloat, and a general atmosphere of quiet contentment – the kind that can feel both comforting and stifling. "Wanderlust & Wings" is located on that very Main Street, sandwiched between a struggling antique shop and a barbershop perpetually playing sports radio.

The agency itself is small and cluttered, a testament to Beatrice's own frustrated wanderlust. Travel posters depicting exotic locales adorn every wall, competing for space with framed photographs of Beatrice's own (limited) travels: a hurried weekend trip to Chicago, a family vacation to Disney World, a blurry shot of her awkwardly posing in front of the Grand Canyon. The furniture is a mismatched collection of hand-me-downs, including a plush, oversized armchair that Beatrice salvaged from her grandmother's attic, and a desk piled high with brochures, maps, and half-empty coffee cups. The air smells faintly of dust and the artificial coconut scent of Beatrice's perpetually burning "Tropical Paradise" candle, a small act of rebellion against the monotony of her reality.
