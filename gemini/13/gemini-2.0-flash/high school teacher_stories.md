The scent of industrial-strength cleaner still clung to Mrs. Eleanor Beatrice Ainsworth like a second skin, a stark reminder of the spilled cranberry juice incident in the cafeteria just hours earlier. Eleanor sighed, running a hand through her perpetually unruly, salt-and-pepper bun. This was just another Tuesday at Northwood High, a sprawling, brick-and-mortar institution that sat nestled uncomfortably between a bustling highway and a rapidly gentrifying neighborhood in suburban Maryland.

The classroom, Room 207, was Eleanor's sanctuary – or as much of a sanctuary as a room filled with thirty-odd hormonal teenagers could be. She’d painstakingly curated its atmosphere: posters of Emily Dickinson and Maya Angelou adorned the walls alongside student-created artwork, a battered armchair sat invitingly near the bookshelf overflowing with classic and contemporary literature, and the gentle hum of a fish tank (housing a single, perpetually grumpy goldfish named Hemingway) provided a semblance of calm. 

Now, however, in the pre-dawn gloom of Wednesday morning, the room felt desolate. The chairs were stacked haphazardly on the desks, the white board was streaked with remnants of yesterday's spirited (and often off-topic) debate on the symbolism of the green light in *The Great Gatsby*, and a single, forgotten apple core sat festering on the windowsill. Eleanor shivered, pulling her well-worn cardigan tighter around herself. Today was the day. The day she had to deliver the news, the news that might just unravel the fragile world she had so carefully constructed within these four walls.
