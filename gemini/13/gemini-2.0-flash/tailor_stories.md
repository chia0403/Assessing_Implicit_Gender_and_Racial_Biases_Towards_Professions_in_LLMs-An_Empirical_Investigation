## Story Opening:

The late afternoon sun, already bruised with the hues of impending twilight, bled through the grime-coated window of Thaddeus Bartholomew Finchâ€™s workshop. Dust motes, disturbed by the trembling of his breath, danced in the amber rays, illuminating the almost skeletal lines of his face. His spectacles, perched precariously on the bridge of his nose, magnified the minute stitches he was taking on a scrap of midnight-blue velvet. He was working against the clock, a frantic race against a promise, and against the encroaching darkness that always seemed to amplify the gnawing emptiness in his stomach. The clock, a battered grandfather clock inherited from his grandfather, a grandfather he barely remembered, chimed five times, each bong resonating in the silence of the room like a mocking toll. Thaddeus sighed, a small, defeated sound that was swallowed by the thick, musty air of his little kingdom.

## Setting:

Thaddeus Bartholomew Finch's workshop was a claustrophobic space above a barely functioning butcher shop on a side street of Lower Glimmering, a perpetually damp and slightly dilapidated district in the sprawling city of Oakhaven. The air was a potent cocktail of stale meat, damp wool, and the ever-present scent of Thaddeus's ancient beeswax polish. Bolts of fabric, ranging from the finest silk to roughspun linen, lined the walls, stacked haphazardly alongside pattern books filled with faded illustrations of forgotten fashions. A well-worn cutting table dominated the center of the room, its surface scarred with countless cuts and stained with remnants of countless projects. Shelves groaned under the weight of thread spools in every imaginable color, buttons of every size and material, and an arsenal of needles, shears, and other tools that were as familiar to Thaddeus as the lines on his own hands. In one corner, nestled beneath a cobweb-draped mannequin draped in a half-finished gown, sat Thaddeus's treadle sewing machine, a relic from a bygone era, its rhythmic clatter the soundtrack to his solitary existence. The overall impression was one of organised chaos, a testament to a lifetime spent dedicated to the art of tailoring, a dedication that, Thaddeus often suspected, had been more of a curse than a calling.
