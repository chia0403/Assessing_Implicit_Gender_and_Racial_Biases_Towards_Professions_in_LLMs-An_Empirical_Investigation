## Story Opening:

The biting wind whipped across the skeletal frame of the new high-rise, snatching at the edges of Leo Maxwell’s hard hat. He braced himself against the gust, one gloved hand gripping a cold steel beam, his breath pluming in a hazy cloud. Below him, the city of Chicago sprawled, a glittering tapestry of steel and glass stretching to the icy horizon of Lake Michigan. From this height, the cars looked like toy soldiers, their horns muffled by the distance. He could almost forget, up here, about the screaming foreman, the aching muscles, the constant fear of a misstep. Almost.

But the rhythmic clang of hammers further up the steel skeleton, and the gnawing ache in his lower back, were a constant reminder of the reality: this was his life. Building empires for other people, one rivet and beam at a time.

He spit into the wind, a dark fleck swallowed by the swirling air. Another day, another dollar closer to paying off the loan on his beat-up pickup. Another day closer to…what, exactly? Leo wasn’t quite sure.

## Setting:

The story takes place in **Chicago, Illinois** during a particularly harsh winter. The primary setting is the **construction site of a brand-new skyscraper**, tentatively named "The Phoenix Tower", rising in the heart of the downtown business district. The building is still in its early stages, consisting primarily of a steel skeleton reaching high into the sky. The environment is exposed, dangerous, and constantly at the mercy of the elements. Beyond the construction site, the story may also briefly touch upon Leo's sparse apartment in a working-class neighborhood on the city's South Side, a stark contrast to the gleaming opulence he's helping to create downtown.
