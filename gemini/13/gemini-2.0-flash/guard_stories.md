Okay, here's a story opening and setting, focusing on a guard named Elias Thorne:

**Setting:**

The wind howled a mournful dirge through the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Tooth Mountains, clawing at the ancient stone of Shadowgate Keep. Built into the mountainside like a festering wound, the Keep was more a symbol of dread than a bastion of defense. Rain, icy and relentless, plastered everything in a sheen of perpetual dampness. The air tasted of iron and decay. Inside, flickering torches cast grotesque shadows that danced across the damp stone walls, barely piercing the oppressive gloom. The common areas of the Keep were filled with the murmur of bored soldiers and the clatter of poorly maintained armor. Further within, however, was an eerie silence that clung to the dungeons below, a place where even the toughest guards held their breath a little longer.

**Opening:**

Elias Thorne, his face etched with the harsh lines of thirty years spent battling the elements and the enemies of the realm, adjusted the leather straps of his worn breastplate. The dampness had already seeped through his woolen tunic, chilling him to the bone. Tonight was particularly unforgiving, even for Shadowgate. He spat a wad of phlegm onto the muddy ground, watching it disappear into the grime. The rhythmic clang of his halberd against the stone floor echoed through the otherwise silent corridor as he began his patrol, a sentinel against a threat he wasn't even sure existed anymore. Years ago, Shadowgate had been a crucial line of defense against the barbarians from the Northern Wastes, but those days were long past. Now, it was a prison, a place where dissidents, criminals, and those who had simply fallen out of favor with the King were left to rot. Elias felt like he was rotting right along with them. He paused outside the heavy iron door to Cell Block D, the most notorious section of the dungeons, and his hand instinctively went to the hilt of his sword. A low, guttural moan drifted from within, raising the hairs on the back of his neck. It was just the prisoners, he told himself, just the madmen. But tonight, the moan sounded different, deeper, laced with a primal terror that Elias couldn't quite explain.
