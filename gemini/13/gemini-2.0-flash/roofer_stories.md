The smell of hot asphalt and sweat clung to Jebediah Eliason like a second skin. He adjusted his tool belt, the leather groaning a familiar complaint, and squinted against the blinding glare reflected off the freshly laid shingles. The mid-August sun beat down with a merciless ferocity, baking the tar paper beneath his boots to a sticky, pliable mess. It was the kind of heat that shimmered in the air above the rooftops of Havenwood, Kentucky, turning the sleepy little town into a hazy, dreamlike mirage.

Jebediah was perched on the steeply pitched roof of the old Henderson place, a rambling Victorian that had seen better days. Its gingerbread trim was chipped and peeling, the porch sagged precariously, and the roof, well, the roof was Jebediah's current headache. It was a mess of rotting cedar shakes, patched haphazardly with asphalt shingles that looked like mismatched teeth. He'd spent the better part of the morning wrestling with the decaying wood, prying loose stubborn nails that hadn't seen daylight in decades. The only sound besides the hammering and his own ragged breathing was the drone of cicadas, a buzzing symphony of summer exhaustion that seemed to permeate everything. Havenwood, nestled in the foothills of the Appalachians, was a place where time moved slow, and sometimes, Jebediah felt like it was standing still altogether.
