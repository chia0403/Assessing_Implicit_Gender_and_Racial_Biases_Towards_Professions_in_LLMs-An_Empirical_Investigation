Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring a manicurist named Evelyn Grace Bellweather:

**Setting:**

The humid, late afternoon air hung heavy in the brightly-lit interior of "Gilded Hands," a nail salon nestled on a bustling corner of Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village. The aroma of acrylic powder, rose-scented cuticle oil, and subtly stale coffee mingled in the air, a familiar perfume to anyone who frequented the establishment.  Rows of neatly organized polish bottles, shimmering in every color imaginable, lined the walls, reflecting the fluorescent lights above.  Three manicure stations sat empty, awaiting their next clients.  In the back, behind a curtain of shimmering gold beads, was the pedicure station â€“ a luxurious haven of plush velvet and steaming foot baths.  The rhythmic whir of the ventilation system, battling valiantly against the fumes, provided a constant, low hum.

**Opening:**

Evelyn Grace Bellweather hummed along to a forgotten pop song crackling from the tiny speaker perched precariously on the counter. Her fingers, nimble and precise, danced across the polished surface of a false nail, applying a delicate filigree of silver glitter with a brush so fine it looked like a single strand of spider silk. The late afternoon slump was hitting hard, and only the rhythmic precision of her work, and the promise of a large tip from her next client, Mrs. Abernathy, kept her focused. A bead of sweat trickled down her temple, and she brushed it away with the back of her hand, leaving a faint shimmer of silver dust on her skin. Evelyn glanced at the clock. Almost five. Just one more set of acrylics to go, and she could finally escape the saccharine-sweet tyranny of "Gilded Hands" and its ever-demanding clientele. Today felt heavier than usual, though. A strange tingling sensation lingered at the base of her neck, a feeling like she was being watched, even though the salon was eerily empty. Maybe it was just the caffeine withdrawal. Or maybe, just maybe, it was something else entirely.
