Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring an occupational therapist:

**Story Opening:**

The rhythmic squeak of rubber soles against linoleum was the soundtrack to Amelia Grace Harding's morning. It accompanied her silent pep talk – a constant, internal mantra of "Be patient. Be creative. Be the damn lighthouse in this storm" – as she navigated the brightly lit, but perpetually understaffed, halls of Meadowbrook Rehabilitation Center. The air hung thick with the scent of antiseptic, stale coffee, and a faint undercurrent of… defeat. She hated that last one.

Amelia smoothed down the crisp, ironed folds of her floral-print scrubs, a deliberate choice to inject a small dose of normalcy into the sterile environment. Today was Mrs. Gable's discharge day, a victory she’d worked tirelessly to achieve. But as Amelia neared Mrs. Gable's room, 312, a knot of anxiety tightened in her stomach. She knew Mrs. Gable was ready, physically. It was the fear in the older woman’s eyes, the hesitant tremor in her hands when she spoke of going home, that bothered Amelia.

Taking a deep breath, Amelia plastered on her most encouraging smile. "Showtime," she whispered to herself, pushing open the door.

**Setting:**

The story is primarily set within **Meadowbrook Rehabilitation Center**, a mid-sized, not-for-profit facility located in the outskirts of a quiet, aging suburb of Cleveland, Ohio. The center caters to a wide range of patients, from those recovering from strokes and surgeries to individuals managing chronic conditions like arthritis and Parkinson's disease.

The building itself is a rectangular, brick structure built in the 1970s. Its interior is characterized by:

*   **Long, linoleum-floored hallways:** These are painted a pale, institutional green and are lined with nursing stations, equipment storage closets, and patient rooms.
*   **Patient rooms:** These are sparsely furnished with a hospital bed, a bedside table, a small dresser, and a television mounted on the wall. Attempts have been made to personalize the rooms with cheerful curtains and inspirational artwork, but the underlying sense of transience remains.
*   **The Occupational Therapy Gym:** This is a larger, more open space filled with various pieces of equipment designed to help patients regain functional skills. There are parallel bars, a simulated kitchen, a mock bathroom, and tables for fine motor activities. The walls are adorned with motivational posters and charts tracking patient progress. The Occupational Therapy Gym also has a kitchenette with a sink and mini refrigerator.
*   **The Staff Lounge:** A small, utilitarian room with mismatched furniture, a coffee machine that perpetually gurgles, and a bulletin board overflowing with announcements, flyers, and staff photos. This is where the therapists and nurses gather for brief respite and to exchange updates.

Beyond the physical structure, the setting is also defined by the socio-economic realities of the surrounding community. Meadowbrook serves a population that is increasingly elderly and often faces challenges with access to healthcare and financial resources. This adds another layer of complexity to Amelia's work, as she not only has to address her patients' physical limitations but also navigate the bureaucratic hurdles and emotional challenges they face.
