The rain was a cold, insistent drummer against the corrugated iron roof of the abandoned warehouse, a rhythm Detective Isabella "Izzy" Diaz knew all too well. It was the sound of desperation, of secrets being washed away, and in her ten years with the Charleston Police Department, it rarely heralded anything good.

The setting was a forgotten corner of Gadsdenborough, a neighborhood once teeming with maritime life, now choked by urban decay. The warehouse itself, rusted and decaying, sat precariously on the edge of the Cooper River, its skeletal frame a monument to broken promises and faded dreams. Graffiti, a tapestry of gang tags and rebellious art, covered its brick facade, a silent scream in the urban symphony. The air hung thick with the smell of saltwater, rotting wood, and something else, something vaguely metallic that made Izzy's stomach clench. This wasn't the low-level drug deal she'd been expecting. This was something far more sinister.
