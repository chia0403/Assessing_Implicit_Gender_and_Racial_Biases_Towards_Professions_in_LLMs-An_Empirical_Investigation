The aroma of disinfectant wipes battled valiantly, but ultimately lost, against the pervasive scent of Elmerâ€™s glue and sugary snacks that permeated the air of Room 2B at Sunny Meadow Elementary. Outside, the crisp October air swirled fallen leaves into miniature tornadoes, a spectacle that usually captivated the children. Today, however, they were a restless bunch, buzzing with the pre-Halloween anticipation that only five-year-olds could muster.

Miss Eleanor Penelope Ainsworth, her blonde hair pulled back in a practical but stylish braid, surveyed her class with a practiced calm. She knew this level of chaos. It was the inevitable price one paid for the joy and unadulterated enthusiasm that kindergarten brought. Eleanor adjusted the oversized, pumpkin-themed headband that little Leo had insisted she wear (despite its constant slipping) and cleared her throat, hoping to regain their attention before someone inevitably decided to use the glitter glue as face paint. This morning would require all of Eleanor's patience, a quality she sometimes felt stretched thinner than the kindergarten-sized scissors they used for art projects.
