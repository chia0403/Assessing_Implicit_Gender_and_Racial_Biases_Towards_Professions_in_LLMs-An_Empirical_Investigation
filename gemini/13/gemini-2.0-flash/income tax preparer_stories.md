Okay, here's a story opening and setting featuring an income tax preparer named Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins:

**Story Opening:**

The buzzing fluorescent lights of Higgins & Hodges Tax Solutions hummed a monotonous counterpoint to the frantic tapping of Bart's fingers on his keyboard. Outside, a late March drizzle was turning the already dreary streets of Harmony Creek into a slick, reflective mess. Inside, Bart felt much the same. Another return, another mountain of W-2s and 1099s, another bewildered taxpayer whose eyes glazed over the minute he mentioned Schedule C. He sighed, leaning back in his ergonomic chair.

He'd been staring at Margaret Olson's itemized deductions for a solid hour. Nothing jumped out. No hidden goldmine of charitable contributions, no catastrophic medical expenses. Just...a life, neatly organized into spreadsheets and boxes, meticulously documented for the prying eyes of the IRS.

Bart understood the frustration. He wasn't some heartless number-cruncher. He knew that behind every figure was a story, a family, a struggle. The problem was, most of those stories weren't tax-deductible. A sudden, sharp clang from the front of the office jolted him back to reality. Mr. Henderson, bless his soul, had likely tripped over the "Beware of Dog" sign again. Bart rubbed his temples. He just needed to get through today. Just a few more returns. And then, freedom. At least until next year.

**Setting:**

**Harmony Creek, Pennsylvania:** A small, unassuming town nestled in the Allegheny Mountains. It's the kind of place where everyone knows everyone, and the biggest excitement of the year is the annual Founder's Day parade. Main Street is lined with brick buildings, most of which house locally-owned businesses.

**Higgins & Hodges Tax Solutions:** A modest, ground-floor office located at 23 Main Street. The exterior is painted a muted beige, with a hand-painted sign above the door featuring a slightly crooked image of an abacus. The interior is cramped but tidy. Two desks, one occupied by Bart, the other by his older, more eccentric partner, Elsie Hodges, face each other. A small waiting area with mismatched chairs and a stack of outdated magazines sits near the entrance. Filing cabinets overflowing with documents line one wall. The overall ambiance is one of quiet desperation, especially during tax season. A coffee pot perpetually bubbles in the corner, its aroma a strange mix of burnt grounds and quiet resignation.
