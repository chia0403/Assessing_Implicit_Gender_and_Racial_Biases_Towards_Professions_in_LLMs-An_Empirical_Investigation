## Story Opening & Setting:

**Setting:** Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Leo Maxwell's office, a relentless drumming that mirrored the throbbing in his temples. The office itself, perched precariously on the third floor of a pre-war building in the Skid Row district of Detroit, was a study in organized chaos. File cabinets overflowed with yellowing folders, stacks of newspapers threatened to topple from precarious heights, and the air hung thick with the aroma of stale coffee and cheap cigarettes. The only splashes of color were the luridly framed, knock-off Van Gogh prints that Leo swore he'd replace someday (someday being the operative word). Outside, the sodium lights cast a sickly orange glow on the rain-slicked streets, painting a picture of urban decay as picturesque as it was depressing.

**Opening:**

The knock, when it came, was tentative, almost apologetic. **Leonard "Leo" Maxwell**, the aforementioned private detective and current occupant of this charmingly dilapidated space, barely registered it at first, too engrossed in trying to coax a flame from his sputtering lighter. He finally managed a flickering spark, inhaled deeply, and then, with a sigh that seemed to carry the weight of a thousand lost causes, barked, "Come in! If you're the damn landlord, the rent check's in the mail... metaphorically, of course." The door creaked open, revealing not the perpetually disgruntled Mr. Henderson, but a figure shrouded in shadow, even darker than the already gloomy hallway. And Leo Maxwell, despite his fondness for cheap whiskey and even cheaper thrills, suddenly felt a prickle of unease crawl down his spine. This wasn't going to be about a missing cat.
