It wasn't just the chill seeping in from the perpetually cracked window next to her table; it was the gnawing anxiety that had taken up permanent residence in her stomach. Tonight was her second Tuesday night gig here, her second chance to prove she could draw a crowd, her second chance to convince herself she hadnâ€™t made a colossal mistake abandoning her comfortable but soul-crushing office job for the precarious dream of a singing career. Her name, Eleanor Beatrice Davies, deserved to be emblazoned on a marquee, not whispered between sips of watered-down beer in a place like this. She just had to get people to believe it too.
