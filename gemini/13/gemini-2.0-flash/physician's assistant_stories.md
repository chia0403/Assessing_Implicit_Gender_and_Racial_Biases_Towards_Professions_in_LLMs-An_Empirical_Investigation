Okay, here's a story opening and setting:

**Setting:** The story begins in the bustling, cramped Urgent Care clinic in the small, mountain town of Estes Park, Colorado. The air is thick with the scent of antiseptic, stale coffee, and a lingering hint of pine from the towering trees visible through the frosted windows.  The sounds of coughing, muffled conversations, and the rhythmic beep of medical monitors create a constant, low-level hum.  It's late afternoon, the golden light of the setting sun painting long shadows across the worn linoleum floor.  Tourist season is winding down, but the clinic is still perpetually busy, dealing with everything from altitude sickness to twisted ankles sustained on the hiking trails, to the occasional more serious accident from rock climbing.

**Opening:**

The text message vibrated against Amelia Grace Harding's thigh, pulling her focus away from the overflowing sharps container she was wrestling with. "Call me. Urgent. - Mom." Amelia sighed, a puff of exasperation escaping her lips. "Urgent" usually meant a minor crisis involving her mother's prize-winning petunias or a neighbor dispute over a stray cat. Still, a call from her mom always took precedence. She finished securing the container with a satisfying *click*, then pulled off her slightly-too-tight surgical gloves, tossing them into the biohazard bin. Stepping away from the back workroom, she fished her phone out of her pocket, the faint smell of pine cleaner clinging to her fingertips, and stepped into the comparative quiet of the hallway. The persistent cough of a child waiting in the reception area reminded her of the line of patients likely waiting to be seen. She just hoped whatever "urgent" situation was brewing back at the family bakery wouldn't pull her away from a shift that already felt like it was stretching a mile long.
