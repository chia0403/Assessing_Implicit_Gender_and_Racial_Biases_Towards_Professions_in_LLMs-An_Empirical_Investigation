## Story Opening and Setting

**Setting:** The dingy fluorescent lights of Goldstein & Sons Accounting in downtown Pittsburgh buzzed a monotonous tune, a tune that echoed the humdrum rhythm of Eleanor Albright's life. The office itself was a time capsule, trapped somewhere between the late 1980s and early 2000s, a testament to the firm's, and perhaps Eleanor's, resistance to change. Mustard-yellow cubicle walls, stained with coffee rings and the faint scent of stale paperwork, hemmed her in. A stack of invoices, teetering precariously on her desk, threatened to avalanche at any moment, a metaphor, she felt, for her current mental state. Outside, the early October rain lashed against the grime-coated window, blurring the already lackluster view of the Allegheny River.

**Opening:** Eleanor Albright, a woman who believed devoutly in debits and credits, order and spreadsheets, stared blankly at the tax form mocking her from the screen. It was a Tuesday, just like any other Tuesday. Or so it had seemed until Mildred from reception had shuffled over with a new client file, whispering, "Mr. Silas Blackwood. Real… eccentric, that one. And rich. Very, very rich." Eleanor, usually unfazed by the oddities of Pittsburgh’s diverse clientele, had accepted the file with a practiced smile and a mental note to add it to the ever-growing 'Urgent' pile. Now, three hours later, surrounded by printouts and scratching her head so hard she was sure she’d pulled out a strand of hair, she understood Mildred's hesitation. This wasn't just eccentric; this was downright baffling. Silas Blackwood's declared income was… non-existent. Yet, his declared expenses included "dragon feed," "fairy dust," and "ritual purification bath bombs." Eleanor sighed. This was going to be a long week.
