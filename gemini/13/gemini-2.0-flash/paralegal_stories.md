Okay, here's a story opening and setting, featuring a paralegal named:

**Main Character:** Eleanor "Ellie" Vance

**Setting:** A cramped, cluttered office on the third floor of a pre-war building in the historic district of Savannah, Georgia. The office, shared by the law firm of Dubois & Pritchard, overlooks Chippewa Square. The air is thick with the scent of old paper, stale coffee, and a faint, lingering hint of jasmine from the courtyard below.

**Opening:**

The humid Savannah air hung heavy in Eleanor Vance's lungs as she wrestled with the window, finally managing to coax it open with a frustrated grunt. Chippewa Square, usually a welcome sight, was today just a green, hazy blur through the grimy pane. Honestly, sometimes Ellie felt like she was permanently coated in a layer of dust and regret â€“ a fine powder that settled into the creases of her skin, mirroring the fine print she spent her days dissecting.

Another case file loomed on her desk, a mountain of depositions and witness statements threatening to topple onto her precarious stack of bills. "Jenkins vs. Savannah Port Authority," the label declared in Mr. Dubois' booming, self-important scrawl. Ellie sighed, a sound like air leaking from a punctured tire. She'd been chasing down leads in this worker's comp nightmare for weeks, and it felt like the deeper she dug, the muddier the waters became. She scrubbed a hand over her tired eyes, the fluorescent light of her desk lamp doing little to dispel the headache brewing behind them.

"Another day, another dollar," she muttered, though neither was particularly true. Especially the 'dollar' part. She was barely making enough to cover rent, let alone the student loans that haunted her like restless ghosts. Ellie Vance, paralegal extraordinaire, destined to be forever buried under a landslide of paperwork and the ghosts of other people's bad decisions. And all before she'd even had her first cup of coffee.
