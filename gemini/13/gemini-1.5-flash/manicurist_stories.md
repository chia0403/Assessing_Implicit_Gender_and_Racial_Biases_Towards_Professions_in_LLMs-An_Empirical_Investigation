The scent of acetone and lavender hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Seraphina Evangeline Moreau.  Seraphina, or “Sera” as her clients affectionately (and sometimes desperately) called her, meticulously buffed the chipped coral polish from Mrs. Gable’s already-brittle nails.  The air in "Nails of Grace," her tiny salon tucked away on a cobblestone side street in the historic French Quarter of New Orleans, throbbed with the humid, sultry heat of a late August afternoon.  Cicadas buzzed a relentless soundtrack outside, their chirps a counterpoint to the rhythmic rasp of the buffer against Mrs. Gable’s fingernails.  Rain threatened, the sky a bruised purple canvas hinting at the impending downpour, mirroring the storm brewing in Sera’s own life.  She’d been avoiding the phone, a small, pink, almost comical thing buzzing persistently under a pile of discarded nail files.  It wasn’t just any phone call she was dreading.
