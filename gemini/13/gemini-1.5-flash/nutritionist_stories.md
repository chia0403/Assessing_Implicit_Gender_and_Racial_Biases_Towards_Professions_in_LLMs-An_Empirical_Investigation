The chipped paint of the peeling windowsill flaked onto Dr. Eleanor Vance’s crisp white lab coat as she watched the relentless drizzle lash against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic.  Grey skies mirrored the grey interior of the ramshackle building, a stark contrast to the vibrant colours of the nutritional charts pinned haphazardly to the faded green walls.
