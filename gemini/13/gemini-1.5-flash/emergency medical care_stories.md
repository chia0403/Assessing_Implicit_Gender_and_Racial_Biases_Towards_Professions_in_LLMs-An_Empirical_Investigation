The siren’s wail was a familiar lullaby to Dr. Elias Thorne, a rhythm that pulsed through the cramped confines of the ambulance, vibrating in the worn leather of his seat.  Rain lashed against the windows, blurring the already indistinct cityscape of Seattle into a swirling grey canvas.  Each drop seemed to mirror the frantic beat of the heart monitor beside him, a relentless counterpoint to the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of the vehicle’s tires on the slick asphalt.  The air hung thick with the metallic tang of blood and the sharp, antiseptic scent of the cleaning supplies Elias hadn't had time to properly stow away after his last call – a nasty fall from a scaffolding, leaving a young man with a fractured femur and a shaken ego. Tonight, however, the radio crackled with a different urgency, a chilling brevity that sent a shiver down Elias's spine despite the humid heat radiating from the ambulance's engine. The dispatcher’s voice, usually calm and efficient, was strained, almost whispered:  "Multiple casualties, suspected explosion, Pier 57. Code Red, Thorne.  ETA: five minutes."
