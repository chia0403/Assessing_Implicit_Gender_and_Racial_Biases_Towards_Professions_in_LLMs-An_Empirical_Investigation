The wind, a relentless sculptor, carved patterns into the snowdrifts that blanketed the Broken Tooth Ranch.  It howled a mournful tune through the skeletal branches of the junipers, a sound as familiar to Silas "Buck" Blackwood as the creak of his own worn leather boots.  Buck, at sixty-two, was as weathered and resilient as the ancient Ponderosa pines clinging to the mountainside above his ranch. His face, a roadmap of sun-baked wrinkles etched by years of squinting into the unforgiving Wyoming sun, was currently framed by a thick, salt-and-pepper beard frosted with ice crystals.  The air, biting and sharp, stung his lungs with each ragged breath he drew, but Buck didn't flinch.  He'd faced worse. Much worse. This brutal winter, however, promised to be a challenge even for a man as hardened as him. The storm, raging for three days now, showed no signs of letting up, and the dwindling supplies in the ranch's meager storehouse were a stark reminder of the isolation that clung to Broken Tooth like a shroud.
