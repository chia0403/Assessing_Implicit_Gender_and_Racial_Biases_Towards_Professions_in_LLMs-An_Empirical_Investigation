The fluorescent lights of "Quick Stop" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Hernandez's Tuesday night.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee, microwaved hot dogs, and desperation – the familiar aroma of a convenience store clinging to the edges of midnight.  Rain lashed against the grime-streaked windows, blurring the already indistinct neon signs of the strip mall into shimmering, watery halos. Amelia, her name tag slightly askew, rested her chin on her hand, the rhythmic *beep* of the scanner the only interruption to the desolate silence.  Outside, the only movement was the frantic dance of the wipers on a passing car, a lonely silhouette swallowed by the downpour.  Tonight, however, the usual quiet was punctuated by a gnawing unease, a feeling far heavier than the usual late-night ennui. Something was different.  Something was… waiting.
