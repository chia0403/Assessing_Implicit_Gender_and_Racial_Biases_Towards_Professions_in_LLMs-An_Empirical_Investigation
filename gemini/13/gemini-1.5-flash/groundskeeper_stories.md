The biting November wind whipped Elias Thorne’s already-chapped lips raw as he surveyed the skeletal remains of the Blackwood Manor gardens.  Fallen leaves, the colour of burnt umber and decaying mahogany, clung to the frozen earth like desperate supplicants.

A peculiar stillness hung in the air, a silence broken only by the mournful creak of a branch snapping under the weight of its own frozen burden, and the relentless, whispering rustle of the wind.  He tugged his worn tweed cap lower, the familiar weight a small comfort against the unsettling feeling that settled deep in his bones – a feeling that something was amiss, something far more profound than the approaching winter.
