The biting Alaskan wind howled a mournful song around Captain Evelyn "Evie" Reed's battered Cessna 185, the canvas flaps flapping like a distressed bird's wings.  Below, the Chugach Mountains, a jagged spine of granite and ice, clawed at the bruised twilight sky, their peaks shrouded in a swirling, ethereal mist that promised both beauty and peril.  Evie checked her altimeter – a needle stubbornly refusing to budge above 3,000 feet – then squinted through the frosted cockpit window at the increasingly blurry outline of the glacier ahead.  The radio crackled with static, a frustrating counterpoint to the rhythmic thrum of the aging engine.  Tonight's flight, a medical evacuation from a remote research station nestled deep within the mountains, was proving more challenging than even Evie, with her ten years of navigating these treacherous Alaskan skies, had anticipated.
