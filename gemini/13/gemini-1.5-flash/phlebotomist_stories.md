The fluorescent lights of the Meadowbrook Medical Clinic hummed a monotonous tune, a counterpoint to the rhythmic *thump-thump-thump* of Amelia Katherine “Amy” Hayes’s own pulse.  Amy, a phlebotomist with a penchant for precisely-placed bandaids and an uncanny ability to find veins even in the most stubbornly vein-resistant patients, adjusted the worn leather strap of her phlebotomy bag.  The scent of antiseptic, faint but persistent, hung in the air, mingling with the slightly sweeter aroma of hand sanitizer and the underlying, almost metallic tang of fear that clung to the waiting room like a stubborn stain.  Outside, the late August sun beat down on the cracked asphalt of the parking lot, a stark contrast to the cool, sterile environment within.  Today, however, the usual quiet efficiency of the clinic was disrupted. A low murmur, punctuated by the occasional sharp intake of breath, emanated from the examination room down the hall – a sound that, even to Amy’s seasoned ears, promised something decidedly… unusual.
