The scent of argan oil and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Seraphina Evangeline Moreau.  Seraphina, or "Sera" as her clients affectionately called her, surveyed her salon, "Shear Brilliance," with a critical eye.  Dust motes danced in the late afternoon sun streaming through the large, arched windows that overlooked the bustling cobblestone streets of Montmartre.  Outside, the cacophony of Parisian life – the rumble of Vespas, the chatter of tourists, the melodic strains of a street musician’s accordion – faded into a pleasant hum against the muted elegance of her salon.  Inside, the walls were painted a soft, dove grey, punctuated by vibrant pops of color from framed vintage posters of iconic French film stars and meticulously arranged displays of high-end hair products.  A single, crimson rose sat in a delicate vase on the antique mahogany counter, a stark contrast to the otherwise minimalist décor.  Tonight, however, the usual serene atmosphere was tinged with a nervous energy.  Sera had a very important client arriving shortly – a client who could make or break her burgeoning business.
