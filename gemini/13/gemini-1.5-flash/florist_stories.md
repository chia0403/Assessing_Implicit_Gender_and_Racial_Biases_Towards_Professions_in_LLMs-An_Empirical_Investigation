The scent of rain-soaked petrichor hung heavy in the air, mingling with the intoxicating perfume of lilies and jasmine that spilled from the open doorway of "Petals & Promises."  Inside, Amelia Rose Hawthorne, owner and chief floral arranger, hummed a low, almost mournful tune as she carefully pruned a wilting rose.  The tiny bell above the door chimed, a discordant note against the symphony of floral aromas, jolting Amelia from her reverie.  Rain lashed against the antique windowpanes of her shop, a cozy haven tucked away on a cobbled side street in the ancient, rain-lashed town of Oakhaven.  The flickering gaslight above the counter cast long shadows that danced across the vibrant blooms â€“ a kaleidoscope of colour in the gloom of the approaching twilight.
