The humid Louisiana air hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine and impending rain.  Cicadas buzzed a relentless, rhythmic chorus that vibrated through Dr. Eleanor Vance’s bones, a counterpoint to the low thrum of the swamp’s hidden life just beyond the cypress trees bordering her clinic.  Her small, shingle-style building, painted a cheerful but slightly faded yellow, sat perched precariously on a rise overlooking the bayou.  The sign, “Vance Chiropractic – Gentle Adjustments, Lasting Relief,” creaked gently in the breeze, its faded lettering barely visible through the relentless onslaught of Spanish moss.  Inside, the air was cool and smelled faintly of antiseptic and lavender, a welcome change from the oppressive humidity outside.  Eleanor, her auburn hair pulled back in a practical braid, sat at her desk, the late afternoon sun casting long shadows across the meticulously organized paperwork.  The quiet was broken only by the occasional croak of a frog and the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock in the corner, a relic from her grandmother, a woman whose own strong back had weathered decades of Louisiana summers.
