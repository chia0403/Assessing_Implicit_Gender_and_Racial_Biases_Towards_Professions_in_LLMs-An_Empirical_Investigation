The bell above the door of "Apothecary's Rest" jingled, a discordant chime against the hushed reverence of the shop.  Dust motes, illuminated by the afternoon sun slanting through the tall, arched windows, danced in the air, momentarily obscuring the rows of amber apothecary jars lining the mahogany shelves.  The scent of dried herbs – chamomile, lavender, a hint of something more exotic and subtly spicy – hung heavy and comforting in the air.  Behind the counter, meticulously arranging a new shipment of tinctures, stood  Dr. Eleanor Vance, her fingers, long and elegant, tracing the delicate script on each tiny label.  The year was 1888, and the town of Oakhaven, nestled deep in the Appalachian foothills, held its secrets close, much like Eleanor herself.
