The biting November wind whipped Amelia Hernandez’s charcoal-grey coat around her legs as she stood perched precariously on the scaffolding, the city a dizzying panorama spread below.  Rain, a fine, insistent drizzle, plastered strands of her dark hair to her forehead.

The scent of damp concrete and exhaust fumes hung heavy in the air, a pungent perfume only an architect could truly appreciate.
