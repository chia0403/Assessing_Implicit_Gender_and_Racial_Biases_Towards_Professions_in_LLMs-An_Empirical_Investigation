The biting November wind whipped Amelia Hawthorne’s hair across her face as she trudged through the ankle-deep mud of the sanctuary grounds.  Rain, a relentless drizzle that had fallen for three days straight, clung to the grey wool of her coat, weighing it down like a shroud.  Around her, the sprawling Redwood National and State Parks stretched out in a damp, almost mournful expanse of towering trees, their ancient limbs dripping with water.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth, pine needles, and something else… something faintly metallic, that tugged at the edges of her awareness.  Amelia, head zookeeper at the Redwood Ridge Wildlife Rehabilitation Center, squinted through the downpour.  The metallic tang intensified as she approached the perimeter fence, its rusted wire barely visible through the thick undergrowth.  Something was wrong. Very wrong.
