The biting November wind whipped at Elias Thorne’s thick wool coat, stinging his cheeks raw as he surveyed the skeletal frame of the new skyscraper.  He wasn’t a man given to romanticizing his work, but even Elias, a seasoned construction worker with calloused hands and a permanently sun-weathered face, had to admit the city spread out below, a glittering tapestry woven with a million tiny lights, was a breathtaking sight from this height.  The steel girders, cold and unforgiving under his gloved touch, hummed with the faint vibrations of the city’s restless heart.  Below, the cacophony of honking horns and distant sirens was muted, a low, rumbling undercurrent to the rhythmic clang of hammers and the whirring of power tools echoing from the construction site – his own personal symphony of progress.  The air, thick with the scent of cement, dust, and exhaust fumes, carried the sharp tang of impending rain.  Tonight, however, the city held its breath, anticipating the spectacle of the first real snowfall of the season.
