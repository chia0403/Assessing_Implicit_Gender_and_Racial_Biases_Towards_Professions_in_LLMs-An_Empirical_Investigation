The chipped paint of the "Sunshine Smiles Daycare" sign flaked onto the already overflowing recycling bin, mirroring the chaotic energy spilling from within.  Amelia Hernandez, a whirlwind of brightly colored sweaters and perpetually tangled brown hair, wrestled a giggling three-year-old named Leo away from a precarious stack of building blocks, his small hands smeared with what Amelia strongly suspected was peanut butter and glitter. The air hung thick with the aroma of impending naptime – a potent cocktail of spilled milk, wet paint, and vaguely floral hand sanitizer.  Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the overgrown lawn, the chirping of crickets a stark contrast to the cacophony of children's voices vying for attention.  Amelia sighed, a weary but fond smile playing on her lips. Another day, another delightful – and slightly terrifying – adventure at Sunshine Smiles.
