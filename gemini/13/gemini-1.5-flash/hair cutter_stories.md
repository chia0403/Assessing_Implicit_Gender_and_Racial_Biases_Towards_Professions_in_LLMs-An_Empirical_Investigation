The scent of rosemary and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a perfume unique to "Shear Genius," Aurelia "Auri" Blackwood's one-woman hair salon.  Nestled on the cobbled side street of a quaint, perpetually-twilight village called Oakhaven, the salon was a converted carriage house, its aged brick walls stained a deep, almost plum colour by years of rain and ivy.  Auri, with her fingers stained a vibrant crimson from a recent dye job mishap and her usually pristine apron speckled with stray hairs of every imaginable shade, expertly snipped at a client's unruly curls.  The only sounds besides the rhythmic *snip-snip* of her shears were the gentle patter of rain against the leaded glass windows and the low hum of Oakhaven's secrets, whispered on the wind.
