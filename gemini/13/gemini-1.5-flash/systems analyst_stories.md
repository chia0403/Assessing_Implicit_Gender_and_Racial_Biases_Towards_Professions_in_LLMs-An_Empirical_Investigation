The fluorescent hum of the server room was a constant, low thrum in the background of Elias Thorne's life.  Elias, a systems analyst for the monolithic corporation known as OmniCorp, found a strange solace in its sterile environment.  The air, perpetually chilled to a bone-deep 68 degrees, smelled faintly of ozone and stale coffee â€“ a scent he'd come to associate with the quiet efficiency he strived for in his own life. Tonight, however, the usual hum was punctuated by a disconcerting whine, a high-pitched keening that vibrated not just in the air, but deep in Elias's teeth.  He stood before a wall of blinking lights, each a tiny, defiant eye staring back at him from the heart of OmniCorp's data center, a cathedral of information threatening to crumble into digital dust.  Outside, the city of Denver raged with a late-summer thunderstorm, mirroring the chaos brewing within the server racks.
