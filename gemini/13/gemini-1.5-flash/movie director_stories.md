The biting November wind whipped Amelia “Amy” Worthington’s auburn hair across her face as she surveyed the desolate, windswept landscape.  Grey, churning clouds hung low over the stark, skeletal branches of the ancient oak trees that clawed at the bruised, purple sky above the fictional town of Havenwood, nestled deep within the fictional county of Blackwood, Maine.  Havenwood, with its population barely scraping three hundred souls and a single, dilapidated general store, was far from the glamorous Hollywood Amy was used to.  But it was here, in this forgotten corner of New England, that Amy intended to film her magnum opus: "The Shepherd's Lament," a gothic thriller promising to be her most ambitious project yet.  The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and pine needles, held a chilling beauty that perfectly mirrored the dark heart of her story.  This wasn't just a film location; it was a character in itself.
