The chill wind, sharp as a cleaver, sliced through Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's thick wool coat.  He tugged his worn leather apron tighter, the scent of sawdust and rendered fat clinging to it like a second skin.  Barty, proprietor of Butterfield's Butchers – a shop as old as the cobblestones of Oakhaven’s High Street – squinted at the pre-dawn gloom.  The streetlamps, casting a sickly yellow glow, barely pierced the thick fog that hung heavy over the ancient town, swallowing the half-timbered houses whole.  A single, stray dog shivered in a doorway across the street, its ribs visible beneath its matted fur, a mirror of the lean times that had settled over Oakhaven like the morning mist.  Inside Butterfield’s, the air was warmer, a comforting blend of blood, bone, and the earthy sweetness of herbs.  But even the comforting warmth couldn't entirely dispel the unease that had settled in Barty's gut, a feeling colder than the November wind.  Something was different this morning, something…wrong.
