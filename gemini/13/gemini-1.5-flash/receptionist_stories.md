The fluorescent lights of "Sterling & Steele, Attorneys at Law" hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to Amelia Katherine Davies's otherwise silent existence.  Amelia, or Amy as she preferred, perched on her stool behind the mahogany reception desk, the polished surface reflecting her own tired face back at her.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight slicing through the otherwise gloom of the opulent, yet strangely depressing, waiting room.  Leather armchairs, the colour of aged burgundy, stood in stiff rows, their silent occupants long gone for the day, leaving behind only the faint scent of expensive cologne and the lingering chill of the air conditioning.  Outside, the city of Chicago roared, a vibrant contrast to the hushed stillness within Sterling & Steele, a stillness that Amy found both comforting and suffocating.
