The fluorescent hum of the drafting room was Elias Thorne’s lullaby.  For twenty-three years, Elias, a man whose life revolved around the precise angles of T-squares and the satisfying scratch of pencil on mylar, had woken to it, worked by it, and, on particularly stressful days, even dreamt it.  Dust motes, illuminated by the harsh overhead lights, danced in the still air of the office, mirroring the intricate network of lines crisscrossing the vast blueprints spread across his drafting table.  The air smelled faintly of stale coffee, ink, and the peculiar, almost medicinal, scent of ammonia from the freshly-cleaned drafting tools – a scent Elias found oddly comforting.  Outside, the relentless Chicago wind howled, a stark contrast to the meticulous calm within the walls of Peterson & Sons Architectural Design.  This morning, however, the usual hum was punctuated by a nervous tapping at Elias's elbow, a rhythm far more unsettling than the city's winter symphony.
