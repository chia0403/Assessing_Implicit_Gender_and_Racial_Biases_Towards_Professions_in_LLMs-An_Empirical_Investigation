The chipped paint on the windowsill was a cerulean so vibrant, it practically screamed at Seraphina "Sera" Bellweather.  It was a scream she found oddly comforting, a counterpoint to the oppressive beige that suffocated the rest of the room.  Sera, a woman whose life revolved around the strategic placement of throw pillows and the judicious use of accent lighting, found herself staring out at the rain-lashed London street from the window of a house that was less a home and more a mausoleum of bad taste.  Number 13 Grimalkin Lane lived up to its name; dark oak paneling that seemed to absorb all light, heavy velvet curtains the color of a bruise, and a general air of dust motes and forgotten sorrows hung heavy in the air. The only bright spot, besides that defiant cerulean, was the client herself,  Mrs. Eleanor Ainsworth, a formidable woman with eyes like glacial ice and a handbag that probably cost more than Sera's car.  This was not going to be a simple redecoration; this was an exorcism of design.
