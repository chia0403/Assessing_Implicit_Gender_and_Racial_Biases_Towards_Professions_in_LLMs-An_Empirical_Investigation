The salt spray stung Aurelia Blackwoodâ€™s face, a familiar discomfort she welcomed as a bracing counterpoint to the simmering anxiety churning in her gut.

The lighthouse, perched on the windswept cliffs of the remote Cornish island of St. Keverne, was a stark contrast to the quaint, ivy-covered cottages she normally called home. It was a place of isolation, a place of secrets, and a place where she hoped to find the inspiration to finally finish her stalled novel, a historical mystery that had been haunting her for far too long.
