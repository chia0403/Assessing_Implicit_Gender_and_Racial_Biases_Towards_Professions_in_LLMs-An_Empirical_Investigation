The air hung thick and sweet with the cloying scent of bay rum and old leather in Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's barbershop.  Dust motes, illuminated by the single, unshaded bulb hanging precariously over the worn wooden chair, danced in the afternoon sun that slanted through the grimy windowpane. Barty, a man whose face resembled a well-loved, slightly-scuffed leather armchair himself – all deep lines etched by time and laughter –  hummed a jaunty tune under his breath as he expertly honed his straight razor on a worn strop.  Outside, the relentless rhythm of the city throbbed, a constant, muted percussion against the quiet intimacy of his little shop tucked away on the cobbled side street of Hemlock Alley.  It was a place untouched by the glittering modernity creeping into the rest of Blackwood, a refuge from the hurried pace of the new century, and for Barty, it was home.
