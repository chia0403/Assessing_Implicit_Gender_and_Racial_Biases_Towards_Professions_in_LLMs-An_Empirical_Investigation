The biting wind whipped Dr. Eleanor Vance’s long, dark braid across her face as she wrestled the recalcitrant gate of Alder Creek Ranch open.  Frozen chunks of mud clung stubbornly to her worn leather boots, each step a small, gritty victory.  The sky, a bruised purple bleeding into a hesitant grey dawn, mirrored the anxiety churning in her stomach.

The air, crisp and clean, carried a faint, metallic tang that Eleanor couldn’t quite place, adding to the growing sense of foreboding that had plagued her since the frantic call from the ranch owner just before sunrise.  This wasn't a routine farm call; something felt profoundly wrong.
