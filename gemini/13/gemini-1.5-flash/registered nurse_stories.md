The biting November wind whipped Amelia Grace Hawthorne's dark hair across her face as she hurried down the rain-slicked street, the collar of her worn raincoat pulled high.  The scent of woodsmoke and damp earth clung to the air, a stark contrast to the antiseptic smell that permeated her usual environment: St. Jude's Hospital, looming grey and imposing just a block away.  Tonight, however, Amelia wasn't headed for the sterile comfort of her workplace.  She was on her way to a place far less predictable, a ramshackle Victorian house on the edge of Blackwood Forest, its darkened windows hinting at secrets hidden within.  The flickering gaslight of a nearby lamp cast long, dancing shadows, highlighting the decay of the gingerbread trim and the unsettling stillness that hung heavy in the air.  This was not a patient visit; this was a family matter, a tangle of old grudges and whispered fears that Amelia knew she couldn't ignore, even if every instinct screamed at her to run.
