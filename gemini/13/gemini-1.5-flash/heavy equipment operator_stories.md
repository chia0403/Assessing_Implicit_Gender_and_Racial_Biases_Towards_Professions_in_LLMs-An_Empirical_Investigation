The rasp of metal on metal, a sound as familiar to Amelia “Amy” Hernandez as her own heartbeat, sliced through the pre-dawn chill.  Amy, her breath misting in the frigid October air, wrestled the controls of the Caterpillar D6T, its massive treads groaning under the weight of the frozen earth.  The Klondike River, swollen and angry from an early snowfall, grumbled alongside her, its icy breath threatening to freeze the hydraulics.  She was perched high in the cab, a steel fortress against the Alaskan wilderness, the pale light of the rising sun painting the snow-covered peaks a bruised purple.  The air hung thick with the scent of diesel fumes and pine, a smell Amy both hated and loved, a constant reminder of the brutal beauty of her work – and her solitary life – in the remote gold mining town of Chicken, Alaska.
