The scent of aging paper and leather hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Eleanor Vance, Head Librarian of the Silas Weems Memorial Library.  Dust motes, illuminated by the afternoon sun slanting through the tall, gothic windows, danced in the near-silent space.  Outside, a November wind howled a mournful tune, rattling the ancient panes and whipping fallen leaves into frenzied spirals across the manicured lawns.  Inside, however, a profound stillness reigned, broken only by the occasional whisper of turning pages and the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the foyer, its pendulum a metronome keeping time with Eleanor’s own measured, methodical existence.  This was her sanctuary, her kingdom, a fortress of knowledge against the chaos of the outside world – a chaos that, on this particular afternoon, was about to breach its walls.
