The dawn broke over the manicured lawns of Willow Creek Estates, painting the dew-kissed blades of grass in hues of rose and gold.  A chill wind, scented with the sharp tang of pine and damp earth, ruffled the leaves of the ancient oaks that lined the curving driveway.  Amelia “Mia”  Rossetti, her breath misting in the crisp air,  pulled on her worn leather gloves, the scent of damp soil already familiar and comforting.  Her battered pickup truck, a testament to years spent battling overgrown hedges and stubborn weeds, hummed quietly beside her, its tailgate adorned with a faded decal proclaiming "Rossetti Landscaping – We Make Nature Bloom."  This morning, however, Mia wasn’t battling nature; she was battling a deadline, a particularly demanding client, and a nagging suspicion that something very strange was happening in the meticulously landscaped gardens of Willow Creek.
