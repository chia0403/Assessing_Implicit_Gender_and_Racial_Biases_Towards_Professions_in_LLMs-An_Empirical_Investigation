The recycled air hung thick and sweet with the cloying scent of cheap perfume and stale coffee, a familiar perfume to Seraphina "Sera" Dubois.  Sera, a veteran flight attendant with Southwest Airlines, adjusted her meticulously knotted scarlet scarf, the vibrant color a stark contrast to the muted grey of the pre-dawn Los Angeles sky visible through the cockpit window.  The cabin of Flight 1428 to Honolulu was still mostly dark, the passengers slumped in their seats, a tapestry of snoring and hushed anxieties woven amongst the rows.  Outside, the city of angels slept, oblivious to the silent ballet of preparation unfolding above them; a mechanical hum, the gentle hiss of air pressure, and the low murmur of the flight crew prepping for their transpacific journey.  The faint glow of the "Fasten Seatbelts" sign illuminated the faces of her colleagues, each etched with the weary yet familiar anticipation of another day, another flight, another thousand miles above the earth.
