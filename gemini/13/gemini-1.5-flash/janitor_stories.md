The sickly sweet smell of disinfectant clung to Elias Thorne like a second skin, a familiar perfume in the cavernous silence of the Blackwood Academy.  Midnight had long since passed, the echoing halls now devoid of the boisterous laughter and hurried footsteps of students.  Dust motes, illuminated by Eliasâ€™s single, flickering flashlight beam, danced in the shafts of moonlight filtering through the tall, gothic windows.  He pushed his mop across the polished marble floor, the rhythmic swish a counterpoint to the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock somewhere deep within the ancient building, its chimes a mournful lament in the stillness.  Blackwood Academy, with its crumbling grandeur and whispered tales of forgotten tragedies, was Elias's domain, his kingdom of creaking floorboards and dusty tomes, ruled not by kings and queens, but by cobwebs and the ghosts of forgotten exams.
