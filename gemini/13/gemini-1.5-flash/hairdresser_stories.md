The scent of lavender and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a bizarre perfume only Beatrice "Bea" Ainsworth's salon, "Shear Genius," could conjure.  Rain lashed against the oversized bay window of her tiny shop, nestled between a struggling bakery and a pawnbroker's on Bleecker Street in the West Village.  The streetlights, blurred by the downpour, cast an orange glow on the wet cobblestones, illuminating the overflowing trash cans and the occasional stray cat seeking shelter. Inside, Bea, a whirlwind of auburn curls and surprisingly strong hands, wrestled with a particularly stubborn tangle of extensions, muttering curses under her breath that were far more colourful than the pastel shades adorning her work station.  The only other sound was the rhythmic *snip-snip* of her shears, a counterpoint to the relentless drumming of the rain.
