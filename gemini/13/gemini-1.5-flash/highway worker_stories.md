The rasping whine of the asphalt cutter sliced through the humid Louisiana air like a rusty saw through butter.  Cicadas buzzed a relentless counterpoint, their song a deafening chorus to the drone of passing eighteen-wheelers on I-10.  Sweat stung Elias “Eli” Jackson’s eyes, blurring the already shimmering heat haze rising from the blacktop.  He wiped his brow with the back of a calloused hand, the grime smearing across his already sun-baked skin.  The air hung thick and heavy, scented with diesel fumes, overripe mangoes, and the faintly acrid smell of burning rubber from a tire blowout earlier that morning – a Tuesday just like any other Tuesday on this stretch of highway between Lafayette and Baton Rouge. Eli adjusted the brim of his faded orange safety hat, the Louisiana sun beating down mercilessly.  Another pothole to fill, another mile of cracked asphalt to repair.  Another day closer to retirement, if he lived that long.
