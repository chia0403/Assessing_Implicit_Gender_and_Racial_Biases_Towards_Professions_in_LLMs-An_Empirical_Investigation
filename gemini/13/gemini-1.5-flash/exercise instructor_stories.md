The salt spray kissed Amelia “Mia” Hernandez’s face as she jogged along the windswept cliff path overlooking the churning Pacific.  The dawn sky, a bruised purple bleeding into hesitant rose, mirrored the intensity burning in her own chest.  Mia, a whirlwind of tightly-coiled auburn hair and powerful, lean muscles honed by years of intense physical training, wasn't just enjoying the pre-dawn solitude; she was fueling the fire that kept her "Body by Mia" fitness empire burning bright.  Below, the sleepy town of Seabrook, California, still clung to the darkness, unaware that within the next hour, its residents would be charging into their day, propelled by the energy she was about to unleash in her sunrise yoga session on the beach. The air, thick with the smell of brine and impending rain, held a promise of both challenge and exhilaration – a perfect metaphor for the day, and for Mia’s life.
