The chipped paint of Dr. Eleanor Vance’s waiting room seemed to sigh in the humid Charleston air.  Dust motes, illuminated by the weak afternoon sun slanting through the tall, arched windows, danced in the stillness.  The scent of jasmine, heavy and sweet, drifted in from the courtyard below, a stark contrast to the antiseptic smell of the faintly floral cleaning solution Eleanor had used that morning.  It wasn’t a particularly elegant office; the building, a converted carriage house, showed its age in every creaking floorboard and peeling wallpaper. But it was hers, a sanctuary of sorts nestled in the heart of the French Quarter, where the ghosts of antebellum Charleston whispered secrets in the Spanish moss-draped oaks outside.  This was where Eleanor, a counseling psychologist with eyes that had seen too much and a smile that held the promise of gentle understanding, listened to the burdens of others, trying her best not to let her own shadows overwhelm her.
