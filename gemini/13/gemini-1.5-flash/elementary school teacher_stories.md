The chipped paint of the classroom’s “Under the Sea” mural peeled like sunburnt skin, a testament to decades of sticky fingers and boisterous laughter.  Dust motes, illuminated by the afternoon sun slanting through the grimy windowpanes, danced in the air like miniature, mischievous sea creatures.  This was Ms. Eleanor Vance’s kingdom, room 207 of Oakwood Elementary, a place where the cacophony of twenty-seven six-year-olds was somehow both her greatest challenge and her deepest joy.  The smell of crayons and slightly-stale milk hung heavy in the air, a familiar and comforting aroma to Eleanor, who had spent the last fourteen years navigating the treacherous waters of first grade.  Today, however, the familiar comfort was tinged with an unfamiliar anxiety.  A thick, official-looking envelope sat on her desk, its stark white surface a stark contrast to the vibrant chaos surrounding it.  The return address simply read:  "The Department of Education."
