The biting Antarctic wind howled a mournful symphony around Dr. Evelyn Ainsworth, its icy fingers probing the gaps in her thermal layers.  She hunched deeper into her parka, the collar scratching against her already chapped cheeks.  The air, thin and brittle as shattered glass, tasted of ozone and the faint, metallic tang of blood â€“ penguin blood, most likely.  Before her, the vast, unforgiving expanse of the Ross Ice Shelf stretched to the horizon, a frozen ocean under a sky the colour of bruised plums.  The research station, a cluster of squat, snow-dusted buildings clinging precariously to the ice, seemed miles away, a fragile outpost against the monumental indifference of the Antarctic wilderness.  Evelyn, however, was not concerned with the weather; her focus was far, far below the ice, in the inky black depths of the Southern Ocean, where a secret lay buried beneath a thousand feet of frozen water.
