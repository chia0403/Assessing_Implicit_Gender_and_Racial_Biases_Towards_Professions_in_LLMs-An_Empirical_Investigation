The biting November wind howled a mournful tune down Bleaker Street, rattling the loose windowpanes of the terraced houses and whistling through the gaps in Bartholomew "Barty" Butterfield's ancient van.  Barty, a plumber whose hands were perpetually stained a symphony of rust and grease, shivered despite the thick wool of his overalls.  He slammed the van door shut, the sound echoing in the eerily quiet street, a street lined with identical, soot-stained brick houses, each one a potential plumbing disaster waiting to happen.  The faint scent of coal smoke and damp earth hung heavy in the air, a familiar aroma that clung to the very fabric of this forgotten corner of Grimsborough.  His call was to number 27, a notoriously drafty Victorian monstrosity with a reputation for leaky pipes and even leakier tenants.  Barty sighed, pulling his worn leather gloves tighter.  Another day, another potential plumbing apocalypse.
