The brass nameplate on the mahogany door gleamed under the flickering gaslight:  *Hôtel de la Lune – Concierge:  Armand Marcel Dubois*.  Armand, a man whose age was as carefully concealed as the contents of the hotel's most exclusive suites, adjusted his impeccably knotted cravat.  Rain lashed against the arched windows of the lobby, a relentless percussion against the hushed elegance within.  The scent of old leather, expensive perfume, and something faintly floral – lilies, perhaps, or the more exotic tuberose – hung heavy in the air.  Tonight, however, the usual quiet refinement of the Hôtel de la Lune felt…charged.  A palpable tension vibrated from the polished marble floors, a tremor that ran deeper than the storm raging outside.  A crumpled telegram lay on his polished desk, its message, written in a frantic hand, already seared into his memory:  *Find her. Before they do.*
