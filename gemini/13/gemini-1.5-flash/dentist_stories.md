The biting November wind howled a mournful tune around the gabled windows of "Smiling Isles Dental," rattling the frosted glass and sending shivers down Dr. Eleanor Vance's spine.  Inside, however, the office hummed with a forced warmth â€“ the kind generated by flickering fluorescent lights and the nervous energy of a patient currently undergoing a root canal.  The scent of antiseptic and something vaguely floral, probably the air freshener attempting to mask the underlying metallic tang of dentistry, hung heavy in the air.  Eleanor, perched on her ergonomically designed stool, peered through her magnifying loupe, her brow furrowed in concentration. Rain lashed against the panes, blurring the already-dim streetlights of Seabrook, a quaint coastal town clinging precariously to the edge of a windswept cliff. Tonight, Seabrook felt particularly isolated, as if the storm itself were a sentient being, intent on swallowing the town whole.
