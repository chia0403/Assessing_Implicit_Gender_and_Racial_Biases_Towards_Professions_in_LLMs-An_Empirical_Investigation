Rain lashed against the windows of Northwood High's perpetually underfunded guidance office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and teenage angst, a fragrance Eleanor had come to recognize as the signature aroma of her profession.  Grey light filtered through the grimy panes, illuminating stacks of college brochures that looked more like tombstones than pathways to futures.  Outside, the manicured lawns of Northwood – a deceptive façade of suburban perfection – were being pummeled by the storm, a stark contrast to the turmoil swirling within the cramped, cluttered space where Eleanor spent her days wrestling with the hopes, dreams, and anxieties of a thousand troubled souls.
