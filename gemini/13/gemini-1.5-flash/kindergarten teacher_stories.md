The chipped paint of the "Welcome to Ms. Eleanor Vance's Class!" sign flaked onto the vibrant, slightly sticky linoleum floor like a miniature, colourful snowfall.  It was a fitting metaphor for the chaotic beauty of Eleanor Vance's kindergarten classroom at Sunny Meadows Elementary.  Crayon shavings littered the carpet like fallen confetti from a particularly boisterous party, a testament to the day's artistic endeavors.  The air hung thick with the sweet scent of glue, the faint tang of wet paint, and the underlying, ever-present aroma of tiny humans – a mix that Eleanor, after fifteen years of teaching, had come to find strangely comforting.  Today, however, the usual joyful cacophony was subdued, replaced by an unnerving silence, broken only by the rhythmic tick-tock of the oversized, brightly coloured clock hanging above the dramatic play area – a clock that, Eleanor noticed with a growing unease, seemed to be ticking a little… faster.
