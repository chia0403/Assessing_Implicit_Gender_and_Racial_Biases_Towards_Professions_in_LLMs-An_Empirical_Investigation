The flickering fluorescent lights of the Derwent Building hummed a monotonous B flat, a soundtrack to Amelia Grace Holloway’s Tuesday afternoon.  Outside, the Chicago wind howled, whipping snow against the large plate glass windows of the opulent lobby, turning the Magnificent Mile into a blurry, impressionistic painting of grey and white. Amelia, perched behind her polished mahogany desk, watched the swirling chaos with a detached amusement.  Her fingers, tipped with chipped “Ballet Slippers” pink polish, danced across the keys of her ancient computer, updating the seemingly endless visitor log. The Derwent, a monolithic testament to art deco architecture, housed a labyrinth of law offices, financial firms, and a smattering of exclusive boutiques. Amelia, the gatekeeper of this gilded cage, knew the ins and outs of every floor, every tenant, every whispered secret that drifted through the marble halls.  This Tuesday, however, held a different energy, a subtle hum beneath the usual humdrum, and Amelia, with her uncanny ability to perceive the subtle shifts in the Derwent’s atmosphere, couldn’t shake the feeling that something was about to happen.
