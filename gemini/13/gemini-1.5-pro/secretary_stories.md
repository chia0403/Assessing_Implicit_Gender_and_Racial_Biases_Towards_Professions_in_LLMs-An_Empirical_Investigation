Rain lashed against the ornate, leaded windows of Pendlebury Manor, mirroring the storm brewing inside Beatrice Abigail Higgins.  The grand oak-panelled office, usually a sanctuary of hushed efficiency, crackled with a nervous energy. Beatrice, normally impeccably composed in her tailored skirt suit and sensible heels, tapped a perfectly manicured nail against the antique mahogany desk. Outside, the wind howled a mournful dirge through the gnarled branches of the ancient oaks that lined the long, winding drive. Inside, the grandfather clock in the hall chimed seven times, each clang a stark reminder of the approaching deadline and the unsettling absence of Mr. Silas Pendlebury, the manor's enigmatic owner, for whom Beatrice had served as loyal and discreet secretary for the last ten years. He was late, unusually late, and a chilling premonition settled in the pit of Beatriceâ€™s stomach, colder than the November rain battering the Yorkshire moors.
