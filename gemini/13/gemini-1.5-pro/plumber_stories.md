The rusty pipe screeched like a banshee, its protest echoing through the cavernous, dust-choked basement of the Blackwood Manor.  Water, the colour of weak tea and smelling faintly of sulfur, dripped onto the cracked concrete floor, each drop a tiny metronome marking the slow decay of the once-grand estate.  Eleanor Vance Blackwood, clad in grease-stained overalls and a faded purple beanie pulled low over her brow, sighed.  This was the third call to the Blackwood Manor this month, and each visit revealed a new plumbing catastrophe waiting to happen.  The grand old house seemed determined to crumble back into the earth, pipe by rusted pipe.  Outside, the late October wind howled through the gnarled branches of the ancient oaks that surrounded the property, their leaves a swirling tapestry of crimson and gold. The sun, a pale disc in the grey afternoon sky, cast long, skeletal shadows across the unkempt lawn, lending an air of melancholic beauty to the scene.
