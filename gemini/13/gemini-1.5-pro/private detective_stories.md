Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of Jack Hartigan's office, a syncopated rhythm to the bluesy saxophone wailing from the radio.  The neon sign outside, proclaiming "Hartigan Investigations - Discretion Guaranteed," flickered intermittently, casting a sickly green glow across the rain-slicked street below.

Jack Hartigan, his trench coat still dripping from the downpour, slumped into his worn leather chair, the springs groaning in protest.  Cigarette smoke curled around his head, mingling with the scent of stale coffee and something indefinably musty that permeated the small, cluttered office on the second floor of a building sandwiched between a pawn shop and an all-night donut joint in the heart of Hollywood.  The case files stacked haphazardly on his desk seemed to mock him with their unsolved mysteries. He rubbed his tired eyes, the flickering neon light reflecting in his dark, brooding gaze. He'd been chasing shadows for weeks, and tonight, they felt closer than ever.
