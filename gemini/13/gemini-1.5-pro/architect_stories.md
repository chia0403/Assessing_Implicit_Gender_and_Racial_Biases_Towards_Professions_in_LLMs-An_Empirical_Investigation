The biting wind whipped around Alistair Finch, stinging his cheeks and tugging at the blueprints clutched in his gloved hands.  He squinted up at the skeletal frame of the building against the slate-grey Glasgow sky.  Rain, a constant companion in this city, threatened to unleash itself again.  Around him, the construction site buzzed with activity: the clang of metal on metal, the shouts of foremen, the rumble of heavy machinery.  But Alistair was oblivious to it all, his focus entirely on the emerging form of the Clyde Auditorium, his most ambitious project yet. Its curving lines, inspired by the upturned hulls of ships that once lined the nearby river, were slowly taking shape. This wasn’t just a building; it was Alistair's symphony in steel and glass, a testament to his vision of a revitalized Glasgow, rising phoenix-like from its industrial past.  He felt a thrill, a mixture of excitement and trepidation, as he imagined the finished structure, a beacon of culture on the banks of the Clyde. But the wind seemed to whisper a warning, carrying with it the faint scent of the river and something else… something darker, something Alistair couldn't quite place.
