The clatter of horse-drawn carriages on cobblestones filtered through the lace-curtained window of Miss Seraphina Moreauâ€™s atelier, a melody as familiar to her as her own heartbeat.  Located on Rue du Cygne, a narrow, charming street in the heart of 1888 Paris, the small shop overflowed with bolts of silk, spools of thread in every imaginable hue, and half-finished gowns draped over dress forms.  Dust motes danced in the golden afternoon light that streamed in, illuminating the intricate beadwork on a nearly-completed ball gown, a frothy confection of ivory tulle and pearl embroidery.  Seraphina, her dark hair pinned back with a silver comb, stood hunched over her worktable, the faint scent of lavender emanating from the small sachet pinned to her apron. Her brow was furrowed in concentration as she meticulously stitched a row of tiny seed pearls onto the bodice, her nimble fingers moving with a practiced grace that belied the nervous flutter in her stomach.  This particular gown was not just another commission; it was her ticket to the prestigious Parisian Design Exposition, and the potential gateway to a future beyond the confines of her small, but beloved, atelier.
