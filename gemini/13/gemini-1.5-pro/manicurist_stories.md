The bell above the door of "Nailed It," nestled between a laundromat and a suspiciously empty storefront advertising "Authentic Bavarian Pastries," jingled merrily, announcing the arrival of yet another Tuesday morning client.  Elara Rosalind Finch, whose own nails were perpetually adorned with intricate, miniature works of art, sighed inwardly. Tuesdays were always slow, a bleak wasteland between the manic rush of Mondays and the pre-weekend buzz of Wednesdays.  The salon itself, painted a calming shade of lavender that clashed violently with the neon orange of the laundromat next door, was quiet.  Only the gentle hum of the UV lamp and the distant rumble of a washing machine punctuated the stillness.  Rain lashed against the large front window, blurring the already dreary view of Main Street, Harmony Springs.  Elara hoped it wasn't another Mrs. Higgins, demanding her usual French tips and spending the entire appointment complaining about the rising price of cat food.
