The fluorescent lights of the Chilton Public Library hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack Elias Thorne had grown accustomed to over his fifteen years as head librarian.  The air, perpetually tinged with the scent of aging paper and lemon-scented polish, hung heavy with the quiet expectation of a Tuesday afternoon in November.  Outside, a damp, grey sky pressed down on the small town of Chilton, nestled in the rolling hills of Vermont.  Rain lashed against the tall, arched windows, blurring the view of the town square where a lone, bronze statue of Ethan Allen, perpetually mid-stride, faced the downpour with stoic indifference.  Elias, perched behind his mahogany desk, meticulously cataloging a newly acquired collection of first edition Steinbeck novels, felt a familiar sense of peace settle over him.  He preferred the quiet days. The days when the library was his own private sanctuary, a refuge from the sometimes-suffocating friendliness of Chiltonâ€™s residents.  Little did he know, this particular Tuesday was about to shatter the tranquil rhythm of his existence.
