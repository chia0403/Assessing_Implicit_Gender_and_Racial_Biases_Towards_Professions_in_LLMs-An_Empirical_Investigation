The damp chill of a November evening seeped through the cracked windowpanes of the Grand Majestic Theatre, clinging to the velvet curtains like a spectral embrace. Dust motes, illuminated by a single bare bulb hanging precariously from the fly gallery, danced in the cavernous space.  The air, thick with the ghosts of forgotten performances and the faint scent of stale popcorn, hummed with a peculiar energy, a blend of decay and potential. This was where Elias Thorne, a man whose theatrical vision bordered on obsession, intended to stage his comeback.  His last production, a daringly avant-garde interpretation of Macbeth set in a post-apocalyptic laundromat, had been a spectacular flop, leaving him both professionally and financially ruined. Now, armed with a tattered copy of Ibsen’s “Ghosts” and a cast of enthusiastic, if somewhat amateur, local actors, Elias was determined to reclaim his place amongst the theatrical elite. The Grand Majestic, once a glittering jewel of the vaudeville circuit, now a crumbling testament to forgotten dreams, was his chosen battleground.
