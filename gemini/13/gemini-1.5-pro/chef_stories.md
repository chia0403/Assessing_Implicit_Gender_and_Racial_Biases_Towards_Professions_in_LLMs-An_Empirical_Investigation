The biting November wind whipped around Esmeralda "Esme" Dubois, plastering strands of her fiery red hair across her chapped lips. She tugged her worn wool coat tighter around her, the scent of woodsmoke and brine clinging to its fibers.  Grimsby, a small fishing town perched precariously on the edge of the North Sea, wasn't known for its balmy weather, but this year, winter seemed to have arrived with a particularly vicious bite.  The cobbled streets, usually bustling with the day's catch being hauled ashore, were nearly deserted.  Only the flickering gas lamps, casting long, skeletal shadows against the stone buildings, offered a semblance of warmth against the encroaching darkness. Esme hurried towards "The Salty Siren," a ramshackle pub and eatery clinging to the cliff edge, its windows glowing a welcoming amber against the slate-grey sky. It was her kitchen, her sanctuary, and tonight, it held a secret she wasn't quite ready to share.
