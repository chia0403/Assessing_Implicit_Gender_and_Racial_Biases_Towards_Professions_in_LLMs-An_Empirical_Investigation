The biting November wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the hemlocks, clawing at Elijah Jedediah Blackwood's thick flannel shirt.  Frost glittered on the fallen leaves, crunching under his heavy boots as he surveyed the stand of Douglas fir.  The Cascade Mountains of Washington State, a tapestry of evergreens and granite peaks, pressed in around him, their majesty dwarfed only by the colossal trees marked for felling.  A thin plume of smoke snaked upwards from the logging camp nestled in the valley below, a temporary scar on the otherwise pristine landscape.  Elijah breathed deep, the sharp scent of pine filling his lungs.  This was his life, his legacy, a rhythm of axes and saws echoing through generations of Blackwoods before him.  But something felt different this morning, a prickle of unease beneath the familiar chill.
