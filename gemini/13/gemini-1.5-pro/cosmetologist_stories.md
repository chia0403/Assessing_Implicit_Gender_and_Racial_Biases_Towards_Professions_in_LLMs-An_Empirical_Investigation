The flickering neon sign of "Shear Perfection" cast a lurid, magenta glow across the rain-slicked asphalt of Elm Street. Inside, amidst the chemical scent of perms and the hum of hair dryers, Elara Vivienne Dupres sighed, wiping a stray strand of bleach-blonde hair from her cheek.  It was a Tuesday night in the sleepy town of Havenwood, Oregon, and the only other person in the salon was Mrs. Henderson, whose weekly blue rinse was taking longer than usual thanks to a particularly spirited discussion about the mayor's new poodle. Rain lashed against the large window, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Elara. Havenwood, with its quaint charm and gossipy inhabitants, felt more like a gilded cage than a sanctuary. She yearned for the vibrant energy of the city, the flash of cameras, the runway lights â€“ a world far removed from the gentle whir of Mrs. Henderson's hair dryer.  Tonight, however, escape felt further away than ever.
