Inside, the air hummed with the faint scent of dried paint and the slightly sweeter aroma of the playdough Eleanor had painstakingly kneaded the previous afternoon. Rainbow-colored paper chains draped across the ceiling, interspersed with glittery construction paper butterflies, testament to the tireless creativity of her five-year-old charges.
