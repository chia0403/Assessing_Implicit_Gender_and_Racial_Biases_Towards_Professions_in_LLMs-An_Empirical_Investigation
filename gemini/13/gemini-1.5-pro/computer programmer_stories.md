The flickering neon sign of the "Binary Bean" cast a sickly green glow across Amelia "Amy" Chen's rain-streaked glasses.  Seattle, in late November, was a city perpetually draped in twilight, the kind that seeped into your bones and made even the brightest computer screens feel inadequate. Amy, hunched deeper into her threadbare coat, pushed open the cafe's door, a jangle of mismatched bells announcing her arrival. Inside, the air was thick with the aroma of burnt coffee and the low hum of overworked laptops.  Rain lashed against the large windows, blurring the city lights into a hazy, impressionistic painting. Amy, a software engineer at the cutting-edge tech firm "Chronosync,"  was supposed to be home, enjoying a rare Friday night off. But a cryptic email, received just an hour ago, had lured her back out into the downpour, a digital breadcrumb trail leading her to this particular haven for caffeine-fueled night owls. The email contained only a single line: "Find me at the Binary Bean.  Time is running out."
