The relentless Miami sun beat down on the Art Deco facade of the "Body By Beatriz" studio, turning the turquoise paint a shade closer to electric blue. Inside, the air throbbed with the bass-heavy rhythm of Pitbull, a soundtrack perfectly suited to Beatriz "Bea" Rodriguez's high-energy Zumba class.  Bea, all tanned limbs and boundless energy, bounced in front of the mirrored wall, her black ponytail whipping around like a metronome.  Sweat plastered her vibrant orange tank top to her back, but her smile never faltered.  Outside, the humid air hung heavy with the promise of a tropical storm, but inside, Bea's infectious enthusiasm generated its own kind of tempest.  This Tuesday morning class, usually packed with retirees and stay-at-home moms, was strangely sparse. Only four women occupied the normally bustling studio, their faces reflecting a mix of exertion and vague unease. Bea, oblivious to the subtle shift in atmosphere,  yelled encouragement over the music, her voice a powerful counterpoint to the rumbling thunder that began to roll in the distance.
