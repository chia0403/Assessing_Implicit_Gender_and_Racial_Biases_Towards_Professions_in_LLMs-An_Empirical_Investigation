The biting wind whipped Judge Amelia Iris Thorne's crimson robe around her ankles as she ascended the granite steps of the Anchorage Courthouse.  Glacier-carved mountains loomed over the city, their peaks obscured by a swirling grey sky heavy with the promise of snow.  Anchorage, still clinging to the last vestiges of autumn, was a city of stark contrasts that November morning:  the fiery hues of dying leaves clinging desperately to skeletal branches, juxtaposed against the steely, unforgiving landscape. Inside the courthouse, the fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune, a stark contrast to the raw, untamed beauty outside.  Judge Thorne, her face etched with a weariness that belied her forty-two years, pushed open the heavy oak doors, the scent of old paper and stale coffee greeting her like an unwelcome guest.  This was her city, her courtroom, her burden.  And today, she knew, would be a day unlike any other.
