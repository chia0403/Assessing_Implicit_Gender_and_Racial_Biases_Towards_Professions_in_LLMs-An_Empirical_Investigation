The relentless Chicago wind, sharp as broken glass, whipped around Detective Isabella “Izzy” Diaz, tugging at the edges of her navy overcoat and sending strands of dark hair escaping from beneath her knit cap.  She stood on the corner of Wabash and Jackson, the skeletal frame of a half-constructed skyscraper looming over her like a metal ribcage against the bruised pre-dawn sky.  Below, the city still slept, cloaked in a deceptive tranquility.  The only sounds were the distant rumble of an elevated train and the rhythmic hiss of a faulty streetlight casting a flickering, sickly yellow glow over the scene.  Red and blue flashing lights pulsed from two squad cars parked haphazardly by a dumpster overflowing with debris.  A body lay sprawled on the icy pavement, covered by a white sheet that stirred gently in the biting wind, a stark contrast to the dark, spreading stain beneath it.  Izzy’s breath plumed in the frigid air as she surveyed the scene, her dark eyes, sharp and observant, taking in every detail. This was her city, and this, unfortunately, was a familiar ritual.
