The relentless Oregon rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Coastal Rehab, a rhythmic drumming that mirrored the dull ache in Elias Thorne's lower back.  He shifted on his stool, the worn leather creaking in protest. The clinic, nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually empty storefront in the sleepy coastal town of Astoria, was quiet this Tuesday morning. The salty tang of the Pacific hung heavy in the air, mingling with the antiseptic scent of rubbing alcohol and the faint, metallic tang of Elias's own anxiety.  He stared out the large front window, watching the grey chop of the ocean, his breath fogging the glass.  At thirty-two, Elias had imagined his life differently. Heâ€™d envisioned a bustling practice in a vibrant city, not the slow drip of patients in a town where the biggest excitement was the annual salmon run.  Today, however, even the salmon seemed to be avoiding Astoria.
