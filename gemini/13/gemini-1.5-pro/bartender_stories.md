Rain lashed against the stained-glass windows of The Gilded Lily, blurring the neon glow of the "Cocktails & Dreams" sign hanging askew above the entrance. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of stale beer, cheap perfume, and desperation.  Amelia “Amy” Hawthorne, her auburn hair pulled back in a tight bun, polished a chipped highball glass with a practiced hand, her gaze distant as she watched the rivulets of water race each other down the grimy pane. The Lily, nestled in the heart of the forgotten borough of Alder’s Point, wasn't much, but it was her domain.  Every scuff mark on the mahogany bar, every crack in the vinyl booths, whispered tales of broken hearts, fleeting triumphs, and the quiet desperation that clung to the town like the ever-present fog rolling in from the bay.  Tonight, like most nights, the only other occupant was old Mr. Henderson, nursing a lukewarm whiskey and staring morosely into the swirling ice, a monument to lost loves and faded dreams.  The clock above the bar chimed a mournful eleven, and Amy knew, with a weary certainty, that tonight would be another long one.
