Rain lashed against the grimy windows of The Mariner's Rest, blurring the neon glow of the "Vacancy" sign. Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of stale beer and fried fish, punctuated by the mournful drone of a sea shanty playing on the jukebox. Elias Thorne, a journalist with the Boston Chronicle, hunched deeper into his worn leather jacket, the collar pulled high to ward off the chill that seeped in from the Nova Scotian coast.  Yarmouth, a usually bustling fishing town, felt eerily deserted tonight, the only other occupants of the bar a grizzled fisherman nursing a pint and the barkeep, a woman with eyes as deep and grey as the Atlantic churning just beyond the harbour walls. Elias tapped his pen against his notepad, the blank page mocking the emptiness in his mind. He’d come to Yarmouth chasing a story – a whisper of strange lights out at sea, unexplained disappearances of fishing boats.  So far, all he'd found was a persistent drizzle and a growing sense of unease.
