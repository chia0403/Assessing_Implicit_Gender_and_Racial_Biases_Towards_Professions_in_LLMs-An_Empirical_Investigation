The fluorescent lights of McKinley High hummed a monotonous B flat, a soundtrack to Ms. Eleanor Vance's Tuesday morning.  Rain lashed against the large window behind her desk, blurring the view of the football field into a swirling green and grey abstraction. Eleanor, her auburn hair pulled back in a neat bun, tapped a chipped mug of lukewarm tea against her teeth.  Her office, a small, cluttered space crammed between the principal's office and the boys' locker room, was a testament to her fifteen years at McKinley. College pennants plastered one wall, interspersed with framed inspirational quotes chosen more for their irony than their sentiment.  A half-deflated stress ball shaped like the earth sat perched precariously on a stack of student files, a silent testament to the weight of teenage angst she carried on her shoulders.  This particular Tuesday, however, felt heavier than most.  A thick manila envelope sat on her desk, marked "Confidential," its contents threatening to disrupt the fragile ecosystem of McKinley High in ways she couldn't yet fathom.
