The rusty squeak of the barber's pole, perpetually fighting a losing battle against the Cape Cod wind, was the only sound that punctuated the otherwise quiet hum of a Tuesday morning in Seashell Cove.  Inside "Shear Perfection," the air smelled of bay rum, talcum powder, and the faint, metallic tang of freshly sharpened scissors.  Sunlight, filtered through the large front window overlooking the harbor, glinted off the chrome and porcelain surfaces. Elijah "Eli" Wainwright, his name stitched in elegant script on the breast pocket of his crisp white shirt, stood surveying his domain, a small, meticulously organized shop that had been in his family for three generations.  The worn leather of the barber chairs, the framed black and white photographs of past Wainwrights wielding combs and clippers, and the antique cash register, a relic from a simpler time, all whispered stories of a bygone era, a slower pace of life that Eli clung to with both hands. The bell above the door chimed, announcing his first customer, and Eli, a slight smile playing on his lips, turned to greet them.
