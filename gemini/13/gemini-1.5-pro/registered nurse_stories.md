The biting November wind whipped off Lake Superior, stinging Amelia Hayes's cheeks as she hurried across the deserted parking lot of St. Jude's Memorial Hospital.  The sky, a bruised purple fading to inky black, mirrored the churning water below.

Tonight was Amelia's first night shift in the newly opened palliative care ward, and a knot of unease tightened in her stomach.  She pushed through the heavy glass doors, the warmth of the lobby a welcome reprieve from the biting wind, but the feeling of disquiet lingered.
