The clatter of mismatched cutlery and the low hum of forced air conditioning were the soundtrack to Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez's life.  The Golden Spoon Diner, a greasy beacon on the edge of Highway 17 in dusty, sun-baked Harmony Creek, Nevada, was her kingdom, or at least, her fiefdom.  It was 11:47 am on a Tuesday, the slowest day of the week, and the only other occupants were a couple of truckers nursing lukewarm coffee at the counter and old Mr. Henderson, perpetually parked in booth number four, meticulously dissecting his daily special of meatloaf and mashed potatoes.  The air hung thick with the scent of frying onions and stale cigarette smoke, a perfume Amy had long since stopped noticing.  Sunlight, bleached by the desert heat, streamed through the grime-streaked windows, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the air.  Amy, in her faded turquoise uniform and scuffed white sneakers, leaned against the counter, idly polishing a coffee cup, the quiet before the lunchtime rush a fragile, fleeting peace.
