The flickering fluorescent lights of the Darrow & Sons Architectural Firm buzzed like trapped wasps, casting a pale, sickly glow over Amelia Reyes’ drafting table.  It was 5:57 pm on a Tuesday, the kind of Tuesday that felt indistinguishable from the Tuesday before it, and the Tuesday before that. Outside, the Chicago wind howled, rattling the aging windows of the converted warehouse. Amelia, her dark hair pulled back in a tight bun, hunched over a blueprint for a new luxury condominium complex – another glass and steel behemoth destined to pierce the city skyline.  The smell of stale coffee and blueprint fixative hung heavy in the air, a permanent fixture of the office since 1958, when old man Darrow first set up shop. The only other sound, apart from the wind and the buzzing lights, was the rhythmic scratching of Amelia's 0.5mm mechanical pencil against the vellum.  She chewed thoughtfully on the end of it, a nervous habit from her college days, her brow furrowed in concentration as she worked out a tricky intersection of support beams.  The deadline was looming, and Mr. Henderson, her perpetually stressed supervisor, had made it abundantly clear that no slip-ups would be tolerated.
