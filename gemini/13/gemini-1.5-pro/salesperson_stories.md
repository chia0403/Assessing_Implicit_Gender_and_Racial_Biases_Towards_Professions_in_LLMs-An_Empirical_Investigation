The flickering neon sign of the Starlight Motel cast a lurid, purple glow across Amelia Grace Holloway’s sensible navy sedan. Rain lashed against the windshield, blurring the already desolate landscape of Highway 17 in rural Nevada.  Amelia sighed, the stale air of cheap coffee and peppermint breath mints clinging to the interior of the car. She’d been driving for eleven hours straight, chasing a lead on a potential client – a rancher named Jedidiah who supposedly needed a whole fleet of new irrigation systems. Jedidiah, she’d been assured by her boss, was a “sure thing.”  But after three missed calls and a voicemail box fuller than a Thanksgiving turkey, Amelia was starting to suspect that Jedidiah, and perhaps her boss, were full of something else entirely.  The desert stretched out before her, a vast, unforgiving expanse punctuated by gnarled Joshua trees that seemed to claw at the stormy sky.  This was her last chance to make quota this quarter.  If Jedidiah didn't pan out, Amelia wasn't sure she could stomach another month of instant noodles and lukewarm motel coffee.
