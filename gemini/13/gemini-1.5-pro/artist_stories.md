The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face as he hunched deeper into his threadbare coat, the collar pulled high against the biting November wind.  The Isle of Skye, usually a canvas of vibrant greens and blues, was muted today, a palette of greys and storm-bruised purples.  The sky, a vast, swirling cauldron, threatened to unleash another deluge upon the small, windswept village of Portree, where Elias had rented a tiny cottage overlooking the harbour.  His fingers, stiff with cold despite the fingerless gloves, clutched a worn sketchbook, its pages filled with charcoal sketches of the dramatic cliffs, the restless sea, and the stoic faces of the island's inhabitants.  He’d come seeking inspiration, a refuge from the clamour of London’s art scene and the gnawing doubt that had begun to creep into his work. He hoped the raw, untamed beauty of Skye would reignite the fire within him, a fire that felt dangerously close to flickering out.
