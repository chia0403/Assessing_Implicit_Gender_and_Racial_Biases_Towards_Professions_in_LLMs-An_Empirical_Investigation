The insistent chirping of a robin, perched precariously on the windowsill, pulled Amelia Hayes from her grading.  Rain hammered against the glass panes of her classroom, turning the world outside into a shimmering, grey blur.  Room 2B of Maplewood Elementary was a kaleidoscope of color, a stark contrast to the dreary November day.  Paper pumpkins, lopsidedly grinning, still hung from the ceiling, remnants of a Halloween celebration now weeks past.  A faded alphabet chart lined one wall, while the other showcased proudly displayed, if slightly smudged, artwork from her second-graders.  The scent of damp wool and crayon wax hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Amelia.  She sighed, rubbing the bridge of her nose, a small stack of spelling tests still waiting to be marked.  Recess had been cancelled due to the downpour, and the restless energy of twenty-seven seven-year-olds was practically vibrating in the room.
