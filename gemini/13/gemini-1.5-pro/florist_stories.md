The bell above the door of "Petal & Stem" jingled merrily, a counterpoint to the melancholic drizzle painting the cobblestone streets of Port Blossom, Oregon.  Inside, amidst the heady perfume of lilies and the earthy scent of damp moss, Elsie Willowbrook hummed a tuneless melody as she arranged a cascade of blush-pink roses. Rain lashed against the large storefront window, blurring the view of the sleepy harbor town, transforming it into a watercolor impression of greys and greens.  Elsie, her freckled nose dusted with pollen, adjusted a wayward bloom, her brow furrowed in concentration.  This arrangement, destined for Mrs. Henderson's 80th birthday, had to be perfect.  Not just visually stunning, but emotionally resonant, whispering a story of long life and enduring love.  It was Elsie's gift, this ability to weave narratives with flowers, a talent as natural to her as breathing.  Little did she know, a different kind of story, one far removed from the gentle world of blossoms and bouquets, was about to bloom in Port Blossom, and Elsie Willowbrook was about to find herself playing a most unexpected role.
