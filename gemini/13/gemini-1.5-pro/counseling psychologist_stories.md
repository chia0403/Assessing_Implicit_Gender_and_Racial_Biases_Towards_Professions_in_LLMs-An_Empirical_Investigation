Tonight, those secrets felt particularly heavy, pressing down on her like the storm raging outside. The empty chair opposite her desk, usually occupied by a patient unraveling their anxieties, seemed to pulse with an unseen presence, a harbinger of the disruption that was about to shatter the town's fragile tranquility.
