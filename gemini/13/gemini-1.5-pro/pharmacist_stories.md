The relentless Nevada sun beat down on the dusty asphalt of Harmony Creek, baking the air to a shimmering haze.  Inside Harmony Creek Pharmacy, the air conditioning battled valiantly against the desert's oppressive heat. Eleanor Vance, PharmD, meticulously counted out hydrocodone tablets, her brow furrowed in concentration. The rhythmic click of the pill counter was the only sound in the otherwise silent pharmacy. Eleanor’s neat, ash-blonde bun was starting to unravel in the dry heat, a few stray strands clinging to her perspiring forehead.  Normally, the Tuesday afternoon lull was a welcome respite, a chance to catch up on paperwork or restock the shelves. But today, a sense of unease prickled at the edges of Eleanor's awareness, a subtle discord in the usual desert quiet.  A glint of chrome caught her eye in the rearview mirror attached to the security monitor. A black muscle car, its engine idling, sat parked half a block down, its tinted windows obscuring the occupants within.  Eleanor’s hand instinctively tightened around the prescription bottle.  Harmony Creek wasn't exactly known for its shady characters, but something about this car, and the stillness of the afternoon, felt…wrong.
