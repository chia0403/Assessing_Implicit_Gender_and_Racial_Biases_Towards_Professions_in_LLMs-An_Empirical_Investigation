The biting wind whipped across the obsidian cliffs of the Blacktooth Mountains, carrying with it the faint, metallic tang of snow.  A sliver of moon hung precariously in the inky sky, casting long, skeletal shadows across the fortress of Raven’s Perch.  Built into the very rock itself, the fortress seemed less a construction of man and more an extension of the mountain’s jagged, unforgiving nature.

Cassian Thorne, his breath misting in the frigid air, tightened his grip on the hilt of his sword.  He was posted at the western gate, the most exposed and vulnerable point of the fortress.  Years of service had hardened him to the harsh conditions, yet tonight, a prickle of unease ran down his spine. Something felt… wrong.
