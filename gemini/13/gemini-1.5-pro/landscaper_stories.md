The biting wind whipped at Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's cheeks, turning them the same shade as the crimson berries clinging to the holly bushes she was pruning.  Frost crunched beneath her work boots, a familiar soundtrack to her mornings in late November.  The air, crisp and sharp with the promise of snow, carried the scent of pine needles and damp earth.  Amy, her breath puffing out in white clouds, surveyed her current project: the sprawling grounds of the Hemlock House, a Victorian mansion perched precariously on a bluff overlooking the churning grey waters of the Strait of Juan de Fuca.  The house itself, a gothic behemoth of turrets and gables, loomed over her like a disapproving dowager.  It had been empty for years, whispered to be haunted by the heartbroken spirit of its original owner, a sea captain lost at sea. Amy, a pragmatist by nature and profession, dismissed such tales as local folklore. Her concerns were far more earthly:  the overgrown ivy threatening to strangle the ancient wisteria, the neglected rose garden choked with weeds, and the general air of melancholy hanging over the place â€“ a mood she intended to banish with shears, secateurs, and a healthy dose of elbow grease.
