The siren shrieked, a high-pitched wail that sliced through the thick, humid Florida night. Rain hammered against the windshield of Rescue 27, blurring the neon glow of the strip malls along US-1. Inside, Amelia “Amy” Rodriguez, a paramedic with Miami-Dade Fire Rescue, gripped the chrome handrail as the ambulance bucked over a pothole. Her stomach churned, not from the ride, but from the gnawing anxiety that always accompanied a Code 3 call. Dispatch had been terse: “Possible GSW to the abdomen, Flamingo Park, multiple units responding.” Gunshot wound. In Flamingo Park. That meant tourists, bystanders, chaos.  Amy adjusted the collar of her medic uniform, the starched fabric a cold comfort against the sticky heat.  Flamingo Park, usually a vibrant hub of rollerbladers, salsa dancers, and food trucks, was now a potential warzone, and Amy, with her partner and driver, Carlos "Cal" Diaz, were hurtling towards its epicenter.
