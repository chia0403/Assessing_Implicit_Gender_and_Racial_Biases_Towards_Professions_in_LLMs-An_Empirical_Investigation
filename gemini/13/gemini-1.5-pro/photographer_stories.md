The biting November wind whipped strands of Amelia Reyes's dark hair across her face as she adjusted the tripod on the precipice of Cadwaladr Cliffs.  Below, the slate-grey Irish Sea churned restlessly, its white-capped waves gnawing at the jagged rocks.  The sky, a bruised purple and gunmetal grey, mirrored the turbulent water, promising a storm. Amelia, clad in a thick, waxed cotton jacket and fingerless gloves, ignored the cold seeping into her bones.  She was focused on capturing the raw, untamed beauty of the scene, the very essence of this desolate stretch of the Welsh coastline, a place sheâ€™d felt drawn to ever since she'd seen a photograph of it as a child.  Her Nikon D850, weather-sealed and sturdy in her hands, was an extension of herself, a tool to translate the wild poetry of the landscape into something tangible. This wasn't just a photo shoot; it was a pilgrimage.
