The biting Alaskan wind whipped at Amelia “Ace” Reyes’s parka, stinging her cheeks despite the layers of fleece beneath.  Ice crystals danced in the air, refracting the weak, pre-dawn light into a hazy halo around the twin peaks of Denali, looming in the distance.  Ace stamped her feet, trying to generate some warmth while she pre-flighted her de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver.  The small bush plane, affectionately nicknamed “The Moose,” was her lifeline in this unforgiving wilderness, its red and white paint a splash of colour against the stark white landscape.  This morning's flight was a routine cargo run to the remote mining outpost at Wolverine Creek, nestled deep in a valley carved by glaciers.  Routine, that was, until she saw the single, flashing light on the mountainside, a distress beacon winking faintly against the encroaching dawn.
