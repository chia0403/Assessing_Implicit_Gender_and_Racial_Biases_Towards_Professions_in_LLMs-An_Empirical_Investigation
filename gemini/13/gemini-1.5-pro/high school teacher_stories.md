The fluorescent lights of Mr. Elias Thorne's classroom hummed a monotonous tune, a soundtrack to the pre-dawn quiet. Outside, the sky above Ashwood High, nestled in the heart of the sleepy, orchard-laden town of Harmony Creek, Oregon, was just beginning to blush with the promise of a crisp autumn morning.  Elias, a tall man with perpetually tired eyes and a neatly trimmed beard flecked with grey, ran a hand through his unruly brown hair, already regretting the extra-strong coffee he'd needed to drag himself out of bed at 5:30 am.  He surveyed his domain: rows of empty desks, the periodic table poster slightly askew, and the whiteboard covered in the remnants of yesterday's lesson on Shakespearean sonnets. It was a familiar scene, one that usually brought him a sense of calm, but this morning, a prickle of unease danced beneath his skin.  Something feltâ€¦ off.
