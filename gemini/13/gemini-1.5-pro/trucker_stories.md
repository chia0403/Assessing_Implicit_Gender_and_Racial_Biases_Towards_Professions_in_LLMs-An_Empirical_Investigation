The rusty orange sun bled across the Nevada desert, painting the Joshua trees in fiery silhouettes.  A lone semi, its chrome gleaming dully under the fading light, rumbled down the desolate stretch of Highway 50, otherwise known as the "Loneliest Road in America."  Inside the cab, Delilah “Dee” Palomares rubbed the sleep from her eyes, the lingering scent of stale coffee and diesel hanging heavy in the air.  Her knuckles were white against the worn leather of the steering wheel as she wrestled the behemoth against a sudden gust of wind that threatened to shove her onto the shoulder.  The CB radio crackled with static punctuated by the occasional drawl of a fellow trucker, miles away, complaining about the wind or the price of fuel. Dee glanced at the digital readout on her dashboard: 3:17 AM. Another four hours to Ely, then a quick shower and a nap before the next leg of her haul to Reno.  The vast emptiness stretched out before her, the road an asphalt ribbon disappearing into the inky horizon. It was a familiar loneliness, a comfortable solitude that Dee had come to appreciate in her years crisscrossing the country.  Tonight, however, a different kind of unease prickled at the edges of her awareness, a feeling she couldn't quite place, like a phantom hitchhiker in the sleeper berth behind her.
