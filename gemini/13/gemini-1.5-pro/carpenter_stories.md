The rasping screech of saw against wood echoed through the crisp morning air, punctuated by the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Elias Thorne's hammer.  Frost clung to the splintered edges of the half-built porch railing, sparkling like crushed diamonds in the weak November sun.  Elias, his breath clouding before him, adjusted the thick wool scarf wrapped around his neck and squinted at the intricate joinery he was crafting.
