The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of Wyoming, rattling the windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance’s veterinary clinic.  Snow, fine and sharp as powdered glass, stung her face as she hurried from her battered pickup truck to the clinic’s back entrance.  The sky, a bruised purple-grey, threatened another blizzard.  Inside, the air was thick with the comforting scents of hay, disinfectant, and faint animal musk.  A single bare bulb illuminated the cramped examination room, casting long shadows that danced with the flickering flames in the potbellied stove tucked into the corner.  Eleanor, her auburn braid escaping its confines, stamped the snow from her worn boots, already anticipating the long night ahead. The faint bleating of a lamb from the adjacent holding pen told her it was going to be a particularly challenging one.
