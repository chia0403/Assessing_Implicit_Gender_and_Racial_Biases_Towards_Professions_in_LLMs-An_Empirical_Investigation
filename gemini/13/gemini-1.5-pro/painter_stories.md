The salt spray stung Eliza Jane Moreau's face as she wrestled her easel against the biting wind. The Isle of Skye, in early April, was a fickle mistress. One moment, the sun would break through the clouds, painting the jagged Cuillin mountains in hues of amethyst and gold, the next, a squall would sweep in from the Minch, leaving everything shrouded in a damp, grey mist.  Eliza Jane, her fingers already numb despite her thick woolen gloves, anchored the easelâ€™s legs into the peaty soil overlooking the Fairy Pools.  Crystal-clear turquoise water cascaded down a series of rock formations, creating a scene that looked more like a mythical realm than the Scottish Highlands.  It was this ethereal, ever-shifting beauty that had drawn her here, all the way from her small Parisian studio, in search of a new inspiration, a new light to capture on canvas.  The wind whipped at the edges of her crimson scarf, a splash of vibrant colour against the muted landscape, mirroring the fire she hoped to ignite in her art.
