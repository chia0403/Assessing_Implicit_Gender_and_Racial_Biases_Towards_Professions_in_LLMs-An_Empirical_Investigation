The fluorescent lights of the Quick Stop, a 24-hour convenience store nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually closed-down video rental place, hummed a monotonous B-flat. Amelia Reyes, her nametag slightly askew, leaned against the counter, the worn linoleum cool against her elbows. Outside, the November wind howled down Main Street of Harmony Creek, population 842, whipping fallen leaves into frantic spirals. The digital clock above the lottery tickets blinked 2:37 AM.  Not exactly rush hour. Amelia chewed on the end of a Bic pen, its ink long gone, and watched the flickering reflection of the empty street in the glass doors.  She was certain tonight was going to be another long, slow, and utterly unremarkable shift, just like all the others.  She was wrong.
